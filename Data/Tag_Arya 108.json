How do you know?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cFrom the moss. See how it grows mostly on one side of the trees? That\u2019s south.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWhat do we want with the north?\u201d Gendry wanted to know.<br/>\n\u201cThe Trident.\u201d Arya unrolled the stolen map to show them. \u201cSee? Once we reach the Trident, all we need to do is follow it upstream till we come to Riverrun, here.\u201d Her finger traced the path. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way, but we can\u2019t get lost so long as we keep to the river.\u201d<br/>\nHot Pie blinked at the map. \u201cWhich one is Riverrun?\u201d<br/>\nRiverrun was painted as a castle tower, in the fork between the flowing blue lines of two rivers, the Tumblestone and the Red Fork. \u201cThere.\u201d She touched it. \u201cRiverrun, it reads.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYou can read writing?\u201d he said to her, wonderingly, as if she\u2019d said she could walk on water.<br/>\nShe nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be safe once we reach Riverrun.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWe will? Why?\u201d<br/>\nBecause Riverrun is my grandfather\u2019s castle, and my brother Robb will be there, she wanted to say. She bit her lip and rolled up the map. \u201cWe just will. But only if we get there.\u201d She was the first one back in the saddle. It made her feel bad to hide the truth from Hot Pie, but she did not trust him with her secret. Gendry knew, but that was different. Gendry had his own secret, though even he didn\u2019t seem to know what it was.",

        "question": "A lot of people thought Arya was acting OOC in s7. To me it was more of the same.  They've always used Arya to force sides between her and Sansa.  And it's very black and white.  Arya always sees the worst in Sansa.  Or what she thinks is the worst.  It just looks worse when they are basically adults and she's acting like a petulant child.  My hope is that they really become sisters and see the value in each other.  Do you see this happening in S8?",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>\n\nTo follow up on my ask. Arya also still holds on to some of her earlier childhood perceptions- about Jon (he can do no wrong) about Sansa (she is all about herself) and according to the clip about Dragons (in awe about stories she\u2019s heard). Do you see this having a role in her arc in s8? A lot of her \u201cunreliable\u201d POV set the tone for these characters and the GAs perception. Jon\u2019s a hero. Sansa\u2019s a useless female. And Dany\u2019s her destined bff because she loves dragons and is an atypical female.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>You pose a series of very interesting but quite hard to answer questions. I say it\u2019s hard to answer because firstly we need to take into account the differences between book Arya and show Arya, as well as the Ds inability to write positive female relationships. On top of that, there\u2019s also the trauma that both Sansa and Arya have experienced, the issues they had as children, their very different personalities and ultimately what their story arcs are, or rather what we can theorize their endgame arcs will be.\u00a0</p><p>So the subject of Arya and Sansa\u2019s relationship becomes hard to tackle. Particularly since we tend to pick sides, independent of where in the fandom we are placed. Arya stans will always take Arya\u2019s side in everything, even when Arya behaves in truly terrifying ways (like threatening to cut off her sister\u2019s face) and Sansa and Jonsa stans are somewhat reluctant to look at things from Arya\u2019s perspective (while not excusing her behavior) and talk about how Sansa could have potentially handled things better in relation to her sister in season 7 because for one Sansa is always the one that gets the short end of the stick in the fandom when it comes to her conflicts with Arya (despite the fact that most of them are not her fault) and also because, again and I can\u2019t stress this enough, show Arya went as far as to threaten to cut off her face.\u00a0</p><p>I think when it comes to show Arya, she\u2019s learned to see the worst in people, period. Because the Ds were so focused in season 7 to screw with the Starks, we didn\u2019t get to see what the fallout of Arya\u2019s stint with the Faceless Men really was in terms of her state of mind. But that must have left some pretty deep scars because Arya went there in good faith, on the word of Jaqen H'ghar and ended up joining a death cult instead. Also the waif must have really shattered what little trust she had left.\u00a0</p><p>So by the time she reunites with Sansa, Arya is very much not in a good place emotionally. She\u2019s just come from committing mass murder, after all.\u00a0</p><p>Talking about the Winterfell plot in season 7 is difficult because it\u2019s such a cesspool of bad writing and unearned twists and poor character development, that trying to taking it seriously and actually analyze the characters\u2019 decision making process within that context feels almost not worthwhile.\u00a0</p><p>However, I will say that during Sansa and Arya first meeting in the crypts, there are a few things that become clear:\u00a0</p><p>Arya is dissapointed that Jon is not there since he\u2019s the only reason why she decided to come home. However, she isn\u2019t cruel to Sansa, just apprehensive. Sansa for her part is excited to have Arya back home but she\u2019s pretty awkward around her as well because she doesn\u2019t quite know how to behave. However, once the ice is broken so to speak and they hug for the second time, it\u2019s actually a very sweet moment between the two of them. Which is why the rest of the plot pisses me off as much as it does.\u00a0</p><p>In season 7 we get another clue that Sansa does know Arya as well as accept her for who she is, when she goes to the crypts knowing that Arya would be there. This is after talking to Brienne in season 6 and smiling at the thought of Arya not being dressed like a lady.\u00a0\u201cNo, she wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Sansa says. So it\u2019s actually inaccurate to say that Sansa doesn\u2019t value Arya for who she is.</p><p>Unfortunately the same can\u2019t be said of Arya who from the first moment she meets Sansa in the crypts begins to be dismissive of her. She\u2019s slightly incredulous that Jon left Sansa in charge and things only escalate from there.\u00a0</p><p>Both these girls have huge trust issues that impede them from treating each other like family. It becomes even more apparent that the only reason why Jon and Sansa\u2019s reunion went as smoothly as it did was because of Jon\u2019s willingness to welcome Sansa with open arms and no apprehension.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa tries to do the same with Arya but she doesn\u2019t quite manage to go all the way.\u00a0\u00a0Arya for her part is slightly emotionally cut-off even in the beginning of season 7, which is why probably people feel she was acting OOC. I\u2019m not sure she was but rather that we are not given the proper context as to what has made Arya even more emotionally distant. I\u2019m going to assume that the Faceless Men and the killing of the Freys had an impact on her state of mind but I would have appreciated the writers actually doing the work to present that as opposed to just filming LF smirking in dark corners every other episode.\u00a0</p><p>Then everything is, of course, derailed by Littlefinger so we never see the slow progression of Sansa and Arya\u2019s relationship. But I will say that in order for them to have a real sibling relationship, two things need to happen in season 8:\u00a0</p><p>Arya needs to let go of her internalized misogyny and treat Sansa with respect. Not more digs at her liking to knit or enjoying pretty dresses. No more assumptions that Sansa took the Lord\u2019s Chamber because she\u2019s always liked\u00a0\u201cnice things\u201d. I mean, she didn\u2019t even know what the context of that was. She didn\u2019t know that Jon had the Lord\u2019s Chamber prepared for Sansa and that she didn\u2019t take it for herself. She doesn\u2019t know the full extent of Jon and Sansa\u2019s relationship. And she doesn\u2019t know any of those things because she doesn\u2019t ask. She just jumps to conclusions. She needs to actually give Sansa the benefit of the doubt and stop attacking her at the slightest provocation.\u00a0</p><p>For Sansa\u2019s part, she needs to lower her guard and let Arya in more. Be more vulnerable around her. She\u2019s never going to win the stone face, tough as nails competition with Arya. She\u2019s much better at it than Sansa. The only way she can have a relationship with Arya is if she opens up and let\u2019s Arya get to know her better. She also needs to accept that not everyone is going to be as patient or understanding with her as Jon is. I\u2019m not blaming Sansa for her traumas but looking from the outside, it\u2019s actually pretty hard to deal and relate to someone who is actively trying to keep everyone at arms length and Arya simply does not have the kind of personality that can deal with that in the optimum way.\u00a0</p><p>What I\u2019m trying to say is that Arya and Sansa\u2019s relationship is a work in progress. And I do hope that at some point they will end up being the true sisters that they\u2019re supposed to be. They\u2019ve both been through a lot and they need each other. However, for that to happen they would both need to put in the work and, most importantly, the Ds would have to be capable of writing it. While I think the first can be achieved, I\u2019m not that sure the second is since the Ds prioritize everything in this story above female relationships.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nArya also still holds on to some of her earlier childhood perceptions- about Jon (he can do no wrong) about Sansa (she is all about herself) \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>I can\u2019t really fault Arya for idealizing Jon. He was her closest sibling, her big brother, her protector and number one fan. The thought of Jon kept Arya going through some pretty horrible experiences so I don\u2019t think she will ever care about Sansa the way she cares about Jon. When push comes to shove, she\u2019ll always take Jon\u2019s side over Sansa\u2019s, unless Jon does something truly inexcusable, like let\u2019s say give away Arya\u2019s childhood home to a tyrant with nukes \u2026 or something like that \u2026 just an example, mind you.\u00a0</p><p>So it\u2019s really on Jon, particularly if Jonsa happens, to try to keep these relationships separate and make sure that Sansa doesn\u2019t feel cornered, so to speak. It\u2019s not really fair to him to have to play referee that but that\u2019s what faux-incest does. It inevitably complicates family relationships. lol\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>according to the clip about Dragons (in awe about stories she\u2019s heard)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Again, I\u2019m not sure this is quite odd. Dragons ARE fascinating creatures. They\u2019re huge, they fly, they breathe fire. It\u2019s normal to be in awe of them at first so I don\u2019t see anything wrong with Arya being interested in them. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to continue being in awe of them once she realizes the damage they can cause.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nDany\u2019s her destined bff because she loves dragons and is an atypical female.<br/></p></blockquote><p>This is a fandom invention made by people that hate Sansa and Jonsa. It has nothing to do with Arya\u2019s storyline. Arya stans simply want Arya to continue to hate Sansa because that validates their own hatred of her and D*ny stans want Arya to become D*ny\u2019s handmaiden because she\u2019s Jon\u2019s favorite sister and, as such, her stamp of approval means Jon is going to continue to be D*ny\u2019s lover. It\u2019s insulting to Arya because she\u2019s more than a shoulder to cry on for D*ny and it\u2019s insulting to Jon because he\u2019s a grown ass man who shouldn\u2019t need his little sister to approve of the woman he wants to be in a relationship with.\u00a0</p><p>But the problem with D*ny\u2019s fandom is that it\u2019s essentially a black hole where every other character is sucked of life and energy in order to feed the \u201cD*ny is a godess who deserves for everyone to worship at her feet\u201d mindset.\u00a0</p><p>As far as Arya\u2019s arc in season 8, I think Maisie really laid it out for people:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMaisie Williams: \u201cThere\u2019s this split with Arya between trying to be who she wants to be \u2014 getting back to that naivet\u00e9 and innocence with her family \u2014 and her unfinished business.\u201d \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Arya will have to grapple with who she has become, her desire for revenge, her list and trying to reconcile that with being back home with her family and trying to get back to her season 1 self. I also suspect the Faceless Men will make a come back in her storyline because that arc is not concluded and cults tend to stalk ex-members through most of their lives. I think she will be pretty involved in the White Walker war but I\u2019m not sure what her story will be post that or how all of the elements in her plot will play out in relationship to the larger aspects of the story.\u00a0</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve rambled quite a bit in this answer but I hope there\u2019s some value in what I\u2019ve said. :)</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

Do you see this having a role in her arc in s8? A lot of her \u201cunreliable\u201d POV set the tone for these characters and the GAs perception. Jon\u2019s a hero. Sansa\u2019s a useless female. And Dany\u2019s her destined bff because she loves dragons and is an atypical female.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>You pose a series of very interesting but quite hard to answer questions. I say it\u2019s hard to answer because firstly we need to take into account the differences between book Arya and show Arya, as well as the Ds inability to write positive female relationships. On top of that, there\u2019s also the trauma that both Sansa and Arya have experienced, the issues they had as children, their very different personalities and ultimately what their story arcs are, or rather what we can theorize their endgame arcs will be.\u00a0</p><p>So the subject of Arya and Sansa\u2019s relationship becomes hard to tackle. Particularly since we tend to pick sides, independent of where in the fandom we are placed. Arya stans will always take Arya\u2019s side in everything, even when Arya behaves in truly terrifying ways (like threatening to cut off her sister\u2019s face) and Sansa and Jonsa stans are somewhat reluctant to look at things from Arya\u2019s perspective (while not excusing her behavior) and talk about how Sansa could have potentially handled things better in relation to her sister in season 7 because for one Sansa is always the one that gets the short end of the stick in the fandom when it comes to her conflicts with Arya (despite the fact that most of them are not her fault) and also because, again and I can\u2019t stress this enough, show Arya went as far as to threaten to cut off her face.\u00a0</p><p>I think when it comes to show Arya, she\u2019s learned to see the worst in people, period. Because the Ds were so focused in season 7 to screw with the Starks, we didn\u2019t get to see what the fallout of Arya\u2019s stint with the Faceless Men really was in terms of her state of mind. But that must have left some pretty deep scars because Arya went there in good faith, on the word of Jaqen H'ghar and ended up joining a death cult instead. Also the waif must have really shattered what little trust she had left.\u00a0</p><p>So by the time she reunites with Sansa, Arya is very much not in a good place emotionally. She\u2019s just come from committing mass murder, after all.\u00a0</p><p>Talking about the Winterfell plot in season 7 is difficult because it\u2019s such a cesspool of bad writing and unearned twists and poor character development, that trying to taking it seriously and actually analyze the characters\u2019 decision making process within that context feels almost not worthwhile.\u00a0</p><p>However, I will say that during Sansa and Arya first meeting in the crypts, there are a few things that become clear:\u00a0</p><p>Arya is dissapointed that Jon is not there since he\u2019s the only reason why she decided to come home. However, she isn\u2019t cruel to Sansa, just apprehensive. Sansa for her part is excited to have Arya back home but she\u2019s pretty awkward around her as well because she doesn\u2019t quite know how to behave. However, once the ice is broken so to speak and they hug for the second time, it\u2019s actually a very sweet moment between the two of them. Which is why the rest of the plot pisses me off as much as it does.\u00a0</p><p>In season 7 we get another clue that Sansa does know Arya as well as accept her for who she is, when she goes to the crypts knowing that Arya would be there. This is after talking to Brienne in season 6 and smiling at the thought of Arya not being dressed like a lady.\u00a0\u201cNo, she wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Sansa says. So it\u2019s actually inaccurate to say that Sansa doesn\u2019t value Arya for who she is.</p><p>Unfortunately the same can\u2019t be said of Arya who from the first moment she meets Sansa in the crypts begins to be dismissive of her. She\u2019s slightly incredulous that Jon left Sansa in charge and things only escalate from there.\u00a0</p><p>Both these girls have huge trust issues that impede them from treating each other like family. It becomes even more apparent that the only reason why Jon and Sansa\u2019s reunion went as smoothly as it did was because of Jon\u2019s willingness to welcome Sansa with open arms and no apprehension.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa tries to do the same with Arya but she doesn\u2019t quite manage to go all the way.\u00a0\u00a0Arya for her part is slightly emotionally cut-off even in the beginning of season 7, which is why probably people feel she was acting OOC. I\u2019m not sure she was but rather that we are not given the proper context as to what has made Arya even more emotionally distant. I\u2019m going to assume that the Faceless Men and the killing of the Freys had an impact on her state of mind but I would have appreciated the writers actually doing the work to present that as opposed to just filming LF smirking in dark corners every other episode.\u00a0</p><p>Then everything is, of course, derailed by Littlefinger so we never see the slow progression of Sansa and Arya\u2019s relationship. But I will say that in order for them to have a real sibling relationship, two things need to happen in season 8:\u00a0</p><p>Arya needs to let go of her internalized misogyny and treat Sansa with respect. Not more digs at her liking to knit or enjoying pretty dresses. No more assumptions that Sansa took the Lord\u2019s Chamber because she\u2019s always liked\u00a0\u201cnice things\u201d. I mean, she didn\u2019t even know what the context of that was. She didn\u2019t know that Jon had the Lord\u2019s Chamber prepared for Sansa and that she didn\u2019t take it for herself. She doesn\u2019t know the full extent of Jon and Sansa\u2019s relationship. And she doesn\u2019t know any of those things because she doesn\u2019t ask. She just jumps to conclusions. She needs to actually give Sansa the benefit of the doubt and stop attacking her at the slightest provocation.\u00a0</p><p>For Sansa\u2019s part, she needs to lower her guard and let Arya in more. Be more vulnerable around her. She\u2019s never going to win the stone face, tough as nails competition with Arya. She\u2019s much better at it than Sansa. The only way she can have a relationship with Arya is if she opens up and let\u2019s Arya get to know her better. She also needs to accept that not everyone is going to be as patient or understanding with her as Jon is. I\u2019m not blaming Sansa for her traumas but looking from the outside, it\u2019s actually pretty hard to deal and relate to someone who is actively trying to keep everyone at arms length and Arya simply does not have the kind of personality that can deal with that in the optimum way.\u00a0</p><p>What I\u2019m trying to say is that Arya and Sansa\u2019s relationship is a work in progress. And I do hope that at some point they will end up being the true sisters that they\u2019re supposed to be. They\u2019ve both been through a lot and they need each other. However, for that to happen they would both need to put in the work and, most importantly, the Ds would have to be capable of writing it. While I think the first can be achieved, I\u2019m not that sure the second is since the Ds prioritize everything in this story above female relationships.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nArya also still holds on to some of her earlier childhood perceptions- about Jon (he can do no wrong) about Sansa (she is all about herself) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I can\u2019t really fault Arya for idealizing Jon. He was her closest sibling, her big brother, her protector and number one fan. The thought of Jon kept Arya going through some pretty horrible experiences so I don\u2019t think she will ever care about Sansa the way she cares about Jon. When push comes to shove, she\u2019ll always take Jon\u2019s side over Sansa\u2019s, unless Jon does something truly inexcusable, like let\u2019s say give away Arya\u2019s childhood home to a tyrant with nukes \u2026 or something like that \u2026 just an example, mind you.\u00a0</p><p>So it\u2019s really on Jon, particularly if Jonsa happens, to try to keep these relationships separate and make sure that Sansa doesn\u2019t feel cornered, so to speak. It\u2019s not really fair to him to have to play referee that but that\u2019s what faux-incest does. It inevitably complicates family relationships. lol\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>according to the clip about Dragons (in awe about stories she\u2019s heard)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Again, I\u2019m not sure this is quite odd. Dragons ARE fascinating creatures. They\u2019re huge, they fly, they breathe fire. It\u2019s normal to be in awe of them at first so I don\u2019t see anything wrong with Arya being interested in them. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to continue being in awe of them once she realizes the damage they can cause.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nDany\u2019s her destined bff because she loves dragons and is an atypical female.<br></p></blockquote><p>This is a fandom invention made by people that hate Sansa and Jonsa.

                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>\n\nTo follow up on my ask. Arya also still holds on to some of her earlier childhood perceptions- about Jon (he can do no wrong) about Sansa (she is all about herself) and according to the clip about Dragons (in awe about stories she&rsquo;s heard). Do you see this having a role in her arc in s8? A lot of her &ldquo;unreliable&rdquo; POV set the tone for these characters and the GAs perception. Jon&rsquo;s a hero. Sansa&rsquo;s a useless female. And Dany&rsquo;s her destined bff because she loves dragons and is an atypical female.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>You pose a series of very interesting but quite hard to answer questions. I say it&rsquo;s hard to answer because firstly we need to take into account the differences between book Arya and show Arya, as well as the Ds inability to write positive female relationships. On top of that, there&rsquo;s also the trauma that both Sansa and Arya have experienced, the issues they had as children, their very different personalities and ultimately what their story arcs are, or rather what we can theorize their endgame arcs will be.&nbsp;</p><p>So the subject of Arya and Sansa&rsquo;s relationship becomes hard to tackle. Particularly since we tend to pick sides, independent of where in the fandom we are placed. Arya stans will always take Arya&rsquo;s side in everything, even when Arya behaves in truly terrifying ways (like threatening to cut off her sister&rsquo;s face) and Sansa and Jonsa stans are somewhat reluctant to look at things from Arya&rsquo;s perspective (while not excusing her behavior) and talk about how Sansa could have potentially handled things better in relation to her sister in season 7 because for one Sansa is always the one that gets the short end of the stick in the fandom when it comes to her conflicts with Arya (despite the fact that most of them are not her fault) and also because, again and I can&rsquo;t stress this enough, show Arya went as far as to threaten to cut off her face.&nbsp;</p><p>I think when it comes to show Arya, she&rsquo;s learned to see the worst in people, period. Because the Ds were so focused in season 7 to screw with the Starks, we didn&rsquo;t get to see what the fallout of Arya&rsquo;s stint with the Faceless Men really was in terms of her state of mind. But that must have left some pretty deep scars because Arya went there in good faith, on the word of Jaqen H'ghar and ended up joining a death cult instead. Also the waif must have really shattered what little trust she had left.&nbsp;</p><p>So by the time she reunites with Sansa, Arya is very much not in a good place emotionally. She&rsquo;s just come from committing mass murder, after all.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about the Winterfell plot in season 7 is difficult because it&rsquo;s such a cesspool of bad writing and unearned twists and poor character development, that trying to taking it seriously and actually analyze the characters&rsquo; decision making process within that context feels almost not worthwhile.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I will say that during Sansa and Arya first meeting in the crypts, there are a few things that become clear:&nbsp;</p><p>Arya is dissapointed that Jon is not there since he&rsquo;s the only reason why she decided to come home. However, she isn&rsquo;t cruel to Sansa, just apprehensive. Sansa for her part is excited to have Arya back home but she&rsquo;s pretty awkward around her as well because she doesn&rsquo;t quite know how to behave. However, once the ice is broken so to speak and they hug for the second time, it&rsquo;s actually a very sweet moment between the two of them. Which is why the rest of the plot pisses me off as much as it does.&nbsp;</p><p>In season 7 we get another clue that Sansa does know Arya as well as accept her for who she is, when she goes to the crypts knowing that Arya would be there. This is after talking to Brienne in season 6 and smiling at the thought of Arya not being dressed like a lady.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Sansa says. So it&rsquo;s actually inaccurate to say that Sansa doesn&rsquo;t value Arya for who she is.</p><p>Unfortunately the same can&rsquo;t be said of Arya who from the first moment she meets Sansa in the crypts begins to be dismissive of her. She&rsquo;s slightly incredulous that Jon left Sansa in charge and things only escalate from there.&nbsp;</p><p>Both these girls have huge trust issues that impede them from treating each other like family. It becomes even more apparent that the only reason why Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s reunion went as smoothly as it did was because of Jon&rsquo;s willingness to welcome Sansa with open arms and no apprehension.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa tries to do the same with Arya but she doesn&rsquo;t quite manage to go all the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arya for her part is slightly emotionally cut-off even in the beginning of season 7, which is why probably people feel she was acting OOC. I&rsquo;m not sure she was but rather that we are not given the proper context as to what has made Arya even more emotionally distant. I&rsquo;m going to assume that the Faceless Men and the killing of the Freys had an impact on her state of mind but I would have appreciated the writers actually doing the work to present that as opposed to just filming LF smirking in dark corners every other episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Then everything is, of course, derailed by Littlefinger so we never see the slow progression of Sansa and Arya&rsquo;s relationship. But I will say that in order for them to have a real sibling relationship, two things need to happen in season 8:&nbsp;</p><p>Arya needs to let go of her internalized misogyny and treat Sansa with respect. Not more digs at her liking to knit or enjoying pretty dresses. No more assumptions that Sansa took the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber because she&rsquo;s always liked&nbsp;&ldquo;nice things&rdquo;. I mean, she didn&rsquo;t even know what the context of that was. She didn&rsquo;t know that Jon had the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber prepared for Sansa and that she didn&rsquo;t take it for herself. She doesn&rsquo;t know the full extent of Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s relationship. And she doesn&rsquo;t know any of those things because she doesn&rsquo;t ask. She just jumps to conclusions. She needs to actually give Sansa the benefit of the doubt and stop attacking her at the slightest provocation.&nbsp;</p><p>For Sansa&rsquo;s part, she needs to lower her guard and let Arya in more. Be more vulnerable around her. She&rsquo;s never going to win the stone face, tough as nails competition with Arya. She&rsquo;s much better at it than Sansa. The only way she can have a relationship with Arya is if she opens up and let&rsquo;s Arya get to know her better. She also needs to accept that not everyone is going to be as patient or understanding with her as Jon is. I&rsquo;m not blaming Sansa for her traumas but looking from the outside, it&rsquo;s actually pretty hard to deal and relate to someone who is actively trying to keep everyone at arms length and Arya simply does not have the kind of personality that can deal with that in the optimum way.&nbsp;</p><p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that Arya and Sansa&rsquo;s relationship is a work in progress. And I do hope that at some point they will end up being the true sisters that they&rsquo;re supposed to be. They&rsquo;ve both been through a lot and they need each other. However, for that to happen they would both need to put in the work and, most importantly, the Ds would have to be capable of writing it. While I think the first can be achieved, I&rsquo;m not that sure the second is since the Ds prioritize everything in this story above female relationships.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nArya also still holds on to some of her earlier childhood perceptions- about Jon (he can do no wrong) about Sansa (she is all about herself) \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>I can&rsquo;t really fault Arya for idealizing Jon. He was her closest sibling, her big brother, her protector and number one fan. The thought of Jon kept Arya going through some pretty horrible experiences so I don&rsquo;t think she will ever care about Sansa the way she cares about Jon. When push comes to shove, she&rsquo;ll always take Jon&rsquo;s side over Sansa&rsquo;s, unless Jon does something truly inexcusable, like let&rsquo;s say give away Arya&rsquo;s childhood home to a tyrant with nukes &hellip; or something like that &hellip; just an example, mind you.&nbsp;</p><p>So it&rsquo;s really on Jon, particularly if Jonsa happens, to try to keep these relationships separate and make sure that Sansa doesn&rsquo;t feel cornered, so to speak. It&rsquo;s not really fair to him to have to play referee that but that&rsquo;s what faux-incest does. It inevitably complicates family relationships. lol&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>according to the clip about Dragons (in awe about stories she&rsquo;s heard)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Again, I&rsquo;m not sure this is quite odd. Dragons ARE fascinating creatures. They&rsquo;re huge, they fly, they breathe fire. It&rsquo;s normal to be in awe of them at first so I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with Arya being interested in them. That doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s going to continue being in awe of them once she realizes the damage they can cause.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nDany&rsquo;s her destined bff because she loves dragons and is an atypical female.<br /></p></blockquote><p>This is a fandom invention made by people that hate Sansa and Jonsa. It has nothing to do with Arya&rsquo;s storyline. Arya stans simply want Arya to continue to hate Sansa because that validates their own hatred of her and D*ny stans want Arya to become D*ny&rsquo;s handmaiden because she&rsquo;s Jon&rsquo;s favorite sister and, as such, her stamp of approval means Jon is going to continue to be D*ny&rsquo;s lover. It&rsquo;s insulting to Arya because she&rsquo;s more than a shoulder to cry on for D*ny and it&rsquo;s insulting to Jon because he&rsquo;s a grown ass man who shouldn&rsquo;t need his little sister to approve of the woman he wants to be in a relationship with.&nbsp;</p><p>But the problem with D*ny&rsquo;s fandom is that it&rsquo;s essentially a black hole where every other character is sucked of life and energy in order to feed the &ldquo;D*ny is a godess who deserves for everyone to worship at her feet&rdquo; mindset.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as Arya&rsquo;s arc in season 8, I think Maisie really laid it out for people:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMaisie Williams: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this split with Arya between trying to be who she wants to be &mdash; getting back to that naivet&eacute; and innocence with her family &mdash; and her unfinished business.&rdquo; \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Arya will have to grapple with who she has become, her desire for revenge, her list and trying to reconcile that with being back home with her family and trying to get back to her season 1 self.
