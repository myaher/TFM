        "body": "<h2><i><b>WHY I LOVE SANSA STARK</b></i> - an essay by me</h2><p>People always say she kept making bad decisions after another. But what do they mean by this? Because she loved Joffrey? Sansa was a noble girl, a first born daughter of a lord, is it her fault or a bad decision to believe in the tales of courtly love and chivalry that her parents wanted her to believe? Are we to blame children for believing the things that their parents told them to believe? The expectations of her in life was to one day marry a high lord or prince and be the perfect wife and make little lords or ladies or princes or princesses. Was it a wrong thing then for Sansa to fall for Joffrey? Every little girl goes through a time in their lives of wanting to be a princess, there&rsquo;s a reason why in the real world that Disney Princesses merchandising is never lacking, because that dream is out there and little girls still believe in it - hell, when Prince William was a teenager, there was that whole wave of William-mania of people desiring to be the future Princess/Queen. Sansa&rsquo;s desires and beliefs in marrying a handsome prince is literally no different than Bran&rsquo;s own dreams of being a knight in the Kingsguard. They all had their dreams and Sansa&rsquo;s dream was actually within reach.</p><p>If you are to blame Sansa for &ldquo;siding&rdquo; with Joffrey, let&rsquo;s not forget that Sansa never actually did side with Joffrey. <i>She instead tried to remain neutral.</i> Siding with Joffrey would be her saying that yes it was Arya&rsquo;s fault and Joffrey did nothing wrong. But that&rsquo;s not what Sansa did. She didn&rsquo;t want to betray her sister, she didn&rsquo;t want to betray her family. So instead Sansa said she didn&rsquo;t remember. By saying she didn&rsquo;t remember, she wouldn&rsquo;t be forced to take anyone&rsquo;s side and thereby removing her voice from anything that may mean punishment for her sister or vice versa. And here is something to remember - even the honorable Ned Stark said <i>&ldquo;Sansa will be married to Joffrey one day, she cannot betray him, she must take his side even when he&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</i> - this came from Ned Stark. Ned even believed that Sansa&rsquo;s duty to Joffrey outweighed any sense of right or wrong, just think about this, if this is what Ned even believes, then how is it Sansa&rsquo;s fault for what she believes she should do? And again, let&rsquo;s not forget, Sansa actually didn&rsquo;t side with Joffrey, she didn&rsquo;t say what he wanted her to say - Sansa, at age 13, despite the fact that even her father believed it was her duty to side with Joffrey, <b>CHOSE</b> to instead remain neutral and lie that she didn&rsquo;t see anything, because she didn&rsquo;t want to betray her sister and her family. She did it for her family yet it was her direwolf that was killed by her own father. Think about how traumatizing that must be for a young girl. Imagine if your father killed your dog when you were 13 years old. Would you not be upset?</p><p>And Ned&rsquo;s death was hardly Sansa&rsquo;s fault. It was Ned&rsquo;s own fault for blurting out the truth. It was Sansa in fact who begged on her knees in public, in humiliating circumstances, for them to give her father mercy. It was Sansa who did the best she could and what she was told so that her father would remain alive. If Joffrey hadn&rsquo;t decided to go off the playbook, Ned would have been fine and off to the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Sansa did everything she was suppose to do and could have done. She humiliated herself for her father&rsquo;s sake. She was on her knees for her father&rsquo;s sake. And when they went to take her father&rsquo;s head, if Sansa hadn&rsquo;t been held back, she would have run up to the executioner to protect her father. <i><b>She would have died for her father.</b></i></p><p>People bring up the Hound offering to rescue her - but why would Sansa accept? She didn&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;d be caught if they ran. What if they were killed in the middle of the battle? For all Sansa knew - if she ran away with him and they got caught, her life would be over, but if she stayed and Stannis won, then she would be free. So why risk it? And even if Stannis failed to win, all Sansa would be doing is return to the life she already knew how to endure and deal with. So why risk a new element when she can simply settle for the devil she already knew? Sansa&rsquo;s choice isn&rsquo;t a bad decision - it was a calculated decision to make the safest choice with the information she had.</p><p>People bring up Tyrion - yes he was nice to her, but so what? Why would Sansa trust him or even like him? He&rsquo;s a Lannister, he will always be a member of the family that killed her own. How could she ever be okay with him? Think about this, if someone from a family that murdered your family members, would you simply listen to them and accept them just because they were nice? Or would you forever be distrustful of them? Sansa was as kind as she could be expected of her as a lady, and let&rsquo;s not forget that at Joffrey&rsquo;s wedding, she picked up the cup and handed it to him, despite the fact that she could have been punished for publicly helping him. And let&rsquo;s not forget what Tyrion said,<i> &ldquo;Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.&rdquo;</i> - and <b>SHE DID SURVIVE</b>. Tyrion even back then saw something in Sansa that few people, and few audience members ever did. He recognized that she was doing the best she could.</p><p>People bring up Theon - yes he pushed Myranda and helped rescue Sansa - but let&rsquo;s not forget what happened to get there - <i><b>Sansa was in the process of trying to run away herself</b></i>. She didn&rsquo;t stay locked up in her room, she got out and was trying to run when Myranda and Theon caught up to her. She didn&rsquo;t wait for someone to rescue her, she didn&rsquo;t wait for someone to free her, she decided to do it herself. If no one was coming, then she was going to do it herself. Theon, let&rsquo;s not forget again, only really came back to being Theon, because of Sansa&rsquo;s presence. If anything, she was just as much help to Theon coming back to himself as he was to killing Myranda so they could escape. And while Sansa&rsquo;s solo escape attempt was stopped by Myranda, let&rsquo;s remember that when faced with death, Sansa stood strong with her head held high, she was going to face death with grace and dignity befitting of a Stark.</p><p>People bring up the Tyrells - yet they seem to have forgotten that Sansa literally did all the right things? It was the Tyrells themselves who got outplayed by the Lannisters, so I don&rsquo;t see how this is a mark down against Sansa, if anything, it should be a mark down against the Tyrells. </p><p>People bring up Brienne - again they seem to have forgotten that when Sansa and Brienne first met, Sansa knew nothing about her. If you do not blame Arya for telling Brienne off because she didn&rsquo;t trust Brienne, then why is it that Sansa has now made a bad decision to not trust Brienne for the same reasons that Arya didn&rsquo;t trust Brienne? While we the audience knows Brienne, let&rsquo;s not forget that Brienne is a stranger to Sansa as she was to Arya. Again, why should Sansa choose to go with a stranger she doesn&rsquo;t know and a squire that she knows serves the Lannisters, than stay with Littlefinger, someone whom she does at least know and is at the very least interested in keeping her alive for whatever reasons? Littlefinger is the devil she already knew, Brienne is a dangerous new element she doesn&rsquo;t know. Again, Sansa went with the safest choice she could make in that moment with the information she&rsquo;s had.</p><p>People bring up Littlefinger - yes he rescued her and helped her and she trusted him to an extent, but how does any of that diminish Sansa? If you blame her for trusting Littlefinger, did you blame Ned and Catelyn too for trusting Littlefinger? Let&rsquo;s not forget here, Littlefinger outplayed almost every single person in this &ldquo;game&rdquo;, so if Sansa made mistakes with him, then how is she any worse at it than any other person that Littlefinger as outplayed, including the Lannisters and even Varys? If anything, Sansa remained the most observant of anyone dealing with Littlefinger and played to what he wanted her to be. She was soft and demure, she let him get away with kissing her a few times, she lets him have feelings for her, and she used all of that to play with the devil she knew than dealing with devils she didn&rsquo;t. She lied in the Vale for him because she knew how to deal with him better than she knew how to deal with other lords and ladies, she used his feelings for her to get the soldiers from the Vale into the battle and save the day. Yet all the while, she never fully trusted him - do not forget, it was Sansa who said to Bran <i>&ldquo;Littlefinger is not a generous man, he wouldn&rsquo;t give you anything unless he wanted something in return.&rdquo; </i>- she&rsquo;s not stupid, she knows that he is always plotting for something and wants something, and she&rsquo;s trying to keep a balance on that.</p><p>People bring up Sansa going to Bran to figure out what&rsquo;s going on - but how does that diminish Sansa? It wasn&rsquo;t Bran who went to her, <b>SHE SOUGHT HIM OUT</b> because she realized that her suspicions and feelings can be corroborated and confirmed by an asset that she has right in this very castle. If anything, that shows her smarts in realizing to confirm before taking any action. Sansa had her suspicions, yet instead of acting rashly on those decisions, Sansa realizes that there is someone that she can go to confirm her feelings. That&rsquo;s not a sign of bad decision making, that is a sign of someone using their brain and utilizing every resource they have at their disposal. And let&rsquo;s not forget here, many of the information that Bran gave to Sansa would have been information that she never would have been able to figure out anyways, that <i><b>no person</b></i> would have been able to figure out unless you happened to be an omnipotent viewer to events like Bran is. So just because Sansa didn&rsquo;t know all those things doesn&rsquo;t somehow diminish her smarts, even Arya would have never figured all of it out either. Sansa&rsquo;s act of going to Bran to confirm her feelings only proves that she is smart and clever and engages in rational thinking before she acts on anything. That is not her making a bad decision, that is her in fact being very smart.</p><p>Why do I love Sansa Stark? Because her story is the most realistic, because her story is what most of us would be if we were in that Game of Thrones world. We wouldn&rsquo;t have some magical destiny or learn some assassin skills, that&rsquo;s a power/hero fantasy. We would be like Sansa, just someone trying to survive and deal with obstacles along the way. Some might find that story boring, but I do not, I relate to Sansa because I too was once a young girl with dreams of fairy tales that the real life decided to smash to pieces because adult life isn&rsquo;t that perfect fantasy that I had dreamed of having. Sansa&rsquo;s story is everyone&rsquo;s story of growing up, of learning about life and all its struggles, of enduring pain and suffering and trauma yet still trying to hold onto one&rsquo;s identity and beliefs. It may not be all powerful and exciting and sword swinging action, <i><b>but it is a real story</b></i>.</p><p>Sansa Stark could have allowed suffering to make her evil, mad, or cruel, yet she doesn&rsquo;t. Despite at the age of 13 living her life surrounded by her enemies and having to perform under horrific abuse, she still remains true to herself and her beliefs, she holds her head high with dignity and grace. Strength isn&rsquo;t just how badass you can be physically or you know how to swing a sword, true strength is mental strength, and <b>Sansa&rsquo;s endurance and perseverance through every trauma she has been through is something that is not appreciated enough</b>. </p><p>I ask everyone this, imagine yourself at 13 years old, imagine you knew nothing of what is going on in this show and you lived in her shoes, would you truly have been able to survive like she did? Would you have been able to remain yourself without letting the trauma destroy you? Would you have been able to endure and keep up a smile while living in the house of a family that murdered your own and kidnapped you and held you hostage? Would have you been able to survive and not lose yourself?</p><p>I doubt many of us would have been able to survive as she did.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t think so, then I recommend you play the Game of Thrones Telltale game, if nothing else, that might show you just how difficult decision making can be in that world and have you appreciate what Sansa at 13 years of age was having to do in order to survive. <i><b>It&rsquo;s easy to judge her decisions as an omnipotent viewer who is seeing everything, but it&rsquo;s not so easy when you are in her shoes.</b></i></p>",

            "comment": "<p><h2><i><b>WHY I LOVE SANSA STARK</b></i> - an essay by me</h2><p>People always say she kept making bad decisions after another. But what do they mean by this? Because she loved Joffrey? Sansa was a noble girl, a first born daughter of a lord, is it her fault or a bad decision to believe in the tales of courtly love and chivalry that her parents wanted her to believe? Are we to blame children for believing the things that their parents told them to believe? The expectations of her in life was to one day marry a high lord or prince and be the perfect wife and make little lords or ladies or princes or princesses. Was it a wrong thing then for Sansa to fall for Joffrey? Every little girl goes through a time in their lives of wanting to be a princess, there\u2019s a reason why in the real world that Disney Princesses merchandising is never lacking, because that dream is out there and little girls still believe in it - hell, when Prince William was a teenager, there was that whole wave of William-mania of people desiring to be the future Princess/Queen. Sansa\u2019s desires and beliefs in marrying a handsome prince is literally no different than Bran\u2019s own dreams of being a knight in the Kingsguard. They all had their dreams and Sansa\u2019s dream was actually within reach.</p><p>If you are to blame Sansa for \u201csiding\u201d with Joffrey, let\u2019s not forget that Sansa never actually did side with Joffrey. <i>She instead tried to remain neutral.</i> Siding with Joffrey would be her saying that yes it was Arya\u2019s fault and Joffrey did nothing wrong. But that\u2019s not what Sansa did. She didn\u2019t want to betray her sister, she didn\u2019t want to betray her family. So instead Sansa said she didn\u2019t remember. By saying she didn\u2019t remember, she wouldn\u2019t be forced to take anyone\u2019s side and thereby removing her voice from anything that may mean punishment for her sister or vice versa. And here is something to remember - even the honorable Ned Stark said <i>\u201cSansa will be married to Joffrey one day, she cannot betray him, she must take his side even when he\u2019s wrong.\u201d</i> - this came from Ned Stark. Ned even believed that Sansa\u2019s duty to Joffrey outweighed any sense of right or wrong, just think about this, if this is what Ned even believes, then how is it Sansa\u2019s fault for what she believes she should do? And again, let\u2019s not forget, Sansa actually didn\u2019t side with Joffrey, she didn\u2019t say what he wanted her to say - Sansa, at age 13, despite the fact that even her father believed it was her duty to side with Joffrey, <b>CHOSE</b> to instead remain neutral and lie that she didn\u2019t see anything, because she didn\u2019t want to betray her sister and her family. She did it for her family yet it was her direwolf that was killed by her own father. Think about how traumatizing that must be for a young girl. Imagine if your father killed your dog when you were 13 years old. Would you not be upset?</p><p>And Ned\u2019s death was hardly Sansa\u2019s fault. It was Ned\u2019s own fault for blurting out the truth. It was Sansa in fact who begged on her knees in public, in humiliating circumstances, for them to give her father mercy. It was Sansa who did the best she could and what she was told so that her father would remain alive. If Joffrey hadn\u2019t decided to go off the playbook, Ned would have been fine and off to the Night\u2019s Watch. Sansa did everything she was suppose to do and could have done. She humiliated herself for her father\u2019s sake. She was on her knees for her father\u2019s sake. And when they went to take her father\u2019s head, if Sansa hadn\u2019t been held back, she would have run up to the executioner to protect her father. <i><b>She would have died for her father.</b></i></p><p>People bring up the Hound offering to rescue her - but why would Sansa accept? She didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d be caught if they ran. What if they were killed in the middle of the battle? For all Sansa knew - if she ran away with him and they got caught, her life would be over, but if she stayed and Stannis won, then she would be free. So why risk it? And even if Stannis failed to win, all Sansa would be doing is return to the life she already knew how to endure and deal with. So why risk a new element when she can simply settle for the devil she already knew? Sansa\u2019s choice isn\u2019t a bad decision - it was a calculated decision to make the safest choice with the information she had.</p><p>People bring up Tyrion - yes he was nice to her, but so what? Why would Sansa trust him or even like him? He\u2019s a Lannister, he will always be a member of the family that killed her own. How could she ever be okay with him? Think about this, if someone from a family that murdered your family members, would you simply listen to them and accept them just because they were nice? Or would you forever be distrustful of them? Sansa was as kind as she could be expected of her as a lady, and let\u2019s not forget that at Joffrey\u2019s wedding, she picked up the cup and handed it to him, despite the fact that she could have been punished for publicly helping him. And let\u2019s not forget what Tyrion said,<i> \u201cLady Stark, you may survive us yet.\u201d</i> - and <b>SHE DID SURVIVE</b>. Tyrion even back then saw something in Sansa that few people, and few audience members ever did. He recognized that she was doing the best she could.</p><p>People bring up Theon - yes he pushed Myranda and helped rescue Sansa - but let\u2019s not forget what happened to get there - <i><b>Sansa was in the process of trying to run away herself</b></i>. She didn\u2019t stay locked up in her room, she got out and was trying to run when Myranda and Theon caught up to her. She didn\u2019t wait for someone to rescue her, she didn\u2019t wait for someone to free her, she decided to do it herself. If no one was coming, then she was going to do it herself. Theon, let\u2019s not forget again, only really came back to being Theon, because of Sansa\u2019s presence. If anything, she was just as much help to Theon coming back to himself as he was to killing Myranda so they could escape. And while Sansa\u2019s solo escape attempt was stopped by Myranda, let\u2019s remember that when faced with death, Sansa stood strong with her head held high, she was going to face death with grace and dignity befitting of a Stark.</p><p>People bring up the Tyrells - yet they seem to have forgotten that Sansa literally did all the right things?

If you do not blame Arya for telling Brienne off because she didn\u2019t trust Brienne, then why is it that Sansa has now made a bad decision to not trust Brienne for the same reasons that Arya didn\u2019t trust Brienne? While we the audience knows Brienne, let\u2019s not forget that Brienne is a stranger to Sansa as she was to Arya. Again, why should Sansa choose to go with a stranger she doesn\u2019t know and a squire that she knows serves the Lannisters, than stay with Littlefinger, someone whom she does at least know and is at the very least interested in keeping her alive for whatever reasons? Littlefinger is the devil she already knew, Brienne is a dangerous new element she doesn\u2019t know. Again, Sansa went with the safest choice she could make in that moment with the information she\u2019s had.</p><p>People bring up Littlefinger - yes he rescued her and helped her and she trusted him to an extent, but how does any of that diminish Sansa? If you blame her for trusting Littlefinger, did you blame Ned and Catelyn too for trusting Littlefinger? Let\u2019s not forget here, Littlefinger outplayed almost every single person in this \u201cgame\u201d, so if Sansa made mistakes with him, then how is she any worse at it than any other person that Littlefinger as outplayed, including the Lannisters and even Varys?

Because she loved Joffrey? Sansa was a noble girl, a first born daughter of a lord, is it her fault or a bad decision to believe in the tales of courtly love and chivalry that her parents wanted her to believe? Are we to blame children for believing the things that their parents told them to believe?

But that\u2019s not what Sansa did. She didn\u2019t want to betray her sister, she didn\u2019t want to betray her family. So instead Sansa said she didn\u2019t remember. By saying she didn\u2019t remember, she wouldn\u2019t be forced to take anyone\u2019s side and thereby removing her voice from anything that may mean punishment for her sister or vice versa. And here is something to remember - even the honorable Ned Stark said <i>\u201cSansa will be married to Joffrey one day, she cannot betray him, she must take his side even when he\u2019s wrong.\u201d</i> - this came from Ned Stark. Ned even believed that Sansa\u2019s duty to Joffrey outweighed any sense of right or wrong, just think about this, if this is what Ned even believes, then how is it Sansa\u2019s fault for what she believes she should do? And again, let\u2019s not forget, Sansa actually didn\u2019t side with Joffrey, she didn\u2019t say what he wanted her to say - Sansa, at age 13, despite the fact that even her father believed it was her duty to side with Joffrey, <b>CHOSE</b> to instead remain neutral and lie that she didn\u2019t see anything, because she didn\u2019t want to betray her sister and her family. She did it for her family yet it was her direwolf that was killed by her own father. Think about how traumatizing that must be for a young girl.

And even if Stannis failed to win, all Sansa would be doing is return to the life she already knew how to endure and deal with. So why risk a new element when she can simply settle for the devil she already knew? Sansa\u2019s choice isn\u2019t a bad decision - it was a calculated decision to make the safest choice with the information she had.</p><p>People bring up Tyrion - yes he was nice to her, but so what? Why would Sansa trust him or even like him? He\u2019s a Lannister, he will always be a member of the family that killed her own. How could she ever be okay with him? Think about this, if someone from a family that murdered your family members, would you simply listen to them and accept them just because they were nice? Or would you forever be distrustful of them? Sansa was as kind as she could be expected of her as a lady, and let\u2019s not forget that at Joffrey\u2019s wedding, she picked up the cup and handed it to him, despite the fact that she could have been punished for publicly helping him. And let\u2019s not forget what Tyrion said,<i> \u201cLady Stark, you may survive us yet.\u201d</i> - and <b>SHE DID SURVIVE</b>. Tyrion even back then saw something in Sansa that few people, and few audience members ever did. He recognized that she was doing the best she could.</p><p>People bring up Theon - yes he pushed Myranda and helped rescue Sansa - but let\u2019s not forget what happened to get there - <i><b>Sansa was in the process of trying to run away herself</b></i>. She didn\u2019t stay locked up in her room, she got out and was trying to run when Myranda and Theon caught up to her. She didn\u2019t wait for someone to rescue her, she didn\u2019t wait for someone to free her, she decided to do it herself. If no one was coming, then she was going to do it herself. Theon, let\u2019s not forget again, only really came back to being Theon, because of Sansa\u2019s presence. If anything, she was just as much help to Theon coming back to himself as he was to killing Myranda so they could escape. And while Sansa\u2019s solo escape attempt was stopped by Myranda, let\u2019s remember that when faced with death, Sansa stood strong with her head held high, she was going to face death with grace and dignity befitting of a Stark.</p><p>People bring up the Tyrells - yet they seem to have forgotten that Sansa literally did all the right things? It was the Tyrells themselves who got outplayed by the Lannisters, so I don\u2019t see how this is a mark down against Sansa, if anything, it should be a mark down against the Tyrells. </p><p>People bring up Brienne - again they seem to have forgotten that when Sansa and Brienne first met, Sansa knew nothing about her. If you do not blame Arya for telling Brienne off because she didn\u2019t trust Brienne, then why is it that Sansa has now made a bad decision to not trust Brienne for the same reasons that Arya didn\u2019t trust Brienne? While we the audience knows Brienne, let\u2019s not forget that Brienne is a stranger to Sansa as she was to Arya. Again, why should Sansa choose to go with a stranger she doesn\u2019t know and a squire that she knows serves the Lannisters, than stay with Littlefinger, someone whom she does at least know and is at the very least interested in keeping her alive for whatever reasons? Littlefinger is the devil she already knew, Brienne is a dangerous new element she doesn\u2019t know. Again, Sansa went with the safest choice she could make in that moment with the information she\u2019s had.</p><p>People bring up Littlefinger - yes he rescued her and helped her and she trusted him to an extent, but how does any of that diminish Sansa? If you blame her for trusting Littlefinger, did you blame Ned and Catelyn too for trusting Littlefinger? Let\u2019s not forget here, Littlefinger outplayed almost every single person in this \u201cgame\u201d, so if Sansa made mistakes with him, then how is she any worse at it than any other person that Littlefinger as outplayed, including the Lannisters and even Varys? If anything, Sansa remained the most observant of anyone dealing with Littlefinger and played to what he wanted her to be. She was soft and demure, she let him get away with kissing her a few times, she lets him have feelings for her, and she used all of that to play with the devil she knew than dealing with devils she didn\u2019t. She lied in the Vale for him because she knew how to deal with him better than she knew how to deal with other lords and ladies, she used his feelings for her to get the soldiers from the Vale into the battle and save the day. Yet all the while, she never fully trusted him - do not forget, it was Sansa who said to Bran <i>\u201cLittlefinger is not a generous man, he wouldn\u2019t give you anything unless he wanted something in return.\u201d </i>- she\u2019s not stupid, she knows that he is always plotting for something and wants something, and she\u2019s trying to keep a balance on that.</p><p>People bring up Sansa going to Bran to figure out what\u2019s going on - but how does that diminish Sansa? It wasn\u2019t Bran who went to her, <b>SHE SOUGHT HIM OUT</b> because she realized that her suspicions and feelings can be corroborated and confirmed by an asset that she has right in this very castle. If anything, that shows her smarts in realizing to confirm before taking any action. Sansa had her suspicions, yet instead of acting rashly on those decisions, Sansa realizes that there is someone that she can go to confirm her feelings. That\u2019s not a sign of bad decision making, that is a sign of someone using their brain and utilizing every resource they have at their disposal. And let\u2019s not forget here, many of the information that Bran gave to Sansa would have been information that she never would have been able to figure out anyways, that <i><b>no person</b></i> would have been able to figure out unless you happened to be an omnipotent viewer to events like Bran is. So just because Sansa didn\u2019t know all those things doesn\u2019t somehow diminish her smarts, even Arya would have never figured all of it out either. Sansa\u2019s act of going to Bran to confirm her feelings only proves that she is smart and clever and engages in rational thinking before she acts on anything. That is not her making a bad decision, that is her in fact being very smart.</p><p>Why do I love Sansa Stark? Because her story is the most realistic, because her story is what most of us would be if we were in that Game of Thrones world. We wouldn\u2019t have some magical destiny or learn some assassin skills, that\u2019s a power/hero fantasy. We would be like Sansa, just someone trying to survive and deal with obstacles along the way. Some might find that story boring, but I do not, I relate to Sansa because I too was once a young girl with dreams of fairy tales that the real life decided to smash to pieces because adult life isn\u2019t that perfect fantasy that I had dreamed of having. Sansa\u2019s story is everyone\u2019s story of growing up, of learning about life and all its struggles, of enduring pain and suffering and trauma yet still trying to hold onto one\u2019s identity and beliefs. It may not be all powerful and exciting and sword swinging action, <i><b>but it is a real story</b></i>.</p><p>Sansa Stark could have allowed suffering to make her evil, mad, or cruel, yet she doesn\u2019t. Despite at the age of 13 living her life surrounded by her enemies and having to perform under horrific abuse, she still remains true to herself and her beliefs, she holds her head high with dignity and grace. Strength isn\u2019t just how badass you can be physically or you know how to swing a sword, true strength is mental strength, and <b>Sansa\u2019s endurance and perseverance through every trauma she has been through is something that is not appreciated enough</b>. </p><p>I ask everyone this, imagine yourself at 13 years old, imagine you knew nothing of what is going on in this show and you lived in her shoes, would you truly have been able to survive like she did? Would you have been able to remain yourself without letting the trauma destroy you? Would you have been able to endure and keep up a smile while living in the house of a family that murdered your own and kidnapped you and held you hostage? Would have you been able to survive and not lose yourself?</p><p>I doubt many of us would have been able to survive as she did.</p><p>If you don\u2019t think so, then I recommend you play the Game of Thrones Telltale game, if nothing else, that might show you just how difficult decision making can be in that world and have you appreciate what Sansa at 13 years of age was having to do in order to survive. <i><b>It\u2019s easy to judge her decisions as an omnipotent viewer who is seeing everything, but it\u2019s not so easy when you are in her shoes.</b></i></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2><i><b>WHY I LOVE SANSA STARK</b></i> - an essay by me</h2><p>People always say she kept making bad decisions after another. But what do they mean by this? Because she loved Joffrey? Sansa was a noble girl, a first born daughter of a lord, is it her fault or a bad decision to believe in the tales of courtly love and chivalry that her parents wanted her to believe? Are we to blame children for believing the things that their parents told them to believe? The expectations of her in life was to one day marry a high lord or prince and be the perfect wife and make little lords or ladies or princes or princesses. Was it a wrong thing then for Sansa to fall for Joffrey? Every little girl goes through a time in their lives of wanting to be a princess, there&rsquo;s a reason why in the real world that Disney Princesses merchandising is never lacking, because that dream is out there and little girls still believe in it - hell, when Prince William was a teenager, there was that whole wave of William-mania of people desiring to be the future Princess/Queen. Sansa&rsquo;s desires and beliefs in marrying a handsome prince is literally no different than Bran&rsquo;s own dreams of being a knight in the Kingsguard. They all had their dreams and Sansa&rsquo;s dream was actually within reach.</p><p>If you are to blame Sansa for &ldquo;siding&rdquo; with Joffrey, let&rsquo;s not forget that Sansa never actually did side with Joffrey. <i>She instead tried to remain neutral.</i> Siding with Joffrey would be her saying that yes it was Arya&rsquo;s fault and Joffrey did nothing wrong. But that&rsquo;s not what Sansa did. She didn&rsquo;t want to betray her sister, she didn&rsquo;t want to betray her family. So instead Sansa said she didn&rsquo;t remember. By saying she didn&rsquo;t remember, she wouldn&rsquo;t be forced to take anyone&rsquo;s side and thereby removing her voice from anything that may mean punishment for her sister or vice versa. And here is something to remember - even the honorable Ned Stark said <i>&ldquo;Sansa will be married to Joffrey one day, she cannot betray him, she must take his side even when he&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</i> - this came from Ned Stark. Ned even believed that Sansa&rsquo;s duty to Joffrey outweighed any sense of right or wrong, just think about this, if this is what Ned even believes, then how is it Sansa&rsquo;s fault for what she believes she should do? And again, let&rsquo;s not forget, Sansa actually didn&rsquo;t side with Joffrey, she didn&rsquo;t say what he wanted her to say - Sansa, at age 13, despite the fact that even her father believed it was her duty to side with Joffrey, <b>CHOSE</b> to instead remain neutral and lie that she didn&rsquo;t see anything, because she didn&rsquo;t want to betray her sister and her family. She did it for her family yet it was her direwolf that was killed by her own father. Think about how traumatizing that must be for a young girl. Imagine if your father killed your dog when you were 13 years old. Would you not be upset?</p><p>And Ned&rsquo;s death was hardly Sansa&rsquo;s fault. It was Ned&rsquo;s own fault for blurting out the truth. It was Sansa in fact who begged on her knees in public, in humiliating circumstances, for them to give her father mercy. It was Sansa who did the best she could and what she was told so that her father would remain alive. If Joffrey hadn&rsquo;t decided to go off the playbook, Ned would have been fine and off to the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Sansa did everything she was suppose to do and could have done. She humiliated herself for her father&rsquo;s sake. She was on her knees for her father&rsquo;s sake. And when they went to take her father&rsquo;s head, if Sansa hadn&rsquo;t been held back, she would have run up to the executioner to protect her father. <i><b>She would have died for her father.</b></i></p><p>People bring up the Hound offering to rescue her - but why would Sansa accept? She didn&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;d be caught if they ran. What if they were killed in the middle of the battle? For all Sansa knew - if she ran away with him and they got caught, her life would be over, but if she stayed and Stannis won, then she would be free. So why risk it? And even if Stannis failed to win, all Sansa would be doing is return to the life she already knew how to endure and deal with. So why risk a new element when she can simply settle for the devil she already knew? Sansa&rsquo;s choice isn&rsquo;t a bad decision - it was a calculated decision to make the safest choice with the information she had.</p><p>People bring up Tyrion - yes he was nice to her, but so what? Why would Sansa trust him or even like him? He&rsquo;s a Lannister, he will always be a member of the family that killed her own. How could she ever be okay with him? Think about this, if someone from a family that murdered your family members, would you simply listen to them and accept them just because they were nice? Or would you forever be distrustful of them?

And let&rsquo;s not forget what Tyrion said,<i> &ldquo;Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.&rdquo;</i> - and <b>SHE DID SURVIVE</b>. Tyrion even back then saw something in Sansa that few people, and few audience members ever did. He recognized that she was doing the best she could.</p><p>People bring up Theon - yes he pushed Myranda and helped rescue Sansa - but let&rsquo;s not forget what happened to get there - <i><b>Sansa was in the process of trying to run away herself</b></i>.

Again, why should Sansa choose to go with a stranger she doesn&rsquo;t know and a squire that she knows serves the Lannisters, than stay with Littlefinger, someone whom she does at least know and is at the very least interested in keeping her alive for whatever reasons? Littlefinger is the devil she already knew, Brienne is a dangerous new element she doesn&rsquo;t know. Again, Sansa went with the safest choice she could make in that moment with the information she&rsquo;s had.</p><p>People bring up Littlefinger - yes he rescued her and helped her and she trusted him to an extent, but how does any of that diminish Sansa? If you blame her for trusting Littlefinger, did you blame Ned and Catelyn too for trusting Littlefinger?
