                "content": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about parallels between people&rsquo;s campaign 1 and campaign 2 characters.<b><br /></b></p><p>Vax and Caleb are both an exploration of depression, trauma, and mental health, but also to some extent imposter syndrome and the impact it has. Both have considered leaving not because they don&rsquo;t value the people around them, but because they don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re worthy of it. Vax once said his main contribution was opening locks, and Caleb, in addition to generally hating himself, has pointed out that it&rsquo;s not that special to be able to make dancing lights.</p><p>Vex and Jester are both about hiding negative emotions and insecurities, and to some extent the idea of abandonment - both being abandoned and abandoning others. Both are fairly extroverted characters and seem outwardly confident, but Vex was extremely insecure, especially with regards to her father, and would obsess over criticism. She also had spent much of her teens and early twenties on her own with no one to rely on but Vax, which led to her desire for a stable home and her enjoyment of wealth and fame. Jester meanwhile tends to deny her own jealousy about Fjord or her own fears of abandonment, and while she had a much more stable life than Vex, she too had to leave her home unwillingly.</p><p>Pike and Yasha are both about faith and about coming from a difficult background. Pike doesn&rsquo;t talk much about her family, but she was raised by an elderly relative rather than her parents and much of the rest of her family are scammers. However, she&rsquo;s arguably the most stable and well-adjusted member of Vox Machina, in part because of her devotion to Sarenrae. Yasha&rsquo;s relationship with her god is much more recent and unclear, but it still seems to be a centering and grounding force in her life. And similarly her background is much messier, and we still don&rsquo;t quite know how she ended up joining a tribe.</p><p>Grog and Fjord are perhaps one of the hardest comparisons, but both are highly impulsive characters whose lives were drastically changed for the better by a mentor and a near death experience - Grog by nearly dying when standing up for Wilhand, and Fjord by Vandren and his later pact. Both clearly showed the influence of these mentors and valued them a lot, and while both were impulsive, they clearly regretted elements of it (I suspect Fjord&rsquo;s going to have A LOT of regrets pretty soon regarding how he&rsquo;s treated the group).</p><p>Scanlan, Tary, and Nott are all studies in ignoring your own problems (vs. Vex and Jester who seem aware of their issues but are reluctant to reveal them to others). Scanlan and Tary covered this up with bravado and in Scanlan&rsquo;s case, drugs; Nott focuses instead on how great she believes Caleb is, and of course is a heavy drinker. And, like Vax and Caleb, they&rsquo;re an interesting study in the character&rsquo;s relationship to the group as well. Scanlan claimed that his life without Vox Machina would have been easier and simpler and leaves for a while; Tary legitimately was underpowered and inexperienced compared to the rest but latched onto the group and grew as a result; and Nott doesn&rsquo;t think she really is on par with the rest but absolutely loves how much her life has changed since joining them.</p><p>Percy, Molly, and Caduceus are all defined in some ways by their relationship to death, and serve as different depictions of how people can be perceived vs. how they are.
