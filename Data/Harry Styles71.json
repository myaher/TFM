(Y/N) had been suffering from anxiety for a long time, and it had gotten so much better when Harry had come into her life.

(Y/N) tried not to tell him, so he wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for being away. But he noticed. He might not always tell her, but he definitely noticed.</p><p>It was the first time that Harry had been gone for over a month, engaged in interviews, tv appearances, writing music and visiting friends all over the globe. (Y/N) didn\u2019t mind that he was doing all that, in fact she loved that he was so passionate for all that he was doing, but still, she missed him. And tonight, she missed him more then ever. She contemplated calling him for a few times already, but had always decided against it. <br/></p><p>Right now, she could feel herself being moments away from another panic attack, one that would be the third one today. And honestly, all she wanted to do was being with Harry. But she didn\u2019t want to worry him, she didn\u2019t want to seem unsupportive. <br/></p><p>The massive weight on her chest grew stronger and stronger until she felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe anymore, tears started to spill from her eyes to her cheeks, she started to shiver.

The only thing he could hear were her sobs. <br/></p><p>\u201cOh baby, don\u2019t cry\u201d, he said, all cheer and happiness gone from his voice.</p><p>\u201c \u2018m sorry, Harry\u201d, she said between her sobs.

Breathe in - your doing so good, baby\u201d, he said as he could hear her breathing. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Breathe in, hold it, and out.\u201d</p><p>And it helped. He calmed her down again in an instant, just like it was nothing. And maybe, she thought, he made it fade away into nothing. She could barely remember why she was so stressed out.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d, (Y/N) said a few minutes later, as her breathing returned to normal and her sobs had died down. \u201cBeen having a long night.

(Y/N) had been suffering from anxiety for a long time, and it had gotten so much better when Harry had come into her life. He just had what it took to calm her down, so panic attacks had become less and less frequent. However, when he wasn\u2019t there, it got worse. (Y/N) tried not to tell him, so he wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for being away. But he noticed. He might not always tell her, but he definitely noticed.</p><p>It was the first time that Harry had been gone for over a month, engaged in interviews, tv appearances, writing music and visiting friends all over the globe. (Y/N) didn\u2019t mind that he was doing all that, in fact she loved that he was so passionate for all that he was doing, but still, she missed him. And tonight, she missed him more then ever. She contemplated calling him for a few times already, but had always decided against it. <br></p><p>Right now, she could feel herself being moments away from another panic attack, one that would be the third one today. And honestly, all she wanted to do was being with Harry. But she didn\u2019t want to worry him, she didn\u2019t want to seem unsupportive. <br></p><p>The massive weight on her chest grew stronger and stronger until she felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe anymore, tears started to spill from her eyes to her cheeks, she started to shiver. She was a mess. So she called him. After a few rings, he picked up.</p><p>\u201c \u2018lo, darling\u201d, he greeted her happily. \u201cHow\u2019re you holding up?\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice made her forget how to form words for a moment. The only thing he could hear were her sobs. <br></p><p>\u201cOh baby, don\u2019t cry\u201d, he said, all cheer and happiness gone from his voice.</p><p>\u201c \u2018m sorry, Harry\u201d, she said between her sobs. She really didn\u2019t want to cry, she just didn\u2019t know how to stop. <br></p><p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s going to be okay, just breathe with me, okay? Breathe in, hold it, breathe out. Breathe in - your doing so good, baby\u201d, he said as he could hear her breathing. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Breathe in, hold it, and out.\u201d</p><p>And it helped. He calmed her down again in an instant, just like it was nothing. And maybe, she thought, he made it fade away into nothing. She could barely remember why she was so stressed out.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d, (Y/N) said a few minutes later, as her breathing returned to normal and her sobs had died down. \u201cBeen having a long night. I just really needed to hear your voice, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve called me earlier, love. Promise me you\u2019ll call me when you feel it start again, okay?\u201d, he asked. As he didn\u2019t hear her answer, he decided to dig a little deeper. \u201c(Y/N)? Baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026. I don\u2019t want to bother you\u201d, she whispered. <br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t bother me, (Y/N). Never. So, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a long time.<br></p><p>\u201cI- I really need you, but I don\u2019t want you to feel bad because of me. I want to support you, I really do, it\u2019s just\u2026 hard without having you here\u201d, she finally confessed, knowing that he wouldn\u2019t let it go until she told him.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too, so much\u201d, he said and she could swear that she heard his voice breaking a little. \u201c \u2018f course I feel bad for not being with you, love, but honestly, it makes it a hundred times worse when I know you won\u2019t call me when you\u2019re feeling bad. Promise me you\u2019ll call me next time? Please?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI promise.

Feedback is always appreciated!!!</p><hr><h2>Week 12</h2><p><b></b></p><p>It\u2019s been a week since you knew you\u2019re pregnant. Harry didn\u2019t let you do anything. He was a bit overprotecting. He always made sure you\u2019re sitting comfortable or having enough space. </p><p>On the other hand you had work. Even though you had almost two months until the Judges\u2019 House, but you had other tasks to do. You had check ups every week from now. It turned out you are pregnant for real. But this time you and Harry were more conscious about it. You did everything for your baby. The doctor said that because of the previous miscarriage, you should wait until week 12 to be sure of the pregnancy. The release of your albums were a bit delayed to September. So when both were out you had a little party to celebrate the success of your albums that were on top of all lists. Everyone was dying for Harry\u2019s second album since the first one came out and finally everyone got that. And now that you were a Styles too, people were really curious about especially because it was known that most of your songs are about or for Harry. </p><p>On the party you welcomed producers, bands, family and friends to celebrate together. Harry made a toast and you stood by him, but you let him talk this time. You raised your glasses of champagne and then there was a reception. Gemma approached you as you were putting the sixth vegan roll into your mouth. </p><p>\u201cHey! Congrats on the album!\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Gem!\u201d you said while chewing. </p><p>\u201cYou must be really hungry,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you leave this table since the party started. </p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I uh\u2026 haven\u2019t eaten all day,\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she lowered her voice. \u201cAnd I saw that you haven\u2019t drank any alcohol, not even your champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no particular reason, Gem. I\u2019m not feeling having alcohol tonight. And Harry drank, so I\u2019ll be driving home, we came with the Rover and I didn\u2019t want to get a cab and leave our car here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I just noticed,\u201d she smiled, but didn\u2019t force this direction of the conversation. She knew how much pain it was for you to lose the baby the last time. She was sad about it too. She really wanted Harry to be a happy father. </p><p>Later in the evening, you drove home with Harry and you told him about the conversation with Gemma. </p><p>You frequently met your fellow judges in September and October too. There were a lot of behind the scenes work and things that had to be fixed very early. You enjoyed the work because it made you not think about how far week 12 is. But it got closer and closer day by day. You were still pregnant, you knew that and it was a good sign. One night you couldn\u2019t fall asleep immediately and Harry was half asleep. </p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d he reacted immediately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling good about this pregnancy. I\u2019m still pregnant and it\u2019s week 10. I\u2019d love to think that he or she will be born.\u201d He turned around to see you and you saw his eyes even in the dark. </p><p>\u201cYou are a strong woman. We are so careful. There is a high chance that you will give birth in 30 weeks. I believe in you. You do everything you can.\u201d He kissed your cheek. </p><p>\u201cThank you for believing in me,\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, my other half, my everything. It\u2019s obvious I believe in you and I support you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do to deserve you?\u201d you chuckled. </p><p>\u201cYou do the same. You are there for me always. You care for me. You love me. You believed in me and my album when I doubted myself.\u201d He kissed the top of your hand. </p><p>\u201cI do. I do love you and believe in you:\u201d</p><p>Two weeks later you were at the doctor\u2019s waiting room with Harry. He called you in after ten minutes and you were really nervous. He did the tests and did an ultrasound. When the image loaded you started crying. Harry held your hand in both of his hands. </p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles, that\u2019s a healthy fetus that you can see there. </p><p>\u201cI can see the legs and arms,\u201d you said through the tears. Harry was tearing too. </p><p>\u201cYes, let me show you something.\u201d The doctor gently poked your belly. And you saw it, the fetus started moving a bit. You were crying again. </p><p>\u201cThe fetus is moving. At this time of the pregnancy, your fetus is closing and opening his or her fingers and curling toes. Also, the baby\u2019s about to grow organs and tissues rapidly. If you want to find out the sex of the baby, we can do an ultrasound again in two weeks, but I can say it for sure around the twentieth week. You and Harry looked at each other. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to wait with it for a while,\u201d Harry said. You haven\u2019t talked about it yet. </p><p>When you finished, you both were on cloud nine. First of all, you called your parents who were out of their minds in a good way. They sounded very excited. Then you called Anne who was just as excited as your parents. And the list went on, you called Gemma, Sara, Jeff, the 1D boys. Louis and Liam were very excited about Harry joining fatherhood. </p><p>Next week you were back on the X-Factor because you had to choose who you\u2019re gonna take to the live shows. Everyone was betting on you taking Harry as your helper. And you did. But it wasn\u2019t just him. Since you did a BBC Radio One performance with Dua Lipa, you texted sometimes and you became kind of friends. You asked her to help you too. This little group of three and the contestants of the Girls group travelled to Italy for a weekend. You rented a villa in Tuscany to stay in. </p><p>The girls were literally screaming when they saw that Harry is one of your helper, but they were happy about Dua too. The process was hard and the contestants were good. You were glad Harry and Dua were there to help you. In the end, you chose the four girls, Abby, Natalia, Rose and Aisha. </p><p>When you got back to London, in the next few days you had a lot of pre recording to do for the live shows. Even though Louis and Simon knew you were pregnant, you didn\u2019t want to share it yet with the whole world including your girls. It was time to help them to get ready for the first show. </p>",

He was a bit overprotecting. He always made sure you\u2019re sitting comfortable or having enough space. </p><p>On the other hand you had work. Even though you had almost two months until the Judges\u2019 House, but you had other tasks to do. You had check ups every week from now. It turned out you are pregnant for real. But this time you and Harry were more conscious about it. You did everything for your baby. The doctor said that because of the previous miscarriage, you should wait until week 12 to be sure of the pregnancy. The release of your albums were a bit delayed to September. So when both were out you had a little party to celebrate the success of your albums that were on top of all lists.

You were crying again. </p><p>&ldquo;The fetus is moving. At this time of the pregnancy, your fetus is closing and opening his or her fingers and curling toes. Also, the baby&rsquo;s about to grow organs and tissues rapidly. If you want to find out the sex of the baby, we can do an ultrasound again in two weeks, but I can say it for sure around the twentieth week. You and Harry looked at each other. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to wait with it for a while,&rdquo; Harry said. You haven&rsquo;t talked about it yet. </p><p>When you finished, you both were on cloud nine. First of all, you called your parents who were out of their minds in a good way. They sounded very excited. Then you called Anne who was just as excited as your parents. And the list went on, you called Gemma, Sara, Jeff, the 1D boys. Louis and Liam were very excited about Harry joining fatherhood. </p><p>Next week you were back on the X-Factor because you had to choose who you&rsquo;re gonna take to the live shows. Everyone was betting on you taking Harry as your helper. And you did. But it wasn&rsquo;t just him. Since you did a BBC Radio One performance with Dua Lipa, you texted sometimes and you became kind of friends. You asked her to help you too. This little group of three and the contestants of the Girls group travelled to Italy for a weekend. You rented a villa in Tuscany to stay in. </p><p>The girls were literally screaming when they saw that Harry is one of your helper, but they were happy about Dua too. The process was hard and the contestants were good. You were glad Harry and Dua were there to help you. In the end, you chose the four girls, Abby, Natalia, Rose and Aisha. </p><p>When you got back to London, in the next few days you had a lot of pre recording to do for the live shows. Even though Louis and Simon knew you were pregnant, you didn&rsquo;t want to share it yet with the whole world including your girls. It was time to help them to get ready for the first show. </p>",
