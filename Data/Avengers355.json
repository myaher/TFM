(Case in point: all of the school shootings in America were done by <i>white men</i>.) \u00a0Most of all, the MCU straightwashed most of its canonically queer characters in the comics, including Loki, Ayo, and Valkyrie.</p><p>It\u2019s both frustrating and saddening that despite it being 2018 already, despite it being the 21st Century, despite the MCU being around for <i>ten years </i>already, it\u2019s still too afraid to challenge the status quo that only the straight white males are the ones who are the forefront of anything and <i>everything</i>. \u00a0I\u2019m glad and relieved that at least the MCU is at least taking baby steps to dismantling that bigoted worldview, but at the same time, it has to be two-way.</p><p>The audience has to dismantle its bigoted worldview too.</p><p>I understand the heartbreak in losing the OG Avengers. \u00a0They\u2019ve become an irreplaceable part of my heart too. \u00a0But perhaps there\u2019s an important political symbolism in their handing over the reins to not only the new generation of Avengers, but to <i>women and people of color</i>. \u00a0As if it\u2019s also saying, it\u2019s about time we realise that it\u2019s not only white men who are <i>relevant. \u00a0</i>It\u2019s not only white men who have the power to change the world\u2014and that maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s these straight, white, rich, privileged men who have actually brought the world to ruins, and it\u2019s up to these new Avengers to show what real heroism is like: standing up for the marginalised and the oppressed, <i>because they were, too.</i></p><p>Because real heroes don\u2019t come from privilege.

Loki watches you with a softness in his alluring green and blue eyes, you can never make up your mind of which color they are, so you\u2019ve decided to say both, never knowing which one fits him best.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about, love?\u201d he leans back against the couch cushion, lifting his eyes from his book to chance a glance at you and your beautiful smile.<br/></p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d you hum happily, looking at him from where you lay with a big, bright grin.\u00a0\u201cI love this quote from the book.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou sound so passionate when you talk about literature, darling, your face is lighting up,\u201d he notices with a warm expression. \u201cDo you write?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger I would,\u201d you reminisce, sighing contently, smiling at the far off memories playing through your mind.\u00a0\u201cI had this little spot&hellip; in my backyard, under my favorite tree, a <i>willow </i>tree, and I would sit there&hellip;\u201d you pause to laugh lightly.\u00a0\u201cAnd just bring out my journal, scribbling outlandish fairy tales about mythical creatures and true love. I barely even knew what love was at that age&hellip; too bad all of it was destroyed in the fire, I bet reading it would have been hilarious,\u201d you laugh, but it comes out sadder than you intended.</p><p>His embrace on you tightens when he sees your frown, \u201cDon\u2019t discount yourself, love,\u201d he says, an amused tone in his words despite his reassurance.\u00a0\u201cWho knows, young (y/n) could have been the next Hemingway&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, God no, comparing me to him is an insult to his craft, I\u2019m nowhere near as talented,\u201d you shake your head with a smile.\u00a0\u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t written in so long.\u201d<br/></p><p>He shakes his head, wondering how someone as astonishing as you could think so little of yourself, \u201cWriting, my dear, is like riding a bike, once you learn, you never forget how to do it, and with practice, you get better and better,\u201d he explains, setting his book down next to him on the small table beside you two.<br/></p><p>\u201cRead the quote to me, kitten,\u201d he whispers, shifting you so that he\u2019s laying down and your laying with the back of your head against his hard, surprisingly muscular chest. His hands found your hair, playing with it lazily, desperately needing to touch you in anyway he can, even if it\u2019s not the way he truly wants.<br/></p><p>You raise your eyebrows,\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d you ask him, turning to look him in the eye, not finding any doubts or hesitance in them. Or he\u2019s just very good at hiding it.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to bore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)&hellip;\u201d he whispers, rolling his eyes with a graciously soft smile, catching you off guard.\u00a0\u201cThe next time you say something about yourself that is other than only good things, I will knock you off this couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d you scoff.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know who you\u2019re talking to, love? I am the god of tricks, I can do <i>far </i>worse if so is requested <i>or </i>deserved,\u201d he says with a slight raise of his brow, a wicked glint in his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cRequested?\u201d you can\u2019t help but grin at the insinuation.\u00a0\u201cPerhaps I should begin reading before I take you up on that offer.\u201d<br/></p><p>Loki shifts beneath you, clenching his jaw, holding himself tightly as unholy thoughts fill his mind again, all of which you star in. He couldn\u2019t possibly imagine you ever sharing his affections for you, he only thinks your harmless flirting is just apart of your friendly banter, not that you care for him as well. In his mind, he\u2019s still the monster people think of him as, not how you <i>really </i>see him. After getting to know him, you now see him as kind, warm, gentle, if not mischievous and an expert at manipulation and smirking, always winking slyly from across the room at you.\u00a0</p><p>You might just say you are slowly falling for him.\u00a0</p><p>He laughs nervously,\u00a0\u201cJust read, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d you roll your eyes, opening the book back up to the spot you\u2019re looking for, skimming your finger over the printed words. You smile once you find it,\u00a0\u201c\u2019There I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn\u2019t care,\u2019\u201d you whisper, your sweet, velvet like voice nearly lulling Loki to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>Loki wraps his arms around you, shaking his head,\u00a0\u201cHow tragic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTragic?\u201d you ask.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, not tragic. <i>Shakespeare</i> is tragic. When I read this, all I hear is new beginnings and accepting love from not only others but alsop herself.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat I hear is someone falling in love with someone who\u2019s party obsessed, arrogant, foolish, and only ends up being murdered in the end, it\u2019s tragic. She\u2019s fallen for the wrong person, down the wrong path, and it only ends in heartbreak and disaster.\u201d<br/></p><p>You spin yourself around, laying face up on him now, resting your chin against his chest,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re only seeing half the picture here, not what the author wants you to see, now <i>that </i>you have to look for. Gatsby only throws these parties in an attempt to get Daisy\u2019s attention and have her attend them, he\u2019s parading all the wrong things, but that\u2019s only because he\u2019s human and he\u2019s used to the people in his lives only be attracted to his wealth, not him. She\u2019s the first that defies that,\u201d you lay out for him, hand gestures and all.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Loki smiles, tongue in cheek, an action that cause heat to pool into the pit of your stomach and a blush in your cheeks,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve always prided myself in being insightful and intelligent, but it seems I\u2019ve been beaten for the title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met your match, Loki Lafeuyson,\u201d you return his kind smile, tucking your hands beneath your chin, fluttering your lashes teasingly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIndeed I have,\u201d he agrees, realizing now just how far he\u2019s fallen.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d you ask him, his fingers tracing light circles into your thin, t-shirt clad back.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He runs his hand closer to where the clasp of your bra lays, idly fiddling with the lace of your brassiere, meeting your eyes for only a moment. A smirk filled with enough sin to lead anyone astray graces his delightfully pink lips, your breath catching at the sight of it.</p><p>He takes notice of this and his smirk only widens, a hand sliding down to grip your waist, eliciting a small whimper from you,\u00a0\u201cMm, kitten, the noises you make when I touch you are absolutely sinful&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoki&hellip;\u201d you warn him, afraid of what you\u2019ll start if he continues, lips curling when his hand slips beneath your shirt, his cool hands contrasting against your red hot skin.</p><p>\u201cDarling&hellip;\u201d he purrs and just his voice alone is enough to almost send you over the edge, to the point of no return. He meets your eyes for a moment, as if asking for permission for this little game the two of you are about to play, you nod before thinking better of it, heat creeping up the back of your neck at his impish smile.\u00a0</p><p>He reaches your back and expertly, yet agonizingly slow, unclasps the hook and slips your bra out from underneath your shirt, tossing it onto the floor.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat was impressive,\u201d you say and it\u2019s your turn to smile with your tongue in your cheek, feeling suddenly exposed in front of him even with a shirt on. But the two of you constantly undress each other with your eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, love, you haven\u2019t seen nothing yet,\u201d he whispers in the quiet room, flipping the two of you over so he\u2019s on top of you, one hand holding himself above you, positioned in between your legs.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game, Loki,\u201d you whisper coolly, chest heaving with each inhale and exhale of breath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThe only way I know how,\u201d he winks, scanning your body with darkened eyes, licking his bottom lip, watching you squirm beneath him.\u00a0\u201cWhat <i>are </i>you doing to me, kitten?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only returning the favor,\u201d you smile, rolling your hips against his, satisfied when you see the way he grits his teeth and closes his eyes from just your touch.<br/></p><p>\u201cNaughty, <i>naughty </i>girl,\u201d he purrs, shaking his head with a low chuckle.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned from the best,\u201d you respond smugly.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou certainly have,\u201d he muses, flashing another criminal smile.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start something you can\u2019t finish, Loki,\u201d you tell him, one hand reaching up to cup the side of his face.</p><p>He leans into your touch, kissing the inside of your palm sweetly,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not the one that did, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I did?\u201d you laugh.\u00a0\u201cBy slapping you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to admit I was hooked from the beginning, my pet,\u201d he smiles, dipping down to place tender kisses against the soft skin of your neck, making you gasp at the sensation of his cold lips on your body.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m enchanted by you, in all ways possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems the spell I cast on you has worked, it was my plan all along,\u201d you tease him with a small laugh, inhaling sharply once more when he begins to nip and suck and bite on the hollow of your collarbone. That would surely leave a mark in the coming days. You know that\u2019s what he wants, to mark you as his, his territory. The thought excited you. Being <i>his</i>. You can\u2019t believe how good he is at this, so easily making you beg for more and grovel at his feet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI really hope your joking, darling,\u201d he teases back.\u00a0\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if you weren\u2019t.\u201d<br/></p><p>You breathe out a laugh. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll never know then,\u201d you raise an eyebrow when he breaks away to look at you. His striking eyes wash over you, paired with another gorgeous smirk. Those eyes fall on your lips, and he darts his tongue out to wet his own.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kiss me, Loki?\u201d you ask softly, taking his face in your hands again, drawing small circles with your thumb on his cheek.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI want to, believe me. <i>Desperately</i>,\u201d he says, breath catching when you meet his eyes, he fumbles for the right words. \u201cBut&hellip; are you sure?\u201d he breaks his gaze away from your slightly parted lips, willing himself to look elsewhere.\u00a0\u201cBecause-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLoki&hellip;\u201d you coo softly, playing with the tips of his marvelous, raven hair, looking him in the eye, both of you breathing harshly, so close your noses bump into each other and lips brush, heart beating loud in your own chest. Not even kissing, yet electricity shoots through both of you, your eyes fluttering closed from the pleasure.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life.

Loki watches you with a softness in his alluring green and blue eyes, you can never make up your mind of which color they are, so you\u2019ve decided to say both, never knowing which one fits him best.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about, love?\u201d he leans back against the couch cushion, lifting his eyes from his book to chance a glance at you and your beautiful smile.<br></p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d you hum happily, looking at him from where you lay with a big, bright grin.\u00a0\u201cI love this quote from the book.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou sound so passionate when you talk about literature, darling, your face is lighting up,\u201d he notices with a warm expression. \u201cDo you write?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger I would,\u201d you reminisce, sighing contently, smiling at the far off memories playing through your mind.\u00a0\u201cI had this little spot\u2026 in my backyard, under my favorite tree, a <i>willow </i>tree, and I would sit there\u2026\u201d you pause to laugh lightly.\u00a0\u201cAnd just bring out my journal, scribbling outlandish fairy tales about mythical creatures and true love. I barely even knew what love was at that age\u2026 too bad all of it was destroyed in the fire, I bet reading it would have been hilarious,\u201d you laugh, but it comes out sadder than you intended.</p><p>His embrace on you tightens when he sees your frown, \u201cDon\u2019t discount yourself, love,\u201d he says, an amused tone in his words despite his reassurance.\u00a0\u201cWho knows, young (y/n) could have been the next Hemingway\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, God no, comparing me to him is an insult to his craft, I\u2019m nowhere near as talented,\u201d you shake your head with a smile.\u00a0\u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t written in so long.\u201d<br></p><p>He shakes his head, wondering how someone as astonishing as you could think so little of yourself, \u201cWriting, my dear, is like riding a bike, once you learn, you never forget how to do it, and with practice, you get better and better,\u201d he explains, setting his book down next to him on the small table beside you two.<br></p><p>\u201cRead the quote to me, kitten,\u201d he whispers, shifting you so that he\u2019s laying down and your laying with the back of your head against his hard, surprisingly muscular chest. His hands found your hair, playing with it lazily, desperately needing to touch you in anyway he can, even if it\u2019s not the way he truly wants.<br></p><p>You raise your eyebrows,\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d you ask him, turning to look him in the eye, not finding any doubts or hesitance in them. Or he\u2019s just very good at hiding it.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to bore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026\u201d he whispers, rolling his eyes with a graciously soft smile, catching you off guard.\u00a0\u201cThe next time you say something about yourself that is other than only good things, I will knock you off this couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d you scoff.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know who you\u2019re talking to, love? I am the god of tricks, I can do <i>far </i>worse if so is requested <i>or </i>deserved,\u201d he says with a slight raise of his brow, a wicked glint in his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRequested?\u201d you can\u2019t help but grin at the insinuation.\u00a0\u201cPerhaps I should begin reading before I take you up on that offer.\u201d<br></p><p>Loki shifts beneath you, clenching his jaw, holding himself tightly as unholy thoughts fill his mind again, all of which you star in. He couldn\u2019t possibly imagine you ever sharing his affections for you, he only thinks your harmless flirting is just apart of your friendly banter, not that you care for him as well. In his mind, he\u2019s still the monster people think of him as, not how you <i>really </i>see him. After getting to know him, you now see him as kind, warm, gentle, if not mischievous and an expert at manipulation and smirking, always winking slyly from across the room at you.\u00a0</p><p>You might just say you are slowly falling for him.\u00a0</p><p>He laughs nervously,\u00a0\u201cJust read, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d you roll your eyes, opening the book back up to the spot you\u2019re looking for, skimming your finger over the printed words. You smile once you find it,\u00a0\u201c\u2019There I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn\u2019t care,\u2019\u201d you whisper, your sweet, velvet like voice nearly lulling Loki to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>Loki wraps his arms around you, shaking his head,\u00a0\u201cHow tragic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTragic?\u201d you ask.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, not tragic. <i>Shakespeare</i> is tragic. When I read this, all I hear is new beginnings and accepting love from not only others but alsop herself.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat I hear is someone falling in love with someone who\u2019s party obsessed, arrogant, foolish, and only ends up being murdered in the end, it\u2019s tragic. She\u2019s fallen for the wrong person, down the wrong path, and it only ends in heartbreak and disaster.\u201d<br></p><p>You spin yourself around, laying face up on him now, resting your chin against his chest,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re only seeing half the picture here, not what the author wants you to see, now <i>that </i>you have to look for. Gatsby only throws these parties in an attempt to get Daisy\u2019s attention and have her attend them, he\u2019s parading all the wrong things, but that\u2019s only because he\u2019s human and he\u2019s used to the people in his lives only be attracted to his wealth, not him. She\u2019s the first that defies that,\u201d you lay out for him, hand gestures and all.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Loki smiles, tongue in cheek, an action that cause heat to pool into the pit of your stomach and a blush in your cheeks,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve always prided myself in being insightful and intelligent, but it seems I\u2019ve been beaten for the title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met your match, Loki Lafeuyson,\u201d you return his kind smile, tucking your hands beneath your chin, fluttering your lashes teasingly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIndeed I have,\u201d he agrees, realizing now just how far he\u2019s fallen.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d you ask him, his fingers tracing light circles into your thin, t-shirt clad back.\u00a0<br></p><p>He runs his hand closer to where the clasp of your bra lays, idly fiddling with the lace of your brassiere, meeting your eyes for only a moment. A smirk filled with enough sin to lead anyone astray graces his delightfully pink lips, your breath catching at the sight of it.</p><p>He takes notice of this and his smirk only widens, a hand sliding down to grip your waist, eliciting a small whimper from you,\u00a0\u201cMm, kitten, the noises you make when I touch you are absolutely sinful\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoki\u2026\u201d you warn him, afraid of what you\u2019ll start if he continues, lips curling when his hand slips beneath your shirt, his cool hands contrasting against your red hot skin.</p><p>\u201cDarling\u2026\u201d he purrs and just his voice alone is enough to almost send you over the edge, to the point of no return. He meets your eyes for a moment, as if asking for permission for this little game the two of you are about to play, you nod before thinking better of it, heat creeping up the back of your neck at his impish smile.\u00a0</p><p>He reaches your back and expertly, yet agonizingly slow, unclasps the hook and slips your bra out from underneath your shirt, tossing it onto the floor.<br></p><p>\u201cThat was impressive,\u201d you say and it\u2019s your turn to smile with your tongue in your cheek, feeling suddenly exposed in front of him even with a shirt on. But the two of you constantly undress each other with your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, love, you haven\u2019t seen nothing yet,\u201d he whispers in the quiet room, flipping the two of you over so he\u2019s on top of you, one hand holding himself above you, positioned in between your legs.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game, Loki,\u201d you whisper coolly, chest heaving with each inhale and exhale of breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThe only way I know how,\u201d he winks, scanning your body with darkened eyes, licking his bottom lip, watching you squirm beneath him.\u00a0\u201cWhat <i>are </i>you doing to me, kitten?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only returning the favor,\u201d you smile, rolling your hips against his, satisfied when you see the way he grits his teeth and closes his eyes from just your touch.<br></p><p>\u201cNaughty, <i>naughty </i>girl,\u201d he purrs, shaking his head with a low chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned from the best,\u201d you respond smugly.<br></p><p>\u201cYou certainly have,\u201d he muses, flashing another criminal smile.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start something you can\u2019t finish, Loki,\u201d you tell him, one hand reaching up to cup the side of his face.</p><p>He leans into your touch, kissing the inside of your palm sweetly,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not the one that did, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I did?\u201d you laugh.\u00a0\u201cBy slapping you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to admit I was hooked from the beginning, my pet,\u201d he smiles, dipping down to place tender kisses against the soft skin of your neck, making you gasp at the sensation of his cold lips on your body.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m enchanted by you, in all ways possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems the spell I cast on you has worked, it was my plan all along,\u201d you tease him with a small laugh, inhaling sharply once more when he begins to nip and suck and bite on the hollow of your collarbone. That would surely leave a mark in the coming days. You know that\u2019s what he wants, to mark you as his, his territory. The thought excited you. Being <i>his</i>. You can\u2019t believe how good he is at this, so easily making you beg for more and grovel at his feet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI really hope your joking, darling,\u201d he teases back.\u00a0\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if you weren\u2019t.\u201d<br></p><p>You breathe out a laugh. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll never know then,\u201d you raise an eyebrow when he breaks away to look at you. His striking eyes wash over you, paired with another gorgeous smirk. Those eyes fall on your lips, and he darts his tongue out to wet his own.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kiss me, Loki?\u201d you ask softly, taking his face in your hands again, drawing small circles with your thumb on his cheek.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI want to, believe me. <i>Desperately</i>,\u201d he says, breath catching when you meet his eyes, he fumbles for the right words. \u201cBut\u2026 are you sure?\u201d he breaks his gaze away from your slightly parted lips, willing himself to look elsewhere.\u00a0\u201cBecause-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLoki\u2026\u201d you coo softly, playing with the tips of his marvelous, raven hair, looking him in the eye, both of you breathing harshly, so close your noses bump into each other and lips brush, heart beating loud in your own chest. Not even kissing, yet electricity shoots through both of you, your eyes fluttering closed from the pleasure.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life. Because I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my\u2026\u201d a smug, familiar voice says in the doorway, catching both of your attentions, heads snapping in their direction.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony. <i>Fucking</i>. Stark. And the rest of the Avengers. All in your home and all at once. Watching and ruining a moment between you and Loki.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReindeer games, and our sweet, sweet (y/n),\u201d Tony says, looking to Natasha who\u2019s smirking like an idiot.

He couldn\u2019t possibly imagine you ever sharing his affections for you, he only thinks your harmless flirting is just apart of your friendly banter, not that you care for him as well. In his mind, he\u2019s still the monster people think of him as, not how you <i>really </i>see him.

When I read this, all I hear is new beginnings and accepting love from not only others but alsop herself.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat I hear is someone falling in love with someone who\u2019s party obsessed, arrogant, foolish, and only ends up being murdered in the end, it\u2019s tragic.

Gatsby only throws these parties in an attempt to get Daisy\u2019s attention and have her attend them, he\u2019s parading all the wrong things, but that\u2019s only because he\u2019s human and he\u2019s used to the people in his lives only be attracted to his wealth, not him.

A smirk filled with enough sin to lead anyone astray graces his delightfully pink lips, your breath catching at the sight of it.</p><p>He takes notice of this and his smirk only widens, a hand sliding down to grip your waist, eliciting a small whimper from you,\u00a0\u201cMm, kitten, the noises you make when I touch you are absolutely sinful\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoki\u2026\u201d you warn him, afraid of what you\u2019ll start if he continues, lips curling when his hand slips beneath your shirt, his cool hands contrasting against your red hot skin.</p><p>\u201cDarling\u2026\u201d he purrs and just his voice alone is enough to almost send you over the edge, to the point of no return.

But the two of you constantly undress each other with your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, love, you haven\u2019t seen nothing yet,\u201d he whispers in the quiet room, flipping the two of you over so he\u2019s on top of you, one hand holding himself above you, positioned in between your legs.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game, Loki,\u201d you whisper coolly, chest heaving with each inhale and exhale of breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThe only way I know how,\u201d he winks, scanning your body with darkened eyes, licking his bottom lip, watching you squirm beneath him.\u00a0\u201cWhat <i>are </i>you doing to me, kitten?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only returning the favor,\u201d you smile, rolling your hips against his, satisfied when you see the way he grits his teeth and closes his eyes from just your touch.<br></p><p>\u201cNaughty, <i>naughty </i>girl,\u201d he purrs, shaking his head with a low chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned from the best,\u201d you respond smugly.<br></p><p>\u201cYou certainly have,\u201d he muses, flashing another criminal smile.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start something you can\u2019t finish, Loki,\u201d you tell him, one hand reaching up to cup the side of his face.</p><p>He leans into your touch, kissing the inside of your palm sweetly,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not the one that did, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I did?\u201d you laugh.\u00a0\u201cBy slapping you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to admit I was hooked from the beginning, my pet,\u201d he smiles, dipping down to place tender kisses against the soft skin of your neck, making you gasp at the sensation of his cold lips on your body.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m enchanted by you, in all ways possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems the spell I cast on you has worked, it was my plan all along,\u201d you tease him with a small laugh, inhaling sharply once more when he begins to nip and suck and bite on the hollow of your collarbone.
