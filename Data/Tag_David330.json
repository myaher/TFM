        "body": "<p><b>My first ever semi-fan fic, Editor!Hardy AU</b></p><p><b>Rating</b>: Mature, for deep angst and sexual content</p><p><b>Wordcount</b>: 6800</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: mentions of abuse, shades of dubcon (but it\u2019s very consensual)</p><hr><p>I was part of other fandoms as a teenager, and been disenchanted, so I didn\u2019t do it in adulthood. In my 20\u2032s, I was one of those bitches who barely watched television, didn\u2019t read comic books or stan actors/actresses, and only watched sometimes irritating, ridiculous indie films for the \u201cbrilliant photography\u201d. Artsy Hipster trash.<br/></p><p>I wrote for another popular blog - OC erotica - but I was miserable and uninspired. I was beyond writing just hanky-panky. I wanted to write <b>more</b> than porn, but at the time, I felt it was all I was good at. I didn\u2019t feel I had the focus and the creativity to breathe life into a character and give them a compelling story. I subscribed to Netflix out of boredom. I adored Olivia Colman. I avoided Broadchurch for months because I don\u2019t like police procedurals (ha! joke\u2019s on me) but I couldn\u2019t resist more Olivia. Enter Hardy.<i> I was bested.</i> I wrote this, left it alone in shame since I DON\u2019T DO FAN FICTION WTF EWW IT\u2019S SO EMBARRASSING UGH -</p><p>[I\u2019m really putting myself out there. Please forgive my blindness.]</p><p>But I had to come back to it a few months later. I had to finish it. For years and years, all this *waving at the beautiful madness* went over my head. Then, I saw David. Oop! It had to happen sometime. Here I am.</p><p>And here it is.</p><hr><p>Her heart hammered in her ears.<b><br/></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"441\" data-orig-width=\"441\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dr-10-rainwaters:JcQJ2STE5lKjoU9OJ8bEbw:ZQ4Kwh2F72MC3\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b0925c31f4cf4b9394cba5a2f430fe1/tumblr_oh5mu4oWtH1v8e12no1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"441\" data-orig-width=\"441\"/></figure><p>She yelled. She didn\u2019t mean to yell. It was his eyes, so extraordinarily lovely - the very heart of autumn - were impassive, even as she spilled over in his shitty cabinet of a kitchen, trembling and hyperventilating with emotion. He remained hunched over, silent.</p><p>She flexed her hand. Her wrist was numb. She banged it on his counter, making his cups tinkle. She cursed loud enough to make his neighbors stare as she ran back to her car.</p><p>The echo of what she said filled her with an exhilarating dread. He knew now. She laid everything bare. In her passion she hadn&rsquo;t only spoken her feelings for him, but made no secret of the way she felt about the way he lived his life. </p><p>Drama made her ill. She shivered, although sweat beaded her brow. She licked her lip and tasted salt. She couldn&rsquo;t drive like this. She grabbed her bag on the passenger seat, and for some reason, the act finally broke her.</p><p>Her breathless, strangled groans strengthened quickly to howls. She squeezed her bag in her hands, wrung the empty flaccid thing. Her tears were plentiful and fast, and soon the leather was streaked with saltwater. She looked back at the empty passenger seat and her body stiffened. She couldn&rsquo;t do it a second longer. Wait. Endure.</p><p>She opened the door to run.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d She nearly knocked him over.</p><p>She wiped her eyes violently. \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d She slammed the door and started down the entrance of his courtyard. The sodium lights made his brown hair flash auburn. </p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She kept walking. Her cheeks stung. \u201cYou can&rsquo;t go anywhere in that condition. Come inside. I&rsquo;ll make you a cup of tea.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She stopped walking, but didn&rsquo;t turn around.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. She heard the gravel under his heels, the slight hitch a back injury has caused.</p><p>She looked down at her waterlogged bag, then at the road. She followed him back to his cottage. He closed the door behind her, his delicate hands overly precious on the deadlock. She had wanted, and wondered at his hands. </p><p>Now he knew.</p><p>He walked to the kitchen, ducking his head on the glass fixture that hung too low. It swung softly as he made her favorite. He had made it many times - it was a thoughtless exercise. She ached, but still drank in his silence. The vertical lines between his eyes were deep. His hands were steady, pouring and stirring. The thought of his pity, of a kindness rendered to a friend in pain, made her mouth fill with saliva. She hiccuped.</p><p>He set the cup down in front of her. \u201cDrink.\u201d He adjusted his worn tie. His jaw clenched, but his eyes were soft. She took the cup in her hand, warm ceramic, rounded and comfortable. There was chip on the lip. She rubbed her bottom lip against it.</p><p>\u201cMy neighbor. He said you were crying in your car.\u201d </p><p>She swallowed too deeply, and hissed as it burned down her throat.</p><p>\u201cReally loudly.\u201d His eyes made her hand tremble. She put the cup down. Rolled her sore eyes. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to cause a disturbance.\u201d She meant it. Now that she was empty of passion, her outburst seemed ridiculous. She stood up. \u201cThank you. I&hellip;um&hellip;think I&rsquo;m okay to drive now.\u201d She took quick strides to the door. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry for everything I said it was ridiculous display <i>I&rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress lately please forget I ever did it-</i>\u201d Her words tumbled together. She hit the door running, nearly tore the knob off.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t want to forget.\u201d It was barely louder than breath.</p><p>She stopped cold, turned her head to look at him. He stood by his table, lips parted, with expectant eyes. She was punch drunk.</p><p>\u201cCome inside.\u201d He pointed to his sofa. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>She was dangerously close to tears again. She wanted to run into his arms, hug him, begin memorizing his limbs. Instead, she sat by him. He was silent for a full minute, looking down at his tented fingers. She looked at his hands too, empty, sifting the light. She waited. She could exist there forever, in that silence. It crackled. </p><p>\u201cTrouble,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He woke her from her day dream.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I saw you. You were none too kind,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe met at an awkward time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you thought I was here to micromanage you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. You did, for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble. Why?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou. It was what I thought the first time I saw you.\u201d He smiled down at his hands. \u201cYou&rsquo;re right, though. We did meet at an awkward time.\u201d</p><p>She had pieced together the two sentence story in the course of their year working together. </p><p>His wife cheated, then left. He was heartbroken. The end. Her story had more to it, but she had slowly discovered that it was no more heavy.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I&rsquo;m sorry for the outburst-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t be.\u201d </p><p>Her corners of her mouth turned up.</p><p>\u201cShe told me I drove her mad with my silences. She got frustrated and screamed like you. Banged around. Said she had to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded, but she waited.</p><p>\u201cAt first we laughed it of, made love and that would be the end of it. But eventually, she stopped trying. To fill the silences.\u201d</p><p>His hands were now fists at his knees. The light shone through his beard. The hair was golden, auburn, brown, and not thick enough to hide his jumping pulse. She wanted to touch him, but didn&rsquo;t. It was petulant.</p><p>\u201cThen, she was quieter than I was. Even when I found out, she was quiet. No excuse. No apology. Just a shrug, then silence. If I&rsquo;d known it was so horrifying, \u00a0I would&rsquo;ve tried-\u201d</p><p>He trembled beside her, then he was weeping. It was so sudden and intense she stared for a bit. His face was a grimace, his bottom lip trembling. His sobs were desperate, sloppy. His pain was completely on the surface. She touched him, finally, two fingers on his cheek. Questioning. The heat of his tears made her nipples harden. </p><p>He leaned into her and wrapped his arms around her waist. He buried his head in her breast and she was in it now. Her sternum vibrated with his pain. He squeezed hard, gasped into her neck. His beard scratched at her saltsore skin. She had been angry before. He had made her feel like an echo. But there was more to him than what she thought. Her own tears soon wet his hair. She didn&rsquo;t weep, though. She didn&rsquo;t dare take that from him. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know how long they sat that way. His grip on her did not loosen. The front of her blouse stuck to her breasts with tears, saliva and his condensed breath but she was still. Even if he just shared his pain with her, it was something, and she would cherish it.</p><p>His sobs quieted to an occasional hiccup, but he did not raise his head. She scratched the short hairs at the back of his neck, took in the scent of his hair. Her body must&rsquo;ve reacted because he finally looked at her. His brown eyes were luminous with feeling. After a year of inscrutability, it made her gasp.</p><p>He took her in his arms, kissed her temple.</p><p>\u201cI didn&rsquo;t quite know how or why I did it. Just two months ago she stood in the same place you did. She loves me, she said. Misses me. I cried, hard, for her. Many nights, but not in a while. It&rsquo;s like she knew.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened again, but he rubbed her back. </p><p>\u201cShe told me what I fantasized about \u2013 that she had made a huge mistake, that he wasn&rsquo;t what she thought he was. That maybe my silences weren&rsquo;t that bad after all-\u201d he wheezed. She supposed it was meant to be a snort. \u201c-and that she wanted me to come home.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved slowly up her spine to squeeze the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cAs I looked at her, I finally figured out how she was different. Physically, she hadn&rsquo;t changed. Not really. Same hair, same skin, same scent. But she was \u2026 uh, smaller. She no longer took up all the air in the room.\u201d</p><p>He was looking out the window into the dark. \u201cShe knew, then. I didn&rsquo;t have to say a word. Despite all her complaints about my illegibility, she knew me well enough.\u201d His eyes were those of a man waking from a bad dream. He turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou. You called me a goddamn asshole.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks tingled. \u201cYou \u2026 saw me spinning out and didn&rsquo;t react. Your face was illegible. Illegible, ha! I was pissed. I&rsquo;m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh&hellip;\u201d a smiled played on his lips. She raised an eyebrow. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry. I was stone-faced because I wanted to smile, but I knew if I did, you might kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile?\u201d She tucked his damp hair behind his ear. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He let her go, reluctantly enough to make her sigh. She was quickly getting used to his touch. He rummaged in his desk, pulling at drawers that creaked.</p><p>\u201cJesus, why do you have that old thing?\u201d She walked over and traced the scratched surface.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s my lucky desk. Been with me all my life, I&rsquo;m never getting rid of it.\u201d </p><p>There was a box of various awards in the corner. \u201cOoh. Shiny things.\u201d He walked into the dark alcove of his bedroom, muttering to himself.</p><p>She rummaged. His name, then \u201cEditor of the Year\u201d etched into\u00a0 a glass block. Parchment. Metal. She picked up a diploma. Cornell University. Master\u2019s in Journalism. She blew the dust off.\u201cWhy haven&rsquo;t you hung this up in your office? Lord knows it cost enough.\u201d There was no response.</p><p>There was a black and white photo at the bottom of the box, dustiest of all. A woman and a man kissing in bed. The Eiffel Tower twinkled in the distance, perfectly centered. It was a postcard.</p><p>She hesitated, then picked it up and wiped the dust off. He was young and beautiful, his long lean body naked above the waist. There were no lines at the corners of his closed eyes, no gray in the temples. There was a smile on the woman&rsquo;s mouth. Her brow was pale and smooth \u2013 she was worried about how the photo would come out, not about the kiss. She unconsciously traced the curve of his back, making a line on the dusty glass.</p><p>\u201cFound it!\u201d He snatched the photo frame away and replaced it with something. It was an old composition book \u2013 the kind with the black and white pattern on the cover. She giggled.</p><p>\u201cGood lord, I haven&rsquo;t seen one of these since middle school!\u201d She opened it and saw a trimmed printout stapled to the page. A news article. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the sofa and began to riffle through the pages. There were printouts from papers in Los Angeles, Houston, Boston, New York. His spidery handwriting littered all the empty spaces, spilling onto the lined pages. She kept flipping. Phoenix, Miami. He sat and leaned into her. The weight and scent of him distracted her. She stared at him as he looked for something in the pages.</p><p>\u201cHere. Look.\u201d She wanted to kiss him, but didn\u2019t act on it. Perhaps her outburst had knocked something loose in him \u2013 nothing more. His eyes twinkled. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d She brought the book closer to her face. It was an old article from when she was a Dear Abbie-type columnist for a local paper in Connecticut. She flipped the page. There was more, marked up like the others. There were underlined bits, and many exclamation marks.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t dare read the notations, for fear of ruining the moment. He was ruthless with a pen. That&rsquo;s why they called him Zorro.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife \u2013 my ex-wife. She&rsquo;s from there, and most of her family still lives there. She has a subscription to feel a bit closer to them, know what&rsquo;s going on.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.\u201cWhy all the articles?\u201d</p><p>He took the book from her. \u201cI was searching. I had grown bored in LA, and I wanted something new. These are the best and brightest I could find from around the States,\u201d he said, rifling through the pages. He stopped at Houston. \u201cShe figured out the connection between Mexican vegetables and the Mob \u2013 nearly got herself killed. She&rsquo;s still under police protection.\u201d</p><p>He flipped to Miami. \u201cThis kid wrote a police corruption article that got the commissioner fired. Just 23 years old he was,\u201d he smiled and shook his head. \u201cGood stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wrote witty responses to housewives and teenagers.\u201d She wasn&rsquo;t cowed, but she was curious. How did she fit in then, or even now? She was a lowly staff writer. Frankly, before he was there to make her mad, she had been miserable. She had been about to quit and go back to school for literature when he came \u2013 had even put in the transfer request at her old university. One look, and school was forgotten.</p><p>He closed the book. \u201cOne evening my wife was laughing, loud \u2013 a rare sound in our house by that time - and I was curious. She sent me the link. In ten minutes, I had the first printout stapled to the journal.\u201d</p><p>She still didn&rsquo;t understand the link. She shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou&rsquo;re really, really good. Has anyone told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what? Regurgitating press releases? By your savage editing, I would think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind that,\u201d he dismissed her comment. \u201cYou&rsquo;re a very good writer. Brilliant, if you&rsquo;re not writing about the latest murder or terrorist act.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him.\u201cSo I&rsquo;m mediocre at my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes widened. He was usually very frank, but considering what had just happened, it was a bit much.</p><p>He noticed. \u201cNo. Well, sort of. Let me explain. You have no peer that I know of in painting a picture in words, but it must be <i>your</i> picture. You&rsquo;re not the best copy machine, so to speak. Your boredom bleeds through and stains it.\u201d He spoke with his hands when he was excited, and he did then, wriggling his fingers in feigned disgust.</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t sure what was happening. She had cried. Then he had cried. And now she was \u2026 boring? She couldn&rsquo;t process where the evening was headed. Her eyes still felt gritty from crying. His tears and sweat were making her breasts itch.</p><p>\u201cYour wife&rsquo;s family is from Greenwich?\u201d It was all she could think to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She read the paper daily. Eventually, so did I. At least, your bit. Until you announced you were moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d </p><p>He looked at her, expecting more. She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cUh, and when I saw that, I was curious as to who you were and whether you were moving to another paper or moving on literally. Quitting. It put a fire under my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife knows the editor in chief \u2013 \u00a0they went to school together, you know, and she did me the favor of asking about you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. He smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cStalker.\u201d It was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cAdmirer. Fan.\u201d</p><p>Now she was dizzy. \u201cBut, how exactly? You were there, not two months after I started. As far as I know, the editor before you wasn&rsquo;t going to retire for several years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the owner saw my dusty box of awards, she gave him an offer he couldn&rsquo;t refuse. And I was in.\u201d He picked at a ragged corner of the journal. \u201cIt was during that time that my wife left me. During the move.\u201d</p><p>The first time they met he was dour-faced and rumpled. She figured it was stress. But he was freshly wounded.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He was timid with his revelation.</p><p>\u201cYou didn&rsquo;t know me. Why? What if I had been \u2026 I don&rsquo;t know, a pseudonym for a gay man? A 60 year old woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered. Doesn&rsquo;t take away from your brilliance. I was ready for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I knew you were trouble from the moment you walked into my office with your printed scarf and your hair curling all around your face. You were so earnest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause you were hurt. I could feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was illegible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn&rsquo;t blinded then. We were bickering in minutes.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cYou are infuriating at times. Need a filter installed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the pot to the kettle.\u201d He was right. The atmosphere became suddenly heavy, and it took effort not to lean over and put her mouth on his. </p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re the kettle right? You&rsquo;ve got the spout.\u201d She wiggled her pinkie finger. </p><p>He wrapped his fingers around it, stilling her. \u201dWhat are you trying to say?\u201d His breath was sweet and warm on her cheek. Honeyed. The juvenile silliness of the sentiment made her giggle. He thought she was a good writer.</p><p>\u201cMediocre, yet brilliant,\u201d she said out loud.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex-wife. She&rsquo;s a famous photographer?\u201d </p><p>He was perplexed, but he responded. \u201cYes.\u201d She blinked slowly, waited. \u201cWe met in college. I was editor of the paper. She wasn\u2019t famous yet, but promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe&rsquo;s brave. That spread on Aleppo for Time was amazing.\u201d And it was.</p><p>\u201cNot brave enough,\u201d he said, and stood up abruptly. \u201cWant a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What d'you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBourbon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I&rsquo;ll have it neat.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow and reached for the bottle on the shelf. She had never had the opportunity to observe him like she wanted to, but it was late and he was pouring her whiskey. She didn&rsquo;t care anymore. </p><p>He was lean, and tall. He sometimes didn&rsquo;t wear an undershirt, so there were peeks of skin between the buttons when he stood or sat a certain way. It had been driving her mad for months. When she was touching herself she was bold in her thoughts and she fantasized of straddling him, slowly taking off his wire rims and sliding a finger slowly in and out of the gaps, caressing the furry flesh of his chest with her knuckles until his eyes gave her permission. She would slide off his lap to the floor and bite the buttons off, not rip. She wanted to feel the slight pain of it in her teeth, have the perverse pleasure of spitting each one out. She would lick the sweat that beaded on his taut belly, rip his zipper open- </p><p>The glasses tinkled in his hand.</p><p>It made her blush to think that she didn&rsquo;t want to care about his pleasure. She wanted to use only her mouth on him, take deep breaths of the secret scent trapped in his pubic hair, feel herself throb and trickle down her thighs. She would take his cock in her mouth, deep enough to make her throat contract, her hands claws at his narrow hips. She moaned at the deep red half moons her nails would leave. She would suck him so deep when he finally came and he withdrew there would be no semen dripping on her chin, just her hungry spittle.</p><p>She would finish herself off then, her clit a solid, pulsing thing, not just a button but the whole of her hips, with the taste and scent of his musk deep in her head-</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he said. She sighed shakily. He handed her the glass and she drank it down in two gulps, trying to kill the fire in her belly. She was wet. She wondered whether she had soaked through her jeans. She shook the glass. He poured her another, amused.</p><p>\u201cI thought you rarely drank.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Now</i>. There was once a time where I could drink \u2013 excuse my expression \u2013 an Irish Catholic under the table. I stopped for very vain reasons.\u201d She drank again, and only then did she feel the faraway burn of the liquor. It was a pale facsimile to her own heat.</p><p>\u201cVain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It dries out my beautiful skin,\u201d She gave him a crooked grin. She hadn&rsquo;t eaten much, so it was working fast.</p><p>He shot his, and she looked again. He sat, spread legged and barefoot. He was full, heavy between his legs. She was pointlessly empty and aching between hers. She gasped she wanted to touch him so much. It unnerved her.</p><p>She licked an amber drop from the rim of the glass. \u00a0\u201cI know why she chose you.\u201d She stood up, walked to his desk again, looked through his box and lifted out a photo with his old school newspaper staff. \u00a0He was in the middle with his arms slung around another young man. Tall, almost wispy, but everyone&rsquo;s eyes were on him. He was luminous, his smile a wonder. </p><p>He walked behind her. She put the photo back into the box. \u201cShe&rsquo;s got a brilliant eye.\u201d</p><p>She poured herself another drink. He looked bashful, almost.</p><p>\u201cYou chose each other, but soon after you married, you realized she chose you for the wrong reason. You hoped it would be because you were promising, talented, but nope.\u201d</p><p>She was spinning out again. She was on hormones and liquor, and naturally self-destructive.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re beautiful. You try to hide it behind wire rims and cheap suits, but you are. So. Fucking. Beautiful. And it&rsquo;s not just physical, but your very being is maddening. You make grown women want to rock back in forth in the fetal position, holding themselves. That&rsquo;s why you overcompensate with the nice. Sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, bemused.</p><p>\u201cShe was a treasure to you, the whole package, but you \u2026 you are a prize.\u201d She pointed at him with the glass.</p><p>He reacted, became rigid. She giggled at the irony of it, even though she knew it hurt. It was reckless.</p><p>She drank slow. \u201c&hellip;A shallow thing. Even with the gray and the lines you are. Better even, flavored with experience, and heartbreak.\u201d She exaggerated the &lsquo;k&rsquo;. \u201cI&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s why she wanted to get her teeth back into you. You&rsquo;re a whole new flavor now.\u201d</p><p>As ever, she drank too much, too fast. The prospect of killing her constant pain made it impossible to ever be responsible with drugs. She caressed the bottle, appreciated the fact he wasn&rsquo;t so foolish as to take it from her.</p><p>\u201cIt seems you&rsquo;ve always had a talent for cutting through to the truth,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPity I&rsquo;m a mediocre journalist, then.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face, sighed. \u201cI didn&rsquo;t mean to offend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t give a shit about that,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you keep mentioning it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s so \u2026 ingenuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m brilliant.\u201d It wasn&rsquo;t a question. She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYes. And I&rsquo;m paid very well because I&rsquo;m fucking good at knowing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. You used the word fuck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is happening? Why are you like this? Again, if I said something to upset you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, god dammit.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes shimmered.\u201cI know why you&rsquo;re doing this, so stop.\u201d He took her in his arms. \u201cI know.\u201d He took a deep breath in her hair. She smelled of whiskey and sweat. She untangled herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know? Your life was perfect. Good family. Good schools. Beautiful wife.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas. Apt choice of words. And yes, I know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don&rsquo;t.\u201d She felt out of control again. \u201cI should go home.\u201d He didn&rsquo;t physically try to stop her. She didn&rsquo;t know whether to be relieved or hurt.</p><p>\u201cSomeone stole you, and you&rsquo;re just trying to protect what&rsquo;s left.\u201d</p><p>Her face twisted with emotion. \u201c'Protect what&rsquo;s left&rsquo;? Who told you that?\u201d Tears leaked out of the corners of her eyes. He took a step toward her, hand out to touch. </p><p>\u201cYou can dish it out, but you can&rsquo;t take it?\u201d His jaw muscles tightened underneath his beard. She hated herself.</p><p>\u201cNo one did. No, you did. In your work.\u201d He tried to hug her, but she pushed him away. He stood for several seconds, arms extended, his eyes tender.</p><p>\u201cYou want to save me? Make the boo boo all better?\u201d She was on her last wind. If it didn&rsquo;t put him off, she wouldn&rsquo;t have strength to run again. Her heart roared in her ears. Her chest hurt with tears she had not cried because no one would care about them, or about her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. It was quiet. He sat down. She gasped, sucked up an errant sob.\u201cI can&rsquo;t pretend to know about the depth and breadth of your pain, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-you can&rsquo;t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t want to save you, you&rsquo;re a grown woman. I just \u2026 want you. All the time. Every day. Every hour. The scent and savor, your breath, your words. I want to feel the pain with you. I want to love it out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s not that simple.\u201d She can&rsquo;t believe what she had heard, but her mouth spoke before thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd? Worthwhile things never are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA silly platitude.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBased on a very serious truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m not \u2026 worth all that.\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed. It made her jump.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what&rsquo;s so fucking funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just show you?\u201d He pointed to the journal. \u201cI know you&rsquo;re hurting, but are you being willfully obtuse?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI moved across the country to get a glimpse of you! My wife wasn&rsquo;t happy about it. She loves L.A. East Coast sensibilities never suited her. That&rsquo;s a quote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m mediocre, and dense. Why don&rsquo;t you go three for three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck it. You&rsquo;re being a bitch.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but it was brassy. Fake. His eyes were alight with anger, and even then, he was lovely. She would lose him and spend her life wondering what he saw in her. It was a peacock chasing a nightingale.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d He was breathless. She hadn&rsquo;t realized she had spoken out loud. He walked into his bedroom and threw something on the desk. It was a well worn proof, a slim book with no cover. The pages were curling on the edges with love. She picked it up and looked at it. She knew what it was before opening it.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this? It didn&rsquo;t make it to print.\u201d </p><p>He plucked it from her hands and looked through it with a familiarity that made her feel instantly guilty.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve got my people.\u201d He cleared his throat and read from a dog-eared page:</p><p><i>She didn&rsquo;t dare tell anyone how much love confounded her. She hated the feeling of floating. Being out of control, blinded by her desire, irritated her to no end. She had been alone for a long time, by choice. Her sight had been crystal clear to observe others floating, while she was mercifully weighted down to earth by her pain.</i></p><p>She leaned on the desk, silent.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you refuse to publish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know everything about me. Give it a guess.\u201d She couldn&rsquo;t look at him.</p><p>\u201cI can&rsquo;t even begin to guess. It's\u2026 when I found out and spoke to Harriman, he was completely perplexed. Said you sent the check back in full and told him to get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I would sue if he published.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou signed a contract. Technically, they had a right to publish. He told me you fired your agent and showed up at his door, begged until he agreed to tear it up. He felt sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were scared. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be long-winded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He guided her to the sofa, sat her down.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger and still lived at home, I used to nick all the books my sisters got from school and read them - if I hadn&rsquo;t already. They invariably came to me for help with essays and things, so it was just a smart thing to do, it saved time. One of them came home with The Bell Jar. Before then, I&rsquo;d only had very limited experience with Sylvia Plath. I don&rsquo;t have much patience for poetry, since it picks at my scabs, so to speak. Anyway, I read it and it frightened me. It&rsquo;s the only book that I couldn&rsquo;t finish reading. I couldn&rsquo;t help her with her essay. She got a dismal grade and hated me for a bit.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his, rubbed his lips against her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cShe wore her pain so openly. It\u2019s obscene. I don&rsquo;t want that, but I don&rsquo;t know how else to express myself. Why should I let it go public? Spreading it around doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lessen it. I don&rsquo;t want strangers pining indulgently with my pain. It&rsquo;s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a wonder,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDaniel&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple again, sweetly. It was a theme with him. She wanted to let go, turn her head, but muscle memory won.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m not who you think I am. I&rsquo;m no treasure. When I want to caress, I maul. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know who you are then. And I&rsquo;m willing to bleed a little to find out.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSilly man. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking. I live on that shed blood. And you&rsquo;re a thin one. Might not last too long.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to be funny, but it came off grim.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever worked so hard to get a woman to kiss me.\u201d He rubbed his lips against her cheekbone, his arms going around her waist.</p><p>\u201cAfter all that, you still want me?\u201d She felt emotionally overstretched. She wondered what time it was. Even the crickets were silent.</p><p>\u201cI am singularly concerned with what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn&rsquo;t conceive of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I couldn&rsquo;t read that look earlier?\u201d</p><p>She was amused.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s kind of what I do. Read between the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhuh. And?\u201d Her voice was shaky, despite herself.</p><p>\u201cYou said I was beautiful. No woman&rsquo;s called me that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. Impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not one. I&rsquo;ve been called hot. Sexy, or handsome. Never beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It makes the sentiment ours alone. You think I&rsquo;m beautiful. It&rsquo;s glorious.\u201d He giggled. He was so close his lashes tickled her. The roof of her mouth tingled like it did whenever she craved kisses. He kissed her cheek, then her jaw, and moved down. He squeezed her knee, then slowly pulled her legs open. She looked down, then closed her legs quickly.</p><p>She had soaked through her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhy so shy?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand dismissively. \u201cI&rsquo;m tired, Daniel. It&rsquo;s been a weird night. I should go home.\u201d She was coming down off her whiskey high. She had exposed too much of herself.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d He slid off the sofa. He was on his knees in front of her. He spread her thighs again and looked at the wet spot. His eyes moved from between her legs to her flat belly, then up to her breasts. Her nipples hardened again. </p><p>\u201cTell me, then. What was I thinking?\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled at her, a slow smile that narrowed his eyes and relaxed his shoulders. It took her breath away. He leaned in for a kiss. She closed her eyes and parted her lips, conquered. She felt his mouth on her cunt instead. He breathed her in deeply, eyes closed, as his fingers found her fly. He pulled her jeans down with her panties. There were welts on her hips he was so forceful. She was sodden, an obscene pink that betrayed her. He pulled at her buttons, lost patience, then pulled the shirt over her head. He pulled her bra over her head, too impatient to unhook. She was naked except for her socks. He pulled them off, then bit the concave of her arches.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s not fair,\u201d she said. He placed her legs over his shoulders, rubbed his prickly cheeks on her inner thighs. He couldn&rsquo;t kiss for licking. \u201cI&rsquo;m completely naked, and you&rsquo;re fully dressed.\u201d She ran her fingers through his thick hair. He sighed into her. It was delicious. He stopped and pulled his tie around so it hung down his back and placed it in her hand.</p><p>\u201cTry and stop me if you like.\u201d He spread her inner lips open with his tongue, licked from her opening to the base of her clit&hellip;then bit. Not hard, but to push back the hood and steady her swollen bud to lick hungry circles into it.</p><p>She cursed and pulled, but he fought her. He squeezed both breasts, tugged at her nipples to the point of pain. She was suddenly scared. She had no anonymity with him like she had with the men she carefully picked online. She could play a part with them. \u00a0But not with Dan. If he made her come, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to bounce away unscathed. Like a stray kitten, if he fed her, she&rsquo;d be back for his milk every day. She knew it.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Stop.\u201d She pulled on his tie. He buried the bottom of his face in her even deeper, though he was getting red from lack of breath. His fingers trailed red down her ribcage to her hips.</p><p>He began to suck on her. It was a hard, quick rhythm that made her pant, and she lost the strength to tug. He groaned into her, pushing her legs together against his face. He wanted to be surrounded by her, hidden away. He had fallen completely in love with her brittle strength, and was drugged by her fragility. He would break her and then help her put herself back together. He hoped she would let him. </p><p>Break her. The thought made him moan, long and rough, into her cunt. He wanted her all to himself. He was more hurt that he let on by her hesitation. </p><p>He stopped and unbuckled his belt, pulled down his underwear. Her eyes were wide and shiny, her mouth swollen although it was \u00a0unkissed. He resisted the urge and squeezed himself, gasping at the ache at the slightest touch of his fingers. Her lips formed into a moist O as he slid into her. It wasn&rsquo;t slow, or gentle. He pressed her thighs apart and fucked her hard and deep. He rocked her frame with each thrust, but she didn&rsquo;t moan or gasp. Her eyes rolled closed and she turned her face away.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t you dare. Look at me.\u201d He wrapped his hands around her waist, wondering at the tautness of her muscles. She opened her eyes. Her tongue was a glossy rose that made his balls tighten. But she didn&rsquo;t turn her head.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d She spread her legs wider and sighed. It was odd she didn&rsquo;t touch him. Cruel.</p><p>He took her hand, laced his fingers through hers and placed it above her head. She finally met his gaze. As soon as she did, she let out moan and curled into herself. She squeezed painfully around him but he fucked through it, ecstatic with her sudden warmth. He leaned into her and she caressed his face. She slid two fingers in his panting mouth, rubbed the pads of her fingers against his tongue, still so fragrant with her juices. He closed his eyes briefly and sucked, then nipped at them.</p><p>She pulled him down and kissed him hungrily, biting his lips. She couldn&rsquo;t help it \u2013 she had wanted to do it since they first met. He gasped with the pain of it, but he didn&rsquo;t stop. \u00a0She tasted iron and it maddened her. She sucked on his bruised lip and their hips ground against each other, his cock seeming to get harder. She could blossom with him.</p><p>He would not be frightened by the sharp corners of her.</p><p>She looked into his eyes, and for the first time dared to really let him look in hers. She smiled, finally feeling herself entirely in the fuck. Her hands moved to his hips, then his ass. She cupped, then clawed, unconsciously. </p><p>\u201cCome to bed with me,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cDo we need to move?\u201d she said. Her thighs squeezed tight around his hips.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make love here,\u201d he said, stilling.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve fooled me,\u201d she said, grabbing a handful of his hair. But his eyes shimmered again.</p><p>\u201cI want you in my bed. I want to smell you in my sheets in morning, after you\u2019re gone.\u201d </p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond to it. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I did that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe can kiss,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>She wiped his cuntwet chin. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You want more.\u201d She squeezed her muscles around him, and he shivered.</p><p>\u201cI want everything. But if kissing\u2019s all I can get, I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He said that, while fully inside her. But she knew what he meant. He wanted intimacy more than sex. He wanted <i>her</i>.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really do that,\u201d she said. She squirmed underneath him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t really do this,\u201d he said, and withdrew.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d she said softly, reaching out to him. He held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cCome. Let me show you,\u201d he said, and rose. \u201cIt\u2019s way more comfortable than this shitty sofa.\u201d She laid there and stared at him. He sighed. \u201cYou screamed and yelled for my affection less than three hours ago. Have you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>She draped her shirt over herself. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think it would mean anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had much luck in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means the world to me,\u201d he said, his hand still extended. \u201cBut what do the words matter if you don\u2019t trust me?\u201d He chuckled. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said as she rose. Her hip joints creaked with his previous passion.</p><p>\u201cYou said love,\u201d he said. </p><p>She gave him a long look, but he was pleased to see that she didn\u2019t start dressing. </p><p>\u201cI mean, in general,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. She put her hand in his, and he guided her to his room. It was spare, but his bed was large and cozy.</p><p>\u201cSorry it\u2019s so empty,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no good at interior design,\u201d he said, and pulled back his comforter. She noticed a pile of books on the nightstand, and a box filled with picture frames in the corner by the door. She saw another glossy photo, this time of a tropical locale. He kicked the box into the closet and slammed it shut. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to get rid of those. They\u2019re dated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said, eyeing the bed. It looked so inviting. He sat down and patted the place beside him.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said. The sodium lights filtered through his blinds and lit his skin golden. She pressed herself against him. </p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust sit?\u201d she said, smiling into his hair.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you like. We can talk. Or kiss. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you want from me?\u201d she said again. She put his hands on her breasts. He squeezed, then kissed between them, near her heart. Her head spun. He yawned, laid back, and put his legs underneath the comforter. Again, he patted the place beside him.</p><p>\u201cCome on. It\u2019s real down. Really nice,\u201d he said. She sat and rubbed the cool sheets.</p><p>\u201cSo, talking?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI want to know everything about you,\u201d he said. He tucked his hands behind his head. The comforter only covered from his knees down. He was still slick from belly to thighs. It was strange, smelling herself mingled with him. But not at all unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cThere really isn\u2019t much to know. Pain doesn\u2019t mean complexity,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then it won\u2019t take so long,\u201d he said, and winked.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou are a master of elegant oversimplification,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d he said, and caressed up her arm. \u201cBut I\u2019m also good at other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she said, giving his a crooked grin.</p><p>\u201cI meant long talks. And cuddling,\u201d he said. </p><p>She lay over the comforter. \u201cCuddling?\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t done that in a while. I might be rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. She touched his chest. His chest hair was damp and silky.\u201cCome.\u201d He pulled her closer, and she lay her head over his heart. </p>",

I wanted to write <b>more</b> than porn, but at the time, I felt it was all I was good at. I didn&rsquo;t feel I had the focus and the creativity to breathe life into a character and give them a compelling story. I subscribed to Netflix out of boredom. I adored Olivia Colman. I avoided Broadchurch for months because I don&rsquo;t like police procedurals (ha! joke&rsquo;s on me) but I couldn&rsquo;t resist more Olivia.

She didn&rsquo;t mean to yell. It was his eyes, so extraordinarily lovely - the very heart of autumn - were impassive, even as she spilled over in his shitty cabinet of a kitchen, trembling and hyperventilating with emotion. He remained hunched over, silent.</p>\n<p>She flexed her hand. Her wrist was numb. She banged it on his counter, making his cups tinkle. She cursed loud enough to make his neighbors stare as she ran back to her car.</p>\n<p>The echo of what she said filled her with an exhilarating dread. He knew now. She laid everything bare. In her passion she hadn&rsquo;t only spoken her feelings for him, but made no secret of the way she felt about the way he lived his life. </p>\n<p>Drama made her ill. She shivered, although sweat beaded her brow. She licked her lip and tasted salt. She couldn&rsquo;t drive like this. She grabbed her bag on the passenger seat, and for some reason, the act finally broke her.</p>\n<p>Her breathless, strangled groans strengthened quickly to howls. She squeezed her bag in her hands, wrung the empty flaccid thing. Her tears were plentiful and fast, and soon the leather was streaked with saltwater. She looked back at the empty passenger seat and her body stiffened. She couldn&rsquo;t do it a second longer. Wait.

In my 20\u2032s, I was one of those bitches who barely watched television, didn\u2019t read comic books or stan actors/actresses, and only watched sometimes irritating, ridiculous indie films for the \u201cbrilliant photography\u201d. Artsy Hipster trash.<br></p><p>I wrote for another popular blog - OC erotica - but I was miserable and uninspired. I was beyond writing just hanky-panky. I wanted to write <b>more</b> than porn, but at the time, I felt it was all I was good at. I didn\u2019t feel I had the focus and the creativity to breathe life into a character and give them a compelling story. I subscribed to Netflix out of boredom. I adored Olivia Colman. I avoided Broadchurch for months because I don\u2019t like police procedurals (ha! joke\u2019s on me) but I couldn\u2019t resist more Olivia. Enter Hardy.<i> I was bested.</i> I wrote this, left it alone in shame since I DON\u2019T DO FAN FICTION WTF EWW IT\u2019S SO EMBARRASSING UGH -</p><p>[I\u2019m really putting myself out there. Please forgive my blindness.]</p><p>But I had to come back to it a few months later. I had to finish it. For years and years, all this *waving at the beautiful madness* went over my head. Then, I saw David. Oop! It had to happen sometime. Here I am.</p><p>And here it is.</p><hr><p>Her heart hammered in her ears.<b><br></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"441\" data-orig-width=\"441\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dr-10-rainwaters:JcQJ2STE5lKjoU9OJ8bEbw:ZQ4Kwh2F72MC3\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b0925c31f4cf4b9394cba5a2f430fe1/tumblr_oh5mu4oWtH1v8e12no1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"441\" data-orig-width=\"441\"></figure><p>She yelled. She didn\u2019t mean to yell. It was his eyes, so extraordinarily lovely - the very heart of autumn - were impassive, even as she spilled over in his shitty cabinet of a kitchen, trembling and hyperventilating with emotion. He remained hunched over, silent.</p><p>She flexed her hand. Her wrist was numb. She banged it on his counter, making his cups tinkle. She cursed loud enough to make his neighbors stare as she ran back to her car.</p><p>The echo of what she said filled her with an exhilarating dread. He knew now. She laid everything bare. In her passion she hadn\u2019t only spoken her feelings for him, but made no secret of the way she felt about the way he lived his life. </p><p>Drama made her ill. She shivered, although sweat beaded her brow. She licked her lip and tasted salt. She couldn\u2019t drive like this. She grabbed her bag on the passenger seat, and for some reason, the act finally broke her.</p><p>Her breathless, strangled groans strengthened quickly to howls. She squeezed her bag in her hands, wrung the empty flaccid thing. Her tears were plentiful and fast, and soon the leather was streaked with saltwater. She looked back at the empty passenger seat and her body stiffened. She couldn\u2019t do it a second longer. Wait. Endure.</p><p>She opened the door to run.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d She nearly knocked him over.</p><p>She wiped her eyes violently. \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d She slammed the door and started down the entrance of his courtyard.

She wanted to run into his arms, hug him, begin memorizing his limbs. Instead, she sat by him. He was silent for a full minute, looking down at his tented fingers. She looked at his hands too, empty, sifting the light. She waited. She could exist there forever, in that silence. It crackled. </p><p>\u201cTrouble,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He woke her from her day dream.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I saw you. You were none too kind,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe met at an awkward time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you thought I was here to micromanage you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. You did, for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble. Why?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou. It was what I thought the first time I saw you.\u201d He smiled down at his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re right, though. We did meet at an awkward time.\u201d</p><p>She had pieced together the two sentence story in the course of their year working together. </p><p>His wife cheated, then left. He was heartbroken. The end. Her story had more to it, but she had slowly discovered that it was no more heavy.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I\u2019m sorry for the outburst-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d </p><p>Her corners of her mouth turned up.</p><p>\u201cShe told me I drove her mad with my silences. She got frustrated and screamed like you. Banged around. Said she had to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded, but she waited.</p><p>\u201cAt first we laughed it of, made love and that would be the end of it. But eventually, she stopped trying. To fill the silences.\u201d</p><p>His hands were now fists at his knees. The light shone through his beard. The hair was golden, auburn, brown, and not thick enough to hide his jumping pulse. She wanted to touch him, but didn\u2019t. It was petulant.</p><p>\u201cThen, she was quieter than I was. Even when I found out, she was quiet. No excuse. No apology. Just a shrug, then silence. If I\u2019d known it was so horrifying, \u00a0I would\u2019ve tried-\u201d</p><p>He trembled beside her, then he was weeping. It was so sudden and intense she stared for a bit. His face was a grimace, his bottom lip trembling. His sobs were desperate, sloppy. His pain was completely on the surface. She touched him, finally, two fingers on his cheek. Questioning. The heat of his tears made her nipples harden. </p><p>He leaned into her and wrapped his arms around her waist. He buried his head in her breast and she was in it now. Her sternum vibrated with his pain. He squeezed hard, gasped into her neck. His beard scratched at her saltsore skin. She had been angry before. He had made her feel like an echo. But there was more to him than what she thought. Her own tears soon wet his hair. She didn\u2019t weep, though. She didn\u2019t dare take that from him. </p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long they sat that way. His grip on her did not loosen. The front of her blouse stuck to her breasts with tears, saliva and his condensed breath but she was still. Even if he just shared his pain with her, it was something, and she would cherish it.</p><p>His sobs quieted to an occasional hiccup, but he did not raise his head. She scratched the short hairs at the back of his neck, took in the scent of his hair. Her body must\u2019ve reacted because he finally looked at her. His brown eyes were luminous with feeling. After a year of inscrutability, it made her gasp.</p><p>He took her in his arms, kissed her temple.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t quite know how or why I did it. Just two months ago she stood in the same place you did. She loves me, she said. Misses me. I cried, hard, for her. Many nights, but not in a while. It\u2019s like she knew.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened again, but he rubbed her back. </p><p>\u201cShe told me what I fantasized about \u2013 that she had made a huge mistake, that he wasn\u2019t what she thought he was. That maybe my silences weren\u2019t that bad after all-\u201d he wheezed. She supposed it was meant to be a snort. \u201c-and that she wanted me to come home.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved slowly up her spine to squeeze the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cAs I looked at her, I finally figured out how she was different. Physically, she hadn\u2019t changed. Not really. Same hair, same skin, same scent. But she was \u2026 uh, smaller. She no longer took up all the air in the room.\u201d</p><p>He was looking out the window into the dark. \u201cShe knew, then. I didn\u2019t have to say a word. Despite all her complaints about my illegibility, she knew me well enough.\u201d His eyes were those of a man waking from a bad dream. He turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou. You called me a goddamn asshole.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks tingled. \u201cYou \u2026 saw me spinning out and didn\u2019t react. Your face was illegible. Illegible, ha! I was pissed. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh\u2026\u201d a smiled played on his lips. She raised an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was stone-faced because I wanted to smile, but I knew if I did, you might kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile?\u201d She tucked his damp hair behind his ear. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He let her go, reluctantly enough to make her sigh. She was quickly getting used to his touch. He rummaged in his desk, pulling at drawers that creaked.</p><p>\u201cJesus, why do you have that old thing?\u201d She walked over and traced the scratched surface.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my lucky desk. Been with me all my life, I\u2019m never getting rid of it.\u201d </p><p>There was a box of various awards in the corner. \u201cOoh. Shiny things.\u201d He walked into the dark alcove of his bedroom, muttering to himself.</p><p>She rummaged. His name, then \u201cEditor of the Year\u201d etched into\u00a0 a glass block. Parchment. Metal. She picked up a diploma. Cornell University. Master\u2019s in Journalism. She blew the dust off.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you hung this up in your office? Lord knows it cost enough.\u201d There was no response.</p><p>There was a black and white photo at the bottom of the box, dustiest of all. A woman and a man kissing in bed. The Eiffel Tower twinkled in the distance, perfectly centered. It was a postcard.</p><p>She hesitated, then picked it up and wiped the dust off. He was young and beautiful, his long lean body naked above the waist. There were no lines at the corners of his closed eyes, no gray in the temples. There was a smile on the woman\u2019s mouth. Her brow was pale and smooth \u2013 she was worried about how the photo would come out, not about the kiss. She unconsciously traced the curve of his back, making a line on the dusty glass.</p><p>\u201cFound it!\u201d He snatched the photo frame away and replaced it with something. It was an old composition book \u2013 the kind with the black and white pattern on the cover. She giggled.</p><p>\u201cGood lord, I haven\u2019t seen one of these since middle school!\u201d She opened it and saw a trimmed printout stapled to the page. A news article. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the sofa and began to riffle through the pages. There were printouts from papers in Los Angeles, Houston, Boston, New York. His spidery handwriting littered all the empty spaces, spilling onto the lined pages. She kept flipping. Phoenix, Miami. He sat and leaned into her. The weight and scent of him distracted her. She stared at him as he looked for something in the pages.</p><p>\u201cHere. Look.\u201d She wanted to kiss him, but didn\u2019t act on it. Perhaps her outburst had knocked something loose in him \u2013 nothing more. His eyes twinkled. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d She brought the book closer to her face. It was an old article from when she was a Dear Abbie-type columnist for a local paper in Connecticut. She flipped the page. There was more, marked up like the others. There were underlined bits, and many exclamation marks.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare read the notations, for fear of ruining the moment. He was ruthless with a pen. That\u2019s why they called him Zorro.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife \u2013 my ex-wife. She\u2019s from there, and most of her family still lives there. She has a subscription to feel a bit closer to them, know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.\u201cWhy all the articles?\u201d</p><p>He took the book from her. \u201cI was searching. I had grown bored in LA, and I wanted something new. These are the best and brightest I could find from around the States,\u201d he said, rifling through the pages. He stopped at Houston. \u201cShe figured out the connection between Mexican vegetables and the Mob \u2013 nearly got herself killed. She\u2019s still under police protection.\u201d</p><p>He flipped to Miami. \u201cThis kid wrote a police corruption article that got the commissioner fired. Just 23 years old he was,\u201d he smiled and shook his head. \u201cGood stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wrote witty responses to housewives and teenagers.\u201d She wasn\u2019t cowed, but she was curious. How did she fit in then, or even now? She was a lowly staff writer. Frankly, before he was there to make her mad, she had been miserable. She had been about to quit and go back to school for literature when he came \u2013 had even put in the transfer request at her old university. One look, and school was forgotten.</p><p>He closed the book. \u201cOne evening my wife was laughing, loud \u2013 a rare sound in our house by that time - and I was curious. She sent me the link. In ten minutes, I had the first printout stapled to the journal.\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t understand the link. She shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re really, really good. Has anyone told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what? Regurgitating press releases? By your savage editing, I would think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind that,\u201d he dismissed her comment. \u201cYou\u2019re a very good writer. Brilliant, if you\u2019re not writing about the latest murder or terrorist act.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him.\u201cSo I\u2019m mediocre at my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes widened. He was usually very frank, but considering what had just happened, it was a bit much.</p><p>He noticed. \u201cNo. Well, sort of. Let me explain. You have no peer that I know of in painting a picture in words, but it must be <i>your</i> picture. You\u2019re not the best copy machine, so to speak. Your boredom bleeds through and stains it.\u201d He spoke with his hands when he was excited, and he did then, wriggling his fingers in feigned disgust.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what was happening. She had cried. Then he had cried. And now she was \u2026 boring? She couldn\u2019t process where the evening was headed. Her eyes still felt gritty from crying. His tears and sweat were making her breasts itch.</p><p>\u201cYour wife\u2019s family is from Greenwich?\u201d It was all she could think to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She read the paper daily. Eventually, so did I. At least, your bit. Until you announced you were moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d </p><p>He looked at her, expecting more. She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cUh, and when I saw that, I was curious as to who you were and whether you were moving to another paper or moving on literally. Quitting. It put a fire under my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife knows the editor in chief \u2013 \u00a0they went to school together, you know, and she did me the favor of asking about you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. He smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cStalker.\u201d It was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cAdmirer. Fan.\u201d</p><p>Now she was dizzy. \u201cBut, how exactly? You were there, not two months after I started. As far as I know, the editor before you wasn\u2019t going to retire for several years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the owner saw my dusty box of awards, she gave him an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse. And I was in.\u201d He picked at a ragged corner of the journal. \u201cIt was during that time that my wife left me. During the move.\u201d</p><p>The first time they met he was dour-faced and rumpled. She figured it was stress. But he was freshly wounded.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He was timid with his revelation.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know me. Why? What if I had been \u2026 I don\u2019t know, a pseudonym for a gay man? A 60 year old woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Doesn\u2019t take away from your brilliance. I was ready for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I knew you were trouble from the moment you walked into my office with your printed scarf and your hair curling all around your face. You were so earnest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause you were hurt. I could feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was illegible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t blinded then. We were bickering in minutes.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cYou are infuriating at times. Need a filter installed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the pot to the kettle.\u201d He was right. The atmosphere became suddenly heavy, and it took effort not to lean over and put her mouth on his. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the kettle right? You\u2019ve got the spout.\u201d She wiggled her pinkie finger. </p><p>He wrapped his fingers around it, stilling her. \u201dWhat are you trying to say?\u201d His breath was sweet and warm on her cheek. Honeyed. The juvenile silliness of the sentiment made her giggle. He thought she was a good writer.</p><p>\u201cMediocre, yet brilliant,\u201d she said out loud.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex-wife. She\u2019s a famous photographer?\u201d </p><p>He was perplexed, but he responded. \u201cYes.\u201d She blinked slowly, waited. \u201cWe met in college. I was editor of the paper. She wasn\u2019t famous yet, but promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s brave. That spread on Aleppo for Time was amazing.\u201d And it was.</p><p>\u201cNot brave enough,\u201d he said, and stood up abruptly. \u201cWant a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What d'you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBourbon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll have it neat.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow and reached for the bottle on the shelf. She had never had the opportunity to observe him like she wanted to, but it was late and he was pouring her whiskey. She didn\u2019t care anymore. </p><p>He was lean, and tall. He sometimes didn\u2019t wear an undershirt, so there were peeks of skin between the buttons when he stood or sat a certain way. It had been driving her mad for months. When she was touching herself she was bold in her thoughts and she fantasized of straddling him, slowly taking off his wire rims and sliding a finger slowly in and out of the gaps, caressing the furry flesh of his chest with her knuckles until his eyes gave her permission. She would slide off his lap to the floor and bite the buttons off, not rip. She wanted to feel the slight pain of it in her teeth, have the perverse pleasure of spitting each one out. She would lick the sweat that beaded on his taut belly, rip his zipper open- </p><p>The glasses tinkled in his hand.</p><p>It made her blush to think that she didn\u2019t want to care about his pleasure. She wanted to use only her mouth on him, take deep breaths of the secret scent trapped in his pubic hair, feel herself throb and trickle down her thighs. She would take his cock in her mouth, deep enough to make her throat contract, her hands claws at his narrow hips. She moaned at the deep red half moons her nails would leave. She would suck him so deep when he finally came and he withdrew there would be no semen dripping on her chin, just her hungry spittle.</p><p>She would finish herself off then, her clit a solid, pulsing thing, not just a button but the whole of her hips, with the taste and scent of his musk deep in her head-</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he said. She sighed shakily. He handed her the glass and she drank it down in two gulps, trying to kill the fire in her belly. She was wet. She wondered whether she had soaked through her jeans. She shook the glass. He poured her another, amused.</p><p>\u201cI thought you rarely drank.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Now</i>. There was once a time where I could drink \u2013 excuse my expression \u2013 an Irish Catholic under the table. I stopped for very vain reasons.\u201d She drank again, and only then did she feel the faraway burn of the liquor. It was a pale facsimile to her own heat.</p><p>\u201cVain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It dries out my beautiful skin,\u201d She gave him a crooked grin. She hadn\u2019t eaten much, so it was working fast.</p><p>He shot his, and she looked again. He sat, spread legged and barefoot. He was full, heavy between his legs. She was pointlessly empty and aching between hers. She gasped she wanted to touch him so much. It unnerved her.</p><p>She licked an amber drop from the rim of the glass. \u00a0\u201cI know why she chose you.\u201d She stood up, walked to his desk again, looked through his box and lifted out a photo with his old school newspaper staff. \u00a0He was in the middle with his arms slung around another young man. Tall, almost wispy, but everyone\u2019s eyes were on him. He was luminous, his smile a wonder. </p><p>He walked behind her. She put the photo back into the box. \u201cShe\u2019s got a brilliant eye.\u201d</p><p>She poured herself another drink. He looked bashful, almost.</p><p>\u201cYou chose each other, but soon after you married, you realized she chose you for the wrong reason. You hoped it would be because you were promising, talented, but nope.\u201d</p><p>She was spinning out again. She was on hormones and liquor, and naturally self-destructive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. You try to hide it behind wire rims and cheap suits, but you are. So. Fucking. Beautiful. And it\u2019s not just physical, but your very being is maddening. You make grown women want to rock back in forth in the fetal position, holding themselves. That\u2019s why you overcompensate with the nice. Sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, bemused.</p><p>\u201cShe was a treasure to you, the whole package, but you \u2026 you are a prize.\u201d She pointed at him with the glass.</p><p>He reacted, became rigid. She giggled at the irony of it, even though she knew it hurt. It was reckless.</p><p>She drank slow. \u201c\u2026A shallow thing. Even with the gray and the lines you are. Better even, flavored with experience, and heartbreak.\u201d She exaggerated the \u2018k\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s why she wanted to get her teeth back into you. You\u2019re a whole new flavor now.\u201d</p><p>As ever, she drank too much, too fast. The prospect of killing her constant pain made it impossible to ever be responsible with drugs. She caressed the bottle, appreciated the fact he wasn\u2019t so foolish as to take it from her.</p><p>\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve always had a talent for cutting through to the truth,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPity I\u2019m a mediocre journalist, then.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face, sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about that,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you keep mentioning it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so \u2026 ingenuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m brilliant.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019m paid very well because I\u2019m fucking good at knowing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. You used the word fuck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is happening? Why are you like this? Again, if I said something to upset you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, god dammit.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes shimmered.\u201cI know why you\u2019re doing this, so stop.\u201d He took her in his arms. \u201cI know.\u201d He took a deep breath in her hair. She smelled of whiskey and sweat. She untangled herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know? Your life was perfect. Good family. Good schools. Beautiful wife.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas. Apt choice of words. And yes, I know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d She felt out of control again. \u201cI should go home.\u201d He didn\u2019t physically try to stop her. She didn\u2019t know whether to be relieved or hurt.</p><p>\u201cSomeone stole you, and you\u2019re just trying to protect what\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>Her face twisted with emotion. \u201c'Protect what\u2019s left\u2019? Who told you that?\u201d Tears leaked out of the corners of her eyes. He took a step toward her, hand out to touch. </p><p>\u201cYou can dish it out, but you can\u2019t take it?\u201d His jaw muscles tightened underneath his beard. She hated herself.</p><p>\u201cNo one did. No, you did. In your work.\u201d He tried to hug her, but she pushed him away. He stood for several seconds, arms extended, his eyes tender.</p><p>\u201cYou want to save me? Make the boo boo all better?\u201d She was on her last wind. If it didn\u2019t put him off, she wouldn\u2019t have strength to run again. Her heart roared in her ears. Her chest hurt with tears she had not cried because no one would care about them, or about her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. It was quiet. He sat down. She gasped, sucked up an errant sob.\u201cI can\u2019t pretend to know about the depth and breadth of your pain, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to save you, you\u2019re a grown woman. I just \u2026 want you. All the time. Every day. Every hour. The scent and savor, your breath, your words. I want to feel the pain with you. I want to love it out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d She can\u2019t believe what she had heard, but her mouth spoke before thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd? Worthwhile things never are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA silly platitude.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBased on a very serious truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2026 worth all that.\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed. It made her jump.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what\u2019s so fucking funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just show you?\u201d He pointed to the journal. \u201cI know you\u2019re hurting, but are you being willfully obtuse?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI moved across the country to get a glimpse of you! My wife wasn\u2019t happy about it. She loves L.A. East Coast sensibilities never suited her. That\u2019s a quote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mediocre, and dense. Why don\u2019t you go three for three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck it. You\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but it was brassy. Fake. His eyes were alight with anger, and even then, he was lovely. She would lose him and spend her life wondering what he saw in her. It was a peacock chasing a nightingale.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d He was breathless. She hadn\u2019t realized she had spoken out loud. He walked into his bedroom and threw something on the desk. It was a well worn proof, a slim book with no cover. The pages were curling on the edges with love. She picked it up and looked at it. She knew what it was before opening it.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this? It didn\u2019t make it to print.\u201d </p><p>He plucked it from her hands and looked through it with a familiarity that made her feel instantly guilty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my people.\u201d He cleared his throat and read from a dog-eared page:</p><p><i>She didn\u2019t dare tell anyone how much love confounded her. She hated the feeling of floating. Being out of control, blinded by her desire, irritated her to no end. She had been alone for a long time, by choice. Her sight had been crystal clear to observe others floating, while she was mercifully weighted down to earth by her pain.</i></p><p>She leaned on the desk, silent.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you refuse to publish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know everything about me. Give it a guess.\u201d She couldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to guess. It's\u2026 when I found out and spoke to Harriman, he was completely perplexed. Said you sent the check back in full and told him to get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I would sue if he published.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou signed a contract. Technically, they had a right to publish. He told me you fired your agent and showed up at his door, begged until he agreed to tear it up. He felt sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were scared. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be long-winded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He guided her to the sofa, sat her down.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger and still lived at home, I used to nick all the books my sisters got from school and read them - if I hadn\u2019t already. They invariably came to me for help with essays and things, so it was just a smart thing to do, it saved time. One of them came home with The Bell Jar. Before then, I\u2019d only had very limited experience with Sylvia Plath. I don\u2019t have much patience for poetry, since it picks at my scabs, so to speak. Anyway, I read it and it frightened me. It\u2019s the only book that I couldn\u2019t finish reading. I couldn\u2019t help her with her essay. She got a dismal grade and hated me for a bit.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his, rubbed his lips against her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cShe wore her pain so openly. It\u2019s obscene. I don\u2019t want that, but I don\u2019t know how else to express myself. Why should I let it go public? Spreading it around doesn\u2019t necessarily lessen it. I don\u2019t want strangers pining indulgently with my pain. It\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a wonder,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDaniel\u2026\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple again, sweetly. It was a theme with him. She wanted to let go, turn her head, but muscle memory won.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am. I\u2019m no treasure. When I want to caress, I maul. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know who you are then. And I\u2019m willing to bleed a little to find out.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSilly man. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking. I live on that shed blood. And you\u2019re a thin one. Might not last too long.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to be funny, but it came off grim.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever worked so hard to get a woman to kiss me.\u201d He rubbed his lips against her cheekbone, his arms going around her waist.</p><p>\u201cAfter all that, you still want me?\u201d She felt emotionally overstretched. She wondered what time it was. Even the crickets were silent.</p><p>\u201cI am singularly concerned with what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t conceive of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I couldn\u2019t read that look earlier?\u201d</p><p>She was amused.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of what I do. Read between the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhuh. And?\u201d Her voice was shaky, despite herself.</p><p>\u201cYou said I was beautiful. No woman\u2019s called me that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. Impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not one. I\u2019ve been called hot. Sexy, or handsome. Never beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It makes the sentiment ours alone. You think I\u2019m beautiful. It\u2019s glorious.\u201d He giggled. He was so close his lashes tickled her. The roof of her mouth tingled like it did whenever she craved kisses. He kissed her cheek, then her jaw, and moved down. He squeezed her knee, then slowly pulled her legs open. She looked down, then closed her legs quickly.</p><p>She had soaked through her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhy so shy?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m tired, Daniel. It\u2019s been a weird night. I should go home.\u201d She was coming down off her whiskey high. She had exposed too much of herself.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d He slid off the sofa. He was on his knees in front of her. He spread her thighs again and looked at the wet spot. His eyes moved from between her legs to her flat belly, then up to her breasts. Her nipples hardened again. </p><p>\u201cTell me, then. What was I thinking?\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled at her, a slow smile that narrowed his eyes and relaxed his shoulders. It took her breath away. He leaned in for a kiss. She closed her eyes and parted her lips, conquered. She felt his mouth on her cunt instead. He breathed her in deeply, eyes closed, as his fingers found her fly. He pulled her jeans down with her panties. There were welts on her hips he was so forceful. She was sodden, an obscene pink that betrayed her. He pulled at her buttons, lost patience, then pulled the shirt over her head. He pulled her bra over her head, too impatient to unhook. She was naked except for her socks. He pulled them off, then bit the concave of her arches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said. He placed her legs over his shoulders, rubbed his prickly cheeks on her inner thighs. He couldn\u2019t kiss for licking. \u201cI\u2019m completely naked, and you\u2019re fully dressed.\u201d She ran her fingers through his thick hair. He sighed into her. It was delicious. He stopped and pulled his tie around so it hung down his back and placed it in her hand.</p><p>\u201cTry and stop me if you like.\u201d He spread her inner lips open with his tongue, licked from her opening to the base of her clit\u2026then bit. Not hard, but to push back the hood and steady her swollen bud to lick hungry circles into it.</p><p>She cursed and pulled, but he fought her. He squeezed both breasts, tugged at her nipples to the point of pain. She was suddenly scared. She had no anonymity with him like she had with the men she carefully picked online. She could play a part with them. \u00a0But not with Dan. If he made her come, she wouldn\u2019t be able to bounce away unscathed. Like a stray kitten, if he fed her, she\u2019d be back for his milk every day. She knew it.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Stop.\u201d She pulled on his tie. He buried the bottom of his face in her even deeper, though he was getting red from lack of breath. His fingers trailed red down her ribcage to her hips.</p><p>He began to suck on her. It was a hard, quick rhythm that made her pant, and she lost the strength to tug. He groaned into her, pushing her legs together against his face. He wanted to be surrounded by her, hidden away. He had fallen completely in love with her brittle strength, and was drugged by her fragility. He would break her and then help her put herself back together. He hoped she would let him. </p><p>Break her. The thought made him moan, long and rough, into her cunt. He wanted her all to himself. He was more hurt that he let on by her hesitation. </p><p>He stopped and unbuckled his belt, pulled down his underwear. Her eyes were wide and shiny, her mouth swollen although it was \u00a0unkissed. He resisted the urge and squeezed himself, gasping at the ache at the slightest touch of his fingers. Her lips formed into a moist O as he slid into her. It wasn\u2019t slow, or gentle. He pressed her thighs apart and fucked her hard and deep. He rocked her frame with each thrust, but she didn\u2019t moan or gasp. Her eyes rolled closed and she turned her face away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare. Look at me.\u201d He wrapped his hands around her waist, wondering at the tautness of her muscles. She opened her eyes. Her tongue was a glossy rose that made his balls tighten. But she didn\u2019t turn her head.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d She spread her legs wider and sighed. It was odd she didn\u2019t touch him. Cruel.</p><p>He took her hand, laced his fingers through hers and placed it above her head. She finally met his gaze. As soon as she did, she let out moan and curled into herself. She squeezed painfully around him but he fucked through it, ecstatic with her sudden warmth. He leaned into her and she caressed his face. She slid two fingers in his panting mouth, rubbed the pads of her fingers against his tongue, still so fragrant with her juices. He closed his eyes briefly and sucked, then nipped at them.</p><p>She pulled him down and kissed him hungrily, biting his lips. She couldn\u2019t help it \u2013 she had wanted to do it since they first met. He gasped with the pain of it, but he didn\u2019t stop. \u00a0She tasted iron and it maddened her. She sucked on his bruised lip and their hips ground against each other, his cock seeming to get harder. She could blossom with him.</p><p>He would not be frightened by the sharp corners of her.</p><p>She looked into his eyes, and for the first time dared to really let him look in hers. She smiled, finally feeling herself entirely in the fuck. Her hands moved to his hips, then his ass. She cupped, then clawed, unconsciously. </p><p>\u201cCome to bed with me,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cDo we need to move?\u201d she said. Her thighs squeezed tight around his hips.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make love here,\u201d he said, stilling.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve fooled me,\u201d she said, grabbing a handful of his hair. But his eyes shimmered again.</p><p>\u201cI want you in my bed. I want to smell you in my sheets in morning, after you\u2019re gone.\u201d </p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond to it. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I did that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe can kiss,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>She wiped his cuntwet chin. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You want more.\u201d She squeezed her muscles around him, and he shivered.</p><p>\u201cI want everything. But if kissing\u2019s all I can get, I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He said that, while fully inside her. But she knew what he meant. He wanted intimacy more than sex. He wanted <i>her</i>.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really do that,\u201d she said. She squirmed underneath him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t really do this,\u201d he said, and withdrew.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d she said softly, reaching out to him. He held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cCome. Let me show you,\u201d he said, and rose. \u201cIt\u2019s way more comfortable than this shitty sofa.\u201d She laid there and stared at him. He sighed. \u201cYou screamed and yelled for my affection less than three hours ago. Have you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>She draped her shirt over herself. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think it would mean anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had much luck in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means the world to me,\u201d he said, his hand still extended. \u201cBut what do the words matter if you don\u2019t trust me?\u201d He chuckled. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said as she rose. Her hip joints creaked with his previous passion.</p><p>\u201cYou said love,\u201d he said. </p><p>She gave him a long look, but he was pleased to see that she didn\u2019t start dressing. </p><p>\u201cI mean, in general,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. She put her hand in his, and he guided her to his room. It was spare, but his bed was large and cozy.</p><p>\u201cSorry it\u2019s so empty,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no good at interior design,\u201d he said, and pulled back his comforter. She noticed a pile of books on the nightstand, and a box filled with picture frames in the corner by the door. She saw another glossy photo, this time of a tropical locale. He kicked the box into the closet and slammed it shut. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to get rid of those. They\u2019re dated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said, eyeing the bed. It looked so inviting. He sat down and patted the place beside him.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said. The sodium lights filtered through his blinds and lit his skin golden. She pressed herself against him. </p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust sit?\u201d she said, smiling into his hair.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you like. We can talk. Or kiss. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you want from me?\u201d she said again. She put his hands on her breasts. He squeezed, then kissed between them, near her heart. Her head spun. He yawned, laid back, and put his legs underneath the comforter. Again, he patted the place beside him.</p><p>\u201cCome on. It\u2019s real down. Really nice,\u201d he said. She sat and rubbed the cool sheets.</p><p>\u201cSo, talking?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI want to know everything about you,\u201d he said. He tucked his hands behind his head. The comforter only covered from his knees down. He was still slick from belly to thighs. It was strange, smelling herself mingled with him. But not at all unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cThere really isn\u2019t much to know. Pain doesn\u2019t mean complexity,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then it won\u2019t take so long,\u201d he said, and winked.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou are a master of elegant oversimplification,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d he said, and caressed up her arm. \u201cBut I\u2019m also good at other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she said, giving his a crooked grin.</p><p>\u201cI meant long talks. And cuddling,\u201d he said. </p><p>She lay over the comforter. \u201cCuddling?\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t done that in a while. I might be rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. She touched his chest. His chest hair was damp and silky.\u201cCome.\u201d He pulled her closer, and she lay her head over his heart. </p>",

In my 20\u2032s, I was one of those bitches who barely watched television, didn\u2019t read comic books or stan actors/actresses, and only watched sometimes irritating, ridiculous indie films for the \u201cbrilliant photography\u201d. Artsy Hipster trash.<br></p><p>I wrote for another popular blog - OC erotica - but I was miserable and uninspired. I was beyond writing just hanky-panky. I wanted to write <b>more</b> than porn, but at the time, I felt it was all I was good at. I didn\u2019t feel I had the focus and the creativity to breathe life into a character and give them a compelling story. I subscribed to Netflix out of boredom. I adored Olivia Colman. I avoided Broadchurch for months because I don\u2019t like police procedurals (ha! joke\u2019s on me) but I couldn\u2019t resist more Olivia. Enter Hardy.<i> I was bested.</i> I wrote this, left it alone in shame since I DON\u2019T DO FAN FICTION WTF EWW IT\u2019S SO EMBARRASSING UGH -</p><p>[I\u2019m really putting myself out there. Please forgive my blindness.]</p><p>But I had to come back to it a few months later. I had to finish it. For years and years, all this *waving at the beautiful madness* went over my head. Then, I saw David. Oop! It had to happen sometime. Here I am.</p><p>And here it is.</p><hr><p>Her heart hammered in her ears.<b><br></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"441\" data-orig-width=\"441\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dr-10-rainwaters:JcQJ2STE5lKjoU9OJ8bEbw:ZQ4Kwh2F72MC3\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b0925c31f4cf4b9394cba5a2f430fe1/tumblr_oh5mu4oWtH1v8e12no1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"441\" data-orig-width=\"441\"></figure><p>She yelled. She didn\u2019t mean to yell. It was his eyes, so extraordinarily lovely - the very heart of autumn - were impassive, even as she spilled over in his shitty cabinet of a kitchen, trembling and hyperventilating with emotion. He remained hunched over, silent.</p><p>She flexed her hand. Her wrist was numb. She banged it on his counter, making his cups tinkle. She cursed loud enough to make his neighbors stare as she ran back to her car.</p><p>The echo of what she said filled her with an exhilarating dread. He knew now. She laid everything bare. In her passion she hadn\u2019t only spoken her feelings for him, but made no secret of the way she felt about the way he lived his life. </p><p>Drama made her ill. She shivered, although sweat beaded her brow. She licked her lip and tasted salt. She couldn\u2019t drive like this. She grabbed her bag on the passenger seat, and for some reason, the act finally broke her.</p><p>Her breathless, strangled groans strengthened quickly to howls. She squeezed her bag in her hands, wrung the empty flaccid thing. Her tears were plentiful and fast, and soon the leather was streaked with saltwater. She looked back at the empty passenger seat and her body stiffened. She couldn\u2019t do it a second longer. Wait. Endure.</p><p>She opened the door to run.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d She nearly knocked him over.</p><p>She wiped her eyes violently. \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d She slammed the door and started down the entrance of his courtyard. The sodium lights made his brown hair flash auburn. </p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She kept walking. Her cheeks stung. \u201cYou can\u2019t go anywhere in that condition. Come inside. I\u2019ll make you a cup of tea.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She stopped walking, but didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. She heard the gravel under his heels, the slight hitch a back injury has caused.</p><p>She looked down at her waterlogged bag, then at the road. She followed him back to his cottage. He closed the door behind her, his delicate hands overly precious on the deadlock. She had wanted, and wondered at his hands. </p><p>Now he knew.</p><p>He walked to the kitchen, ducking his head on the glass fixture that hung too low. It swung softly as he made her favorite. He had made it many times - it was a thoughtless exercise. She ached, but still drank in his silence. The vertical lines between his eyes were deep. His hands were steady, pouring and stirring. The thought of his pity, of a kindness rendered to a friend in pain, made her mouth fill with saliva. She hiccuped.</p><p>He set the cup down in front of her. \u201cDrink.\u201d He adjusted his worn tie. His jaw clenched, but his eyes were soft. She took the cup in her hand, warm ceramic, rounded and comfortable. There was chip on the lip. She rubbed her bottom lip against it.</p><p>\u201cMy neighbor. He said you were crying in your car.\u201d </p><p>She swallowed too deeply, and hissed as it burned down her throat.</p><p>\u201cReally loudly.\u201d His eyes made her hand tremble. She put the cup down. Rolled her sore eyes. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to cause a disturbance.\u201d She meant it. Now that she was empty of passion, her outburst seemed ridiculous. She stood up. \u201cThank you. I\u2026um\u2026think I\u2019m okay to drive now.\u201d She took quick strides to the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I said it was ridiculous display <i>I\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately please forget I ever did it-</i>\u201d Her words tumbled together. She hit the door running, nearly tore the knob off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to forget.\u201d It was barely louder than breath.</p><p>She stopped cold, turned her head to look at him. He stood by his table, lips parted, with expectant eyes. She was punch drunk.</p><p>\u201cCome inside.\u201d He pointed to his sofa. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>She was dangerously close to tears again. She wanted to run into his arms, hug him, begin memorizing his limbs. Instead, she sat by him. He was silent for a full minute, looking down at his tented fingers. She looked at his hands too, empty, sifting the light. She waited. She could exist there forever, in that silence. It crackled. </p><p>\u201cTrouble,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He woke her from her day dream.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I saw you. You were none too kind,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe met at an awkward time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you thought I was here to micromanage you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. You did, for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble. Why?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou. It was what I thought the first time I saw you.\u201d He smiled down at his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re right, though. We did meet at an awkward time.\u201d</p><p>She had pieced together the two sentence story in the course of their year working together. </p><p>His wife cheated, then left. He was heartbroken. The end. Her story had more to it, but she had slowly discovered that it was no more heavy.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I\u2019m sorry for the outburst-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d </p><p>Her corners of her mouth turned up.</p><p>\u201cShe told me I drove her mad with my silences. She got frustrated and screamed like you. Banged around. Said she had to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded, but she waited.</p><p>\u201cAt first we laughed it of, made love and that would be the end of it. But eventually, she stopped trying. To fill the silences.\u201d</p><p>His hands were now fists at his knees. The light shone through his beard. The hair was golden, auburn, brown, and not thick enough to hide his jumping pulse. She wanted to touch him, but didn\u2019t. It was petulant.</p><p>\u201cThen, she was quieter than I was. Even when I found out, she was quiet. No excuse. No apology. Just a shrug, then silence. If I\u2019d known it was so horrifying, \u00a0I would\u2019ve tried-\u201d</p><p>He trembled beside her, then he was weeping. It was so sudden and intense she stared for a bit. His face was a grimace, his bottom lip trembling. His sobs were desperate, sloppy. His pain was completely on the surface. She touched him, finally, two fingers on his cheek. Questioning. The heat of his tears made her nipples harden. </p><p>He leaned into her and wrapped his arms around her waist. He buried his head in her breast and she was in it now. Her sternum vibrated with his pain. He squeezed hard, gasped into her neck. His beard scratched at her saltsore skin. She had been angry before. He had made her feel like an echo. But there was more to him than what she thought. Her own tears soon wet his hair. She didn\u2019t weep, though. She didn\u2019t dare take that from him. </p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long they sat that way. His grip on her did not loosen. The front of her blouse stuck to her breasts with tears, saliva and his condensed breath but she was still. Even if he just shared his pain with her, it was something, and she would cherish it.</p><p>His sobs quieted to an occasional hiccup, but he did not raise his head. She scratched the short hairs at the back of his neck, took in the scent of his hair. Her body must\u2019ve reacted because he finally looked at her. His brown eyes were luminous with feeling. After a year of inscrutability, it made her gasp.</p><p>He took her in his arms, kissed her temple.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t quite know how or why I did it. Just two months ago she stood in the same place you did. She loves me, she said. Misses me. I cried, hard, for her. Many nights, but not in a while. It\u2019s like she knew.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened again, but he rubbed her back. </p><p>\u201cShe told me what I fantasized about \u2013 that she had made a huge mistake, that he wasn\u2019t what she thought he was. That maybe my silences weren\u2019t that bad after all-\u201d he wheezed. She supposed it was meant to be a snort. \u201c-and that she wanted me to come home.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved slowly up her spine to squeeze the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cAs I looked at her, I finally figured out how she was different. Physically, she hadn\u2019t changed. Not really. Same hair, same skin, same scent. But she was \u2026 uh, smaller. She no longer took up all the air in the room.\u201d</p><p>He was looking out the window into the dark. \u201cShe knew, then. I didn\u2019t have to say a word. Despite all her complaints about my illegibility, she knew me well enough.\u201d His eyes were those of a man waking from a bad dream. He turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou. You called me a goddamn asshole.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks tingled. \u201cYou \u2026 saw me spinning out and didn\u2019t react. Your face was illegible. Illegible, ha! I was pissed. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh\u2026\u201d a smiled played on his lips. She raised an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was stone-faced because I wanted to smile, but I knew if I did, you might kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile?\u201d She tucked his damp hair behind his ear. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He let her go, reluctantly enough to make her sigh. She was quickly getting used to his touch. He rummaged in his desk, pulling at drawers that creaked.</p><p>\u201cJesus, why do you have that old thing?\u201d She walked over and traced the scratched surface.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my lucky desk. Been with me all my life, I\u2019m never getting rid of it.\u201d </p><p>There was a box of various awards in the corner. \u201cOoh. Shiny things.\u201d He walked into the dark alcove of his bedroom, muttering to himself.</p><p>She rummaged. His name, then \u201cEditor of the Year\u201d etched into\u00a0 a glass block. Parchment. Metal. She picked up a diploma. Cornell University. Master\u2019s in Journalism. She blew the dust off.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you hung this up in your office? Lord knows it cost enough.\u201d There was no response.</p><p>There was a black and white photo at the bottom of the box, dustiest of all. A woman and a man kissing in bed. The Eiffel Tower twinkled in the distance, perfectly centered. It was a postcard.</p><p>She hesitated, then picked it up and wiped the dust off. He was young and beautiful, his long lean body naked above the waist. There were no lines at the corners of his closed eyes, no gray in the temples. There was a smile on the woman\u2019s mouth. Her brow was pale and smooth \u2013 she was worried about how the photo would come out, not about the kiss. She unconsciously traced the curve of his back, making a line on the dusty glass.</p><p>\u201cFound it!\u201d He snatched the photo frame away and replaced it with something. It was an old composition book \u2013 the kind with the black and white pattern on the cover. She giggled.</p><p>\u201cGood lord, I haven\u2019t seen one of these since middle school!\u201d She opened it and saw a trimmed printout stapled to the page. A news article. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the sofa and began to riffle through the pages. There were printouts from papers in Los Angeles, Houston, Boston, New York. His spidery handwriting littered all the empty spaces, spilling onto the lined pages. She kept flipping. Phoenix, Miami. He sat and leaned into her. The weight and scent of him distracted her. She stared at him as he looked for something in the pages.</p><p>\u201cHere. Look.\u201d She wanted to kiss him, but didn\u2019t act on it. Perhaps her outburst had knocked something loose in him \u2013 nothing more. His eyes twinkled. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d She brought the book closer to her face. It was an old article from when she was a Dear Abbie-type columnist for a local paper in Connecticut. She flipped the page. There was more, marked up like the others. There were underlined bits, and many exclamation marks.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare read the notations, for fear of ruining the moment. He was ruthless with a pen. That\u2019s why they called him Zorro.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife \u2013 my ex-wife. She\u2019s from there, and most of her family still lives there. She has a subscription to feel a bit closer to them, know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.\u201cWhy all the articles?\u201d</p><p>He took the book from her. \u201cI was searching. I had grown bored in LA, and I wanted something new. These are the best and brightest I could find from around the States,\u201d he said, rifling through the pages. He stopped at Houston. \u201cShe figured out the connection between Mexican vegetables and the Mob \u2013 nearly got herself killed. She\u2019s still under police protection.\u201d</p><p>He flipped to Miami. \u201cThis kid wrote a police corruption article that got the commissioner fired. Just 23 years old he was,\u201d he smiled and shook his head. \u201cGood stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wrote witty responses to housewives and teenagers.\u201d She wasn\u2019t cowed, but she was curious. How did she fit in then, or even now? She was a lowly staff writer. Frankly, before he was there to make her mad, she had been miserable. She had been about to quit and go back to school for literature when he came \u2013 had even put in the transfer request at her old university. One look, and school was forgotten.</p><p>He closed the book. \u201cOne evening my wife was laughing, loud \u2013 a rare sound in our house by that time - and I was curious. She sent me the link. In ten minutes, I had the first printout stapled to the journal.\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t understand the link. She shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re really, really good. Has anyone told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what? Regurgitating press releases? By your savage editing, I would think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind that,\u201d he dismissed her comment. \u201cYou\u2019re a very good writer. Brilliant, if you\u2019re not writing about the latest murder or terrorist act.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him.\u201cSo I\u2019m mediocre at my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes widened. He was usually very frank, but considering what had just happened, it was a bit much.</p><p>He noticed. \u201cNo. Well, sort of. Let me explain. You have no peer that I know of in painting a picture in words, but it must be <i>your</i> picture. You\u2019re not the best copy machine, so to speak. Your boredom bleeds through and stains it.\u201d He spoke with his hands when he was excited, and he did then, wriggling his fingers in feigned disgust.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what was happening. She had cried. Then he had cried. And now she was \u2026 boring? She couldn\u2019t process where the evening was headed. Her eyes still felt gritty from crying. His tears and sweat were making her breasts itch.</p><p>\u201cYour wife\u2019s family is from Greenwich?\u201d It was all she could think to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She read the paper daily. Eventually, so did I. At least, your bit. Until you announced you were moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d </p><p>He looked at her, expecting more. She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cUh, and when I saw that, I was curious as to who you were and whether you were moving to another paper or moving on literally. Quitting. It put a fire under my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife knows the editor in chief \u2013 \u00a0they went to school together, you know, and she did me the favor of asking about you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. He smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cStalker.\u201d It was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cAdmirer. Fan.\u201d</p><p>Now she was dizzy. \u201cBut, how exactly? You were there, not two months after I started. As far as I know, the editor before you wasn\u2019t going to retire for several years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the owner saw my dusty box of awards, she gave him an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse. And I was in.\u201d He picked at a ragged corner of the journal. \u201cIt was during that time that my wife left me. During the move.\u201d</p><p>The first time they met he was dour-faced and rumpled. She figured it was stress. But he was freshly wounded.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He was timid with his revelation.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know me. Why? What if I had been \u2026 I don\u2019t know, a pseudonym for a gay man? A 60 year old woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Doesn\u2019t take away from your brilliance. I was ready for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I knew you were trouble from the moment you walked into my office with your printed scarf and your hair curling all around your face. You were so earnest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause you were hurt. I could feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was illegible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t blinded then. We were bickering in minutes.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cYou are infuriating at times. Need a filter installed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the pot to the kettle.\u201d He was right. The atmosphere became suddenly heavy, and it took effort not to lean over and put her mouth on his. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the kettle right? You\u2019ve got the spout.\u201d She wiggled her pinkie finger. </p><p>He wrapped his fingers around it, stilling her. \u201dWhat are you trying to say?\u201d His breath was sweet and warm on her cheek. Honeyed. The juvenile silliness of the sentiment made her giggle. He thought she was a good writer.</p><p>\u201cMediocre, yet brilliant,\u201d she said out loud.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex-wife. She\u2019s a famous photographer?\u201d </p><p>He was perplexed, but he responded. \u201cYes.\u201d She blinked slowly, waited. \u201cWe met in college. I was editor of the paper. She wasn\u2019t famous yet, but promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s brave. That spread on Aleppo for Time was amazing.\u201d And it was.</p><p>\u201cNot brave enough,\u201d he said, and stood up abruptly. \u201cWant a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What d'you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBourbon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll have it neat.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow and reached for the bottle on the shelf. She had never had the opportunity to observe him like she wanted to, but it was late and he was pouring her whiskey. She didn\u2019t care anymore. </p><p>He was lean, and tall. He sometimes didn\u2019t wear an undershirt, so there were peeks of skin between the buttons when he stood or sat a certain way. It had been driving her mad for months. When she was touching herself she was bold in her thoughts and she fantasized of straddling him, slowly taking off his wire rims and sliding a finger slowly in and out of the gaps, caressing the furry flesh of his chest with her knuckles until his eyes gave her permission. She would slide off his lap to the floor and bite the buttons off, not rip. She wanted to feel the slight pain of it in her teeth, have the perverse pleasure of spitting each one out. She would lick the sweat that beaded on his taut belly, rip his zipper open- </p><p>The glasses tinkled in his hand.</p><p>It made her blush to think that she didn\u2019t want to care about his pleasure. She wanted to use only her mouth on him, take deep breaths of the secret scent trapped in his pubic hair, feel herself throb and trickle down her thighs. She would take his cock in her mouth, deep enough to make her throat contract, her hands claws at his narrow hips. She moaned at the deep red half moons her nails would leave. She would suck him so deep when he finally came and he withdrew there would be no semen dripping on her chin, just her hungry spittle.</p><p>She would finish herself off then, her clit a solid, pulsing thing, not just a button but the whole of her hips, with the taste and scent of his musk deep in her head-</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he said. She sighed shakily. He handed her the glass and she drank it down in two gulps, trying to kill the fire in her belly. She was wet. She wondered whether she had soaked through her jeans. She shook the glass. He poured her another, amused.</p><p>\u201cI thought you rarely drank.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Now</i>. There was once a time where I could drink \u2013 excuse my expression \u2013 an Irish Catholic under the table. I stopped for very vain reasons.\u201d She drank again, and only then did she feel the faraway burn of the liquor. It was a pale facsimile to her own heat.</p><p>\u201cVain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It dries out my beautiful skin,\u201d She gave him a crooked grin. She hadn\u2019t eaten much, so it was working fast.</p><p>He shot his, and she looked again. He sat, spread legged and barefoot. He was full, heavy between his legs. She was pointlessly empty and aching between hers. She gasped she wanted to touch him so much. It unnerved her.</p><p>She licked an amber drop from the rim of the glass. \u00a0\u201cI know why she chose you.\u201d She stood up, walked to his desk again, looked through his box and lifted out a photo with his old school newspaper staff. \u00a0He was in the middle with his arms slung around another young man. Tall, almost wispy, but everyone\u2019s eyes were on him. He was luminous, his smile a wonder. </p><p>He walked behind her. She put the photo back into the box. \u201cShe\u2019s got a brilliant eye.\u201d</p><p>She poured herself another drink. He looked bashful, almost.</p><p>\u201cYou chose each other, but soon after you married, you realized she chose you for the wrong reason. You hoped it would be because you were promising, talented, but nope.\u201d</p><p>She was spinning out again. She was on hormones and liquor, and naturally self-destructive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. You try to hide it behind wire rims and cheap suits, but you are. So. Fucking. Beautiful. And it\u2019s not just physical, but your very being is maddening. You make grown women want to rock back in forth in the fetal position, holding themselves. That\u2019s why you overcompensate with the nice. Sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, bemused.</p><p>\u201cShe was a treasure to you, the whole package, but you \u2026 you are a prize.\u201d She pointed at him with the glass.</p><p>He reacted, became rigid. She giggled at the irony of it, even though she knew it hurt. It was reckless.</p><p>She drank slow. \u201c\u2026A shallow thing. Even with the gray and the lines you are. Better even, flavored with experience, and heartbreak.\u201d She exaggerated the \u2018k\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s why she wanted to get her teeth back into you. You\u2019re a whole new flavor now.\u201d</p><p>As ever, she drank too much, too fast. The prospect of killing her constant pain made it impossible to ever be responsible with drugs. She caressed the bottle, appreciated the fact he wasn\u2019t so foolish as to take it from her.</p><p>\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve always had a talent for cutting through to the truth,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPity I\u2019m a mediocre journalist, then.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face, sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about that,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you keep mentioning it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so \u2026 ingenuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m brilliant.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019m paid very well because I\u2019m fucking good at knowing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. You used the word fuck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is happening? Why are you like this? Again, if I said something to upset you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, god dammit.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes shimmered.\u201cI know why you\u2019re doing this, so stop.\u201d He took her in his arms. \u201cI know.\u201d He took a deep breath in her hair. She smelled of whiskey and sweat. She untangled herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know? Your life was perfect. Good family. Good schools. Beautiful wife.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas. Apt choice of words. And yes, I know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d She felt out of control again. \u201cI should go home.\u201d He didn\u2019t physically try to stop her. She didn\u2019t know whether to be relieved or hurt.</p><p>\u201cSomeone stole you, and you\u2019re just trying to protect what\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>Her face twisted with emotion. \u201c'Protect what\u2019s left\u2019? Who told you that?\u201d Tears leaked out of the corners of her eyes. He took a step toward her, hand out to touch. </p><p>\u201cYou can dish it out, but you can\u2019t take it?\u201d His jaw muscles tightened underneath his beard. She hated herself.</p><p>\u201cNo one did. No, you did. In your work.\u201d He tried to hug her, but she pushed him away. He stood for several seconds, arms extended, his eyes tender.</p><p>\u201cYou want to save me? Make the boo boo all better?\u201d She was on her last wind. If it didn\u2019t put him off, she wouldn\u2019t have strength to run again. Her heart roared in her ears. Her chest hurt with tears she had not cried because no one would care about them, or about her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. It was quiet. He sat down. She gasped, sucked up an errant sob.\u201cI can\u2019t pretend to know about the depth and breadth of your pain, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to save you, you\u2019re a grown woman. I just \u2026 want you. All the time. Every day. Every hour. The scent and savor, your breath, your words. I want to feel the pain with you. I want to love it out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d She can\u2019t believe what she had heard, but her mouth spoke before thought.</p><p>\u201cAnd? Worthwhile things never are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA silly platitude.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBased on a very serious truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2026 worth all that.\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed. It made her jump.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what\u2019s so fucking funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just show you?\u201d He pointed to the journal. \u201cI know you\u2019re hurting, but are you being willfully obtuse?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI moved across the country to get a glimpse of you! My wife wasn\u2019t happy about it. She loves L.A. East Coast sensibilities never suited her. That\u2019s a quote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mediocre, and dense. Why don\u2019t you go three for three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck it. You\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but it was brassy. Fake. His eyes were alight with anger, and even then, he was lovely. She would lose him and spend her life wondering what he saw in her. It was a peacock chasing a nightingale.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d He was breathless. She hadn\u2019t realized she had spoken out loud. He walked into his bedroom and threw something on the desk. It was a well worn proof, a slim book with no cover. The pages were curling on the edges with love. She picked it up and looked at it. She knew what it was before opening it.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this? It didn\u2019t make it to print.\u201d </p><p>He plucked it from her hands and looked through it with a familiarity that made her feel instantly guilty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my people.\u201d He cleared his throat and read from a dog-eared page:</p><p><i>She didn\u2019t dare tell anyone how much love confounded her. She hated the feeling of floating. Being out of control, blinded by her desire, irritated her to no end. She had been alone for a long time, by choice. Her sight had been crystal clear to observe others floating, while she was mercifully weighted down to earth by her pain.</i></p><p>She leaned on the desk, silent.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you refuse to publish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know everything about me. Give it a guess.\u201d She couldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to guess. It's\u2026 when I found out and spoke to Harriman, he was completely perplexed. Said you sent the check back in full and told him to get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I would sue if he published.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou signed a contract. Technically, they had a right to publish. He told me you fired your agent and showed up at his door, begged until he agreed to tear it up. He felt sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were scared. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be long-winded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He guided her to the sofa, sat her down.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger and still lived at home, I used to nick all the books my sisters got from school and read them - if I hadn\u2019t already. They invariably came to me for help with essays and things, so it was just a smart thing to do, it saved time. One of them came home with The Bell Jar. Before then, I\u2019d only had very limited experience with Sylvia Plath. I don\u2019t have much patience for poetry, since it picks at my scabs, so to speak. Anyway, I read it and it frightened me. It\u2019s the only book that I couldn\u2019t finish reading. I couldn\u2019t help her with her essay. She got a dismal grade and hated me for a bit.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his, rubbed his lips against her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cShe wore her pain so openly. It\u2019s obscene. I don\u2019t want that, but I don\u2019t know how else to express myself. Why should I let it go public? Spreading it around doesn\u2019t necessarily lessen it. I don\u2019t want strangers pining indulgently with my pain. It\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a wonder,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDaniel\u2026\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple again, sweetly. It was a theme with him. She wanted to let go, turn her head, but muscle memory won.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am. I\u2019m no treasure. When I want to caress, I maul. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know who you are then. And I\u2019m willing to bleed a little to find out.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSilly man. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking. I live on that shed blood. And you\u2019re a thin one. Might not last too long.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to be funny, but it came off grim.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever worked so hard to get a woman to kiss me.\u201d He rubbed his lips against her cheekbone, his arms going around her waist.</p><p>\u201cAfter all that, you still want me?\u201d She felt emotionally overstretched. She wondered what time it was. Even the crickets were silent.</p><p>\u201cI am singularly concerned with what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t conceive of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I couldn\u2019t read that look earlier?\u201d</p><p>She was amused.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of what I do. Read between the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhuh. And?\u201d Her voice was shaky, despite herself.</p><p>\u201cYou said I was beautiful. No woman\u2019s called me that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. Impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not one. I\u2019ve been called hot. Sexy, or handsome. Never beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It makes the sentiment ours alone. You think I\u2019m beautiful. It\u2019s glorious.\u201d He giggled. He was so close his lashes tickled her. The roof of her mouth tingled like it did whenever she craved kisses. He kissed her cheek, then her jaw, and moved down. He squeezed her knee, then slowly pulled her legs open. She looked down, then closed her legs quickly.</p><p>She had soaked through her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhy so shy?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m tired, Daniel. It\u2019s been a weird night. I should go home.\u201d She was coming down off her whiskey high. She had exposed too much of herself.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d He slid off the sofa. He was on his knees in front of her. He spread her thighs again and looked at the wet spot. His eyes moved from between her legs to her flat belly, then up to her breasts. Her nipples hardened again. </p><p>\u201cTell me, then. What was I thinking?\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled at her, a slow smile that narrowed his eyes and relaxed his shoulders. It took her breath away. He leaned in for a kiss. She closed her eyes and parted her lips, conquered. She felt his mouth on her cunt instead. He breathed her in deeply, eyes closed, as his fingers found her fly. He pulled her jeans down with her panties. There were welts on her hips he was so forceful. She was sodden, an obscene pink that betrayed her. He pulled at her buttons, lost patience, then pulled the shirt over her head. He pulled her bra over her head, too impatient to unhook. She was naked except for her socks. He pulled them off, then bit the concave of her arches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said. He placed her legs over his shoulders, rubbed his prickly cheeks on her inner thighs. He couldn\u2019t kiss for licking. \u201cI\u2019m completely naked, and you\u2019re fully dressed.\u201d She ran her fingers through his thick hair. He sighed into her. It was delicious. He stopped and pulled his tie around so it hung down his back and placed it in her hand.</p><p>\u201cTry and stop me if you like.\u201d He spread her inner lips open with his tongue, licked from her opening to the base of her clit\u2026then bit. Not hard, but to push back the hood and steady her swollen bud to lick hungry circles into it.</p><p>She cursed and pulled, but he fought her. He squeezed both breasts, tugged at her nipples to the point of pain. She was suddenly scared. She had no anonymity with him like she had with the men she carefully picked online. She could play a part with them. \u00a0But not with Dan. If he made her come, she wouldn\u2019t be able to bounce away unscathed. Like a stray kitten, if he fed her, she\u2019d be back for his milk every day. She knew it.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Stop.\u201d She pulled on his tie. He buried the bottom of his face in her even deeper, though he was getting red from lack of breath. His fingers trailed red down her ribcage to her hips.</p><p>He began to suck on her. It was a hard, quick rhythm that made her pant, and she lost the strength to tug. He groaned into her, pushing her legs together against his face. He wanted to be surrounded by her, hidden away. He had fallen completely in love with her brittle strength, and was drugged by her fragility. He would break her and then help her put herself back together. He hoped she would let him. </p><p>Break her. The thought made him moan, long and rough, into her cunt. He wanted her all to himself. He was more hurt that he let on by her hesitation. </p><p>He stopped and unbuckled his belt, pulled down his underwear. Her eyes were wide and shiny, her mouth swollen although it was \u00a0unkissed. He resisted the urge and squeezed himself, gasping at the ache at the slightest touch of his fingers. Her lips formed into a moist O as he slid into her. It wasn\u2019t slow, or gentle. He pressed her thighs apart and fucked her hard and deep. He rocked her frame with each thrust, but she didn\u2019t moan or gasp. Her eyes rolled closed and she turned her face away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare. Look at me.\u201d He wrapped his hands around her waist, wondering at the tautness of her muscles. She opened her eyes. Her tongue was a glossy rose that made his balls tighten. But she didn\u2019t turn her head.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d She spread her legs wider and sighed. It was odd she didn\u2019t touch him. Cruel.</p><p>He took her hand, laced his fingers through hers and placed it above her head. She finally met his gaze. As soon as she did, she let out moan and curled into herself. She squeezed painfully around him but he fucked through it, ecstatic with her sudden warmth. He leaned into her and she caressed his face. She slid two fingers in his panting mouth, rubbed the pads of her fingers against his tongue, still so fragrant with her juices. He closed his eyes briefly and sucked, then nipped at them.</p><p>She pulled him down and kissed him hungrily, biting his lips. She couldn\u2019t help it \u2013 she had wanted to do it since they first met. He gasped with the pain of it, but he didn\u2019t stop. \u00a0She tasted iron and it maddened her. She sucked on his bruised lip and their hips ground against each other, his cock seeming to get harder. She could blossom with him.</p><p>He would not be frightened by the sharp corners of her.</p><p>She looked into his eyes, and for the first time dared to really let him look in hers. She smiled, finally feeling herself entirely in the fuck. Her hands moved to his hips, then his ass. She cupped, then clawed, unconsciously. </p><p>\u201cCome to bed with me,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cDo we need to move?\u201d she said. Her thighs squeezed tight around his hips.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make love here,\u201d he said, stilling.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve fooled me,\u201d she said, grabbing a handful of his hair. But his eyes shimmered again.</p><p>\u201cI want you in my bed. I want to smell you in my sheets in morning, after you\u2019re gone.\u201d </p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond to it. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I did that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe can kiss,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>She wiped his cuntwet chin. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You want more.\u201d She squeezed her muscles around him, and he shivered.</p><p>\u201cI want everything. But if kissing\u2019s all I can get, I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He said that, while fully inside her. But she knew what he meant. He wanted intimacy more than sex. He wanted <i>her</i>.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really do that,\u201d she said. She squirmed underneath him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t really do this,\u201d he said, and withdrew.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d she said softly, reaching out to him. He held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cCome. Let me show you,\u201d he said, and rose. \u201cIt\u2019s way more comfortable than this shitty sofa.\u201d She laid there and stared at him. He sighed. \u201cYou screamed and yelled for my affection less than three hours ago. Have you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>She draped her shirt over herself. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think it would mean anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had much luck in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means the world to me,\u201d he said, his hand still extended. \u201cBut what do the words matter if you don\u2019t trust me?\u201d He chuckled. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said as she rose. Her hip joints creaked with his previous passion.</p><p>\u201cYou said love,\u201d he said. </p><p>She gave him a long look, but he was pleased to see that she didn\u2019t start dressing. </p><p>\u201cI mean, in general,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. She put her hand in his, and he guided her to his room. It was spare, but his bed was large and cozy.</p><p>\u201cSorry it\u2019s so empty,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no good at interior design,\u201d he said, and pulled back his comforter. She noticed a pile of books on the nightstand, and a box filled with picture frames in the corner by the door. She saw another glossy photo, this time of a tropical locale. He kicked the box into the closet and slammed it shut. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to get rid of those. They\u2019re dated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said, eyeing the bed. It looked so inviting. He sat down and patted the place beside him.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said. The sodium lights filtered through his blinds and lit his skin golden. She pressed herself against him. </p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust sit?\u201d she said, smiling into his hair.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you like. We can talk. Or kiss. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you want from me?\u201d she said again. She put his hands on her breasts. He squeezed, then kissed between them, near her heart. Her head spun. He yawned, laid back, and put his legs underneath the comforter. Again, he patted the place beside him.</p><p>\u201cCome on. It\u2019s real down. Really nice,\u201d he said. She sat and rubbed the cool sheets.</p><p>\u201cSo, talking?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI want to know everything about you,\u201d he said. He tucked his hands behind his head. The comforter only covered from his knees down. He was still slick from belly to thighs. It was strange, smelling herself mingled with him. But not at all unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cThere really isn\u2019t much to know. Pain doesn\u2019t mean complexity,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then it won\u2019t take so long,\u201d he said, and winked.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou are a master of elegant oversimplification,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d he said, and caressed up her arm. \u201cBut I\u2019m also good at other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she said, giving his a crooked grin.</p><p>\u201cI meant long talks. And cuddling,\u201d he said. </p><p>She lay over the comforter. \u201cCuddling?\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t done that in a while. I might be rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. She touched his chest. His chest hair was damp and silky.\u201cCome.\u201d He pulled her closer, and she lay her head over his heart. </p>",

She didn&rsquo;t mean to yell.

She cursed loud enough to make his neighbors stare as she ran back to her car.</p><p>The echo of what she said filled her with an exhilarating dread. He knew now. She laid everything bare. In her passion she hadn&rsquo;t only spoken her feelings for him, but made no secret of the way she felt about the way he lived his life. </p><p>Drama made her ill. She shivered, although sweat beaded her brow. She licked her lip and tasted salt. She couldn&rsquo;t drive like this. She grabbed her bag on the passenger seat, and for some reason, the act finally broke her.</p><p>Her breathless, strangled groans strengthened quickly to howls. She squeezed her bag in her hands, wrung the empty flaccid thing. Her tears were plentiful and fast, and soon the leather was streaked with saltwater. She looked back at the empty passenger seat and her body stiffened. She couldn&rsquo;t do it a second longer. Wait. Endure.</p><p>She opened the door to run.</p><p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; She nearly knocked him over.</p><p>She wiped her eyes violently. &ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; She slammed the door and started down the entrance of his courtyard. The sodium lights made his brown hair flash auburn. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop.&rdquo; She kept walking. Her cheeks stung. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go anywhere in that condition. Come inside. I&rsquo;ll make you a cup of tea.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She stopped walking, but didn&rsquo;t turn around.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said. She heard the gravel under his heels, the slight hitch a back injury has caused.</p><p>She looked down at her waterlogged bag, then at the road. She followed him back to his cottage. He closed the door behind her, his delicate hands overly precious on the deadlock. She had wanted, and wondered at his hands. </p><p>Now he knew.</p><p>He walked to the kitchen, ducking his head on the glass fixture that hung too low. It swung softly as he made her favorite. He had made it many times - it was a thoughtless exercise. She ached, but still drank in his silence. The vertical lines between his eyes were deep. His hands were steady, pouring and stirring. The thought of his pity, of a kindness rendered to a friend in pain, made her mouth fill with saliva. She hiccuped.</p><p>He set the cup down in front of her. &ldquo;Drink.&rdquo; He adjusted his worn tie. His jaw clenched, but his eyes were soft. She took the cup in her hand, warm ceramic, rounded and comfortable. There was chip on the lip. She rubbed her bottom lip against it.</p><p>&ldquo;My neighbor. He said you were crying in your car.&rdquo; </p><p>She swallowed too deeply, and hissed as it burned down her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Really loudly.&rdquo; His eyes made her hand tremble. She put the cup down. Rolled her sore eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to cause a disturbance.&rdquo; She meant it. Now that she was empty of passion, her outburst seemed ridiculous. She stood up. &ldquo;Thank you. I&hellip;um&hellip;think I&rsquo;m okay to drive now.&rdquo; She took quick strides to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for everything I said it was ridiculous display <i>I&rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress lately please forget I ever did it-</i>&rdquo; Her words tumbled together. She hit the door running, nearly tore the knob off.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to forget.&rdquo; It was barely louder than breath.</p><p>She stopped cold, turned her head to look at him. He stood by his table, lips parted, with expectant eyes. She was punch drunk.</p><p>&ldquo;Come inside.&rdquo; He pointed to his sofa. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>She was dangerously close to tears again. She wanted to run into his arms, hug him, begin memorizing his limbs. Instead, she sat by him. He was silent for a full minute, looking down at his tented fingers. She looked at his hands too, empty, sifting the light. She waited. She could exist there forever, in that silence. It crackled. </p><p>&ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; He woke her from her day dream.</p><p>&ldquo;The first time I saw you. You were none too kind,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;We met at an awkward time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you thought I was here to micromanage you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did. You did, for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trouble. Why?&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;You. It was what I thought the first time I saw you.&rdquo; He smiled down at his hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, though. We did meet at an awkward time.&rdquo;</p><p>She had pieced together the two sentence story in the course of their year working together. </p><p>His wife cheated, then left. He was heartbroken. The end. Her story had more to it, but she had slowly discovered that it was no more heavy.</p><p>&ldquo;Again, I&rsquo;m sorry for the outburst-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; </p><p>Her corners of her mouth turned up.</p><p>&ldquo;She told me I drove her mad with my silences. She got frustrated and screamed like you. Banged around. Said she had to make up for it.&rdquo;</p><p>Her smile faded, but she waited.</p><p>&ldquo;At first we laughed it of, made love and that would be the end of it. But eventually, she stopped trying. To fill the silences.&rdquo;</p><p>His hands were now fists at his knees. The light shone through his beard. The hair was golden, auburn, brown, and not thick enough to hide his jumping pulse. She wanted to touch him, but didn&rsquo;t. It was petulant.</p><p>&ldquo;Then, she was quieter than I was. Even when I found out, she was quiet. No excuse. No apology. Just a shrug, then silence. If I&rsquo;d known it was so horrifying, &nbsp;I would&rsquo;ve tried-&rdquo;</p><p>He trembled beside her, then he was weeping. It was so sudden and intense she stared for a bit. His face was a grimace, his bottom lip trembling. His sobs were desperate, sloppy. His pain was completely on the surface. She touched him, finally, two fingers on his cheek. Questioning. The heat of his tears made her nipples harden. </p><p>He leaned into her and wrapped his arms around her waist. He buried his head in her breast and she was in it now. Her sternum vibrated with his pain. He squeezed hard, gasped into her neck. His beard scratched at her saltsore skin. She had been angry before. He had made her feel like an echo. But there was more to him than what she thought. Her own tears soon wet his hair. She didn&rsquo;t weep, though. She didn&rsquo;t dare take that from him. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know how long they sat that way. His grip on her did not loosen. The front of her blouse stuck to her breasts with tears, saliva and his condensed breath but she was still. Even if he just shared his pain with her, it was something, and she would cherish it.</p><p>His sobs quieted to an occasional hiccup, but he did not raise his head. She scratched the short hairs at the back of his neck, took in the scent of his hair. Her body must&rsquo;ve reacted because he finally looked at her. His brown eyes were luminous with feeling. After a year of inscrutability, it made her gasp.</p><p>He took her in his arms, kissed her temple.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite know how or why I did it. Just two months ago she stood in the same place you did. She loves me, she said. Misses me. I cried, hard, for her. Many nights, but not in a while. It&rsquo;s like she knew.&rdquo;</p><p>She stiffened again, but he rubbed her back. </p><p>&ldquo;She told me what I fantasized about &ndash; that she had made a huge mistake, that he wasn&rsquo;t what she thought he was. That maybe my silences weren&rsquo;t that bad after all-&rdquo; he wheezed. She supposed it was meant to be a snort. &ldquo;-and that she wanted me to come home.&rdquo;</p><p>His hand moved slowly up her spine to squeeze the back of her neck.</p><p>&ldquo;As I looked at her, I finally figured out how she was different. Physically, she hadn&rsquo;t changed. Not really. Same hair, same skin, same scent. But she was &hellip; uh, smaller. She no longer took up all the air in the room.&rdquo;</p><p>He was looking out the window into the dark. &ldquo;She knew, then. I didn&rsquo;t have to say a word. Despite all her complaints about my illegibility, she knew me well enough.&rdquo; His eyes were those of a man waking from a bad dream. He turned back to her.</p><p>&ldquo;You. You called me a goddamn asshole.&rdquo;</p><p>Her cheeks tingled. &ldquo;You &hellip; saw me spinning out and didn&rsquo;t react. Your face was illegible. Illegible, ha! I was pissed. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh&hellip;&rdquo; a smiled played on his lips. She raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I was stone-faced because I wanted to smile, but I knew if I did, you might kill me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Smile?&rdquo; She tucked his damp hair behind his ear. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>He let her go, reluctantly enough to make her sigh. She was quickly getting used to his touch. He rummaged in his desk, pulling at drawers that creaked.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, why do you have that old thing?&rdquo; She walked over and traced the scratched surface.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my lucky desk. Been with me all my life, I&rsquo;m never getting rid of it.&rdquo; </p><p>There was a box of various awards in the corner. &ldquo;Ooh. Shiny things.&rdquo; He walked into the dark alcove of his bedroom, muttering to himself.</p><p>She rummaged. His name, then &ldquo;Editor of the Year&rdquo; etched into&nbsp; a glass block. Parchment. Metal. She picked up a diploma. Cornell University. Master&rsquo;s in Journalism. She blew the dust off.&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you hung this up in your office? Lord knows it cost enough.&rdquo; There was no response.</p><p>There was a black and white photo at the bottom of the box, dustiest of all. A woman and a man kissing in bed. The Eiffel Tower twinkled in the distance, perfectly centered. It was a postcard.</p><p>She hesitated, then picked it up and wiped the dust off. He was young and beautiful, his long lean body naked above the waist. There were no lines at the corners of his closed eyes, no gray in the temples. There was a smile on the woman&rsquo;s mouth. Her brow was pale and smooth &ndash; she was worried about how the photo would come out, not about the kiss. She unconsciously traced the curve of his back, making a line on the dusty glass.</p><p>&ldquo;Found it!&rdquo; He snatched the photo frame away and replaced it with something. It was an old composition book &ndash; the kind with the black and white pattern on the cover. She giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;Good lord, I haven&rsquo;t seen one of these since middle school!&rdquo; She opened it and saw a trimmed printout stapled to the page. A news article. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p><p>She sat down on the sofa and began to riffle through the pages. There were printouts from papers in Los Angeles, Houston, Boston, New York. His spidery handwriting littered all the empty spaces, spilling onto the lined pages. She kept flipping. Phoenix, Miami. He sat and leaned into her. The weight and scent of him distracted her. She stared at him as he looked for something in the pages.</p><p>&ldquo;Here. Look.&rdquo; She wanted to kiss him, but didn&rsquo;t act on it. Perhaps her outburst had knocked something loose in him &ndash; nothing more. His eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; She brought the book closer to her face. It was an old article from when she was a Dear Abbie-type columnist for a local paper in Connecticut. She flipped the page. There was more, marked up like the others. There were underlined bits, and many exclamation marks.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t dare read the notations, for fear of ruining the moment. He was ruthless with a pen. That&rsquo;s why they called him Zorro.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you get these?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My wife &ndash; my ex-wife. She&rsquo;s from there, and most of her family still lives there. She has a subscription to feel a bit closer to them, know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded.&ldquo;Why all the articles?&rdquo;</p><p>He took the book from her. &ldquo;I was searching. I had grown bored in LA, and I wanted something new. These are the best and brightest I could find from around the States,&rdquo; he said, rifling through the pages. He stopped at Houston. &ldquo;She figured out the connection between Mexican vegetables and the Mob &ndash; nearly got herself killed. She&rsquo;s still under police protection.&rdquo;</p><p>He flipped to Miami. &ldquo;This kid wrote a police corruption article that got the commissioner fired. Just 23 years old he was,&rdquo; he smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;Good stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I wrote witty responses to housewives and teenagers.&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t cowed, but she was curious. How did she fit in then, or even now? She was a lowly staff writer. Frankly, before he was there to make her mad, she had been miserable. She had been about to quit and go back to school for literature when he came &ndash; had even put in the transfer request at her old university. One look, and school was forgotten.</p><p>He closed the book. &ldquo;One evening my wife was laughing, loud &ndash; a rare sound in our house by that time - and I was curious. She sent me the link. In ten minutes, I had the first printout stapled to the journal.&rdquo;</p><p>She still didn&rsquo;t understand the link. She shrugged.&nbsp;</p><p>He sighed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really, really good. Has anyone told you that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At what? Regurgitating press releases? By your savage editing, I would think not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nevermind that,&rdquo; he dismissed her comment. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very good writer. Brilliant, if you&rsquo;re not writing about the latest murder or terrorist act.&rdquo;</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him.&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m mediocre at my job?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p><p>Her eyes widened. He was usually very frank, but considering what had just happened, it was a bit much.</p><p>He noticed. &ldquo;No. Well, sort of. Let me explain. You have no peer that I know of in painting a picture in words, but it must be <i>your</i> picture. You&rsquo;re not the best copy machine, so to speak. Your boredom bleeds through and stains it.&rdquo; He spoke with his hands when he was excited, and he did then, wriggling his fingers in feigned disgust.</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t sure what was happening. She had cried. Then he had cried. And now she was &hellip; boring? She couldn&rsquo;t process where the evening was headed. Her eyes still felt gritty from crying. His tears and sweat were making her breasts itch.</p><p>&ldquo;Your wife&rsquo;s family is from Greenwich?&rdquo; It was all she could think to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. She read the paper daily. Eventually, so did I. At least, your bit. Until you announced you were moving on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; </p><p>He looked at her, expecting more. She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, and when I saw that, I was curious as to who you were and whether you were moving to another paper or moving on literally. Quitting. It put a fire under my ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My wife knows the editor in chief &ndash; &nbsp;they went to school together, you know, and she did me the favor of asking about you.&rdquo;</p><p>Her lips parted. He smiled at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Stalker.&rdquo; It was a whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;Admirer. Fan.&rdquo;</p><p>Now she was dizzy. &ldquo;But, how exactly? You were there, not two months after I started. As far as I know, the editor before you wasn&rsquo;t going to retire for several years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After the owner saw my dusty box of awards, she gave him an offer he couldn&rsquo;t refuse. And I was in.&rdquo; He picked at a ragged corner of the journal. &ldquo;It was during that time that my wife left me. During the move.&rdquo;</p><p>The first time they met he was dour-faced and rumpled. She figured it was stress. But he was freshly wounded.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He was timid with his revelation.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know me. Why? What if I had been &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, a pseudonym for a gay man? A 60 year old woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered. Doesn&rsquo;t take away from your brilliance. I was ready for anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you. I knew you were trouble from the moment you walked into my office with your printed scarf and your hair curling all around your face. You were so earnest.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because you were hurt. I could feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I was illegible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t blinded then. We were bickering in minutes.&rdquo; She chuckled. &ldquo;You are infuriating at times. Need a filter installed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Said the pot to the kettle.&rdquo; He was right. The atmosphere became suddenly heavy, and it took effort not to lean over and put her mouth on his. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the kettle right? You&rsquo;ve got the spout.&rdquo; She wiggled her pinkie finger. </p><p>He wrapped his fingers around it, stilling her. &rdquo;What are you trying to say?&rdquo; His breath was sweet and warm on her cheek. Honeyed. The juvenile silliness of the sentiment made her giggle. He thought she was a good writer.</p><p>&ldquo;Mediocre, yet brilliant,&rdquo; she said out loud.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your ex-wife. She&rsquo;s a famous photographer?&rdquo; </p><p>He was perplexed, but he responded. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She blinked slowly, waited. &ldquo;We met in college. I was editor of the paper. She wasn&rsquo;t famous yet, but promising.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s brave. That spread on Aleppo for Time was amazing.&rdquo; And it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Not brave enough,&rdquo; he said, and stood up abruptly. &ldquo;Want a drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. What d'you have?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bourbon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect. I&rsquo;ll have it neat.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised a brow and reached for the bottle on the shelf. She had never had the opportunity to observe him like she wanted to, but it was late and he was pouring her whiskey. She didn&rsquo;t care anymore. </p><p>He was lean, and tall. He sometimes didn&rsquo;t wear an undershirt, so there were peeks of skin between the buttons when he stood or sat a certain way. It had been driving her mad for months. When she was touching herself she was bold in her thoughts and she fantasized of straddling him, slowly taking off his wire rims and sliding a finger slowly in and out of the gaps, caressing the furry flesh of his chest with her knuckles until his eyes gave her permission. She would slide off his lap to the floor and bite the buttons off, not rip. She wanted to feel the slight pain of it in her teeth, have the perverse pleasure of spitting each one out. She would lick the sweat that beaded on his taut belly, rip his zipper open- </p><p>The glasses tinkled in his hand.</p><p>It made her blush to think that she didn&rsquo;t want to care about his pleasure. She wanted to use only her mouth on him, take deep breaths of the secret scent trapped in his pubic hair, feel herself throb and trickle down her thighs. She would take his cock in her mouth, deep enough to make her throat contract, her hands claws at his narrow hips. She moaned at the deep red half moons her nails would leave. She would suck him so deep when he finally came and he withdrew there would be no semen dripping on her chin, just her hungry spittle.</p><p>She would finish herself off then, her clit a solid, pulsing thing, not just a button but the whole of her hips, with the taste and scent of his musk deep in her head-</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he said. She sighed shakily. He handed her the glass and she drank it down in two gulps, trying to kill the fire in her belly. She was wet. She wondered whether she had soaked through her jeans. She shook the glass. He poured her another, amused.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you rarely drank.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i>. There was once a time where I could drink &ndash; excuse my expression &ndash; an Irish Catholic under the table. I stopped for very vain reasons.&rdquo; She drank again, and only then did she feel the faraway burn of the liquor. It was a pale facsimile to her own heat.</p><p>&ldquo;Vain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. It dries out my beautiful skin,&rdquo; She gave him a crooked grin. She hadn&rsquo;t eaten much, so it was working fast.</p><p>He shot his, and she looked again. He sat, spread legged and barefoot. He was full, heavy between his legs. She was pointlessly empty and aching between hers. She gasped she wanted to touch him so much. It unnerved her.</p><p>She licked an amber drop from the rim of the glass. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know why she chose you.&rdquo; She stood up, walked to his desk again, looked through his box and lifted out a photo with his old school newspaper staff. &nbsp;He was in the middle with his arms slung around another young man. Tall, almost wispy, but everyone&rsquo;s eyes were on him. He was luminous, his smile a wonder. </p><p>He walked behind her. She put the photo back into the box. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a brilliant eye.&rdquo;</p><p>She poured herself another drink. He looked bashful, almost.</p><p>&ldquo;You chose each other, but soon after you married, you realized she chose you for the wrong reason. You hoped it would be because you were promising, talented, but nope.&rdquo;</p><p>She was spinning out again. She was on hormones and liquor, and naturally self-destructive.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful. You try to hide it behind wire rims and cheap suits, but you are. So. Fucking. Beautiful. And it&rsquo;s not just physical, but your very being is maddening. You make grown women want to rock back in forth in the fetal position, holding themselves. That&rsquo;s why you overcompensate with the nice. Sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at her, bemused.</p><p>&ldquo;She was a treasure to you, the whole package, but you &hellip; you are a prize.&rdquo; She pointed at him with the glass.</p><p>He reacted, became rigid. She giggled at the irony of it, even though she knew it hurt. It was reckless.</p><p>She drank slow. &ldquo;&hellip;A shallow thing. Even with the gray and the lines you are. Better even, flavored with experience, and heartbreak.&rdquo; She exaggerated the &lsquo;k&rsquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s why she wanted to get her teeth back into you. You&rsquo;re a whole new flavor now.&rdquo;</p><p>As ever, she drank too much, too fast. The prospect of killing her constant pain made it impossible to ever be responsible with drugs. She caressed the bottle, appreciated the fact he wasn&rsquo;t so foolish as to take it from her.</p><p>&ldquo;It seems you&rsquo;ve always had a talent for cutting through to the truth,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Pity I&rsquo;m a mediocre journalist, then.&rdquo;</p><p>He rubbed his face, sighed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit about that,&rdquo; she said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why do you keep mentioning it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s so &hellip; ingenuous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m brilliant.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a question. She looked up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;m paid very well because I&rsquo;m fucking good at knowing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh. You used the word fuck.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What is happening? Why are you like this? Again, if I said something to upset you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, god dammit.&rdquo;</p><p>His brown eyes shimmered.&ldquo;I know why you&rsquo;re doing this, so stop.&rdquo; He took her in his arms. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in her hair. She smelled of whiskey and sweat. She untangled herself.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you know? Your life was perfect. Good family. Good schools. Beautiful wife.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Was. Apt choice of words. And yes, I know about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She felt out of control again. &ldquo;I should go home.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t physically try to stop her. She didn&rsquo;t know whether to be relieved or hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone stole you, and you&rsquo;re just trying to protect what&rsquo;s left.&rdquo;</p><p>Her face twisted with emotion. &ldquo;'Protect what&rsquo;s left&rsquo;? Who told you that?&rdquo; Tears leaked out of the corners of her eyes. He took a step toward her, hand out to touch. </p><p>&ldquo;You can dish it out, but you can&rsquo;t take it?&rdquo; His jaw muscles tightened underneath his beard. She hated herself.</p><p>&ldquo;No one did. No, you did. In your work.&rdquo; He tried to hug her, but she pushed him away. He stood for several seconds, arms extended, his eyes tender.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to save me? Make the boo boo all better?&rdquo; She was on her last wind. If it didn&rsquo;t put him off, she wouldn&rsquo;t have strength to run again. Her heart roared in her ears. Her chest hurt with tears she had not cried because no one would care about them, or about her.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. It was quiet. He sat down. She gasped, sucked up an errant sob.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pretend to know about the depth and breadth of your pain, but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to save you, you&rsquo;re a grown woman. I just &hellip; want you. All the time. Every day. Every hour. The scent and savor, your breath, your words. I want to feel the pain with you. I want to love it out of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that simple.&rdquo; She can&rsquo;t believe what she had heard, but her mouth spoke before thought.</p><p>&ldquo;And? Worthwhile things never are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A silly platitude.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Based on a very serious truth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not &hellip; worth all that.&rdquo;</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed. It made her jump.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, what&rsquo;s so fucking funny?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did I just show you?&rdquo; He pointed to the journal. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re hurting, but are you being willfully obtuse?&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;I moved across the country to get a glimpse of you! My wife wasn&rsquo;t happy about it. She loves L.A. East Coast sensibilities never suited her. That&rsquo;s a quote.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mediocre, and dense. Why don&rsquo;t you go three for three?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck it. You&rsquo;re being a bitch.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, but it was brassy. Fake. His eyes were alight with anger, and even then, he was lovely. She would lose him and spend her life wondering what he saw in her. It was a peacock chasing a nightingale.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; He was breathless. She hadn&rsquo;t realized she had spoken out loud. He walked into his bedroom and threw something on the desk. It was a well worn proof, a slim book with no cover. The pages were curling on the edges with love. She picked it up and looked at it. She knew what it was before opening it.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you get this? It didn&rsquo;t make it to print.&rdquo; </p><p>He plucked it from her hands and looked through it with a familiarity that made her feel instantly guilty.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my people.&rdquo; He cleared his throat and read from a dog-eared page:</p><p><i>She didn&rsquo;t dare tell anyone how much love confounded her. She hated the feeling of floating. Being out of control, blinded by her desire, irritated her to no end. She had been alone for a long time, by choice. Her sight had been crystal clear to observe others floating, while she was mercifully weighted down to earth by her pain.</i></p><p>She leaned on the desk, silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you refuse to publish?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You seem to know everything about me. Give it a guess.&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even begin to guess. It's&hellip; when I found out and spoke to Harriman, he was completely perplexed. Said you sent the check back in full and told him to get rid of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told him I would sue if he published.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You signed a contract. Technically, they had a right to publish. He told me you fired your agent and showed up at his door, begged until he agreed to tear it up. He felt sorry for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was drunk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were scared. Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I be long-winded?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo; He guided her to the sofa, sat her down.</p><p>&ldquo;When I was younger and still lived at home, I used to nick all the books my sisters got from school and read them - if I hadn&rsquo;t already. They invariably came to me for help with essays and things, so it was just a smart thing to do, it saved time. One of them came home with The Bell Jar. Before then, I&rsquo;d only had very limited experience with Sylvia Plath. I don&rsquo;t have much patience for poetry, since it picks at my scabs, so to speak. Anyway, I read it and it frightened me. It&rsquo;s the only book that I couldn&rsquo;t finish reading. I couldn&rsquo;t help her with her essay. She got a dismal grade and hated me for a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>He took her hand in his, rubbed his lips against her knuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;She wore her pain so openly. It&rsquo;s obscene. I don&rsquo;t want that, but I don&rsquo;t know how else to express myself. Why should I let it go public? Spreading it around doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lessen it. I don&rsquo;t want strangers pining indulgently with my pain. It&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a wonder,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Daniel&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He kissed her temple again, sweetly. It was a theme with him. She wanted to let go, turn her head, but muscle memory won.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not who you think I am. I&rsquo;m no treasure. When I want to caress, I maul. I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to know who you are then. And I&rsquo;m willing to bleed a little to find out.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed. &ldquo;Silly man. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking. I live on that shed blood. And you&rsquo;re a thin one. Might not last too long.&rdquo;</p><p>She was trying to be funny, but it came off grim.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever worked so hard to get a woman to kiss me.&rdquo; He rubbed his lips against her cheekbone, his arms going around her waist.</p><p>&ldquo;After all that, you still want me?&rdquo; She felt emotionally overstretched. She wondered what time it was. Even the crickets were silent.</p><p>&ldquo;I am singularly concerned with what you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t conceive of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think I couldn&rsquo;t read that look earlier?&rdquo;</p><p>She was amused.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of what I do. Read between the lines.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhuh. And?&rdquo; Her voice was shaky, despite herself.</p><p>&ldquo;You said I was beautiful. No woman&rsquo;s called me that before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liar. Impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Not one. I&rsquo;ve been called hot. Sexy, or handsome. Never beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it bother you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. It makes the sentiment ours alone. You think I&rsquo;m beautiful. It&rsquo;s glorious.&rdquo; He giggled. He was so close his lashes tickled her. The roof of her mouth tingled like it did whenever she craved kisses. He kissed her cheek, then her jaw, and moved down. He squeezed her knee, then slowly pulled her legs open. She looked down, then closed her legs quickly.</p><p>She had soaked through her jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;Why so shy?&rdquo;</p><p>She waved her hand dismissively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, Daniel. It&rsquo;s been a weird night. I should go home.&rdquo; She was coming down off her whiskey high. She had exposed too much of herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Please stay.&rdquo; He slid off the sofa. He was on his knees in front of her. He spread her thighs again and looked at the wet spot. His eyes moved from between her legs to her flat belly, then up to her breasts. Her nipples hardened again. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, then. What was I thinking?&rdquo; she said.</p><p>He smiled at her, a slow smile that narrowed his eyes and relaxed his shoulders. It took her breath away. He leaned in for a kiss. She closed her eyes and parted her lips, conquered. She felt his mouth on her cunt instead. He breathed her in deeply, eyes closed, as his fingers found her fly. He pulled her jeans down with her panties. There were welts on her hips he was so forceful. She was sodden, an obscene pink that betrayed her. He pulled at her buttons, lost patience, then pulled the shirt over her head. He pulled her bra over her head, too impatient to unhook. She was naked except for her socks. He pulled them off, then bit the concave of her arches.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; she said. He placed her legs over his shoulders, rubbed his prickly cheeks on her inner thighs. He couldn&rsquo;t kiss for licking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m completely naked, and you&rsquo;re fully dressed.&rdquo; She ran her fingers through his thick hair. He sighed into her. It was delicious. He stopped and pulled his tie around so it hung down his back and placed it in her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Try and stop me if you like.&rdquo; He spread her inner lips open with his tongue, licked from her opening to the base of her clit&hellip;then bit. Not hard, but to push back the hood and steady her swollen bud to lick hungry circles into it.</p><p>She cursed and pulled, but he fought her. He squeezed both breasts, tugged at her nipples to the point of pain. She was suddenly scared. She had no anonymity with him like she had with the men she carefully picked online. She could play a part with them. &nbsp;But not with Dan. If he made her come, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to bounce away unscathed. Like a stray kitten, if he fed her, she&rsquo;d be back for his milk every day. She knew it.</p><p>&ldquo;Please. Stop.&rdquo; She pulled on his tie. He buried the bottom of his face in her even deeper, though he was getting red from lack of breath. His fingers trailed red down her ribcage to her hips.</p><p>He began to suck on her. It was a hard, quick rhythm that made her pant, and she lost the strength to tug. He groaned into her, pushing her legs together against his face. He wanted to be surrounded by her, hidden away. He had fallen completely in love with her brittle strength, and was drugged by her fragility. He would break her and then help her put herself back together. He hoped she would let him. </p><p>Break her. The thought made him moan, long and rough, into her cunt. He wanted her all to himself. He was more hurt that he let on by her hesitation. </p><p>He stopped and unbuckled his belt, pulled down his underwear. Her eyes were wide and shiny, her mouth swollen although it was &nbsp;unkissed. He resisted the urge and squeezed himself, gasping at the ache at the slightest touch of his fingers. Her lips formed into a moist O as he slid into her. It wasn&rsquo;t slow, or gentle. He pressed her thighs apart and fucked her hard and deep. He rocked her frame with each thrust, but she didn&rsquo;t moan or gasp. Her eyes rolled closed and she turned her face away.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare. Look at me.&rdquo; He wrapped his hands around her waist, wondering at the tautness of her muscles. She opened her eyes. Her tongue was a glossy rose that made his balls tighten. But she didn&rsquo;t turn her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo; She spread her legs wider and sighed. It was odd she didn&rsquo;t touch him. Cruel.</p><p>He took her hand, laced his fingers through hers and placed it above her head. She finally met his gaze. As soon as she did, she let out moan and curled into herself. She squeezed painfully around him but he fucked through it, ecstatic with her sudden warmth. He leaned into her and she caressed his face. She slid two fingers in his panting mouth, rubbed the pads of her fingers against his tongue, still so fragrant with her juices. He closed his eyes briefly and sucked, then nipped at them.</p><p>She pulled him down and kissed him hungrily, biting his lips. She couldn&rsquo;t help it &ndash; she had wanted to do it since they first met. He gasped with the pain of it, but he didn&rsquo;t stop. &nbsp;She tasted iron and it maddened her. She sucked on his bruised lip and their hips ground against each other, his cock seeming to get harder. She could blossom with him.</p><p>He would not be frightened by the sharp corners of her.</p><p>She looked into his eyes, and for the first time dared to really let him look in hers. She smiled, finally feeling herself entirely in the fuck. Her hands moved to his hips, then his ass. She cupped, then clawed, unconsciously. </p><p>&ldquo;Come to bed with me,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>&ldquo;Do we need to move?&rdquo; she said. Her thighs squeezed tight around his hips.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make love here,&rdquo; he said, stilling.</p><p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve fooled me,&rdquo; she said, grabbing a handful of his hair. But his eyes shimmered again.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you in my bed. I want to smell you in my sheets in morning, after you&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo; </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know how to respond to it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while since I did that,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;We can kiss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you want.&rdquo;</p><p>She wiped his cuntwet chin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. You want more.&rdquo; She squeezed her muscles around him, and he shivered.</p><p>&ldquo;I want everything. But if kissing&rsquo;s all I can get, I&rsquo;m okay with that.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. He said that, while fully inside her. But she knew what he meant. He wanted intimacy more than sex. He wanted <i>her</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really do that,&rdquo; she said. She squirmed underneath him.</p><p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t really do this,&rdquo; he said, and withdrew.</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; she said softly, reaching out to him. He held out his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Come. Let me show you,&rdquo; he said, and rose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s way more comfortable than this shitty sofa.&rdquo; She laid there and stared at him. He sighed. &ldquo;You screamed and yelled for my affection less than three hours ago. Have you changed your mind?&rdquo;</p><p>She draped her shirt over herself. &ldquo;I honestly didn&rsquo;t think it would mean anything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had much luck in love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means the world to me,&rdquo; he said, his hand still extended. &ldquo;But what do the words matter if you don&rsquo;t trust me?&rdquo; He chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said as she rose. Her hip joints creaked with his previous passion.</p><p>&ldquo;You said love,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>She gave him a long look, but he was pleased to see that she didn&rsquo;t start dressing. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, in general,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said. She put her hand in his, and he guided her to his room. It was spare, but his bed was large and cozy.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry it&rsquo;s so empty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good at interior design,&rdquo; he said, and pulled back his comforter. She noticed a pile of books on the nightstand, and a box filled with picture frames in the corner by the door. She saw another glossy photo, this time of a tropical locale. He kicked the box into the closet and slammed it shut. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get rid of those. They&rsquo;re dated.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, eyeing the bed. It looked so inviting. He sat down and patted the place beside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he said. The sodium lights filtered through his blinds and lit his skin golden. She pressed herself against him. </p><p>&ldquo;Sit,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Just sit?&rdquo; she said, smiling into his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;As long as you like. We can talk. Or kiss. Anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all you want from me?&rdquo; she said again. She put his hands on her breasts. He squeezed, then kissed between them, near her heart. Her head spun. He yawned, laid back, and put his legs underneath the comforter. Again, he patted the place beside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on. It&rsquo;s real down. Really nice,&rdquo; he said. She sat and rubbed the cool sheets.</p><p>&ldquo;So, talking?&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to know everything about you,&rdquo; he said. He tucked his hands behind his head. The comforter only covered from his knees down. He was still slick from belly to thighs. It was strange, smelling herself mingled with him. But not at all unpleasant.</p><p>&ldquo;There really isn&rsquo;t much to know. Pain doesn&rsquo;t mean complexity,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Then it won&rsquo;t take so long,&rdquo; he said, and winked.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. &ldquo;You are a master of elegant oversimplification,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my job,&rdquo; he said, and caressed up her arm. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m also good at other things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; she said, giving his a crooked grin.</p><p>&ldquo;I meant long talks. And cuddling,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>She lay over the comforter. &ldquo;Cuddling?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done that in a while. I might be rusty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he said. She touched his chest. His chest hair was damp and silky.&ldquo;Come.&rdquo; He pulled her closer, and she lay her head over his heart. </p>",

In my 20&prime;s, I was one of those bitches who barely watched television, didn&rsquo;t read comic books or stan actors/actresses, and only watched sometimes irritating, ridiculous indie films for the &ldquo;brilliant photography&rdquo;. Artsy Hipster trash.<br /></p>\n<p>I wrote for another popular blog - OC erotica - but I was miserable and uninspired. I was beyond writing just hanky-panky. I wanted to write <b>more</b> than porn, but at the time, I felt it was all I was good at. I didn&rsquo;t feel I had the focus and the creativity to breathe life into a character and give them a compelling story. I subscribed to Netflix out of boredom. I adored Olivia Colman. I avoided Broadchurch for months because I don&rsquo;t like police procedurals (ha! joke&rsquo;s on me) but I couldn&rsquo;t resist more Olivia. Enter Hardy.<i> I was bested.</i> I wrote this, left it alone in shame since I DON&rsquo;T DO FAN FICTION WTF EWW IT&rsquo;S SO EMBARRASSING UGH -</p>\n<p>[I&rsquo;m really putting myself out there. Please forgive my blindness.]</p>\n<p>But I had to come back to it a few months later. I had to finish it. For years and years, all this *waving at the beautiful madness* went over my head. Then, I saw David. Oop! It had to happen sometime. Here I am.</p>\n<p>And here it is.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Her heart hammered in her ears.<b><br /></b></p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>She yelled. She didn&rsquo;t mean to yell. It was his eyes, so extraordinarily lovely - the very heart of autumn - were impassive, even as she spilled over in his shitty cabinet of a kitchen, trembling and hyperventilating with emotion. He remained hunched over, silent.</p>\n<p>She flexed her hand. Her wrist was numb. She banged it on his counter, making his cups tinkle. She cursed loud enough to make his neighbors stare as she ran back to her car.</p>\n<p>The echo of what she said filled her with an exhilarating dread. He knew now. She laid everything bare. In her passion she hadn&rsquo;t only spoken her feelings for him, but made no secret of the way she felt about the way he lived his life. </p>\n<p>Drama made her ill. She shivered, although sweat beaded her brow. She licked her lip and tasted salt. She couldn&rsquo;t drive like this. She grabbed her bag on the passenger seat, and for some reason, the act finally broke her.</p>\n<p>Her breathless, strangled groans strengthened quickly to howls. She squeezed her bag in her hands, wrung the empty flaccid thing. Her tears were plentiful and fast, and soon the leather was streaked with saltwater. She looked back at the empty passenger seat and her body stiffened. She couldn&rsquo;t do it a second longer. Wait. Endure.</p>\n<p>She opened the door to run.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; She nearly knocked him over.</p>\n<p>She wiped her eyes violently. &ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; She slammed the door and started down the entrance of his courtyard. The sodium lights made his brown hair flash auburn. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Stop.&rdquo; She kept walking. Her cheeks stung. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go anywhere in that condition. Come inside. I&rsquo;ll make you a cup of tea.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She stopped walking, but didn&rsquo;t turn around.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said. She heard the gravel under his heels, the slight hitch a back injury has caused.</p>\n<p>She looked down at her waterlogged bag, then at the road. She followed him back to his cottage. He closed the door behind her, his delicate hands overly precious on the deadlock. She had wanted, and wondered at his hands. </p>\n<p>Now he knew.</p>\n<p>He walked to the kitchen, ducking his head on the glass fixture that hung too low. It swung softly as he made her favorite. He had made it many times - it was a thoughtless exercise. She ached, but still drank in his silence. The vertical lines between his eyes were deep. His hands were steady, pouring and stirring. The thought of his pity, of a kindness rendered to a friend in pain, made her mouth fill with saliva. She hiccuped.</p>\n<p>He set the cup down in front of her. &ldquo;Drink.&rdquo; He adjusted his worn tie. His jaw clenched, but his eyes were soft. She took the cup in her hand, warm ceramic, rounded and comfortable. There was chip on the lip. She rubbed her bottom lip against it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My neighbor. He said you were crying in your car.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>She swallowed too deeply, and hissed as it burned down her throat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Really loudly.&rdquo; His eyes made her hand tremble. She put the cup down. Rolled her sore eyes. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to cause a disturbance.&rdquo; She meant it. Now that she was empty of passion, her outburst seemed ridiculous. She stood up. &ldquo;Thank you. I&hellip;um&hellip;think I&rsquo;m okay to drive now.&rdquo; She took quick strides to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for everything I said it was ridiculous display <i>I&rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress lately please forget I ever did it-</i>&rdquo; Her words tumbled together. She hit the door running, nearly tore the knob off.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to forget.&rdquo; It was barely louder than breath.</p>\n<p>She stopped cold, turned her head to look at him. He stood by his table, lips parted, with expectant eyes. She was punch drunk.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come inside.&rdquo; He pointed to his sofa. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
