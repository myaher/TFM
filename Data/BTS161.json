Yoongi had betrayed you&hellip;hadn&rsquo;t he? Gone behind your back and fraternized with the enemy? So, that would make him a traitor, no? You just couldn&rsquo;t believe that out of all breeds out there, he chose a Crossroads Demon, the rats of the Supernatural community. His actions should have been laughable, a royal seeking help from the lesser, so why did your heart still ache increasingly so? Why does your lip tremble and why does your throat clog up so painfully? Min Yoongi had so easily been able to tear down the walls you had spent <i>years</i> strengthening, and you should have fought harder. Should have fought longer. But when it came to Yoongi? It&rsquo;s like you forgot who you actually were. He made you anew, and goddammit you hated it. Hated that despite all that you had taught yourself since that fateful day, you let Yoongi steal you away and indulge in you. Could he be considered your Hamartia? The fatal flaw to your expected down fall?</p><p>You stop down near the river bank, staring down at your reflection which distorts and ripples with the flow of the water. All is as calm as everything can be for a short while until another reflection is cast beside your own and your stomach is twisting uncomfortably. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what Stint sees in you.&rdquo; Eleeze snarls, lips curled into a sneer as he looks you up and down the minute you spin around. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a good for nothing runt. I should have took you out the minute I had the chance.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you again Eleeze.&rdquo; You curtly greet, teeth grinding together tightly as you  ball your hands up at your sides. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to ask you just one thing before we officially begin our reunion though&hellip;&rdquo; A dark smirk twists sinfully at your lips, eyes clouding dangerously dark as you jut your chin out and stare up at the towering Satori without a hint of fear. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s stopping you from taking me out right here? Right now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t know when to give up, do you <i>mundane.&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think of giving up,&rdquo; you announce with a dismissive shrug, rolling your shoulders back and pursing your lips bitterly. &ldquo;But then I remember&hellip;&rdquo; You bite at your lower lip coyly. &ldquo;I have a lot of motherfuckers to prove wrong.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Give me your worst&hellip; brat.&rdquo; He warns, watching you bend at your knees and drop your shoulders low and square. </p><p>Something unexpected happens though. Something neither of you anticipate. It leaves Eleeze stunned, but it renders you absolutely petrified. The smell of citrus and rain plagues the otherwise pungent air and it&rsquo;s like your lungs are able to properly expand for the first time since arriving within Gehenna as Eleeze withers subtly away from your frame. Something ignites inside your veins, it flames from your collarbones all the way down to your fingertips and something&hellip; <i>sparks. </i>It&rsquo;s a lethal sensation really, it makes you feel drunk of a forbidden sensation but dammit&hellip;you want more. No! Need more. Somehow, someway, within, you press down onto the feeling and send it surging forward.</p><p>It produces something you so dearly don&rsquo;t expect. </p><p>Light explodes from the very pads of your fingers, spidering it&rsquo;s away across the space left between you and Eleeze before it consumes him whole and a shrill shriek is emitted from his slack jaw. You watch with baited breath as it zig-zaggs from your very hands and scorched the grass beneath you, black. The smell of burning flesh and heated soil replaces the earlier scents of citrus and you fumble nervously to make it stop. Clasping both hands together nervously, you watch the spikes cease to exist and when the smoke clears, Eleeze is revealed to be a fallen, fitting mess. Somebody who foams at the mouth and trembles all over as the electricity still runs rampant within his system.</p><p>Lightning. </p><p>You had just commanded lightning itself. </p><p>&ldquo;As&hellip;<i>expected</i> of Zeus&rsquo; Descendant.&rdquo; </p><p>High of the feeling, you bravely tower over the defeated Satori and reach down to grab at the collar of his shirt, yanking upwards so Eleeze&rsquo;s back arched up off of the ground and he was able to feel the warmth of your breath on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;As expected of what?&rdquo; You hiss, eyes narrowed as Eleeze chuckles breathlessly in your hold.</p><p>&ldquo;You heard me&hellip; brat.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; You darkly muse, fingers coiling tighter against the fabric as you stare down at him. &ldquo;I know I did.&rdquo; Something sparks and something crackles, Eleeze tenses up within you hold until another strike stems fr your fingertips and travels through his collarbones, up his neck and against his temples. The Satori knocks his head back. Dead. Savagely, you drop his limp body and dust your hands off with a mild look of annoyance upon your face. One down. Who knows how many more to go. </p><p>A swift shuffle is heard to your left as well as a low growl, and so its instinct for you to whirl around and poise yourself in a fighters position. Your fingertips tingle and your body feels light with adrenaline which spurs you on the moment a black blur emerges from the south forest by the river bank. Despite being on edge, its appearance and speed takes you completely by surprise and so you can&rsquo;t help the smothered grunt that cracks up your throat when it mercilessly slams against your chest and takes you down. </p><p>You snarl. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; </p><p>Rustling beneath it&rsquo;s weight, you, as gracefully as you can (so basically not at all), twist onto your back and raise outstretched palms to push against the unknown force. Expect&hellip; nothing happens. So instead, you take an ulterior route. Hearing the snapping of jaws right by your ear, you manage to wrangle your legs around this forms neck and squeeze, listening out for a low, groaned whine before raising and twisting your hips to fling the frame away and therefore give you time to stand once more. Heaving for breath, you focus your attention onto the whining canine who stands on trembling legs with a bowed head.</p><p>&ldquo;What the- Tae? What the fuck!?&rdquo; </p><p>Said Church Grim perks up upon being addressed, tongue lolling out of his mouth as his ears flop over and he cocks his head to the side. Cute. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here? Please tell me the others aren&rsquo;t-&rdquo; You cut yourself off, freezing your hands motion withing the canines fur as more noise was heard to the South. Paranoid as ever, you dart up once more and this time raise sparking hands which you intend to use to your full advantage when five other frames emerge from within the forest. You scowl, lips drawn back bitterly. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; You scoff, almost not surprised. Luck was never on your side. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about doing no Greek mojo stuff on me. Nuh uh. No way. I ain&rsquo;t having no family of mine zapping my ass.&rdquo; Seokjin runs a steady hand through his pink locks, lips pursed as he almost dares you to do anything of the sort with just his eyes alone. </p><p>&ldquo;Stand down Y/n.&rdquo; Namjoon orders, a rightful aura surrounding him that a Grim Reaper should withhold, his title was respectful. Namjoon was a person who you greatly looked up to and therefore no matter what you  wanted to believe, you couldn&rsquo;t disobey or go against any of his words. You could already feel the Raven burning upon your back, almost like telling you that even hesitation was something bad. Slowly, you lower your hands and clasp them together as a sign of peace and acceptance. </p><p>&ldquo;None of you should be here right now&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You told Yoongi to keep us back there, you never specified how long for. You orders had loopholes.&rdquo; Hoseok beams slyly and upon hearing the demon&rsquo;s name, you spin around to find where he stands, hands being released and sparking restlessly as a stray bolt smothers Seokjin&rsquo;s warning whilst scorching against the ground and expanding forward to reach out for the foxes feet. Yoongi looks you dead in the eye, almost testing you because he <i>thinks </i>he knows you better than that. He <i>assumes</i> you wouldn&rsquo;t do it. </p><p>How naive of him. </p><p>Your fingers extend, and Yoongi falters with pleading eyes that are masked with feigned arrogance. He was scared&hellip;</p><p>Good. </p><p>The element licks its way up his leg, but it doesn&rsquo;t sting. Oh no. You aren&rsquo;t that callous. Besides, you can&rsquo;t really afford to waste the time when a strangled whine of discomfort slips Jimin&rsquo;s lips and you glance in the Incubus&rsquo; direction to see him puffy eyed and distraught. The light diminishes instantly, something pulls tightly at your heart strings and you count over the frame stood before you whilst Taehyung, now in human form, stands comfortingly by your side. </p><p>Namjoon. Seokjin. Yoongi. Hoseok. Jimin. Jung-</p><p>Where the hell was Jungkook? </p><p>&ldquo;Jimin?&rdquo; You call out, words scraping harshly against your throat as the incubus sniffs and strides over to collapse into your arm, nose pressed against the crook of your neck and suddenly&hellip; you&rsquo;re beginning to wish that what you were assuming had happened, hadn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stint has him. We left the Manor and-and, he was there. He ambushed us, and whilst we were all distracted, he took him.&rdquo; </p><p>You hold the demon at arm&rsquo;s length and see that indeed, a purple hue was beginning to blossom around his left eye and his lip was split. In fact, upon glancing over the remaining five, you noticed that they each all shared their own fair share of battle wounds. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get him back, okay?&rdquo; You whisper softly, afraid that the man stood before you would break at any given moment as you ran your hand across his cheek. &ldquo;I promise you Chim. And you know I never go back on my promises.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I-&rdquo; </p><p>Your eyes darken the minute the fox speaks. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to hear your voice right now <i>fox.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo; Seokjin snaps, voice like a vice as it seizes you with fear. Seokjin was demon neither you nor Jungkook had ever wanted to properly anger. He was too scary. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just addressed that there are more pressing matters to attend to, and until Yoongi is allowed the time to explain himself to you, you are both hereby forbidden from being within each others presence unless there is at least one other person present. Am I understood!?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine with me.&rdquo; You shrug casually. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t exist to me anymore anyway.&rdquo; It was a low blow. You already knew that. But right now, you were just desperate to see whether or not he harbored even the slightest shred of regret over what he had done. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n.&rdquo; Yoongi forlornly calls out but you dismiss him with a flick of your hair and a purse of your lips, turning back to Jimin whose hands you grasp tightly within your own. </p><p>&ldquo;Since he has Jungkook, we will have to do this tactically. We can&rsquo;t just go in blazing since that could jeopardize Jungkook&rsquo;s safety. Understood?&rdquo; </p><p>The Incubus nods, determinedly.</p><p>You smirk. &ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s the plan&hellip;&rdquo; </p>",

Yoongi had betrayed you\u2026hadn\u2019t he? Gone behind your back and fraternized with the enemy? So, that would make him a traitor, no? You just couldn\u2019t believe that out of all breeds out there, he chose a Crossroads Demon, the rats of the Supernatural community. His actions should have been laughable, a royal seeking help from the lesser, so why did your heart still ache increasingly so? Why does your lip tremble and why does your throat clog up so painfully? Min Yoongi had so easily been able to tear down the walls you had spent <i>years</i> strengthening, and you should have fought harder. Should have fought longer. But when it came to Yoongi? It\u2019s like you forgot who you actually were. He made you anew, and goddammit you hated it. Hated that despite all that you had taught yourself since that fateful day, you let Yoongi steal you away and indulge in you. Could he be considered your Hamartia? The fatal flaw to your expected down fall?</p><p>You stop down near the river bank, staring down at your reflection which distorts and ripples with the flow of the water. All is as calm as everything can be for a short while until another reflection is cast beside your own and your stomach is twisting uncomfortably. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what Stint sees in you.\u201d Eleeze snarls, lips curled into a sneer as he looks you up and down the minute you spin around. \u201cYou\u2019re just a good for nothing runt. I should have took you out the minute I had the chance.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again Eleeze.\u201d You curtly greet, teeth grinding together tightly as you  ball your hands up at your sides. \u201cI\u2019ve got to ask you just one thing before we officially begin our reunion though\u2026\u201d A dark smirk twists sinfully at your lips, eyes clouding dangerously dark as you jut your chin out and stare up at the towering Satori without a hint of fear. \u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you from taking me out right here? Right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know when to give up, do you <i>mundane.\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cSometimes I think of giving up,\u201d you announce with a dismissive shrug, rolling your shoulders back and pursing your lips bitterly. \u201cBut then I remember\u2026\u201d You bite at your lower lip coyly. \u201cI have a lot of motherfuckers to prove wrong.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGive me your worst\u2026 brat.\u201d He warns, watching you bend at your knees and drop your shoulders low and square. </p><p>Something unexpected happens though. Something neither of you anticipate. It leaves Eleeze stunned, but it renders you absolutely petrified. The smell of citrus and rain plagues the otherwise pungent air and it\u2019s like your lungs are able to properly expand for the first time since arriving within Gehenna as Eleeze withers subtly away from your frame. Something ignites inside your veins, it flames from your collarbones all the way down to your fingertips and something\u2026 <i>sparks. </i>It\u2019s a lethal sensation really, it makes you feel drunk of a forbidden sensation but dammit\u2026you want more. No! Need more. Somehow, someway, within, you press down onto the feeling and send it surging forward.</p><p>It produces something you so dearly don\u2019t expect. </p><p>Light explodes from the very pads of your fingers, spidering it\u2019s away across the space left between you and Eleeze before it consumes him whole and a shrill shriek is emitted from his slack jaw. You watch with baited breath as it zig-zaggs from your very hands and scorched the grass beneath you, black. The smell of burning flesh and heated soil replaces the earlier scents of citrus and you fumble nervously to make it stop. Clasping both hands together nervously, you watch the spikes cease to exist and when the smoke clears, Eleeze is revealed to be a fallen, fitting mess. Somebody who foams at the mouth and trembles all over as the electricity still runs rampant within his system.</p><p>Lightning. </p><p>You had just commanded lightning itself. </p><p>\u201cAs\u2026<i>expected</i> of Zeus\u2019 Descendant.\u201d </p><p>High of the feeling, you bravely tower over the defeated Satori and reach down to grab at the collar of his shirt, yanking upwards so Eleeze\u2019s back arched up off of the ground and he was able to feel the warmth of your breath on his face. </p><p>\u201cAs expected of what?\u201d You hiss, eyes narrowed as Eleeze chuckles breathlessly in your hold.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me\u2026 brat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You darkly muse, fingers coiling tighter against the fabric as you stare down at him. \u201cI know I did.\u201d Something sparks and something crackles, Eleeze tenses up within you hold until another strike stems fr your fingertips and travels through his collarbones, up his neck and against his temples. The Satori knocks his head back. Dead. Savagely, you drop his limp body and dust your hands off with a mild look of annoyance upon your face. One down. Who knows how many more to go. </p><p>A swift shuffle is heard to your left as well as a low growl, and so its instinct for you to whirl around and poise yourself in a fighters position. Your fingertips tingle and your body feels light with adrenaline which spurs you on the moment a black blur emerges from the south forest by the river bank. Despite being on edge, its appearance and speed takes you completely by surprise and so you can\u2019t help the smothered grunt that cracks up your throat when it mercilessly slams against your chest and takes you down. </p><p>You snarl. \u201cShit!\u201d </p><p>Rustling beneath it\u2019s weight, you, as gracefully as you can (so basically not at all), twist onto your back and raise outstretched palms to push against the unknown force. Expect\u2026 nothing happens. So instead, you take an ulterior route. Hearing the snapping of jaws right by your ear, you manage to wrangle your legs around this forms neck and squeeze, listening out for a low, groaned whine before raising and twisting your hips to fling the frame away and therefore give you time to stand once more. Heaving for breath, you focus your attention onto the whining canine who stands on trembling legs with a bowed head.</p><p>\u201cWhat the- Tae? What the fuck!?\u201d </p><p>Said Church Grim perks up upon being addressed, tongue lolling out of his mouth as his ears flop over and he cocks his head to the side. Cute. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? Please tell me the others aren\u2019t-\u201d You cut yourself off, freezing your hands motion withing the canines fur as more noise was heard to the South. Paranoid as ever, you dart up once more and this time raise sparking hands which you intend to use to your full advantage when five other frames emerge from within the forest. You scowl, lips drawn back bitterly. \u201cOf course.\u201d You scoff, almost not surprised. Luck was never on your side. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about doing no Greek mojo stuff on me. Nuh uh. No way. I ain\u2019t having no family of mine zapping my ass.\u201d Seokjin runs a steady hand through his pink locks, lips pursed as he almost dares you to do anything of the sort with just his eyes alone. </p><p>\u201cStand down Y/n.\u201d Namjoon orders, a rightful aura surrounding him that a Grim Reaper should withhold, his title was respectful. Namjoon was a person who you greatly looked up to and therefore no matter what you  wanted to believe, you couldn\u2019t disobey or go against any of his words. You could already feel the Raven burning upon your back, almost like telling you that even hesitation was something bad. Slowly, you lower your hands and clasp them together as a sign of peace and acceptance. </p><p>\u201cNone of you should be here right now\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou told Yoongi to keep us back there, you never specified how long for. You orders had loopholes.\u201d Hoseok beams slyly and upon hearing the demon\u2019s name, you spin around to find where he stands, hands being released and sparking restlessly as a stray bolt smothers Seokjin\u2019s warning whilst scorching against the ground and expanding forward to reach out for the foxes feet. Yoongi looks you dead in the eye, almost testing you because he <i>thinks </i>he knows you better than that. He <i>assumes</i> you wouldn\u2019t do it. </p><p>How naive of him. </p><p>Your fingers extend, and Yoongi falters with pleading eyes that are masked with feigned arrogance. He was scared\u2026</p><p>Good. </p><p>The element licks its way up his leg, but it doesn\u2019t sting. Oh no. You aren\u2019t that callous. Besides, you can\u2019t really afford to waste the time when a strangled whine of discomfort slips Jimin\u2019s lips and you glance in the Incubus\u2019 direction to see him puffy eyed and distraught. The light diminishes instantly, something pulls tightly at your heart strings and you count over the frame stood before you whilst Taehyung, now in human form, stands comfortingly by your side. </p><p>Namjoon. Seokjin. Yoongi. Hoseok. Jimin. Jung-</p><p>Where the hell was Jungkook? </p><p>\u201cJimin?\u201d You call out, words scraping harshly against your throat as the incubus sniffs and strides over to collapse into your arm, nose pressed against the crook of your neck and suddenly\u2026 you\u2019re beginning to wish that what you were assuming had happened, hadn\u2019t. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d </p><p>\u201cStint has him. We left the Manor and-and, he was there. He ambushed us, and whilst we were all distracted, he took him.\u201d </p><p>You hold the demon at arm\u2019s length and see that indeed, a purple hue was beginning to blossom around his left eye and his lip was split. In fact, upon glancing over the remaining five, you noticed that they each all shared their own fair share of battle wounds. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get him back, okay?\u201d You whisper softly, afraid that the man stood before you would break at any given moment as you ran your hand across his cheek. \u201cI promise you Chim. And you know I never go back on my promises.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/n, I-\u201d </p><p>Your eyes darken the minute the fox speaks. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear your voice right now <i>fox.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Seokjin snaps, voice like a vice as it seizes you with fear. Seokjin was demon neither you nor Jungkook had ever wanted to properly anger. He was too scary. \u201cWe\u2019ve just addressed that there are more pressing matters to attend to, and until Yoongi is allowed the time to explain himself to you, you are both hereby forbidden from being within each others presence unless there is at least one other person present. Am I understood!?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me.\u201d You shrug casually. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t exist to me anymore anyway.\u201d It was a low blow. You already knew that. But right now, you were just desperate to see whether or not he harbored even the slightest shred of regret over what he had done. </p><p>\u201cY/n.\u201d Yoongi forlornly calls out but you dismiss him with a flick of your hair and a purse of your lips, turning back to Jimin whose hands you grasp tightly within your own. </p><p>\u201cSince he has Jungkook, we will have to do this tactically. We can\u2019t just go in blazing since that could jeopardize Jungkook\u2019s safety. Understood?\u201d </p><p>The Incubus nods, determinedly.</p><p>You smirk. \u201cAlright, here\u2019s the plan\u2026\u201d </p></p>",

Yoongi had betrayed you&hellip;hadn&rsquo;t he? Gone behind your back and fraternized with the enemy? So, that would make him a traitor, no? You just couldn&rsquo;t believe that out of all breeds out there, he chose a Crossroads Demon, the rats of the Supernatural community. His actions should have been laughable, a royal seeking help from the lesser, so why did your heart still ache increasingly so? Why does your lip tremble and why does your throat clog up so painfully? Min Yoongi had so easily been able to tear down the walls you had spent <i>years</i> strengthening, and you should have fought harder. Should have fought longer. But when it came to Yoongi? It&rsquo;s like you forgot who you actually were. He made you anew, and goddammit you hated it. Hated that despite all that you had taught yourself since that fateful day, you let Yoongi steal you away and indulge in you. Could he be considered your Hamartia? The fatal flaw to your expected down fall?</p><p>You stop down near the river bank, staring down at your reflection which distorts and ripples with the flow of the water. All is as calm as everything can be for a short while until another reflection is cast beside your own and your stomach is twisting uncomfortably. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what Stint sees in you.&rdquo; Eleeze snarls, lips curled into a sneer as he looks you up and down the minute you spin around. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a good for nothing runt. I should have took you out the minute I had the chance.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you again Eleeze.&rdquo; You curtly greet, teeth grinding together tightly as you  ball your hands up at your sides. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to ask you just one thing before we officially begin our reunion though&hellip;&rdquo; A dark smirk twists sinfully at your lips, eyes clouding dangerously dark as you jut your chin out and stare up at the towering Satori without a hint of fear. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s stopping you from taking me out right here? Right now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t know when to give up, do you <i>mundane.&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think of giving up,&rdquo; you announce with a dismissive shrug, rolling your shoulders back and pursing your lips bitterly. &ldquo;But then I remember&hellip;&rdquo; You bite at your lower lip coyly. &ldquo;I have a lot of motherfuckers to prove wrong.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Give me your worst&hellip; brat.&rdquo; He warns, watching you bend at your knees and drop your shoulders low and square. </p><p>Something unexpected happens though. Something neither of you anticipate. It leaves Eleeze stunned, but it renders you absolutely petrified. The smell of citrus and rain plagues the otherwise pungent air and it&rsquo;s like your lungs are able to properly expand for the first time since arriving within Gehenna as Eleeze withers subtly away from your frame. Something ignites inside your veins, it flames from your collarbones all the way down to your fingertips and something&hellip; <i>sparks. </i>It&rsquo;s a lethal sensation really, it makes you feel drunk of a forbidden sensation but dammit&hellip;you want more. No! Need more. Somehow, someway, within, you press down onto the feeling and send it surging forward.</p><p>It produces something you so dearly don&rsquo;t expect. </p><p>Light explodes from the very pads of your fingers, spidering it&rsquo;s away across the space left between you and Eleeze before it consumes him whole and a shrill shriek is emitted from his slack jaw. You watch with baited breath as it zig-zaggs from your very hands and scorched the grass beneath you, black. The smell of burning flesh and heated soil replaces the earlier scents of citrus and you fumble nervously to make it stop. Clasping both hands together nervously, you watch the spikes cease to exist and when the smoke clears, Eleeze is revealed to be a fallen, fitting mess. Somebody who foams at the mouth and trembles all over as the electricity still runs rampant within his system.</p><p>Lightning. </p><p>You had just commanded lightning itself. </p><p>&ldquo;As&hellip;<i>expected</i> of Zeus&rsquo; Descendant.&rdquo; </p><p>High of the feeling, you bravely tower over the defeated Satori and reach down to grab at the collar of his shirt, yanking upwards so Eleeze&rsquo;s back arched up off of the ground and he was able to feel the warmth of your breath on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;As expected of what?&rdquo; You hiss, eyes narrowed as Eleeze chuckles breathlessly in your hold.</p><p>&ldquo;You heard me&hellip; brat.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; You darkly muse, fingers coiling tighter against the fabric as you stare down at him. &ldquo;I know I did.&rdquo; Something sparks and something crackles, Eleeze tenses up within you hold until another strike stems fr your fingertips and travels through his collarbones, up his neck and against his temples. The Satori knocks his head back. Dead. Savagely, you drop his limp body and dust your hands off with a mild look of annoyance upon your face. One down. Who knows how many more to go. </p><p>A swift shuffle is heard to your left as well as a low growl, and so its instinct for you to whirl around and poise yourself in a fighters position. Your fingertips tingle and your body feels light with adrenaline which spurs you on the moment a black blur emerges from the south forest by the river bank. Despite being on edge, its appearance and speed takes you completely by surprise and so you can&rsquo;t help the smothered grunt that cracks up your throat when it mercilessly slams against your chest and takes you down. </p><p>You snarl. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; </p><p>Rustling beneath it&rsquo;s weight, you, as gracefully as you can (so basically not at all), twist onto your back and raise outstretched palms to push against the unknown force. Expect&hellip; nothing happens. So instead, you take an ulterior route. Hearing the snapping of jaws right by your ear, you manage to wrangle your legs around this forms neck and squeeze, listening out for a low, groaned whine before raising and twisting your hips to fling the frame away and therefore give you time to stand once more. Heaving for breath, you focus your attention onto the whining canine who stands on trembling legs with a bowed head.</p><p>&ldquo;What the- Tae? What the fuck!?&rdquo; </p><p>Said Church Grim perks up upon being addressed, tongue lolling out of his mouth as his ears flop over and he cocks his head to the side. Cute. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here? Please tell me the others aren&rsquo;t-&rdquo; You cut yourself off, freezing your hands motion withing the canines fur as more noise was heard to the South. Paranoid as ever, you dart up once more and this time raise sparking hands which you intend to use to your full advantage when five other frames emerge from within the forest. You scowl, lips drawn back bitterly. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; You scoff, almost not surprised. Luck was never on your side. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about doing no Greek mojo stuff on me. Nuh uh. No way. I ain&rsquo;t having no family of mine zapping my ass.&rdquo; Seokjin runs a steady hand through his pink locks, lips pursed as he almost dares you to do anything of the sort with just his eyes alone. </p><p>&ldquo;Stand down Y/n.&rdquo; Namjoon orders, a rightful aura surrounding him that a Grim Reaper should withhold, his title was respectful. Namjoon was a person who you greatly looked up to and therefore no matter what you  wanted to believe, you couldn&rsquo;t disobey or go against any of his words. You could already feel the Raven burning upon your back, almost like telling you that even hesitation was something bad. Slowly, you lower your hands and clasp them together as a sign of peace and acceptance. </p><p>&ldquo;None of you should be here right now&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You told Yoongi to keep us back there, you never specified how long for. You orders had loopholes.&rdquo; Hoseok beams slyly and upon hearing the demon&rsquo;s name, you spin around to find where he stands, hands being released and sparking restlessly as a stray bolt smothers Seokjin&rsquo;s warning whilst scorching against the ground and expanding forward to reach out for the foxes feet. Yoongi looks you dead in the eye, almost testing you because he <i>thinks </i>he knows you better than that. He <i>assumes</i> you wouldn&rsquo;t do it. </p><p>How naive of him. </p><p>Your fingers extend, and Yoongi falters with pleading eyes that are masked with feigned arrogance. He was scared&hellip;</p><p>Good. </p><p>The element licks its way up his leg, but it doesn&rsquo;t sting. Oh no. You aren&rsquo;t that callous. Besides, you can&rsquo;t really afford to waste the time when a strangled whine of discomfort slips Jimin&rsquo;s lips and you glance in the Incubus&rsquo; direction to see him puffy eyed and distraught. The light diminishes instantly, something pulls tightly at your heart strings and you count over the frame stood before you whilst Taehyung, now in human form, stands comfortingly by your side. </p><p>Namjoon. Seokjin. Yoongi. Hoseok. Jimin. Jung-</p><p>Where the hell was Jungkook? </p><p>&ldquo;Jimin?&rdquo; You call out, words scraping harshly against your throat as the incubus sniffs and strides over to collapse into your arm, nose pressed against the crook of your neck and suddenly&hellip; you&rsquo;re beginning to wish that what you were assuming had happened, hadn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stint has him.

It was an\nhonor to be asked to represent the company in such a big mission and at first\nyou were hesitant towards accepting the offer\u2026 but you would return. </p><p>The return\nwould be your comfort when times were tough.</p><p>When you\nreturned, you would\u2019ve have pocketed a large sum of money that came with the\nmission as well.</p><p>Travel\naround was something you\u2019d always wanted to do and the various businesses would\nfor sure show you around and introduce you to their cultures\u2026 but you were\nstill upset.</p><p>The fact\nthat your best friend hadn\u2019t waved you off\u2026 hurt.</p><p>You\nwouldn\u2019t be seeing him for months\u2026 and he didn\u2019t come to say good bye?</p><p>Did you not\nmean more to him?</p><p>Your\ncomfort was that this trip would help your feelings die down. </p><p>You didn\u2019t\nknow why it had taken you so long to realize how much he meant to you and how\nin love you were\u2026 suppressed feelings had spilled over the rim and your heart had\nbegun to ache.</p><p>His smile\nmade you blush and his eyes made your knees weak when they looked your way\u2026</p><p>He was\ncausing you trouble! Clouding your mind constantly, intruding on your dreams\nand making you long for something so close, but felt so far away.</p><p>He meant\nthe world to you.</p><p>Maybe not\nhaving him say good bye was for the better\u2026 because he was the only reason\nyou\u2019d stay.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You had\nbeen gone for three days now.</p><p>Taehyung\nhad received a text, informing him that you were safely on the ground, making\nhis heart sting with even more guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\ncome back soon!\u201d Was his response.</p><p>A big lie.</p><p>His heart\nscreamed \u201cCome back now!

It was a lot of information to take in and take notes of but in the\nafternoon you\u2019d have time to look around the city before dinner and relax,\nwhich you did.</p><p>When you\nreturned to the hotel later that evening you posted some pictures you had taken\nof the city on Instagram. As your finger hit post on the last photo your phone\nsuddenly rang.</p><p>You had to\nfly back to Italy, ASAP.</p><p>Your\ncompany had booked you onto the first flight the next morning. You were meant\nto take a flight to Prague in two days! Those two days leading up would\u2019ve been\nyour first two days off since leaving!</p><p>You felt\nstressed and quickly clicked into your messaging app and began typing out a\nlong rant to Taehyung to ease your mind.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The young\nwoman working behind the counter jumped when Taehyung suddenly accidently\nslammed his passport on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the\nnext flight to Prague from here?\u201d He panted, out of breath.</p><p>She began\ntyping on her computer.</p><p>Taehyung\nhad been waiting 4 hours now instead of 2.</p><p>His flight\nwas delayed.</p><p>A miracle\nor else he would\u2019ve seen your text when he was in Finland.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a\nflight tomorrow at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\nwant to know the price?\u201d</p><p>He already\nput his card in the machine.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\nmatter.\u201d</p><p>She told\nhim the price but he didn\u2019t take in any of the information she was giving.</p><p>All he\nwanted were his new tickets and something to eat.</p><p>\u201cCan you\ncancel my connection to Helsinki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\nrefundable sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\njust give the seat to anyone who needs it.\u201d He said, took his ticket and left.</p><p>While\neating at the first appetizing place he could find he studied his ticket.</p><p>\u201cFirst\nclass.\u201d</p><p>He rolled\nhis eyes.</p><p>Money\nwasn\u2019t an issue, all he wanted was to get to you and tell him he was sorry\u2026 </p><p>and that he\nloves you.</p><p>His phone\nsuddenly rang.</p><p>Jimin.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\nwhat the fuck!?\u201d</p><p>He had seen\nhis text\u2026</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\ncrazy, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmsterdam.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You tried\nto call Taehyung but you only got sent to voicemail.</p><p>Was his\nphone off?</p><p>You sighed.</p><p>You missed\nhim.</p><p>You wanted\nto hear his voice.</p><p>The\nemergency in Italy was solved and you were now waiting at the airport in Rome\nto board your flight that would take you directly to Prague and then to Kiev.</p><p>The visit\nin Prague was moved on their behalf and thus your company immediately put you\non the next flight to Ukraine instead.

Was eating breakfast or dinner? Your tired head couldn\u2019t\ncome around to figure out what the time was for him\u2026 Stop thinking about him!\nYou yelled in your head.</p><p>You boarded\nyour flight and it quickly took you to Prague.</p><p>You sent a\ntext to Taehyung, hesitating at first but you promised you\u2019d always let him\nknow whenever you were back on the ground.</p><p>\u201cIn Prague,\nflying to Kiev in an hour and a half.

Book a flight to Oslo and take in\nat a hotel for the night and freshen up and sleep. That was his new plan.</p><p>He walked\npast a tiny caf\u00e9 on his way out and glanced over it when he suddenly froze,\nheart stopping.</p><p>There was a\nglass wall in front of the caf\u00e9, the only way in was via the passport control\u2026</p><p>You were\nthere.</p><p>Sitting at\none of the tables with an empty plate in front of you and your phone in your\nhands\u2026 crying.</p><p>You wiped\nthe back of your hand across your cheek and put your phone down.</p><p>He quickly\nescaped out of your sight, holding his fist pressed against his mouth,\ndesperate to stop the tears that were welling up.</p><p>Why were\nyou crying?</p><p>Was it his\nfault?</p><p>You were\nthere all the time\u2026</p><p>He wanted\nto run to you, run and comfort you, hold you close and kiss every tear away\u2026\nbut he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>You thought\nhe was in Korea.</p><p>He had lied\nto you.</p><p>He looked back\nat you, wishing you\u2019d accidently see him\u2026 force him to explain\u2026 but his legs\nmanaged to carry him the way to the exit.</p><p>Taehyung\nwalked with a heavy heart out of the airport, passing by the ticket offices and\nneglecting them. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just\nbook it on my phone\u2026\u201d He thought.</p><p>All he\nwanted was to shower and lie down now.</p><p>He searched\nup the nearest hotel on his phone and luckily there was an airport hotel right\nnearby.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nhave any rooms available for one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do!\nWould you like a single or double room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle\nplease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\n1600 koruna for one night.

Did his phone die?</p><p>A second\nmore and you would\u2019ve started considering going back home until he hinted on\nvisiting you.</p><p>You wanted\nto call him back again and convince him to come visit you! You wanted him here\nwith you and for once it felt like he really was there and then suddenly he\nwasn\u2019t.</p><p>You gave\nup.</p><p>Your\nfeelings weren\u2019t going to go away, not like this.</p><p>A tear\nescaped your eye and ran down your cheek.</p><p>You cursed\nsilently.</p><p>Why did\nyour heart have to love him of all people\u2026?</p><p>A dumb\nquestion.</p><p>But this\nwas breaking your heart and you needed to board your flight soon.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The bed\nfelt soft against his bare back.</p><p>Taehyung\nlied down on the bed with a towel wrapped around his hips after his long\nshower.</p><p>He reached\nfor his phone and began to click through to the booking site.</p><p>The shower\nhelped him calm down and collect his thoughts. </p><p>All he\nneeded now was a good night\u2019s sleep and everything would be ok. He convinced\nhimself.</p><p>One night\nmeant you\u2019d be on your way to Norway tomorrow\u2026</p><p>-No flights\navailable, please check other dates-</p><p>The day\nafter tomorrow\u2026</p><p>There was\none flight, late.</p><p>He quickly\nbooked it.</p><p>Two nights\nin Prague\u2026 and getting up there another way would be a hassle. He didn\u2019t know\nwhat trains to take and driving was the last thing he would want to do alone in\na foreign country.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The\nmeetings in Kiev were long and you were hungry.</p><p>The bosses\nof the company did their very best to impress you and it all sounded good but\non an empty stomach it was hard for you to concentrate.</p><p>You knew\nthat if you mentioned lunch, lunch would be served. The places you had visited\nso far showed a concerning amount of respect towards you, almost as if they\nwere intimidated by you\u2026 which they should be, but you\u2019re a human too. Sure you\nrepresented a large company that had the upper hand of all of them, a bad\nimpression on you could cause them so much trouble but so far you hadn\u2019t\nstumbled upon anything besides the incident in Italy that was of concern.</p><p>The host of\nthe meeting announced a five minute break and you took your chance. You\napproached the older man and asked him when lunch would be served and suddenly\nthe schedule was shifted.</p><p>The other\nparticipants looked confused for a moment when he suddenly announced that he\nmeant lunch instead, not a five minute coffee break.</p><p>On your way\nto the cafeteria in the building you fished your phone out of your pocket and\nhad a quick glance.</p><p>No missed\ncalls.</p><p>Your heart\nsunk in your chest.</p><p>But now\nwasn\u2019t the time to concern yourself about him, you were here for work.</p><p>You\nshrugged the thoughts of Taehyung off.</p><p>Forget him.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung\nwalked around the city, admiring the old buildings and taking a few photos.</p><p>He brought\nhis camera along\u2026 just in case. He was happy and thankful for his decision.</p><p>While in\nthe center of town he also stopped by a few shops to by himself some more and\nwarmer clothes. Strolling through the streets he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what\nit would be like to be here with you\u2026 You could go sightseeing together, hold\nhands, do some fun shopping and go to nice restaurants, take cute couple photos\nby the river\u2026 look at the old castle\u2026</p><p>He felt\nlonely.</p><p>Should he\ncall you?</p><p>He decided\nno and instead called Jimin while walking back towards the bus stop to get back\nto the airport hotel.</p><p>Jimin\ndidn\u2019t pick up.</p><p>Not a\nsurprise considering that it was in the middle of the night over there.</p><p>If he\ncalled you, you\u2019d know that it was in the middle of the night\u2026</p><p>He got on\nthe bus and put his headphones instead to listen to some music. He scrolled\nthrough Instagram during the bus ride and came across your photos from Estonia\nand now Kiev.</p><p>He liked\nthem and realized a second later that you\u2019d see that he had.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\nnever mind.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Your head\nhit the pillow hard after the long day.</p><p>Despite\nbeing tired you had agreed on following them out for a late night outing only\nto then leave it early and excuse yourself with that your flight was early the\nnext day, when it in fact was mid-day.</p><p>Your feet\nwere aching and resting on the bed was such a relief.</p><p>You felt\nstressed and exhausted, but your feed made it look like you were having the\nbest of times seeing all these places.</p><p>Your phone\nlit up every now and then from the few like of your photos of Kiev and to your\nsurprise you saw Taehyung\u2019s name among them.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t\nhe be sleeping?\u201d</p><p>You quickly\nsent him a text.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nawake?\u201d</p><p>After a\nlonger while he finally responded.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nsleep :(\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsleeping troubles are worrying me. Do you drink tea before bed? It might help\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try\nit. Don\u2019t worry about me though.\u201d</p><p>Whenever he\ntold you not to worry while you were worrying, it made you feel frustrated.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung I\nwill worry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok~\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop\ntexting me and go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cno\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cno\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to reply anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll\ncry myself to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop haha\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you\na lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you\ntoo, but you still need to sleep. We can face time tomorrow when you wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is your\nflight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u2026\nwe can face time when I\u2019ve landed maybe? My flight is during the morning for\nyou.\u201d</p><p>It took him\nlonger to reply this time.</p><p>\u201cok\u201d</p><p>You wanted\nto send him something affectionate\u2026 but you couldn\u2019t get yourself to do it with\nease.</p><p>Perhaps a heart?\nA heart could be platonic\u2026</p><p>\u201c\u2764\u201d</p><p>\u201d\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u201d</p><p>So much\nfor trying to get over him\u2026</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Would you figure out his\ncryptic message? Was it obvious that the hearts were meant to stand for \u201cI love\nu\u201d? </p><p>It was getting harder and\nharder for him to contain himself.</p><p>All he wanted was for his\nflight to Norway to come sooner\u2026 so he could hold you.</p><p>He was letting himself go\neven more, more than he already had. Maybe call it accidental flirting but deep\ndown it was intentional.</p><p>\u201cI miss you so much.\u201d He\nsent, trying to come across as pleading.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you wave\nme off?\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Maybe anger would do? Yes,\nanger.</p><p>If you boiled up anger\ntowards him maybe it would be easier to let him go\u2026 but to what use? Did you\nwant to return home to him not being your friend anymore? </p><p>You instantly regretted\nsending that.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought I\nwouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d He typed out, being honest but then deleting\nthe later and only sending that he was sorry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I understand if\nyou were busy.\u201d</p><p>That reply made him feel\neven worse.</p><p>\u201cPlease wait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait for me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>He placed his phone on the\nnightstand and it dinged when you responded but he didn\u2019t bother to look,\nassuming it was just a good night which back despite it being evening.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Your plane touched down in\nOslo on time and you were picked up by a pre-booked taxi to take you to your\nhotel near the business district.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung anxiously tried to\nwaste his time before his flight.</p><p>He locked his tiny suitcase\nin a locker at the airport and headed into town one last time.</p><p>Should he buy you a gift?</p><p>He walked past a few\njewelry shops and the idea intrigued him more and more.</p><p>What if you wouldn\u2019t like\nit?</p><p>Maybe you didn\u2019t want him\nto visit?</p><p>But you said you missed\nhim\u2026</p><p>He stopped in front of the\nwindow of a shop and his eyes caught the attention of one of the rings\ndisplayed on a piece of red velvet fabric.</p><p>A ring?</p><p>Maybe it looked too much\nlike an engagement ring\u2026</p><p>A thought suddenly struck\nhim but he quickly shrugged it off and continued walking.</p><p>He walked into a clothing\nstore instead and looked at the scarves and gloves\u2026 were you cold?</p><p>Did you have plenty of warm\nclothes with you?</p><p>You could borrow his scarf\nif you were cold\u2026 like you did once.</p><p>He suddenly found himself\nsurrounded with baby clothes, haven accidently walked into the kids section,\ndistracted with thoughts.</p><p>A tiny pair of gloves\ncaught his attention and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from feeling the soft fabric.</p><p>/Why am I so dumb\u2026?/</p><p>He sighed and left the\nstore.</p><p>Maybe he should just get to\nthe airport early and wait there instead\u2026</p><p>It felt like the whole town\nwas suddenly crowded with couples and families, all happy people in love\nsurrounding him\u2026</p><p>His heart was aching and he\nquickly fled towards the bus stop to head to the airport.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The business you were\nvisiting had surprisingly prepared a boat ride in the fjord for all the\nparticipants, something that had you very excited. The boat would take you to a\nconference center where you\u2019d have a few meetings. Before that you had already\nbeen shown around the facility and gotten answers on all of your questions. The\nday would end with a big dinner later that evening.</p><p>The rain was hanging in the\nclouds but it had yet to fall over the city when you all climbed onboard the\nboat.</p><p>You eagerly took pictures\nof the beautiful scenery and quickly sent one to Taehyung. </p><p>You chatted with one of the\nparticipants and he eagerly told you about their food culture and the history\nof fishing.</p><p>It was a beautiful city, a\nlot smaller to the size than you had expected, but still stunning nonetheless.\nIt had certain serenity and calm that wasn\u2019t common for capitals.</p><p>You wanted to return.</p><p>Luckily you had your few\nfree days to spend here before you headed to France.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>As the plane approached\nthere was a stunning view of city lights. </p><p>The lights became fewer and\nfewer the lower the plane flew and the occasional light appeared again when it\nflew over a highway. A mere moment later the colorful lights of the runway were\nin sight and the plane touched down with a gentle thud.</p><p>He hurried off the plane,\ngot a stamp in his passport by the border and grabbed the first taxi to take\nhim into the city.</p><p>There was no time to waste.</p><p>He walked into the first\nhotel he could find and paid for three nights.</p><p>The hotel was large and\nlavish looking and not too far away was the royal palace.</p><p>Taehyung dropped his bag\noff in his room quickly and then ran out into the night.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The dinner had come to an\nend and you were all saying your goodbyes. According to your phone your hotel\nwas a short walk from where you had been eating so you decided to enjoy the\ncool midnight air with a walk back.</p><p>The streets were empty and\nlit up by shop windows and street lights.</p><p>A cold wind from the fjord\nwhistled through the city, making you shiver and pull your coat tighter around\nyou.</p><p>Your phone suddenly rang.</p><p>You heart skipped a beat\nwhen you read Taehyung\u2019s name on the screen. You had forgotten that you were\ngoing to face time when you landed! You groaned in annoyance at yourself and\nquickly picked up.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhere are you!?\u201d He\nscreamed, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I\u2019m in Oslo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere!?\u201d</p><p>You looked around.</p><p>\u201cNear the train station\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung what\u2019s the\nmatter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay there!\u201d He cried\nout.</p><p>Your heartbeat increased\nand you began to feel unsafe.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung this isn\u2019t\nfunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the train station!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, ok\u2026 I\u2019m going, but\nwhy?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, all you\ncould hear was his uneasy breathing, making it sound like he was running.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>He could see the train\nstation, but not you.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d He asked\nagain.</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t know, it says\noe\u2026\u00f8stbanehallen on the building.\u201d You said, struggling to pronounce it. \u201cIt\u2019s\nwhite and there\u2019s a statue in front of it. Why are you asking?\u201d</p><p>He started running again,\naround the corner of the large building, desperate to find you.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cTaehyung? Hello?\u201d You\nrepeated, you were getting cold and you wanted to go back, what was he doing?</p><p>The phone call cut off.</p><p>You looked at your phone\nwith a confused expression and put it back in your pocket as you began to walk\nagain.</p><p>But you were stopped by the\ncall of your name.</p><p>You turned around at the\nsound of the familiar voice, in disbelief.</p><p> \u201cTaehyung?!\u201d</p><p>He was running towards you,\nhis phone dead in his hand, breathing heavily and tears streaming down his\nface.</p><p>His strong arms wrapped\naround your waist and pulled you close and cried out against your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cF- finally\u2026\u201d He panted.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nYou asked, hugging him back. </p><p>Holding back the tears of relief\nfrom seeing him, feeling his arms around you and his sudden presence was\ndifficult. One tear managed to escape your eye at first and you sniffled\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cSomething I should\u2019ve done\nlong ago!\u201d He cried.</p><p>His cold hands suddenly\ngrabbed the sides of your face and before you could react his lips crashed\nagainst yours.</p><p>There was no turning back\nnow.</p><p>The bottle overflowing with\nfeeling for him had been kicked over and smashed.</p><p>You held your arms around\nhim tighter and pressed back against the kiss, tears falling freely.</p><p>He pulled back, your lips\nmaking a low smack sound and his hands still on the sides of your face when he\nlooked you deeply in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d You\nalmost whispered, drowned out by your tears.</p><p>He kissed you again and one\nof his hands fell to your side.</p><p>His kiss was passionate and\nfilled with desire\u2026 making out with you, releasing all suppressed feelings.</p><p>\u201cDid you come all this way\nto tell me that?\u201d You sniffed, when he pulled away again.</p><p>\u201cand that I\u2019m sorry for not\nwaving you off, I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you showed up I\nwould\u2019ve stayed.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and stroked his\nthumb across your cheekbone to wipe your tears away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was better that I\nshowed up here instead.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and leaned in to\nkiss him more.</p><p>You pressed your forehead\nagainst his.</p><p>\u201cYou must be so tired\u2026\u201d You\nsniffled.</p><p>\u201cI rested when I was in\nPrague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in Prague?\u201d</p><p>\u201cand Amsterdam to go to\nEstonia and then cancelled my flight and rebooked on the spot to Prague\ninstead.\u201d He giggled. \u201cI chased you all this way&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\u2026\u201d You looked up\ninto his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d You giggled through the tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy for you.\u201d He\nkissed your forehead.</p><p>\u201cI almost had you in Prague\nbut I arrived at the wrong terminal and they wouldn\u2019t let me through\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 we facetimed\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hid in the bathroom so\nyou wouldn\u2019t see where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy- Why didn\u2019t you just\ntell me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you in\nperson.\u201d</p><p>You hid your face against\nhis chest.</p><p>His hand patted your head\nsoothingly and you stayed like that for a while.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d\nYou asked, looking back up at him.</p><p>\u201cThe grand, I think it was\ncalled.

He crawled up on top of you on the bed and slipped\nhis tongue between your plump lips.</p><p>You wanted him.</p><p>He wanted you.</p><p>His hands moved up your\nsides, caressing your skin from your hip to your waist and up along the sides\nof your chest until he reached your breasts. He cupped each in one hand and\nsqueezed gently, making you let out a soft low moan against the kiss, arousal\ngrowing even stronger.</p><p>Your hands played with his\nlong soft hair, turning the neat curled style into a fluffed up mess while he\nexplored every surface of your breasts, fondling, squeezing, feeling\u2026 </p><p>His thumb and index pinched\nlightly at your left nipple, awakening your arousal even more and stronger and\nyou felt yourself getting wet under his touch.</p><p>He pulled away from the\nkiss and latched on to your right nipple, sucking on it roughly and pulling\ngently with his lips to make it even harder for him.</p><p>His other hand replaced his\nlips, pinching and twisting ever so gently while he hid his face in the crook\nbetween your neck and shoulder, placing soft kisses against your skin.</p><p>The touch of his soft wet\nlips tickled slightly and made you squirm.</p><p>He chuckled lightly at your\nreaction and playfully nibbled your skin, but enough to make it develop into a\nsmall bruised mark.</p><p>He moved up to your ear\nlobe instead and nibbled at it gently and let his hands fall to the sides of\nyou instead to support his body.</p><p>You pushed him over, rolling\non top of him, seated over his hips.</p><p>He looked up at you with\nwide eyes and a surprised expression.</p><p>You walked your hands up\nhis bare chest and leaned down by his ear, teasingly repeating his own move and\nsucking softly at his ear lobe, tugging at it gently with your lips. </p><p>A giggle tickled his ear.</p><p>You had your left hand\nagainst the side of his thick neck, caressing it passionately and feeling his\nsmooth skin.</p><p>He seemed to like it,\nlooking up at you with dark eyes and a wide smirk.</p><p>His hands travelled up your\nthighs while your lips trailed kisses down his neck to his collarbone.</p><p>You gently squeezed your\nleft hand around his neck, earning a low moan.</p><p>You sat up straight, hands\npressed against his chest. When you lowered yourself to sit on him you felt his\nhard bulge poke you through his black jeans. You climbed off him instead and he\nwas quick to tackle you and get back on top.</p><p>You reached for his belt\nbuckle and pulled at it a few times before unbuckling his belt. Taehyung placed\na kiss on your lips and sat up on his knees over you and unzipped his jeans,\npulling them down his thighs, exposing his hard cock straining against the\nfabric of his boxers.</p><p>He got off you and quickly\ntook his jeans off, kicking them off the bed, leaving you in an equal amount of\nclothing. Getting back on top his lips immediately found yours and he kissed\nyou passionately, lips sucking on lips, tongue swirling around tongue, quickly\nbecoming a mess.</p><p>He pulled away, not far.\nHis nose brushed against yours and his hand cupped the side of your face. His\nthumb caressed your lower lip, dragging across it slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d He\nwhispered.</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful\u2026\u201d He pressed\nhis forehead against yours.</p><p>Your fingers found the hem\nof his boxers and pulled them down slowly as far as you could before he stood\nup straight on his knees again, touch abandoning you.</p><p>He hooked his finger under\nthe side of your panties and began to slip them down your legs as far as\npossible before he got off of you and yanked them off completely.</p><p>His hands reached for\nhimself, sliding his boxers down his hips, exposing himself.</p><p>He grabbed his thick cock\nwith one hand after successfully getting rid of the last remaining piece of\nclothing keeping you apart.</p><p>The tip was slightly pink,\nbegging for touch, achingly hard and aroused.</p><p>A few subtle veins trailed\nup his length from the very base of his cock.</p><p>He looked good\u2026</p><p>Aren\u2019t people the most\nattractive when they\u2019re aroused and horny?</p><p>His hand slowly stroked\nhimself and he swallowed, looking down at you.</p><p>You sat up, grabbed his\nshoulder and pushed him back down on the bed, straddling him.</p><p>His hand immediately left\nhis cock, making it fall against his lower abdomen as both his hands grabbed\nyour waist.</p><p>You positioned yourself and\nbegan to grind gently against his cock, making him bite his lip. Sliding up and\ndown his lengths, coating him with your arousal that was just making you more\nand more wet, aching for relief.</p><p>You had your hands pressed\nagainst his chest, one of Taehyung\u2019s hands left your waist to caress your wrist\ninstead. You stopped your movements and leaned down to kiss him.</p><p>A final kiss before you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to contain yourself anymore\u2026</p><p>You pulled away, leaving\nhim needy for your lips to return. You reached down and wrapped your hand\ngently around his cock, dragging the tip up and down your slit a few times before\nyou lowered yourself, positioning the tip by your entrance and sliding down his\nthick length halfway.</p><p>Your hand returned to his\nchest and he thrusted upwards, desperate to slip in further, for you to take\nhis full length. Your nails scratched his skin softly and you let him slide in\nall the way, stretching you out. He felt so good\u2026</p><p>You pushed yourself up and\nlowered yourself back down again, picking up a slow pace. He exhaled deeply\nunder you as you began to ride him faster, sliding up and down half his length before\nyou pushed down all the way, making both of you let out a whimpering moan. You\npicked up your speed fast, sliding up and down his thick cock from right\nbeneath his head to the very base. </p><p>His big hands grabbed your\nhips, guiding you and making it even harder to contain the sounds of pleasure needing\nto escape your throat.</p><p>You leaned your head back,\nsmiling widely as pleasure took over all your senses. You felt sexy riding him\nlike this\u2026</p><p>You grabbed his hand from\nyour hip and locked your fingers with his, pressing his hand back against the\nbed, doing the same with the other and leaning down to kiss him.</p><p>He moaned against the kiss,\ndesperate to push you back down on his cock but his hands squeezed your tightly\nas you suffocated his helpless needy whimpers with your tongue.</p><p>Your thighs were giving in,\nbut you didn\u2019t want to give in now\u2026 not when you were feeling the sweet feeling\nleading up to your climax.</p><p>Out of breath you pulled\naway from the kiss and Taehyung noticed your building exhaustion. He used his strength\nand pushed your hands back, making you lose your grip of his hands and he\nquickly wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled you down against his\nchest, making him slip out and he rolled over, now on top of you.</p><p>He kissed your lips and\nthrusted back in hard and deep, making you moan loud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take over now baby.\u201d\nHe whispered.</p><p>He went hard.</p><p>Full force.</p><p>Thrusting deep, hard and\nfast.</p><p>Immediately sending you\nclose to the edge.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d He\nasked in a cocky tone.</p><p>\u201cMhmm\u201d You hummed, holding\nonto him tight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, you\nknow that huh?\u201d He panted, repeatedly praising you.</p><p>He moaned loudly.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>He leaned in by your ear,\nmaking you able to hear his heavy breathing even more.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re so good at\ntaking my cock.\u201d He chuckled, devilishly.</p><p>He hummed in pleasure\nagainst your ear and you grabbed on even tighter, fingers desperately searching\nfor grip on his shoulder blades when you felt your muscles tense up.</p><p>He thrusted harder, earning\na moan on the border to a scream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close.\u201d He whispered\nand pounded harder into you again.</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t stop!\u201d You begged.</p><p>He went faster, sweat\nforming on his skin, chest almost heaving and long low whimpers escaping his\nthroat while he chased both your highs.</p><p>\u201cT-Taehyung\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby?\u201d</p><p>In the heat of the moment\nhe licked up the side of your neck.</p><p>You dug your fingertips\ndeeper into his toned back muscles.</p><p>Another fast hard thrust\nand your muscles claimed all control from you.

Book a flight to Oslo and take in\nat a hotel for the night and freshen up and sleep. That was his new plan.</p><p>He walked\npast a tiny caf\u00e9 on his way out and glanced over it when he suddenly froze,\nheart stopping.</p><p>There was a\nglass wall in front of the caf\u00e9, the only way in was via the passport control\u2026</p><p>You were\nthere.</p><p>Sitting at\none of the tables with an empty plate in front of you and your phone in your\nhands\u2026 crying.</p><p>You wiped\nthe back of your hand across your cheek and put your phone down.</p><p>He quickly\nescaped out of your sight, holding his fist pressed against his mouth,\ndesperate to stop the tears that were welling up.</p><p>Why were\nyou crying?</p><p>Was it his\nfault?</p><p>You were\nthere all the time\u2026</p><p>He wanted\nto run to you, run and comfort you, hold you close and kiss every tear away\u2026\nbut he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>You thought\nhe was in Korea.</p><p>He had lied\nto you.</p><p>He looked back\nat you, wishing you\u2019d accidently see him\u2026 force him to explain\u2026 but his legs\nmanaged to carry him the way to the exit.</p><p>Taehyung\nwalked with a heavy heart out of the airport, passing by the ticket offices and\nneglecting them. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just\nbook it on my phone\u2026\u201d He thought.</p><p>All he\nwanted was to shower and lie down now.</p><p>He searched\nup the nearest hotel on his phone and luckily there was an airport hotel right\nnearby.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nhave any rooms available for one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do!\nWould you like a single or double room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle\nplease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\n1600 koruna for one night. Can I borrow your passport and credit card please?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\nhanded the receptionist what he asked for.</p><p>A short\nwhile later he was handed them back together with a room key.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast\nis included and is served in the room behind you between 6am and 10am.\u201d The\nreceptionist smiled and gestured towards the dining room.</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Why\nwouldn\u2019t he pick up!? Did his phone die?</p><p>A second\nmore and you would\u2019ve started considering going back home until he hinted on\nvisiting you.</p><p>You wanted\nto call him back again and convince him to come visit you! You wanted him here\nwith you and for once it felt like he really was there and then suddenly he\nwasn\u2019t.</p><p>You gave\nup.</p><p>Your\nfeelings weren\u2019t going to go away, not like this.</p><p>A tear\nescaped your eye and ran down your cheek.</p><p>You cursed\nsilently.</p><p>Why did\nyour heart have to love him of all people\u2026?</p><p>A dumb\nquestion.</p><p>But this\nwas breaking your heart and you needed to board your flight soon.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The bed\nfelt soft against his bare back.</p><p>Taehyung\nlied down on the bed with a towel wrapped around his hips after his long\nshower.</p><p>He reached\nfor his phone and began to click through to the booking site.</p><p>The shower\nhelped him calm down and collect his thoughts. </p><p>All he\nneeded now was a good night\u2019s sleep and everything would be ok. He convinced\nhimself.</p><p>One night\nmeant you\u2019d be on your way to Norway tomorrow\u2026</p><p>-No flights\navailable, please check other dates-</p><p>The day\nafter tomorrow\u2026</p><p>There was\none flight, late.</p><p>He quickly\nbooked it.</p><p>Two nights\nin Prague\u2026 and getting up there another way would be a hassle. He didn\u2019t know\nwhat trains to take and driving was the last thing he would want to do alone in\na foreign country.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The\nmeetings in Kiev were long and you were hungry.</p><p>The bosses\nof the company did their very best to impress you and it all sounded good but\non an empty stomach it was hard for you to concentrate.</p><p>You knew\nthat if you mentioned lunch, lunch would be served. The places you had visited\nso far showed a concerning amount of respect towards you, almost as if they\nwere intimidated by you\u2026 which they should be, but you\u2019re a human too. Sure you\nrepresented a large company that had the upper hand of all of them, a bad\nimpression on you could cause them so much trouble but so far you hadn\u2019t\nstumbled upon anything besides the incident in Italy that was of concern.</p><p>The host of\nthe meeting announced a five minute break and you took your chance. You\napproached the older man and asked him when lunch would be served and suddenly\nthe schedule was shifted.</p><p>The other\nparticipants looked confused for a moment when he suddenly announced that he\nmeant lunch instead, not a five minute coffee break.</p><p>On your way\nto the cafeteria in the building you fished your phone out of your pocket and\nhad a quick glance.</p><p>No missed\ncalls.</p><p>Your heart\nsunk in your chest.</p><p>But now\nwasn\u2019t the time to concern yourself about him, you were here for work.</p><p>You\nshrugged the thoughts of Taehyung off.</p><p>Forget him.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung\nwalked around the city, admiring the old buildings and taking a few photos.</p><p>He brought\nhis camera along\u2026 just in case. He was happy and thankful for his decision.</p><p>While in\nthe center of town he also stopped by a few shops to by himself some more and\nwarmer clothes. Strolling through the streets he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what\nit would be like to be here with you\u2026 You could go sightseeing together, hold\nhands, do some fun shopping and go to nice restaurants, take cute couple photos\nby the river\u2026 look at the old castle\u2026</p><p>He felt\nlonely.</p><p>Should he\ncall you?</p><p>He decided\nno and instead called Jimin while walking back towards the bus stop to get back\nto the airport hotel.</p><p>Jimin\ndidn\u2019t pick up.</p><p>Not a\nsurprise considering that it was in the middle of the night over there.</p><p>If he\ncalled you, you\u2019d know that it was in the middle of the night\u2026</p><p>He got on\nthe bus and put his headphones instead to listen to some music. He scrolled\nthrough Instagram during the bus ride and came across your photos from Estonia\nand now Kiev.</p><p>He liked\nthem and realized a second later that you\u2019d see that he had.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\nnever mind.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Your head\nhit the pillow hard after the long day.</p><p>Despite\nbeing tired you had agreed on following them out for a late night outing only\nto then leave it early and excuse yourself with that your flight was early the\nnext day, when it in fact was mid-day.</p><p>Your feet\nwere aching and resting on the bed was such a relief.</p><p>You felt\nstressed and exhausted, but your feed made it look like you were having the\nbest of times seeing all these places.</p><p>Your phone\nlit up every now and then from the few like of your photos of Kiev and to your\nsurprise you saw Taehyung\u2019s name among them.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t\nhe be sleeping?\u201d</p><p>You quickly\nsent him a text.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nawake?\u201d</p><p>After a\nlonger while he finally responded.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nsleep :(\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsleeping troubles are worrying me. Do you drink tea before bed? It might help\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try\nit. Don\u2019t worry about me though.\u201d</p><p>Whenever he\ntold you not to worry while you were worrying, it made you feel frustrated.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung I\nwill worry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok~\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop\ntexting me and go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cno\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cno\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to reply anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll\ncry myself to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop haha\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you\na lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you\ntoo, but you still need to sleep. We can face time tomorrow when you wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is your\nflight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u2026\nwe can face time when I\u2019ve landed maybe? My flight is during the morning for\nyou.\u201d</p><p>It took him\nlonger to reply this time.</p><p>\u201cok\u201d</p><p>You wanted\nto send him something affectionate\u2026 but you couldn\u2019t get yourself to do it with\nease.</p><p>Perhaps a heart?\nA heart could be platonic\u2026</p><p>\u201c\u2764\u201d</p><p>\u201d\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u201d</p><p>So much\nfor trying to get over him\u2026</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Would you figure out his\ncryptic message? Was it obvious that the hearts were meant to stand for \u201cI love\nu\u201d? </p><p>It was getting harder and\nharder for him to contain himself.</p><p>All he wanted was for his\nflight to Norway to come sooner\u2026 so he could hold you.</p><p>He was letting himself go\neven more, more than he already had. Maybe call it accidental flirting but deep\ndown it was intentional.</p><p>\u201cI miss you so much.\u201d He\nsent, trying to come across as pleading.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you wave\nme off?\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Maybe anger would do? Yes,\nanger.</p><p>If you boiled up anger\ntowards him maybe it would be easier to let him go\u2026 but to what use? Did you\nwant to return home to him not being your friend anymore? </p><p>You instantly regretted\nsending that.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought I\nwouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d He typed out, being honest but then deleting\nthe later and only sending that he was sorry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I understand if\nyou were busy.\u201d</p><p>That reply made him feel\neven worse.</p><p>\u201cPlease wait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait for me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>He placed his phone on the\nnightstand and it dinged when you responded but he didn\u2019t bother to look,\nassuming it was just a good night which back despite it being evening.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Your plane touched down in\nOslo on time and you were picked up by a pre-booked taxi to take you to your\nhotel near the business district.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung anxiously tried to\nwaste his time before his flight.</p><p>He locked his tiny suitcase\nin a locker at the airport and headed into town one last time.</p><p>Should he buy you a gift?</p><p>He walked past a few\njewelry shops and the idea intrigued him more and more.</p><p>What if you wouldn\u2019t like\nit?</p><p>Maybe you didn\u2019t want him\nto visit?</p><p>But you said you missed\nhim\u2026</p><p>He stopped in front of the\nwindow of a shop and his eyes caught the attention of one of the rings\ndisplayed on a piece of red velvet fabric.</p><p>A ring?</p><p>Maybe it looked too much\nlike an engagement ring\u2026</p><p>A thought suddenly struck\nhim but he quickly shrugged it off and continued walking.</p><p>He walked into a clothing\nstore instead and looked at the scarves and gloves\u2026 were you cold?</p><p>Did you have plenty of warm\nclothes with you?</p><p>You could borrow his scarf\nif you were cold\u2026 like you did once.</p><p>He suddenly found himself\nsurrounded with baby clothes, haven accidently walked into the kids section,\ndistracted with thoughts.</p><p>A tiny pair of gloves\ncaught his attention and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from feeling the soft fabric.</p><p>/Why am I so dumb\u2026?/</p><p>He sighed and left the\nstore.</p><p>Maybe he should just get to\nthe airport early and wait there instead\u2026</p><p>It felt like the whole town\nwas suddenly crowded with couples and families, all happy people in love\nsurrounding him\u2026</p><p>His heart was aching and he\nquickly fled towards the bus stop to head to the airport.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The business you were\nvisiting had surprisingly prepared a boat ride in the fjord for all the\nparticipants, something that had you very excited. The boat would take you to a\nconference center where you\u2019d have a few meetings. Before that you had already\nbeen shown around the facility and gotten answers on all of your questions. The\nday would end with a big dinner later that evening.</p><p>The rain was hanging in the\nclouds but it had yet to fall over the city when you all climbed onboard the\nboat.</p><p>You eagerly took pictures\nof the beautiful scenery and quickly sent one to Taehyung. </p><p>You chatted with one of the\nparticipants and he eagerly told you about their food culture and the history\nof fishing.</p><p>It was a beautiful city, a\nlot smaller to the size than you had expected, but still stunning nonetheless.\nIt had certain serenity and calm that wasn\u2019t common for capitals.</p><p>You wanted to return.</p><p>Luckily you had your few\nfree days to spend here before you headed to France.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>As the plane approached\nthere was a stunning view of city lights. </p><p>The lights became fewer and\nfewer the lower the plane flew and the occasional light appeared again when it\nflew over a highway. A mere moment later the colorful lights of the runway were\nin sight and the plane touched down with a gentle thud.</p><p>He hurried off the plane,\ngot a stamp in his passport by the border and grabbed the first taxi to take\nhim into the city.</p><p>There was no time to waste.</p><p>He walked into the first\nhotel he could find and paid for three nights.</p><p>The hotel was large and\nlavish looking and not too far away was the royal palace.</p><p>Taehyung dropped his bag\noff in his room quickly and then ran out into the night.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The dinner had come to an\nend and you were all saying your goodbyes. According to your phone your hotel\nwas a short walk from where you had been eating so you decided to enjoy the\ncool midnight air with a walk back.</p><p>The streets were empty and\nlit up by shop windows and street lights.</p><p>A cold wind from the fjord\nwhistled through the city, making you shiver and pull your coat tighter around\nyou.</p><p>Your phone suddenly rang.</p><p>You heart skipped a beat\nwhen you read Taehyung\u2019s name on the screen. You had forgotten that you were\ngoing to face time when you landed! You groaned in annoyance at yourself and\nquickly picked up.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhere are you!?\u201d He\nscreamed, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I\u2019m in Oslo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere!?\u201d</p><p>You looked around.</p><p>\u201cNear the train station\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung what\u2019s the\nmatter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay there!\u201d He cried\nout.</p><p>Your heartbeat increased\nand you began to feel unsafe.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung this isn\u2019t\nfunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the train station!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, ok\u2026 I\u2019m going, but\nwhy?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, all you\ncould hear was his uneasy breathing, making it sound like he was running.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>He could see the train\nstation, but not you.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d He asked\nagain.</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t know, it says\noe\u2026\u00f8stbanehallen on the building.\u201d You said, struggling to pronounce it. \u201cIt\u2019s\nwhite and there\u2019s a statue in front of it. Why are you asking?\u201d</p><p>He started running again,\naround the corner of the large building, desperate to find you.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cTaehyung? Hello?\u201d You\nrepeated, you were getting cold and you wanted to go back, what was he doing?</p><p>The phone call cut off.</p><p>You looked at your phone\nwith a confused expression and put it back in your pocket as you began to walk\nagain.</p><p>But you were stopped by the\ncall of your name.</p><p>You turned around at the\nsound of the familiar voice, in disbelief.</p><p> \u201cTaehyung?!\u201d</p><p>He was running towards you,\nhis phone dead in his hand, breathing heavily and tears streaming down his\nface.</p><p>His strong arms wrapped\naround your waist and pulled you close and cried out against your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cF- finally\u2026\u201d He panted.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nYou asked, hugging him back. </p><p>Holding back the tears of relief\nfrom seeing him, feeling his arms around you and his sudden presence was\ndifficult. One tear managed to escape your eye at first and you sniffled\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cSomething I should\u2019ve done\nlong ago!\u201d He cried.</p><p>His cold hands suddenly\ngrabbed the sides of your face and before you could react his lips crashed\nagainst yours.</p><p>There was no turning back\nnow.</p><p>The bottle overflowing with\nfeeling for him had been kicked over and smashed.</p><p>You held your arms around\nhim tighter and pressed back against the kiss, tears falling freely.</p><p>He pulled back, your lips\nmaking a low smack sound and his hands still on the sides of your face when he\nlooked you deeply in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d You\nalmost whispered, drowned out by your tears.</p><p>He kissed you again and one\nof his hands fell to your side.</p><p>His kiss was passionate and\nfilled with desire\u2026 making out with you, releasing all suppressed feelings.</p><p>\u201cDid you come all this way\nto tell me that?\u201d You sniffed, when he pulled away again.</p><p>\u201cand that I\u2019m sorry for not\nwaving you off, I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you showed up I\nwould\u2019ve stayed.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and stroked his\nthumb across your cheekbone to wipe your tears away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was better that I\nshowed up here instead.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and leaned in to\nkiss him more.</p><p>You pressed your forehead\nagainst his.</p><p>\u201cYou must be so tired\u2026\u201d You\nsniffled.</p><p>\u201cI rested when I was in\nPrague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in Prague?\u201d</p><p>\u201cand Amsterdam to go to\nEstonia and then cancelled my flight and rebooked on the spot to Prague\ninstead.\u201d He giggled. \u201cI chased you all this way\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\u2026\u201d You looked up\ninto his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d You giggled through the tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy for you.\u201d He\nkissed your forehead.</p><p>\u201cI almost had you in Prague\nbut I arrived at the wrong terminal and they wouldn\u2019t let me through\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 we facetimed\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hid in the bathroom so\nyou wouldn\u2019t see where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy- Why didn\u2019t you just\ntell me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you in\nperson.\u201d</p><p>You hid your face against\nhis chest.</p><p>His hand patted your head\nsoothingly and you stayed like that for a while.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d\nYou asked, looking back up at him.</p><p>\u201cThe grand, I think it was\ncalled.

He crawled up on top of you on the bed and slipped\nhis tongue between your plump lips.</p><p>You wanted him.</p><p>He wanted you.</p><p>His hands moved up your\nsides, caressing your skin from your hip to your waist and up along the sides\nof your chest until he reached your breasts. He cupped each in one hand and\nsqueezed gently, making you let out a soft low moan against the kiss, arousal\ngrowing even stronger.</p><p>Your hands played with his\nlong soft hair, turning the neat curled style into a fluffed up mess while he\nexplored every surface of your breasts, fondling, squeezing, feeling\u2026 </p><p>His thumb and index pinched\nlightly at your left nipple, awakening your arousal even more and stronger and\nyou felt yourself getting wet under his touch.</p><p>He pulled away from the\nkiss and latched on to your right nipple, sucking on it roughly and pulling\ngently with his lips to make it even harder for him.</p><p>His other hand replaced his\nlips, pinching and twisting ever so gently while he hid his face in the crook\nbetween your neck and shoulder, placing soft kisses against your skin.</p><p>The touch of his soft wet\nlips tickled slightly and made you squirm.</p><p>He chuckled lightly at your\nreaction and playfully nibbled your skin, but enough to make it develop into a\nsmall bruised mark.</p><p>He moved up to your ear\nlobe instead and nibbled at it gently and let his hands fall to the sides of\nyou instead to support his body.</p><p>You pushed him over, rolling\non top of him, seated over his hips.</p><p>He looked up at you with\nwide eyes and a surprised expression.</p><p>You walked your hands up\nhis bare chest and leaned down by his ear, teasingly repeating his own move and\nsucking softly at his ear lobe, tugging at it gently with your lips. </p><p>A giggle tickled his ear.</p><p>You had your left hand\nagainst the side of his thick neck, caressing it passionately and feeling his\nsmooth skin.</p><p>He seemed to like it,\nlooking up at you with dark eyes and a wide smirk.</p><p>His hands travelled up your\nthighs while your lips trailed kisses down his neck to his collarbone.</p><p>You gently squeezed your\nleft hand around his neck, earning a low moan.</p><p>You sat up straight, hands\npressed against his chest. When you lowered yourself to sit on him you felt his\nhard bulge poke you through his black jeans. You climbed off him instead and he\nwas quick to tackle you and get back on top.</p><p>You reached for his belt\nbuckle and pulled at it a few times before unbuckling his belt. Taehyung placed\na kiss on your lips and sat up on his knees over you and unzipped his jeans,\npulling them down his thighs, exposing his hard cock straining against the\nfabric of his boxers.</p><p>He got off you and quickly\ntook his jeans off, kicking them off the bed, leaving you in an equal amount of\nclothing. Getting back on top his lips immediately found yours and he kissed\nyou passionately, lips sucking on lips, tongue swirling around tongue, quickly\nbecoming a mess.</p><p>He pulled away, not far.\nHis nose brushed against yours and his hand cupped the side of your face. His\nthumb caressed your lower lip, dragging across it slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d He\nwhispered.</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful\u2026\u201d He pressed\nhis forehead against yours.</p><p>Your fingers found the hem\nof his boxers and pulled them down slowly as far as you could before he stood\nup straight on his knees again, touch abandoning you.</p><p>He hooked his finger under\nthe side of your panties and began to slip them down your legs as far as\npossible before he got off of you and yanked them off completely.</p><p>His hands reached for\nhimself, sliding his boxers down his hips, exposing himself.</p><p>He grabbed his thick cock\nwith one hand after successfully getting rid of the last remaining piece of\nclothing keeping you apart.</p><p>The tip was slightly pink,\nbegging for touch, achingly hard and aroused.</p><p>A few subtle veins trailed\nup his length from the very base of his cock.</p><p>He looked good\u2026</p><p>Aren\u2019t people the most\nattractive when they\u2019re aroused and horny?</p><p>His hand slowly stroked\nhimself and he swallowed, looking down at you.</p><p>You sat up, grabbed his\nshoulder and pushed him back down on the bed, straddling him.</p><p>His hand immediately left\nhis cock, making it fall against his lower abdomen as both his hands grabbed\nyour waist.</p><p>You positioned yourself and\nbegan to grind gently against his cock, making him bite his lip. Sliding up and\ndown his lengths, coating him with your arousal that was just making you more\nand more wet, aching for relief.</p><p>You had your hands pressed\nagainst his chest, one of Taehyung\u2019s hands left your waist to caress your wrist\ninstead. You stopped your movements and leaned down to kiss him.</p><p>A final kiss before you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to contain yourself anymore\u2026</p><p>You pulled away, leaving\nhim needy for your lips to return. You reached down and wrapped your hand\ngently around his cock, dragging the tip up and down your slit a few times before\nyou lowered yourself, positioning the tip by your entrance and sliding down his\nthick length halfway.</p><p>Your hand returned to his\nchest and he thrusted upwards, desperate to slip in further, for you to take\nhis full length. Your nails scratched his skin softly and you let him slide in\nall the way, stretching you out. He felt so good\u2026</p><p>You pushed yourself up and\nlowered yourself back down again, picking up a slow pace. He exhaled deeply\nunder you as you began to ride him faster, sliding up and down half his length before\nyou pushed down all the way, making both of you let out a whimpering moan. You\npicked up your speed fast, sliding up and down his thick cock from right\nbeneath his head to the very base. </p><p>His big hands grabbed your\nhips, guiding you and making it even harder to contain the sounds of pleasure needing\nto escape your throat.</p><p>You leaned your head back,\nsmiling widely as pleasure took over all your senses. You felt sexy riding him\nlike this\u2026</p><p>You grabbed his hand from\nyour hip and locked your fingers with his, pressing his hand back against the\nbed, doing the same with the other and leaning down to kiss him.</p><p>He moaned against the kiss,\ndesperate to push you back down on his cock but his hands squeezed your tightly\nas you suffocated his helpless needy whimpers with your tongue.</p><p>Your thighs were giving in,\nbut you didn\u2019t want to give in now\u2026 not when you were feeling the sweet feeling\nleading up to your climax.</p><p>Out of breath you pulled\naway from the kiss and Taehyung noticed your building exhaustion. He used his strength\nand pushed your hands back, making you lose your grip of his hands and he\nquickly wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled you down against his\nchest, making him slip out and he rolled over, now on top of you.</p><p>He kissed your lips and\nthrusted back in hard and deep, making you moan loud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take over now baby.\u201d\nHe whispered.</p><p>He went hard.</p><p>Full force.</p><p>Thrusting deep, hard and\nfast.</p><p>Immediately sending you\nclose to the edge.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d He\nasked in a cocky tone.</p><p>\u201cMhmm\u201d You hummed, holding\nonto him tight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, you\nknow that huh?\u201d He panted, repeatedly praising you.</p><p>He moaned loudly.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>He leaned in by your ear,\nmaking you able to hear his heavy breathing even more.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re so good at\ntaking my cock.\u201d He chuckled, devilishly.</p><p>He hummed in pleasure\nagainst your ear and you grabbed on even tighter, fingers desperately searching\nfor grip on his shoulder blades when you felt your muscles tense up.</p><p>He thrusted harder, earning\na moan on the border to a scream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close.\u201d He whispered\nand pounded harder into you again.</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t stop!\u201d You begged.</p><p>He went faster, sweat\nforming on his skin, chest almost heaving and long low whimpers escaping his\nthroat while he chased both your highs.</p><p>\u201cT-Taehyung\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby?\u201d</p><p>In the heat of the moment\nhe licked up the side of your neck.</p><p>You dug your fingertips\ndeeper into his toned back muscles.</p><p>Another fast hard thrust\nand your muscles claimed all control from you.

That was his new plan.</p><p>He walked\npast a tiny caf\u00e9 on his way out and glanced over it when he suddenly froze,\nheart stopping.</p><p>There was a\nglass wall in front of the caf\u00e9, the only way in was via the passport control\u2026</p><p>You were\nthere.</p><p>Sitting at\none of the tables with an empty plate in front of you and your phone in your\nhands\u2026 crying.</p><p>You wiped\nthe back of your hand across your cheek and put your phone down.</p><p>He quickly\nescaped out of your sight, holding his fist pressed against his mouth,\ndesperate to stop the tears that were welling up.</p><p>Why were\nyou crying?</p><p>Was it his\nfault?</p><p>You were\nthere all the time\u2026</p><p>He wanted\nto run to you, run and comfort you, hold you close and kiss every tear away\u2026\nbut he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>You thought\nhe was in Korea.</p><p>He had lied\nto you.</p><p>He looked back\nat you, wishing you\u2019d accidently see him\u2026 force him to explain\u2026 but his legs\nmanaged to carry him the way to the exit.</p><p>Taehyung\nwalked with a heavy heart out of the airport, passing by the ticket offices and\nneglecting them. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just\nbook it on my phone\u2026\u201d He thought.</p><p>All he\nwanted was to shower and lie down now.</p><p>He searched\nup the nearest hotel on his phone and luckily there was an airport hotel right\nnearby.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nhave any rooms available for one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do!\nWould you like a single or double room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle\nplease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\n1600 koruna for one night.

He didn\u2019t know\nwhat trains to take and driving was the last thing he would want to do alone in\na foreign country.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The\nmeetings in Kiev were long and you were hungry.</p><p>The bosses\nof the company did their very best to impress you and it all sounded good but\non an empty stomach it was hard for you to concentrate.</p><p>You knew\nthat if you mentioned lunch, lunch would be served. The places you had visited\nso far showed a concerning amount of respect towards you, almost as if they\nwere intimidated by you\u2026 which they should be, but you\u2019re a human too. Sure you\nrepresented a large company that had the upper hand of all of them, a bad\nimpression on you could cause them so much trouble but so far you hadn\u2019t\nstumbled upon anything besides the incident in Italy that was of concern.</p><p>The host of\nthe meeting announced a five minute break and you took your chance. You\napproached the older man and asked him when lunch would be served and suddenly\nthe schedule was shifted.</p><p>The other\nparticipants looked confused for a moment when he suddenly announced that he\nmeant lunch instead, not a five minute coffee break.</p><p>On your way\nto the cafeteria in the building you fished your phone out of your pocket and\nhad a quick glance.</p><p>No missed\ncalls.</p><p>Your heart\nsunk in your chest.</p><p>But now\nwasn\u2019t the time to concern yourself about him, you were here for work.</p><p>You\nshrugged the thoughts of Taehyung off.</p><p>Forget him.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung\nwalked around the city, admiring the old buildings and taking a few photos.</p><p>He brought\nhis camera along\u2026 just in case. He was happy and thankful for his decision.</p><p>While in\nthe center of town he also stopped by a few shops to by himself some more and\nwarmer clothes. Strolling through the streets he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what\nit would be like to be here with you\u2026 You could go sightseeing together, hold\nhands, do some fun shopping and go to nice restaurants, take cute couple photos\nby the river\u2026 look at the old castle\u2026</p><p>He felt\nlonely.</p><p>Should he\ncall you?</p><p>He decided\nno and instead called Jimin while walking back towards the bus stop to get back\nto the airport hotel.</p><p>Jimin\ndidn\u2019t pick up.</p><p>Not a\nsurprise considering that it was in the middle of the night over there.</p><p>If he\ncalled you, you\u2019d know that it was in the middle of the night\u2026</p><p>He got on\nthe bus and put his headphones instead to listen to some music. He scrolled\nthrough Instagram during the bus ride and came across your photos from Estonia\nand now Kiev.</p><p>He liked\nthem and realized a second later that you\u2019d see that he had.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\nnever mind.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Your head\nhit the pillow hard after the long day.</p><p>Despite\nbeing tired you had agreed on following them out for a late night outing only\nto then leave it early and excuse yourself with that your flight was early the\nnext day, when it in fact was mid-day.</p><p>Your feet\nwere aching and resting on the bed was such a relief.</p><p>You felt\nstressed and exhausted, but your feed made it look like you were having the\nbest of times seeing all these places.</p><p>Your phone\nlit up every now and then from the few like of your photos of Kiev and to your\nsurprise you saw Taehyung\u2019s name among them.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t\nhe be sleeping?\u201d</p><p>You quickly\nsent him a text.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nawake?\u201d</p><p>After a\nlonger while he finally responded.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nsleep :(\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsleeping troubles are worrying me.

Don\u2019t worry about me though.\u201d</p><p>Whenever he\ntold you not to worry while you were worrying, it made you feel frustrated.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung I\nwill worry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok~\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop\ntexting me and go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cno\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cno\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to reply anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll\ncry myself to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop haha\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you\na lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you\ntoo, but you still need to sleep. We can face time tomorrow when you wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is your\nflight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u2026\nwe can face time when I\u2019ve landed maybe? My flight is during the morning for\nyou.\u201d</p><p>It took him\nlonger to reply this time.</p><p>\u201cok\u201d</p><p>You wanted\nto send him something affectionate\u2026 but you couldn\u2019t get yourself to do it with\nease.</p><p>Perhaps a heart?\nA heart could be platonic\u2026</p><p>\u201c\u2764\u201d</p><p>\u201d\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u201d</p><p>So much\nfor trying to get over him\u2026</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Would you figure out his\ncryptic message? Was it obvious that the hearts were meant to stand for \u201cI love\nu\u201d? </p><p>It was getting harder and\nharder for him to contain himself.</p><p>All he wanted was for his\nflight to Norway to come sooner\u2026 so he could hold you.</p><p>He was letting himself go\neven more, more than he already had. Maybe call it accidental flirting but deep\ndown it was intentional.</p><p>\u201cI miss you so much.\u201d He\nsent, trying to come across as pleading.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you wave\nme off?\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Maybe anger would do? Yes,\nanger.</p><p>If you boiled up anger\ntowards him maybe it would be easier to let him go\u2026 but to what use? Did you\nwant to return home to him not being your friend anymore? </p><p>You instantly regretted\nsending that.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought I\nwouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d He typed out, being honest but then deleting\nthe later and only sending that he was sorry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I understand if\nyou were busy.\u201d</p><p>That reply made him feel\neven worse.</p><p>\u201cPlease wait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait for me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>He placed his phone on the\nnightstand and it dinged when you responded but he didn\u2019t bother to look,\nassuming it was just a good night which back despite it being evening.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Your plane touched down in\nOslo on time and you were picked up by a pre-booked taxi to take you to your\nhotel near the business district.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung anxiously tried to\nwaste his time before his flight.</p><p>He locked his tiny suitcase\nin a locker at the airport and headed into town one last time.</p><p>Should he buy you a gift?</p><p>He walked past a few\njewelry shops and the idea intrigued him more and more.</p><p>What if you wouldn\u2019t like\nit?</p><p>Maybe you didn\u2019t want him\nto visit?</p><p>But you said you missed\nhim\u2026</p><p>He stopped in front of the\nwindow of a shop and his eyes caught the attention of one of the rings\ndisplayed on a piece of red velvet fabric.</p><p>A ring?</p><p>Maybe it looked too much\nlike an engagement ring\u2026</p><p>A thought suddenly struck\nhim but he quickly shrugged it off and continued walking.</p><p>He walked into a clothing\nstore instead and looked at the scarves and gloves\u2026 were you cold?</p><p>Did you have plenty of warm\nclothes with you?</p><p>You could borrow his scarf\nif you were cold\u2026 like you did once.</p><p>He suddenly found himself\nsurrounded with baby clothes, haven accidently walked into the kids section,\ndistracted with thoughts.</p><p>A tiny pair of gloves\ncaught his attention and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from feeling the soft fabric.</p><p>/Why am I so dumb\u2026?/</p><p>He sighed and left the\nstore.</p><p>Maybe he should just get to\nthe airport early and wait there instead\u2026</p><p>It felt like the whole town\nwas suddenly crowded with couples and families, all happy people in love\nsurrounding him\u2026</p><p>His heart was aching and he\nquickly fled towards the bus stop to head to the airport.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The business you were\nvisiting had surprisingly prepared a boat ride in the fjord for all the\nparticipants, something that had you very excited. The boat would take you to a\nconference center where you\u2019d have a few meetings. Before that you had already\nbeen shown around the facility and gotten answers on all of your questions. The\nday would end with a big dinner later that evening.</p><p>The rain was hanging in the\nclouds but it had yet to fall over the city when you all climbed onboard the\nboat.</p><p>You eagerly took pictures\nof the beautiful scenery and quickly sent one to Taehyung. </p><p>You chatted with one of the\nparticipants and he eagerly told you about their food culture and the history\nof fishing.</p><p>It was a beautiful city, a\nlot smaller to the size than you had expected, but still stunning nonetheless.\nIt had certain serenity and calm that wasn\u2019t common for capitals.</p><p>You wanted to return.</p><p>Luckily you had your few\nfree days to spend here before you headed to France.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>As the plane approached\nthere was a stunning view of city lights. </p><p>The lights became fewer and\nfewer the lower the plane flew and the occasional light appeared again when it\nflew over a highway. A mere moment later the colorful lights of the runway were\nin sight and the plane touched down with a gentle thud.</p><p>He hurried off the plane,\ngot a stamp in his passport by the border and grabbed the first taxi to take\nhim into the city.</p><p>There was no time to waste.</p><p>He walked into the first\nhotel he could find and paid for three nights.</p><p>The hotel was large and\nlavish looking and not too far away was the royal palace.</p><p>Taehyung dropped his bag\noff in his room quickly and then ran out into the night.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The dinner had come to an\nend and you were all saying your goodbyes. According to your phone your hotel\nwas a short walk from where you had been eating so you decided to enjoy the\ncool midnight air with a walk back.</p><p>The streets were empty and\nlit up by shop windows and street lights.</p><p>A cold wind from the fjord\nwhistled through the city, making you shiver and pull your coat tighter around\nyou.</p><p>Your phone suddenly rang.</p><p>You heart skipped a beat\nwhen you read Taehyung\u2019s name on the screen. You had forgotten that you were\ngoing to face time when you landed! You groaned in annoyance at yourself and\nquickly picked up.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhere are you!?\u201d He\nscreamed, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I\u2019m in Oslo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere!?\u201d</p><p>You looked around.</p><p>\u201cNear the train station\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung what\u2019s the\nmatter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay there!\u201d He cried\nout.</p><p>Your heartbeat increased\nand you began to feel unsafe.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung this isn\u2019t\nfunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the train station!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, ok\u2026 I\u2019m going, but\nwhy?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, all you\ncould hear was his uneasy breathing, making it sound like he was running.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>He could see the train\nstation, but not you.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d He asked\nagain.</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t know, it says\noe\u2026\u00f8stbanehallen on the building.\u201d You said, struggling to pronounce it. \u201cIt\u2019s\nwhite and there\u2019s a statue in front of it.

When you lowered yourself to sit on him you felt his\nhard bulge poke you through his black jeans. You climbed off him instead and he\nwas quick to tackle you and get back on top.</p><p>You reached for his belt\nbuckle and pulled at it a few times before unbuckling his belt. Taehyung placed\na kiss on your lips and sat up on his knees over you and unzipped his jeans,\npulling them down his thighs, exposing his hard cock straining against the\nfabric of his boxers.</p><p>He got off you and quickly\ntook his jeans off, kicking them off the bed, leaving you in an equal amount of\nclothing.

His\nthumb caressed your lower lip, dragging across it slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d He\nwhispered.</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful\u2026\u201d He pressed\nhis forehead against yours.</p><p>Your fingers found the hem\nof his boxers and pulled them down slowly as far as you could before he stood\nup straight on his knees again, touch abandoning you.</p><p>He hooked his finger under\nthe side of your panties and began to slip them down your legs as far as\npossible before he got off of you and yanked them off completely.</p><p>His hands reached for\nhimself, sliding his boxers down his hips, exposing himself.</p><p>He grabbed his thick cock\nwith one hand after successfully getting rid of the last remaining piece of\nclothing keeping you apart.</p><p>The tip was slightly pink,\nbegging for touch, achingly hard and aroused.</p><p>A few subtle veins trailed\nup his length from the very base of his cock.</p><p>He looked good\u2026</p><p>Aren\u2019t people the most\nattractive when they\u2019re aroused and horny?</p><p>His hand slowly stroked\nhimself and he swallowed, looking down at you.</p><p>You sat up, grabbed his\nshoulder and pushed him back down on the bed, straddling him.</p><p>His hand immediately left\nhis cock, making it fall against his lower abdomen as both his hands grabbed\nyour waist.</p><p>You positioned yourself and\nbegan to grind gently against his cock, making him bite his lip. Sliding up and\ndown his lengths, coating him with your arousal that was just making you more\nand more wet, aching for relief.</p><p>You had your hands pressed\nagainst his chest, one of Taehyung\u2019s hands left your waist to caress your wrist\ninstead. You stopped your movements and leaned down to kiss him.</p><p>A final kiss before you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to contain yourself anymore\u2026</p><p>You pulled away, leaving\nhim needy for your lips to return. You reached down and wrapped your hand\ngently around his cock, dragging the tip up and down your slit a few times before\nyou lowered yourself, positioning the tip by your entrance and sliding down his\nthick length halfway.</p><p>Your hand returned to his\nchest and he thrusted upwards, desperate to slip in further, for you to take\nhis full length. Your nails scratched his skin softly and you let him slide in\nall the way, stretching you out. He felt so good\u2026</p><p>You pushed yourself up and\nlowered yourself back down again, picking up a slow pace. He exhaled deeply\nunder you as you began to ride him faster, sliding up and down half his length before\nyou pushed down all the way, making both of you let out a whimpering moan. You\npicked up your speed fast, sliding up and down his thick cock from right\nbeneath his head to the very base. </p><p>His big hands grabbed your\nhips, guiding you and making it even harder to contain the sounds of pleasure needing\nto escape your throat.</p><p>You leaned your head back,\nsmiling widely as pleasure took over all your senses.

Book a flight to Oslo and take in\nat a hotel for the night and freshen up and sleep. That was his new plan.</p><p>He walked\npast a tiny caf&eacute; on his way out and glanced over it when he suddenly froze,\nheart stopping.</p><p>There was a\nglass wall in front of the caf&eacute;, the only way in was via the passport control&hellip;</p><p>You were\nthere.</p><p>Sitting at\none of the tables with an empty plate in front of you and your phone in your\nhands&hellip; crying.</p><p>You wiped\nthe back of your hand across your cheek and put your phone down.</p><p>He quickly\nescaped out of your sight, holding his fist pressed against his mouth,\ndesperate to stop the tears that were welling up.</p><p>Why were\nyou crying?</p><p>Was it his\nfault?</p><p>You were\nthere all the time&hellip;</p><p>He wanted\nto run to you, run and comfort you, hold you close and kiss every tear away&hellip;\nbut he couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>You thought\nhe was in Korea.</p><p>He had lied\nto you.</p><p>He looked back\nat you, wishing you&rsquo;d accidently see him&hellip; force him to explain&hellip; but his legs\nmanaged to carry him the way to the exit.</p><p>Taehyung\nwalked with a heavy heart out of the airport, passing by the ticket offices and\nneglecting them. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just\nbook it on my phone&hellip;&rdquo; He thought.</p><p>All he\nwanted was to shower and lie down now.</p><p>He searched\nup the nearest hotel on his phone and luckily there was an airport hotel right\nnearby.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nhave any rooms available for one night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We do!\nWould you like a single or double room?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Single\nplease.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\n1600 koruna for one night. Can I borrow your passport and credit card please?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung\nhanded the receptionist what he asked for.</p><p>A short\nwhile later he was handed them back together with a room key.</p><p>&ldquo;Breakfast\nis included and is served in the room behind you between 6am and 10am.&rdquo; The\nreceptionist smiled and gestured towards the dining room.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Why\nwouldn&rsquo;t he pick up!? Did his phone die?</p><p>A second\nmore and you would&rsquo;ve started considering going back home until he hinted on\nvisiting you.</p><p>You wanted\nto call him back again and convince him to come visit you! You wanted him here\nwith you and for once it felt like he really was there and then suddenly he\nwasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>You gave\nup.</p><p>Your\nfeelings weren&rsquo;t going to go away, not like this.</p><p>A tear\nescaped your eye and ran down your cheek.</p><p>You cursed\nsilently.</p><p>Why did\nyour heart have to love him of all people&hellip;?</p><p>A dumb\nquestion.</p><p>But this\nwas breaking your heart and you needed to board your flight soon.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The bed\nfelt soft against his bare back.</p><p>Taehyung\nlied down on the bed with a towel wrapped around his hips after his long\nshower.</p><p>He reached\nfor his phone and began to click through to the booking site.</p><p>The shower\nhelped him calm down and collect his thoughts. </p><p>All he\nneeded now was a good night&rsquo;s sleep and everything would be ok. He convinced\nhimself.</p><p>One night\nmeant you&rsquo;d be on your way to Norway tomorrow&hellip;</p><p>-No flights\navailable, please check other dates-</p><p>The day\nafter tomorrow&hellip;</p><p>There was\none flight, late.</p><p>He quickly\nbooked it.</p><p>Two nights\nin Prague&hellip; and getting up there another way would be a hassle. He didn&rsquo;t know\nwhat trains to take and driving was the last thing he would want to do alone in\na foreign country.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The\nmeetings in Kiev were long and you were hungry.</p><p>The bosses\nof the company did their very best to impress you and it all sounded good but\non an empty stomach it was hard for you to concentrate.</p><p>You knew\nthat if you mentioned lunch, lunch would be served. The places you had visited\nso far showed a concerning amount of respect towards you, almost as if they\nwere intimidated by you&hellip; which they should be, but you&rsquo;re a human too. Sure you\nrepresented a large company that had the upper hand of all of them, a bad\nimpression on you could cause them so much trouble but so far you hadn&rsquo;t\nstumbled upon anything besides the incident in Italy that was of concern.</p><p>The host of\nthe meeting announced a five minute break and you took your chance. You\napproached the older man and asked him when lunch would be served and suddenly\nthe schedule was shifted.</p><p>The other\nparticipants looked confused for a moment when he suddenly announced that he\nmeant lunch instead, not a five minute coffee break.</p><p>On your way\nto the cafeteria in the building you fished your phone out of your pocket and\nhad a quick glance.</p><p>No missed\ncalls.</p><p>Your heart\nsunk in your chest.</p><p>But now\nwasn&rsquo;t the time to concern yourself about him, you were here for work.</p><p>You\nshrugged the thoughts of Taehyung off.</p><p>Forget him.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung\nwalked around the city, admiring the old buildings and taking a few photos.</p><p>He brought\nhis camera along&hellip; just in case. He was happy and thankful for his decision.</p><p>While in\nthe center of town he also stopped by a few shops to by himself some more and\nwarmer clothes. Strolling through the streets he couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what\nit would be like to be here with you&hellip; You could go sightseeing together, hold\nhands, do some fun shopping and go to nice restaurants, take cute couple photos\nby the river&hellip; look at the old castle&hellip;</p><p>He felt\nlonely.</p><p>Should he\ncall you?</p><p>He decided\nno and instead called Jimin while walking back towards the bus stop to get back\nto the airport hotel.</p><p>Jimin\ndidn&rsquo;t pick up.</p><p>Not a\nsurprise considering that it was in the middle of the night over there.</p><p>If he\ncalled you, you&rsquo;d know that it was in the middle of the night&hellip;</p><p>He got on\nthe bus and put his headphones instead to listen to some music. He scrolled\nthrough Instagram during the bus ride and came across your photos from Estonia\nand now Kiev.</p><p>He liked\nthem and realized a second later that you&rsquo;d see that he had.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&hellip;\nnever mind.&rdquo; He sighed.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Your head\nhit the pillow hard after the long day.</p><p>Despite\nbeing tired you had agreed on following them out for a late night outing only\nto then leave it early and excuse yourself with that your flight was early the\nnext day, when it in fact was mid-day.</p><p>Your feet\nwere aching and resting on the bed was such a relief.</p><p>You felt\nstressed and exhausted, but your feed made it look like you were having the\nbest of times seeing all these places.</p><p>Your phone\nlit up every now and then from the few like of your photos of Kiev and to your\nsurprise you saw Taehyung&rsquo;s name among them.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t\nhe be sleeping?&rdquo;</p><p>You quickly\nsent him a text.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nawake?&rdquo;</p><p>After a\nlonger while he finally responded.</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t\nsleep :(&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nsleeping troubles are worrying me. Do you drink tea before bed? It might help&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try\nit. Don&rsquo;t worry about me though.&rdquo;</p><p>Whenever he\ntold you not to worry while you were worrying, it made you feel frustrated.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung I\nwill worry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok~&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop\ntexting me and go back to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;no&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;no&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not\ngoing to reply anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll\ncry myself to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop haha&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I miss you\na lot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I miss you\ntoo, but you still need to sleep. We can face time tomorrow when you wake up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When is your\nflight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah&hellip;\nwe can face time when I&rsquo;ve landed maybe? My flight is during the morning for\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>It took him\nlonger to reply this time.</p><p>&ldquo;ok&rdquo;</p><p>You wanted\nto send him something affectionate&hellip; but you couldn&rsquo;t get yourself to do it with\nease.</p><p>Perhaps a heart?\nA heart could be platonic&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;&#10084;&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&rdquo;</p><p>So much\nfor trying to get over him&hellip;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Would you figure out his\ncryptic message? Was it obvious that the hearts were meant to stand for &ldquo;I love\nu&rdquo;? </p><p>It was getting harder and\nharder for him to contain himself.</p><p>All he wanted was for his\nflight to Norway to come sooner&hellip; so he could hold you.</p><p>He was letting himself go\neven more, more than he already had. Maybe call it accidental flirting but deep\ndown it was intentional.</p><p>&ldquo;I miss you so much.&rdquo; He\nsent, trying to come across as pleading.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you wave\nme off?&rdquo;</p><p>His heart dropped.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Maybe anger would do? Yes,\nanger.</p><p>If you boiled up anger\ntowards him maybe it would be easier to let him go&hellip; but to what use? Did you\nwant to return home to him not being your friend anymore? </p><p>You instantly regretted\nsending that.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I thought I\nwouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle it.&rdquo; He typed out, being honest but then deleting\nthe later and only sending that he was sorry.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok, I understand if\nyou were busy.&rdquo;</p><p>That reply made him feel\neven worse.</p><p>&ldquo;Please wait for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just wait for me, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p><p>He placed his phone on the\nnightstand and it dinged when you responded but he didn&rsquo;t bother to look,\nassuming it was just a good night which back despite it being evening.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Your plane touched down in\nOslo on time and you were picked up by a pre-booked taxi to take you to your\nhotel near the business district.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung anxiously tried to\nwaste his time before his flight.</p><p>He locked his tiny suitcase\nin a locker at the airport and headed into town one last time.</p><p>Should he buy you a gift?</p><p>He walked past a few\njewelry shops and the idea intrigued him more and more.</p><p>What if you wouldn&rsquo;t like\nit?</p><p>Maybe you didn&rsquo;t want him\nto visit?</p><p>But you said you missed\nhim&hellip;</p><p>He stopped in front of the\nwindow of a shop and his eyes caught the attention of one of the rings\ndisplayed on a piece of red velvet fabric.</p><p>A ring?</p><p>Maybe it looked too much\nlike an engagement ring&hellip;</p><p>A thought suddenly struck\nhim but he quickly shrugged it off and continued walking.</p><p>He walked into a clothing\nstore instead and looked at the scarves and gloves&hellip; were you cold?</p><p>Did you have plenty of warm\nclothes with you?</p><p>You could borrow his scarf\nif you were cold&hellip; like you did once.</p><p>He suddenly found himself\nsurrounded with baby clothes, haven accidently walked into the kids section,\ndistracted with thoughts.</p><p>A tiny pair of gloves\ncaught his attention and he couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from feeling the soft fabric.</p><p>/Why am I so dumb&hellip;?/</p><p>He sighed and left the\nstore.</p><p>Maybe he should just get to\nthe airport early and wait there instead&hellip;</p><p>It felt like the whole town\nwas suddenly crowded with couples and families, all happy people in love\nsurrounding him&hellip;</p><p>His heart was aching and he\nquickly fled towards the bus stop to head to the airport.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The business you were\nvisiting had surprisingly prepared a boat ride in the fjord for all the\nparticipants, something that had you very excited. The boat would take you to a\nconference center where you&rsquo;d have a few meetings. Before that you had already\nbeen shown around the facility and gotten answers on all of your questions. The\nday would end with a big dinner later that evening.</p><p>The rain was hanging in the\nclouds but it had yet to fall over the city when you all climbed onboard the\nboat.</p><p>You eagerly took pictures\nof the beautiful scenery and quickly sent one to Taehyung. </p><p>You chatted with one of the\nparticipants and he eagerly told you about their food culture and the history\nof fishing.</p><p>It was a beautiful city, a\nlot smaller to the size than you had expected, but still stunning nonetheless.\nIt had certain serenity and calm that wasn&rsquo;t common for capitals.</p><p>You wanted to return.</p><p>Luckily you had your few\nfree days to spend here before you headed to France.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>As the plane approached\nthere was a stunning view of city lights. </p><p>The lights became fewer and\nfewer the lower the plane flew and the occasional light appeared again when it\nflew over a highway. A mere moment later the colorful lights of the runway were\nin sight and the plane touched down with a gentle thud.</p><p>He hurried off the plane,\ngot a stamp in his passport by the border and grabbed the first taxi to take\nhim into the city.</p><p>There was no time to waste.</p><p>He walked into the first\nhotel he could find and paid for three nights.</p><p>The hotel was large and\nlavish looking and not too far away was the royal palace.</p><p>Taehyung dropped his bag\noff in his room quickly and then ran out into the night.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The dinner had come to an\nend and you were all saying your goodbyes. According to your phone your hotel\nwas a short walk from where you had been eating so you decided to enjoy the\ncool midnight air with a walk back.</p><p>The streets were empty and\nlit up by shop windows and street lights.</p><p>A cold wind from the fjord\nwhistled through the city, making you shiver and pull your coat tighter around\nyou.</p><p>Your phone suddenly rang.</p><p>You heart skipped a beat\nwhen you read Taehyung&rsquo;s name on the screen. You had forgotten that you were\ngoing to face time when you landed! You groaned in annoyance at yourself and\nquickly picked up.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you!?&rdquo; He\nscreamed, out of breath.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- I&rsquo;m in Oslo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where!?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked around.</p><p>&ldquo;Near the train station&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stay there!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung what&rsquo;s the\nmatter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just stay there!&rdquo; He cried\nout.</p><p>Your heartbeat increased\nand you began to feel unsafe.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung this isn&rsquo;t\nfunny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait for what!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go to the train station!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, ok&hellip; I&rsquo;m going, but\nwhy?&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t respond, all you\ncould hear was his uneasy breathing, making it sound like he was running.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>He could see the train\nstation, but not you.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; He asked\nagain.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t know, it says\noe&hellip;&oslash;stbanehallen on the building.&rdquo; You said, struggling to pronounce it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nwhite and there&rsquo;s a statue in front of it. Why are you asking?&rdquo;</p><p>He started running again,\naround the corner of the large building, desperate to find you.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung? Hello?&rdquo; You\nrepeated, you were getting cold and you wanted to go back, what was he doing?</p><p>The phone call cut off.</p><p>You looked at your phone\nwith a confused expression and put it back in your pocket as you began to walk\nagain.</p><p>But you were stopped by the\ncall of your name.</p><p>You turned around at the\nsound of the familiar voice, in disbelief.</p><p> &ldquo;Taehyung?!&rdquo;</p><p>He was running towards you,\nhis phone dead in his hand, breathing heavily and tears streaming down his\nface.</p><p>His strong arms wrapped\naround your waist and pulled you close and cried out against your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;F- finally&hellip;&rdquo; He panted.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;\nYou asked, hugging him back. </p><p>Holding back the tears of relief\nfrom seeing him, feeling his arms around you and his sudden presence was\ndifficult. One tear managed to escape your eye at first and you sniffled\nsoftly.</p><p>&ldquo;Something I should&rsquo;ve done\nlong ago!&rdquo; He cried.</p><p>His cold hands suddenly\ngrabbed the sides of your face and before you could react his lips crashed\nagainst yours.</p><p>There was no turning back\nnow.</p><p>The bottle overflowing with\nfeeling for him had been kicked over and smashed.</p><p>You held your arms around\nhim tighter and pressed back against the kiss, tears falling freely.</p><p>He pulled back, your lips\nmaking a low smack sound and his hands still on the sides of your face when he\nlooked you deeply in the eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; You\nalmost whispered, drowned out by your tears.</p><p>He kissed you again and one\nof his hands fell to your side.</p><p>His kiss was passionate and\nfilled with desire&hellip; making out with you, releasing all suppressed feelings.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you come all this way\nto tell me that?&rdquo; You sniffed, when he pulled away again.</p><p>&ldquo;and that I&rsquo;m sorry for not\nwaving you off, I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you showed up I\nwould&rsquo;ve stayed.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled and stroked his\nthumb across your cheekbone to wipe your tears away.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it was better that I\nshowed up here instead.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and leaned in to\nkiss him more.</p><p>You pressed your forehead\nagainst his.</p><p>&ldquo;You must be so tired&hellip;&rdquo; You\nsniffled.</p><p>&ldquo;I rested when I was in\nPrague.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were in Prague?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;and Amsterdam to go to\nEstonia and then cancelled my flight and rebooked on the spot to Prague\ninstead.&rdquo; He giggled. &ldquo;I chased you all this way&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung&hellip;&rdquo; You looked up\ninto his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo; You giggled through the tears.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy for you.&rdquo; He\nkissed your forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;I almost had you in Prague\nbut I arrived at the wrong terminal and they wouldn&rsquo;t let me through&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; we facetimed&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hid in the bathroom so\nyou wouldn&rsquo;t see where I was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why- Why didn&rsquo;t you just\ntell me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to tell you in\nperson.&rdquo;</p><p>You hid your face against\nhis chest.</p><p>His hand patted your head\nsoothingly and you stayed like that for a while.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you staying?&rdquo;\nYou asked, looking back up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;The grand, I think it was\ncalled. Where are you staying?&rdquo; His hand caressed your cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Near the barcode\ndistrict.&rdquo; You sniffed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the name of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I walk you there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You shook your head\nand hid against his chest again. &ldquo;I want to stay with you. You&rsquo;re not allowed\nto leave me now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you say sweetie.&rdquo;\nHe kissed your head. His voice was so soothing and calm&hellip; making you miss him\neven more despite him being in your arms.</p><p>He reached for his scarf\nand un-wrapped it from his neck, placing it around you instead. His hand\ngrabbed your hand, locking fingers and you began walking back to his hotel.</p><p>You held onto his arm with\nyour other hand, refusing to let go of him whatever would happen.</p><p>He smiled shyly.</p><p>His hotel was barely five\nminutes away and you quickly got back into the warm indoors and headed straight\nfor his room.</p><p>He took off his coat and\nhung it on the hook by the door and walked over to his tiny carry-on suitcase.</p><p>You took off your coat and\nhis scarf and hung it on the hook as well and took a seat on the large bed in\nhis room.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re staying the night.&rdquo;\nTaehyung claimed shyly and handed you one of his new t-shirts from his\nsuitcase.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying as long as you\nare, we can get my stuff tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung smiled, getting to\nhear exactly what he wanted to hear.</p><p>You suddenly felt the\ndelicate touch of his fingers under your chin as he tilted your face up.

It took a while to get home but during the way\nyou were occupied admiring your fianc&eacute;es hands on the wheel, more specifically\nthe dainty silver ring on his ring finger, his engagement ring.</p><p>Why should you be the only\none to have such a prized possession? He was engaged too.</p><p>You grabbed his wrist and\nslid your hand down into his as you walked to your apartment from the car park.</p><p>He smiled proudly, holding\nyour flowers for you.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;\nHe asked sweetly, noticing you looking down.</p><p>&ldquo;You have such pretty\nhands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; He smiled widely,\nblushing cheeks puffing up.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You walked into your\nbedroom to get changed into something more comfortable from your formal dress\nbut you struggled to reach the zipper in the back. You gave up with a sigh and\npopped your head out of the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He turned around to\nlook you way from the sofa in the living room.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t reach the zipper&hellip;\ncan you help me?&rdquo; You pouted.</p><p>He immediately stood up and\nwalked over to your room.</p><p>You turned your back\nagainst him and moved your hair to the side.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it might be stu-&ldquo;</p><p>He cut you off by kissing\nyour neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix!&rdquo; </p><p>He grabbed the zipper and\ncarefully pulled it down slowly, all the way down to your waist, were it came\nto a stop.</p><p>His finger trailed lightly\nup your spine, giving you shivers.</p><p>You only needed help with\nthe zipper&hellip;</p><p>He slipped your dress off\nyour shoulders, tracing kisses against your left shoulder, following the slow\nmovement of his hand.</p><p>The dress fell to the\nfloor, leaving you in only your bra, panties and thigh high socks.</p><p>You let him continue.</p><p>He unhooked your bra,\nslipping the straps off your shoulder and repeating his move on your right\nshoulder.</p><p>You quickly grew slightly\naroused by his touch and your bra joined the dress on the floor.</p><p>You covered your breasts\nwith your arms and looked back over your shoulder to see Taehyung unbuttoning\nhis shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Help me?&rdquo; He suggested,\nraising a brow.</p><p>You turned around fully and\nhe eyed you up and down, taking in the view with sudden lust filled eyes.</p><p>You moved your arms away\nand reached for the next button on his shirt. You gasped suddenly when his\nstrong arm wrapped around you and pulled you closer against his body.</p><p>You quickly unbuttoned the\nbuttons between you and he pulled his shirt off his broad shoulders and tossed\nit to the floor.</p><p>The next thing you knew,\nyou squealed as he picked you up and put you down on the bed. He let his hands\ncaress up your legs to the hem of your thigh high sock and slipped each one off\nyour legs slowly, one at the time.</p><p>Impatient, you sat back up,\ngrabbed his hair and pulled him close; crashing your lips against his in a kiss\nfueled by hunger and need. He crawled up on top of you on the bed and slipped\nhis tongue between your plump lips.</p><p>You wanted him.</p><p>He wanted you.</p><p>His hands moved up your\nsides, caressing your skin from your hip to your waist and up along the sides\nof your chest until he reached your breasts. He cupped each in one hand and\nsqueezed gently, making you let out a soft low moan against the kiss, arousal\ngrowing even stronger.</p><p>Your hands played with his\nlong soft hair, turning the neat curled style into a fluffed up mess while he\nexplored every surface of your breasts, fondling, squeezing, feeling&hellip; </p><p>His thumb and index pinched\nlightly at your left nipple, awakening your arousal even more and stronger and\nyou felt yourself getting wet under his touch.</p><p>He pulled away from the\nkiss and latched on to your right nipple, sucking on it roughly and pulling\ngently with his lips to make it even harder for him.</p><p>His other hand replaced his\nlips, pinching and twisting ever so gently while he hid his face in the crook\nbetween your neck and shoulder, placing soft kisses against your skin.</p><p>The touch of his soft wet\nlips tickled slightly and made you squirm.</p><p>He chuckled lightly at your\nreaction and playfully nibbled your skin, but enough to make it develop into a\nsmall bruised mark.</p><p>He moved up to your ear\nlobe instead and nibbled at it gently and let his hands fall to the sides of\nyou instead to support his body.</p><p>You pushed him over, rolling\non top of him, seated over his hips.</p><p>He looked up at you with\nwide eyes and a surprised expression.</p><p>You walked your hands up\nhis bare chest and leaned down by his ear, teasingly repeating his own move and\nsucking softly at his ear lobe, tugging at it gently with your lips. </p><p>A giggle tickled his ear.</p><p>You had your left hand\nagainst the side of his thick neck, caressing it passionately and feeling his\nsmooth skin.</p><p>He seemed to like it,\nlooking up at you with dark eyes and a wide smirk.</p><p>His hands travelled up your\nthighs while your lips trailed kisses down his neck to his collarbone.</p><p>You gently squeezed your\nleft hand around his neck, earning a low moan.</p><p>You sat up straight, hands\npressed against his chest. When you lowered yourself to sit on him you felt his\nhard bulge poke you through his black jeans. You climbed off him instead and he\nwas quick to tackle you and get back on top.</p><p>You reached for his belt\nbuckle and pulled at it a few times before unbuckling his belt. Taehyung placed\na kiss on your lips and sat up on his knees over you and unzipped his jeans,\npulling them down his thighs, exposing his hard cock straining against the\nfabric of his boxers.</p><p>He got off you and quickly\ntook his jeans off, kicking them off the bed, leaving you in an equal amount of\nclothing. Getting back on top his lips immediately found yours and he kissed\nyou passionately, lips sucking on lips, tongue swirling around tongue, quickly\nbecoming a mess.</p><p>He pulled away, not far.\nHis nose brushed against yours and his hand cupped the side of your face. His\nthumb caressed your lower lip, dragging across it slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful.&rdquo; He\nwhispered.</p><p>&ldquo;So are you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So beautiful&hellip;&rdquo; He pressed\nhis forehead against yours.</p><p>Your fingers found the hem\nof his boxers and pulled them down slowly as far as you could before he stood\nup straight on his knees again, touch abandoning you.</p><p>He hooked his finger under\nthe side of your panties and began to slip them down your legs as far as\npossible before he got off of you and yanked them off completely.</p><p>His hands reached for\nhimself, sliding his boxers down his hips, exposing himself.</p><p>He grabbed his thick cock\nwith one hand after successfully getting rid of the last remaining piece of\nclothing keeping you apart.</p><p>The tip was slightly pink,\nbegging for touch, achingly hard and aroused.</p><p>A few subtle veins trailed\nup his length from the very base of his cock.</p><p>He looked good&hellip;</p><p>Aren&rsquo;t people the most\nattractive when they&rsquo;re aroused and horny?</p><p>His hand slowly stroked\nhimself and he swallowed, looking down at you.</p><p>You sat up, grabbed his\nshoulder and pushed him back down on the bed, straddling him.</p><p>His hand immediately left\nhis cock, making it fall against his lower abdomen as both his hands grabbed\nyour waist.</p><p>You positioned yourself and\nbegan to grind gently against his cock, making him bite his lip. Sliding up and\ndown his lengths, coating him with your arousal that was just making you more\nand more wet, aching for relief.</p><p>You had your hands pressed\nagainst his chest, one of Taehyung&rsquo;s hands left your waist to caress your wrist\ninstead. You stopped your movements and leaned down to kiss him.</p><p>A final kiss before you\nwouldn&rsquo;t be able to contain yourself anymore&hellip;</p><p>You pulled away, leaving\nhim needy for your lips to return. You reached down and wrapped your hand\ngently around his cock, dragging the tip up and down your slit a few times before\nyou lowered yourself, positioning the tip by your entrance and sliding down his\nthick length halfway.</p><p>Your hand returned to his\nchest and he thrusted upwards, desperate to slip in further, for you to take\nhis full length. Your nails scratched his skin softly and you let him slide in\nall the way, stretching you out. He felt so good&hellip;</p><p>You pushed yourself up and\nlowered yourself back down again, picking up a slow pace. He exhaled deeply\nunder you as you began to ride him faster, sliding up and down half his length before\nyou pushed down all the way, making both of you let out a whimpering moan. You\npicked up your speed fast, sliding up and down his thick cock from right\nbeneath his head to the very base. </p><p>His big hands grabbed your\nhips, guiding you and making it even harder to contain the sounds of pleasure needing\nto escape your throat.</p><p>You leaned your head back,\nsmiling widely as pleasure took over all your senses. You felt sexy riding him\nlike this&hellip;</p><p>You grabbed his hand from\nyour hip and locked your fingers with his, pressing his hand back against the\nbed, doing the same with the other and leaning down to kiss him.</p><p>He moaned against the kiss,\ndesperate to push you back down on his cock but his hands squeezed your tightly\nas you suffocated his helpless needy whimpers with your tongue.</p><p>Your thighs were giving in,\nbut you didn&rsquo;t want to give in now&hellip; not when you were feeling the sweet feeling\nleading up to your climax.</p><p>Out of breath you pulled\naway from the kiss and Taehyung noticed your building exhaustion. He used his strength\nand pushed your hands back, making you lose your grip of his hands and he\nquickly wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled you down against his\nchest, making him slip out and he rolled over, now on top of you.</p><p>He kissed your lips and\nthrusted back in hard and deep, making you moan loud.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take over now baby.&rdquo;\nHe whispered.</p><p>He went hard.</p><p>Full force.</p><p>Thrusting deep, hard and\nfast.</p><p>Immediately sending you\nclose to the edge.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it feel good?&rdquo; He\nasked in a cocky tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm&rdquo; You hummed, holding\nonto him tight.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a good girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you, you\nknow that huh?&rdquo; He panted, repeatedly praising you.</p><p>He moaned loudly.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned in by your ear,\nmaking you able to hear his heavy breathing even more.</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re so good at\ntaking my cock.&rdquo; He chuckled, devilishly.</p><p>He hummed in pleasure\nagainst your ear and you grabbed on even tighter, fingers desperately searching\nfor grip on his shoulder blades when you felt your muscles tense up.</p><p>He thrusted harder, earning\na moan on the border to a scream.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m close.&rdquo; He whispered\nand pounded harder into you again.</p><p>&ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; You begged.</p><p>He went faster, sweat\nforming on his skin, chest almost heaving and long low whimpers escaping his\nthroat while he chased both your highs.</p><p>&ldquo;T-Taehyung&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, baby?&rdquo;</p><p>In the heat of the moment\nhe licked up the side of your neck.</p><p>You dug your fingertips\ndeeper into his toned back muscles.</p><p>Another fast hard thrust\nand your muscles claimed all control from you. Tensing tightly before releasing\nhard, heart beat racing, thighs aching and muscles pulsating tight and hard\naround his cock. </p><p>He let out a few grunts and\nhis thrusts became slower and deeper. </p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m gonna cum.&rdquo; He\nwhimpered.</p><p>Another slow deep thrust\nand he suddenly let out a deep exhale mixed with a low moan as his muscles\nfinally gave in and you could feel him throbbing as he came.</p><p>He kissed you, exhausted but\noverwhelmed by pleasure. He let out another soft moan against your lips, still\ncumming.</p><p>After a short while he\nleaned back and carefully pulled out his sensitive cock.</p><p>He lied down on his side and\nyou rolled over on to your side, moving close to him and he wrapped a strong\narm around your waist, pulling you even closer and placing a soft kiss against\nyour forehead.</p><p>Like this, you felt\nprotected by him.</p><p>The energy along with his\nglow made him appear like the strongest most attractive man&hellip;</p><p>You snuggled up against his\nwarm chest and heard his heart beating rapidly. You placed your hand over it\nsoothingly and he smiled at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you hear my heart?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beating fast.&rdquo; You\npointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;Because of you.&rdquo; He\nchuckled and brushed his hand through your hair. &ldquo;My love.&rdquo;</p><p>His words made you blush.</p><p>You placed a soft kiss\nagainst his heart.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The engine of the aircraft\nroared and it increased in speed rapidly before taking off for the sky.</p><p>Your hand was tightly held\nby the man in the seat next to you.</p><p>On his ring finger were two\nrings&hellip; just like on yours.</p><p>The hand belonged to your\nhusband.</p><p>And his hand belonged to\nyou.</p><p>You were admiring the view\nof the city below becoming smaller and smaller for a while and then turned to\nyour side to look lovingly at your husband.</p><p>First class, free upgrade\nthanks to your previous travels.</p><p>And now you were returning.</p><p>But this time without one\nchasing the other. This time instead, to spend the time lovingly with each\nother, experiencing what you did separately then, together now, on your\nhoneymoon.</p><p>First class served\nchocolate covered strawberries, a treat you both eagerly devoured.</p><p>First stop Oslo, next stop\nFrance. The city Paris, to be exact, the city known as the city of romance&hellip;</p><p>What better place to\ncelebrate your love than where it first bloomed and where it then could grow\neven wilder.</p><p>Taehyung raised your hand\nto his face and pressed his soft pink lips gently against your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;It feels nice to finally\nfly with you.&rdquo; He confessed, putting an emphasis on &ldquo;with&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you actually fly?&rdquo;\nYou asked curious.</p><p>Taehyung leaned back\nagainst his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;First I flew to Amsterdam,\nthen I was going to fly to Copenhagen and change to a flight to Tallinn, but\nthen you texted me saying you were suddenly going to Italy again and then to\nPrague and because my flight to Copenhagen was delayed I luckily saw that text\nand ran to the first counter I could find and asked them to book me a ticket to\nPrague instead but then you were heading to Norway and I was stuck in Prague\nbecause all flights were fully booked until the same night I finally reached\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really are crazy.&rdquo; You\nchuckled and leaned your head on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;It was the most important\ntrip of my life&hellip; the second I looked at the time to see that your flight had\ntaken off, I just broke down and I knew it was too late&hellip; unless I did what I\ndid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; You said,\ntearing up.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; He kissed\nyour head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I married you!&rdquo; He chuckled, returning to his initial\nmood.</p><p>Talking about that trip always\nmade your heart feel heavy, but not in a bad way but in the overwhelming way,\nhow this man loved you so much that he chased you across the world only to\nconfess his love to you&hellip;</p><p>Saying yes to him was the\neasiest choice you had ever made, thanks to the hardest choice you ever had\nto make.</p></p>",
