In every school there\u2019s always the jerks and they decided that since you\u2019re younger than them, they\u2019d tease you. It started out as a joke but everyday it becomes worse, they make you feel so bad about yourself that you\u2019ve considered just ending it all. But they\u2019ve suggested it and you kind of wanted to prove them wrong. You\u2019ve got some fight in you but not enough to rid of them. </p><p>Yesterday had been the worse day yet. You\u2019ve started to lose hope, you\u2019re not sure what to do. There\u2019s so much school stress but on top of that there\u2019s the feeling of not being good enough. You\u2019re not overweight but you\u2019re not skinny either. Like Steve says, \u201cYou\u2019re just the right amount, you don\u2019t need to be some skinny chick, you\u2019re perfect the way you are.\u201d You believed that for about a month but then those jerks started to pick on you for your weight. You had tried to stand up to them but it did nothing. They laughed while they spat insulting things about your weight to you. You started to believe them. In the mornings, you can\u2019t help but stare at your body. The insults rolling around in your mind. </p><p>You\u2019ve started to skip breakfast, they usually cook something that\u2019s unhealthy so you figured that it would be better to not eat breakfast. Although, you grab an apple and eat that on the way to school. You\u2019ve started skipping lunch at the cafeteria too. Steve and Tony, the dads of the tower, have noticed how you\u2019ve started to slim down and stop eating. You\u2019re not as happy and cheerful as you used to be. They tried to get Nat to talk to you but you wouldn\u2019t even let her into your room. The team got together and tried to figure out a plan to help you, but you didn\u2019t want their help no matter how much you pleaded for help in your eyes. The sadness and loss of hope. They hate seeing you like this. You\u2019re a ghost of your former self.</p><p>You grab an apple and start to walk to school, but Steve runs up in front of you and stops you. You pause yourself right before you take a bite of your apple. You raise an eyebrow at him. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d He says calmly but he shows a hint of worry.</p><p>\u201cI have to get to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it won\u2019t be long, I promise.\u201d He says as he guides you back into the kitchen where everyone is seated. \u201cListen, we\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019ve been changing a lot lately and some of your changes aren\u2019t\u2026-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHealthy,\u201d Clint pipes up. \u201cListen, kid.

You drop your bag and apple, holding your face in your hands. How did you let it get this bad without telling them? How did you think that you could do this on your own? You should have told them, they always comfort you. You feel their familiar warmth engulf you.

Well, except for how he\u2019s the playboy billionaire heir to Stark Industries and working on two PhDs. Oh, and 6 months ago he was kidnapped by - well, no one really knows who. Since his rescue (excuse you, Tony liberated himself), he\u2019s also been keeping a pretty big secret. Here\u2019s a hint: it\u2019s shiny, red and gold, and flies. Tony\u2019s had a productive couple of months, but the fact that his grandfather keeps trying to hire bodyguards for his \u201csafety\u201d is really putting a cramp in his ability to keep his secret superhero identity, well, a secret.</p><p>Steve Rogers wakes up in 2015 and finds out that he\u2019s missed 70 years (Oh god, does this mean he\u2019s 94?), a revelation that he handles with much less grace than usual. Mostly, Steve just wants to be Captain America again, but on his own terms and without a lot of fanfare. To fill the time while Steve tries to figure out the best way to resurrect a dead superhero, his good friend Isaac Stark offers him a job: bodyguard to Isaac\u2019s grandson, Tony Stark - who seems to get into a surprising amount of trouble for a teenager. \u201cThere\u2019s no better introduction to the 21st century than through Tony,\u201d says Isaac.

For one thing, he keeps looking at Tony as though he reminds him of someone else, and even if he never says anything, Tony&rsquo;s pretty sure it&rsquo;s his father. A lifetime of not measuring up to Howard&rsquo;s expectations is more than enough, thank you very much, and he&rsquo;s certainly not going to make an effort to live up to any of Steve&rsquo;s.
