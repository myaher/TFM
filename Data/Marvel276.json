I know they don&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re dating but how hard is it for them to not say shit behind the back of the person who houses them, feeds them, makes their gear, deals with the press and makes sure they don&rsquo;t get in trouble with the government for their latest recklessness? He sighs when he doesn&rsquo;t get a response walking into the bedroom to find Tony curled up in the bed. The huge bed making Tony look so small, he looked so peaceful in his sleep that Bucky wanted to cuddle up to him and stay in this moment forever. He got rid of his shoes, socks and clothes and got into bed behind Tony in his underwear, wrapping the blanket around both of them, and spooned up to him.</p><p>Bucky was woken by Tony shifting in his arms. He opened his eyes to see Tony&rsquo;s beautiful face staring at him, looking well rested. Bucky wanted to keep him here,in his arms, and protect him from the world. He never would have thought that he&rsquo;d have this, curled up in the bed with the man he loved. He didn&rsquo;t think he could find someone, not when he was growing up in the 20s when being like he was could get him killed and he definitely wasn&rsquo;t allowed to think of anything as frivolous as romance during his time as a HYDRA prisoner. He vaguely remembered being awake when gay marriage was legalized. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine living in a time where he would find love, get married and adopt kids if they wanted to. And now him and Tony couldn&rsquo;t even be happy in Tony&rsquo;s own house because his so called teammates hated him with a passion and they&rsquo;d rip him to pieces if they found out he was dating Bucky. No matter how much he wanted to be able to show off his love for his boyfriend Bucky would rather keep quiet about them than let those people hurt Tony any more because of him. Tony already could barely wander into the common areas of the tower without being driven out by thinly veiled insults.</p><p>Tony walked into the living room where everyone was gathered and watching tv half asleep, looking like a zombie, and collapsed onto Bucky who automatically gathered him up into his arms not noticing the startled looks others were giving them. All the so called Avengers were \u00a0ready to fight as if Tony was some intruder attacking Bucky like he couldn\u2019t handle himself. He was a trained assassin, if he wanted Tony off of him he wouldn\u2019t care that he was half asleep. And the witch, the witch had her hands shrouded in the scarlet mist given to her by HYDRA, the Soldier was growling in his head, screaming at him to protect Tony from her and the others, especially after Tony confided in him about what she\u2019d done. Steve was slowly approaching him, \u201cBucky, are you ok? Should I ask Stark to move away?\u201d he asked which just made the Soldier growl louder and made him angrier. \u201cIf I wanted him off me I would have woken him, Rogers.\u201d he spat which made them even more alert. \u201c\u0421\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u044c, \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442!\u201d the Widow said, displaying authority she never had. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Soldier here, Romanoff. I am in full control and have some words for you all.\u201d Tony would have definitely been embarrassed with what he was about to say but Bucky hoped he would forgive him for outing them to these people. \u201cTony Stark is graciously letting you stay here for no cost. He\u2019s been avoiding places in his own home because of you. And instead of being gracious as any normal person would, you all say bad things about him. You\u2019re supposed to be his friends, his family but you lie, berate and betray him at every turn. The worst part is you don\u2019t even care\u201d Bucky pauses to breathe and apparently the Scarlet Witch takes it as an invitation \u201cHe\u2019s a monster. He sold weapons. He killed thousands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going in that route, Steve, Sam and I are soldiers.Natasha and Clint are super spies. Dr. Banner is Hulk and you worked for HYDRA.

He stopped selling weapons the moment he knew it was being used wrong. He was betrayed by a man who was like a father to him. Soon after he was kidnapped and tortured by terrorists who had been hired by that man. I can\u2019t even imagine what he would have been going through, and to make that kind of a life changing decision during hard times needs strength. He\u2019s been through so much and all you people are doing is bullying him\u201d Steve looked like he\u2019d been slapped when the words left Bucky\u2019s mouth but he still spoke up \u201cWhy are you defending him though?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m defending Tony because he deserves to be defended, because he\u2019s an amazing person.

I know they don&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re dating but how hard is it for them to not say shit behind the back of the person who houses them, feeds them, makes their gear, deals with the press and makes sure they don&rsquo;t get in trouble with the government for their latest recklessness? He sighs when he doesn&rsquo;t get a response walking into the bedroom to find Tony curled up in the bed. The huge bed making Tony look so small, he looked so peaceful in his sleep that Bucky wanted to cuddle up to him and stay in this moment forever. He got rid of his shoes, socks and clothes and got into bed behind Tony in his underwear, wrapping the blanket around both of them, and spooned up to him.</p><p>Bucky was woken by Tony shifting in his arms. He opened his eyes to see Tony&rsquo;s beautiful face staring at him, looking well rested. Bucky wanted to keep him here,in his arms, and protect him from the world. He never would have thought that he&rsquo;d have this, curled up in the bed with the man he loved. He didn&rsquo;t think he could find someone, not when he was growing up in the 20s when being like he was could get him killed and he definitely wasn&rsquo;t allowed to think of anything as frivolous as romance during his time as a HYDRA prisoner. He vaguely remembered being awake when gay marriage was legalized. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine living in a time where he would find love, get married and adopt kids if they wanted to. And now him and Tony couldn&rsquo;t even be happy in Tony&rsquo;s own house because his so called teammates hated him with a passion and they&rsquo;d rip him to pieces if they found out he was dating Bucky. No matter how much he wanted to be able to show off his love for his boyfriend Bucky would rather keep quiet about them than let those people hurt Tony any more because of him. Tony already could barely wander into the common areas of the tower without being driven out by thinly veiled insults.</p><p>Tony walked into the living room where everyone was gathered and watching tv half asleep, looking like a zombie, and collapsed onto Bucky who automatically gathered him up into his arms not noticing the startled looks others were giving them. All the so called Avengers were &nbsp;ready to fight as if Tony was some intruder attacking Bucky like he couldn&rsquo;t handle himself. He was a trained assassin, if he wanted Tony off of him he wouldn&rsquo;t care that he was half asleep. And the witch, the witch had her hands shrouded in the scarlet mist given to her by HYDRA, the Soldier was growling in his head, screaming at him to protect Tony from her and the others, especially after Tony confided in him about what she&rsquo;d done. Steve was slowly approaching him, &ldquo;Bucky, are you ok? Should I ask Stark to move away?&rdquo; he asked which just made the Soldier growl louder and made him angrier. &ldquo;If I wanted him off me I would have woken him, Rogers.&rdquo; he spat which made them even more alert. &ldquo;&#1057;&#1090;&#1086;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100;, &#1057;&#1086;&#1083;&#1076;&#1072;&#1090;!&rdquo; the Widow said, displaying authority she never had. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the Soldier here, Romanoff. I am in full control and have some words for you all.&rdquo; Tony would have definitely been embarrassed with what he was about to say but Bucky hoped he would forgive him for outing them to these people. &ldquo;Tony Stark is graciously letting you stay here for no cost. He&rsquo;s been avoiding places in his own home because of you. And instead of being gracious as any normal person would, you all say bad things about him. You&rsquo;re supposed to be his friends, his family but you lie, berate and betray him at every turn. The worst part is you don&rsquo;t even care&rdquo; Bucky pauses to breathe and apparently the Scarlet Witch takes it as an invitation &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a monster. He sold weapons. He killed thousands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going in that route, Steve, Sam and I are soldiers.Natasha and Clint are super spies. Dr. Banner is Hulk and you worked for HYDRA.
