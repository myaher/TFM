It's about way more than just her being sore that she can't have kids. If she wanted to, she could have adopted a child and raised them as her own, and that would fix her heir issue. It's also why I don't buy the theory Sansa will rule the North as Elizabeth the Virgin Queen. She'd need an heir too, and Bran and Arya probably won't have kids.",
        "answer": "<p>Indeed they do, nonny and unfortunately Daenerys is anything but. I understand completely why this would be a sensitive subject for her or for most women with the inability to have children but as I said in a previous ask and at the risk of sounding repetitive (Let\u2019s be real we are already passed that point, lol) This isn\u2019t just something she can brush off or ignore. It\u2019s not something she can tuck away and never address. We see what happens the realm is left with either too many, or no heirs at all and the entire system is thrown into a vacuum of better claims and legitimacy. Daenerys wants to not only restore the Targaryen dynasty but she also wants to completely reestablish the system of this country. (Whatever she means by Breaking the Wheel) and she cannot hope this will be accomplished within her lifetime. </p><p>Tyrion laid some good options on how they might choose a successor to her rule and it actually fits quite nicely if we believe she wants to have a more democratic system like how the Night\u2019s Watch vote for who they want as their commander. Unfortunately Daenerys could never think this far ahead because she\u2019s willfully ignorant to what happens after she asends the throne and we see how reckless this kind of behavior can be. She doesn\u2019t want to address it and probably never will. </p><p>As for Sansa, agree as well! It would be the same issue for Sansa if she would ever become Queen in the North. Regardless of whomever she chooses to marry, she needs to marry as the established monarch of her House. We know Bran is the new Three Eyed Raven and it isn\u2019t likely he will marry or reproduce given the lack of any type of emotions from his powers. Arya, she could but the way her character is alone suggest the same thing. That leaves Sansa as the only one and if she were to end the series alone and without prospects of marriage and children, it would be a waste of all the foreshadowing and build up and political logic that comes with ruling and heirs etc. </p>",

Regardless of whomever she chooses to marry, she needs to marry as the established monarch of her House. We know Bran is the new Three Eyed Raven and it isn&rsquo;t likely he will marry or reproduce given the lack of any type of emotions from his powers. Arya, she could but the way her character is alone suggest the same thing. That leaves Sansa as the only one and if she were to end the series alone and without prospects of marriage and children, it would be a waste of all the foreshadowing and build up and political logic that comes with ruling and heirs etc. </p>",

That meant all the Stark children had to find a way\nto get back to Montana, no matter where the hell they were. Robb once had to\nfly in from London and then go back in less than 12 hours.</p><p>There were no excuses.\n(Sansa, Arya and Jon learned not to have concerts scheduled on the first\nSaturday of the month. It was that serious.)</p><p>Sansa normally loved\nthose dinners -it meant she could see her parents and her siblings -but today&hellip;\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just think that boy\nis extremely rude.\u201d Cat Stark commented as she cut her steak.</p><p>\u201cArthur Pendragon is the\ncoolest guy ever!\u201d Rickon protested.</p><p>Cat glared at her\nyounger son.</p><p>\u201cHe apologized.\u201d Arya\nreminded everyone. \u201cSansa even forgave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve accepted his\napology, it\u2019s different.\u201d She indicated.</p><p>Arya arched a brow at\nher sister. \u201cThat\u2019s why you two are exchanging covers now?\u201d</p><p>Sansa showed her tongue\nto her sister.</p><p>\u201cThe internet likes it.\u201d\nBran commented. \u201cThey\u2019re shipping you guys.\u201d</p><p>Ned stopped cutting his\nfood. \u201cShipping?

Can you believe this man? lol What should Sansa do now?</b></p><p><b>A few things\u2026</b></p><p><b>1- I thought it\u2019d be adorable for Ned to be confused with the term\u00a0\u2018shipping\u2019.

I\u2019ve repeatedly said I was\nsorry, but I\u2019ll say once again. I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said what I did.

Besides, Jon was the quietest among them. If he had an opinion,\nnormally it was worth listening to.</p><p>\u201cI just think you guys\nwould sound nice in a duet. Your voices would compliment each other.\u201d He\noffered.</p><p>Robb protested and Sansa\nthrew a piece of bread at her cousin. Her mother was not amused.</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa almost called\nArthur to ask what the hell he was thinking about. He was only adding gas to a\nfire that was burning quite well on its own.</p><p>After dinner finished\nand she went to her old room to hide, she decided to check the internet to see\nif people were really shipping them.</p><p>Oh yes\u2026 They were.</p><p>There were some fanarts\nand a dozen fanfictions.

Of course nothing was gone in the morning.</p><p>It was actually worse.</p><p>God worked fast, but\nfangirls worked even faster.</p><p>In the few days after\nthe interview, someone had made a fan video of one of her songs. Which, fair\nenough, happened sometimes. But never like this!</p><p>They picked a song from\nher second album -when she was under Cersei\u2019s influence -called \u201cLove won\u2019t let\nme go\u201d. She wasn\u2019t fond of this song anymore, because she basically wrote it to\nsay she loved Joffrey too much to leave, even though he was an abusive fucker.</p><p>However, they hadn\u2019t\nused only her image for it. They\u2019d used Arthur\u2019s as well.</p><p><i>Shiiiiiit!!!</i></p><p>All in all, it was\nridiculously well done, and in many moments it actually looked like they were\ntogether in scene. The person who\u2019d done it used scenes from Sansa\u2019s and\nCamelot\u2019s music videos, a few from red carpets and even Arthur\u2019s special\nparticipation on a biker series.</p><p>They also used some\nother actor and actress to complete some parts. Sansa was pretty sure some\nscenes with Arthur were actually shots of Scott Eastwood\u2019s back.</p><p>It obviously wasn\u2019t\nofficial or real, but it still looked good. A for effort and dedication.</p><p>And the person had\nposted and tagged them both in it.</p><p>Now, Sansa was tagged in\na lot of fan posts, so she hardly ever saw them all-unfortunately- but this\ntime, Arthur had replied to it.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t remember\nrecording this.

At this\npoint\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure he wants your body too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa just gaped at\nShae, getting red all over again.</p><hr><p><b>Notes: There you have it!</b></p><p><b>OMG ARTHUR!

That meant all the Stark children had to find a way\nto get back to Montana, no matter where the hell they were. Robb once had to\nfly in from London and then go back in less than 12 hours.</p><p>There were no excuses.\n(Sansa, Arya and Jon learned not to have concerts scheduled on the first\nSaturday of the month. It was that serious.)</p><p>Sansa normally loved\nthose dinners -it meant she could see her parents and her siblings -but today&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I just think that boy\nis extremely rude.&rdquo; Cat Stark commented as she cut her steak.</p><p>&ldquo;Arthur Pendragon is the\ncoolest guy ever!&rdquo; Rickon protested.</p><p>Cat glared at her\nyounger son.</p><p>&ldquo;He apologized.&rdquo; Arya\nreminded everyone. &ldquo;Sansa even forgave him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve accepted his\napology, it&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; She indicated.</p><p>Arya arched a brow at\nher sister. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you two are exchanging covers now?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa showed her tongue\nto her sister.</p><p>&ldquo;The internet likes it.&rdquo;\nBran commented. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re shipping you guys.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned stopped cutting his\nfood. &ldquo;Shipping? Where to?&rdquo; He asked confused.</p><p>Arya snorted, and Jon\nhid his grin on his napkin. &ldquo;No, dad. It means they want them to be a couple.&rdquo;\nBran explained.</p><p>Ned frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nlike this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, that&rsquo;s just people\ntalking.&rdquo; Sansa assured her father, after sending a glare to Bran. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t\nmean anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fortunately.&rdquo; Robb\ngrumbled from his place.</p><p>Rickon and Bran started\ntrading strange looks, then Bran shook his head urgently.</p><p>Cat arched a brow at the\ndisplay. &ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo;</p><p>The two boys traded\nguilty looks. &ldquo;You guys didn&rsquo;t see his interview?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What interview?&rdquo; Arya\nasked</p><p>\n&ldquo;He gave an interview to a podcast.&rdquo; Bran explained. &ldquo;We heard it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa threw a suspicious\nlook at her younger brothers. She was well aware that Rickon liked Camelot, but\nshe didn&rsquo;t know Bran was also a fan.</p><p>&ldquo;Did he say something\nabout Sansa?&rdquo; Robb demanded.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Kind of&hellip;&rdquo; Rickon shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Jon\nasked, clearly bothered by it.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon.&rdquo; Ygritte, his\ngirlfriend, rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Relax. He just talked more about the whole thing.\nHe even apologized again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nice of\nhim.&rdquo; Talisa, Robb&rsquo;s wife, cooed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard it?&rdquo; Sansa\nasked Ygritte.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Ygritte\nconfirmed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cool podcast, and they have good interviews. Haven&rsquo;t you\nchecked your phone? Because it&rsquo;s probably blowing up because of it.&rdquo;</p><p>As a matter of fact,\nSansa hadn&rsquo;t checked her phone since she&rsquo;d arrived at her parents&rsquo; house,\nbecause her mother always complained when they did it.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;I have it here.&rdquo; Bran\noffered.</p><p>&ldquo;Show us now!&rdquo; Arya\ndemanded.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Sansa protested,\nbut it was too late, her brother had already pulled his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like phones at\nthe dinner table.&rdquo; Cat reminded her son.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s short, I promise!&rdquo;\nBran indicated, then just went ahead. He found whatever he was looking for,\nfiddled with his phone for a while and then&hellip;</p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;some interesting\ncovers.&rdquo;</i> A male voice Sansa\ndidn&rsquo;t recognize.</p><p>The chuckle that came after\nwas all too familiar to her. <i>&ldquo;You could say that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s up between\nyou and Sansa Stark?&rdquo;</i> The man pressed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Just friendly banter.&rdquo;</i> Arthur replied, and she could just imagine that\nprick, sitting back, completely relaxed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;People are saying your\nkids would look great.&rdquo;</i>\nThe interviewer teased.</p><p><i>&ldquo;If they took after her,\nthey would.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Arya snorted.</p><p>The man laughed. <i>&ldquo;And\nyou say nothing is going on?&rdquo;</i> It was obvious he didn&rsquo;t believe it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</i> He popped the p.</p><p><i>&ldquo;But can we expect\nsomething soon?&rdquo; </i>The man pressed. <i>&ldquo;Maybe\na duet?&rdquo;</i></p><p>It was Arthur&rsquo;s turn to\nlaugh. <i>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;</i> Sansa gasped at his audacity. <i>&ldquo;The thing is, I\nwas an asshole, and I have no problem admitting it. I&rsquo;ve repeatedly said I was\nsorry, but I&rsquo;ll say once again. I shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve said what I did. Sansa Stark\nworked a lot to be here, and I have no right to call it bullshit just because\nmy style is different.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;People are saying\nyou&rsquo;re only apologizing because you got caught.&rdquo; </i>The man pointed out.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more concerned with\nStark&rsquo;s forgiveness.&rdquo;</i> Arthur threw back,\ncompletely unaffected.</p><p><i>&ldquo;And has she forgiven\nyou?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If she hasn&rsquo;t, I can\nalways cover &lsquo;When you pass by&rsquo;.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bran stopped the audio.\nAll the heads turned to Sansa. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to murder him if he covers &lsquo;When you\npass by&rsquo;.&rdquo; She hissed.</p><p>Arya decided it was the\nperfect moment to laugh her ass off. &ldquo;This is the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon, Talisa, Ygritte and\nRickon were also laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;He did sound contrite.&rdquo;\nNed observed.</p><p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t like\nhim.&rdquo; Cat decided.</p><p>&ldquo;I second that!&rdquo; Robb\nhurried to say.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not a vote.&rdquo;\nSansa pointed out. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;ll be no more covers and definitely no duets.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon opened his mouth,\nthen closed it again.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Sansa asked,\nresigned. Besides, Jon was the quietest among them. If he had an opinion,\nnormally it was worth listening to.</p><p>&ldquo;I just think you guys\nwould sound nice in a duet. Your voices would compliment each other.&rdquo; He\noffered.</p><p>Robb protested and Sansa\nthrew a piece of bread at her cousin. Her mother was not amused.</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa almost called\nArthur to ask what the hell he was thinking about. He was only adding gas to a\nfire that was burning quite well on its own.</p><p>After dinner finished\nand she went to her old room to hide, she decided to check the internet to see\nif people were really shipping them.</p><p>Oh yes&hellip; They were.</p><p>There were some fanarts\nand a dozen fanfictions. It was embarrassing and it reminded her why she\nshouldn&rsquo;t Google herself.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t read anything\nand ignored the terribly photoshopped montages of them.</p><p>Tomorrow it would be\ngone.</p><p>XxX</p><p>Why Sansa was still so\noptimistic was a mystery to herself. Of course nothing was gone in the morning.</p><p>It was actually worse.</p><p>God worked fast, but\nfangirls worked even faster.</p><p>In the few days after\nthe interview, someone had made a fan video of one of her songs. Which, fair\nenough, happened sometimes. But never like this!</p><p>They picked a song from\nher second album -when she was under Cersei&rsquo;s influence -called &ldquo;Love won&rsquo;t let\nme go&rdquo;. She wasn&rsquo;t fond of this song anymore, because she basically wrote it to\nsay she loved Joffrey too much to leave, even though he was an abusive fucker.</p><p>However, they hadn&rsquo;t\nused only her image for it. They&rsquo;d used Arthur&rsquo;s as well.</p><p><i>Shiiiiiit!!!</i></p><p>All in all, it was\nridiculously well done, and in many moments it actually looked like they were\ntogether in scene. The person who&rsquo;d done it used scenes from Sansa&rsquo;s and\nCamelot&rsquo;s music videos, a few from red carpets and even Arthur&rsquo;s special\nparticipation on a biker series.</p><p>They also used some\nother actor and actress to complete some parts. Sansa was pretty sure some\nscenes with Arthur were actually shots of Scott Eastwood&rsquo;s back.</p><p>It obviously wasn&rsquo;t\nofficial or real, but it still looked good. A for effort and dedication.</p><p>And the person had\nposted and tagged them both in it.</p><p>Now, Sansa was tagged in\na lot of fan posts, so she hardly ever saw them all-unfortunately- but this\ntime, Arthur had replied to it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, I don&rsquo;t remember\nrecording this. How drunk was I?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Was he serious? Did he\nwant to die?</p><p>A mischievous voice that\nSansa hardly ever listened to, told her to say something clever back. He always\nthought he was oh so charming, right?</p><p><i>&ldquo;Plenty, but you were\nvery cooperative.&rdquo;</i></p><p>That would show him.</p><p>XxX</p><p>And once again she&rsquo;d\noverestimated Arthur&rsquo;s common sense. She shouldn&rsquo;t have encouraged him.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe I forgot\nit. Can we redo it? I don&rsquo;t like my hair on this one.&rdquo; </i>He&rsquo;d attached a still that was quite obviously\nnot him, one of the parts where whoever made it used Scott Eastwood.</p><p>Who said things like\nthat? After the interview and now with this, people were seriously thinking\nthey were about to work together on a song.</p><p>How would something like\nthis even work? It wouldn&rsquo;t! Arthur had to stop encouraging those rumors with\nthis type of comment.</p><p>Honestly&hellip; His agent\nshould take over his Twitter account.</p><p>&ldquo;Just answer him!&rdquo; Shae\ninsisted.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not!&rdquo; Brienne cut\nin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already drowning in phone calls. Everybody wants to know if you&rsquo;ll be\nrecording something together.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa snorted. &ldquo;Sure we\nwill. As soon as he learns how to dance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that to\nanyone, even as a joke.&rdquo; Brienne begged.</p><p>&ldquo;Let her have some fun,\nBrienne.&rdquo; Shae rolled her eyes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hot rockstar wanting her attention.\nThis is the American dream.&rdquo;</p><p>Brienne was clearly\nunamused with the idea. &ldquo;I can talk to his agent if you want.&rdquo; She offered\nSansa.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sansa\nasked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be embarrassing, like my parents are calling his. I&rsquo;ll deal with\nit myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Brienne didn&rsquo;t seem\nconvinced. And when later Sansa tweeted a reply to Arthur -<i>&ldquo;Sure. Get your\npeople to call mine.&rdquo; </i>- Brienne made sure to show her displeasure over\ntext.</p><p>Sansa didn&rsquo;t mind. She\nwas having fun.</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa had just finished\nrehearsal with her uncle Benjen when she saw Shae waving her cellphone, a smirk\non her lips.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t even have to\nask to know who it was.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly be\nserious.&rdquo; She said by way of greeting.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You did tell me to contact\nyour people, Red.&rdquo; </i>Arthur drawled from the\nother side.<i> &ldquo;I have to say that I looked amazing in some parts of that\nvideo, not much in others.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Sansa snorted. &ldquo;You have\nway too much free time.
