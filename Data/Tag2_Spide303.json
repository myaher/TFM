A long time ago on the news. He was just a little boy, but he knew the danger and fear that this man could bring. Peter would sit by the front door and wonder if he would walk in. He would tower over the small boy. Wearing his leather boots and high-pointed helmet and ordering Peter to surrender his whole family to him. It was a silly childhood fear, but a fear that he couldn\u2019t shake off for a good amount of time. Loki was a nightmare for New York, without a doubt. Now, he seems almost ordinary. More broken than anything.</p><p>Anyway, what does Peter have to fear anymore? He\u2019s already dead.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d Peter says without any intent to be polite.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Loki shrugs. \u201cI just sort of\u2026walked in.\u201d Loki mumbles under his breath, \u201cwas sort of hoping someone else would be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get sucked up, too?\u201d Peter casually brushes back a tear.</p><p>Loki sighs and gives a sad look.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m a soul that doesn\u2019t really have a place. I\u2019ve been wandering around and you seem to be the first one to see me.\u201d Loki leans back into (literally) nothing. \u201cI suppose I should stick around then. It\u2019s not like I have anywhere else to be!\u201d</p><p>Peter furrows his brows and glares at the demigod. While he has no power to kick him out, he puts in an effort to make it clear that he\u2019s not welcome.</p><p>\u201cYou know mine, it\u2019s only fair I ask. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Loki appears to be ignoring Peter\u2019s harsh glare.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d he blinks. \u201cPeter Parker.\u201d He says automatically and winces. Maybe telling a sorcerer your name isn\u2019t the brightest idea.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Loki repeats. \u201cDo you choose to be alone or are you like me? Stuck and unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>Peter is silent. He wonders if honesty would even matter in this circumstance.</p><p>\u201cA little bit of both, I guess,\u201d Peter mumbles. \u201cTalking to the other souls here just makes it worse,\u201d he shrugs.</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Loki nods.</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Peter peers up.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like there is much here to talk about.

It doesn\u2019t sound like to particularly Peter, but the boy can\u2019t help but somewhat agree. Loki studies Peter\u2019s sad expression. A small part in his chest twinges at how hurt this stranger is.</p><p>He speaks without even thinking, \u201cWith that said, I wish I could tell you things are going to be alright, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Peter interrupts without a hint of humor. \u201cThat\u2019s all they say to me, here.\u201d He pulls his knees closer to his chest. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p></p>",
