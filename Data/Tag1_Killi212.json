        "body": "<p>Villanelle\u2019s character is very interesting in the fact that she is able to change her perception to others very easily. Since she has no innate idea of what is socially acceptable, as seen by scenes such as her copying the laugh of the radio host, or telling her\u00a0\u201cboyfriend\u201d she wants to do something\u00a0\u201cnormal\u201d. This makes her extremely dynamic because she can adapt to her situation, sometimes better than others. This is most prevalent in her interactions with men. In the fourth episode she is seen interacting with both a male and a female assassin. With the female assassin she shows her strength as a woman and they go head to head as both very strong willed characters with an unclear tumultuous history between them. However, this strength, when shown to the male character clearly makes him uncomfortable. In the same way that Bill was shown as being uncomfortable not being the boss to Eve in a previous episode, this male assassin is shown being uncomfortable with Villanelle being the boss as well. When she gives an order to move forward, he is quick to point out that he is the boss, and restates the exact same order. This mirroring of Eve and Villanelle\u2019s power in comparison to the men around them connect the two vastly different female leads in a way that addresses the male complex of power but also makes fun of it. With one specific character, Konstantin, Vilanelle is shown portraying her weakest facade. She is almost portraying herself as childlike, with her handler as almost a father figure. She appeals to him as a child who needs to be controlled but also begs for more autonomy. This dynamic between Vilanelle and the male characters in the show are almost comical in the sense that she just knows how to work the men in her life. The men are easily manipulated by her and she is therefore intrigued by the women, whether it be intellectual or sexual intrigue.\u00a0</p><p>Also killing Bill was an evil plot point especially just a scene after they made him a lovable queer icon, but that is besides the point.</p><p>-Liana</p>",

However, there is also the more rational part of my brain that is not so desperate for any form of representation it can get that groans at the prospect of this program reaching a wide audience that is most likely mostly straight. Being queer, I am able to detect which elements of this particular representation of queer folk is problematic and potentially damaging, take them into account, acknowledge their inaccuracy, and move on, allowing myself to enjoy the salvageable aspects of the show. This ability to separate fact from fiction is not likely shared by the majority of straight viewers. It is for this reason that I become so concerned when new representations of queer female characters fall into harmful stereotypes, several of which are present in this show. It is clear that there is a connection between Eve and Villanelle, though this connection is based in obsession, not love. Although there is certainly a sexual element to their intense interest in each other what with Eve\u2019s prolonged and detailed complimentary description of Villanelle\u2019s appearance and Villanelle calling one of her hook-ups Eve and dressing her in her clothes, that is all that can be said of any potential relationship between them. This is a case of two women being interested in each other, but the interest is devoid of any actual healthy sexual or romantic content. This phenomenon of queer\u00a0media\u00a0featuring two individuals whose so-called\u00a0\u201clove\u201d\u00a0takes the form of unbridled, dangerous obsession is all too common, and it is disappointing to see it used in such a high quality production. As a queer woman who loves dissecting fictional works, I am very excited to see how Eve and Villanelle\u2019s storyline evolves and eventually culminates, but I am also deeply concerned at how a straight audience will process their unhealthy dynamic, considering the inaccurate idea that lesbianism has its roots in mental instability is already so prevalent.\u00a0</p>",

        "body": "<p>All I knew about this show going in was\nthat Villanelle was supposed to be a psychopath and assassin and then that\nthere was some attraction between her and Eve, and since this is a Literary\nLesbians class I was watching closely for that subtext and how it was portrayed in the show. </p><p> Watching the first two episodes, I definitely\nnoticed Eve\u2019s fixation on Villanelle (or female assassins in general) as being\nborderline obsessive and at least a little gay. \nEven though this fixation gets her in trouble and eventually fired from\nher job, she has no regrets, because she believes this mission is the most\nimportant. \u00a0I feel like Eve has\nencountered similar cases of murder or assassination in this job, because this\nobviously is the only time Eve has been fired from this job, it implies that something\nabout this particular case is special to her. \nAnd apparently it is just her intense interest in female killers. \u00a0The sexual nature of this fascination is also\nimplied when Eve asks her husband if he wants to have sex, and then a few\nseconds later just starts thinking out loud about the case. \u00a0Since Eve\u2019s focus shifts so quickly and\nfluidly from sex to thinking about the female assassin she is tracking, this\nscene demonstrates a clear association between Eve\u2019s thoughts of Villanelle and\nher sexual desire. \u00a0</p><p>Eve\u2019s attraction to Villanelle is made even\nmore clear in her description to the sketch artist. \u00a0She describes Villanelle as having hair the\ncolor of \u201choney,\u201d \u201ccatlike eyes,\u201d and so on. \nEither Eve was extremely entranced by Villanelle\u2019s appearance in the few\nmoments she saw her in the bathroom, or else she has been devoting a lot of\ntime to romanticizing Villanelle in her head after she realized that this nurse\nfrom the bathroom was the killer she had been looking for. \u00a0</p><p>Villanelle also displays a clear\nfascination with Eve even before she finds out that Eve is looking for\nher. \u00a0I think she has a thing for her\nhair, and from her interactions with her bosses when they show her her drawing\nof Eve\u2019s hair, it sounds like someone from her past named Anna may have had\nsimilar hair? \u00a0This is unclear at this\npoint in the show and may be revealed later, but Villanelle\u2019s attraction to Eve\nis still definitely explicit. \u00a0She tells\nthe lady she is hooking up with in a couple scenes to wear Eve\u2019s clothes, she\ncalls her Eve\u2019s name, and she focuses on her hair. \u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m interested to see how Eve deals with\nVillanelle in the next few episodes following Bill\u2019s murder <strike>not to sidetrack from my main point here, but BURY YOUR GAYS\u00a0(OR BIS I GUESS?) MUCH??\u00a0 That death was unneessary imo, and definitely not what he deserved and I\u2019m\nstill MAD.</strike>\u00a0 Eve now says she wants to\nkill Villanelle with her bare hands, but there is still definitely a sexual\ntension between the two of them. \u00a0It\u2019s\ninteresting how much sexual desire and violent desire overlap in this\nsituation. \u00a0Eve says she wants to kill\nEve, but in spite of her psychopathic tendencies and her murder of Bill, her\nattraction is still there mixed in with this desire for revenge. \u00a0Villanelle gives off the vibe that she has\nnever genuinely loved anyone in her life\u2014a vibe which is further strengthened\nafter she promises her ex Nadia that she can trust her now and then runs over\nher multiple times with her car with calm indifference. \u00a0 So\nboth women clearly have this unhealthy obsession with and attraction to each\nother, and I\u2019m not 100% sure how to feel about it. \u00a0On one hand, I love seeing all kinds of\nlesbian characters on-screen. \u00a0I think\nit\u2019s important to have diversity in queer characters and their personalities,\nlikeable and unlikeable, heroic and evil. \nHowever, I worry a little bit that this is falling into the trope of\nlinking attraction between women with psychopathy and being a dangerous or\nunhealthy obsession, rather than something based in trust or love. \u00a0</p><p>So the jury is still out on whether or not\nI support the portrayals of the LGBTQ characters in this show. \u00a0Apart from Bill, who I liked a lot. \u00a0A true icon.
