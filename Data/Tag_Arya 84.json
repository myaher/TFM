How had they managed to get cut off\nwhen Bran had closed the crypst, she did not really know. She just knew that\nbloody Tyrion Lannister had made Jaime and Brienne stop fighting, and her and\nGendry had been pushed somehow by the Unsullied that had fought with them. They\nhad fought with wights and somehow, they had been separated from the others. <i>Pushed or lured. How could I have been that\nstupid?</i> Now, no Unsullied were in sight, although Arya frantically looked\nfor them.</p><!-- more --><p>But cursing\nherself would not help. Gendry swung his big hammer, but everytime they came\nacross a White Walker, it was Arya and her dagger that had to do the work. </p><p>\u201cWe have to\nfind a way out,\u201d Arya called. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>The trap\nwould be sprung any time now, and Arya was thinking fervently about a way to\nleave the castle.</p><p>They ran\ninto a room with a window and Arya shouted at Gendry that he should barricade\nthe door. She could hear steps behind her. She fervently took off the curtains\nfrom the window. She just put a corner of the cloth around the table that stood\nin the room and shoved it to the window, opening the shutters. She climbed on\nthe table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go\nfirst, I\u2019m lighter.\u201d She lowered herself through the window, praying that the\ncurtain would hold. The curtain ended about her height above ground, and she\njumped. Fortunately, the snow was soft. She ran until she had reached what she\njudged to be a safe distance and looked back. Gendry was climbing down, but to\nher horror she saw another figure in frame of the window. She could not see if\nit was a living person or one of the Undead. The man swung over and began\nclimbing down as well. The curtain did not hold and both men fell.</p><p>Arya ran\nback, screaming. It was not a Wight, but one of the Unsullied. He had regained\nhis feet and raised his spear. Gendry was not moving. Arya did not think, what\nto do. She just threw herself against the massive man, and the momentum of her\njump made him stumble at least.</p><p>\u201cGendry\u201d,\nshe shouted, but he did not answer. Arya had stopped the man for the moment,\nbut he was far bigger than her, and he moved forward with his spear.</p><p>Arya could\nhave cried. She was so tired already and her fast descent down the curtain had\nburned her left hand. She switched the dagger to her right, dancing around the\nman. She willed Gendry to open his eyes, but he did not move.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\ndo this? We have to get away, the trap will be sprung any moment now!\u201d, she\nshouted at the man. His answer was unintelligible to her, but his intent was\nclear. </p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to die in a wildfire explosion. </i></p><p>Arya\nthought she saw the three fires on the towers that were the signal. In a\ndesperate attempt to finish the fight she prepared to jump the man and to go\nfor his windpipe. But her foot tangled up in the cursed curtain, and she fell\ninto the snow.</p><p><i>Death by spear it is then. </i>She could have cried.</p><p>She heard a\nscreech. <i>The dragons? </i>She did not\nwant to get up. She did not want to see her own death, but some instinct made\nher straighten up and look what awaited her. She just saw her big opponent\nbeing pierced by another spear, this time a White Walker. He must have come\nafter them. It would only take a second until the man was turned. Arya fumbled\nand threw her dagger, praying to all the gods.</p><p>Her\nvalyrian dagger just grazed the Walker but it was enough. He shattered.</p><p>Arya heard\nscreeches again. Later she could not have said, how she did it, but her last\nreserves were enough to roll Gendry on the rests of the curtain and to half\nroll him half push him away from the castle.</p><p>When the\nwildfire exploded behind her, she threw herself over Gendry with her last\nstrength. The fear and the tension finally overcame her, and blessed darkness\nsurrounded her.</p><p>When she\nopened her eyes again, Gendry had wrapped her in the rests of the curtain and\nheld her to warm her. </p><p>\u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d, she asked.</p><p>\u201cI would\nlike to know as well.\u201d, he answered. He looked battered. His left eye was\nswollen shut and his hands were trembling. Arya took his hands to keep them\nfrom trembling and realised that she was trembling herself.</p><p>Arya told\nhim about the man who had tried to kill him. Her head was spinning, and she\nwondered why. </p><p>\u201cHow long\nhave I been unconscious?\u201d she asked him. It was strange, that she felt safe,\nalthough all around them the castle was burning.</p><p>\u201cI have no\nidea, I was unconscious myself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should\ntry to find someone. I really would like to know, if the plan worked.\u201d</p><p>Gendry\ngestured around them. \u201cThe part about blowing up the castle, certainly did.\u201d</p><p>Arya stood\nup and would have lost her footing when dizziness hit her, if Gendry had not\ncaught her. Arya felt the blood rush in her veins, but the strange spinning of\nher head did not stop.</p><p>She let\nGendry help her walk. Although he had gotten hit on the head, he stood and\nwalked steady. Arya was puzzled about her spinning head. She blamed the\nscreeching dragons. One of them was very faint, and she wondered why.</p><p>\u201cYou saved\nmy life,\u201d Gendry said.</p><p>\u201cI am sure,\nDaenerys gave the order to have you killed. She is going to pay for that, and\nif it is the last thing I do.\u201d The dark anger in her heart was almost enough to\noverwhelm the feeling of the whirlwind in her head.</p><p>They made\ntheir way slowly away from the castle. Gendry held her arm almost tenderly and\nArya wondered how she could feel fatigue, anger, exhaustion, dizziness and\nhappiness at the same time.</p><p><i>Gendry is alive. We survived. We survived.</i></p><p>She smiled\nup at him, and was puzzled, when he suddenly stopped, dread on his face.</p><p>There was a\nclearing ahead of them, and Arya could clearly make out a figure in the snow,\nher red hair spread around her in a halo that caught the early light of the\nmorning. The snow beside her was red.</p><p>It was as\nif all her thoughts fled her and she stood rooted. She placed her feet one\nbefore the other and then she broke into a run, shaking off Gendry\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d<i> Daenerys must have sent someone after her\nas well. How could I have been so stupid.</i></p><p>Olyvar\nstood beside Sansa in a gesture of grief, and Ghost was lying on the ground in\na strange angle.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u201d,\nArya cried again. Her sister\u2019s face was pale.</p><p>She knelt\nbeside her and gathered her sister in his arms, tears streaming down her\ncheeks.</p><p>She almost\nlet her fall, when she heard Sansa whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\na show Arya, I\u2019m fine, but please continue to play along.\u201d</p><p>Arya felt\ndizzy again, but she did as Sansa told her, until she heard Olyvar speak. </p><p>\u201cShe flew\nto the godswood, just like Lord Bran said.\u201d</p><p>Arya looked\nup and directly into Gendry\u2019s eyes. Olyvar had placed a hand on Gendry\u2019s arm to\nhold him back.</p><p>Sansa stood\nup and Gendry gasped. Ghost miraculously jumped up as well, came over and\ncircled them, his tongue lolling. Arya laughed and dried her tears.</p><p>\u201cGhost,\u201d\nshe said.</p><p>\u201cGhost is a\ntalented actor.\u201d, Sansa told her. \u201cGhost, be a good boy. Play dead.\u201d</p><p>Ghost\ndropped and came to lie in the strange angle Arya had seen before.</p><p>Arya\nlaughed again until Sansa boxed her in her side.</p><p>\u201cShht.\u201d,\nshe said. \u201cYou\u2019ll blow our story if you laugh to loud. Bran insisted that Daenerys\nneeds to think that she has won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really\ngave me the fright of my life.\u201d Arya shook her head. \u201cWhy did Bran not tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came up\nwith the scheme on a whim when Olyvar told me that Daenerys had tried to bribe\nhim to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nsmiled. \u201cAnd you are supposed to be down in the crypts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was\na lot of confusion.\u201d Arya told her. She rushed in her sister\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cOh gods,\nis it over now? Is it finally over?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hope\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink so,\u201d Olyvar interrupted them. He pointed at the godswood. They saw\nDrogon, a huge flame, the weirwood catching fire fast, and then the dragon\nfell. </p><p>It felt\nlike the word was going to end. The impact drove them all to their knees.</p>",

They\nhad fought with wights and somehow, they had been separated from the others. <i>Pushed or lured. How could I have been that\nstupid?</i> Now, no Unsullied were in sight, although Arya frantically looked\nfor them.</p>[[MORE]]<p>But cursing\nherself would not help. Gendry swung his big hammer, but everytime they came\nacross a White Walker, it was Arya and her dagger that had to do the work. </p><p>\u201cWe have to\nfind a way out,\u201d Arya called. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>The trap\nwould be sprung any time now, and Arya was thinking fervently about a way to\nleave the castle.</p><p>They ran\ninto a room with a window and Arya shouted at Gendry that he should barricade\nthe door. She could hear steps behind her. She fervently took off the curtains\nfrom the window. She just put a corner of the cloth around the table that stood\nin the room and shoved it to the window, opening the shutters. She climbed on\nthe table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go\nfirst, I\u2019m lighter.\u201d She lowered herself through the window, praying that the\ncurtain would hold. The curtain ended about her height above ground, and she\njumped. Fortunately, the snow was soft. She ran until she had reached what she\njudged to be a safe distance and looked back. Gendry was climbing down, but to\nher horror she saw another figure in frame of the window. She could not see if\nit was a living person or one of the Undead. The man swung over and began\nclimbing down as well. The curtain did not hold and both men fell.</p><p>Arya ran\nback, screaming. It was not a Wight, but one of the Unsullied. He had regained\nhis feet and raised his spear. Gendry was not moving. Arya did not think, what\nto do. She just threw herself against the massive man, and the momentum of her\njump made him stumble at least.</p><p>\u201cGendry\u201d,\nshe shouted, but he did not answer. Arya had stopped the man for the moment,\nbut he was far bigger than her, and he moved forward with his spear.</p><p>Arya could\nhave cried. She was so tired already and her fast descent down the curtain had\nburned her left hand. She switched the dagger to her right, dancing around the\nman. She willed Gendry to open his eyes, but he did not move.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\ndo this? We have to get away, the trap will be sprung any moment now!\u201d, she\nshouted at the man. His answer was unintelligible to her, but his intent was\nclear. </p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to die in a wildfire explosion. </i></p><p>Arya\nthought she saw the three fires on the towers that were the signal. In a\ndesperate attempt to finish the fight she prepared to jump the man and to go\nfor his windpipe. But her foot tangled up in the cursed curtain, and she fell\ninto the snow.</p><p><i>Death by spear it is then. </i>She could have cried.</p><p>She heard a\nscreech. <i>The dragons? </i>She did not\nwant to get up. She did not want to see her own death, but some instinct made\nher straighten up and look what awaited her. She just saw her big opponent\nbeing pierced by another spear, this time a White Walker. He must have come\nafter them. It would only take a second until the man was turned. Arya fumbled\nand threw her dagger, praying to all the gods.</p><p>Her\nvalyrian dagger just grazed the Walker but it was enough. He shattered.</p><p>Arya heard\nscreeches again. Later she could not have said, how she did it, but her last\nreserves were enough to roll Gendry on the rests of the curtain and to half\nroll him half push him away from the castle.</p><p>When the\nwildfire exploded behind her, she threw herself over Gendry with her last\nstrength. The fear and the tension finally overcame her, and blessed darkness\nsurrounded her.</p><p>When she\nopened her eyes again, Gendry had wrapped her in the rests of the curtain and\nheld her to warm her. </p><p>\u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d, she asked.</p><p>\u201cI would\nlike to know as well.\u201d, he answered. He looked battered. His left eye was\nswollen shut and his hands were trembling. Arya took his hands to keep them\nfrom trembling and realised that she was trembling herself.</p><p>Arya told\nhim about the man who had tried to kill him. Her head was spinning, and she\nwondered why. </p><p>\u201cHow long\nhave I been unconscious?\u201d she asked him. It was strange, that she felt safe,\nalthough all around them the castle was burning.</p><p>\u201cI have no\nidea, I was unconscious myself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should\ntry to find someone. I really would like to know, if the plan worked.\u201d</p><p>Gendry\ngestured around them. \u201cThe part about blowing up the castle, certainly did.\u201d</p><p>Arya stood\nup and would have lost her footing when dizziness hit her, if Gendry had not\ncaught her. Arya felt the blood rush in her veins, but the strange spinning of\nher head did not stop.</p><p>She let\nGendry help her walk. Although he had gotten hit on the head, he stood and\nwalked steady. Arya was puzzled about her spinning head. She blamed the\nscreeching dragons. One of them was very faint, and she wondered why.</p><p>\u201cYou saved\nmy life,\u201d Gendry said.</p><p>\u201cI am sure,\nDaenerys gave the order to have you killed. She is going to pay for that, and\nif it is the last thing I do.\u201d The dark anger in her heart was almost enough to\noverwhelm the feeling of the whirlwind in her head.</p><p>They made\ntheir way slowly away from the castle. Gendry held her arm almost tenderly and\nArya wondered how she could feel fatigue, anger, exhaustion, dizziness and\nhappiness at the same time.</p><p><i>Gendry is alive. We survived. We survived.</i></p><p>She smiled\nup at him, and was puzzled, when he suddenly stopped, dread on his face.</p><p>There was a\nclearing ahead of them, and Arya could clearly make out a figure in the snow,\nher red hair spread around her in a halo that caught the early light of the\nmorning. The snow beside her was red.</p><p>It was as\nif all her thoughts fled her and she stood rooted. She placed her feet one\nbefore the other and then she broke into a run, shaking off Gendry\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d<i> Daenerys must have sent someone after her\nas well.
