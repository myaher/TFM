She keeps getting better at lying and she\u2019s currently relying on her fake identity to survive. But just because she says lies that doesn\u2019t necessary means that she likes it. I believe that soon will come a time where she will have to choose between continuing the easy road of lying or following the hard path of truth. I\u2019m rooting for the second. After all, Sansa never wanted to play the game of thrones herself. </p><p>I can see why you picked that struggle for Arya but for me her major one is choosing between being alone (and No One) and being part of the pack (and a Stark). Ned\u2019s famous quote about the lone wolf dying and \u00a0the pack surviving keeps reappearing on some crucial scenes in her point of view for a reason. I think it\u2019s because so far Arya has achieved more things while being alone while tragedy has befallen to her family members who weren\u2019t alone (Catelyn and Robb, Bran and Rickon). But this quote coming from a person she really respected (her father) is a reminder that maybe on the darkest days to come will be better to be part of the pack instead of being alone. </p><p>Moving on to Jon, I think his major struggle is between doing his duty and doing what he believes it\u2019s the right thing. Jon always wanted to appear a dutiful person and not to be associated with the bastard\u2019s stigma (aka the bastard\u2019s honor). However, he also has a strong sense of justice that often conflicts with his duty. This is evident on the fifth book where that struggle of his takes central place and in the end it\u2019s partly the reason why he got killed.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys most struggles come from her queedom. Daenerys doesn\u2019t have an older relative or a mentor to help her navigate the path of a leader and often questions her actions as the Queen. The major struggle being torn between being a merciful queen and a successful one. It comes natural to her to help others since she has been through so much all her life. That often comes in conflict with her wanting to follow the steps of her successful ancestors. The dragons plant to trees is a quote that shows exactly this. Thankfully Daenerys isn\u2019t only a dragon but a Mhysa as well.\u00a0</p><p>I admit that I\u2019m not sure about the major struggle of Bran and Tyruon(if they have a single major conflict at all). However I\u2019ll give it a try.\u00a0</p><p>Bran : so far his major inner struggle is about whether he should continue using Hodor\u2019s body for his own means. Bran\u2019s young age pretends us from seeing his actions in such a bad light as we would do if he was older. However, ripping someone off his free will is not a morally good action and I believe that Bran will come to realize it on the last two books.</p><p>\u00a0Tyrion : I think his major struggle is choosing whether he will lived hunted by his past ghosts or learning from the past. He\u2019s a character who has faced many hardships in his life and for a lot of shit he\u2019s going through his family is to blame. On the fifth book, he was at his lowest \u201cdefeated\u201d by the past ghosts and having little hope for the future. But at some point on the future books he\u2019ll have to decide whether he\u2019ll let everything that happened in the past bring him down or if he\u2019ll take a brave step forward, not forgetting his past but also no letting it define him.</p>",

I figured that if I am going to be sitting here doing nothing I might as well be doing something slightly productive. From here on I am going to try and write my thoughts on the show(s) I am currently watching. So !!SPOILER!! Hope you enjoy my mindless rambling and keep reading.",

Bran is a main character despite all the butchering of his personality and importance. There\u2019s no way they are going to marry him to a character who\u2019s already married to someone else in the books. That\u2019s a huge disservice to his character.

Bran is a main character despite all the butchering of his personality and importance. There\u2019s no way they are going to marry him to a character who\u2019s already married to someone else in the books. That\u2019s a huge disservice to his character. I refuse to believe that they\u2019ll do that. Urgh they might actually do that. We\u2019ll have to wait for ADoS to learn who GRRM intends to pair Bran with.\u00a0</p>",
