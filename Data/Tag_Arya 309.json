        "body": "<h1>Lady Stoneheart and Arya Theory???</h1><p>So I know a lot of people seem to think that Arya will end up in the Riverlands again so she can claim her pack (Nymeria &amp; her little grey cousins) and so she can kill Lady Stoneheart, but I disagree. I don&rsquo;t think Arya will end Lady Stoneheart, at least not in the Riverlands and not just after returning to Westeros. In fact, I don&rsquo;t think she will run into the BWB while in the Riverlands. I think Arya will reclaim her relationship with Nymeria and possibly see some other old faces, but not the ones you would expect. </p><p>As for Lady Stoneheart, she will most likely make her way up North. Either because of the rumors about Arya, Stannis being up there in Winterfell &amp; being a kin slayer(Undead!Cat is killing peeps she considers &lsquo;no bueno&rsquo;), Jon having gotten some sort of position of power in Winterfell (Catelyn wouldn&rsquo;t be happy about that), cause she heard of Sansa being alive, or cause Thoros will convince her to head that way similar to the show (unlikely but a possibility). The Arya, Stannis, and Jon reasons are the most likely, in my opinion. I think she&rsquo;ll already be headed North by the time Sansa heads there too. Plus, I don&rsquo;t trust anything the show has to say so the Thoros one is less likely to me.</p><p>And while she&rsquo;s up North, I think she&rsquo;s going to have a very important role to play, which is the main reason I don&rsquo;t think she will die in the Riverlands. What I mean pertains to the way she was brought back to life, the very literal 'Kiss of Life&rsquo;. As far as we know being brought back isn&rsquo;t something that widespread amongst the followers of the faith of the Lord of Light. If it was, more people would be converted and using it to try and bring their dead back. Furthermore, if Stoneheart was just meant to be a foil for the Frey&rsquo;s &amp; Brienne/ a stepping stone for Arya, then why give her such a unique way of being brought back? I&rsquo;ll tell you why! It&rsquo;s cause George is planning on using it later on. George has even stated that he thinks one of the double douches&rsquo; biggest mistakes is not bringing in Stoneheart (ie~ she&rsquo;s vital to the story). Why say that if she&rsquo;s just going to be killed by Arya??? No, she&rsquo;s going to use the kiss to bring back someone else, who may or may not use it on someone else in return [possibly jon being brought back  for a second time or the first( I only think this one because of how long cat had been dead when she was brought back vs beric &amp; jon is at the wall where he won&rsquo;t decompose any time soon) and then jon using this to bring back another maybe\ud83e\udd14(I have thoughts about this but I won&rsquo;t get into that right now)]. Either way, George isn&rsquo;t the type to introduce such a big game changer and then not use it. </p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the whole Brienne plotline, which is currently tied to Stoneheart and the BWB the last time we read anything about them. Brienne is likely going to pass on some kind of info relevant to Stoneheart &amp;/or be given a second chance with a new mission of sorts.

            "comment": "<p><h1>Lady Stoneheart and Arya Theory???</h1><p>So I know a lot of people seem to think that Arya will end up in the Riverlands again so she can claim her pack (Nymeria &amp; her little grey cousins) and so she can kill Lady Stoneheart, but I disagree. I don\u2019t think Arya will end Lady Stoneheart, at least not in the Riverlands and not just after returning to Westeros. In fact, I don\u2019t think she will run into the BWB while in the Riverlands. I think Arya will reclaim her relationship with Nymeria and possibly see some other old faces, but not the ones you would expect. </p><p>As for Lady Stoneheart, she will most likely make her way up North. Either because of the rumors about Arya, Stannis being up there in Winterfell &amp; being a kin slayer(Undead!Cat is killing peeps she considers \u2018no bueno\u2019), Jon having gotten some sort of position of power in Winterfell (Catelyn wouldn\u2019t be happy about that), cause she heard of Sansa being alive, or cause Thoros will convince her to head that way similar to the show (unlikely but a possibility). The Arya, Stannis, and Jon reasons are the most likely, in my opinion. I think she\u2019ll already be headed North by the time Sansa heads there too. Plus, I don\u2019t trust anything the show has to say so the Thoros one is less likely to me.</p><p>And while she\u2019s up North, I think she\u2019s going to have a very important role to play, which is the main reason I don\u2019t think she will die in the Riverlands. What I mean pertains to the way she was brought back to life, the very literal 'Kiss of Life\u2019. As far as we know being brought back isn\u2019t something that widespread amongst the followers of the faith of the Lord of Light. If it was, more people would be converted and using it to try and bring their dead back. Furthermore, if Stoneheart was just meant to be a foil for the Frey\u2019s &amp; Brienne/ a stepping stone for Arya, then why give her such a unique way of being brought back? I\u2019ll tell you why! It\u2019s cause George is planning on using it later on. George has even stated that he thinks one of the double douches\u2019 biggest mistakes is not bringing in Stoneheart (ie~ she\u2019s vital to the story). Why say that if she\u2019s just going to be killed by Arya??? No, she\u2019s going to use the kiss to bring back someone else, who may or may not use it on someone else in return [possibly jon being brought back  for a second time or the first( I only think this one because of how long cat had been dead when she was brought back vs beric &amp; jon is at the wall where he won\u2019t decompose any time soon) and then jon using this to bring back another maybe\ud83e\udd14(I have thoughts about this but I won\u2019t get into that right now)].
