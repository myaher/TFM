But I wouldn\u2019t put it past them.</p><p>Also, if I\u2019m asking for stuff, can Sansa realise how great he is and give him another shot? Thanks.</p><p>2.

I was persuaded to post this earlier, not that it took a lot. Hope you guys enjoy!</p><p><i>This part has descriptions of torture throughout its entirety. If that makes yo uncomfortable\u00a0please skip this story.\u00a0</i></p><!-- more --><p><i>Her eyes settled to the far corner of the room, a strangled whisper making past her lips. \u201cPeter..\u201d</i></p><p>Her heart stopped and her chest constricted painfully. Peter sat in the far corner of the room they had taken her to. His hands were chained behind him and to the wall, and his legs were curled up into his body as he tried to shield himself from the horror. He heard her faint whisper as it barely made it across the room, and he looked to her with a look of pure unadulterated fear in his eyes. </p><p>The pairs of hands that had been dragging her around unceremoniously threw her onto the ground, She hit the floor with a thud, pain from her knees and elbows shot through her from the impact. She turned to look back at the men that threw her, her eyes meeting the eyes of several hydra scientists. When she noticed what she was sitting next to, she had to use everything in her not to lose to contents of her stomach. \u00a0</p><p>Beside her was the reason Bucky had his nightmares. The reason why he struggled to remember his past life, why he spent more nights beating a punching bag until he was so physically exhausted that he passed out, than sleeping in his bed. The machine crackled with the electricity flowing through it, and sparks came off the the panels attached to what she assumed was the piece for the person\u2019s head.</p><p>Short, bated breaths sounded from behind her and she whipped around to Peter still curled into himself. A large purple bruise showed itself on his cheek, and (y/n) felt a primal instinct in her take over. It was the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back, and she snapped. She stood quickly and lunged at the nearest scientist. Her hands latched onto his neck and she gave a quick turn easily snapping his neck with a satisfying crack. He slumped to the ground, and she turned to the next one ready to off him as well. Just as she lunged, she felt a strong grip yank her back and another small pinch at the base of her neck. </p><p>Slowly she lost her ability to keep herself standing. It was the same stuff as before, and she slumped to the ground just like the scientist before. Sounds again became muffled but she could hear a drowned out scream from Peter. She slowly turned her head, using every bit of effort she had left, to see him thrashing against his restraints, tears flowing down his cheeks in earnest. It hurt her in every way possible to see how pained he was, and she knew what was about to happen. It broke her heart to know he had to watch it, she didn\u2019t care about what was about to happen to her. </p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight it, they made sure of that by injecting with whatever concoction they mixed together. One of the big men standing in corner moved over to her and picked her up, forcefully slamming her into the chair. She felt the cold buckles of the arm and leg restraints, but she didn\u2019t quite register them as such. One of the scientists approached her carefully, holding the mouth guard in between his fingers. Another scientist said something to him that (y/n) couldn\u2019t hear but it seemed to reassure him and give him he confidence to roughly shove the mouth guard into her mouth. She could hear the muffled cries of Peter, most likely still thrashing against the chains. </p><p>All she wanted to do was a reassure him that everything would be okay as long as they didn\u2019t hurt him. She tried to speak, to tell them they could hurt her all they wanted but they didn\u2019t need to lay a hand on him, but she couldn\u2019t make the sound, it just got stuck in her throat and she just let out a strangled gasp as the headpiece of the machine came down over her face and eyes. They flicked a switch, and any protests she attempted to make were stolen from her as her body arched and writhed in pain from the amount of electricity that now flowed through her. </p><p>She couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it, and she let out a blood curdling scream. It felt like she was being torn in half, searing heat whipped through her veins and seized any coherent thought. She could see the brightness push through her brain, and she felt all of her memories pulled away from her grasp. She fought hard against it, tugging back her memories. She finally used everything piece of strength she had and pulled them back to her. As she did, the pain slowed until it was gone. The machine turned off, but its affects still lingered, she didn\u2019t know if she could do it again. Her body collapsed back onto the chair and relaxed back into its previous state of paralysis. </p><p>Nobody said a word after, if they did there was no way she would\u2019ve heard it, her ears rung so loud she was sure it was audible for everyone in the room. A nod was exchanged between two scientists and one made his way back to the switch and without hesitating flipped back on. Like her body was pulled by a magnet, her back arched and she let out another bone chilling scream. She could feel the heat of the electricity making its way back to her brain. It was almost as if it had a mind of its own, it moved through her until it pulled her most cherished memories to the front, she fought against it but with each passing second she lost more and more strength.</p><p>She watched in horror as memories were torn from her with no mercy.\u00a0</p><p>The first to go was the day she\u2019d become an avenger. She had walked out of the elevator at the tower to all eyes on her, she gave a small wave and immediately everyone rushed over to ask her questions and introduce themselves. She had known right then and there these people would be her family. Steve tried to be the gentleman and introduce himself but was quickly pushed out of the way by Sam, who was just dying to know what her abilities were. Eventually all the excitement had died down and Steve and Bucky offered to show her to her room, one that was in between their own. </p><p>The second to go was first time she had ever beaten Steve in a sparring session. She had been practicing for months, constantly studying his fight patterns, doing extra training with Nat to learn her best moves. She had been so excited and as sad as he was that he\u2019d been defeated, Steve offered to cook her dinner to celebrate. It was his ma\u2019s recipe for spaghetti. The first bite she\u2019d had, she nearly let out a very inappropriate moan. Since then Steve had promised to make it for her for special occasions, like her birthday or if she ever beat Bucky in a sparring match. </p><p>She fought so hard to keep the memory of the first time she had realized that Peter was Spider-man. She had almost walked into a busy street so lost in her thoughts, and had almost been hit by a car, when Peter had swooped down and picked her up. Her dropped her off on top of a building and said that she needed to be more safe. Her eyes grew wide as she recognized the voice and The eyes on the mask went wide as well, Peter realizing he\u2019d screwed up. He should\u2019ve known that she\u2019d recognize his voice, they only spent hours upon hours together. \u201cPeter? Is that you?\u201d She questioned running her hands down her jacket and pants to straighten them out. He left out a long breath and noticeably deflated before he answered. \u201cYeah it is\u2026\u201d He reaches behind his head and pulled of the mask. He expected her to be mad that he hadn\u2019t told her but instead she told him that it was amazing, and that now somethings made a lot more sense. They both had a chuckle about the whole thing and dropped back down to the sidewalk and headed back towards the tower. </p><p>Not all of the memories were the good memories, some were painful. The fourth memory she watched disappear from her was the first time she had stopped one of Bucky\u2019s nightmares and subsequent panic attack. He\u2019d held onto her so tightly she was sure she was going to suffocate but she didn\u2019t care. She had only wanted him to know he was safe and that nothing bad was going to happen. She\u2019d spent the rest of the night holding onto him as he slept. He never let go of her, though he did loosen his grip as he started to relax. </p><p>Her fingers dug into her palm drawing blood as memory after memory was torn from her. Each one more painful than the last. It was a physical pain, each memory felt like they were ripping apart of her away, like someone was yanking on her limbs trying to pull them from her. <br/>&mdash;-</p><p>Peter screamed for her as she continued to writhe from the pain. The scientists had muttered something about her being stronger than most and this time they needed to let the machine run longer. He tried to yell at them and tell they needed to stop but just received a backhand across his face, leaving a bruise to quickly form on his cheek. He struggled to listen to her screams and know that there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. Through his tears, Peter prayed for this to be over, for someone to come bursting through the doors and save them, stopping their current hell. \u201cPlease, please stop this.\u201d He whispered, his voice shaking with fear. </p><p>They finally switched the machine off, and Peter watched her body sag back onto the chair. Her chest heaved as she tried to regain her breathing but it was clear she struggled. Each breath felt like there was a fire that licked at her lungs, combined with a heavy weight on her chest. The headpiece lifted from her face, and Peter gasped as he saw what it had done to her. Her nose bled heavily, her eyes were bloodshot and she had tears wetting her cheeks, below her right eye was a deep purple bruise from where the machine had been placed. She has a matching one below her eye and above her brow on her left side, the bruise even darker. Her hands were covered in blood from how hard she had been balling her hands into fists. One of the men rushed up to her to grab the mouth guard. He rolled his eyes and delivered a painful slap to her cheek just as he had done with Peter, when as he took it out, (y/n) turned and spit out the blood that had pooled in her mouth. </p><p>Her hearing had come back after the last round, and she fought to keep the rising bile down when he muttered, \u201cLet\u2019s go another round. She clearly isn\u2019t ready yet.\u201d He walked back to his place behind the large console that held the switch for the machine, another scientist put the guard back into her mouth and smirked at her. Behind the console they flipped the switch once more and sent (y/n) howling out in pain. </p><p>It felt like the air had been ripped from her lungs, it felt like someone sat on her chest and put a hand around her throat crushing her only way to breath. She gasped and yanked against the restraints, trying to get away from the pain but it just keep going on and on. In her struggle and failure to get away, she missed the banging of the door opening and every agent dropping with a single bullet to the head. There was no hesitation in the soldier\u2019s choice to down every agent, he didn\u2019t want to put up a fight with people who hurt those he cared about.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b0e3266e5fc0fc97d9fabbb3ce0a04b/tumblr_inline_phoytrqmq91ticqtz_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><h2>If you liked this, let me know!Leave a like and a reblog.

If that makes yo uncomfortable\u00a0please skip this story.\u00a0</i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Her eyes settled to the far corner of the room, a strangled whisper making past her lips. \u201cPeter..\u201d</i></p><p>Her heart stopped and her chest constricted painfully. Peter sat in the far corner of the room they had taken her to. His hands were chained behind him and to the wall, and his legs were curled up into his body as he tried to shield himself from the horror. He heard her faint whisper as it barely made it across the room, and he looked to her with a look of pure unadulterated fear in his eyes. </p><p>The pairs of hands that had been dragging her around unceremoniously threw her onto the ground, She hit the floor with a thud, pain from her knees and elbows shot through her from the impact. She turned to look back at the men that threw her, her eyes meeting the eyes of several hydra scientists. When she noticed what she was sitting next to, she had to use everything in her not to lose to contents of her stomach. \u00a0</p><p>Beside her was the reason Bucky had his nightmares. The reason why he struggled to remember his past life, why he spent more nights beating a punching bag until he was so physically exhausted that he passed out, than sleeping in his bed. The machine crackled with the electricity flowing through it, and sparks came off the the panels attached to what she assumed was the piece for the person\u2019s head.</p><p>Short, bated breaths sounded from behind her and she whipped around to Peter still curled into himself. A large purple bruise showed itself on his cheek, and (y/n) felt a primal instinct in her take over. It was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, and she snapped. She stood quickly and lunged at the nearest scientist. Her hands latched onto his neck and she gave a quick turn easily snapping his neck with a satisfying crack. He slumped to the ground, and she turned to the next one ready to off him as well. Just as she lunged, she felt a strong grip yank her back and another small pinch at the base of her neck. </p><p>Slowly she lost her ability to keep herself standing. It was the same stuff as before, and she slumped to the ground just like the scientist before. Sounds again became muffled but she could hear a drowned out scream from Peter. She slowly turned her head, using every bit of effort she had left, to see him thrashing against his restraints, tears flowing down his cheeks in earnest. It hurt her in every way possible to see how pained he was, and she knew what was about to happen. It broke her heart to know he had to watch it, she didn\u2019t care about what was about to happen to her. </p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight it, they made sure of that by injecting with whatever concoction they mixed together. One of the big men standing in corner moved over to her and picked her up, forcefully slamming her into the chair. She felt the cold buckles of the arm and leg restraints, but she didn\u2019t quite register them as such. One of the scientists approached her carefully, holding the mouth guard in between his fingers. Another scientist said something to him that (y/n) couldn\u2019t hear but it seemed to reassure him and give him he confidence to roughly shove the mouth guard into her mouth. She could hear the muffled cries of Peter, most likely still thrashing against the chains. </p><p>All she wanted to do was a reassure him that everything would be okay as long as they didn\u2019t hurt him. She tried to speak, to tell them they could hurt her all they wanted but they didn\u2019t need to lay a hand on him, but she couldn\u2019t make the sound, it just got stuck in her throat and she just let out a strangled gasp as the headpiece of the machine came down over her face and eyes. They flicked a switch, and any protests she attempted to make were stolen from her as her body arched and writhed in pain from the amount of electricity that now flowed through her. </p><p>She couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it, and she let out a blood curdling scream. It felt like she was being torn in half, searing heat whipped through her veins and seized any coherent thought. She could see the brightness push through her brain, and she felt all of her memories pulled away from her grasp. She fought hard against it, tugging back her memories. She finally used everything piece of strength she had and pulled them back to her. As she did, the pain slowed until it was gone. The machine turned off, but its affects still lingered, she didn\u2019t know if she could do it again. Her body collapsed back onto the chair and relaxed back into its previous state of paralysis. </p><p>Nobody said a word after, if they did there was no way she would\u2019ve heard it, her ears rung so loud she was sure it was audible for everyone in the room. A nod was exchanged between two scientists and one made his way back to the switch and without hesitating flipped back on. Like her body was pulled by a magnet, her back arched and she let out another bone chilling scream. She could feel the heat of the electricity making its way back to her brain. It was almost as if it had a mind of its own, it moved through her until it pulled her most cherished memories to the front, she fought against it but with each passing second she lost more and more strength.</p><p>She watched in horror as memories were torn from her with no mercy.\u00a0</p><p>The first to go was the day she\u2019d become an avenger. She had walked out of the elevator at the tower to all eyes on her, she gave a small wave and immediately everyone rushed over to ask her questions and introduce themselves. She had known right then and there these people would be her family. Steve tried to be the gentleman and introduce himself but was quickly pushed out of the way by Sam, who was just dying to know what her abilities were. Eventually all the excitement had died down and Steve and Bucky offered to show her to her room, one that was in between their own. </p><p>The second to go was first time she had ever beaten Steve in a sparring session. She had been practicing for months, constantly studying his fight patterns, doing extra training with Nat to learn her best moves. She had been so excited and as sad as he was that he\u2019d been defeated, Steve offered to cook her dinner to celebrate. It was his ma\u2019s recipe for spaghetti. The first bite she\u2019d had, she nearly let out a very inappropriate moan. Since then Steve had promised to make it for her for special occasions, like her birthday or if she ever beat Bucky in a sparring match. </p><p>She fought so hard to keep the memory of the first time she had realized that Peter was Spider-man. She had almost walked into a busy street so lost in her thoughts, and had almost been hit by a car, when Peter had swooped down and picked her up. Her dropped her off on top of a building and said that she needed to be more safe. Her eyes grew wide as she recognized the voice and The eyes on the mask went wide as well, Peter realizing he\u2019d screwed up. He should\u2019ve known that she\u2019d recognize his voice, they only spent hours upon hours together. \u201cPeter? Is that you?\u201d She questioned running her hands down her jacket and pants to straighten them out. He left out a long breath and noticeably deflated before he answered. \u201cYeah it is\u2026\u201d He reaches behind his head and pulled of the mask. He expected her to be mad that he hadn\u2019t told her but instead she told him that it was amazing, and that now somethings made a lot more sense. They both had a chuckle about the whole thing and dropped back down to the sidewalk and headed back towards the tower. </p><p>Not all of the memories were the good memories, some were painful.

Peter sat in the far corner of the room they had taken her to. His hands were chained behind him and to the wall, and his legs were curled up into his body as he tried to shield himself from the horror. He heard her faint whisper as it barely made it across the room, and he looked to her with a look of pure unadulterated fear in his eyes. </p><p>The pairs of hands that had been dragging her around unceremoniously threw her onto the ground, She hit the floor with a thud, pain from her knees and elbows shot through her from the impact. She turned to look back at the men that threw her, her eyes meeting the eyes of several hydra scientists. When she noticed what she was sitting next to, she had to use everything in her not to lose to contents of her stomach. \u00a0</p><p>Beside her was the reason Bucky had his nightmares. The reason why he struggled to remember his past life, why he spent more nights beating a punching bag until he was so physically exhausted that he passed out, than sleeping in his bed. The machine crackled with the electricity flowing through it, and sparks came off the the panels attached to what she assumed was the piece for the person\u2019s head.</p><p>Short, bated breaths sounded from behind her and she whipped around to Peter still curled into himself. A large purple bruise showed itself on his cheek, and (y/n) felt a primal instinct in her take over. It was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, and she snapped. She stood quickly and lunged at the nearest scientist. Her hands latched onto his neck and she gave a quick turn easily snapping his neck with a satisfying crack. He slumped to the ground, and she turned to the next one ready to off him as well. Just as she lunged, she felt a strong grip yank her back and another small pinch at the base of her neck. </p><p>Slowly she lost her ability to keep herself standing. It was the same stuff as before, and she slumped to the ground just like the scientist before. Sounds again became muffled but she could hear a drowned out scream from Peter. She slowly turned her head, using every bit of effort she had left, to see him thrashing against his restraints, tears flowing down his cheeks in earnest. It hurt her in every way possible to see how pained he was, and she knew what was about to happen. It broke her heart to know he had to watch it, she didn\u2019t care about what was about to happen to her. </p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight it, they made sure of that by injecting with whatever concoction they mixed together. One of the big men standing in corner moved over to her and picked her up, forcefully slamming her into the chair. She felt the cold buckles of the arm and leg restraints, but she didn\u2019t quite register them as such. One of the scientists approached her carefully, holding the mouth guard in between his fingers. Another scientist said something to him that (y/n) couldn\u2019t hear but it seemed to reassure him and give him he confidence to roughly shove the mouth guard into her mouth. She could hear the muffled cries of Peter, most likely still thrashing against the chains. </p><p>All she wanted to do was a reassure him that everything would be okay as long as they didn\u2019t hurt him. She tried to speak, to tell them they could hurt her all they wanted but they didn\u2019t need to lay a hand on him, but she couldn\u2019t make the sound, it just got stuck in her throat and she just let out a strangled gasp as the headpiece of the machine came down over her face and eyes. They flicked a switch, and any protests she attempted to make were stolen from her as her body arched and writhed in pain from the amount of electricity that now flowed through her. </p><p>She couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it, and she let out a blood curdling scream. It felt like she was being torn in half, searing heat whipped through her veins and seized any coherent thought. She could see the brightness push through her brain, and she felt all of her memories pulled away from her grasp. She fought hard against it, tugging back her memories. She finally used everything piece of strength she had and pulled them back to her. As she did, the pain slowed until it was gone. The machine turned off, but its affects still lingered, she didn\u2019t know if she could do it again. Her body collapsed back onto the chair and relaxed back into its previous state of paralysis. </p><p>Nobody said a word after, if they did there was no way she would\u2019ve heard it, her ears rung so loud she was sure it was audible for everyone in the room. A nod was exchanged between two scientists and one made his way back to the switch and without hesitating flipped back on. Like her body was pulled by a magnet, her back arched and she let out another bone chilling scream. She could feel the heat of the electricity making its way back to her brain. It was almost as if it had a mind of its own, it moved through her until it pulled her most cherished memories to the front, she fought against it but with each passing second she lost more and more strength.</p><p>She watched in horror as memories were torn from her with no mercy.\u00a0</p><p>The first to go was the day she\u2019d become an avenger. She had walked out of the elevator at the tower to all eyes on her, she gave a small wave and immediately everyone rushed over to ask her questions and introduce themselves. She had known right then and there these people would be her family. Steve tried to be the gentleman and introduce himself but was quickly pushed out of the way by Sam, who was just dying to know what her abilities were. Eventually all the excitement had died down and Steve and Bucky offered to show her to her room, one that was in between their own. </p><p>The second to go was first time she had ever beaten Steve in a sparring session. She had been practicing for months, constantly studying his fight patterns, doing extra training with Nat to learn her best moves. She had been so excited and as sad as he was that he\u2019d been defeated, Steve offered to cook her dinner to celebrate. It was his ma\u2019s recipe for spaghetti. The first bite she\u2019d had, she nearly let out a very inappropriate moan. Since then Steve had promised to make it for her for special occasions, like her birthday or if she ever beat Bucky in a sparring match. </p><p>She fought so hard to keep the memory of the first time she had realized that Peter was Spider-man. She had almost walked into a busy street so lost in her thoughts, and had almost been hit by a car, when Peter had swooped down and picked her up. Her dropped her off on top of a building and said that she needed to be more safe. Her eyes grew wide as she recognized the voice and The eyes on the mask went wide as well, Peter realizing he\u2019d screwed up. He should\u2019ve known that she\u2019d recognize his voice, they only spent hours upon hours together. \u201cPeter? Is that you?\u201d She questioned running her hands down her jacket and pants to straighten them out. He left out a long breath and noticeably deflated before he answered. \u201cYeah it is\u2026\u201d He reaches behind his head and pulled of the mask. He expected her to be mad that he hadn\u2019t told her but instead she told him that it was amazing, and that now somethings made a lot more sense. They both had a chuckle about the whole thing and dropped back down to the sidewalk and headed back towards the tower. </p><p>Not all of the memories were the good memories, some were painful. The fourth memory she watched disappear from her was the first time she had stopped one of Bucky\u2019s nightmares and subsequent panic attack. He\u2019d held onto her so tightly she was sure she was going to suffocate but she didn\u2019t care. She had only wanted him to know he was safe and that nothing bad was going to happen. She\u2019d spent the rest of the night holding onto him as he slept. He never let go of her, though he did loosen his grip as he started to relax. </p><p>Her fingers dug into her palm drawing blood as memory after memory was torn from her. Each one more painful than the last. It was a physical pain, each memory felt like they were ripping apart of her away, like someone was yanking on her limbs trying to pull them from her. <br>\u2014-</p><p>Peter screamed for her as she continued to writhe from the pain. The scientists had muttered something about her being stronger than most and this time they needed to let the machine run longer. He tried to yell at them and tell they needed to stop but just received a backhand across his face, leaving a bruise to quickly form on his cheek. He struggled to listen to her screams and know that there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. Through his tears, Peter prayed for this to be over, for someone to come bursting through the doors and save them, stopping their current hell. \u201cPlease, please stop this.\u201d He whispered, his voice shaking with fear. </p><p>They finally switched the machine off, and Peter watched her body sag back onto the chair. Her chest heaved as she tried to regain her breathing but it was clear she struggled. Each breath felt like there was a fire that licked at her lungs, combined with a heavy weight on her chest. The headpiece lifted from her face, and Peter gasped as he saw what it had done to her. Her nose bled heavily, her eyes were bloodshot and she had tears wetting her cheeks, below her right eye was a deep purple bruise from where the machine had been placed. She has a matching one below her eye and above her brow on her left side, the bruise even darker. Her hands were covered in blood from how hard she had been balling her hands into fists. One of the men rushed up to her to grab the mouth guard. He rolled his eyes and delivered a painful slap to her cheek just as he had done with Peter, when as he took it out, (y/n) turned and spit out the blood that had pooled in her mouth. </p><p>Her hearing had come back after the last round, and she fought to keep the rising bile down when he muttered, \u201cLet\u2019s go another round. She clearly isn\u2019t ready yet.\u201d He walked back to his place behind the large console that held the switch for the machine, another scientist put the guard back into her mouth and smirked at her. Behind the console they flipped the switch once more and sent (y/n) howling out in pain. </p><p>It felt like the air had been ripped from her lungs, it felt like someone sat on her chest and put a hand around her throat crushing her only way to breath. She gasped and yanked against the restraints, trying to get away from the pain but it just keep going on and on. In her struggle and failure to get away, she missed the banging of the door opening and every agent dropping with a single bullet to the head. There was no hesitation in the soldier\u2019s choice to down every agent, he didn\u2019t want to put up a fight with people who hurt those he cared about.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b0e3266e5fc0fc97d9fabbb3ce0a04b/tumblr_inline_phoytrqmq91ticqtz_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"130\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><h2>If you liked this, let me know!Leave a like and a reblog.
