It's most definitely and hopefully about the panic attacks but I think this might be situation we should discuss?",
        "answer": "<p>That\u2019s an interesting idea and at this point I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any other theories stating that. I\u2019d say it could be possible especially with the juffy they gave us in episodes six. The main thing holding this prediction back for me is the fact that Jonah is with Libby at the moment and I don\u2019t really think he\u2019d get into a relationship with a girl when he has a crush on a different one. Unless maybe he liked both of them at the same time-but if that was the case, whatever feelings he had for Buffy would kinda go away after getting a girlfriend I think. But I\u2019m always open for new ideas to speculate on so thank you!</p>",
