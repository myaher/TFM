You weren&rsquo;t sure which drink you\nwere on, but you didn&rsquo;t bother putting the bottle back anymore.</p><p>Blurry images of you and others on the team\nsplashed across the screen as speculative captions scrolled\nunderneath. The newscasters spoke like they were presenting new\nfacts, but were just finding more insulting ways to question or\nrepeat what everyone already knew.</p><p>There was another attack on the city. Some of the\nteam now known as the Avengers were on site to thwart it, but there\nwere casualties.</p><p>Taking another swig of the burning liquid, you\nwatched footage of you dodging an energy bolt fired by one of the\ncreatures. The bolt hit a car behind you.</p><p>The car wasn&rsquo;t empty.</p><p>Your stomach rolled as you set the glass down on\nthe bar with a dull thud. With any luck, the fire of the drink would\nat least counter the sinking feeling that got worse each time you saw\nthe footage.</p><p>\u201cJ.A.R.V.I.S., turn off that garbage.\u201d Tony&rsquo;s\ncommanding voice came from behind you.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d The television blipped out.</p><!-- more --><p>Although you hadn&rsquo;t heard him come into the\nlounge, you were more startled by the screen going blank than by his\nsudden presence.</p><p>Huffing out a sigh, you took another drink.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to single-handedly drink me dry\nhere, L/n?\u201d Leaning on the bar, Tony settled onto the stool next to\nyou.</p><p>His dark, perfectly shaped goatee and\nlightly\u00a0mussed hair managed to make him look put together even\nin his sweatpants. Brimming with his usual confidence,\u00a0his dark\neyes seemed to glitter as he tilted his head at you.</p><p>Dropping your eyes down to your glass, you put\nyour entire focus on it. Staring hard, you ran your thumb across the\ncondensation along the bottom half of your glass. The ice cubes were\nlong since melted, but the glass still hadn&rsquo;t warmed up all these\ndrinks later. They must have been going faster than you thought.</p><p>\u201cHuh. I didn&rsquo;t realize your hearing was damaged.\nShould we get the doctors back here? Or maybe I can just work on a\nhearing aid. You know, I could probably get you some spy-tech level\nhearing if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just go away.\u201d</p><p>Facing forward on his stool, Tony&rsquo;s eyes drifted\nover the many bottles sitting behind the bar. \u201cI&rsquo;m not going to do\nthat. You might not have heard, but I technically own this building,\nso <i>that</i> means I can go wherever I want.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes it was impossible to tell what was\narrogance and what was joking. But as irritation flooded your veins,\nyou didn&rsquo;t care. \u201c<i>Just leave me alone</i>.\u201d</p><p>He was utterly unfazed by your snarl. \u201cMm, no.\nNo, I&rsquo;m not going to do that either.\u201d</p><p>Reaching behind the bar, he grabbed a bowl of some\nsort of colourful dried fruit and nut mix. Turning to face you, he\nslid the bowl within your reach as he grabbed a handful. You refused\nto look up from your fingers as you traced around the rim of your\nglass.</p><p>Staring you down as he popped a few pieces in his\nmouth, he nudged the bowl closer to you.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Tony,\u201d you warned.</p><p>\u201cTell you what. I&rsquo;ll leave you alone if you let\nme take <i>this</i> and you take <i>this</i>,\u201d\nhe said as he plucked the glass out of your hand and shoved the bowl\nin its place.</p><p>\u201cAnd you let me say\nwhat I came in here to say.\u201d Finishing, he propped his elbow on the\nbar as he watched you.</p><p>Taking your glass away fanned your irritation into\nquiet anger. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the bottle was still sitting next\nto you. All you could picture was punching that smug face and taking\nyour drink back.</p><p>Your hand balled tightly, and it took all your\neffort to keep it on the bar.</p><p>Gritting your teeth, you shoved the bowl out of\nyour way and clasped both hands over the empty spot where your glass\nhad been. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry. And why the hell do you have food\nstashed there anyhow? Who hides little caches of food everywhere like\nthat?&rdquo;</p><p>Shrugging lightly, he threw another piece in his\nmouth. \u201cI get snacky. But <i>you</i> should be hungry, I don&rsquo;t\nthink you&rsquo;ve eaten since yesterday. Of course, to you, it might all\nbe one day since you&rsquo;re not really sleeping either.&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re spying on me now?\u201d</p><p>Not even trying to cover it, he nodded. \u201cSure.\nI&rsquo;m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You&rsquo;re</i> concerned? About <i>my</i>\nsleeping habits? So you&rsquo;re an arrogant asshole <i>and</i> a\nhypocrite. Got it.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted for a moment before lightly\ncreasing together. \u201cExcuse me? How does that make me a hypocrite?\u201d</p><p>Feeling the tension seize the muscles down your\narms, you just wanted to let the wave of anger pass. But the walls\nwere closing in and the anger was clawing at the insides of your\nchest, desperate to get out. Pressing your fingers against your\ntemple, you realized your hands were shaking slightly. \u201cBecause you\nshould get <i>your</i> shit together before getting on my case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, again&hellip;I&rsquo;m <i>concerned</i>&hellip;not\ngetting on your case. And second, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> fine.\u201d</p><p>Twisting suddenly, you threw your shoulder back to\nface him square on. \u201cFine? Really? So if I were to talk to Pepper,\nshe\u2019d tell me you sleep like a baby, right?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, his eyes darted away from yours. \u201cWell\nno, because I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> a baby. I&rsquo;m a <i>man</i>. She&rsquo;d tell you I\nsleep like a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you don&rsquo;t. You think no one notices you\nspend all your time in the lab? And I wonder why it is you don&rsquo;t\nsleep,\u201d you said in a low, biting tone. Your pulse was racing so\nhard your head throbbed. Muted colours pulsated around the edge of\nyour vision.</p><p>\u201cHere&rsquo;s the thing, we&rsquo;re not talking about me\nright now. And, I really need you to eat something.\u201d</p><p>Slapping the bowl away from his outstretched\nfingers, you sent it flying towards the lounge in a spray of nuts and\nfruit.</p><p>\u201c<i>I&rsquo;m not fucking hungry and I don&rsquo;t want any\nfucking peanuts!</i>\u201d</p><p>As it loudly bounced on the floor, the muscles in\nTony&rsquo;s cheeks flexed from his tightly clenched jaw. Turning away from\nyou, he looked back towards the wall of alcohol as he swallowed\nheavily. Not once did he glance towards the lounge that was now\nlittered with his food stash.</p><p>\u201cSo if that&rsquo;s all,\u201d you growled as you reached\nfor your glass.</p><p>Tony snatched your wrist as he continued to look\nforward. When he spoke, his voice was eerily calm and controlled.\n\u201cNo. That&rsquo;s <i>not</i> all. I never got to say what I came in here\nto say yet. That was part of the deal, remember?\u201d</p><p>Blinking slowly, he finally turned back to face\nyou with his hand gripping your wrist. There was something in his\nhard stare that forced everything inside you to flip. Although your\nheart still hammered against your chest, the reason was a blur. Fear?\nRegret?</p><p>His nostrils flared and he let go of you, but his\neyes never left yours. Finally, you looked away.</p><p>\u201cWell?

Brimming with his usual confidence,\u00a0his dark\neyes seemed to glitter as he tilted his head at you.</p><p>Dropping your eyes down to your glass, you put\nyour entire focus on it. Staring hard, you ran your thumb across the\ncondensation along the bottom half of your glass. The ice cubes were\nlong since melted, but the glass still hadn\u2019t warmed up all these\ndrinks later. They must have been going faster than you thought.</p><p>\u201cHuh. I didn\u2019t realize your hearing was damaged.\nShould we get the doctors back here? Or maybe I can just work on a\nhearing aid. You know, I could probably get you some spy-tech level\nhearing if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just go away.\u201d</p><p>Facing forward on his stool, Tony\u2019s eyes drifted\nover the many bottles sitting behind the bar. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do\nthat. You might not have heard, but I technically own this building,\nso <i>that</i> means I can go wherever I want.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes it was impossible to tell what was\narrogance and what was joking. But as irritation flooded your veins,\nyou didn\u2019t care. \u201c<i>Just leave me alone</i>.\u201d</p><p>He was utterly unfazed by your snarl. \u201cMm, no.\nNo, I\u2019m not going to do that either.\u201d</p><p>Reaching behind the bar, he grabbed a bowl of some\nsort of colourful dried fruit and nut mix. Turning to face you, he\nslid the bowl within your reach as he grabbed a handful. You refused\nto look up from your fingers as you traced around the rim of your\nglass.</p><p>Staring you down as he popped a few pieces in his\nmouth, he nudged the bowl closer to you.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Tony,\u201d you warned.</p><p>\u201cTell you what. I\u2019ll leave you alone if you let\nme take <i>this</i> and you take <i>this</i>,\u201d\nhe said as he plucked the glass out of your hand and shoved the bowl\nin its place.</p><p>\u201cAnd you let me say\nwhat I came in here to say.\u201d Finishing, he propped his elbow on the\nbar as he watched you.</p><p>Taking your glass away fanned your irritation into\nquiet anger. It didn\u2019t matter that the bottle was still sitting next\nto you. All you could picture was punching that smug face and taking\nyour drink back.</p><p>Your hand balled tightly, and it took all your\neffort to keep it on the bar.</p><p>Gritting your teeth, you shoved the bowl out of\nyour way and clasped both hands over the empty spot where your glass\nhad been. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry. And why the hell do you have food\nstashed there anyhow? Who hides little caches of food everywhere like\nthat?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging lightly, he threw another piece in his\nmouth. \u201cI get snacky. But <i>you</i> should be hungry, I don\u2019t\nthink you\u2019ve eaten since yesterday. Of course, to you, it might all\nbe one day since you\u2019re not really sleeping either.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spying on me now?\u201d</p><p>Not even trying to cover it, he nodded. \u201cSure.\nI\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> concerned? About <i>my</i>\nsleeping habits? So you\u2019re an arrogant asshole <i>and</i> a\nhypocrite. Got it.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted for a moment before lightly\ncreasing together. \u201cExcuse me? How does that make me a hypocrite?\u201d</p><p>Feeling the tension seize the muscles down your\narms, you just wanted to let the wave of anger pass. But the walls\nwere closing in and the anger was clawing at the insides of your\nchest, desperate to get out. Pressing your fingers against your\ntemple, you realized your hands were shaking slightly. \u201cBecause you\nshould get <i>your</i> shit together before getting on my case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, again\u2026I\u2019m <i>concerned</i>\u2026not\ngetting on your case. And second, <i>I\u2019m</i> fine.\u201d</p><p>Twisting suddenly, you threw your shoulder back to\nface him square on. \u201cFine? Really? So if I were to talk to Pepper,\nshe\u2019d tell me you sleep like a baby, right?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, his eyes darted away from yours. \u201cWell\nno, because I\u2019m <i>not</i> a baby. I\u2019m a <i>man</i>. She\u2019d tell you I\nsleep like a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you don\u2019t. You think no one notices you\nspend all your time in the lab? And I wonder why it is you don\u2019t\nsleep,\u201d you said in a low, biting tone. Your pulse was racing so\nhard your head throbbed. Muted colours pulsated around the edge of\nyour vision.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, we\u2019re not talking about me\nright now. And, I really need you to eat something.\u201d</p><p>Slapping the bowl away from his outstretched\nfingers, you sent it flying towards the lounge in a spray of nuts and\nfruit.</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m not fucking hungry and I don\u2019t want any\nfucking peanuts!</i>\u201d</p><p>As it loudly bounced on the floor, the muscles in\nTony\u2019s cheeks flexed from his tightly clenched jaw. Turning away from\nyou, he looked back towards the wall of alcohol as he swallowed\nheavily. Not once did he glance towards the lounge that was now\nlittered with his food stash.</p><p>\u201cSo if that\u2019s all,\u201d you growled as you reached\nfor your glass.</p><p>Tony snatched your wrist as he continued to look\nforward. When he spoke, his voice was eerily calm and controlled.\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s <i>not</i> all. I never got to say what I came in here\nto say yet. That was part of the deal, remember?\u201d</p><p>Blinking slowly, he finally turned back to face\nyou with his hand gripping your wrist. There was something in his\nhard stare that forced everything inside you to flip. Although your\nheart still hammered against your chest, the reason was a blur. Fear?\nRegret?</p><p>His nostrils flared and he let go of you, but his\neyes never left yours. Finally, you looked away.</p><p>\u201cWell? What is it then?\u201d The words were tough,\nbut the tone had no fire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he said firmly but\ngently.</p><p>Letting out a sudden exhale, your eyes snapped\nback to his. Inwardly, your unsteadiness grew, and it felt like you\nhad just been slapped. Your lips curled into a sneer. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you, Y/n. Ever since that mission, you\u2019ve\nbeen carrying around all this guilt, but it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d His\ndeep brown eyes seemed to be full of genuine concern as he bluntly\nlaid out his observation.</p><p>A lump rose in your throat and you bitterly choked\nit back down.</p><p>\u201cDid you not see? The people\u2026the\u00a0<i>family</i>\u2026in\nthat car? If I had kept the fight contained to the evacuated street,\nthat car wouldn\u2019t have been vaporized. It\u2019s my fault tha-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Your</i> fault?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was sharp as\nhe cut you off. Your sentence died with a glare.</p><p>Getting up from the stool, he spread his hands\napart. \u201cWas it your fault that the city was under attack? Because\n<i>that\u2019s</i> why people died, Y/n. And if you hadn\u2019t been there,\n<i>more</i> people would have died.\u201d</p><p>Tears started to sting and you quickly rubbed your\neyes, refusing to let them fall. \u201cSo what? I\u2019m just innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf <i>murder</i>? Yes. <i>Yes</i>, you\nabsolutely <i>are</i> innocent of that.\u201d</p><p>Sliding off your stool, you stood toe to toe to\nhim. \u201cDo\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0feel innocent, Tony? Is that why you\nstopped all Stark weapon production in one fell swoop? Is that why\nyou sleep like such a man?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared again as his gaze moved to the\nside. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? Business is business. It\u2019s not like you\nwere out there killing people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2026I\u2026\u201d Stopping with a\nfrustrated grunt, he rubbed his fingers along his forehead.</p><p>His eyebrows lifted with a look of determination\nbefore he tried again. \u201cSee, it <i>is</i> different. I don\u2019t sleep\nbecause I\u2019m working. That\u2019s it. And I stopped producing weapons\nbecause I knew I could do better. Stark could stand for something\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than contributing to the death of\ninnocent people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou being there didn\u2019t contribute to the death\nof that family. What happened to them was horrible, but it wasn\u2019t\n<i>your fault</i>.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, it felt like a slap each time he told you\nthat and it twisted your gut almost as harshly as seeing the video.\nWhen you spoke, you had to hiss it out past your teeth. \u201c<i>Stop\nsaying that</i>.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing his eyes closed, he let out a long sigh\nand dropped his arms. \u201cFine.

Some real food.\u201d</p><p>Your stomach was still tangled in knots and a rush\nof emotions still sat just at the back of your throat. But as he\ntucked you under his arm, the knots felt a little looser and it was a\nlittle easier to breathe.</p><p>And maybe you were a little hungry.</p><p>Looking back over at the lounge, you nodded to\nyour mess. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I at least clean that up?\u201d</p><p>Not slowing, Tony shrugged. \u201cNah.

But you were sure that wasn\u2019t right.\n\u201cN-no it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Tony shrugged again. Reaching the door,\nhe held it open and gently guided you from the room with his hand on\nyour back.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.

The bolt hit a car behind you.</p><p>The car wasn\u2019t empty.</p><p>Your stomach rolled as you set the glass down on\nthe bar with a dull thud. With any luck, the fire of the drink would\nat least counter the sinking feeling that got worse each time you saw\nthe footage.</p><p>\u201cJ.A.R.V.I.S., turn off that garbage.\u201d Tony\u2019s\ncommanding voice came from behind you.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d The television blipped out.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Although you hadn\u2019t heard him come into the\nlounge, you were more startled by the screen going blank than by his\nsudden presence.</p><p>Huffing out a sigh, you took another drink.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to single-handedly drink me dry\nhere, L/n?\u201d Leaning on the bar, Tony settled onto the stool next to\nyou.</p><p>His dark, perfectly shaped goatee and\nlightly\u00a0mussed hair managed to make him look put together even\nin his sweatpants. Brimming with his usual confidence,\u00a0his dark\neyes seemed to glitter as he tilted his head at you.</p><p>Dropping your eyes down to your glass, you put\nyour entire focus on it. Staring hard, you ran your thumb across the\ncondensation along the bottom half of your glass. The ice cubes were\nlong since melted, but the glass still hadn\u2019t warmed up all these\ndrinks later. They must have been going faster than you thought.</p><p>\u201cHuh. I didn\u2019t realize your hearing was damaged.\nShould we get the doctors back here? Or maybe I can just work on a\nhearing aid. You know, I could probably get you some spy-tech level\nhearing if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just go away.\u201d</p><p>Facing forward on his stool, Tony\u2019s eyes drifted\nover the many bottles sitting behind the bar. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do\nthat. You might not have heard, but I technically own this building,\nso <i>that</i> means I can go wherever I want.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes it was impossible to tell what was\narrogance and what was joking. But as irritation flooded your veins,\nyou didn\u2019t care. \u201c<i>Just leave me alone</i>.\u201d</p><p>He was utterly unfazed by your snarl. \u201cMm, no.\nNo, I\u2019m not going to do that either.\u201d</p><p>Reaching behind the bar, he grabbed a bowl of some\nsort of colourful dried fruit and nut mix. Turning to face you, he\nslid the bowl within your reach as he grabbed a handful. You refused\nto look up from your fingers as you traced around the rim of your\nglass.</p><p>Staring you down as he popped a few pieces in his\nmouth, he nudged the bowl closer to you.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Tony,\u201d you warned.</p><p>\u201cTell you what. I\u2019ll leave you alone if you let\nme take <i>this</i> and you take <i>this</i>,\u201d\nhe said as he plucked the glass out of your hand and shoved the bowl\nin its place.</p><p>\u201cAnd you let me say\nwhat I came in here to say.\u201d Finishing, he propped his elbow on the\nbar as he watched you.</p><p>Taking your glass away fanned your irritation into\nquiet anger. It didn\u2019t matter that the bottle was still sitting next\nto you. All you could picture was punching that smug face and taking\nyour drink back.</p><p>Your hand balled tightly, and it took all your\neffort to keep it on the bar.</p><p>Gritting your teeth, you shoved the bowl out of\nyour way and clasped both hands over the empty spot where your glass\nhad been. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry. And why the hell do you have food\nstashed there anyhow? Who hides little caches of food everywhere like\nthat?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging lightly, he threw another piece in his\nmouth. \u201cI get snacky. But <i>you</i> should be hungry, I don\u2019t\nthink you\u2019ve eaten since yesterday. Of course, to you, it might all\nbe one day since you\u2019re not really sleeping either.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spying on me now?\u201d</p><p>Not even trying to cover it, he nodded. \u201cSure.\nI\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> concerned? About <i>my</i>\nsleeping habits? So you\u2019re an arrogant asshole <i>and</i> a\nhypocrite. Got it.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted for a moment before lightly\ncreasing together. \u201cExcuse me? How does that make me a hypocrite?\u201d</p><p>Feeling the tension seize the muscles down your\narms, you just wanted to let the wave of anger pass. But the walls\nwere closing in and the anger was clawing at the insides of your\nchest, desperate to get out. Pressing your fingers against your\ntemple, you realized your hands were shaking slightly. \u201cBecause you\nshould get <i>your</i> shit together before getting on my case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, again\u2026I\u2019m <i>concerned</i>\u2026not\ngetting on your case. And second, <i>I\u2019m</i> fine.\u201d</p><p>Twisting suddenly, you threw your shoulder back to\nface him square on. \u201cFine? Really? So if I were to talk to Pepper,\nshe\u2019d tell me you sleep like a baby, right?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, his eyes darted away from yours. \u201cWell\nno, because I\u2019m <i>not</i> a baby. I\u2019m a <i>man</i>. She\u2019d tell you I\nsleep like a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you don\u2019t. You think no one notices you\nspend all your time in the lab? And I wonder why it is you don\u2019t\nsleep,\u201d you said in a low, biting tone. Your pulse was racing so\nhard your head throbbed. Muted colours pulsated around the edge of\nyour vision.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, we\u2019re not talking about me\nright now. And, I really need you to eat something.\u201d</p><p>Slapping the bowl away from his outstretched\nfingers, you sent it flying towards the lounge in a spray of nuts and\nfruit.</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m not fucking hungry and I don\u2019t want any\nfucking peanuts!</i>\u201d</p><p>As it loudly bounced on the floor, the muscles in\nTony\u2019s cheeks flexed from his tightly clenched jaw. Turning away from\nyou, he looked back towards the wall of alcohol as he swallowed\nheavily. Not once did he glance towards the lounge that was now\nlittered with his food stash.</p><p>\u201cSo if that\u2019s all,\u201d you growled as you reached\nfor your glass.</p><p>Tony snatched your wrist as he continued to look\nforward. When he spoke, his voice was eerily calm and controlled.\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s <i>not</i> all. I never got to say what I came in here\nto say yet. That was part of the deal, remember?\u201d</p><p>Blinking slowly, he finally turned back to face\nyou with his hand gripping your wrist. There was something in his\nhard stare that forced everything inside you to flip. Although your\nheart still hammered against your chest, the reason was a blur. Fear?\nRegret?</p><p>His nostrils flared and he let go of you, but his\neyes never left yours. Finally, you looked away.</p><p>\u201cWell? What is it then?\u201d The words were tough,\nbut the tone had no fire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he said firmly but\ngently.</p><p>Letting out a sudden exhale, your eyes snapped\nback to his. Inwardly, your unsteadiness grew, and it felt like you\nhad just been slapped. Your lips curled into a sneer. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you, Y/n. Ever since that mission, you\u2019ve\nbeen carrying around all this guilt, but it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d His\ndeep brown eyes seemed to be full of genuine concern as he bluntly\nlaid out his observation.</p><p>A lump rose in your throat and you bitterly choked\nit back down.</p><p>\u201cDid you not see? The people\u2026the\u00a0<i>family</i>\u2026in\nthat car? If I had kept the fight contained to the evacuated street,\nthat car wouldn\u2019t have been vaporized. It\u2019s my fault tha-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Your</i> fault?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was sharp as\nhe cut you off. Your sentence died with a glare.</p><p>Getting up from the stool, he spread his hands\napart. \u201cWas it your fault that the city was under attack? Because\n<i>that\u2019s</i> why people died, Y/n. And if you hadn\u2019t been there,\n<i>more</i> people would have died.\u201d</p><p>Tears started to sting and you quickly rubbed your\neyes, refusing to let them fall. \u201cSo what? I\u2019m just innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf <i>murder</i>? Yes. <i>Yes</i>, you\nabsolutely <i>are</i> innocent of that.\u201d</p><p>Sliding off your stool, you stood toe to toe to\nhim. \u201cDo\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0feel innocent, Tony? Is that why you\nstopped all Stark weapon production in one fell swoop? Is that why\nyou sleep like such a man?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared again as his gaze moved to the\nside. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? Business is business. It\u2019s not like you\nwere out there killing people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2026I\u2026\u201d Stopping with a\nfrustrated grunt, he rubbed his fingers along his forehead.</p><p>His eyebrows lifted with a look of determination\nbefore he tried again. \u201cSee, it <i>is</i> different. I don\u2019t sleep\nbecause I\u2019m working. That\u2019s it. And I stopped producing weapons\nbecause I knew I could do better. Stark could stand for something\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than contributing to the death of\ninnocent people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou being there didn\u2019t contribute to the death\nof that family. What happened to them was horrible, but it wasn\u2019t\n<i>your fault</i>.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, it felt like a slap each time he told you\nthat and it twisted your gut almost as harshly as seeing the video.\nWhen you spoke, you had to hiss it out past your teeth. \u201c<i>Stop\nsaying that</i>.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing his eyes closed, he let out a long sigh\nand dropped his arms. \u201cFine. Look, I don\u2019t sleep at night because I\ncan\u2019t. And it\u2019s not <i>exactly</i> guilt that keeps me up, but yeah,\nokay fine, there\u2019s stuff I need to deal with. And there\u2019s a lot I\nneed to let go. Happy?\u201d</p><p>The lump threatened to reform as your moment of\nrighteous anger dissolved. But you desperately wanted to hold onto\nthat anger since it was the only thing keeping everything else at\nbay. \u201cHappy that I\u2019m being hounded by a hypocrite? Not\nparticularly. We\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Your voice betrayed you as a waver ran through\nyour words.</p><p>Sidestepping from between the stools, you were\nready to storm out, but he quickly blocked your path. His hand\ncarefully found your arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of me as a hypocrite, then. Think\nof me as your ghost from Christmas future. You carry on like this,\nholding on to this stuff, and you\u2019re going to be just like me. I\nmean, not the billionaire playboy with all the best toys on the block\npart, of course.\u201d</p><p>He paused long enough to gauge your reaction.\nThere was none. He carried on, letting his faint grin drop.</p><p>\u201cBut the rest of it. I don\u2019t sleep\u2026I\n<i>can\u2019t\u2026</i>sleep. Do you have any idea how detrimental lack of\nsleep is on your brain functions? And I never stop long enough to\nrealize I\u2019m hungry, so Pepper has to practically force feed me. <i>She\u2019s</i>\nthe one who insisted on all the snack food everywhere. And that\u2019s\njust the benign stuff. I could really dig into it if you wanted me\nto, but the only reason I haven\u2019t wasted away is Pepper\u2019s sheer\nstubbornness. I mean obviously, don\u2019t tell her that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>His thumb rubbed over your arm as he shot you a\nsoft smile. But there was a deep sadness hiding behind it. \u201cSo when\nI say you need to let it go, you have to trust that I know what I\u2019m\ntalking about.\u201d</p><p>Another wave crashed over you and you drew your\nlips into a tight line as your chin quivered. Dropping your gaze, you\nfought to keep control. You were not about to let yourself break\ndown. \u201cHow? I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>You made no attempt to pick your sentence back up.</p><p>Moving to stand beside you, Tony put his arm\naround your shoulders in a half hug as he started guiding you out of\nthe lounge. \u201cClearly, I\u2026I don\u2019t know either. But I\u2019m pretty sure\nwe can at least start with food and some sleep. Some real food.\u201d</p><p>Your stomach was still tangled in knots and a rush\nof emotions still sat just at the back of your throat. But as he\ntucked you under his arm, the knots felt a little looser and it was a\nlittle easier to breathe.</p><p>And maybe you were a little hungry.</p><p>Looking back over at the lounge, you nodded to\nyour mess. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I at least clean that up?\u201d</p><p>Not slowing, Tony shrugged. \u201cNah. Hap\u2019ll\nget it. That\u2019s what I pay him for.\u201d</p><p>As you tried to add his comment up, you wondered\nif your exhaustion was winning. But you were sure that wasn\u2019t right.\n\u201cN-no it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Tony shrugged again. Reaching the door,\nhe held it open and gently guided you from the room with his hand on\nyour back.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.

With any luck, the fire of the drink would\nat least counter the sinking feeling that got worse each time you saw\nthe footage.</p><p>&ldquo;J.A.R.V.I.S., turn off that garbage.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s\ncommanding voice came from behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, sir.&rdquo; The television blipped out.</p><p>Although you hadn&rsquo;t heard him come into the\nlounge, you were more startled by the screen going blank than by his\nsudden presence.</p><p>Huffing out a sigh, you took another drink.</p><p>&ldquo;You trying to single-handedly drink me dry\nhere, L/n?&rdquo; Leaning on the bar, Tony settled onto the stool next to\nyou.</p><p>His dark, perfectly shaped goatee and\nlightly&nbsp;mussed hair managed to make him look put together even\nin his sweatpants. Brimming with his usual confidence,&nbsp;his dark\neyes seemed to glitter as he tilted his head at you.</p><p>Dropping your eyes down to your glass, you put\nyour entire focus on it. Staring hard, you ran your thumb across the\ncondensation along the bottom half of your glass. The ice cubes were\nlong since melted, but the glass still hadn&rsquo;t warmed up all these\ndrinks later. They must have been going faster than you thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh. I didn&rsquo;t realize your hearing was damaged.\nShould we get the doctors back here? Or maybe I can just work on a\nhearing aid. You know, I could probably get you some spy-tech level\nhearing if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop. Just go away.&rdquo;</p><p>Facing forward on his stool, Tony&rsquo;s eyes drifted\nover the many bottles sitting behind the bar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do\nthat. You might not have heard, but I technically own this building,\nso <i>that</i> means I can go wherever I want.&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes it was impossible to tell what was\narrogance and what was joking. But as irritation flooded your veins,\nyou didn&rsquo;t care. &ldquo;<i>Just leave me alone</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>He was utterly unfazed by your snarl. &ldquo;Mm, no.\nNo, I&rsquo;m not going to do that either.&rdquo;</p><p>Reaching behind the bar, he grabbed a bowl of some\nsort of colourful dried fruit and nut mix. Turning to face you, he\nslid the bowl within your reach as he grabbed a handful. You refused\nto look up from your fingers as you traced around the rim of your\nglass.</p><p>Staring you down as he popped a few pieces in his\nmouth, he nudged the bowl closer to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, Tony,&rdquo; you warned.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell you what. I&rsquo;ll leave you alone if you let\nme take <i>this</i> and you take <i>this</i>,&rdquo;\nhe said as he plucked the glass out of your hand and shoved the bowl\nin its place.</p><p>&ldquo;And you let me say\nwhat I came in here to say.&rdquo; Finishing, he propped his elbow on the\nbar as he watched you.</p><p>Taking your glass away fanned your irritation into\nquiet anger. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the bottle was still sitting next\nto you. All you could picture was punching that smug face and taking\nyour drink back.</p><p>Your hand balled tightly, and it took all your\neffort to keep it on the bar.</p><p>Gritting your teeth, you shoved the bowl out of\nyour way and clasped both hands over the empty spot where your glass\nhad been. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry. And why the hell do you have food\nstashed there anyhow? Who hides little caches of food everywhere like\nthat?&rdquo;</p><p>Shrugging lightly, he threw another piece in his\nmouth. &ldquo;I get snacky. But <i>you</i> should be hungry, I don&rsquo;t\nthink you&rsquo;ve eaten since yesterday. Of course, to you, it might all\nbe one day since you&rsquo;re not really sleeping either.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re spying on me now?&rdquo;</p><p>Not even trying to cover it, he nodded. &ldquo;Sure.\nI&rsquo;m concerned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> concerned? About <i>my</i>\nsleeping habits? So you&rsquo;re an arrogant asshole <i>and</i> a\nhypocrite. Got it.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyebrows lifted for a moment before lightly\ncreasing together. &ldquo;Excuse me? How does that make me a hypocrite?&rdquo;</p><p>Feeling the tension seize the muscles down your\narms, you just wanted to let the wave of anger pass. But the walls\nwere closing in and the anger was clawing at the insides of your\nchest, desperate to get out. Pressing your fingers against your\ntemple, you realized your hands were shaking slightly. &ldquo;Because you\nshould get <i>your</i> shit together before getting on my case.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, again&hellip;I&rsquo;m <i>concerned</i>&hellip;not\ngetting on your case. And second, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Twisting suddenly, you threw your shoulder back to\nface him square on. &ldquo;Fine? Really? So if I were to talk to Pepper,\nshe&rsquo;d tell me you sleep like a baby, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Frowning, his eyes darted away from yours. &ldquo;Well\nno, because I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> a baby. I&rsquo;m a <i>man</i>. She&rsquo;d tell you I\nsleep like a man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only you don&rsquo;t. You think no one notices you\nspend all your time in the lab? And I wonder why it is you don&rsquo;t\nsleep,&rdquo; you said in a low, biting tone. Your pulse was racing so\nhard your head throbbed. Muted colours pulsated around the edge of\nyour vision.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thing, we&rsquo;re not talking about me\nright now. And, I really need you to eat something.&rdquo;</p><p>Slapping the bowl away from his outstretched\nfingers, you sent it flying towards the lounge in a spray of nuts and\nfruit.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m not fucking hungry and I don&rsquo;t want any\nfucking peanuts!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>As it loudly bounced on the floor, the muscles in\nTony&rsquo;s cheeks flexed from his tightly clenched jaw. Turning away from\nyou, he looked back towards the wall of alcohol as he swallowed\nheavily. Not once did he glance towards the lounge that was now\nlittered with his food stash.</p><p>&ldquo;So if that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; you growled as you reached\nfor your glass.</p><p>Tony snatched your wrist as he continued to look\nforward. When he spoke, his voice was eerily calm and controlled.\n&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s <i>not</i> all. I never got to say what I came in here\nto say yet. That was part of the deal, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>Blinking slowly, he finally turned back to face\nyou with his hand gripping your wrist. There was something in his\nhard stare that forced everything inside you to flip. Although your\nheart still hammered against your chest, the reason was a blur. Fear?\nRegret?</p><p>His nostrils flared and he let go of you, but his\neyes never left yours. Finally, you looked away.</p><p>&ldquo;Well? What is it then?&rdquo; The words were tough,\nbut the tone had no fire.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; he said firmly but\ngently.</p><p>Letting out a sudden exhale, your eyes snapped\nback to his. Inwardly, your unsteadiness grew, and it felt like you\nhad just been slapped. Your lips curled into a sneer. &ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see you, Y/n. Ever since that mission, you&rsquo;ve\nbeen carrying around all this guilt, but it&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo; His\ndeep brown eyes seemed to be full of genuine concern as he bluntly\nlaid out his observation.</p><p>A lump rose in your throat and you bitterly choked\nit back down.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you not see? The people&hellip;the&nbsp;<i>family</i>&hellip;in\nthat car? If I had kept the fight contained to the evacuated street,\nthat car wouldn&rsquo;t have been vaporized. It&rsquo;s my fault tha-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Your</i> fault?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice was sharp as\nhe cut you off. Your sentence died with a glare.</p><p>Getting up from the stool, he spread his hands\napart. &ldquo;Was it your fault that the city was under attack? Because\n<i>that&rsquo;s</i> why people died, Y/n. And if you hadn&rsquo;t been there,\n<i>more</i> people would have died.&rdquo;</p><p>Tears started to sting and you quickly rubbed your\neyes, refusing to let them fall. &ldquo;So what? I&rsquo;m just innocent?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of <i>murder</i>? Yes. <i>Yes</i>, you\nabsolutely <i>are</i> innocent of that.&rdquo;</p><p>Sliding off your stool, you stood toe to toe to\nhim. &ldquo;Do&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;feel innocent, Tony? Is that why you\nstopped all Stark weapon production in one fell swoop? Is that why\nyou sleep like such a man?&rdquo;</p><p>His nostrils flared again as his gaze moved to the\nside. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it? Business is business. It&rsquo;s not like you\nwere out there killing people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo; Stopping with a\nfrustrated grunt, he rubbed his fingers along his forehead.</p><p>His eyebrows lifted with a look of determination\nbefore he tried again. &ldquo;See, it <i>is</i> different. I don&rsquo;t sleep\nbecause I&rsquo;m working. That&rsquo;s it. And I stopped producing weapons\nbecause I knew I could do better. Stark could stand for something\nbetter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Better than contributing to the death of\ninnocent people?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You being there didn&rsquo;t contribute to the death\nof that family. What happened to them was horrible, but it wasn&rsquo;t\n<i>your fault</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Somehow, it felt like a slap each time he told you\nthat and it twisted your gut almost as harshly as seeing the video.\nWhen you spoke, you had to hiss it out past your teeth. &ldquo;<i>Stop\nsaying that</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Squeezing his eyes closed, he let out a long sigh\nand dropped his arms. &ldquo;Fine. Look, I don&rsquo;t sleep at night because I\ncan&rsquo;t. And it&rsquo;s not <i>exactly</i> guilt that keeps me up, but yeah,\nokay fine, there&rsquo;s stuff I need to deal with. And there&rsquo;s a lot I\nneed to let go. Happy?&rdquo;</p><p>The lump threatened to reform as your moment of\nrighteous anger dissolved. But you desperately wanted to hold onto\nthat anger since it was the only thing keeping everything else at\nbay. &ldquo;Happy that I&rsquo;m being hounded by a hypocrite? Not\nparticularly. We&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p><p>Your voice betrayed you as a waver ran through\nyour words.</p><p>Sidestepping from between the stools, you were\nready to storm out, but he quickly blocked your path. His hand\ncarefully found your arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of me as a hypocrite, then. Think\nof me as your ghost from Christmas future. You carry on like this,\nholding on to this stuff, and you&rsquo;re going to be just like me. I\nmean, not the billionaire playboy with all the best toys on the block\npart, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused long enough to gauge your reaction.\nThere was none. He carried on, letting his faint grin drop.</p><p>&ldquo;But the rest of it. I don&rsquo;t sleep&hellip;I\n<i>can&rsquo;t&hellip;</i>sleep. Do you have any idea how detrimental lack of\nsleep is on your brain functions? And I never stop long enough to\nrealize I&rsquo;m hungry, so Pepper has to practically force feed me. <i>She&rsquo;s</i>\nthe one who insisted on all the snack food everywhere. And that&rsquo;s\njust the benign stuff. I could really dig into it if you wanted me\nto, but the only reason I haven&rsquo;t wasted away is Pepper&rsquo;s sheer\nstubbornness. I mean obviously, don&rsquo;t tell her that, but it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p><p>His thumb rubbed over your arm as he shot you a\nsoft smile. But there was a deep sadness hiding behind it. &ldquo;So when\nI say you need to let it go, you have to trust that I know what I&rsquo;m\ntalking about.&rdquo;</p><p>Another wave crashed over you and you drew your\nlips into a tight line as your chin quivered. Dropping your gaze, you\nfought to keep control. You were not about to let yourself break\ndown. &ldquo;How? I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You made no attempt to pick your sentence back up.</p><p>Moving to stand beside you, Tony put his arm\naround your shoulders in a half hug as he started guiding you out of\nthe lounge. &ldquo;Clearly, I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know either. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure\nwe can at least start with food and some sleep. Some real food.&rdquo;</p><p>Your stomach was still tangled in knots and a rush\nof emotions still sat just at the back of your throat. But as he\ntucked you under his arm, the knots felt a little looser and it was a\nlittle easier to breathe.</p><p>And maybe you were a little hungry.</p><p>Looking back over at the lounge, you nodded to\nyour mess. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I at least clean that up?&rdquo;</p><p>Not slowing, Tony shrugged. &ldquo;Nah. Hap&rsquo;ll\nget it. That&rsquo;s what I pay him for.&rdquo;</p><p>As you tried to add his comment up, you wondered\nif your exhaustion was winning. But you were sure that wasn&rsquo;t right.\n&ldquo;N-no it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p><p>Grinning, Tony shrugged again. Reaching the door,\nhe held it open and gently guided you from the room with his hand on\nyour back.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever. He&rsquo;ll do it anyhow.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Taglist:&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB1iabpAVUTx4d_OOt73F-g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB1iabpAVUTx4d_OOt73F-g\">@foreverfaeries</a> &nbsp;<a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo1fk7qB1cOJlnwrb2uvPaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo1fk7qB1cOJlnwrb2uvPaw\">@flower-two</a> &nbsp;<a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVPzQd_fJvi5LE3iPr6ymEA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVPzQd_fJvi5LE3iPr6ymEA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVPzQd_fJvi5LE3iPr6ymEA\">@getlostinyourparadise</a> &nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHw85reHMc43WzjyARrTpag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHw85reHMc43WzjyARrTpag\">@selfishkiddo</a> <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_5h2jOceNbqvT4c2BVCjnw\">@angelicshinigami</a> &nbsp; <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwgccOhzqadZ4S1NSERKPcA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwgccOhzqadZ4S1NSERKPcA\">@natsukitakama</a>\n\n</p>",
