        "caption": "<h2>Day One</h2><p><b>Arya and Gendry exchange gifts.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>Arya had spent days deciding what to give Gendry for Christmas. He never mentioned wanting anything, ever. It made it especially difficult around the holidays. She had already gotten gifts for her family and even Hot Pie. Hot Pie was arguably the easiest person to shop for; all she had to do was buy him a gift card to the cookware store down the street. She got Sansa some palette from their local makeup shop; Arya couldn\u2019t tell you if it was any good, all she knew was that the consultant wouldn\u2019t stop pushing it on her, so she bought it. Jon was getting a Night\u2019s Watch shirt that she bought at their concert over the summer. Robb, well, Robb was getting a pathetic painting she had made in her art class over the course of the semester. Bran was getting the DVD set for the Three Eyed Raven movies he raved about so often. Since he was still young and impressionable, Arya was getting Rickon a fencing sword so she could convince him to join the sport she loved so dearly. She never missed how excited he got when he came to her matches. He practically leaped out of his seat whenever she won. </p><p>Arya didn\u2019t have to worry about her parent\u2019s gift since her and her siblings had all gone in and bought them tickets to visit Bravos earlier in the year. Boy were they in for a surprise when they opened their present. She hoped they would like it there. </p><p>She had succeeded in finding all of them gifts, yet here she sat on some old park bench in town, still attempting to figure out what to get Gendry. Why was it so hard for her to find something for him? Yes, he was her best friend, and he meant the world to her, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to be this difficult. Standing abruptly, Arya decided it would be best to walk around and window shop for him one more time. Nearing the final few stores she stopped. Something hanging from the ceiling in the pop-up Christmas shop had caught her eye. </p><p>The door opened with a feint jingle as she walked inside. Christmas ornaments hung from the ceiling on fishing-wire making it seem like they were floating in the air. Arya had never bothered coming in this store before, she assumed that there wouldn\u2019t been anything in here that interested her or anything for Gendry\u2019s present. Surprised was the only word that could describe her right this very moment. This store was beautiful. Each ornament looked to be handmade, either forged from steel, wire, or rope. She looked around for a short while before walking up to the check out desk to ask for the ornament she had seen in the window, she hadn\u2019t been able to find it throughout the rest of the store. </p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d A blonde-haired boy from beyond the counter said. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw an ornament in the window that I really want, but I can\u2019t seem to find it around the store.\u201d The boy nodded and walked around the counter. </p><p>\u201cCan you point it out to me?\u201d He asked gently as they walked toward the single window. Arya pointed to it and didn\u2019t miss how the boy smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re very lucky. This is a one-of-a-kind ornament. A lot of people have come in asking to buy it, but our boss wouldn\u2019t let us sell it until today. Something about it being near and dear to a memory from earlier in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. It is my lucky day, I\u2019ve been looking all over for a gift for my best friend. I haven\u2019t been able to find one, not till today that is.\u201d</p><p>Together they walked to the counter and Arya waited as he rung her up. She handed over the money and waited for the boy to give her both her bag and her change. Wishing each other a happy holiday before they went their separate ways. With her bag in hand Arya walked back outside the shop and into the cold air. Lucky for her she had a thick scarf Sansa gave her for Christmas last year wrapped around her neck. It always reached freezing temperatures in the North this part of the year, hells even in the summer it was cold to southerners that came to visit. She remembered the first year Gendry had moved to into town. It was nearing the end of summer and he was in a winter coat every day as people native to the north walked around in short-sleeved shirts. He was also fairly tan, something uncommon for the people in the north. She remembered her father saying that he needed to take care of Gendry for an old friend of his. He said he deserved a better life than the one he was living, that Gendry hadn\u2019t done anything to deserve how his father wife treated him since Robert passed. So, her father took Gendry in, just as he took Jon in when his parents got into a car accident sometime after his first birthday. Arya had grown to love Jon as a brother, but for some reason she could never see Gendry that way. He was fifteen when he first moved in with them, she was twelve, maybe it was due to him coming much later in life. She had grown up with Jon in their home, unlike Gendry. He was the handsome, mysterious, and incredibly stupid boy that moved into their home and took Jon and Robb away from her. She got over that feeling soon enough and took Gendry on as her best friend. Life had been a lot different when Robb, Jon, and Gendry went off to school. She had lost almost all of her best friends, aside from Hot Pie who had stayed in town to attend their local culinary program.</p><p>She smiled fondly at her childhood memories and continued to walk back home. She all but burst into a sprint when she saw that Jon\u2019s car was in the driveway. She searched through all the rooms downstair and bolted to the second floor. As she flung open the door to his room she yelped and covered her eyes. Gendry was inside in only his briefs sitting in the chair next to Jon\u2019s desk. He had his phone in his hand before he too jumped and threw it in the air. </p><p>\u201cHells, Arya!\u201d He said clutching at his chest with one of his hands. Arya couldn\u2019t help it, really, she couldn\u2019t. Her eyes looked down at his briefs, she could feel her cheeks heating up. She averted her eyes but it was too late. Gendry had caught her staring at his underwear and he too started to blush, all the while laughing which made her blush deepen even more. Gendry ignored her discomfort and walked over to her standing right before her. He grabbed her by the waist and lifted her up into a tight hug. Arya hugged him back, forgetting about his clothing situation. She hadn\u2019t seen her best friend in months and she missed him dearly. She missed spending as many hours in day with him that she could. She missed the way they would fall asleep next to one another while watching a movie. She missed having him with her whenever she felt lonely. She couldn\u2019t count the number over people who asked them if they were dating over the years. Arya and Gendry would take turns telling people that, \u201cno they weren\u2019t a couple.\u201d Arya had wondered what it would be like if her and Gendry did date. She couldn\u2019t imagine it being much different than what they were now. They had always been affectionate with one another, but they had never kissed. They had hugged and held hands whenever it was appropriate, but never took that next step. She guessed you could say they were comfortable. When he put her down he reached into a duffle-bag and pulled out a pair of dark grey sweatpants and winked at her before pulling them on. Arya rolled her eyes but laughed. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you have there?\u201d Gendry asked her innocently.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing, just your Christmas present.\u201d Arya teased innocently, putting the bag behind her back. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it tomorrow, so just forget you saw anything.\u201d </p><p>Gendry chuckled and held up a poorly wrapped box. \u201cAnd I have your\u2019s.\u201d Arya didn\u2019t miss the way his eyes lit up when he looked at the box in his hands. She slowly backed out of Jon\u2019s room and into her own throwing \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow\u201d over her left shoulder. Sleep didn\u2019t come easy to her that night, but she didn\u2019t feel even the slightest bit tired when she woke-up in the morning.</p><p>Their family Christmas was brief, each person opening their designated gifts before they gave their parents the surprise. They were elated and went off to pack immediately since they needed to leave around mid-day. Arya and Gendry still had not exchanged their gifts though. Since she could remember they always did it separately. By the time everyone was settled down and her parents had left for their trip it was nearing four in the afternoon. Arya was sitting on her bed staring out the window to her right as she watched the snow fall gently outside. When she heard the knock on her door she suddenly got nervous. Arya never really worried about Gendry\u2019s present, but this year was different, something between them had changed over their separation while he was away at university. Maybe it was missing one another that put their feelings into perspective. She wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you when it began to change, not even if she thought about it for years. </p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said faintly, her eyes still glued to the scene outside her window. Gendry entered her room and closed the door behind him with a faint click. He looked at her then, and in that moment he was sure he had never seen anything as beautiful as Arya Stark. The way she was enveloped in pure calmness just from looking at the weather outside was something out of a romance novel. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Arya turned her head towards him, her grey eyes gleaming as she looked at him. \u201cI felt like I haven\u2019t seen you all day. Are you ready for our annual gift exchange.\u201d </p><p>Nodding she moved and grabbed her bag from the floor of her closet. When she turned around Gendry was sitting on her bed, his legs hung off the side of her mattress. She jumped on the bed, her excitement out-weighing her nervousness. When she got herself situated with her legs criss-cross underneath her, Arya held her gift bag out to Gendry with a wide smile, a smile that would never cease to make his cheeks burn red with embarrassment at just how affected he was by her. He handed her the small box and waited for her to open it, but she just sat there staring at him. </p><p>\u201cOpen it you stupid. I opened mine first last year it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Gendry huffed out a laugh and pulled the wad of tissue paper from the tiny bag. He unwrapped it slowly, making her sit in anticipation for what felt like minutes before he pulled the small ornament free. His mouth was open and his eyes were starting to water. In his hands rested a small bull which brought back memories of their first few years together. He remembered telling her the stories of how people back home would call him bull headed so he made a helmet shaped like a bull helm in his metal working class.</p><p>\u201cArya, thank you. I love it.\u201d He smiled at her and rested his hand on top of her thigh. \u201cNow, please, open your present.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head and began to tear the festive paper from the small box she held in her hands. When she had removed the top her heat began to beat faster and faster. The box was small and looked like it held some type of jewelry. Gendry knew she tended not to wear such girly things, and she was worried that she would need to pretend to like whatever was in the box. But, as she removed the lid she was overwhelmed at the beauty of the small bracelet inside. There was a metal wolf looked to be forged from obsidian held in the center by two thin straps of leather.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Gendry asked as he scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t a big fan of jewelry, but I was messing around in my metal working class and made the wolf. I knew I wanted to give it to you for Christmas, but I wasn\u2019t sure how. So, I attached it to a stip of leather and figured I\u2019d give it to you as a bracelet. If you don\u2019t like it I-\u201d </p><p>Gendry was cut off as she leapt into his arms, her face buried into his neck. \u201cI love it. Now help me put it on!\u201d </p><p>He took the bracelet from the box and unhooked the small clasp he added to the back. He took her small wrist in his hand and clasped his piece gently, his fingers lingering on her skin a few second too long. She looked at him then and grabbed his hand. \u201cGendry, I\u2019ve never gotten any gift that compares to this. Thank you.\u201d </p><p>He smiled down at her scooting across the bed to lay his head on the pillow next to her. It took only a minute for her to rest her head on his chest, ignoring the butterflies in his belly he wrapped his arm around her. He looked down at her then and he knew he would never want to leave this moment.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Arya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Gendry.\u201d</p>",

Arya couldn\u2019t help it, really, she couldn\u2019t. Her eyes looked down at his briefs, she could feel her cheeks heating up. She averted her eyes but it was too late. Gendry had caught her staring at his underwear and he too started to blush, all the while laughing which made her blush deepen even more. Gendry ignored her discomfort and walked over to her standing right before her. He grabbed her by the waist and lifted her up into a tight hug. Arya hugged him back, forgetting about his clothing situation. She hadn\u2019t seen her best friend in months and she missed him dearly. She missed spending as many hours in day with him that she could. She missed the way they would fall asleep next to one another while watching a movie. She missed having him with her whenever she felt lonely. She couldn\u2019t count the number over people who asked them if they were dating over the years. Arya and Gendry would take turns telling people that, \u201cno they weren\u2019t a couple.\u201d Arya had wondered what it would be like if her and Gendry did date. She couldn\u2019t imagine it being much different than what they were now. They had always been affectionate with one another, but they had never kissed. They had hugged and held hands whenever it was appropriate, but never took that next step. She guessed you could say they were comfortable. When he put her down he reached into a duffle-bag and pulled out a pair of dark grey sweatpants and winked at her before pulling them on. Arya rolled her eyes but laughed. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you have there?\u201d Gendry asked her innocently.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing, just your Christmas present.\u201d Arya teased innocently, putting the bag behind her back. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it tomorrow, so just forget you saw anything.\u201d </p><p>Gendry chuckled and held up a poorly wrapped box. \u201cAnd I have your\u2019s.\u201d Arya didn\u2019t miss the way his eyes lit up when he looked at the box in his hands. She slowly backed out of Jon\u2019s room and into her own throwing \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow\u201d over her left shoulder. Sleep didn\u2019t come easy to her that night, but she didn\u2019t feel even the slightest bit tired when she woke-up in the morning.</p><p>Their family Christmas was brief, each person opening their designated gifts before they gave their parents the surprise. They were elated and went off to pack immediately since they needed to leave around mid-day. Arya and Gendry still had not exchanged their gifts though. Since she could remember they always did it separately. By the time everyone was settled down and her parents had left for their trip it was nearing four in the afternoon. Arya was sitting on her bed staring out the window to her right as she watched the snow fall gently outside. When she heard the knock on her door she suddenly got nervous. Arya never really worried about Gendry\u2019s present, but this year was different, something between them had changed over their separation while he was away at university. Maybe it was missing one another that put their feelings into perspective. She wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you when it began to change, not even if she thought about it for years. </p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said faintly, her eyes still glued to the scene outside her window. Gendry entered her room and closed the door behind him with a faint click. He looked at her then, and in that moment he was sure he had never seen anything as beautiful as Arya Stark. The way she was enveloped in pure calmness just from looking at the weather outside was something out of a romance novel. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Arya turned her head towards him, her grey eyes gleaming as she looked at him. \u201cI felt like I haven\u2019t seen you all day. Are you ready for our annual gift exchange.\u201d </p><p>Nodding she moved and grabbed her bag from the floor of her closet. When she turned around Gendry was sitting on her bed, his legs hung off the side of her mattress. She jumped on the bed, her excitement out-weighing her nervousness. When she got herself situated with her legs criss-cross underneath her, Arya held her gift bag out to Gendry with a wide smile, a smile that would never cease to make his cheeks burn red with embarrassment at just how affected he was by her. He handed her the small box and waited for her to open it, but she just sat there staring at him. </p><p>\u201cOpen it you stupid. I opened mine first last year it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Gendry huffed out a laugh and pulled the wad of tissue paper from the tiny bag. He unwrapped it slowly, making her sit in anticipation for what felt like minutes before he pulled the small ornament free. His mouth was open and his eyes were starting to water. In his hands rested a small bull which brought back memories of their first few years together. He remembered telling her the stories of how people back home would call him bull headed so he made a helmet shaped like a bull helm in his metal working class.</p><p>\u201cArya, thank you. I love it.\u201d He smiled at her and rested his hand on top of her thigh. \u201cNow, please, open your present.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head and began to tear the festive paper from the small box she held in her hands. When she had removed the top her heat began to beat faster and faster. The box was small and looked like it held some type of jewelry. Gendry knew she tended not to wear such girly things, and she was worried that she would need to pretend to like whatever was in the box. But, as she removed the lid she was overwhelmed at the beauty of the small bracelet inside. There was a metal wolf looked to be forged from obsidian held in the center by two thin straps of leather.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Gendry asked as he scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t a big fan of jewelry, but I was messing around in my metal working class and made the wolf. I knew I wanted to give it to you for Christmas, but I wasn\u2019t sure how. So, I attached it to a stip of leather and figured I\u2019d give it to you as a bracelet. If you don\u2019t like it I-\u201d </p><p>Gendry was cut off as she leapt into his arms, her face buried into his neck. \u201cI love it. Now help me put it on!\u201d </p><p>He took the bracelet from the box and unhooked the small clasp he added to the back. He took her small wrist in his hand and clasped his piece gently, his fingers lingering on her skin a few second too long. She looked at him then and grabbed his hand. \u201cGendry, I\u2019ve never gotten any gift that compares to this. Thank you.\u201d </p><p>He smiled down at her scooting across the bed to lay his head on the pillow next to her. It took only a minute for her to rest her head on his chest, ignoring the butterflies in his belly he wrapped his arm around her. He looked down at her then and he knew he would never want to leave this moment.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Arya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Gendry.\u201d</p></p>",

He never mentioned wanting anything, ever. It made it especially difficult around the holidays. She had already gotten gifts for her family and even Hot Pie. Hot Pie was arguably the easiest person to shop for; all she had to do was buy him a gift card to the cookware store down the street. She got Sansa some palette from their local makeup shop; Arya couldn\u2019t tell you if it was any good, all she knew was that the consultant wouldn\u2019t stop pushing it on her, so she bought it. Jon was getting a Night\u2019s Watch shirt that she bought at their concert over the summer. Robb, well, Robb was getting a pathetic painting she had made in her art class over the course of the semester. Bran was getting the DVD set for the Three Eyed Raven movies he raved about so often. Since he was still young and impressionable, Arya was getting Rickon a fencing sword so she could convince him to join the sport she loved so dearly. She never missed how excited he got when he came to her matches. He practically leaped out of his seat whenever she won. </p><p>Arya didn\u2019t have to worry about her parent\u2019s gift since her and her siblings had all gone in and bought them tickets to visit Bravos earlier in the year. Boy were they in for a surprise when they opened their present. She hoped they would like it there. </p><p>She had succeeded in finding all of them gifts, yet here she sat on some old park bench in town, still attempting to figure out what to get Gendry. Why was it so hard for her to find something for him? Yes, he was her best friend, and he meant the world to her, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to be this difficult. Standing abruptly, Arya decided it would be best to walk around and window shop for him one more time. Nearing the final few stores she stopped. Something hanging from the ceiling in the pop-up Christmas shop had caught her eye. </p><p>The door opened with a feint jingle as she walked inside. Christmas ornaments hung from the ceiling on fishing-wire making it seem like they were floating in the air. Arya had never bothered coming in this store before, she assumed that there wouldn\u2019t been anything in here that interested her or anything for Gendry\u2019s present. Surprised was the only word that could describe her right this very moment. This store was beautiful. Each ornament looked to be handmade, either forged from steel, wire, or rope. She looked around for a short while before walking up to the check out desk to ask for the ornament she had seen in the window, she hadn\u2019t been able to find it throughout the rest of the store. </p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d A blonde-haired boy from beyond the counter said. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw an ornament in the window that I really want, but I can\u2019t seem to find it around the store.\u201d The boy nodded and walked around the counter. </p><p>\u201cCan you point it out to me?\u201d He asked gently as they walked toward the single window. Arya pointed to it and didn\u2019t miss how the boy smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re very lucky. This is a one-of-a-kind ornament. A lot of people have come in asking to buy it, but our boss wouldn\u2019t let us sell it until today. Something about it being near and dear to a memory from earlier in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. It is my lucky day, I\u2019ve been looking all over for a gift for my best friend. I haven\u2019t been able to find one, not till today that is.\u201d</p><p>Together they walked to the counter and Arya waited as he rung her up. She handed over the money and waited for the boy to give her both her bag and her change. Wishing each other a happy holiday before they went their separate ways. With her bag in hand Arya walked back outside the shop and into the cold air. Lucky for her she had a thick scarf Sansa gave her for Christmas last year wrapped around her neck. It always reached freezing temperatures in the North this part of the year, hells even in the summer it was cold to southerners that came to visit. She remembered the first year Gendry had moved to into town. It was nearing the end of summer and he was in a winter coat every day as people native to the north walked around in short-sleeved shirts. He was also fairly tan, something uncommon for the people in the north. She remembered her father saying that he needed to take care of Gendry for an old friend of his. He said he deserved a better life than the one he was living, that Gendry hadn\u2019t done anything to deserve how his father wife treated him since Robert passed. So, her father took Gendry in, just as he took Jon in when his parents got into a car accident sometime after his first birthday. Arya had grown to love Jon as a brother, but for some reason she could never see Gendry that way. He was fifteen when he first moved in with them, she was twelve, maybe it was due to him coming much later in life. She had grown up with Jon in their home, unlike Gendry. He was the handsome, mysterious, and incredibly stupid boy that moved into their home and took Jon and Robb away from her. She got over that feeling soon enough and took Gendry on as her best friend. Life had been a lot different when Robb, Jon, and Gendry went off to school. She had lost almost all of her best friends, aside from Hot Pie who had stayed in town to attend their local culinary program.</p><p>She smiled fondly at her childhood memories and continued to walk back home. She all but burst into a sprint when she saw that Jon\u2019s car was in the driveway. She searched through all the rooms downstair and bolted to the second floor. As she flung open the door to his room she yelped and covered her eyes. Gendry was inside in only his briefs sitting in the chair next to Jon\u2019s desk. He had his phone in his hand before he too jumped and threw it in the air. </p><p>\u201cHells, Arya!\u201d He said clutching at his chest with one of his hands. Arya couldn\u2019t help it, really, she couldn\u2019t. Her eyes looked down at his briefs, she could feel her cheeks heating up. She averted her eyes but it was too late. Gendry had caught her staring at his underwear and he too started to blush, all the while laughing which made her blush deepen even more.

She missed having him with her whenever she felt lonely. She couldn\u2019t count the number over people who asked them if they were dating over the years.

He was the handsome, mysterious, and incredibly stupid boy that moved into their home and took Jon and Robb away from her. She got over that feeling soon enough and took Gendry on as her best friend. Life had been a lot different when Robb, Jon, and Gendry went off to school. She had lost almost all of her best friends, aside from Hot Pie who had stayed in town to attend their local culinary program.</p><p>She smiled fondly at her childhood memories and continued to walk back home. She all but burst into a sprint when she saw that Jon&rsquo;s car was in the driveway. She searched through all the rooms downstair and bolted to the second floor. As she flung open the door to his room she yelped and covered her eyes. Gendry was inside in only his briefs sitting in the chair next to Jon&rsquo;s desk. He had his phone in his hand before he too jumped and threw it in the air. </p><p>&ldquo;Hells, Arya!&rdquo; He said clutching at his chest with one of his hands. Arya couldn&rsquo;t help it, really, she couldn&rsquo;t. Her eyes looked down at his briefs, she could feel her cheeks heating up. She averted her eyes but it was too late. Gendry had caught her staring at his underwear and he too started to blush, all the while laughing which made her blush deepen even more. Gendry ignored her discomfort and walked over to her standing right before her. He grabbed her by the waist and lifted her up into a tight hug. Arya hugged him back, forgetting about his clothing situation. She hadn&rsquo;t seen her best friend in months and she missed him dearly. She missed spending as many hours in day with him that she could. She missed the way they would fall asleep next to one another while watching a movie. She missed having him with her whenever she felt lonely. She couldn&rsquo;t count the number over people who asked them if they were dating over the years. Arya and Gendry would take turns telling people that, &ldquo;no they weren&rsquo;t a couple.&rdquo; Arya had wondered what it would be like if her and Gendry did date. She couldn&rsquo;t imagine it being much different than what they were now. They had always been affectionate with one another, but they had never kissed. They had hugged and held hands whenever it was appropriate, but never took that next step. She guessed you could say they were comfortable. When he put her down he reached into a duffle-bag and pulled out a pair of dark grey sweatpants and winked at her before pulling them on. Arya rolled her eyes but laughed. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you have there?&rdquo; Gendry asked her innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, just your Christmas present.&rdquo; Arya teased innocently, putting the bag behind her back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get it tomorrow, so just forget you saw anything.&rdquo; </p><p>Gendry chuckled and held up a poorly wrapped box. &ldquo;And I have your&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Arya didn&rsquo;t miss the way his eyes lit up when he looked at the box in his hands. She slowly backed out of Jon&rsquo;s room and into her own throwing &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow&rdquo; over her left shoulder. Sleep didn&rsquo;t come easy to her that night, but she didn&rsquo;t feel even the slightest bit tired when she woke-up in the morning.</p><p>Their family Christmas was brief, each person opening their designated gifts before they gave their parents the surprise. They were elated and went off to pack immediately since they needed to leave around mid-day. Arya and Gendry still had not exchanged their gifts though. Since she could remember they always did it separately. By the time everyone was settled down and her parents had left for their trip it was nearing four in the afternoon. Arya was sitting on her bed staring out the window to her right as she watched the snow fall gently outside. When she heard the knock on her door she suddenly got nervous. Arya never really worried about Gendry&rsquo;s present, but this year was different, something between them had changed over their separation while he was away at university. Maybe it was missing one another that put their feelings into perspective. She wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell you when it began to change, not even if she thought about it for years. </p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said faintly, her eyes still glued to the scene outside her window. Gendry entered her room and closed the door behind him with a faint click. He looked at her then, and in that moment he was sure he had never seen anything as beautiful as Arya Stark. The way she was enveloped in pure calmness just from looking at the weather outside was something out of a romance novel. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Arya turned her head towards him, her grey eyes gleaming as she looked at him. &ldquo;I felt like I haven&rsquo;t seen you all day. Are you ready for our annual gift exchange.&rdquo; </p><p>Nodding she moved and grabbed her bag from the floor of her closet. When she turned around Gendry was sitting on her bed, his legs hung off the side of her mattress. She jumped on the bed, her excitement out-weighing her nervousness. When she got herself situated with her legs criss-cross underneath her, Arya held her gift bag out to Gendry with a wide smile, a smile that would never cease to make his cheeks burn red with embarrassment at just how affected he was by her. He handed her the small box and waited for her to open it, but she just sat there staring at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Open it you stupid. I opened mine first last year it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo; Gendry huffed out a laugh and pulled the wad of tissue paper from the tiny bag. He unwrapped it slowly, making her sit in anticipation for what felt like minutes before he pulled the small ornament free. His mouth was open and his eyes were starting to water. In his hands rested a small bull which brought back memories of their first few years together. He remembered telling her the stories of how people back home would call him bull headed so he made a helmet shaped like a bull helm in his metal working class.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya, thank you. I love it.&rdquo; He smiled at her and rested his hand on top of her thigh. &ldquo;Now, please, open your present.&rdquo;</p><p>She ducked her head and began to tear the festive paper from the small box she held in her hands. When she had removed the top her heat began to beat faster and faster. The box was small and looked like it held some type of jewelry. Gendry knew she tended not to wear such girly things, and she was worried that she would need to pretend to like whatever was in the box. But, as she removed the lid she was overwhelmed at the beauty of the small bracelet inside. There was a metal wolf looked to be forged from obsidian held in the center by two thin straps of leather.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; Gendry asked as he scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. &ldquo;I know you aren&rsquo;t a big fan of jewelry, but I was messing around in my metal working class and made the wolf. I knew I wanted to give it to you for Christmas, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure how. So, I attached it to a stip of leather and figured I&rsquo;d give it to you as a bracelet. If you don&rsquo;t like it I-&rdquo; </p><p>Gendry was cut off as she leapt into his arms, her face buried into his neck. &ldquo;I love it. Now help me put it on!&rdquo; </p><p>He took the bracelet from the box and unhooked the small clasp he added to the back. He took her small wrist in his hand and clasped his piece gently, his fingers lingering on her skin a few second too long. She looked at him then and grabbed his hand. &ldquo;Gendry, I&rsquo;ve never gotten any gift that compares to this. Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p>He smiled down at her scooting across the bed to lay his head on the pillow next to her. It took only a minute for her to rest her head on his chest, ignoring the butterflies in his belly he wrapped his arm around her. He looked down at her then and he knew he would never want to leave this moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Gendry.&rdquo;</p></p>",
