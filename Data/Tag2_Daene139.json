Martin has been inspired by many different schools of thought. \u00a0This ranges from the obvious and acknowledged influences of the history of the War of the Roses, various world mythologies and literary inspiration like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</i> and the poetry of Robert Frost to name just a few. \u00a0There are numerous others including ones that I would never recognize.\u00a0 However, this essay is about none of those.\u00a0 Instead it is about one literary influence I recently discovered while reading the book, which I\u00a0have not previously seen discussed.</p><p>As a fan of science fiction and fantasy, there are some books of the genre that I am almost ashamed to say that I have never read. \u00a0Until a recently, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> was one such book for me. \u00a0Thankfully, two weeks ago I was able to scratch it off of my list of things to do as I finally read the story that has inspired and scared so many fans over the years.\u00a0 And as I read it, I was shocked but not surprised at the number of symbolic parallels between it and ASOIAF\u2014 specifically the arc of Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>Some of you may be<i> </i>familiar with Wells\u2019 classic story either from reading the book or watching one of the many movie versions, including the Tom Cruise one from a few years ago. \u00a0Unlike in the movie, the Martians in the book don\u2019t land in NJ or any other American City. \u00a0Instead, the invasion begins in a sand pit on Horsell Common in Surrey England. The quote I mentioned above is from the actual book and a soldier says it to the nameless protagonist as they hide out in a house right outside London to evade the alien invaders. </p><p>The parallels between Martin\u2019s world of fiery dragons, and the H.G. Wells classic tale of invaders from Mars are plentiful. \u00a0In this article I will take a look at the similarities between the two books and discuss what it might suggest about Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s final arc.</p><!-- more --><p>On the surface, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> is a science fiction story about alien invaders from Mars who land in England and attempt a takeover of the earth. However, if you look below the obvious, Wells\u2019 story is actually an anti-imperialistic treatise on England. \u00a0While a classic of the genre, there is also inherent racism and sexism on display as Wells who would have been considered a liberal of his time still thought of people of different races as inferior to Europeans and presented females as flighty and of lesser intelligence. \u00a0Yet he recognized the devastation the English brought to the people of other countries via their practice of colonialism.</p><p>At the time of its publication in 1897, Britain was at the height of its imperialistic power and it truly was the empire \u201con which the sun never set.\u201d \u00a0Wells, like Martin was a pacifist and he wrote a novel that placed England on the other side of the coin where it was not the conquering nation but rather the country being invaded and whose people were being killed, subjugated, and culture destroyed.</p><blockquote><p>And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them.</p><p>And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Eve of the War</b></p></blockquote><p>One of the most influential books of all time, the story was written by Wells over 125 years ago. \u00a0The novel has influenced artists across multiple genres including film, literature and many of the sciences as little boys and girls look to the stars and wonder, what if? \u00a0It was also eerily prescient on the tactics of future warfare.</p><blockquote><p>As noted by Howard Black: &ldquo;In concrete details the Martian Fighting Machines as depicted by Wells have nothing in common with tanks or dive bombers, but the tactical and strategic use made of them is strikingly reminiscent of Blitzkrieg as it would be developed by the German armed forces four decades later. The description of the Martians advancing inexorably, at lightning speed, towards London; the British Army completely unable to put up an effective resistance; the British government disintegrating and evacuating the capital; the mass of terrified refugees clogging the roads, all were to be precisely enacted in real life at 1940 France.&rdquo; </p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds%22%20%5Cl%20%22Scientific_predictions_and_accuracy\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wikipedia</b></a><b> </b><b> \u00a0</b></p></blockquote><p>The Martian\u2019s use of Black Smoke also heralded the real life use of chemical weapons several years after the publication of the book by the Germans during WWI. \u00a0And their Heat-Ray inspired the invention of the laser several decades later. \u00a0Much of the scientific theories about possible life on Mars proposed in the book have since been proven to be false. \u00a0Nonetheless, it has not lessened the influence of the book or curb the imagination of its fans that believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p><p>Now you probably think that I\u2019m about to talk about the aliens playing a role in ASOIAF and if so, you are completely wrong. \u00a0This essay is in fact primarily about the most mundane of earthly creatures\u2014ants. \u00a0Not to say that objects from space don\u2019t play a role in both H.G. Wells timeless story and Martin\u2019s modern classic. \u00a0They do and so I should probably talk about them briefly before I move on to the main topic of ants. \u00a0</p><p>As with the Targaryen\u2019s dragons, the famous Martians invaders from <i>The War of the Worlds</i> are associated with both a pit and meteors. The Targaryen dragons were housed in the dragon pit below the Red Keep and of course, Dany locked Rhaegal and Viserion in one beneath Meereen. </p><p>The landing site of the first Martian \u201cship\u201d in the Wells\u2019 story was in the sand pit at Horsell Common. \u00a0Subsequent landings each created a pit on impact. \u00a0And like the dragon pit does for the fiery creatures in ASOIAF, the ones in <i>The War of the Worlds</i> serves as the home base for the Martians when they are not out killing earthlings with their Heat-Ray. \u00a0It is also in the pit that they built their machines of mass destruction.\u00a0 Later, I will have more to say about the symbolic importances of the pit in both books but for now, let\u2019s move on.</p><p>The Martians journeyed to earth not in what today\u2019s audience would expect to see in a spaceship but rather in a cylinder that is shot from their home planet directly to the earth. \u00a0Don\u2019t forget that the book was first published in 1897 and flying saucers; spaceships and warp speed were not yet part of the lexicon. The cylinder bearing the Martians as would be expected was thought to be just another meteor as it entered the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The citizens of England soon discover that the falling star they saw in their night sky was in fact not a meteor but actually a cylinder bearing invaders from Mars.</p><p>In ASOIAF, there are suggestions that the Qartheen myth told to Dany by her handmaiden is actually about a meteor shower hitting the earth and causing the Long Night. \u00a0And no, I\u2019m not saying that dragons come from outer space. \u00a0We, the readers are not yet sure what brought dragons into the world of Planetos. Are they creatures of evolution or were they created in some manner by one of the ancient races of the East\u2026possibly the Great Empire of the Dawn? The answer is not yet known but the Qartheen myth told to Dany offers up one explanation. \u00a0</p><p>The ancient Qarthians quite possibly built their legend of the origins of dragons around an in-world meteor shower. \u00a0Other cultures including those in Westeros developed different myths based on the same celestial event. \u00a0In the case of the Westerosi, their legend is of the Children of the Forest calling down the Hammer of the Waters. \u00a0Only time and George will tell whether there was a magical component to the meteor shower or whether it was a natural occurring event.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No dragon,&rdquo; Irri said. &ldquo;Brave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It is known.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is known,&rdquo; agreed Jhiqui.</p><p>&ldquo;A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,&rdquo; blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed their father&rsquo;s khalasar. Doreah was older, almost twenty. Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys.</p><p>Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. &ldquo;The moon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,&rdquo; the Lysene girl said. &ldquo;Once there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.&rdquo;</p><p>The two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed. &ldquo;You are foolish strawhead slave,&rdquo; Irri said. &ldquo;Moon is no egg. Moon is god, woman wife of sun. It is known.\u201d</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys III</b></p></blockquote><p>As was first suggested by Lucifer Means Lightbringer in his seminal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6H7ZcZlUL8&amp;list=PLEHvft-cyPmDWPIXUhJhL0F61vIw2nuS0\" target=\"_blank\">Bloodstone Compendium</a> series of essays, the description of the moon wandering too close to the sun and dragons pouring forth is quite possibly a descriptive way of saying there was a meteor shower. \u00a0This event was also possibly the cause of the Long Night as the metaphorical description of dragons eating the fire of the sun suggests that the celestial light it gives off was hidden from the world. \u00a0I find this symbolic association of dragons with the potential cause of the Long Night quite interesting because dragons potentially playing a role in this catastrophic event whether literally or metaphorically cannot be a positive. \u00a0However, this essay is not about the Long Night but rather about the symbolism surrounding Dany and her dragons that echoes that of the Martians invaders in Wells\u2019 story.</p><p>Like Martin\u2019s dragons, Wells\u2019 Martians are strongly associated with fire, snakes and meteors. \u00a0There are actually several meteor strikes at the heart of <i>The War of the Worlds</i>.\u00a0 To be precise, there are 10 strikes.\u00a0 When the initial Martian machine lands in England, the locals and officials thought it was a meteor until they investigated and saw it was an object shaped by metal. But these meteors brought with them alien invaders instead of dragons. </p><blockquote><p>Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, <b>a line of flame high in the atmosphere</b>. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p><b>Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound</b>. I myself heard nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Falling Star </b></p></blockquote><p>Hmmm, a falling star described as a flame streaking across the sky. \u00a0Now where have we seen a similar description? \u00a0Perhaps it was the comet that was seen over Planetos\u2026only that streak was red while in <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, it is green.</p><blockquote><p>The morning of King Joffrey&rsquo;s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. &quot;What do you think it means?&rdquo; she asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Glory to your betrothed,&rdquo; Ser Arys answered at once. &ldquo;<b>See how it flames across the sky today</b> on His Grace&rsquo;s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey&rsquo;s Comet.\u201d</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Sansa I</b></p></blockquote><p>Old Nan told Bran that the coming of the comet meant dragons and as is usually the case, she was right. \u00a0It was more about symbolism but Dany\u2019s dragons were born into the world on a night when the comet was seen in the sky over the Dothraki Sea. \u00a0And just as the comet heralded the birth of dragons into the world again on Planetos, the falling star with the hissing snake like sound of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> brought to England a dragon of a different sort.</p><blockquote><p>Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, <b>the Gorgon groups of tentacles</b>, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth\u2014above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes\u2014were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Cylinder Opens</b></p></blockquote><p>The Martians look nothing like our ideas of dragons and are not referred to as such. They are literally just a big brain with snake like tentacles\u00a0reminiscent of an Octopus.\u00a0 They build for themselves protective armor with tripod legs that allows them to move around in the heavier earth gravity.\u00a0 \u00a0However, while they look nothing like our ideas of dragons, surprisingly there are several symbolic comparisons. \u00a0This entails the many snakes like allusions such as the one to a Gorgon, which refers to any of the three sisters from Greek mythology whose hair is made of living serpents. \u00a0And in ASOIAF, George often uses snake like symbolism to refer to dragons.

The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a <b>thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Falling Star</b></p><p><b>\u2014-</b></p><p>The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in then same position.

When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce \u2026 and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. <b>The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales</b>, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, <b>they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun</b>.</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys II</b></p></blockquote><p>One can argue that the cylinder is to the Martians what Dany\u2019s eggs are to her dragon children\u2014an outer layer that offers protection to develop prior to their birth into the world. \u00a0The earthlings hear a banging from inside the meteor/cylinder and initially think that their Martian visitors are trapped inside and need help. They soon find out that is definitely not the case and that it was simply the Martians preparing for their symbolic birth into the world of man.</p><blockquote><p>I think everyone expected to see a man emerge\u2014possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks\u2014like eyes. Then something resembling <b>a little grey snake</b>, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me\u2014and then another.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.</p><p>Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Cylinder Opens</b></p></blockquote><p>The creatures re-enter the cylinder but shortly later they again make an appearance. \u00a0This time, the humans find out that they are not dealing with your friendly neighborhood Martians when the invaders introduce the earthlings to their heat ray. \u00a0</p><p>The fact that the Martians are compared to snakes and that the their arrival is in a cylinder that was originally believed to be a meteor echoes in ASOIAF but are these similarities sufficient on which to build a comparative study? Possibly not! The same might even be said of the scaly description of their cylinder home. In fact, I would probably have ignored these similarities if not for some other ones in play, most notably that like dragon and their fire, the Martian Heat-Ray is compared to a flaming sword in the sky and of course the ants&hellip;the central focus of this essay.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"502\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b06d88d5e87d2159229a25f5432d1d3/tumblr_inline_pml6dqoR2k1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"502\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Illustration for the 1906 edition of War of the Worlds by Henrique Alvim Corr\u00eaa<br/></p></blockquote><p>Let\u2019s now look at some more of the similarities between the descriptions Wells uses depict the Martians and their heat-ray and how George describes Dany\u2019s dragons.<br/></p><blockquote><p>It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily<b>, this flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I</b> perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir. <b>I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled</b>. Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common. <b>Forthwith the hissing and humming ceased</b>, and the black, domelike object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.</p><p>All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise. But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: \u00a0The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>Here is another comparison of the Heat-Ray to a sword.</p><blockquote><p>For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; <b>that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: How I Reached Home </b></p></blockquote><p>The narrator of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> likened the Martian heat-ray to a flaming sword of death and here is Xaro comparing Dany\u2019s dragon to a sword in a similar manner. \u00a0Do you think it\u2019s possible that Wells\u2019 description of the Martians and their heat-ray was George\u2019s was inspiration for depicting the dragons in such a manner? \u00a0I certainly think that\u2019s a strong possibility.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,&rdquo; Xaro went on, &ldquo;but Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, &lsquo;She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.&rsquo; When your dragons were small they were a wonder. <b>Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world</b>.&rdquo; He wiped away the tears. &ldquo;I should have slain you in Qarth.\u201d</p><p><b>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys III</b></p></blockquote><p>Like the Targaryen dragons, the Martians also produce different color fire or smoke and one in particular\u2014the Black Smoke that appears later in the story is extra deadly as it seems to be some type of chemical weapon. \u00a0Also, please note the symbolic reference to three distinct puffs of smoke just prior to the heat-ray being used for the first time. After seeing all the other similarities to dragons, one can\u2019t help but think of Dany\u2019s three children</p><blockquote><p><b>Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs</b>, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.</p><p><b>This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead</b> and the hazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><b>Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming</b>, into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.</p><p>Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men. <b>It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.</b> It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>The passages that cover the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons are too long to post but I want to include a section where you see how the birth of the Martians and the reveal of their fiery power has the same feel. \u00a0Keep in mind that a horse which the narrator hears squeal is associated with the birth of the Martians, there is also one at the scene for the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons as her Bloodrider Aggo kills a stallion to be used as a sacrifice in the pyre. \u00a0This horse is meant to symbolize Drogo\u2019s stallion that he will ride into the afterworld. </p><blockquote><p>Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, shriller \u2026 then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony.</p><p>And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany&rsquo;s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever.</p><p>She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur&rsquo;s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.</p><p>________</p><p>Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant <b>she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing</b>.<b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X </b><br/></p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X </b></p></blockquote><p>The inclusion of the horse in the dragon birthing scene locked in my belief that George wrote the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons to echo that of the Martians.\u00a0 Just as a horse was burnt to death in the Martian birthing scene, the same was the case with the birth of the dragons.\u00a0 Although to be fair, Dany had the horse killed before it was added to the pyre.</p><p>And does not her vision of Khal Drogo and his flaming lash remind you of this passage from when the Heat-Ray first appeared.</p><blockquote><p><b>Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediatel</b>y withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion. What could be going on there?</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>You\u2019ve seen from the excerpts I\u2019ve posted that with his use of descriptive language, Wells wants you to think of the Martians as snakes. The Targaryens and their dragons are also often compared to snakes. \u00a0Here are just a few of those passages in question.</p><blockquote><p>Only dragons and men eat cooked meat, he had said.</p><p>When she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black, <b>the dragons ripped at it eagerly, their heads striking like snakes</b>.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Daenerys I</b></p><p><b>\u2014\u2014</b></p><p>Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering, and the sounds grew faintly louder. <b>Drogon&rsquo;s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream</b>, steam rising from between his teeth. He hears it too. Dany turned to the blank wall once more, but there was nothing. Could there be a secret door, a door I cannot see? Another torch went out. Another. The first door on the right, he said, always the first door on the right. The first door on the right &hellip;</p><p>It came to her suddenly&hellip; . is the last door on the left!</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Daenerys IV</b></p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>&quot;\u2026 don&rsquo;t want to wake the dragon, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>Viserys stood before her, screaming. &ldquo;The dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. I am the dragon, and I will be crowned.&rdquo; The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh. &ldquo;<b>I am the dragon and I will be crowned!&rdquo; he shrieked, and his fingers snapped like snakes</b>, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks.</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys IX</b></p></blockquote><p>I also mentioned that there was a Black Smoke or poisonous gas used by the Martians to kill the humans in mass. \u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at how Wells describes it to see if anything seems familiar.</p><blockquote><p>We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us.</p><p>A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate\u2019s hand as he fled out of the front room. <b>When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it. </b></p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: Underfoot</b></p></blockquote><p>We see the after effect of the Black Smoke described as a black snowstorm. Did you notice how again Wells reinforces the comparison of the Martians to snake with the hissing reference?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1154\" data-orig-height=\"648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b87a494883647a7c48639cd0cdbc497/tumblr_inline_pmo6s0CV9A1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1154\" data-orig-height=\"648\"/></figure><p>Having watched <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, the black snowstorm reminded me of the scene from Dany\u2019s vision of her walking in the throne room of the Red Keep. Snow is falling around her but with her Targaryen heritage, we the audience are never sure whether we are meant to interpret it as snow or ashes.</p><p>Here is another scene involving the Black Smoke that reinforces its comparison to ashes and which suggests that maybe that is exactly how we should be interpreting the snow in her vision. \u00a0This time, Wells uses fiery language to describe the after effects of the smoke as cindery powder. He then goes further comparing the landscape to Pompeii, which automatically makes one think of the destruction of Old Valyria and Harrenhal.</p><blockquote><p>In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all <b>covered thickly with black dust</b>. <b>That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: Underfoot</b> </p></blockquote><p>The above description of bodies covered in ashes also makes me remember the dead bodies Tyrion passed on the Field of Fire that were nothing more than ashes. In addition to Valyria and Harrenhal, one must consider the eventual burning of Kings Landing by Dany that\u2019s been foreshadowed in both the books and show. The result will definitely look like a modern day Pompeii.</p><p>The Martians even built machines that flew and the descriptive language Wells uses to describe the scene made me think of how Belarion and Drogon are depicted when their wings are fully extended. Note also that this scene takes place when the invaders attack a group of ships on the river, which of course brings to mind the upcoming Battle of Fire in Meereen.</p><blockquote><p>Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. <b>A mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun</b>.

Wells classic tale of invaders from Mars are plentiful. \u00a0In this article I will take a look at the similarities between the two books and discuss what it might suggest about Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s final arc.</p>[[MORE]]<p>On the surface, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> is a science fiction story about alien invaders from Mars who land in England and attempt a takeover of the earth. However, if you look below the obvious, Wells\u2019 story is actually an anti-imperialistic treatise on England. \u00a0While a classic of the genre, there is also inherent racism and sexism on display as Wells who would have been considered a liberal of his time still thought of people of different races as inferior to Europeans and presented females as flighty and of lesser intelligence. \u00a0Yet he recognized the devastation the English brought to the people of other countries via their practice of colonialism.</p><p>At the time of its publication in 1897, Britain was at the height of its imperialistic power and it truly was the empire \u201con which the sun never set.\u201d \u00a0Wells, like Martin was a pacifist and he wrote a novel that placed England on the other side of the coin where it was not the conquering nation but rather the country being invaded and whose people were being killed, subjugated, and culture destroyed.</p><blockquote><p>And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them.</p><p>And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Eve of the War</b></p></blockquote><p>One of the most influential books of all time, the story was written by Wells over 125 years ago. \u00a0The novel has influenced artists across multiple genres including film, literature and many of the sciences as little boys and girls look to the stars and wonder, what if? \u00a0It was also eerily prescient on the tactics of future warfare.</p><blockquote><p>As noted by Howard Black: \u201cIn concrete details the Martian Fighting Machines as depicted by Wells have nothing in common with tanks or dive bombers, but the tactical and strategic use made of them is strikingly reminiscent of Blitzkrieg as it would be developed by the German armed forces four decades later. The description of the Martians advancing inexorably, at lightning speed, towards London; the British Army completely unable to put up an effective resistance; the British government disintegrating and evacuating the capital; the mass of terrified refugees clogging the roads, all were to be precisely enacted in real life at 1940 France.\u201d </p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds%22%20%5Cl%20%22Scientific_predictions_and_accuracy\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wikipedia</b></a><b> </b><b> \u00a0</b></p></blockquote><p>The Martian\u2019s use of Black Smoke also heralded the real life use of chemical weapons several years after the publication of the book by the Germans during WWI. \u00a0And their Heat-Ray inspired the invention of the laser several decades later. \u00a0Much of the scientific theories about possible life on Mars proposed in the book have since been proven to be false. \u00a0Nonetheless, it has not lessened the influence of the book or curb the imagination of its fans that believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p><p>Now you probably think that I\u2019m about to talk about the aliens playing a role in ASOIAF and if so, you are completely wrong. \u00a0This essay is in fact primarily about the most mundane of earthly creatures\u2014ants. \u00a0Not to say that objects from space don\u2019t play a role in both H.G. Wells timeless story and Martin\u2019s modern classic. \u00a0They do and so I should probably talk about them briefly before I move on to the main topic of ants. \u00a0</p><p>As with the Targaryen\u2019s dragons, the famous Martians invaders from <i>The War of the Worlds</i> are associated with both a pit and meteors. The Targaryen dragons were housed in the dragon pit below the Red Keep and of course, Dany locked Rhaegal and Viserion in one beneath Meereen. </p><p>The landing site of the first Martian \u201cship\u201d in the Wells\u2019 story was in the sand pit at Horsell Common. \u00a0Subsequent landings each created a pit on impact. \u00a0And like the dragon pit does for the fiery creatures in ASOIAF, the ones in <i>The War of the Worlds</i> serves as the home base for the Martians when they are not out killing earthlings with their Heat-Ray. \u00a0It is also in the pit that they built their machines of mass destruction.\u00a0 Later, I will have more to say about the symbolic importances of the pit in both books but for now, let\u2019s move on.</p><p>The Martians journeyed to earth not in what today\u2019s audience would expect to see in a spaceship but rather in a cylinder that is shot from their home planet directly to the earth. \u00a0Don\u2019t forget that the book was first published in 1897 and flying saucers; spaceships and warp speed were not yet part of the lexicon. The cylinder bearing the Martians as would be expected was thought to be just another meteor as it entered the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The citizens of England soon discover that the falling star they saw in their night sky was in fact not a meteor but actually a cylinder bearing invaders from Mars.</p><p>In ASOIAF, there are suggestions that the Qartheen myth told to Dany by her handmaiden is actually about a meteor shower hitting the earth and causing the Long Night. \u00a0And no, I\u2019m not saying that dragons come from outer space. \u00a0We, the readers are not yet sure what brought dragons into the world of Planetos. Are they creatures of evolution or were they created in some manner by one of the ancient races of the East\u2026possibly the Great Empire of the Dawn? The answer is not yet known but the Qartheen myth told to Dany offers up one explanation. \u00a0</p><p>The ancient Qarthians quite possibly built their legend of the origins of dragons around an in-world meteor shower. \u00a0Other cultures including those in Westeros developed different myths based on the same celestial event. \u00a0In the case of the Westerosi, their legend is of the Children of the Forest calling down the Hammer of the Waters. \u00a0Only time and George will tell whether there was a magical component to the meteor shower or whether it was a natural occurring event.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo dragon,\u201d Irri said. \u201cBrave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It is known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is known,\u201d agreed Jhiqui.</p><p>\u201cA trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,\u201d blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed their father\u2019s khalasar. Doreah was older, almost twenty. Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys.</p><p>Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. \u201cThe moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,\u201d the Lysene girl said. \u201cOnce there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.\u201d</p><p>The two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed. \u201cYou are foolish strawhead slave,\u201d Irri said. \u201cMoon is no egg. Moon is god, woman wife of sun. It is known.\u201d</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys III</b></p></blockquote><p>As was first suggested by Lucifer Means Lightbringer in his seminal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6H7ZcZlUL8&amp;list=PLEHvft-cyPmDWPIXUhJhL0F61vIw2nuS0\" target=\"_blank\">Bloodstone Compendium</a> series of essays, the description of the moon wandering too close to the sun and dragons pouring forth is quite possibly a descriptive way of saying there was a meteor shower. \u00a0This event was also possibly the cause of the Long Night as the metaphorical description of dragons eating the fire of the sun suggests that the celestial light it gives off was hidden from the world. \u00a0I find this symbolic association of dragons with the potential cause of the Long Night quite interesting because dragons potentially playing a role in this catastrophic event whether literally or metaphorically cannot be a positive. \u00a0However, this essay is not about the Long Night but rather about the symbolism surrounding Dany and her dragons that echoes that of the Martians invaders in Wells\u2019 story.</p><p>Like Martin\u2019s dragons, Wells\u2019 Martians are strongly associated with fire, snakes and meteors. \u00a0There are actually several meteor strikes at the heart of <i>The War of the Worlds</i>.\u00a0 To be precise, there are 10 strikes.\u00a0 When the initial Martian machine lands in England, the locals and officials thought it was a meteor until they investigated and saw it was an object shaped by metal. But these meteors brought with them alien invaders instead of dragons. </p><blockquote><p>Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, <b>a line of flame high in the atmosphere</b>. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p><b>Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound</b>. I myself heard nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Falling Star </b></p></blockquote><p>Hmmm, a falling star described as a flame streaking across the sky. \u00a0Now where have we seen a similar description? \u00a0Perhaps it was the comet that was seen over Planetos\u2026only that streak was red while in <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, it is green.</p><blockquote><p>The morning of King Joffrey\u2019s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. \"What do you think it means?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cGlory to your betrothed,\u201d Ser Arys answered at once. \u201c<b>See how it flames across the sky today</b> on His Grace\u2019s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey\u2019s Comet.\u201d</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Sansa I</b></p></blockquote><p>Old Nan told Bran that the coming of the comet meant dragons and as is usually the case, she was right. \u00a0It was more about symbolism but Dany\u2019s dragons were born into the world on a night when the comet was seen in the sky over the Dothraki Sea. \u00a0And just as the comet heralded the birth of dragons into the world again on Planetos, the falling star with the hissing snake like sound of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> brought to England a dragon of a different sort.</p><blockquote><p>Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, <b>the Gorgon groups of tentacles</b>, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth\u2014above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes\u2014were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Cylinder Opens</b></p></blockquote><p>The Martians look nothing like our ideas of dragons and are not referred to as such. They are literally just a big brain with snake like tentacles\u00a0reminiscent of an Octopus.\u00a0 They build for themselves protective armor with tripod legs that allows them to move around in the heavier earth gravity.\u00a0 \u00a0However, while they look nothing like our ideas of dragons, surprisingly there are several symbolic comparisons. \u00a0This entails the many snakes like allusions such as the one to a Gorgon, which refers to any of the three sisters from Greek mythology whose hair is made of living serpents. \u00a0And in ASOIAF, George often uses snake like symbolism to refer to dragons. The Gorgons\u2014three heads of the dragon as it were.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1058\" data-orig-height=\"1367\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fe3e3ff6202a2b74f23d116c35baf66/tumblr_inline_pn1qw5Sj0N1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1058\" data-orig-height=\"1367\"></figure><blockquote><p>Illustration by Frank R.

The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a <b>thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Falling Star</b></p><p><b>\u2014-</b></p><p>The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in then same position. But now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder. <b>Air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.</b></p><p>They listened, <b>rapped on the scaly burnt metal</b> with a stick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead.</p></blockquote><p>As Alice would be wont to say, things are getting \u201ccuriouser and curiouser\u201d because it just so happens that George also describes the scales of Dany\u2019s dragon eggs as looking like metal. </p><blockquote><p>Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce \u2026 and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. <b>The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales</b>, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, <b>they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun</b>.</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys II</b></p></blockquote><p>One can argue that the cylinder is to the Martians what Dany\u2019s eggs are to her dragon children\u2014an outer layer that offers protection to develop prior to their birth into the world. \u00a0The earthlings hear a banging from inside the meteor/cylinder and initially think that their Martian visitors are trapped inside and need help. They soon find out that is definitely not the case and that it was simply the Martians preparing for their symbolic birth into the world of man.</p><blockquote><p>I think everyone expected to see a man emerge\u2014possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks\u2014like eyes. Then something resembling <b>a little grey snake</b>, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me\u2014and then another.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.</p><p>Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Cylinder Opens</b></p></blockquote><p>The creatures re-enter the cylinder but shortly later they again make an appearance. \u00a0This time, the humans find out that they are not dealing with your friendly neighborhood Martians when the invaders introduce the earthlings to their heat ray. \u00a0</p><p>The fact that the Martians are compared to snakes and that the their arrival is in a cylinder that was originally believed to be a meteor echoes in ASOIAF but are these similarities sufficient on which to build a comparative study? Possibly not! The same might even be said of the scaly description of their cylinder home. In fact, I would probably have ignored these similarities if not for some other ones in play, most notably that like dragon and their fire, the Martian Heat-Ray is compared to a flaming sword in the sky and of course the ants\u2026the central focus of this essay.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"502\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b06d88d5e87d2159229a25f5432d1d3/tumblr_inline_pml6dqoR2k1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"502\"></figure><blockquote><p>Illustration for the 1906 edition of War of the Worlds by Henrique Alvim Corr\u00eaa<br></p></blockquote><p>Let\u2019s now look at some more of the similarities between the descriptions Wells uses depict the Martians and their heat-ray and how George describes Dany\u2019s dragons.<br></p><blockquote><p>It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily<b>, this flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I</b> perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir. <b>I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled</b>. Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common. <b>Forthwith the hissing and humming ceased</b>, and the black, domelike object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.</p><p>All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise. But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: \u00a0The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>Here is another comparison of the Heat-Ray to a sword.</p><blockquote><p>For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; <b>that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: How I Reached Home </b></p></blockquote><p>The narrator of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> likened the Martian heat-ray to a flaming sword of death and here is Xaro comparing Dany\u2019s dragon to a sword in a similar manner. \u00a0Do you think it\u2019s possible that Wells\u2019 description of the Martians and their heat-ray was George\u2019s was inspiration for depicting the dragons in such a manner? \u00a0I certainly think that\u2019s a strong possibility.</p><blockquote><p>\"When I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,\u201d Xaro went on, \u201cbut Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, \u2018She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.\u2019 When your dragons were small they were a wonder. <b>Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world</b>.\u201d He wiped away the tears. \u201cI should have slain you in Qarth.\u201d</p><p><b>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys III</b></p></blockquote><p>Like the Targaryen dragons, the Martians also produce different color fire or smoke and one in particular\u2014the Black Smoke that appears later in the story is extra deadly as it seems to be some type of chemical weapon. \u00a0Also, please note the symbolic reference to three distinct puffs of smoke just prior to the heat-ray being used for the first time. After seeing all the other similarities to dragons, one can\u2019t help but think of Dany\u2019s three children</p><blockquote><p><b>Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs</b>, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.</p><p><b>This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead</b> and the hazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><b>Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming</b>, into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.</p><p>Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men. <b>It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.</b> It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>The passages that cover the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons are too long to post but I want to include a section where you see how the birth of the Martians and the reveal of their fiery power has the same feel. \u00a0Keep in mind that a horse which the narrator hears squeal is associated with the birth of the Martians, there is also one at the scene for the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons as her Bloodrider Aggo kills a stallion to be used as a sacrifice in the pyre. \u00a0This horse is meant to symbolize Drogo\u2019s stallion that he will ride into the afterworld. </p><blockquote><p>Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, shriller \u2026 then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony.</p><p>And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany\u2019s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever.</p><p>She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur\u2019s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.</p><p>________</p><p>Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant <b>she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing</b>.<b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X </b><br></p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X </b></p></blockquote><p>The inclusion of the horse in the dragon birthing scene locked in my belief that George wrote the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons to echo that of the Martians.\u00a0 Just as a horse was burnt to death in the Martian birthing scene, the same was the case with the birth of the dragons.\u00a0 Although to be fair, Dany had the horse killed before it was added to the pyre.</p><p>And does not her vision of Khal Drogo and his flaming lash remind you of this passage from when the Heat-Ray first appeared.</p><blockquote><p><b>Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediatel</b>y withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion. What could be going on there?</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>You\u2019ve seen from the excerpts I\u2019ve posted that with his use of descriptive language, Wells wants you to think of the Martians as snakes. The Targaryens and their dragons are also often compared to snakes. \u00a0Here are just a few of those passages in question.</p><blockquote><p>Only dragons and men eat cooked meat, he had said.</p><p>When she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black, <b>the dragons ripped at it eagerly, their heads striking like snakes</b>.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Daenerys I</b></p><p><b>\u2014\u2014</b></p><p>Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering, and the sounds grew faintly louder. <b>Drogon\u2019s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream</b>, steam rising from between his teeth. He hears it too. Dany turned to the blank wall once more, but there was nothing. Could there be a secret door, a door I cannot see? Another torch went out. Another. The first door on the right, he said, always the first door on the right. The first door on the right \u2026</p><p>It came to her suddenly\u2026 . is the last door on the left!</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Daenerys IV</b></p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>\"\u2026 don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?\u201d</p><p>Viserys stood before her, screaming. \u201cThe dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. I am the dragon, and I will be crowned.\u201d The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh. \u201c<b>I am the dragon and I will be crowned!\u201d he shrieked, and his fingers snapped like snakes</b>, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks.</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys IX</b></p></blockquote><p>I also mentioned that there was a Black Smoke or poisonous gas used by the Martians to kill the humans in mass. \u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at how Wells describes it to see if anything seems familiar.</p><blockquote><p>We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us.</p><p>A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate\u2019s hand as he fled out of the front room. <b>When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it. </b></p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: Underfoot</b></p></blockquote><p>We see the after effect of the Black Smoke described as a black snowstorm. Did you notice how again Wells reinforces the comparison of the Martians to snake with the hissing reference?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1154\" data-orig-height=\"648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b87a494883647a7c48639cd0cdbc497/tumblr_inline_pmo6s0CV9A1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1154\" data-orig-height=\"648\"></figure><p>Having watched <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, the black snowstorm reminded me of the scene from Dany\u2019s vision of her walking in the throne room of the Red Keep. Snow is falling around her but with her Targaryen heritage, we the audience are never sure whether we are meant to interpret it as snow or ashes.</p><p>Here is another scene involving the Black Smoke that reinforces its comparison to ashes and which suggests that maybe that is exactly how we should be interpreting the snow in her vision. \u00a0This time, Wells uses fiery language to describe the after effects of the smoke as cindery powder. He then goes further comparing the landscape to Pompeii, which automatically makes one think of the destruction of Old Valyria and Harrenhal.</p><blockquote><p>In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all <b>covered thickly with black dust</b>. <b>That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: Underfoot</b> </p></blockquote><p>The above description of bodies covered in ashes also makes me remember the dead bodies Tyrion passed on the Field of Fire that were nothing more than ashes. In addition to Valyria and Harrenhal, one must consider the eventual burning of Kings Landing by Dany that\u2019s been foreshadowed in both the books and show. The result will definitely look like a modern day Pompeii.</p><p>The Martians even built machines that flew and the descriptive language Wells uses to describe the scene made me think of how Belarion and Drogon are depicted when their wings are fully extended. Note also that this scene takes place when the invaders attack a group of ships on the river, which of course brings to mind the upcoming Battle of Fire in Meereen.</p><blockquote><p>Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. <b>A mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun</b>. The steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense.</p><p>The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the evening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. <b>Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness\u2014rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very large</b>, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night. <b>And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The \u201cThunder Child\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>And here is Dany\u2019s description of Drogon as she sees him from afar as she wonders the Dothraki Sea.</p><blockquote><p>Thrice that day she caught sight of Drogon. Once he was so far off that he might have been an <b>eagle</b>, slipping in and out of distant clouds, but Dany knew the look of him by now, even when he was no more than a speck. <b>The second time he passed before the sun, his black wings spread, and the world darkened</b>.</p><p><b>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys X</b></p></blockquote><p>Here we come to the end of part one. In the next chapter, we get to the heart of the essay when we discuss eatable ants and what Wells use of the metaphor in <i>The War of the Worlds</i> and George\u2019s in the same manner in <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> portends for the final arc of Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>Read part 2 <b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182728166641/daenerys-targaryen-martians-eatable-ants-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></b>!</p>",

Martin has been inspired by many different schools of thought. \u00a0This ranges from the obvious and acknowledged influences of the history of the War of the Roses, various world mythologies and literary inspiration like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</i> and the poetry of Robert Frost to name just a few. \u00a0There are numerous others including ones that I would never recognize.\u00a0 However, this essay is about none of those.\u00a0 Instead it is about one literary influence I recently discovered while reading the book, which I\u00a0have not previously seen discussed.</p><p>As a fan of science fiction and fantasy, there are some books of the genre that I am almost ashamed to say that I have never read. \u00a0Until a recently, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> was one such book for me. \u00a0Thankfully, two weeks ago I was able to scratch it off of my list of things to do as I finally read the story that has inspired and scared so many fans over the years.\u00a0 And as I read it, I was shocked but not surprised at the number of symbolic parallels between it and ASOIAF\u2014 specifically the arc of Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>Some of you may be<i> </i>familiar with Wells\u2019 classic story either from reading the book or watching one of the many movie versions, including the Tom Cruise one from a few years ago. \u00a0Unlike in the movie, the Martians in the book don\u2019t land in NJ or any other American City. \u00a0Instead, the invasion begins in a sand pit on Horsell Common in Surrey England. The quote I mentioned above is from the actual book and a soldier says it to the nameless protagonist as they hide out in a house right outside London to evade the alien invaders. </p><p>The parallels between Martin\u2019s world of fiery dragons, and the H.G. Wells classic tale of invaders from Mars are plentiful. \u00a0In this article I will take a look at the similarities between the two books and discuss what it might suggest about Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s final arc.</p>[[MORE]]<p>On the surface, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> is a science fiction story about alien invaders from Mars who land in England and attempt a takeover of the earth. However, if you look below the obvious, Wells\u2019 story is actually an anti-imperialistic treatise on England. \u00a0While a classic of the genre, there is also inherent racism and sexism on display as Wells who would have been considered a liberal of his time still thought of people of different races as inferior to Europeans and presented females as flighty and of lesser intelligence. \u00a0Yet he recognized the devastation the English brought to the people of other countries via their practice of colonialism.</p><p>At the time of its publication in 1897, Britain was at the height of its imperialistic power and it truly was the empire \u201con which the sun never set.\u201d \u00a0Wells, like Martin was a pacifist and he wrote a novel that placed England on the other side of the coin where it was not the conquering nation but rather the country being invaded and whose people were being killed, subjugated, and culture destroyed.</p><blockquote><p>And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them.</p><p>And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Eve of the War</b></p></blockquote><p>One of the most influential books of all time, the story was written by Wells over 125 years ago. \u00a0The novel has influenced artists across multiple genres including film, literature and many of the sciences as little boys and girls look to the stars and wonder, what if? \u00a0It was also eerily prescient on the tactics of future warfare.</p><blockquote><p>As noted by Howard Black: \u201cIn concrete details the Martian Fighting Machines as depicted by Wells have nothing in common with tanks or dive bombers, but the tactical and strategic use made of them is strikingly reminiscent of Blitzkrieg as it would be developed by the German armed forces four decades later. The description of the Martians advancing inexorably, at lightning speed, towards London; the British Army completely unable to put up an effective resistance; the British government disintegrating and evacuating the capital; the mass of terrified refugees clogging the roads, all were to be precisely enacted in real life at 1940 France.\u201d </p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds%22%20%5Cl%20%22Scientific_predictions_and_accuracy\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wikipedia</b></a><b> </b><b> \u00a0</b></p></blockquote><p>The Martian\u2019s use of Black Smoke also heralded the real life use of chemical weapons several years after the publication of the book by the Germans during WWI. \u00a0And their Heat-Ray inspired the invention of the laser several decades later. \u00a0Much of the scientific theories about possible life on Mars proposed in the book have since been proven to be false. \u00a0Nonetheless, it has not lessened the influence of the book or curb the imagination of its fans that believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p><p>Now you probably think that I\u2019m about to talk about the aliens playing a role in ASOIAF and if so, you are completely wrong. \u00a0This essay is in fact primarily about the most mundane of earthly creatures\u2014ants. \u00a0Not to say that objects from space don\u2019t play a role in both H.G. Wells timeless story and Martin\u2019s modern classic. \u00a0They do and so I should probably talk about them briefly before I move on to the main topic of ants. \u00a0</p><p>As with the Targaryen\u2019s dragons, the famous Martians invaders from <i>The War of the Worlds</i> are associated with both a pit and meteors. The Targaryen dragons were housed in the dragon pit below the Red Keep and of course, Dany locked Rhaegal and Viserion in one beneath Meereen. </p><p>The landing site of the first Martian \u201cship\u201d in the Wells\u2019 story was in the sand pit at Horsell Common. \u00a0Subsequent landings each created a pit on impact. \u00a0And like the dragon pit does for the fiery creatures in ASOIAF, the ones in <i>The War of the Worlds</i> serves as the home base for the Martians when they are not out killing earthlings with their Heat-Ray. \u00a0It is also in the pit that they built their machines of mass destruction.\u00a0 Later, I will have more to say about the symbolic importances of the pit in both books but for now, let\u2019s move on.</p><p>The Martians journeyed to earth not in what today\u2019s audience would expect to see in a spaceship but rather in a cylinder that is shot from their home planet directly to the earth. \u00a0Don\u2019t forget that the book was first published in 1897 and flying saucers; spaceships and warp speed were not yet part of the lexicon. The cylinder bearing the Martians as would be expected was thought to be just another meteor as it entered the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The citizens of England soon discover that the falling star they saw in their night sky was in fact not a meteor but actually a cylinder bearing invaders from Mars.</p><p>In ASOIAF, there are suggestions that the Qartheen myth told to Dany by her handmaiden is actually about a meteor shower hitting the earth and causing the Long Night. \u00a0And no, I\u2019m not saying that dragons come from outer space. \u00a0We, the readers are not yet sure what brought dragons into the world of Planetos. Are they creatures of evolution or were they created in some manner by one of the ancient races of the East\u2026possibly the Great Empire of the Dawn? The answer is not yet known but the Qartheen myth told to Dany offers up one explanation. \u00a0</p><p>The ancient Qarthians quite possibly built their legend of the origins of dragons around an in-world meteor shower. \u00a0Other cultures including those in Westeros developed different myths based on the same celestial event. \u00a0In the case of the Westerosi, their legend is of the Children of the Forest calling down the Hammer of the Waters. \u00a0Only time and George will tell whether there was a magical component to the meteor shower or whether it was a natural occurring event.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo dragon,\u201d Irri said. \u201cBrave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It is known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is known,\u201d agreed Jhiqui.</p><p>\u201cA trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,\u201d blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed their father\u2019s khalasar. Doreah was older, almost twenty. Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys.</p><p>Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. \u201cThe moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,\u201d the Lysene girl said. \u201cOnce there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame.

But these meteors brought with them alien invaders instead of dragons. </p><blockquote><p>Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, <b>a line of flame high in the atmosphere</b>. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p><b>Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound</b>. I myself heard nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Falling Star </b></p></blockquote><p>Hmmm, a falling star described as a flame streaking across the sky. \u00a0Now where have we seen a similar description? \u00a0Perhaps it was the comet that was seen over Planetos\u2026only that streak was red while in <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, it is green.</p><blockquote><p>The morning of King Joffrey\u2019s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. \"What do you think it means?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cGlory to your betrothed,\u201d Ser Arys answered at once. \u201c<b>See how it flames across the sky today</b> on His Grace\u2019s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey\u2019s Comet.\u201d</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Sansa I</b></p></blockquote><p>Old Nan told Bran that the coming of the comet meant dragons and as is usually the case, she was right. \u00a0It was more about symbolism but Dany\u2019s dragons were born into the world on a night when the comet was seen in the sky over the Dothraki Sea. \u00a0And just as the comet heralded the birth of dragons into the world again on Planetos, the falling star with the hissing snake like sound of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> brought to England a dragon of a different sort.</p><blockquote><p>Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, <b>the Gorgon groups of tentacles</b>, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth\u2014above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes\u2014were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Cylinder Opens</b></p></blockquote><p>The Martians look nothing like our ideas of dragons and are not referred to as such. They are literally just a big brain with snake like tentacles\u00a0reminiscent of an Octopus.\u00a0 They build for themselves protective armor with tripod legs that allows them to move around in the heavier earth gravity.\u00a0 \u00a0However, while they look nothing like our ideas of dragons, surprisingly there are several symbolic comparisons. \u00a0This entails the many snakes like allusions such as the one to a Gorgon, which refers to any of the three sisters from Greek mythology whose hair is made of living serpents. \u00a0And in ASOIAF, George often uses snake like symbolism to refer to dragons. The Gorgons\u2014three heads of the dragon as it were.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1058\" data-orig-height=\"1367\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fe3e3ff6202a2b74f23d116c35baf66/tumblr_inline_pn1qw5Sj0N1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1058\" data-orig-height=\"1367\"></figure><blockquote><p>Illustration by Frank R.

The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a <b>thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Falling Star</b></p><p><b>\u2014-</b></p><p>The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in then same position. But now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder. <b>Air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.</b></p><p>They listened, <b>rapped on the scaly burnt metal</b> with a stick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead.</p></blockquote><p>As Alice would be wont to say, things are getting \u201ccuriouser and curiouser\u201d because it just so happens that George also describes the scales of Dany\u2019s dragon eggs as looking like metal. </p><blockquote><p>Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce \u2026 and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. <b>The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales</b>, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, <b>they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun</b>.</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys II</b></p></blockquote><p>One can argue that the cylinder is to the Martians what Dany\u2019s eggs are to her dragon children\u2014an outer layer that offers protection to develop prior to their birth into the world. \u00a0The earthlings hear a banging from inside the meteor/cylinder and initially think that their Martian visitors are trapped inside and need help. They soon find out that is definitely not the case and that it was simply the Martians preparing for their symbolic birth into the world of man.</p><blockquote><p>I think everyone expected to see a man emerge\u2014possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks\u2014like eyes. Then something resembling <b>a little grey snake</b>, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me\u2014and then another.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.</p><p>Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Cylinder Opens</b></p></blockquote><p>The creatures re-enter the cylinder but shortly later they again make an appearance. \u00a0This time, the humans find out that they are not dealing with your friendly neighborhood Martians when the invaders introduce the earthlings to their heat ray. \u00a0</p><p>The fact that the Martians are compared to snakes and that the their arrival is in a cylinder that was originally believed to be a meteor echoes in ASOIAF but are these similarities sufficient on which to build a comparative study? Possibly not! The same might even be said of the scaly description of their cylinder home. In fact, I would probably have ignored these similarities if not for some other ones in play, most notably that like dragon and their fire, the Martian Heat-Ray is compared to a flaming sword in the sky and of course the ants\u2026the central focus of this essay.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"502\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b06d88d5e87d2159229a25f5432d1d3/tumblr_inline_pml6dqoR2k1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"502\"></figure><blockquote><p>Illustration for the 1906 edition of War of the Worlds by Henrique Alvim Corr\u00eaa<br></p></blockquote><p>Let\u2019s now look at some more of the similarities between the descriptions Wells uses depict the Martians and their heat-ray and how George describes Dany\u2019s dragons.<br></p><blockquote><p>It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily<b>, this flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I</b> perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir. <b>I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled</b>. Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common. <b>Forthwith the hissing and humming ceased</b>, and the black, domelike object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.</p><p>All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise. But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: \u00a0The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>Here is another comparison of the Heat-Ray to a sword.</p><blockquote><p>For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; <b>that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: How I Reached Home </b></p></blockquote><p>The narrator of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> likened the Martian heat-ray to a flaming sword of death and here is Xaro comparing Dany\u2019s dragon to a sword in a similar manner. \u00a0Do you think it\u2019s possible that Wells\u2019 description of the Martians and their heat-ray was George\u2019s was inspiration for depicting the dragons in such a manner? \u00a0I certainly think that\u2019s a strong possibility.</p><blockquote><p>\"When I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,\u201d Xaro went on, \u201cbut Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, \u2018She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.\u2019 When your dragons were small they were a wonder. <b>Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world</b>.\u201d He wiped away the tears. \u201cI should have slain you in Qarth.\u201d</p><p><b>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys III</b></p></blockquote><p>Like the Targaryen dragons, the Martians also produce different color fire or smoke and one in particular\u2014the Black Smoke that appears later in the story is extra deadly as it seems to be some type of chemical weapon. \u00a0Also, please note the symbolic reference to three distinct puffs of smoke just prior to the heat-ray being used for the first time. After seeing all the other similarities to dragons, one can\u2019t help but think of Dany\u2019s three children</p><blockquote><p><b>Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs</b>, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.</p><p><b>This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead</b> and the hazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><b>Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming</b>, into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.</p><p>Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men. <b>It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.</b> It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>The passages that cover the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons are too long to post but I want to include a section where you see how the birth of the Martians and the reveal of their fiery power has the same feel. \u00a0Keep in mind that a horse which the narrator hears squeal is associated with the birth of the Martians, there is also one at the scene for the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons as her Bloodrider Aggo kills a stallion to be used as a sacrifice in the pyre. \u00a0This horse is meant to symbolize Drogo\u2019s stallion that he will ride into the afterworld. </p><blockquote><p>Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, shriller \u2026 then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony.</p><p>And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany\u2019s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever.</p><p>She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur\u2019s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.</p><p>________</p><p>Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant <b>she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing</b>.<b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X </b><br></p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X </b></p></blockquote><p>The inclusion of the horse in the dragon birthing scene locked in my belief that George wrote the birth of Dany\u2019s dragons to echo that of the Martians.\u00a0 Just as a horse was burnt to death in the Martian birthing scene, the same was the case with the birth of the dragons.\u00a0 Although to be fair, Dany had the horse killed before it was added to the pyre.</p><p>And does not her vision of Khal Drogo and his flaming lash remind you of this passage from when the Heat-Ray first appeared.</p><blockquote><p><b>Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediatel</b>y withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion. What could be going on there?</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>You\u2019ve seen from the excerpts I\u2019ve posted that with his use of descriptive language, Wells wants you to think of the Martians as snakes. The Targaryens and their dragons are also often compared to snakes. \u00a0Here are just a few of those passages in question.</p><blockquote><p>Only dragons and men eat cooked meat, he had said.</p><p>When she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black, <b>the dragons ripped at it eagerly, their heads striking like snakes</b>.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Daenerys I</b></p><p><b>\u2014\u2014</b></p><p>Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering, and the sounds grew faintly louder. <b>Drogon\u2019s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream</b>, steam rising from between his teeth. He hears it too. Dany turned to the blank wall once more, but there was nothing. Could there be a secret door, a door I cannot see? Another torch went out. Another. The first door on the right, he said, always the first door on the right. The first door on the right \u2026</p><p>It came to her suddenly\u2026 . is the last door on the left!</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Daenerys IV</b></p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>\"\u2026 don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?\u201d</p><p>Viserys stood before her, screaming. \u201cThe dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. I am the dragon, and I will be crowned.\u201d The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh. \u201c<b>I am the dragon and I will be crowned!\u201d he shrieked, and his fingers snapped like snakes</b>, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks.</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys IX</b></p></blockquote><p>I also mentioned that there was a Black Smoke or poisonous gas used by the Martians to kill the humans in mass. \u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at how Wells describes it to see if anything seems familiar.</p><blockquote><p>We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us.</p><p>A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate\u2019s hand as he fled out of the front room. <b>When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it. </b></p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: Underfoot</b></p></blockquote><p>We see the after effect of the Black Smoke described as a black snowstorm. Did you notice how again Wells reinforces the comparison of the Martians to snake with the hissing reference?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1154\" data-orig-height=\"648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b87a494883647a7c48639cd0cdbc497/tumblr_inline_pmo6s0CV9A1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1154\" data-orig-height=\"648\"></figure><p>Having watched <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, the black snowstorm reminded me of the scene from Dany\u2019s vision of her walking in the throne room of the Red Keep. Snow is falling around her but with her Targaryen heritage, we the audience are never sure whether we are meant to interpret it as snow or ashes.</p><p>Here is another scene involving the Black Smoke that reinforces its comparison to ashes and which suggests that maybe that is exactly how we should be interpreting the snow in her vision. \u00a0This time, Wells uses fiery language to describe the after effects of the smoke as cindery powder. He then goes further comparing the landscape to Pompeii, which automatically makes one think of the destruction of Old Valyria and Harrenhal.</p><blockquote><p>In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all <b>covered thickly with black dust</b>. <b>That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: Underfoot</b> </p></blockquote><p>The above description of bodies covered in ashes also makes me remember the dead bodies Tyrion passed on the Field of Fire that were nothing more than ashes. In addition to Valyria and Harrenhal, one must consider the eventual burning of Kings Landing by Dany that\u2019s been foreshadowed in both the books and show. The result will definitely look like a modern day Pompeii.</p><p>The Martians even built machines that flew and the descriptive language Wells uses to describe the scene made me think of how Belarion and Drogon are depicted when their wings are fully extended. Note also that this scene takes place when the invaders attack a group of ships on the river, which of course brings to mind the upcoming Battle of Fire in Meereen.</p><blockquote><p>Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. <b>A mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun</b>. The steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense.</p><p>The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the evening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. <b>Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness\u2014rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very large</b>, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night. <b>And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The \u201cThunder Child\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>And here is Dany\u2019s description of Drogon as she sees him from afar as she wonders the Dothraki Sea.</p><blockquote><p>Thrice that day she caught sight of Drogon. Once he was so far off that he might have been an <b>eagle</b>, slipping in and out of distant clouds, but Dany knew the look of him by now, even when he was no more than a speck. <b>The second time he passed before the sun, his black wings spread, and the world darkened</b>.</p><p><b>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys X</b></p></blockquote><p>Here we come to the end of part one. In the next chapter, we get to the heart of the essay when we discuss eatable ants and what Wells use of the metaphor in <i>The War of the Worlds</i> and George\u2019s in the same manner in <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> portends for the final arc of Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>Read part 2 <b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182728166641/daenerys-targaryen-martians-eatable-ants-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></b>!</p>",

Martin has been inspired by many different schools of thought. &nbsp;This ranges from the obvious and acknowledged influences of the history of the War of the Roses, various world mythologies and literary inspiration like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</i> and the poetry of Robert Frost to name just a few. &nbsp;There are numerous others including ones that I would never recognize.&nbsp; However, this essay is about none of those.&nbsp; Instead it is about one literary influence I recently discovered while reading the book, which I&nbsp;have not previously seen discussed.</p><p>As a fan of science fiction and fantasy, there are some books of the genre that I am almost ashamed to say that I have never read. &nbsp;Until a recently, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> was one such book for me. &nbsp;Thankfully, two weeks ago I was able to scratch it off of my list of things to do as I finally read the story that has inspired and scared so many fans over the years.&nbsp; And as I read it, I was shocked but not surprised at the number of symbolic parallels between it and ASOIAF&mdash; specifically the arc of Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>Some of you may be<i> </i>familiar with Wells&rsquo; classic story either from reading the book or watching one of the many movie versions, including the Tom Cruise one from a few years ago. &nbsp;Unlike in the movie, the Martians in the book don&rsquo;t land in NJ or any other American City. &nbsp;Instead, the invasion begins in a sand pit on Horsell Common in Surrey England. The quote I mentioned above is from the actual book and a soldier says it to the nameless protagonist as they hide out in a house right outside London to evade the alien invaders. </p><p>The parallels between Martin&rsquo;s world of fiery dragons, and the H.G. Wells classic tale of invaders from Mars are plentiful. &nbsp;In this article I will take a look at the similarities between the two books and discuss what it might suggest about Daenerys Targaryen&rsquo;s final arc.</p><p>On the surface, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> is a science fiction story about alien invaders from Mars who land in England and attempt a takeover of the earth. However, if you look below the obvious, Wells&rsquo; story is actually an anti-imperialistic treatise on England. &nbsp;While a classic of the genre, there is also inherent racism and sexism on display as Wells who would have been considered a liberal of his time still thought of people of different races as inferior to Europeans and presented females as flighty and of lesser intelligence. &nbsp;Yet he recognized the devastation the English brought to the people of other countries via their practice of colonialism.</p><p>At the time of its publication in 1897, Britain was at the height of its imperialistic power and it truly was the empire &ldquo;on which the sun never set.&rdquo; &nbsp;Wells, like Martin was a pacifist and he wrote a novel that placed England on the other side of the coin where it was not the conquering nation but rather the country being invaded and whose people were being killed, subjugated, and culture destroyed.</p><blockquote><p>And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them.</p><p>And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Eve of the War</b></p></blockquote><p>One of the most influential books of all time, the story was written by Wells over 125 years ago. &nbsp;The novel has influenced artists across multiple genres including film, literature and many of the sciences as little boys and girls look to the stars and wonder, what if? &nbsp;It was also eerily prescient on the tactics of future warfare.</p><blockquote><p>As noted by Howard Black: &ldquo;In concrete details the Martian Fighting Machines as depicted by Wells have nothing in common with tanks or dive bombers, but the tactical and strategic use made of them is strikingly reminiscent of Blitzkrieg as it would be developed by the German armed forces four decades later. The description of the Martians advancing inexorably, at lightning speed, towards London; the British Army completely unable to put up an effective resistance; the British government disintegrating and evacuating the capital; the mass of terrified refugees clogging the roads, all were to be precisely enacted in real life at 1940 France.&rdquo; </p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds%22%20%5Cl%20%22Scientific_predictions_and_accuracy\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wikipedia</b></a><b> </b><b> &nbsp;</b></p></blockquote><p>The Martian&rsquo;s use of Black Smoke also heralded the real life use of chemical weapons several years after the publication of the book by the Germans during WWI. &nbsp;And their Heat-Ray inspired the invention of the laser several decades later. &nbsp;Much of the scientific theories about possible life on Mars proposed in the book have since been proven to be false. &nbsp;Nonetheless, it has not lessened the influence of the book or curb the imagination of its fans that believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p><p>Now you probably think that I&rsquo;m about to talk about the aliens playing a role in ASOIAF and if so, you are completely wrong. &nbsp;This essay is in fact primarily about the most mundane of earthly creatures&mdash;ants. &nbsp;Not to say that objects from space don&rsquo;t play a role in both H.G. Wells timeless story and Martin&rsquo;s modern classic. &nbsp;They do and so I should probably talk about them briefly before I move on to the main topic of ants. &nbsp;</p><p>As with the Targaryen&rsquo;s dragons, the famous Martians invaders from <i>The War of the Worlds</i> are associated with both a pit and meteors. The Targaryen dragons were housed in the dragon pit below the Red Keep and of course, Dany locked Rhaegal and Viserion in one beneath Meereen. </p><p>The landing site of the first Martian &ldquo;ship&rdquo; in the Wells&rsquo; story was in the sand pit at Horsell Common. &nbsp;Subsequent landings each created a pit on impact. &nbsp;And like the dragon pit does for the fiery creatures in ASOIAF, the ones in <i>The War of the Worlds</i> serves as the home base for the Martians when they are not out killing earthlings with their Heat-Ray. &nbsp;It is also in the pit that they built their machines of mass destruction.&nbsp; Later, I will have more to say about the symbolic importances of the pit in both books but for now, let&rsquo;s move on.</p><p>The Martians journeyed to earth not in what today&rsquo;s audience would expect to see in a spaceship but rather in a cylinder that is shot from their home planet directly to the earth. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t forget that the book was first published in 1897 and flying saucers; spaceships and warp speed were not yet part of the lexicon. The cylinder bearing the Martians as would be expected was thought to be just another meteor as it entered the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. The citizens of England soon discover that the falling star they saw in their night sky was in fact not a meteor but actually a cylinder bearing invaders from Mars.</p><p>In ASOIAF, there are suggestions that the Qartheen myth told to Dany by her handmaiden is actually about a meteor shower hitting the earth and causing the Long Night. &nbsp;And no, I&rsquo;m not saying that dragons come from outer space. &nbsp;We, the readers are not yet sure what brought dragons into the world of Planetos. Are they creatures of evolution or were they created in some manner by one of the ancient races of the East&hellip;possibly the Great Empire of the Dawn? The answer is not yet known but the Qartheen myth told to Dany offers up one explanation. &nbsp;</p><p>The ancient Qarthians quite possibly built their legend of the origins of dragons around an in-world meteor shower. &nbsp;Other cultures including those in Westeros developed different myths based on the same celestial event. &nbsp;In the case of the Westerosi, their legend is of the Children of the Forest calling down the Hammer of the Waters. &nbsp;Only time and George will tell whether there was a magical component to the meteor shower or whether it was a natural occurring event.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No dragon,&rdquo; Irri said. &ldquo;Brave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It is known.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is known,&rdquo; agreed Jhiqui.</p><p>&ldquo;A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,&rdquo; blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed their father&rsquo;s khalasar. Doreah was older, almost twenty. Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys.</p><p>Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. &ldquo;The moon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,&rdquo; the Lysene girl said. &ldquo;Once there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.&rdquo;</p><p>The two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed. &ldquo;You are foolish strawhead slave,&rdquo; Irri said. &ldquo;Moon is no egg. Moon is god, woman wife of sun. It is known.&rdquo;</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys III</b></p></blockquote><p>As was first suggested by Lucifer Means Lightbringer in his seminal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6H7ZcZlUL8&amp;list=PLEHvft-cyPmDWPIXUhJhL0F61vIw2nuS0\" target=\"_blank\">Bloodstone Compendium</a> series of essays, the description of the moon wandering too close to the sun and dragons pouring forth is quite possibly a descriptive way of saying there was a meteor shower. &nbsp;This event was also possibly the cause of the Long Night as the metaphorical description of dragons eating the fire of the sun suggests that the celestial light it gives off was hidden from the world. &nbsp;I find this symbolic association of dragons with the potential cause of the Long Night quite interesting because dragons potentially playing a role in this catastrophic event whether literally or metaphorically cannot be a positive. &nbsp;However, this essay is not about the Long Night but rather about the symbolism surrounding Dany and her dragons that echoes that of the Martians invaders in Wells&rsquo; story.</p><p>Like Martin&rsquo;s dragons, Wells&rsquo; Martians are strongly associated with fire, snakes and meteors. &nbsp;There are actually several meteor strikes at the heart of <i>The War of the Worlds</i>.&nbsp; To be precise, there are 10 strikes.&nbsp; When the initial Martian machine lands in England, the locals and officials thought it was a meteor until they investigated and saw it was an object shaped by metal. But these meteors brought with them alien invaders instead of dragons. </p><blockquote><p>Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, <b>a line of flame high in the atmosphere</b>. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><b>Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound</b>. I myself heard nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Falling Star </b></p></blockquote><p>Hmmm, a falling star described as a flame streaking across the sky. &nbsp;Now where have we seen a similar description? &nbsp;Perhaps it was the comet that was seen over Planetos&hellip;only that streak was red while in <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, it is green.</p><blockquote><p>The morning of King Joffrey&rsquo;s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. \"What do you think it means?&rdquo; she asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Glory to your betrothed,&rdquo; Ser Arys answered at once. &ldquo;<b>See how it flames across the sky today</b> on His Grace&rsquo;s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey&rsquo;s Comet.&rdquo;</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Sansa I</b></p></blockquote><p>Old Nan told Bran that the coming of the comet meant dragons and as is usually the case, she was right. &nbsp;It was more about symbolism but Dany&rsquo;s dragons were born into the world on a night when the comet was seen in the sky over the Dothraki Sea. &nbsp;And just as the comet heralded the birth of dragons into the world again on Planetos, the falling star with the hissing snake like sound of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> brought to England a dragon of a different sort.</p><blockquote><p>Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, <b>the Gorgon groups of tentacles</b>, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth&mdash;above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes&mdash;were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Cylinder Opens</b></p></blockquote><p>The Martians look nothing like our ideas of dragons and are not referred to as such. They are literally just a big brain with snake like tentacles&nbsp;reminiscent of an Octopus.&nbsp; They build for themselves protective armor with tripod legs that allows them to move around in the heavier earth gravity.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, while they look nothing like our ideas of dragons, surprisingly there are several symbolic comparisons. &nbsp;This entails the many snakes like allusions such as the one to a Gorgon, which refers to any of the three sisters from Greek mythology whose hair is made of living serpents. &nbsp;And in ASOIAF, George often uses snake like symbolism to refer to dragons. The Gorgons&mdash;three heads of the dragon as it were.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fe3e3ff6202a2b74f23d116c35baf66/tumblr_inline_pn1qw5Sj0N1scj86c_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Illustration by Frank R. Paul for a 1927 edition of Amazing Stories Magazine</p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>They may not look like dragons but the cylinder/ship the Martians arrive in have a scaly outer shell that is very reminiscent of Dany&rsquo;s dragon eggs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a <b>thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Falling Star</b></p><p><b>&mdash;-</b></p><p>The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in then same position. But now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder. <b>Air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.</b></p><p>They listened, <b>rapped on the scaly burnt metal</b> with a stick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead.</p></blockquote><p>As Alice would be wont to say, things are getting &ldquo;curiouser and curiouser&rdquo; because it just so happens that George also describes the scales of Dany&rsquo;s dragon eggs as looking like metal. </p><blockquote><p>Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce &hellip; and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. <b>The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales</b>, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, <b>they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun</b>.</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys II</b></p></blockquote><p>One can argue that the cylinder is to the Martians what Dany&rsquo;s eggs are to her dragon children&mdash;an outer layer that offers protection to develop prior to their birth into the world. &nbsp;The earthlings hear a banging from inside the meteor/cylinder and initially think that their Martian visitors are trapped inside and need help. They soon find out that is definitely not the case and that it was simply the Martians preparing for their symbolic birth into the world of man.</p><blockquote><p>I think everyone expected to see a man emerge&mdash;possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks&mdash;like eyes. Then something resembling <b>a little grey snake</b>, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me&mdash;and then another.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.</p><p>Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Cylinder Opens</b></p></blockquote><p>The creatures re-enter the cylinder but shortly later they again make an appearance. &nbsp;This time, the humans find out that they are not dealing with your friendly neighborhood Martians when the invaders introduce the earthlings to their heat ray. &nbsp;</p><p>The fact that the Martians are compared to snakes and that the their arrival is in a cylinder that was originally believed to be a meteor echoes in ASOIAF but are these similarities sufficient on which to build a comparative study? Possibly not! The same might even be said of the scaly description of their cylinder home. In fact, I would probably have ignored these similarities if not for some other ones in play, most notably that like dragon and their fire, the Martian Heat-Ray is compared to a flaming sword in the sky and of course the ants&hellip;the central focus of this essay.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b06d88d5e87d2159229a25f5432d1d3/tumblr_inline_pml6dqoR2k1scj86c_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Illustration for the 1906 edition of War of the Worlds by Henrique Alvim Corr&ecirc;a<br /></p></blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s now look at some more of the similarities between the descriptions Wells uses depict the Martians and their heat-ray and how George describes Dany&rsquo;s dragons.<br /></p><blockquote><p>It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily<b>, this flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I</b> perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir. <b>I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled</b>. Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common. <b>Forthwith the hissing and humming ceased</b>, and the black, domelike object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.</p><p>All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise. But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: &nbsp;The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>Here is another comparison of the Heat-Ray to a sword.</p><blockquote><p>For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; <b>that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: How I Reached Home </b></p></blockquote><p>The narrator of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> likened the Martian heat-ray to a flaming sword of death and here is Xaro comparing Dany&rsquo;s dragon to a sword in a similar manner. &nbsp;Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that Wells&rsquo; description of the Martians and their heat-ray was George&rsquo;s was inspiration for depicting the dragons in such a manner? &nbsp;I certainly think that&rsquo;s a strong possibility.</p><blockquote><p>\"When I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child,&rdquo; Xaro went on, &ldquo;but Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, &lsquo;She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.&rsquo; When your dragons were small they were a wonder. <b>Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world</b>.&rdquo; He wiped away the tears. &ldquo;I should have slain you in Qarth.&rdquo;</p><p><b>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys III</b></p></blockquote><p>Like the Targaryen dragons, the Martians also produce different color fire or smoke and one in particular&mdash;the Black Smoke that appears later in the story is extra deadly as it seems to be some type of chemical weapon. &nbsp;Also, please note the symbolic reference to three distinct puffs of smoke just prior to the heat-ray being used for the first time. After seeing all the other similarities to dragons, one can&rsquo;t help but think of Dany&rsquo;s three children</p><blockquote><p><b>Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs</b>, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.</p><p><b>This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead</b> and the hazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><b>Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming</b>, into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.</p><p>Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men. <b>It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.</b> It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>The passages that cover the birth of Dany&rsquo;s dragons are too long to post but I want to include a section where you see how the birth of the Martians and the reveal of their fiery power has the same feel. &nbsp;Keep in mind that a horse which the narrator hears squeal is associated with the birth of the Martians, there is also one at the scene for the birth of Dany&rsquo;s dragons as her Bloodrider Aggo kills a stallion to be used as a sacrifice in the pyre. &nbsp;This horse is meant to symbolize Drogo&rsquo;s stallion that he will ride into the afterworld. </p><blockquote><p>Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, shriller &hellip; then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony.</p><p>And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany&rsquo;s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever.</p><p>She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur&rsquo;s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.</p><p>________</p><p>Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant <b>she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing</b>.<b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X </b><br /></p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys X </b></p></blockquote><p>The inclusion of the horse in the dragon birthing scene locked in my belief that George wrote the birth of Dany&rsquo;s dragons to echo that of the Martians.&nbsp; Just as a horse was burnt to death in the Martian birthing scene, the same was the case with the birth of the dragons.&nbsp; Although to be fair, Dany had the horse killed before it was added to the pyre.</p><p>And does not her vision of Khal Drogo and his flaming lash remind you of this passage from when the Heat-Ray first appeared.</p><blockquote><p><b>Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediatel</b>y withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion. What could be going on there?</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The Heat-Ray</b></p></blockquote><p>You&rsquo;ve seen from the excerpts I&rsquo;ve posted that with his use of descriptive language, Wells wants you to think of the Martians as snakes. The Targaryens and their dragons are also often compared to snakes. &nbsp;Here are just a few of those passages in question.</p><blockquote><p>Only dragons and men eat cooked meat, he had said.</p><p>When she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black, <b>the dragons ripped at it eagerly, their heads striking like snakes</b>.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Daenerys I</b></p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;</b></p><p>Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering, and the sounds grew faintly louder. <b>Drogon&rsquo;s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream</b>, steam rising from between his teeth. He hears it too. Dany turned to the blank wall once more, but there was nothing. Could there be a secret door, a door I cannot see? Another torch went out. Another. The first door on the right, he said, always the first door on the right. The first door on the right &hellip;</p><p>It came to her suddenly&hellip; . is the last door on the left!</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Daenerys IV</b></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\"&hellip; don&rsquo;t want to wake the dragon, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>Viserys stood before her, screaming. &ldquo;The dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. I am the dragon, and I will be crowned.&rdquo; The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh. &ldquo;<b>I am the dragon and I will be crowned!&rdquo; he shrieked, and his fingers snapped like snakes</b>, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks.</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Daenerys IX</b></p></blockquote><p>I also mentioned that there was a Black Smoke or poisonous gas used by the Martians to kill the humans in mass. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look at how Wells describes it to see if anything seems familiar.</p><blockquote><p>We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us.</p><p>A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate&rsquo;s hand as he fled out of the front room. <b>When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it. </b></p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: Underfoot</b></p></blockquote><p>We see the after effect of the Black Smoke described as a black snowstorm. Did you notice how again Wells reinforces the comparison of the Martians to snake with the hissing reference?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b87a494883647a7c48639cd0cdbc497/tumblr_inline_pmo6s0CV9A1scj86c_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Having watched <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, the black snowstorm reminded me of the scene from Dany&rsquo;s vision of her walking in the throne room of the Red Keep. Snow is falling around her but with her Targaryen heritage, we the audience are never sure whether we are meant to interpret it as snow or ashes.</p><p>Here is another scene involving the Black Smoke that reinforces its comparison to ashes and which suggests that maybe that is exactly how we should be interpreting the snow in her vision. &nbsp;This time, Wells uses fiery language to describe the after effects of the smoke as cindery powder. He then goes further comparing the landscape to Pompeii, which automatically makes one think of the destruction of Old Valyria and Harrenhal.</p><blockquote><p>In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all <b>covered thickly with black dust</b>. <b>That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: Underfoot</b> </p></blockquote><p>The above description of bodies covered in ashes also makes me remember the dead bodies Tyrion passed on the Field of Fire that were nothing more than ashes. In addition to Valyria and Harrenhal, one must consider the eventual burning of Kings Landing by Dany that&rsquo;s been foreshadowed in both the books and show. The result will definitely look like a modern day Pompeii.</p><p>The Martians even built machines that flew and the descriptive language Wells uses to describe the scene made me think of how Belarion and Drogon are depicted when their wings are fully extended. Note also that this scene takes place when the invaders attack a group of ships on the river, which of course brings to mind the upcoming Battle of Fire in Meereen.</p><blockquote><p>Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. <b>A mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun</b>. The steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense.</p><p>The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the evening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. <b>Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness&mdash;rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very large</b>, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night. <b>And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land</b>.</p><p><b>The War of the Worlds: The &ldquo;Thunder Child&rdquo;</b></p></blockquote><p>And here is Dany&rsquo;s description of Drogon as she sees him from afar as she wonders the Dothraki Sea.</p><blockquote><p>Thrice that day she caught sight of Drogon. Once he was so far off that he might have been an <b>eagle</b>, slipping in and out of distant clouds, but Dany knew the look of him by now, even when he was no more than a speck. <b>The second time he passed before the sun, his black wings spread, and the world darkened</b>.</p><p><b>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys X</b></p></blockquote><p>Here we come to the end of part one. In the next chapter, we get to the heart of the essay when we discuss eatable ants and what Wells use of the metaphor in <i>The War of the Worlds</i> and George&rsquo;s in the same manner in <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> portends for the final arc of Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>Read part 2 <b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182728166641/daenerys-targaryen-martians-eatable-ants-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></b>!</p>",

Only&mdash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re eatable ants.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce3ae17b50b611e3d7d4ee09cd4154a4/tumblr_inline_pml5u8rxte1scj86c_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A warning in advance, this is a long essay. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s long because of the subject and the need to include a lot of quotes from the books to show the comparison I am about to discuss.</p>\n<p>In writing his magnum opus, George R.R. Martin has been inspired by many different schools of thought. &nbsp;This ranges from the obvious and acknowledged influences of the history of the War of the Roses, various world mythologies and literary inspiration like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</i> and the poetry of Robert Frost to name just a few. &nbsp;There are numerous others including ones that I would never recognize.&nbsp; However, this essay is about none of those.&nbsp; Instead it is about one literary influence I recently discovered while reading the book, which I&nbsp;have not previously seen discussed.</p>\n<p>As a fan of science fiction and fantasy, there are some books of the genre that I am almost ashamed to say that I have never read. &nbsp;Until a recently, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> was one such book for me. &nbsp;Thankfully, two weeks ago I was able to scratch it off of my list of things to do as I finally read the story that has inspired and scared so many fans over the years.&nbsp; And as I read it, I was shocked but not surprised at the number of symbolic parallels between it and ASOIAF&mdash; specifically the arc of Daenerys Targaryen.</p>\n<p>Some of you may be<i> </i>familiar with Wells&rsquo; classic story either from reading the book or watching one of the many movie versions, including the Tom Cruise one from a few years ago. &nbsp;Unlike in the movie, the Martians in the book don&rsquo;t land in NJ or any other American City. &nbsp;Instead, the invasion begins in a sand pit on Horsell Common in Surrey England. The quote I mentioned above is from the actual book and a soldier says it to the nameless protagonist as they hide out in a house right outside London to evade the alien invaders. </p>\n<p>The parallels between Martin&rsquo;s world of fiery dragons, and the H.G. Wells classic tale of invaders from Mars are plentiful. &nbsp;In this article I will take a look at the similarities between the two books and discuss what it might suggest about Daenerys Targaryen&rsquo;s final arc.</p>\n</p>",
