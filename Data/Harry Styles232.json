She&rsquo;s more confident than in my memories, and less shy. The way she grew up makes me smile and i find myself impatient to hear her next words, no matter what she&rsquo;s talking about.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a party tonight, a frat party I should say.&rdquo; I finally point out, taking a sip of my now cold coffee.</p><p>I let out a grimace and look up in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;A frat party? Are you in a fraternity?&rdquo;</p><p>Her question makes me chuckle and I shake my head slightly, leaning against the bench.</p><p>&ldquo;Me? Come on, you know me better than that. Do you see me in a fraternity?&rdquo;</p><p>I raise my eyebrows at her, the left corner of my lips still curled. She stares at me a few seconds and finally chuckles, shaking her head.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I guess not.&rdquo; she lets out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re smarter than that.&rdquo;</p><p>I smile more and lick my lips, crossing my arms over my chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going because a few of my friends are going, and it&rsquo;d be nice if you&rsquo;d come with me.&rdquo;</p><p>She tilts her head, staring at me, and i watch her as she starts nibbling nervously on her bottom lip. I glance at her mouth for half a second before looking back up in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, but only if you promise not to leave me by myself in a house full of strangers.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t expect that answer and I don&rsquo;t know why, but her words make me smile even more. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never do that.&rdquo; I admit in a low tone, moving against the table to be closer to her. &ldquo;I promise I&rsquo;ll follow you everywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>She lets out a short laugh and leans against the table too. I see her from up close and my smile falters a bit at the connection we suddenly seem to have.</p><p>&ldquo;I trust you.&rdquo;</p><p>Her words seem sincere and her voice is low, and I end up promising myself that i&rsquo;d never betray the trust that I don&rsquo;t feel I deserve just yet. I know she&rsquo;s giving it to me for old time&rsquo;s sake and because we used to be very close, but we both changed and I&rsquo;m scared to disappoint her. I would hate it.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>We stare at each other for a while and after a few minutes, I move back, breathing in and sighing low.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to drop you back to your car?&rdquo; I propose, trying to focus on my hands and avoiding her eyes for a reason I don&rsquo;t understand. &ldquo;I mean I thought about relaxing a bit before the party so I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be too interesting for you.&rdquo;<br/></p><blockquote><p><b>OLIVIA</b></p></blockquote><p>I felt an instant connection with him as soon as I saw him again but at this exact moment, while he&rsquo;s sitting in front of me, staring at me, and making me a promise, I feel even closer to him.
