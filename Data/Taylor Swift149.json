Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly.</b></p><p>Fifteen and wildly in love. To be so free&hellip;</p><p>I&rsquo;d been told plenty of times how lucky I was. How insanely, crazy lucky I was that I had found Embry Call. They didn&rsquo;t have to tell me, though, I KNEW I was lucky. I knew that he looked at me like no other boy his age could ever even dream of looking at a girl. He treated me better and thought more long term than sometimes even I did.</p><p>Sometimes I wondered what it was about me that made him this way. He had never been like this before (trust me I&rsquo;d asked) and he could be so immature and childish that in the moments of earnest and true love, I worried that maybe I was working with two people who looked exactly the same&hellip;</p><p>He was wild. Loving him was being on a rollercoaster, rarely ever calm and slow unless it was building up to something major. He was fun, but I fell in love with him because of the way he held me when I cried.</p><p>There was something mesermizing about him. About his laugh and how he tied his hair back and the way his eyebrows wiggles when he made a sex joke that would have made a nine year old tattle tell and a twelve year old holler with laughter. There was something in the way he kissed me that left me both completely satisfied and also dying for more. Something about the way he scooped me up when I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention or how he said my name when he wanted to cuddle or how he drew his last name next to mine that made me wonder if he was joking or daydreaming.</p><p>We&rsquo;d been dating a year and a half. We&rsquo;d gotten together when we were fourteen. Fourteen! We were sixteen now. Weird. It seemed insane and stupid and impossible but we never stopped. A year rolled around and then almost another and we were still here.</p><p>His arms around me felt like armor and I leaned back into him, smiling even though I was doing homework. &ldquo;I love you, Call.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, y/l/n.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t ven hesitate, but it didn&rsquo;t feel casual either. He enunciated it by leaving a kiss on my neck and I felt my smile soften. The sparks and insanity and bubbly feelings went away, but my happiness when being with him never did. He didn&rsquo;t spark me like a car engine starting, but he made me happy and I could do the same for him. That&rsquo;s all that would matter as long as we would allow it.</p><p>After a second, I sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this, Em,&rdquo; I whined. My head rested against his shoulder as he leaned forward to look closely at what I was working on, his hair tickling my jaw.</p><p>A sigh as heavy as mine escaped him. &ldquo;Why is your math so much harder than mine? We&rsquo;re both sophomores.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They hate me more.&rdquo; He scoffed, humored, but I feigned seriousness. &ldquo;Those teachers have a creepy adult crush on you. It&rsquo;s probably your smile. Or your eyes. Your hair. Your laugh. Your-&rdquo; he moved to come face to face with me, his darker skin tinted with a blush. &ldquo;Lips,&rdquo; I finished, smirking.</p><p>He kissed me and I grinned. When we parted I turned on my side, pushing my homework away with my foot before curling into Embry and closing my eyes. &ldquo;You have to do this,&rdquo; he reminded me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re already behind- your mom is going to ground you. And I&rsquo;m all she ever grounds you from anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Trying not to laugh, I groaned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me, Em this stuff is murder!&rdquo;</p><p>His nose traced along my neck and I sighed contentedly. &ldquo;Do it for me?&rdquo; I huffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a kiss every time you get a problem right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give me a kiss either way,&rdquo; I pointed out.&ldquo;</p><p>He leaned away. &quot;No I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Opened my eyes, I rose an eyebrow. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay in the same room as me and not kiss me, Call, but you can be cute and pretend to try.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes set and I knew hat I had just set of World War three. &ldquo;Bet.&rdquo;</p><p>I made the mistake and indeed bet.</p><p>Now I was sitting here, on my back as he leaned against the doorframe, looking at me with a smirk on his face but frustration in his eyes. I pouted. &ldquo;Em,&rdquo; I whined.</p><p>His face screwed up in concentration and I knew I\u2019d suceeded in making it harder to say no to me. &ldquo;Do your work and I\u2019ll give you a kiss,&rdquo; he offered rather casually and calmly.</p><p>I got an idea, smirking as I sat up and leaned over to do a problem. It took me a good few seconds but I pushed myself, pumped by my idea and anticipation. He came and sat next to me to make sure I was actually doing my work, probably surprised I\u2019d broken so quickly. When I finished, I sat back, grinning at him. &ldquo;I get a kiss now.&rdquo;</p><p>Embry searched my face for a few seconds, his eyebrows curled in doubt. Before he could find anything, though, I rolled my eyes and grabbed his collar, bringing his lips to mine. He made a half moan on the feeling of impact, his hand instinctively moving to my neck, his thumb caressing my jaw. I let nature take over and followed the flow of my wants - which I usually had to calm but was going to let completely lose now.</p><p>Moving and turning, I got to my knees without breaking the kiss, causing him to lean back a bit. I then moved into his lap, straddling him purposefully so that I grinned against him. He gasped and I smirked, my hands moving into his hair to wrap in the long strands and tug slightly. Another moan escaped him, muffled and low and longer than the first. His hands moved to my waist, gripping me tightly and pulling me close. My tongue ran along his bottom lip and he let me in without even a pause, enjoying the rare show of dominance. My hands moved again, this time breaking the kiss only a second to take my shirt off.</p><p>The house was empty and this was SO much better than doing homework. I kissed him again and his hands flattened against my exposed sides and stomach. He went to pull me close but then groaned and pushed me away. I went back in to kiss him again but he turned his head. &ldquo;You need to do homework,&rdquo; he reminded me, his voice huskier than usual.</p><p>Determined, I moved to kissing his neck, my teeth and lips moving across his warm skin. He hummed in appreciation. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I whispered seductively. &ldquo;I want you, Em.&rdquo;</p><p>He pushed me away, his eyes darkened with lust as he tried to control himself. &ldquo;Y/n, you are going to do your homework.&rdquo; I glared at him, crawling off and returning to my after school hell. He leaned close, his fingers grazing my bra clasp as he whispered, &ldquo;And then I\u2019ll fuck you senseless.&rdquo;</p><p>Who needed much more motivation than that?</p><p>-</p><p>I remember the day it all fell apart.</p><p>Embry Call was a lot of things, but he was very rarely ever angry. Never was he as violently angry as he was now.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around my wrist, pulling me closer. &ldquo;Why won\u2019t you just LISTEN?&rdquo; My eyes widened and I flinched. I wasn\u2019t scared of him but he was being rough and aggressive and I didn\u2019t like it. &ldquo;Why did you go to that party? You could have been hurt!&rdquo;</p><p>Ripping my arm away was harder than I thought and I ended up just pulling him closer. He was intimidating when angry. &ldquo;I had it under control,&rdquo; I promised calmly, trying to process this sudden turn in his personality. He worried, sure, but usually when I did something stupid he\u2019d wrap me in a hug and kiss me and tell me how stupid I was and tell me to at least involve him next time so he could keep an eye on me&hellip;</p><p>Now he was pissed. &ldquo;You broke down on the road and just WALKED home? Your phone died? You didn\u2019t answer any of my calls and texts- Y/n I thought we\u2019d have to find your body somewhere!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Embry, I\u2019m sorry okay? It wasn\u2019t-Hey, that hurts!&rdquo; His eyes widened and his face relaxed as I exclaimed, loosening his grip on my wrist so that I could rip it away, my other hand rubbing the throbbing skin gently. My eyes watered and I felt stupid crying. I should be yelling at him, or leaving the house and ignoring him for a very long time. Make sure he NEVER did something like this again. But I was shocked. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I got caught up in the moment.</p><p>His eyes searched mine and then looked to my wrist. &ldquo;Did- did I hurt you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not badly,&rdquo; I comforted. &ldquo;Look, you need to calm down okay? What\u2019s gotten into you?&rdquo;</p><p>He stepped back, eyes widening. &ldquo;Not badly? Y/n, did I hurt you?&rdquo;</p><p>My mouth opened and then closed. I frowned. &ldquo;A little bit,&rdquo; I admitted begrudgingly. Embry took another step back until his legs bumped into the couch and then he basically collapsed on it. My eyes went wide and I forgot my wrist in favor of rushing the few steps to kneel next him. My hand went to his forehead. &ldquo;Em you\u2019re burning up&hellip; Come on let\u2019s get you to bed.&rdquo; I carried him to his room, helping take his shirt and shoes off and laying him in bed to be wrapped in blankets- how he always slept. &ldquo;I\u2019ll bring over some soup tomorrow,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;For now, stay warm and go to sleep. Now. You need rest. I\u2019ll get you a glass of water for when you wake up because you\u2019ll need lots of fluids. Maybe you should-&rdquo;</p><p>He caught my wrist, gently. The same wrist he\u2019d held in an iron grip earlier. His eyes were sad as he looked at my hand, tugging me closer so he could kiss my wrist. &ldquo;I\u2019m sorry.&rdquo; His voice broke and he suddenly looked so exhausted and worn out that my heart broke too.</p><p>Kneeling next to his bed, I wiped his hair out of his face. &ldquo;It\u2019s okay,&rdquo; I eased. &ldquo;Just don\u2019t do that again okay? Ever.&rdquo; He nodded. I huffed. &ldquo;Well you\u2019ve never done anything like that before and you were worried sick and actually not feeling well, so I\u2019ll excuse it once.&rdquo; We exchanged a smile. &ldquo;Now I\u2019ll get that water and then head home, okay? Sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>As I went to leave the room, Embry asked, &ldquo;How did I get so lucky to have you?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled to myself. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know, Call.\u201d As I promised, I got him a cup of water, kissed him goodbye, and headed home. I went right to sleep so I could wake up early the next morning and make him the soup I\u2019d promised. Homemade, my mom\u2019s recipe. I brought it to Embry\u2019s house, smiling when his mother answered.</p><p>Her face was sad though and my smile wavered. &quot;He says for you not to come in right now, dear. He\u2019s just gotten worse than yesterday, Jacob Black\u2019s father brought Sam Uley came over when I called to ask him if he knew anything about it&hellip; I\u2019m sorry, hun, but they said it\u2019s really contagious.&rdquo;</p><p>My heart fell but I nodded, wondering where I\u2019d heard that name before. Sam Uley. It sounded way too familiar to not be able to tie it to something, but I couldn\u2019t place exactly where I\u2019d heard it before. &ldquo;Well, give this to him will you?&rdquo; I asked, holding up my bowl of soup.</p><p>She grinned. &ldquo;Aw, how sweet! He\u2019ll love this, thank you, I will. Hope to see you soon, dear.&rdquo; And then she went inside and I stepped away from the house, sighing heavily. I moved to Embry\u2019s window after a small pause, my fingers reaching up to tap three times, pause, tap two times, pause, and then tap once. This was our secret code: 3, 2, 1. And then he would response with 1, 2, 3.</p><p>The response never came.</p><p>Dismissing it since he was probably asleep, I turned away from the house and went back to my own again. I\u2019d be able to talk to him again soon- I could last a few days&hellip;</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t see Embry Call again for far longer than just a few days.</p><p><b>Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you&rsquo;re already flying through the free fall. Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.</b></p><p>I can\u2019t help but think of how we met as I sit here by myself.</p><p>We were young, in middle school. I\u2019d loved next to Jacob Black as long as I remembered but I was awkward and kind of a loner because I was too boyish and rough to hang out with the girls and boys didn\u2019t want me because I was a girl. A snotty girl had shoved me in the hallway, and I lashed out because I would not let this even start. I was ending this- NOW. I was not the kind of person to lay down and take anything; you don\u2019t mess with me.</p><p>After I went off on her and she attempted to shove me again, I pushed her onto her ass, tackling her to the ground and pinning her arms with my legs and using my hands to slam down next to either side of her face, startling her. &ldquo;Don\u2019t,&rdquo; I enunciated. &ldquo;Do that.&rdquo;</p><p>A teacher had begun to come over so I scrambled off of her. She started crying and I got sent to the principals office, but after I explained everything, thy called us both in, made us truce, and that was it. She left me alone, and so did everyone else.</p><p>Completely alone&hellip; as usual.</p><p>On my way home from school, Jacob caught up to me. &ldquo;The way you stood up to that girl was crazy cool.&rdquo;</p><p>I grinned, excited by the idea of a new friend. The two of us really hit it off and he invited me to hang out with him and his friends. I of course agreed. When the time came and I finally met Embry and Quil, I was taller than all of the boys.</p><p>Eventually they got their growth spurts and we all started to go through puberty. Embry and I got more flirty in our physicality. Me jumping on his back randomly, or running at him and having him catch me. Wrestling matches where one of us would let the other pin us so we could meet eyes and be close. Me teaching him how to dance. Him constantly wrapping his arms around my waist and shoulders. When he asked m to the dance and we kissed, everyone was just relieved it had finally happened so they wouldn\u2019t have to deal with our angst and longing.</p><p>I thought of the way he smiled when he kissed me for the first time, hands on my waist and my arms resting on his shoulders while we slow danced. After, we closed our eyes, moving slowly with our foreheads pressed together. Him quietly asking if I would be his girlfriend and both of us giggling as I said yes. That first month we COULDN\u2019T stop touching each other. That awkward time after where we learned self control but still wanted to touch each other all the time and had to learn when we and when wasn\u2019t the appropriate times.</p><p>I thought of his breath on my neck and he whispered, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; for the first time. It took us a while because people kept nagging about how young we were so much that it scared us, but I was thrilled and eagerly said it back, kissing him again. &ldquo;I\u2019m serious,&rdquo; he said after my wild giggles died down. &ldquo;I love you. I know I\u2019m a kid or whatever, but when we grow up I\u2019m going to marry you Y/n L/n.\u201d</p><p>I had blushed so hard. &quot;You won\u2019t.&rdquo;</p><p>He had grinned. &ldquo;Bet.&rdquo; I would soon learn that that word was always followed by a fierce, driven action. One that he would do no matter what obstacles stood in his way.</p><p>And yet, it seemed, something had stood in the way of that first promise.

Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly.</b></p><p>Fifteen and wildly in love. To be so free\u2026</p><p>I\u2019d been told plenty of times how lucky I was. How insanely, crazy lucky I was that I had found Embry Call. They didn\u2019t have to tell me, though, I KNEW I was lucky. I knew that he looked at me like no other boy his age could ever even dream of looking at a girl. He treated me better and thought more long term than sometimes even I did.</p><p>Sometimes I wondered what it was about me that made him this way. He had never been like this before (trust me I\u2019d asked) and he could be so immature and childish that in the moments of earnest and true love, I worried that maybe I was working with two people who looked exactly the same\u2026</p><p>He was wild. Loving him was being on a rollercoaster, rarely ever calm and slow unless it was building up to something major. He was fun, but I fell in love with him because of the way he held me when I cried.</p><p>There was something mesermizing about him. About his laugh and how he tied his hair back and the way his eyebrows wiggles when he made a sex joke that would have made a nine year old tattle tell and a twelve year old holler with laughter. There was something in the way he kissed me that left me both completely satisfied and also dying for more. Something about the way he scooped me up when I wasn\u2019t paying attention or how he said my name when he wanted to cuddle or how he drew his last name next to mine that made me wonder if he was joking or daydreaming.</p><p>We\u2019d been dating a year and a half. We\u2019d gotten together when we were fourteen. Fourteen! We were sixteen now. Weird. It seemed insane and stupid and impossible but we never stopped. A year rolled around and then almost another and we were still here.</p><p>His arms around me felt like armor and I leaned back into him, smiling even though I was doing homework. \u201cI love you, Call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, y/l/n.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ven hesitate, but it didn\u2019t feel casual either. He enunciated it by leaving a kiss on my neck and I felt my smile soften. The sparks and insanity and bubbly feelings went away, but my happiness when being with him never did. He didn\u2019t spark me like a car engine starting, but he made me happy and I could do the same for him. That\u2019s all that would matter as long as we would allow it.</p><p>After a second, I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this, Em,\u201d I whined. My head rested against his shoulder as he leaned forward to look closely at what I was working on, his hair tickling my jaw.</p><p>A sigh as heavy as mine escaped him. \u201cWhy is your math so much harder than mine? We\u2019re both sophomores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hate me more.\u201d He scoffed, humored, but I feigned seriousness. \u201cThose teachers have a creepy adult crush on you. It\u2019s probably your smile. Or your eyes. Your hair. Your laugh. Your-\u201d he moved to come face to face with me, his darker skin tinted with a blush. \u201cLips,\u201d I finished, smirking.</p><p>He kissed me and I grinned. When we parted I turned on my side, pushing my homework away with my foot before curling into Embry and closing my eyes. \u201cYou have to do this,\u201d he reminded me. \u201cYou\u2019re already behind- your mom is going to ground you. And I\u2019m all she ever grounds you from anymore.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to laugh, I groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t make me, Em this stuff is murder!\u201d</p><p>His nose traced along my neck and I sighed contentedly. \u201cDo it for me?\u201d I huffed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a kiss every time you get a problem right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll give me a kiss either way,\u201d I pointed out.\u201c</p><p>He leaned away. \"No I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Opened my eyes, I rose an eyebrow. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay in the same room as me and not kiss me, Call, but you can be cute and pretend to try.\u201d</p><p>His eyes set and I knew hat I had just set of World War three. \u201cBet.\u201d</p><p>I made the mistake and indeed bet.</p><p>Now I was sitting here, on my back as he leaned against the doorframe, looking at me with a smirk on his face but frustration in his eyes. I pouted. \u201cEm,\u201d I whined.</p><p>His face screwed up in concentration and I knew I\u2019d suceeded in making it harder to say no to me. \u201cDo your work and I\u2019ll give you a kiss,\u201d he offered rather casually and calmly.</p><p>I got an idea, smirking as I sat up and leaned over to do a problem. It took me a good few seconds but I pushed myself, pumped by my idea and anticipation. He came and sat next to me to make sure I was actually doing my work, probably surprised I\u2019d broken so quickly. When I finished, I sat back, grinning at him. \u201cI get a kiss now.\u201d</p><p>Embry searched my face for a few seconds, his eyebrows curled in doubt. Before he could find anything, though, I rolled my eyes and grabbed his collar, bringing his lips to mine. He made a half moan on the feeling of impact, his hand instinctively moving to my neck, his thumb caressing my jaw. I let nature take over and followed the flow of my wants - which I usually had to calm but was going to let completely lose now.</p><p>Moving and turning, I got to my knees without breaking the kiss, causing him to lean back a bit. I then moved into his lap, straddling him purposefully so that I grinned against him. He gasped and I smirked, my hands moving into his hair to wrap in the long strands and tug slightly. Another moan escaped him, muffled and low and longer than the first. His hands moved to my waist, gripping me tightly and pulling me close. My tongue ran along his bottom lip and he let me in without even a pause, enjoying the rare show of dominance. My hands moved again, this time breaking the kiss only a second to take my shirt off.</p><p>The house was empty and this was SO much better than doing homework. I kissed him again and his hands flattened against my exposed sides and stomach. He went to pull me close but then groaned and pushed me away. I went back in to kiss him again but he turned his head. \u201cYou need to do homework,\u201d he reminded me, his voice huskier than usual.</p><p>Determined, I moved to kissing his neck, my teeth and lips moving across his warm skin. He hummed in appreciation. \u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered seductively. \u201cI want you, Em.\u201d</p><p>He pushed me away, his eyes darkened with lust as he tried to control himself. \u201cY/n, you are going to do your homework.\u201d I glared at him, crawling off and returning to my after school hell. He leaned close, his fingers grazing my bra clasp as he whispered, \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll fuck you senseless.\u201d</p><p>Who needed much more motivation than that?</p><p>-</p><p>I remember the day it all fell apart.</p><p>Embry Call was a lot of things, but he was very rarely ever angry. Never was he as violently angry as he was now.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around my wrist, pulling me closer. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you just LISTEN?\u201d My eyes widened and I flinched. I wasn\u2019t scared of him but he was being rough and aggressive and I didn\u2019t like it. \u201cWhy did you go to that party? You could have been hurt!\u201d</p><p>Ripping my arm away was harder than I thought and I ended up just pulling him closer. He was intimidating when angry. \u201cI had it under control,\u201d I promised calmly, trying to process this sudden turn in his personality. He worried, sure, but usually when I did something stupid he\u2019d wrap me in a hug and kiss me and tell me how stupid I was and tell me to at least involve him next time so he could keep an eye on me\u2026</p><p>Now he was pissed. \u201cYou broke down on the road and just WALKED home? Your phone died? You didn\u2019t answer any of my calls and texts- Y/n I thought we\u2019d have to find your body somewhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbry, I\u2019m sorry okay? It wasn\u2019t-Hey, that hurts!\u201d His eyes widened and his face relaxed as I exclaimed, loosening his grip on my wrist so that I could rip it away, my other hand rubbing the throbbing skin gently. My eyes watered and I felt stupid crying. I should be yelling at him, or leaving the house and ignoring him for a very long time. Make sure he NEVER did something like this again. But I was shocked. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I got caught up in the moment.</p><p>His eyes searched mine and then looked to my wrist. \u201cDid- did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot badly,\u201d I comforted. \u201cLook, you need to calm down okay? What\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, eyes widening. \u201cNot badly? Y/n, did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened and then closed. I frowned. \u201cA little bit,\u201d I admitted begrudgingly. Embry took another step back until his legs bumped into the couch and then he basically collapsed on it. My eyes went wide and I forgot my wrist in favor of rushing the few steps to kneel next him. My hand went to his forehead. \u201cEm you\u2019re burning up\u2026 Come on let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d I carried him to his room, helping take his shirt and shoes off and laying him in bed to be wrapped in blankets- how he always slept. \u201cI\u2019ll bring over some soup tomorrow,\u201d I whispered. \u201cFor now, stay warm and go to sleep. Now. You need rest. I\u2019ll get you a glass of water for when you wake up because you\u2019ll need lots of fluids. Maybe you should-\u201d</p><p>He caught my wrist, gently. The same wrist he\u2019d held in an iron grip earlier. His eyes were sad as he looked at my hand, tugging me closer so he could kiss my wrist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His voice broke and he suddenly looked so exhausted and worn out that my heart broke too.</p><p>Kneeling next to his bed, I wiped his hair out of his face. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I eased. \u201cJust don\u2019t do that again okay? Ever.\u201d He nodded. I huffed. \u201cWell you\u2019ve never done anything like that before and you were worried sick and actually not feeling well, so I\u2019ll excuse it once.\u201d We exchanged a smile. \u201cNow I\u2019ll get that water and then head home, okay? Sleep.\u201d</p><p>As I went to leave the room, Embry asked, \u201cHow did I get so lucky to have you?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled to myself. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know, Call.\u201d As I promised, I got him a cup of water, kissed him goodbye, and headed home. I went right to sleep so I could wake up early the next morning and make him the soup I\u2019d promised. Homemade, my mom\u2019s recipe. I brought it to Embry\u2019s house, smiling when his mother answered.</p><p>Her face was sad though and my smile wavered. \"He says for you not to come in right now, dear. He\u2019s just gotten worse than yesterday, Jacob Black\u2019s father brought Sam Uley came over when I called to ask him if he knew anything about it\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, hun, but they said it\u2019s really contagious.\u201d</p><p>My heart fell but I nodded, wondering where I\u2019d heard that name before. Sam Uley. It sounded way too familiar to not be able to tie it to something, but I couldn\u2019t place exactly where I\u2019d heard it before. \u201cWell, give this to him will you?\u201d I asked, holding up my bowl of soup.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cAw, how sweet! He\u2019ll love this, thank you, I will. Hope to see you soon, dear.\u201d And then she went inside and I stepped away from the house, sighing heavily. I moved to Embry\u2019s window after a small pause, my fingers reaching up to tap three times, pause, tap two times, pause, and then tap once. This was our secret code: 3, 2, 1. And then he would response with 1, 2, 3.</p><p>The response never came.</p><p>Dismissing it since he was probably asleep, I turned away from the house and went back to my own again. I\u2019d be able to talk to him again soon- I could last a few days\u2026</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t see Embry Call again for far longer than just a few days.</p><p><b>Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you\u2019re already flying through the free fall. Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.</b></p><p>I can\u2019t help but think of how we met as I sit here by myself.</p><p>We were young, in middle school. I\u2019d loved next to Jacob Black as long as I remembered but I was awkward and kind of a loner because I was too boyish and rough to hang out with the girls and boys didn\u2019t want me because I was a girl. A snotty girl had shoved me in the hallway, and I lashed out because I would not let this even start. I was ending this- NOW. I was not the kind of person to lay down and take anything; you don\u2019t mess with me.</p><p>After I went off on her and she attempted to shove me again, I pushed her onto her ass, tackling her to the ground and pinning her arms with my legs and using my hands to slam down next to either side of her face, startling her. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I enunciated. \u201cDo that.\u201d</p><p>A teacher had begun to come over so I scrambled off of her. She started crying and I got sent to the principals office, but after I explained everything, thy called us both in, made us truce, and that was it. She left me alone, and so did everyone else.</p><p>Completely alone\u2026 as usual.</p><p>On my way home from school, Jacob caught up to me. \u201cThe way you stood up to that girl was crazy cool.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, excited by the idea of a new friend.

Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly.</b></p><p>Fifteen and wildly in love. To be so free\u2026</p><p>I\u2019d been told plenty of times how lucky I was. How insanely, crazy lucky I was that I had found Embry Call. They didn\u2019t have to tell me, though, I KNEW I was lucky. I knew that he looked at me like no other boy his age could ever even dream of looking at a girl. He treated me better and thought more long term than sometimes even I did.</p><p>Sometimes I wondered what it was about me that made him this way. He had never been like this before (trust me I\u2019d asked) and he could be so immature and childish that in the moments of earnest and true love, I worried that maybe I was working with two people who looked exactly the same\u2026</p><p>He was wild. Loving him was being on a rollercoaster, rarely ever calm and slow unless it was building up to something major. He was fun, but I fell in love with him because of the way he held me when I cried.</p><p>There was something mesermizing about him. About his laugh and how he tied his hair back and the way his eyebrows wiggles when he made a sex joke that would have made a nine year old tattle tell and a twelve year old holler with laughter. There was something in the way he kissed me that left me both completely satisfied and also dying for more. Something about the way he scooped me up when I wasn\u2019t paying attention or how he said my name when he wanted to cuddle or how he drew his last name next to mine that made me wonder if he was joking or daydreaming.</p><p>We\u2019d been dating a year and a half. We\u2019d gotten together when we were fourteen. Fourteen! We were sixteen now. Weird. It seemed insane and stupid and impossible but we never stopped. A year rolled around and then almost another and we were still here.</p><p>His arms around me felt like armor and I leaned back into him, smiling even though I was doing homework. \u201cI love you, Call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, y/l/n.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ven hesitate, but it didn\u2019t feel casual either. He enunciated it by leaving a kiss on my neck and I felt my smile soften. The sparks and insanity and bubbly feelings went away, but my happiness when being with him never did. He didn\u2019t spark me like a car engine starting, but he made me happy and I could do the same for him. That\u2019s all that would matter as long as we would allow it.</p><p>After a second, I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this, Em,\u201d I whined. My head rested against his shoulder as he leaned forward to look closely at what I was working on, his hair tickling my jaw.</p><p>A sigh as heavy as mine escaped him. \u201cWhy is your math so much harder than mine? We\u2019re both sophomores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hate me more.\u201d He scoffed, humored, but I feigned seriousness. \u201cThose teachers have a creepy adult crush on you. It\u2019s probably your smile. Or your eyes. Your hair. Your laugh. Your-\u201d he moved to come face to face with me, his darker skin tinted with a blush. \u201cLips,\u201d I finished, smirking.</p><p>He kissed me and I grinned. When we parted I turned on my side, pushing my homework away with my foot before curling into Embry and closing my eyes. \u201cYou have to do this,\u201d he reminded me. \u201cYou\u2019re already behind- your mom is going to ground you. And I\u2019m all she ever grounds you from anymore.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to laugh, I groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t make me, Em this stuff is murder!\u201d</p><p>His nose traced along my neck and I sighed contentedly. \u201cDo it for me?\u201d I huffed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a kiss every time you get a problem right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll give me a kiss either way,\u201d I pointed out.\u201c</p><p>He leaned away. \"No I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Opened my eyes, I rose an eyebrow. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay in the same room as me and not kiss me, Call, but you can be cute and pretend to try.\u201d</p><p>His eyes set and I knew hat I had just set of World War three. \u201cBet.\u201d</p><p>I made the mistake and indeed bet.</p><p>Now I was sitting here, on my back as he leaned against the doorframe, looking at me with a smirk on his face but frustration in his eyes. I pouted. \u201cEm,\u201d I whined.</p><p>His face screwed up in concentration and I knew I\u2019d suceeded in making it harder to say no to me. \u201cDo your work and I\u2019ll give you a kiss,\u201d he offered rather casually and calmly.</p><p>I got an idea, smirking as I sat up and leaned over to do a problem. It took me a good few seconds but I pushed myself, pumped by my idea and anticipation. He came and sat next to me to make sure I was actually doing my work, probably surprised I\u2019d broken so quickly. When I finished, I sat back, grinning at him. \u201cI get a kiss now.\u201d</p><p>Embry searched my face for a few seconds, his eyebrows curled in doubt. Before he could find anything, though, I rolled my eyes and grabbed his collar, bringing his lips to mine. He made a half moan on the feeling of impact, his hand instinctively moving to my neck, his thumb caressing my jaw. I let nature take over and followed the flow of my wants - which I usually had to calm but was going to let completely lose now.</p><p>Moving and turning, I got to my knees without breaking the kiss, causing him to lean back a bit. I then moved into his lap, straddling him purposefully so that I grinned against him. He gasped and I smirked, my hands moving into his hair to wrap in the long strands and tug slightly. Another moan escaped him, muffled and low and longer than the first. His hands moved to my waist, gripping me tightly and pulling me close. My tongue ran along his bottom lip and he let me in without even a pause, enjoying the rare show of dominance. My hands moved again, this time breaking the kiss only a second to take my shirt off.</p><p>The house was empty and this was SO much better than doing homework. I kissed him again and his hands flattened against my exposed sides and stomach. He went to pull me close but then groaned and pushed me away. I went back in to kiss him again but he turned his head. \u201cYou need to do homework,\u201d he reminded me, his voice huskier than usual.</p><p>Determined, I moved to kissing his neck, my teeth and lips moving across his warm skin. He hummed in appreciation. \u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered seductively. \u201cI want you, Em.\u201d</p><p>He pushed me away, his eyes darkened with lust as he tried to control himself. \u201cY/n, you are going to do your homework.\u201d I glared at him, crawling off and returning to my after school hell. He leaned close, his fingers grazing my bra clasp as he whispered, \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll fuck you senseless.\u201d</p><p>Who needed much more motivation than that?</p><p>-</p><p>I remember the day it all fell apart.</p><p>Embry Call was a lot of things, but he was very rarely ever angry. Never was he as violently angry as he was now.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around my wrist, pulling me closer. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you just LISTEN?\u201d My eyes widened and I flinched. I wasn\u2019t scared of him but he was being rough and aggressive and I didn\u2019t like it. \u201cWhy did you go to that party? You could have been hurt!\u201d</p><p>Ripping my arm away was harder than I thought and I ended up just pulling him closer. He was intimidating when angry. \u201cI had it under control,\u201d I promised calmly, trying to process this sudden turn in his personality. He worried, sure, but usually when I did something stupid he\u2019d wrap me in a hug and kiss me and tell me how stupid I was and tell me to at least involve him next time so he could keep an eye on me\u2026</p><p>Now he was pissed. \u201cYou broke down on the road and just WALKED home? Your phone died? You didn\u2019t answer any of my calls and texts- Y/n I thought we\u2019d have to find your body somewhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbry, I\u2019m sorry okay? It wasn\u2019t-Hey, that hurts!\u201d His eyes widened and his face relaxed as I exclaimed, loosening his grip on my wrist so that I could rip it away, my other hand rubbing the throbbing skin gently. My eyes watered and I felt stupid crying. I should be yelling at him, or leaving the house and ignoring him for a very long time. Make sure he NEVER did something like this again. But I was shocked. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I got caught up in the moment.</p><p>His eyes searched mine and then looked to my wrist. \u201cDid- did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot badly,\u201d I comforted. \u201cLook, you need to calm down okay? What\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, eyes widening. \u201cNot badly? Y/n, did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened and then closed. I frowned. \u201cA little bit,\u201d I admitted begrudgingly. Embry took another step back until his legs bumped into the couch and then he basically collapsed on it. My eyes went wide and I forgot my wrist in favor of rushing the few steps to kneel next him. My hand went to his forehead. \u201cEm you\u2019re burning up\u2026 Come on let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d I carried him to his room, helping take his shirt and shoes off and laying him in bed to be wrapped in blankets- how he always slept. \u201cI\u2019ll bring over some soup tomorrow,\u201d I whispered. \u201cFor now, stay warm and go to sleep. Now. You need rest. I\u2019ll get you a glass of water for when you wake up because you\u2019ll need lots of fluids. Maybe you should-\u201d</p><p>He caught my wrist, gently. The same wrist he\u2019d held in an iron grip earlier. His eyes were sad as he looked at my hand, tugging me closer so he could kiss my wrist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His voice broke and he suddenly looked so exhausted and worn out that my heart broke too.</p><p>Kneeling next to his bed, I wiped his hair out of his face. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I eased. \u201cJust don\u2019t do that again okay? Ever.\u201d He nodded. I huffed. \u201cWell you\u2019ve never done anything like that before and you were worried sick and actually not feeling well, so I\u2019ll excuse it once.\u201d We exchanged a smile. \u201cNow I\u2019ll get that water and then head home, okay? Sleep.\u201d</p><p>As I went to leave the room, Embry asked, \u201cHow did I get so lucky to have you?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled to myself. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know, Call.\u201d As I promised, I got him a cup of water, kissed him goodbye, and headed home. I went right to sleep so I could wake up early the next morning and make him the soup I\u2019d promised. Homemade, my mom\u2019s recipe. I brought it to Embry\u2019s house, smiling when his mother answered.</p><p>Her face was sad though and my smile wavered. \"He says for you not to come in right now, dear. He\u2019s just gotten worse than yesterday, Jacob Black\u2019s father brought Sam Uley came over when I called to ask him if he knew anything about it\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, hun, but they said it\u2019s really contagious.\u201d</p><p>My heart fell but I nodded, wondering where I\u2019d heard that name before. Sam Uley. It sounded way too familiar to not be able to tie it to something, but I couldn\u2019t place exactly where I\u2019d heard it before. \u201cWell, give this to him will you?\u201d I asked, holding up my bowl of soup.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cAw, how sweet! He\u2019ll love this, thank you, I will. Hope to see you soon, dear.\u201d And then she went inside and I stepped away from the house, sighing heavily. I moved to Embry\u2019s window after a small pause, my fingers reaching up to tap three times, pause, tap two times, pause, and then tap once. This was our secret code: 3, 2, 1. And then he would response with 1, 2, 3.</p><p>The response never came.</p><p>Dismissing it since he was probably asleep, I turned away from the house and went back to my own again. I\u2019d be able to talk to him again soon- I could last a few days\u2026</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t see Embry Call again for far longer than just a few days.</p><p><b>Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you\u2019re already flying through the free fall. Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.</b></p><p>I can\u2019t help but think of how we met as I sit here by myself.</p><p>We were young, in middle school. I\u2019d loved next to Jacob Black as long as I remembered but I was awkward and kind of a loner because I was too boyish and rough to hang out with the girls and boys didn\u2019t want me because I was a girl. A snotty girl had shoved me in the hallway, and I lashed out because I would not let this even start. I was ending this- NOW. I was not the kind of person to lay down and take anything; you don\u2019t mess with me.</p><p>After I went off on her and she attempted to shove me again, I pushed her onto her ass, tackling her to the ground and pinning her arms with my legs and using my hands to slam down next to either side of her face, startling her. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I enunciated. \u201cDo that.\u201d</p><p>A teacher had begun to come over so I scrambled off of her. She started crying and I got sent to the principals office, but after I explained everything, thy called us both in, made us truce, and that was it. She left me alone, and so did everyone else.</p><p>Completely alone\u2026 as usual.</p><p>On my way home from school, Jacob caught up to me. \u201cThe way you stood up to that girl was crazy cool.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, excited by the idea of a new friend. The two of us really hit it off and he invited me to hang out with him and his friends. I of course agreed. When the time came and I finally met Embry and Quil, I was taller than all of the boys.</p><p>Eventually they got their growth spurts and we all started to go through puberty. Embry and I got more flirty in our physicality. Me jumping on his back randomly, or running at him and having him catch me. Wrestling matches where one of us would let the other pin us so we could meet eyes and be close. Me teaching him how to dance. Him constantly wrapping his arms around my waist and shoulders. When he asked m to the dance and we kissed, everyone was just relieved it had finally happened so they wouldn\u2019t have to deal with our angst and longing.</p><p>I thought of the way he smiled when he kissed me for the first time, hands on my waist and my arms resting on his shoulders while we slow danced. After, we closed our eyes, moving slowly with our foreheads pressed together. Him quietly asking if I would be his girlfriend and both of us giggling as I said yes. That first month we COULDN\u2019T stop touching each other. That awkward time after where we learned self control but still wanted to touch each other all the time and had to learn when we and when wasn\u2019t the appropriate times.</p><p>I thought of his breath on my neck and he whispered, \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time. It took us a while because people kept nagging about how young we were so much that it scared us, but I was thrilled and eagerly said it back, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said after my wild giggles died down. \u201cI love you. I know I\u2019m a kid or whatever, but when we grow up I\u2019m going to marry you Y/n L/n.\u201d</p><p>I had blushed so hard. \"You won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He had grinned. \u201cBet.\u201d I would soon learn that that word was always followed by a fierce, driven action. One that he would do no matter what obstacles stood in his way.</p><p>And yet, it seemed, something had stood in the way of that first promise. That first challenge he\u2019d so fervently accepted, grinning as wide and mischievously as if I\u2019d just challenged him to a race or an eating competition.</p><p>How silly it all seemed now, to believe that an immature love born in near childhood could ever surpass to adulthood. Ridiculous, that I believed we would really make it.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t talked in weeks. I saw him at school but I\u2019d long realized he was avoiding me and didn\u2019t want to talk to me. I\u2019d tried to face him a ton of times. First to tell him off, and then just to get answers. Were we even still together? The one time I finally caught up with him he snapped at me that I wasn\u2019t getting the message and then broke up with me. In front of all of his new friends. Sam Uley and that gang. Yeah, I\u2019d remembered where I\u2019d heard the name before. Sam Uley, the ring leader of the gang that before Embry had only mentioned with loathing. He stood there with his buddies, not even looking at me as he sneered at me to get lost.</p><p>He seemed normal otherwise. His hair he cut short and he kissed a surprising amount of school but otherwise he seemed to be pretty upbeat and positive around Sam and the others.</p><p>Our love was fiery and passionate and full of life and fun. Few boundaries or hesitation. It was impossible not to fall for him. Too thrilling and enticing. It had lasted just long enough to make me believe that it would go forever, too. Just long enough to make me dare believe, even after all of the warnings and promises and attempts of other people that tried to get through my skull. I still believed. Defended Embry and me and us. </p><p>I guess we were as doomed as everyone had said\u2026</p><p>-</p><p>Forever Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlBd-WaK7BasX3MeySuDOzQ\">@bitchyseawitch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0FFm1xHm69D76Lc1wSzv9g\">@alexa-playafricabytoto</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ-9MTTp-87OMQrs3VnIAdA\">@chipster-21</a> </p></p>",

Your phone died? You didn&rsquo;t answer any of my calls and texts- Y/n I thought we&rsquo;d have to find your body somewhere!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Embry, I&rsquo;m sorry okay? It wasn&rsquo;t-Hey, that hurts!&rdquo; His eyes widened and his face relaxed as I exclaimed, loosening his grip on my wrist so that I could rip it away, my other hand rubbing the throbbing skin gently. My eyes watered and I felt stupid crying. I should be yelling at him, or leaving the house and ignoring him for a very long time. Make sure he NEVER did something like this again. But I was shocked. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do and I got caught up in the moment.</p><p>His eyes searched mine and then looked to my wrist. &ldquo;Did- did I hurt you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not badly,&rdquo; I comforted. &ldquo;Look, you need to calm down okay? What&rsquo;s gotten into you?&rdquo;</p><p>He stepped back, eyes widening. &ldquo;Not badly? Y/n, did I hurt you?&rdquo;</p><p>My mouth opened and then closed. I frowned. &ldquo;A little bit,&rdquo; I admitted begrudgingly. Embry took another step back until his legs bumped into the couch and then he basically collapsed on it. My eyes went wide and I forgot my wrist in favor of rushing the few steps to kneel next him. My hand went to his forehead. &ldquo;Em you&rsquo;re burning up&hellip; Come on let&rsquo;s get you to bed.&rdquo; I carried him to his room, helping take his shirt and shoes off and laying him in bed to be wrapped in blankets- how he always slept. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring over some soup tomorrow,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;For now, stay warm and go to sleep. Now. You need rest. I&rsquo;ll get you a glass of water for when you wake up because you&rsquo;ll need lots of fluids. Maybe you should-&rdquo;</p><p>He caught my wrist, gently. The same wrist he&rsquo;d held in an iron grip earlier. His eyes were sad as he looked at my hand, tugging me closer so he could kiss my wrist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; His voice broke and he suddenly looked so exhausted and worn out that my heart broke too.</p><p>Kneeling next to his bed, I wiped his hair out of his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I eased. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t do that again okay? Ever.&rdquo; He nodded. I huffed. &ldquo;Well you&rsquo;ve never done anything like that before and you were worried sick and actually not feeling well, so I&rsquo;ll excuse it once.&rdquo; We exchanged a smile. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll get that water and then head home, okay? Sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>As I went to leave the room, Embry asked, &ldquo;How did I get so lucky to have you?&rdquo;</p><p>I chuckled to myself. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never know, Call.&rdquo; As I promised, I got him a cup of water, kissed him goodbye, and headed home. I went right to sleep so I could wake up early the next morning and make him the soup I&rsquo;d promised. Homemade, my mom&rsquo;s recipe. I brought it to Embry&rsquo;s house, smiling when his mother answered.</p><p>Her face was sad though and my smile wavered. \"He says for you not to come in right now, dear. He&rsquo;s just gotten worse than yesterday, Jacob Black&rsquo;s father brought Sam Uley came over when I called to ask him if he knew anything about it&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry, hun, but they said it&rsquo;s really contagious.&rdquo;</p><p>My heart fell but I nodded, wondering where I&rsquo;d heard that name before. Sam Uley. It sounded way too familiar to not be able to tie it to something, but I couldn&rsquo;t place exactly where I&rsquo;d heard it before. &ldquo;Well, give this to him will you?&rdquo; I asked, holding up my bowl of soup.</p><p>She grinned. &ldquo;Aw, how sweet! He&rsquo;ll love this, thank you, I will. Hope to see you soon, dear.&rdquo; And then she went inside and I stepped away from the house, sighing heavily. I moved to Embry&rsquo;s window after a small pause, my fingers reaching up to tap three times, pause, tap two times, pause, and then tap once. This was our secret code: 3, 2, 1. And then he would response with 1, 2, 3.</p><p>The response never came.</p><p>Dismissing it since he was probably asleep, I turned away from the house and went back to my own again. I&rsquo;d be able to talk to him again soon- I could last a few days&hellip;</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t see Embry Call again for far longer than just a few days.</p><p><b>Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you&rsquo;re already flying through the free fall. Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.</b></p><p>I can&rsquo;t help but think of how we met as I sit here by myself.</p><p>We were young, in middle school. I&rsquo;d loved next to Jacob Black as long as I remembered but I was awkward and kind of a loner because I was too boyish and rough to hang out with the girls and boys didn&rsquo;t want me because I was a girl. A snotty girl had shoved me in the hallway, and I lashed out because I would not let this even start. I was ending this- NOW. I was not the kind of person to lay down and take anything; you don&rsquo;t mess with me.</p><p>After I went off on her and she attempted to shove me again, I pushed her onto her ass, tackling her to the ground and pinning her arms with my legs and using my hands to slam down next to either side of her face, startling her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I enunciated. &ldquo;Do that.&rdquo;</p><p>A teacher had begun to come over so I scrambled off of her. She started crying and I got sent to the principals office, but after I explained everything, thy called us both in, made us truce, and that was it. She left me alone, and so did everyone else.</p><p>Completely alone&hellip; as usual.</p><p>On my way home from school, Jacob caught up to me. &ldquo;The way you stood up to that girl was crazy cool.&rdquo;</p><p>I grinned, excited by the idea of a new friend. The two of us really hit it off and he invited me to hang out with him and his friends. I of course agreed. When the time came and I finally met Embry and Quil, I was taller than all of the boys.</p><p>Eventually they got their growth spurts and we all started to go through puberty. Embry and I got more flirty in our physicality. Me jumping on his back randomly, or running at him and having him catch me. Wrestling matches where one of us would let the other pin us so we could meet eyes and be close. Me teaching him how to dance. Him constantly wrapping his arms around my waist and shoulders. When he asked m to the dance and we kissed, everyone was just relieved it had finally happened so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with our angst and longing.</p><p>I thought of the way he smiled when he kissed me for the first time, hands on my waist and my arms resting on his shoulders while we slow danced. After, we closed our eyes, moving slowly with our foreheads pressed together. Him quietly asking if I would be his girlfriend and both of us giggling as I said yes. That first month we COULDN&rsquo;T stop touching each other. That awkward time after where we learned self control but still wanted to touch each other all the time and had to learn when we and when wasn&rsquo;t the appropriate times.</p><p>I thought of his breath on my neck and he whispered, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; for the first time. It took us a while because people kept nagging about how young we were so much that it scared us, but I was thrilled and eagerly said it back, kissing him again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; he said after my wild giggles died down. &ldquo;I love you. I know I&rsquo;m a kid or whatever, but when we grow up I&rsquo;m going to marry you Y/n L/n.&rdquo;</p><p>I had blushed so hard. \"You won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>He had grinned. &ldquo;Bet.&rdquo; I would soon learn that that word was always followed by a fierce, driven action. One that he would do no matter what obstacles stood in his way.</p><p>And yet, it seemed, something had stood in the way of that first promise. That first challenge he&rsquo;d so fervently accepted, grinning as wide and mischievously as if I&rsquo;d just challenged him to a race or an eating competition.</p><p>How silly it all seemed now, to believe that an immature love born in near childhood could ever surpass to adulthood. Ridiculous, that I believed we would really make it.</p><p>We hadn&rsquo;t talked in weeks. I saw him at school but I&rsquo;d long realized he was avoiding me and didn&rsquo;t want to talk to me. I&rsquo;d tried to face him a ton of times. First to tell him off, and then just to get answers. Were we even still together? The one time I finally caught up with him he snapped at me that I wasn&rsquo;t getting the message and then broke up with me. In front of all of his new friends. Sam Uley and that gang. Yeah, I&rsquo;d remembered where I&rsquo;d heard the name before. Sam Uley, the ring leader of the gang that before Embry had only mentioned with loathing. He stood there with his buddies, not even looking at me as he sneered at me to get lost.</p><p>He seemed normal otherwise. His hair he cut short and he kissed a surprising amount of school but otherwise he seemed to be pretty upbeat and positive around Sam and the others.</p><p>Our love was fiery and passionate and full of life and fun. Few boundaries or hesitation. It was impossible not to fall for him. Too thrilling and enticing. It had lasted just long enough to make me believe that it would go forever, too. Just long enough to make me dare believe, even after all of the warnings and promises and attempts of other people that tried to get through my skull. I still believed. Defended Embry and me and us. </p><p>I guess we were as doomed as everyone had said&hellip;</p><p>-</p><p>Forever Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlBd-WaK7BasX3MeySuDOzQ\">@bitchyseawitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0FFm1xHm69D76Lc1wSzv9g\">@alexa-playafricabytoto</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ-9MTTp-87OMQrs3VnIAdA\">@chipster-21</a> </p></p>",
