            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

        "body": "<p>Here\u2019s my first review post on Game of Thrones! Thank you so much for asking about Daenerys, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcnzBwaPrc2gQ2VMN48k0SQ\">@bixgirl1</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFQpd1kJ8RIOLfUXWO_-CWQ\">@kikibluemay</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1z2RaI-2RUZEKgc2mEB2iA\">@oceaxe-ifdawn</a>. She was fascinating and tragic, and I couldn\u2019t really stop talking about her&hellip; as in, I ended up writing a 4k+ word essay on her character.</p><p>Due to the length, I\u2019ve crossed-posted to AO3 for those who prefer to read it there:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19119595\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/19119595</a>\u00a0. As usual, never feel obliged to do anything! Fandom is a happy, carefree place for me :) .</p><!-- more --><p>Before I start, I\u2019d like to say this\u2014I\u2019ve never expected GoT to be progressive. Its medieval aesthetics aside, the gratuitous violence and nudity really seal the deal. Therefore, this review is written decidedly without a social justice lens; I shall not argue if the showrunners were feminists, racists, imperialists etc. Also, I haven\u2019t read the books and have read few metas and reviews; so these are my unfiltered thoughts and of course, my personal opinion. I got interested in Game of Thrones because the snippets I knew of it reminded me of ancient Chinese history, which I loved for its twists, its very blurred lines between truths and myths, its cynical record of human nature, clever strategies and bloodshed. Along this vein, I was, and still am, the most interested in how each contender of the Iron Throne got there, and as the theme of the story emerged (\u201cthe lies we spin, our fates they weave\u201d is my way of describing it), the things they told for motivation\u2014the lies and truths that, should they win, would become history.</p><p>Of all the contenders and their stories, Daenerys\u2019 rise was the most\u2026mythical and uplifting. She was easy to root for, partly because we\u2019re conditioned to root for heroes like her. The last descendant of a dynasty. Orphan. Exiled, abused, went through her personal journey from little better than a slave to become queen. She even birthed dragons and rode them to war. I really enjoyed the part of her story as the Khaleesi. She grew into a queen in every way, and an ideal one, by the time led her small group of followers across the desert. I loved her\u2014she was strong, resilient, intelligent, righteous. And she understood and respected a culture that was supposedly far below her (as her brother Viserys frequently reminded everyone).\u00a0</p><p>But then came Astapor, then Yunkai, then Meereen. She became a true ruler, without a Khal by her side\u2026\u00a0</p><p>I started feeling a little uncomfortable. I was puzzled by that. Her cause was emancipation, one I believe was absolutely correct. Her stance was uncompromising. She walked the walk. Every single one of these traits was beyond admirable, and precious among rulers. Nailing 163 slave masters for 163 children might seem brutal, but the world of GoT *was* brutal.\u00a0</p><p>And yet, something felt&hellip;off.</p><p>Then I realized: after all the screen time in Meereen, I remained very much ignorant of the place, other than it practiced slavery. Slavery\u2014and the barbaric practices surrounding it, such as the fighting pits\u2014was presented as the only thing that defined her new constituents in her eyes. This could be by design, to show Daenerys\u2019 \u201cstyle\u201d as a ruler. This can also be a reflection of the showrunners\u2019 perspectives, their disquiet about tackling slavery for a larger audience.\u00a0 But if I must judge the show by its own merits and ignore the hands behind it, the repeated shots of Daenerys sitting high in the Great Pyramid, she and her advisors donned in their foreign attire, telling the locals who looked nothing like them, over and over again, that they were wrong\u2026\u00a0</p><p>She looked like a coloniser. My radars were beeping for that reason. I grew up in a colony, a well cared for one (ie, it would\u2019ve fared far worse if it hadn\u2019t been colonised). Colonialism is therefore an integral part of my life, and my views of it are coloured and educated by the experience. Controversial point:  far from a general rule, but I recognise that colonizers can do great good. I\u2019m a beneficiary of that myself. However, I\u2019ve also learned that there\u2019s an art to bringing these great goods to the colonised. One lesson: defining these people, especially when they\u2019re foreign to the ruler, with anything that the ruler is seeking to eradicate \u2014 a habit, a tradition, a set of beliefs\u2026 \u2014is not a recipe for success. It\u2019s a matter of human pride\u2014the pride of, in this case, the people who\u2019d just suffered defeat. The former ruling class needs to feel some respect, which translates to a sense of security, for any transition of power to be smooth. One may say, the slave masters deserved neither pride nor respect nor security; this is very true, but there was a very practical consideration, one that Daenerys acknowledged: the ultimate goal of conquest is to rule. An un-governable colony won\u2019t change for the better, because it won\u2019t remain a colony for long. In Meereen, as in many real-world colonies, colonisers were few and their constituents were many. Revolts would favour the latter, in particular, the former ruling class who often had both financial and geographical advantages. The Sons of Harpy\u2019s revolt did address that, albeit weakly.</p><p>No, I don\u2019t mean Daenerys should yield on the issue of slavery. Lives were at stake and the emancipation had to be immediate. But then, merely insisting this was the right thing to do and punishing offenders with increasing severity, while reinforcing the segregation between the ruling class and the ruled (Daenerys pretty much sequestered herself in the Great Pyramid), was not a direction to take to render the emancipation permanent. Daenerys had to be out there. She had to make serious effort to find common grounds in the 3-way between herself, the former slaves and former slave owners, especially after she\u2019d removed one of the pillars of Meereen\u2019s sociopolitical structure. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the latter were despicable; she had to find a connection. And being a nation that had stood thousands of years, with its wealth and fine architecture, Meereen had got to have something benign and beautiful that Queen Daenerys could embrace, that she could use as a bridge to endear her to her constituents and at the same time, de-emphasize the role of slavery in defining what Meereen was. Wear their clothes. Visit the temples. Whether she actually believed in their gods didn\u2019t matter. Join their festivities\u2014if she did it enough it would matter much less if she skipped the fighting pits. Go to their Flea\u2019s Bottom equivalent (as Margaery Tyrell did in King\u2019s Landing; she would\u2019ve made a good colonial governor). Talk to their craftsman and ask about their traditional crafts. Never for once did Daenerys consider these strategies. She could\u2019ve used Tyrion as her ambassador\u2014his stature and broken language skills, if utilized correctly, could loosen people\u2019s defense, and the parties he\u2019d attend would give him access to the good wines he craved and the setting for him to establish alliances with small talks. If governing foreign lands is indeed an art form, Daenerys didn\u2019t pursue it in Meereen, even though from her time with the Dothrakis, it seemed unlikely that she was ignorant of its necessity (She did eat a horse heart for her Khal and her unborn child).</p><p>Again, assuming that the writers were merely following GRRM\u2019s guideposts on her character arc, I had to contend with these possibilities that inform me about Daenerys the Ruler: 1) somewhere in her journey in Essos, she\u2019d lost her ability to empathize with the cultures under her rule. This seemed unlikely. Or, 2) she no longer felt the need to do it, her power no longer derived from a Khal.\u00a0Either way, with Westeros also being foreign to Daenerys, I started to wonder the kind of ruler she would end up being \u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u2026 and it looked rather similar to the Daenerys in her final scenes, asserting that her moral compass should make the entire Westeros bent their knees. I started to wonder if the show intended this to be a good or bad thing, or something more nuanced, as it should be. My hopes weren\u2019t high\u2014after all, our own western world still retains much of its colonial sensibilities, which would\u2019ve (rightly) praised Daenerys\u2019 role as a Liberator, but would also (sub)consciously downplay her \u2026 colonising tendencies.\u00a0</p><p>Does it mean I see Daenerys as a bad person, or going mad? Not at all. Conflating character and ability to rule is, IMO, one of the major weaknesses of her ending (more on that later); it was also, perhaps ironically, Daenerys\u2019 own fatal mistake. My question is merely one about her fitness to rule, which is itself a fluid thing. War-time rulers require different skills compared to peace-time rulers, conquerors to defenders. The serious contenders of the Iron Throne each had their own strengths, some better suited for rulership and some better for rulership at different times. Stannis was a strong general but was too easily swayed as a ruler. Daenerys was a conqueror. Jon Snow was a diplomat.\u00a0</p><p>One thing, however, is true and consistent in the world of GoT: to gain power, being morally righteous is not enough. Ned Stark\u2019s detached head brought this point across all too well. Rulers win the hearts of their people. Not the brains, not the logic that decides what is right or wrong. Humans are inherently passionate about power, whether it\u2019s theirs to own or not.</p><p>And this is, perhaps, Daenerys Stormborn\u2019s greatest tragedy. She assumed her strict moral compass, along with her birthright and strong will, would be sufficient to take her to the Iron Throne. Her dragons further misguided her in that regard\u2014punishments by Dracarys lent an extra mythical weight and poetry to her judgments, as if she had a higher power, like God, on her side. When she asked Jon Snow if she was to rule with love or fear, she asked as if the two were a dichotomy, seemingly blind to the fact that she had always treaded the line between the two. Love got her the Unsullied, the talents who came far and wide to advise her; fear got her the Dothrakis, the fragile peace in Essos.\u00a0</p><p>If you\u2019ve read till here (thank you), you may assume I\u2019d defend Daenerys\u2019 decision to burn King\u2019s Landing, or suggest it was foreshadowed. I\u2019d say this: I find it to be within the realms of possibility, but only given my personal opinion about her rule in Meereen. I don\u2019t see it as a botched coin-flip by the Gods, because nothing in her prior judgment suggested madness. Yes, she\u2019d ignored advice before, but no more than, say, Robert Baratheon or Joffrey (Cersei simply killed those who gave her advice she didn\u2019t like). Daenerys\u2019 decision to march to King\u2019s Landing immediately after the Battle of Winterfell\u2014the last major decision she made before the sacking\u2014might not be wise to some but was logically sound. I\u2019d also venture to say this, perhaps in defence of the show\u2019s writers: I\u2019m also not quite sure if the show intended her decision to be a proof of madness.\u00a0</p><p>Because I\u2019m not sure if the madness told in this show was real at all.\u00a0</p><p>Because curiously, while the coin flip had been mentioned several times, the show never offered us any concrete, visual evidence that Daenerys had suffered a loss of reason, which defines madness for us who live on Earth in the 21st century. The destruction of King\u2019s Landing was portrayed at the ground level; we didn\u2019t exactly see Daenerys cackling, or enjoying the carnage. Making a terrible decision does not a mad person make. She was seen to be sure of herself in her final scene with Jon Snow\u2014but why shouldn\u2019t she be, when she\u2019d just emerged victorious and achieved her life\u2019s goal, her revenge? If cockiness had been the mark of madness, half of the characters in the show would\u2019ve been mad.\u00a0</p><p>Even more curious to me is this: people like Ramsey or Joffrey or Cersei, who\u2019d done seriously mad things in our perspective, were never once described as \u201cmad\u201d. The adjective \u201cMad\u201d had always been reserved for the Mad King.\u00a0</p><p>How was the Mad King mad then? This is important, because Daenerys supposedly inherited his madness. But the audience hadn\u2019t been given much information. We know The Mad King killed his dissidents, but that seemed to fall within standard monarch behaviour. We know he and his advisors\u2014including, notably, Varys\u2014were at increasing odds with each other, but put a bunch of power-hungry men with immense power imbalance in the same room and that would happen more likely than not. He killed Ned Stark\u2019s father and brother in a confrontation\u2014so he was vengeful, distrustful, and brutal, yes, just like Joffrey or Cersei, but still, nothing that spoke particularly of madness. He was said to want King\u2019s Landing destroyed, but the act was never realized; we only learned of his intentions via Jaimie. He set up the network of wildfires, which were terrible weapons but also \u2026 traditional in the Targaryen dynasty, if wildfires had indeed been invented as replacements of Dracarys. So how mad was actually the Mad King then, compared to his ancestors? Or was he called Mad only because he lost his game of thrones, and history was written by victors? When Varys claimed to be worried about Daenerys\u2019 state\u2014when he hinted at her madness and being a bad coin flip\u2014was he merely repeating the same lies that had been told about her father, with the purpose of setting up a chain reaction that would propel Jon Snow to the Iron Throne, as the same lies had helped justify and cement Robert Baratheon\u2019s reign? Varys might have been trying to feed Daenerys something. A \u201ccrazy potion\u201d, maybe? \u00a0</p><p>Yes, I know. I\u2019m probably reading too much into this. It\u2019s my wishful thinking, perhaps, to not see Daenerys as mad (or the writers writing her as mad) because that would\u2019ve taken away her agency. Because Daenerys\u2019 character arc doesn\u2019t deserve an ending equivalent to death by a falling flowerpot. Because, if her sacking of King\u2019s Landing was meant to be the Shock of Season 8, she must retain her agency. It\u2019s shocking because a good person did it. A good person is good only when she has the agency to make terrible mistakes.</p><p>So how am I reading Daenerys\u2019 decision to sack King\u2019s Landing? If I were to ignore all inputs outside the show\u2014I don\u2019t know if the showrunners had commented on anything\u2014this is how I would \u201cbridge the gap\u201d, so to speak; how I\u2019d imagine the thoughts running through Daenery\u2019s mind as the bells rang, behind the few seconds the camera focused on Emilia Clark\u2019s face in the show. I believe the series of tragedies Daenerys had suffered (losing Jorah, Missandei, a dragon son) had only made her more determined to wipe out, as Greyworm told Jon, everyone who\u2019d served Cersei. But while this sounded like a simple task, carrying it out was much more complicated. Cersei\u2019s armies were dispersed all over the city; they could easily remove their armour and feign innocence. Moreover, every resident in King\u2019s Landing could be seen as an accomplice to Cersei\u2019s reign; even the people in Flea\u2019s Bottom, like Gendry, used to make weapons for the Lannisters. Were they to be wiped out as well? If not, where to draw the line? This order nonetheless confirmed Daenerys\u2019 world view that the morally corrupt should perish without mercy, and Cersei was, indeed, corruption defined. Daenerys had seen Cersei\u2019s treachery herself, and the sheer scale of it must be as foreign to her as Westeros itself. Her closest friends and followers, Greyworm and Missandei, didn\u2019t even know how to tell a joke\u2014the smallest, most benign form of treachery. Daenerys knew what treachery was, of course, she\u2019d suffered greatly from it, but treachery in the game of thrones was a different beast and she wasn\u2019t yet equipped to handle it, to make correct assessments of the kind of behaviours it\u2019d instigate\u2014unlike Cersei and Tyrion, who as Lannisters had been breathing it in since birth, or Varys, who\u2019d been both an observer of multiple reigns and a ruthless Kingmaker himself. King\u2019s Landing, the city itself, had also signified little but treachery to Daenerys\u2014her father had been murdered there by someone who\u2019d sworn to protect him; men had been sent from there to murder her since she\u2019d been born.\u00a0</p><p>While Tyrion had told said that Cersei\u2019s armies were serving only out of fear, Daenerys, who\u2019d only had the most faithful / honest armies, the Unsullies and Dothrakis, probably couldn\u2019t truly appreciate what that meant. She had every cause to be terrified then when the bells rang, especially when they rang so early, without her or her army and allies even close to the Red Keep. Ironically, perhaps, her own moral righteousness became her blind spot; she might have assumed Cersei\u2019s forces had something far more sinister waiting for her\u2014because how could they abandon their duties, their queen so easily?</p><p>And if they did abandon their duties and their queen so easily, what would stop them from committing the same treachery when Daenerys becomes queen herself? How could she vet the innocent and the treacherous and if she couldn\u2019t\u2014and she couldn\u2019t, not with one dragon, a small army and no geographical advantage\u2014what could she do? What could she do, when she was Daenerys Stormborn, who would never compromise to treachery?</p><p>I can see her feeling cornered. I can see her feeling she was left with one option: take the innocents out with the treachery. Do it like removing a tumour. Cut out a ring of good flesh around the bad.\u00a0</p><p>The ring of good flesh was King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Plausible? Maybe? That tragically, both the rise and fall of Daenerys Targaryen could be attributed to her moral code? That she didn\u2019t lose this game of thrones because she was evil, but because war and politics have always been amoral and she was a misfit? People in Westeros change allegiance all the time; morals are fluid and carry a price tag. Appropriately then, the man who understood and lived by these rules, whose loyalty could always be bought\u2014Bronn\u2014was also the biggest winner of this game of thrones.</p><p>I\u2019d say this though:\u00a0 a plot point as significant, and as close to the finale as the sacking of King\u2019s Landing, shouldn\u2019t require the audience twisting their minds into pretzels to make it feel plausible, and my brain feels a bit pretzly at a moment. No matter what the writers intended, there remained too many holes for the watchers to fill with their imagination. I\u2019ve read some who said the final season was too rushed; I\u2019m not sure that was the issue. The issue, I think, is that even if given enough screen time, the writers didn\u2019t quite know how to drive the characters without the books\u2019 guidance\u2014an issue that had become apparent by Season 6. The last three seasons felt\u2026derivative, like fanfics of the first four. This isn\u2019t a slight (well, not a big one)\u2014Benioff and Weiss had managed what GRRM hasn\u2019t been able to\u2014but I felt a sense that their visions of the world had evolved to conflict with GRRM\u2019s over the course of the show. Meanwhile, they still<i> needed </i>to hit the goal posts GRRM provided, while they <i>wanted</i> to focus on / believe in something else. The result was the later seasons that felt \u2026schizophrenic at times. GoT had highly implausible moments since Season 1, but the first four seasons sold them because the showrunners believed in them. S8 Ep5&amp;6, meanwhile, offered enough for me to logically agree that the sacking of King\u2019s Landing and Daenerys\u2019 downfall can be canon, but not enough for me to believe emotionally because\u2026I didn\u2019t feel the showrunners believed in them. The events felt written to serve a purpose other than storytelling\u2014maybe to match GRRM\u2019s notes, or satisfy the perceived need to shock; in all cases, I felt the hearts of the writers were somewhere else, somewhere perhaps more spectacular than dissecting the motivations of a fallen queen. The shift towards visual storytelling in the later seasons, perhaps to mitigate the difficulty of writing dialogues for an ensemble of deeply complex and intertwined characters, furthered exposed the incoherence of the show\u2019s focus. While I love the visuals, GoT had its origins as a political show and politics is 99% talk. Similarly, the increased reliance on the actors to convey their characters via facial expressions and body language might work for someone like Brienne, who was taciturn and largely consistent personality wise, but insufficient for characters who used talking as a weapon (Tyrion) or underwent major transformations (Daenerys).\u00a0</p><p>Anyway, back to Dany. If there was one thing I truly, truly dislike about the close of her story arc, it was the very end, when Jon Snow drove that dagger into her. Painfully cliche aside (I\u2019ll leave Cersei\u2019s baby to another day), it also unfairly cemented Daenery\u2019s highly un-rightful place as the villain of the story, given that Jon Snow, the uncontested Good Human of the show, committed the murder. The show pitted two sympathetic characters against each other just to let one \u2026 leech the sympathy out of the other, when neither of their characters deserved the treatment (yes, I found this decision to be as unfair to Jon Snow as it was to Daenerys). As much as I had reservations about Daenery\u2019s ability to govern, I never doubted the heart that Jon stabbed, the desire in it to do good for the people. Yes, I said it isn\u2019t enough, and yes, I believe that too inflexible a moral code forcibly imposed upon others can do great damage, but this is very different from saying that Daenerys Stormborn was a villain. Conflating character and ability is human, but I expected this show to know enough nuance to avoid this mistake. Having the heart, the desire to rule well, is a start. A great and important start. A start seen in few others in the whole series. The early seasons of GoT were particularly strong in depicting characters in the grey but Daenerys, sadly, was robbed of that; she swung violently from white to black.</p><p>And what was so disappointing is that it needn\u2019t be that way. Daenerys could have caused the destruction to King\u2019s Landing and still be sympathetic. Queen Cersei was still in the Red Keep, and the Wildfires buried by the Mad King remained all over the city. Innocents die in wars, there\u2019s never an exception to that, even if the wars are waged with the best intentions. I\u2019m no show writer, but this is what I could come up with to spare Daenery\u2019s fate as a villain after a few walking trips around my city, while keeping most major plot points intact. Show writers can do (much) better.\u00a0</p><p>Just for the fun of it, below is the alternative ending for Daenerys I came up with, and I will end my very, very long thesis here :) . Thank you so, so much for reading! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f</p><p>===</p><p>1) Start of the episode. Qyburn teaching his little birds a nursery rhyme about a Mad King and his Wildfires, and an Evil Queen who will set them all burning. He tells them to sing far and wide. (This is just an excuse to get another song from Ramin Djawadi)</p><p>2) Long shots of combustibles being laid in the same tunnels Lancel Lannister crawled through back in Season 6 Ep 10, before the explosion of the Sept of Baelor. That 10-minute sequence was so classic that the audience would likely remember the place. Piles of wood connect the stores of barrels that we know contain the Wildfires. Black tar flows down the sewers of the Red Keep, down the alleys in Flea Bottom, slicking everything, staining the innocents there with (Queen Cersei\u2019s) muck. This sequence can be done entirely through visuals.</p><p>3) The Bell rings. Daenerys attacks the Red Keep with Dracarys. The tar and wood catch fire and carry the flames to the Wildfires around the city. As Wildfire is Dracarys\u2019 substitute, the two augments each other and the city soon turns into an Inferno. Daenerys watches, horrified and unable to do a thing. The nursery rhyme becomes a prophecy: as much as a Lannister laid the grounds, the Targaryens are solely responsible for the King\u2019s Landing destruction. Woods and tar are, after all, harmless without fire. And Daenerys Stormborn, who swore to protect and liberate the weak, ends up killing more innocents than Cersei ever had.\u00a0</p><p>4) Tyrion advises Daenerys that for now, she has no choice but to rule by fear. A reign cannot start with apologies, and what good will it do? So Daenerys gives the same speech to her armies on the steps of the ruined Red Keep, but noticeably distraught.</p><p>5) Daenerys must also restrain Drogon. She can\u2019t afford him accidentally setting more fires in the city, while her armies scour every tunnel to make sure all Wildfires have been consumed. So the Breaker of Chains is forced to chain down her son, the symbol of her power.</p><p>6) Drogon, being intelligent but still a beast, maims Daenerys badly in his struggle to be free. Jon finds Daenerys, but she\u2019s beyond saving. She tells Jon to keep what he saw secret, and if he can\u2019t\u2014she knows he can\u2019t\u2014to please lie for her, for once, that Drogon did it to avenge for the innocents she killed; that Drogon, and their family name he represents, knows justice above the fire and blood. When honest Jon reacts\u2026honestly, she asks him to ask Tyrion for advice. She struggles to stand, says she wants to try the Iron Throne before she goes. She refuses Jon\u2019s help; she walks, head high, blood trailing like a cape behind her, as she crosses the ruins. She won\u2019t make it. Only her finger will get to touch the Iron Throne, as in her prophecy in the House of the Undying. Jon kneels behind her as she falls on her own knees. She will always be his queen. Drogon carries her away.</p><p>7) The waiting period can be a mourning period for all who have perished. Tyrion will still recommend Bran to be their King, as his proposal will be accepted as he remains the Hand. Jon would\u2019ve asked Tyrion about the lying, and the issue can be brought up when \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d is presented in the small council. King Bran can then offer his wisdom as the Three-Eyed Raven, the Living History. What does he think, when he sees both the truth in history and the lies and prophecies told about it, that propel it? Does he approve of them? Disapprove? This will also wrap up the theme of the show, about the stories that make history, the history that makes us. Ser Davos can ask about the legend of Azor Ahai that cost Stannis Baratheon everything. Is it true? Does it matter? Also, how many swords actually make up the Iron Throne? Thousands, as the legends and Daenarys had believed? No more than two hundred, as Little Finger said in Season One? How many more swords have been buried for these thousands or hundreds?</p>",

As usual, never feel obliged to do anything! Fandom is a happy, carefree place for me :) .</p>[[MORE]]<p>Before I start, I\u2019d like to say this\u2014I\u2019ve never expected GoT to be progressive. Its medieval aesthetics aside, the gratuitous violence and nudity really seal the deal. Therefore, this review is written decidedly without a social justice lens; I shall not argue if the showrunners were feminists, racists, imperialists etc. Also, I haven\u2019t read the books and have read few metas and reviews; so these are my unfiltered thoughts and of course, my personal opinion. I got interested in Game of Thrones because the snippets I knew of it reminded me of ancient Chinese history, which I loved for its twists, its very blurred lines between truths and myths, its cynical record of human nature, clever strategies and bloodshed. Along this vein, I was, and still am, the most interested in how each contender of the Iron Throne got there, and as the theme of the story emerged (\u201cthe lies we spin, our fates they weave\u201d is my way of describing it), the things they told for motivation\u2014the lies and truths that, should they win, would become history.</p><p>Of all the contenders and their stories, Daenerys\u2019 rise was the most\u2026mythical and uplifting. She was easy to root for, partly because we\u2019re conditioned to root for heroes like her. The last descendant of a dynasty. Orphan. Exiled, abused, went through her personal journey from little better than a slave to become queen. She even birthed dragons and rode them to war. I really enjoyed the part of her story as the Khaleesi. She grew into a queen in every way, and an ideal one, by the time led her small group of followers across the desert. I loved her\u2014she was strong, resilient, intelligent, righteous. And she understood and respected a culture that was supposedly far below her (as her brother Viserys frequently reminded everyone).\u00a0</p><p>But then came Astapor, then Yunkai, then Meereen. She became a true ruler, without a Khal by her side\u2026\u00a0</p><p>I started feeling a little uncomfortable. I was puzzled by that. Her cause was emancipation, one I believe was absolutely correct. Her stance was uncompromising. She walked the walk. Every single one of these traits was beyond admirable, and precious among rulers. Nailing 163 slave masters for 163 children might seem brutal, but the world of GoT *was* brutal.\u00a0</p><p>And yet, something felt\u2026off.</p><p>Then I realized: after all the screen time in Meereen, I remained very much ignorant of the place, other than it practiced slavery. Slavery\u2014and the barbaric practices surrounding it, such as the fighting pits\u2014was presented as the only thing that defined her new constituents in her eyes. This could be by design, to show Daenerys\u2019 \u201cstyle\u201d as a ruler. This can also be a reflection of the showrunners\u2019 perspectives, their disquiet about tackling slavery for a larger audience.\u00a0 But if I must judge the show by its own merits and ignore the hands behind it, the repeated shots of Daenerys sitting high in the Great Pyramid, she and her advisors donned in their foreign attire, telling the locals who looked nothing like them, over and over again, that they were wrong\u2026\u00a0</p><p>She looked like a coloniser. My radars were beeping for that reason. I grew up in a colony, a well cared for one (ie, it would\u2019ve fared far worse if it hadn\u2019t been colonised). Colonialism is therefore an integral part of my life, and my views of it are coloured and educated by the experience. Controversial point:  far from a general rule, but I recognise that colonizers can do great good. I\u2019m a beneficiary of that myself. However, I\u2019ve also learned that there\u2019s an art to bringing these great goods to the colonised. One lesson: defining these people, especially when they\u2019re foreign to the ruler, with anything that the ruler is seeking to eradicate \u2014 a habit, a tradition, a set of beliefs\u2026 \u2014is not a recipe for success. It\u2019s a matter of human pride\u2014the pride of, in this case, the people who\u2019d just suffered defeat. The former ruling class needs to feel some respect, which translates to a sense of security, for any transition of power to be smooth. One may say, the slave masters deserved neither pride nor respect nor security; this is very true, but there was a very practical consideration, one that Daenerys acknowledged: the ultimate goal of conquest is to rule. An un-governable colony won\u2019t change for the better, because it won\u2019t remain a colony for long. In Meereen, as in many real-world colonies, colonisers were few and their constituents were many. Revolts would favour the latter, in particular, the former ruling class who often had both financial and geographical advantages. The Sons of Harpy\u2019s revolt did address that, albeit weakly.</p><p>No, I don\u2019t mean Daenerys should yield on the issue of slavery. Lives were at stake and the emancipation had to be immediate. But then, merely insisting this was the right thing to do and punishing offenders with increasing severity, while reinforcing the segregation between the ruling class and the ruled (Daenerys pretty much sequestered herself in the Great Pyramid), was not a direction to take to render the emancipation permanent. Daenerys had to be out there. She had to make serious effort to find common grounds in the 3-way between herself, the former slaves and former slave owners, especially after she\u2019d removed one of the pillars of Meereen\u2019s sociopolitical structure. It didn\u2019t matter that the latter were despicable; she had to find a connection. And being a nation that had stood thousands of years, with its wealth and fine architecture, Meereen had got to have something benign and beautiful that Queen Daenerys could embrace, that she could use as a bridge to endear her to her constituents and at the same time, de-emphasize the role of slavery in defining what Meereen was. Wear their clothes. Visit the temples. Whether she actually believed in their gods didn\u2019t matter. Join their festivities\u2014if she did it enough it would matter much less if she skipped the fighting pits. Go to their Flea\u2019s Bottom equivalent (as Margaery Tyrell did in King\u2019s Landing; she would\u2019ve made a good colonial governor). Talk to their craftsman and ask about their traditional crafts. Never for once did Daenerys consider these strategies. She could\u2019ve used Tyrion as her ambassador\u2014his stature and broken language skills, if utilized correctly, could loosen people\u2019s defense, and the parties he\u2019d attend would give him access to the good wines he craved and the setting for him to establish alliances with small talks. If governing foreign lands is indeed an art form, Daenerys didn\u2019t pursue it in Meereen, even though from her time with the Dothrakis, it seemed unlikely that she was ignorant of its necessity (She did eat a horse heart for her Khal and her unborn child).</p><p>Again, assuming that the writers were merely following GRRM\u2019s guideposts on her character arc, I had to contend with these possibilities that inform me about Daenerys the Ruler: 1) somewhere in her journey in Essos, she\u2019d lost her ability to empathize with the cultures under her rule. This seemed unlikely. Or, 2) she no longer felt the need to do it, her power no longer derived from a Khal.\u00a0Either way, with Westeros also being foreign to Daenerys, I started to wonder the kind of ruler she would end up being \u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u2026 and it looked rather similar to the Daenerys in her final scenes, asserting that her moral compass should make the entire Westeros bent their knees. I started to wonder if the show intended this to be a good or bad thing, or something more nuanced, as it should be. My hopes weren\u2019t high\u2014after all, our own western world still retains much of its colonial sensibilities, which would\u2019ve (rightly) praised Daenerys\u2019 role as a Liberator, but would also (sub)consciously downplay her \u2026 colonising tendencies.\u00a0</p><p>Does it mean I see Daenerys as a bad person, or going mad? Not at all. Conflating character and ability to rule is, IMO, one of the major weaknesses of her ending (more on that later); it was also, perhaps ironically, Daenerys\u2019 own fatal mistake. My question is merely one about her fitness to rule, which is itself a fluid thing. War-time rulers require different skills compared to peace-time rulers, conquerors to defenders. The serious contenders of the Iron Throne each had their own strengths, some better suited for rulership and some better for rulership at different times. Stannis was a strong general but was too easily swayed as a ruler. Daenerys was a conqueror. Jon Snow was a diplomat.\u00a0</p><p>One thing, however, is true and consistent in the world of GoT: to gain power, being morally righteous is not enough. Ned Stark\u2019s detached head brought this point across all too well. Rulers win the hearts of their people. Not the brains, not the logic that decides what is right or wrong. Humans are inherently passionate about power, whether it\u2019s theirs to own or not.</p><p>And this is, perhaps, Daenerys Stormborn\u2019s greatest tragedy. She assumed her strict moral compass, along with her birthright and strong will, would be sufficient to take her to the Iron Throne. Her dragons further misguided her in that regard\u2014punishments by Dracarys lent an extra mythical weight and poetry to her judgments, as if she had a higher power, like God, on her side. When she asked Jon Snow if she was to rule with love or fear, she asked as if the two were a dichotomy, seemingly blind to the fact that she had always treaded the line between the two. Love got her the Unsullied, the talents who came far and wide to advise her; fear got her the Dothrakis, the fragile peace in Essos.\u00a0</p><p>If you\u2019ve read till here (thank you), you may assume I\u2019d defend Daenerys\u2019 decision to burn King\u2019s Landing, or suggest it was foreshadowed. I\u2019d say this: I find it to be within the realms of possibility, but only given my personal opinion about her rule in Meereen. I don\u2019t see it as a botched coin-flip by the Gods, because nothing in her prior judgment suggested madness. Yes, she\u2019d ignored advice before, but no more than, say, Robert Baratheon or Joffrey (Cersei simply killed those who gave her advice she didn\u2019t like). Daenerys\u2019 decision to march to King\u2019s Landing immediately after the Battle of Winterfell\u2014the last major decision she made before the sacking\u2014might not be wise to some but was logically sound. I\u2019d also venture to say this, perhaps in defence of the show\u2019s writers: I\u2019m also not quite sure if the show intended her decision to be a proof of madness.\u00a0</p><p>Because I\u2019m not sure if the madness told in this show was real at all.\u00a0</p><p>Because curiously, while the coin flip had been mentioned several times, the show never offered us any concrete, visual evidence that Daenerys had suffered a loss of reason, which defines madness for us who live on Earth in the 21st century. The destruction of King\u2019s Landing was portrayed at the ground level; we didn\u2019t exactly see Daenerys cackling, or enjoying the carnage. Making a terrible decision does not a mad person make. She was seen to be sure of herself in her final scene with Jon Snow\u2014but why shouldn\u2019t she be, when she\u2019d just emerged victorious and achieved her life\u2019s goal, her revenge? If cockiness had been the mark of madness, half of the characters in the show would\u2019ve been mad.\u00a0</p><p>Even more curious to me is this: people like Ramsey or Joffrey or Cersei, who\u2019d done seriously mad things in our perspective, were never once described as \u201cmad\u201d. The adjective \u201cMad\u201d had always been reserved for the Mad King.\u00a0</p><p>How was the Mad King mad then? This is important, because Daenerys supposedly inherited his madness. But the audience hadn\u2019t been given much information. We know The Mad King killed his dissidents, but that seemed to fall within standard monarch behaviour. We know he and his advisors\u2014including, notably, Varys\u2014were at increasing odds with each other, but put a bunch of power-hungry men with immense power imbalance in the same room and that would happen more likely than not. He killed Ned Stark\u2019s father and brother in a confrontation\u2014so he was vengeful, distrustful, and brutal, yes, just like Joffrey or Cersei, but still, nothing that spoke particularly of madness. He was said to want King\u2019s Landing destroyed, but the act was never realized; we only learned of his intentions via Jaimie. He set up the network of wildfires, which were terrible weapons but also \u2026 traditional in the Targaryen dynasty, if wildfires had indeed been invented as replacements of Dracarys. So how mad was actually the Mad King then, compared to his ancestors? Or was he called Mad only because he lost his game of thrones, and history was written by victors? When Varys claimed to be worried about Daenerys\u2019 state\u2014when he hinted at her madness and being a bad coin flip\u2014was he merely repeating the same lies that had been told about her father, with the purpose of setting up a chain reaction that would propel Jon Snow to the Iron Throne, as the same lies had helped justify and cement Robert Baratheon\u2019s reign? Varys might have been trying to feed Daenerys something. A \u201ccrazy potion\u201d, maybe? \u00a0</p><p>Yes, I know. I\u2019m probably reading too much into this. It\u2019s my wishful thinking, perhaps, to not see Daenerys as mad (or the writers writing her as mad) because that would\u2019ve taken away her agency. Because Daenerys\u2019 character arc doesn\u2019t deserve an ending equivalent to death by a falling flowerpot. Because, if her sacking of King\u2019s Landing was meant to be the Shock of Season 8, she must retain her agency. It\u2019s shocking because a good person did it. A good person is good only when she has the agency to make terrible mistakes.</p><p>So how am I reading Daenerys\u2019 decision to sack King\u2019s Landing? If I were to ignore all inputs outside the show\u2014I don\u2019t know if the showrunners had commented on anything\u2014this is how I would \u201cbridge the gap\u201d, so to speak; how I\u2019d imagine the thoughts running through Daenery\u2019s mind as the bells rang, behind the few seconds the camera focused on Emilia Clark\u2019s face in the show. I believe the series of tragedies Daenerys had suffered (losing Jorah, Missandei, a dragon son) had only made her more determined to wipe out, as Greyworm told Jon, everyone who\u2019d served Cersei. But while this sounded like a simple task, carrying it out was much more complicated. Cersei\u2019s armies were dispersed all over the city; they could easily remove their armour and feign innocence. Moreover, every resident in King\u2019s Landing could be seen as an accomplice to Cersei\u2019s reign; even the people in Flea\u2019s Bottom, like Gendry, used to make weapons for the Lannisters. Were they to be wiped out as well? If not, where to draw the line? This order nonetheless confirmed Daenerys\u2019 world view that the morally corrupt should perish without mercy, and Cersei was, indeed, corruption defined. Daenerys had seen Cersei\u2019s treachery herself, and the sheer scale of it must be as foreign to her as Westeros itself. Her closest friends and followers, Greyworm and Missandei, didn\u2019t even know how to tell a joke\u2014the smallest, most benign form of treachery. Daenerys knew what treachery was, of course, she\u2019d suffered greatly from it, but treachery in the game of thrones was a different beast and she wasn\u2019t yet equipped to handle it, to make correct assessments of the kind of behaviours it\u2019d instigate\u2014unlike Cersei and Tyrion, who as Lannisters had been breathing it in since birth, or Varys, who\u2019d been both an observer of multiple reigns and a ruthless Kingmaker himself. King\u2019s Landing, the city itself, had also signified little but treachery to Daenerys\u2014her father had been murdered there by someone who\u2019d sworn to protect him; men had been sent from there to murder her since she\u2019d been born.\u00a0</p><p>While Tyrion had told said that Cersei\u2019s armies were serving only out of fear, Daenerys, who\u2019d only had the most faithful / honest armies, the Unsullies and Dothrakis, probably couldn\u2019t truly appreciate what that meant. She had every cause to be terrified then when the bells rang, especially when they rang so early, without her or her army and allies even close to the Red Keep. Ironically, perhaps, her own moral righteousness became her blind spot; she might have assumed Cersei\u2019s forces had something far more sinister waiting for her\u2014because how could they abandon their duties, their queen so easily?</p><p>And if they did abandon their duties and their queen so easily, what would stop them from committing the same treachery when Daenerys becomes queen herself? How could she vet the innocent and the treacherous and if she couldn\u2019t\u2014and she couldn\u2019t, not with one dragon, a small army and no geographical advantage\u2014what could she do? What could she do, when she was Daenerys Stormborn, who would never compromise to treachery?</p><p>I can see her feeling cornered. I can see her feeling she was left with one option: take the innocents out with the treachery. Do it like removing a tumour. Cut out a ring of good flesh around the bad.\u00a0</p><p>The ring of good flesh was King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Plausible? Maybe? That tragically, both the rise and fall of Daenerys Targaryen could be attributed to her moral code? That she didn\u2019t lose this game of thrones because she was evil, but because war and politics have always been amoral and she was a misfit? People in Westeros change allegiance all the time; morals are fluid and carry a price tag. Appropriately then, the man who understood and lived by these rules, whose loyalty could always be bought\u2014Bronn\u2014was also the biggest winner of this game of thrones.</p><p>I\u2019d say this though:\u00a0 a plot point as significant, and as close to the finale as the sacking of King\u2019s Landing, shouldn\u2019t require the audience twisting their minds into pretzels to make it feel plausible, and my brain feels a bit pretzly at a moment. No matter what the writers intended, there remained too many holes for the watchers to fill with their imagination. I\u2019ve read some who said the final season was too rushed; I\u2019m not sure that was the issue. The issue, I think, is that even if given enough screen time, the writers didn\u2019t quite know how to drive the characters without the books\u2019 guidance\u2014an issue that had become apparent by Season 6. The last three seasons felt\u2026derivative, like fanfics of the first four. This isn\u2019t a slight (well, not a big one)\u2014Benioff and Weiss had managed what GRRM hasn\u2019t been able to\u2014but I felt a sense that their visions of the world had evolved to conflict with GRRM\u2019s over the course of the show. Meanwhile, they still<i> needed </i>to hit the goal posts GRRM provided, while they <i>wanted</i> to focus on / believe in something else. The result was the later seasons that felt \u2026schizophrenic at times. GoT had highly implausible moments since Season 1, but the first four seasons sold them because the showrunners believed in them. S8 Ep5&amp;6, meanwhile, offered enough for me to logically agree that the sacking of King\u2019s Landing and Daenerys\u2019 downfall can be canon, but not enough for me to believe emotionally because\u2026I didn\u2019t feel the showrunners believed in them. The events felt written to serve a purpose other than storytelling\u2014maybe to match GRRM\u2019s notes, or satisfy the perceived need to shock; in all cases, I felt the hearts of the writers were somewhere else, somewhere perhaps more spectacular than dissecting the motivations of a fallen queen. The shift towards visual storytelling in the later seasons, perhaps to mitigate the difficulty of writing dialogues for an ensemble of deeply complex and intertwined characters, furthered exposed the incoherence of the show\u2019s focus. While I love the visuals, GoT had its origins as a political show and politics is 99% talk. Similarly, the increased reliance on the actors to convey their characters via facial expressions and body language might work for someone like Brienne, who was taciturn and largely consistent personality wise, but insufficient for characters who used talking as a weapon (Tyrion) or underwent major transformations (Daenerys).\u00a0</p><p>Anyway, back to Dany. If there was one thing I truly, truly dislike about the close of her story arc, it was the very end, when Jon Snow drove that dagger into her. Painfully cliche aside (I\u2019ll leave Cersei\u2019s baby to another day), it also unfairly cemented Daenery\u2019s highly un-rightful place as the villain of the story, given that Jon Snow, the uncontested Good Human of the show, committed the murder. The show pitted two sympathetic characters against each other just to let one \u2026 leech the sympathy out of the other, when neither of their characters deserved the treatment (yes, I found this decision to be as unfair to Jon Snow as it was to Daenerys). As much as I had reservations about Daenery\u2019s ability to govern, I never doubted the heart that Jon stabbed, the desire in it to do good for the people. Yes, I said it isn\u2019t enough, and yes, I believe that too inflexible a moral code forcibly imposed upon others can do great damage, but this is very different from saying that Daenerys Stormborn was a villain. Conflating character and ability is human, but I expected this show to know enough nuance to avoid this mistake. Having the heart, the desire to rule well, is a start. A great and important start. A start seen in few others in the whole series. The early seasons of GoT were particularly strong in depicting characters in the grey but Daenerys, sadly, was robbed of that; she swung violently from white to black.</p><p>And what was so disappointing is that it needn\u2019t be that way. Daenerys could have caused the destruction to King\u2019s Landing and still be sympathetic. Queen Cersei was still in the Red Keep, and the Wildfires buried by the Mad King remained all over the city. Innocents die in wars, there\u2019s never an exception to that, even if the wars are waged with the best intentions. I\u2019m no show writer, but this is what I could come up with to spare Daenery\u2019s fate as a villain after a few walking trips around my city, while keeping most major plot points intact. Show writers can do (much) better.\u00a0</p><p>Just for the fun of it, below is the alternative ending for Daenerys I came up with, and I will end my very, very long thesis here :) . Thank you so, so much for reading! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f</p><p>===</p><p>1) Start of the episode. Qyburn teaching his little birds a nursery rhyme about a Mad King and his Wildfires, and an Evil Queen who will set them all burning. He tells them to sing far and wide. (This is just an excuse to get another song from Ramin Djawadi)</p><p>2) Long shots of combustibles being laid in the same tunnels Lancel Lannister crawled through back in Season 6 Ep 10, before the explosion of the Sept of Baelor. That 10-minute sequence was so classic that the audience would likely remember the place. Piles of wood connect the stores of barrels that we know contain the Wildfires. Black tar flows down the sewers of the Red Keep, down the alleys in Flea Bottom, slicking everything, staining the innocents there with (Queen Cersei\u2019s) muck. This sequence can be done entirely through visuals.</p><p>3) The Bell rings. Daenerys attacks the Red Keep with Dracarys. The tar and wood catch fire and carry the flames to the Wildfires around the city. As Wildfire is Dracarys\u2019 substitute, the two augments each other and the city soon turns into an Inferno. Daenerys watches, horrified and unable to do a thing. The nursery rhyme becomes a prophecy: as much as a Lannister laid the grounds, the Targaryens are solely responsible for the King\u2019s Landing destruction. Woods and tar are, after all, harmless without fire. And Daenerys Stormborn, who swore to protect and liberate the weak, ends up killing more innocents than Cersei ever had.\u00a0</p><p>4) Tyrion advises Daenerys that for now, she has no choice but to rule by fear. A reign cannot start with apologies, and what good will it do? So Daenerys gives the same speech to her armies on the steps of the ruined Red Keep, but noticeably distraught.</p><p>5) Daenerys must also restrain Drogon. She can\u2019t afford him accidentally setting more fires in the city, while her armies scour every tunnel to make sure all Wildfires have been consumed. So the Breaker of Chains is forced to chain down her son, the symbol of her power.</p><p>6) Drogon, being intelligent but still a beast, maims Daenerys badly in his struggle to be free. Jon finds Daenerys, but she\u2019s beyond saving. She tells Jon to keep what he saw secret, and if he can\u2019t\u2014she knows he can\u2019t\u2014to please lie for her, for once, that Drogon did it to avenge for the innocents she killed; that Drogon, and their family name he represents, knows justice above the fire and blood. When honest Jon reacts\u2026honestly, she asks him to ask Tyrion for advice. She struggles to stand, says she wants to try the Iron Throne before she goes. She refuses Jon\u2019s help; she walks, head high, blood trailing like a cape behind her, as she crosses the ruins. She won\u2019t make it. Only her finger will get to touch the Iron Throne, as in her prophecy in the House of the Undying. Jon kneels behind her as she falls on her own knees. She will always be his queen. Drogon carries her away.</p><p>7) The waiting period can be a mourning period for all who have perished. Tyrion will still recommend Bran to be their King, as his proposal will be accepted as he remains the Hand. Jon would\u2019ve asked Tyrion about the lying, and the issue can be brought up when \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d is presented in the small council. King Bran can then offer his wisdom as the Three-Eyed Raven, the Living History. What does he think, when he sees both the truth in history and the lies and prophecies told about it, that propel it? Does he approve of them? Disapprove? This will also wrap up the theme of the show, about the stories that make history, the history that makes us. Ser Davos can ask about the legend of Azor Ahai that cost Stannis Baratheon everything. Is it true? Does it matter? Also, how many swords actually make up the Iron Throne? Thousands, as the legends and Daenarys had believed? No more than two hundred, as Little Finger said in Season One? How many more swords have been buried for these thousands or hundreds?</p>",

Thank you so much for asking about Daenerys, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcnzBwaPrc2gQ2VMN48k0SQ\">@bixgirl1</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFQpd1kJ8RIOLfUXWO_-CWQ\">@kikibluemay</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1z2RaI-2RUZEKgc2mEB2iA\">@oceaxe-ifdawn</a>. She was fascinating and tragic, and I couldn\u2019t really stop talking about her\u2026 as in, I ended up writing a 4k+ word essay on her character.</p><p>Due to the length, I\u2019ve crossed-posted to AO3 for those who prefer to read it there:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19119595\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/19119595</a>\u00a0. As usual, never feel obliged to do anything! Fandom is a happy, carefree place for me :) .</p>[[MORE]]<p>Before I start, I\u2019d like to say this\u2014I\u2019ve never expected GoT to be progressive. Its medieval aesthetics aside, the gratuitous violence and nudity really seal the deal. Therefore, this review is written decidedly without a social justice lens; I shall not argue if the showrunners were feminists, racists, imperialists etc. Also, I haven\u2019t read the books and have read few metas and reviews; so these are my unfiltered thoughts and of course, my personal opinion. I got interested in Game of Thrones because the snippets I knew of it reminded me of ancient Chinese history, which I loved for its twists, its very blurred lines between truths and myths, its cynical record of human nature, clever strategies and bloodshed. Along this vein, I was, and still am, the most interested in how each contender of the Iron Throne got there, and as the theme of the story emerged (\u201cthe lies we spin, our fates they weave\u201d is my way of describing it), the things they told for motivation\u2014the lies and truths that, should they win, would become history.</p><p>Of all the contenders and their stories, Daenerys\u2019 rise was the most\u2026mythical and uplifting. She was easy to root for, partly because we\u2019re conditioned to root for heroes like her. The last descendant of a dynasty. Orphan. Exiled, abused, went through her personal journey from little better than a slave to become queen. She even birthed dragons and rode them to war. I really enjoyed the part of her story as the Khaleesi. She grew into a queen in every way, and an ideal one, by the time led her small group of followers across the desert. I loved her\u2014she was strong, resilient, intelligent, righteous. And she understood and respected a culture that was supposedly far below her (as her brother Viserys frequently reminded everyone).\u00a0</p><p>But then came Astapor, then Yunkai, then Meereen. She became a true ruler, without a Khal by her side\u2026\u00a0</p><p>I started feeling a little uncomfortable. I was puzzled by that. Her cause was emancipation, one I believe was absolutely correct. Her stance was uncompromising. She walked the walk. Every single one of these traits was beyond admirable, and precious among rulers. Nailing 163 slave masters for 163 children might seem brutal, but the world of GoT *was* brutal.\u00a0</p><p>And yet, something felt\u2026off.</p><p>Then I realized: after all the screen time in Meereen, I remained very much ignorant of the place, other than it practiced slavery. Slavery\u2014and the barbaric practices surrounding it, such as the fighting pits\u2014was presented as the only thing that defined her new constituents in her eyes. This could be by design, to show Daenerys\u2019 \u201cstyle\u201d as a ruler. This can also be a reflection of the showrunners\u2019 perspectives, their disquiet about tackling slavery for a larger audience.\u00a0 But if I must judge the show by its own merits and ignore the hands behind it, the repeated shots of Daenerys sitting high in the Great Pyramid, she and her advisors donned in their foreign attire, telling the locals who looked nothing like them, over and over again, that they were wrong\u2026\u00a0</p><p>She looked like a coloniser. My radars were beeping for that reason. I grew up in a colony, a well cared for one (ie, it would\u2019ve fared far worse if it hadn\u2019t been colonised). Colonialism is therefore an integral part of my life, and my views of it are coloured and educated by the experience. Controversial point:  far from a general rule, but I recognise that colonizers can do great good. I\u2019m a beneficiary of that myself. However, I\u2019ve also learned that there\u2019s an art to bringing these great goods to the colonised. One lesson: defining these people, especially when they\u2019re foreign to the ruler, with anything that the ruler is seeking to eradicate \u2014 a habit, a tradition, a set of beliefs\u2026 \u2014is not a recipe for success. It\u2019s a matter of human pride\u2014the pride of, in this case, the people who\u2019d just suffered defeat. The former ruling class needs to feel some respect, which translates to a sense of security, for any transition of power to be smooth. One may say, the slave masters deserved neither pride nor respect nor security; this is very true, but there was a very practical consideration, one that Daenerys acknowledged: the ultimate goal of conquest is to rule. An un-governable colony won\u2019t change for the better, because it won\u2019t remain a colony for long. In Meereen, as in many real-world colonies, colonisers were few and their constituents were many. Revolts would favour the latter, in particular, the former ruling class who often had both financial and geographical advantages. The Sons of Harpy\u2019s revolt did address that, albeit weakly.</p><p>No, I don\u2019t mean Daenerys should yield on the issue of slavery. Lives were at stake and the emancipation had to be immediate. But then, merely insisting this was the right thing to do and punishing offenders with increasing severity, while reinforcing the segregation between the ruling class and the ruled (Daenerys pretty much sequestered herself in the Great Pyramid), was not a direction to take to render the emancipation permanent. Daenerys had to be out there. She had to make serious effort to find common grounds in the 3-way between herself, the former slaves and former slave owners, especially after she\u2019d removed one of the pillars of Meereen\u2019s sociopolitical structure. It didn\u2019t matter that the latter were despicable; she had to find a connection. And being a nation that had stood thousands of years, with its wealth and fine architecture, Meereen had got to have something benign and beautiful that Queen Daenerys could embrace, that she could use as a bridge to endear her to her constituents and at the same time, de-emphasize the role of slavery in defining what Meereen was. Wear their clothes. Visit the temples. Whether she actually believed in their gods didn\u2019t matter. Join their festivities\u2014if she did it enough it would matter much less if she skipped the fighting pits. Go to their Flea\u2019s Bottom equivalent (as Margaery Tyrell did in King\u2019s Landing; she would\u2019ve made a good colonial governor). Talk to their craftsman and ask about their traditional crafts. Never for once did Daenerys consider these strategies. She could\u2019ve used Tyrion as her ambassador\u2014his stature and broken language skills, if utilized correctly, could loosen people\u2019s defense, and the parties he\u2019d attend would give him access to the good wines he craved and the setting for him to establish alliances with small talks. If governing foreign lands is indeed an art form, Daenerys didn\u2019t pursue it in Meereen, even though from her time with the Dothrakis, it seemed unlikely that she was ignorant of its necessity (She did eat a horse heart for her Khal and her unborn child).</p><p>Again, assuming that the writers were merely following GRRM\u2019s guideposts on her character arc, I had to contend with these possibilities that inform me about Daenerys the Ruler: 1) somewhere in her journey in Essos, she\u2019d lost her ability to empathize with the cultures under her rule. This seemed unlikely. Or, 2) she no longer felt the need to do it, her power no longer derived from a Khal.\u00a0Either way, with Westeros also being foreign to Daenerys, I started to wonder the kind of ruler she would end up being \u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u2026 and it looked rather similar to the Daenerys in her final scenes, asserting that her moral compass should make the entire Westeros bent their knees. I started to wonder if the show intended this to be a good or bad thing, or something more nuanced, as it should be. My hopes weren\u2019t high\u2014after all, our own western world still retains much of its colonial sensibilities, which would\u2019ve (rightly) praised Daenerys\u2019 role as a Liberator, but would also (sub)consciously downplay her \u2026 colonising tendencies.\u00a0</p><p>Does it mean I see Daenerys as a bad person, or going mad? Not at all. Conflating character and ability to rule is, IMO, one of the major weaknesses of her ending (more on that later); it was also, perhaps ironically, Daenerys\u2019 own fatal mistake. My question is merely one about her fitness to rule, which is itself a fluid thing. War-time rulers require different skills compared to peace-time rulers, conquerors to defenders. The serious contenders of the Iron Throne each had their own strengths, some better suited for rulership and some better for rulership at different times. Stannis was a strong general but was too easily swayed as a ruler. Daenerys was a conqueror. Jon Snow was a diplomat.\u00a0</p><p>One thing, however, is true and consistent in the world of GoT: to gain power, being morally righteous is not enough. Ned Stark\u2019s detached head brought this point across all too well. Rulers win the hearts of their people. Not the brains, not the logic that decides what is right or wrong. Humans are inherently passionate about power, whether it\u2019s theirs to own or not.</p><p>And this is, perhaps, Daenerys Stormborn\u2019s greatest tragedy. She assumed her strict moral compass, along with her birthright and strong will, would be sufficient to take her to the Iron Throne. Her dragons further misguided her in that regard\u2014punishments by Dracarys lent an extra mythical weight and poetry to her judgments, as if she had a higher power, like God, on her side. When she asked Jon Snow if she was to rule with love or fear, she asked as if the two were a dichotomy, seemingly blind to the fact that she had always treaded the line between the two. Love got her the Unsullied, the talents who came far and wide to advise her; fear got her the Dothrakis, the fragile peace in Essos.\u00a0</p><p>If you\u2019ve read till here (thank you), you may assume I\u2019d defend Daenerys\u2019 decision to burn King\u2019s Landing, or suggest it was foreshadowed. I\u2019d say this: I find it to be within the realms of possibility, but only given my personal opinion about her rule in Meereen. I don\u2019t see it as a botched coin-flip by the Gods, because nothing in her prior judgment suggested madness. Yes, she\u2019d ignored advice before, but no more than, say, Robert Baratheon or Joffrey (Cersei simply killed those who gave her advice she didn\u2019t like). Daenerys\u2019 decision to march to King\u2019s Landing immediately after the Battle of Winterfell\u2014the last major decision she made before the sacking\u2014might not be wise to some but was logically sound. I\u2019d also venture to say this, perhaps in defence of the show\u2019s writers: I\u2019m also not quite sure if the show intended her decision to be a proof of madness.\u00a0</p><p>Because I\u2019m not sure if the madness told in this show was real at all.\u00a0</p><p>Because curiously, while the coin flip had been mentioned several times, the show never offered us any concrete, visual evidence that Daenerys had suffered a loss of reason, which defines madness for us who live on Earth in the 21st century. The destruction of King\u2019s Landing was portrayed at the ground level; we didn\u2019t exactly see Daenerys cackling, or enjoying the carnage. Making a terrible decision does not a mad person make. She was seen to be sure of herself in her final scene with Jon Snow\u2014but why shouldn\u2019t she be, when she\u2019d just emerged victorious and achieved her life\u2019s goal, her revenge? If cockiness had been the mark of madness, half of the characters in the show would\u2019ve been mad.\u00a0</p><p>Even more curious to me is this: people like Ramsey or Joffrey or Cersei, who\u2019d done seriously mad things in our perspective, were never once described as \u201cmad\u201d. The adjective \u201cMad\u201d had always been reserved for the Mad King.\u00a0</p><p>How was the Mad King mad then? This is important, because Daenerys supposedly inherited his madness. But the audience hadn\u2019t been given much information. We know The Mad King killed his dissidents, but that seemed to fall within standard monarch behaviour. We know he and his advisors\u2014including, notably, Varys\u2014were at increasing odds with each other, but put a bunch of power-hungry men with immense power imbalance in the same room and that would happen more likely than not. He killed Ned Stark\u2019s father and brother in a confrontation\u2014so he was vengeful, distrustful, and brutal, yes, just like Joffrey or Cersei, but still, nothing that spoke particularly of madness. He was said to want King\u2019s Landing destroyed, but the act was never realized; we only learned of his intentions via Jaimie. He set up the network of wildfires, which were terrible weapons but also \u2026 traditional in the Targaryen dynasty, if wildfires had indeed been invented as replacements of Dracarys. So how mad was actually the Mad King then, compared to his ancestors? Or was he called Mad only because he lost his game of thrones, and history was written by victors? When Varys claimed to be worried about Daenerys\u2019 state\u2014when he hinted at her madness and being a bad coin flip\u2014was he merely repeating the same lies that had been told about her father, with the purpose of setting up a chain reaction that would propel Jon Snow to the Iron Throne, as the same lies had helped justify and cement Robert Baratheon\u2019s reign? Varys might have been trying to feed Daenerys something. A \u201ccrazy potion\u201d, maybe? \u00a0</p><p>Yes, I know. I\u2019m probably reading too much into this. It\u2019s my wishful thinking, perhaps, to not see Daenerys as mad (or the writers writing her as mad) because that would\u2019ve taken away her agency. Because Daenerys\u2019 character arc doesn\u2019t deserve an ending equivalent to death by a falling flowerpot. Because, if her sacking of King\u2019s Landing was meant to be the Shock of Season 8, she must retain her agency. It\u2019s shocking because a good person did it. A good person is good only when she has the agency to make terrible mistakes.</p><p>So how am I reading Daenerys\u2019 decision to sack King\u2019s Landing? If I were to ignore all inputs outside the show\u2014I don\u2019t know if the showrunners had commented on anything\u2014this is how I would \u201cbridge the gap\u201d, so to speak; how I\u2019d imagine the thoughts running through Daenery\u2019s mind as the bells rang, behind the few seconds the camera focused on Emilia Clark\u2019s face in the show. I believe the series of tragedies Daenerys had suffered (losing Jorah, Missandei, a dragon son) had only made her more determined to wipe out, as Greyworm told Jon, everyone who\u2019d served Cersei. But while this sounded like a simple task, carrying it out was much more complicated. Cersei\u2019s armies were dispersed all over the city; they could easily remove their armour and feign innocence. Moreover, every resident in King\u2019s Landing could be seen as an accomplice to Cersei\u2019s reign; even the people in Flea\u2019s Bottom, like Gendry, used to make weapons for the Lannisters. Were they to be wiped out as well? If not, where to draw the line? This order nonetheless confirmed Daenerys\u2019 world view that the morally corrupt should perish without mercy, and Cersei was, indeed, corruption defined. Daenerys had seen Cersei\u2019s treachery herself, and the sheer scale of it must be as foreign to her as Westeros itself. Her closest friends and followers, Greyworm and Missandei, didn\u2019t even know how to tell a joke\u2014the smallest, most benign form of treachery. Daenerys knew what treachery was, of course, she\u2019d suffered greatly from it, but treachery in the game of thrones was a different beast and she wasn\u2019t yet equipped to handle it, to make correct assessments of the kind of behaviours it\u2019d instigate\u2014unlike Cersei and Tyrion, who as Lannisters had been breathing it in since birth, or Varys, who\u2019d been both an observer of multiple reigns and a ruthless Kingmaker himself. King\u2019s Landing, the city itself, had also signified little but treachery to Daenerys\u2014her father had been murdered there by someone who\u2019d sworn to protect him; men had been sent from there to murder her since she\u2019d been born.\u00a0</p><p>While Tyrion had told said that Cersei\u2019s armies were serving only out of fear, Daenerys, who\u2019d only had the most faithful / honest armies, the Unsullies and Dothrakis, probably couldn\u2019t truly appreciate what that meant. She had every cause to be terrified then when the bells rang, especially when they rang so early, without her or her army and allies even close to the Red Keep. Ironically, perhaps, her own moral righteousness became her blind spot; she might have assumed Cersei\u2019s forces had something far more sinister waiting for her\u2014because how could they abandon their duties, their queen so easily?</p><p>And if they did abandon their duties and their queen so easily, what would stop them from committing the same treachery when Daenerys becomes queen herself? How could she vet the innocent and the treacherous and if she couldn\u2019t\u2014and she couldn\u2019t, not with one dragon, a small army and no geographical advantage\u2014what could she do? What could she do, when she was Daenerys Stormborn, who would never compromise to treachery?</p><p>I can see her feeling cornered. I can see her feeling she was left with one option: take the innocents out with the treachery. Do it like removing a tumour. Cut out a ring of good flesh around the bad.\u00a0</p><p>The ring of good flesh was King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Plausible? Maybe? That tragically, both the rise and fall of Daenerys Targaryen could be attributed to her moral code? That she didn\u2019t lose this game of thrones because she was evil, but because war and politics have always been amoral and she was a misfit? People in Westeros change allegiance all the time; morals are fluid and carry a price tag. Appropriately then, the man who understood and lived by these rules, whose loyalty could always be bought\u2014Bronn\u2014was also the biggest winner of this game of thrones.</p><p>I\u2019d say this though:\u00a0 a plot point as significant, and as close to the finale as the sacking of King\u2019s Landing, shouldn\u2019t require the audience twisting their minds into pretzels to make it feel plausible, and my brain feels a bit pretzly at a moment. No matter what the writers intended, there remained too many holes for the watchers to fill with their imagination. I\u2019ve read some who said the final season was too rushed; I\u2019m not sure that was the issue. The issue, I think, is that even if given enough screen time, the writers didn\u2019t quite know how to drive the characters without the books\u2019 guidance\u2014an issue that had become apparent by Season 6. The last three seasons felt\u2026derivative, like fanfics of the first four. This isn\u2019t a slight (well, not a big one)\u2014Benioff and Weiss had managed what GRRM hasn\u2019t been able to\u2014but I felt a sense that their visions of the world had evolved to conflict with GRRM\u2019s over the course of the show. Meanwhile, they still<i> needed </i>to hit the goal posts GRRM provided, while they <i>wanted</i> to focus on / believe in something else. The result was the later seasons that felt \u2026schizophrenic at times. GoT had highly implausible moments since Season 1, but the first four seasons sold them because the showrunners believed in them. S8 Ep5&amp;6, meanwhile, offered enough for me to logically agree that the sacking of King\u2019s Landing and Daenerys\u2019 downfall can be canon, but not enough for me to believe emotionally because\u2026I didn\u2019t feel the showrunners believed in them. The events felt written to serve a purpose other than storytelling\u2014maybe to match GRRM\u2019s notes, or satisfy the perceived need to shock; in all cases, I felt the hearts of the writers were somewhere else, somewhere perhaps more spectacular than dissecting the motivations of a fallen queen. The shift towards visual storytelling in the later seasons, perhaps to mitigate the difficulty of writing dialogues for an ensemble of deeply complex and intertwined characters, furthered exposed the incoherence of the show\u2019s focus. While I love the visuals, GoT had its origins as a political show and politics is 99% talk. Similarly, the increased reliance on the actors to convey their characters via facial expressions and body language might work for someone like Brienne, who was taciturn and largely consistent personality wise, but insufficient for characters who used talking as a weapon (Tyrion) or underwent major transformations (Daenerys).\u00a0</p><p>Anyway, back to Dany. If there was one thing I truly, truly dislike about the close of her story arc, it was the very end, when Jon Snow drove that dagger into her. Painfully cliche aside (I\u2019ll leave Cersei\u2019s baby to another day), it also unfairly cemented Daenery\u2019s highly un-rightful place as the villain of the story, given that Jon Snow, the uncontested Good Human of the show, committed the murder. The show pitted two sympathetic characters against each other just to let one \u2026 leech the sympathy out of the other, when neither of their characters deserved the treatment (yes, I found this decision to be as unfair to Jon Snow as it was to Daenerys). As much as I had reservations about Daenery\u2019s ability to govern, I never doubted the heart that Jon stabbed, the desire in it to do good for the people. Yes, I said it isn\u2019t enough, and yes, I believe that too inflexible a moral code forcibly imposed upon others can do great damage, but this is very different from saying that Daenerys Stormborn was a villain. Conflating character and ability is human, but I expected this show to know enough nuance to avoid this mistake. Having the heart, the desire to rule well, is a start. A great and important start. A start seen in few others in the whole series. The early seasons of GoT were particularly strong in depicting characters in the grey but Daenerys, sadly, was robbed of that; she swung violently from white to black.</p><p>And what was so disappointing is that it needn\u2019t be that way. Daenerys could have caused the destruction to King\u2019s Landing and still be sympathetic. Queen Cersei was still in the Red Keep, and the Wildfires buried by the Mad King remained all over the city. Innocents die in wars, there\u2019s never an exception to that, even if the wars are waged with the best intentions. I\u2019m no show writer, but this is what I could come up with to spare Daenery\u2019s fate as a villain after a few walking trips around my city, while keeping most major plot points intact. Show writers can do (much) better.\u00a0</p><p>Just for the fun of it, below is the alternative ending for Daenerys I came up with, and I will end my very, very long thesis here :) . Thank you so, so much for reading! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f</p><p>===</p><p>1) Start of the episode. Qyburn teaching his little birds a nursery rhyme about a Mad King and his Wildfires, and an Evil Queen who will set them all burning. He tells them to sing far and wide. (This is just an excuse to get another song from Ramin Djawadi)</p><p>2) Long shots of combustibles being laid in the same tunnels Lancel Lannister crawled through back in Season 6 Ep 10, before the explosion of the Sept of Baelor. That 10-minute sequence was so classic that the audience would likely remember the place. Piles of wood connect the stores of barrels that we know contain the Wildfires. Black tar flows down the sewers of the Red Keep, down the alleys in Flea Bottom, slicking everything, staining the innocents there with (Queen Cersei\u2019s) muck. This sequence can be done entirely through visuals.</p><p>3) The Bell rings. Daenerys attacks the Red Keep with Dracarys. The tar and wood catch fire and carry the flames to the Wildfires around the city. As Wildfire is Dracarys\u2019 substitute, the two augments each other and the city soon turns into an Inferno. Daenerys watches, horrified and unable to do a thing. The nursery rhyme becomes a prophecy: as much as a Lannister laid the grounds, the Targaryens are solely responsible for the King\u2019s Landing destruction. Woods and tar are, after all, harmless without fire. And Daenerys Stormborn, who swore to protect and liberate the weak, ends up killing more innocents than Cersei ever had.\u00a0</p><p>4) Tyrion advises Daenerys that for now, she has no choice but to rule by fear. A reign cannot start with apologies, and what good will it do? So Daenerys gives the same speech to her armies on the steps of the ruined Red Keep, but noticeably distraught.</p><p>5) Daenerys must also restrain Drogon. She can\u2019t afford him accidentally setting more fires in the city, while her armies scour every tunnel to make sure all Wildfires have been consumed. So the Breaker of Chains is forced to chain down her son, the symbol of her power.</p><p>6) Drogon, being intelligent but still a beast, maims Daenerys badly in his struggle to be free. Jon finds Daenerys, but she\u2019s beyond saving. She tells Jon to keep what he saw secret, and if he can\u2019t\u2014she knows he can\u2019t\u2014to please lie for her, for once, that Drogon did it to avenge for the innocents she killed; that Drogon, and their family name he represents, knows justice above the fire and blood. When honest Jon reacts\u2026honestly, she asks him to ask Tyrion for advice. She struggles to stand, says she wants to try the Iron Throne before she goes. She refuses Jon\u2019s help; she walks, head high, blood trailing like a cape behind her, as she crosses the ruins. She won\u2019t make it. Only her finger will get to touch the Iron Throne, as in her prophecy in the House of the Undying. Jon kneels behind her as she falls on her own knees. She will always be his queen. Drogon carries her away.</p><p>7) The waiting period can be a mourning period for all who have perished. Tyrion will still recommend Bran to be their King, as his proposal will be accepted as he remains the Hand. Jon would\u2019ve asked Tyrion about the lying, and the issue can be brought up when \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d is presented in the small council. King Bran can then offer his wisdom as the Three-Eyed Raven, the Living History. What does he think, when he sees both the truth in history and the lies and prophecies told about it, that propel it? Does he approve of them? Disapprove? This will also wrap up the theme of the show, about the stories that make history, the history that makes us. Ser Davos can ask about the legend of Azor Ahai that cost Stannis Baratheon everything. Is it true? Does it matter? Also, how many swords actually make up the Iron Throne? Thousands, as the legends and Daenarys had believed? No more than two hundred, as Little Finger said in Season One? How many more swords have been buried for these thousands or hundreds?</p>",
                "content": "<p>Here&rsquo;s my first review post on Game of Thrones! Thank you so much for asking about Daenerys, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcnzBwaPrc2gQ2VMN48k0SQ\">@bixgirl1</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFQpd1kJ8RIOLfUXWO_-CWQ\">@kikibluemay</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1z2RaI-2RUZEKgc2mEB2iA\">@oceaxe-ifdawn</a>. She was fascinating and tragic, and I couldn&rsquo;t really stop talking about her&hellip; as in, I ended up writing a 4k+ word essay on her character.</p><p>Due to the length, I&rsquo;ve crossed-posted to AO3 for those who prefer to read it there:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19119595\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/19119595</a>&nbsp;. As usual, never feel obliged to do anything! Fandom is a happy, carefree place for me :) .</p><p>Before I start, I&rsquo;d like to say this&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never expected GoT to be progressive. Its medieval aesthetics aside, the gratuitous violence and nudity really seal the deal. Therefore, this review is written decidedly without a social justice lens; I shall not argue if the showrunners were feminists, racists, imperialists etc. Also, I haven&rsquo;t read the books and have read few metas and reviews; so these are my unfiltered thoughts and of course, my personal opinion. I got interested in Game of Thrones because the snippets I knew of it reminded me of ancient Chinese history, which I loved for its twists, its very blurred lines between truths and myths, its cynical record of human nature, clever strategies and bloodshed. Along this vein, I was, and still am, the most interested in how each contender of the Iron Throne got there, and as the theme of the story emerged (&ldquo;the lies we spin, our fates they weave&rdquo; is my way of describing it), the things they told for motivation&mdash;the lies and truths that, should they win, would become history.</p><p>Of all the contenders and their stories, Daenerys&rsquo; rise was the most&hellip;mythical and uplifting. She was easy to root for, partly because we&rsquo;re conditioned to root for heroes like her. The last descendant of a dynasty. Orphan. Exiled, abused, went through her personal journey from little better than a slave to become queen. She even birthed dragons and rode them to war. I really enjoyed the part of her story as the Khaleesi. She grew into a queen in every way, and an ideal one, by the time led her small group of followers across the desert. I loved her&mdash;she was strong, resilient, intelligent, righteous. And she understood and respected a culture that was supposedly far below her (as her brother Viserys frequently reminded everyone).&nbsp;</p><p>But then came Astapor, then Yunkai, then Meereen. She became a true ruler, without a Khal by her side&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>I started feeling a little uncomfortable. I was puzzled by that. Her cause was emancipation, one I believe was absolutely correct. Her stance was uncompromising. She walked the walk. Every single one of these traits was beyond admirable, and precious among rulers. Nailing 163 slave masters for 163 children might seem brutal, but the world of GoT *was* brutal.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, something felt&hellip;off.</p><p>Then I realized: after all the screen time in Meereen, I remained very much ignorant of the place, other than it practiced slavery. Slavery&mdash;and the barbaric practices surrounding it, such as the fighting pits&mdash;was presented as the only thing that defined her new constituents in her eyes. This could be by design, to show Daenerys&rsquo; &ldquo;style&rdquo; as a ruler. This can also be a reflection of the showrunners&rsquo; perspectives, their disquiet about tackling slavery for a larger audience.&nbsp; But if I must judge the show by its own merits and ignore the hands behind it, the repeated shots of Daenerys sitting high in the Great Pyramid, she and her advisors donned in their foreign attire, telling the locals who looked nothing like them, over and over again, that they were wrong&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>She looked like a coloniser. My radars were beeping for that reason. I grew up in a colony, a well cared for one (ie, it would&rsquo;ve fared far worse if it hadn&rsquo;t been colonised). Colonialism is therefore an integral part of my life, and my views of it are coloured and educated by the experience. Controversial point:  far from a general rule, but I recognise that colonizers can do great good. I&rsquo;m a beneficiary of that myself. However, I&rsquo;ve also learned that there&rsquo;s an art to bringing these great goods to the colonised. One lesson: defining these people, especially when they&rsquo;re foreign to the ruler, with anything that the ruler is seeking to eradicate &mdash; a habit, a tradition, a set of beliefs&hellip; &mdash;is not a recipe for success. It&rsquo;s a matter of human pride&mdash;the pride of, in this case, the people who&rsquo;d just suffered defeat. The former ruling class needs to feel some respect, which translates to a sense of security, for any transition of power to be smooth. One may say, the slave masters deserved neither pride nor respect nor security; this is very true, but there was a very practical consideration, one that Daenerys acknowledged: the ultimate goal of conquest is to rule. An un-governable colony won&rsquo;t change for the better, because it won&rsquo;t remain a colony for long. In Meereen, as in many real-world colonies, colonisers were few and their constituents were many. Revolts would favour the latter, in particular, the former ruling class who often had both financial and geographical advantages. The Sons of Harpy&rsquo;s revolt did address that, albeit weakly.</p><p>No, I don&rsquo;t mean Daenerys should yield on the issue of slavery. Lives were at stake and the emancipation had to be immediate. But then, merely insisting this was the right thing to do and punishing offenders with increasing severity, while reinforcing the segregation between the ruling class and the ruled (Daenerys pretty much sequestered herself in the Great Pyramid), was not a direction to take to render the emancipation permanent. Daenerys had to be out there. She had to make serious effort to find common grounds in the 3-way between herself, the former slaves and former slave owners, especially after she&rsquo;d removed one of the pillars of Meereen&rsquo;s sociopolitical structure. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the latter were despicable; she had to find a connection. And being a nation that had stood thousands of years, with its wealth and fine architecture, Meereen had got to have something benign and beautiful that Queen Daenerys could embrace, that she could use as a bridge to endear her to her constituents and at the same time, de-emphasize the role of slavery in defining what Meereen was. Wear their clothes. Visit the temples. Whether she actually believed in their gods didn&rsquo;t matter. Join their festivities&mdash;if she did it enough it would matter much less if she skipped the fighting pits. Go to their Flea&rsquo;s Bottom equivalent (as Margaery Tyrell did in King&rsquo;s Landing; she would&rsquo;ve made a good colonial governor). Talk to their craftsman and ask about their traditional crafts. Never for once did Daenerys consider these strategies. She could&rsquo;ve used Tyrion as her ambassador&mdash;his stature and broken language skills, if utilized correctly, could loosen people&rsquo;s defense, and the parties he&rsquo;d attend would give him access to the good wines he craved and the setting for him to establish alliances with small talks. If governing foreign lands is indeed an art form, Daenerys didn&rsquo;t pursue it in Meereen, even though from her time with the Dothrakis, it seemed unlikely that she was ignorant of its necessity (She did eat a horse heart for her Khal and her unborn child).</p><p>Again, assuming that the writers were merely following GRRM&rsquo;s guideposts on her character arc, I had to contend with these possibilities that inform me about Daenerys the Ruler: 1) somewhere in her journey in Essos, she&rsquo;d lost her ability to empathize with the cultures under her rule. This seemed unlikely. Or, 2) she no longer felt the need to do it, her power no longer derived from a Khal.&nbsp;Either way, with Westeros also being foreign to Daenerys, I started to wonder the kind of ruler she would end up being &hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>&hellip; and it looked rather similar to the Daenerys in her final scenes, asserting that her moral compass should make the entire Westeros bent their knees. I started to wonder if the show intended this to be a good or bad thing, or something more nuanced, as it should be. My hopes weren&rsquo;t high&mdash;after all, our own western world still retains much of its colonial sensibilities, which would&rsquo;ve (rightly) praised Daenerys&rsquo; role as a Liberator, but would also (sub)consciously downplay her &hellip; colonising tendencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Does it mean I see Daenerys as a bad person, or going mad? Not at all. Conflating character and ability to rule is, IMO, one of the major weaknesses of her ending (more on that later); it was also, perhaps ironically, Daenerys&rsquo; own fatal mistake. My question is merely one about her fitness to rule, which is itself a fluid thing. War-time rulers require different skills compared to peace-time rulers, conquerors to defenders. The serious contenders of the Iron Throne each had their own strengths, some better suited for rulership and some better for rulership at different times. Stannis was a strong general but was too easily swayed as a ruler. Daenerys was a conqueror. Jon Snow was a diplomat.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing, however, is true and consistent in the world of GoT: to gain power, being morally righteous is not enough. Ned Stark&rsquo;s detached head brought this point across all too well. Rulers win the hearts of their people. Not the brains, not the logic that decides what is right or wrong. Humans are inherently passionate about power, whether it&rsquo;s theirs to own or not.</p><p>And this is, perhaps, Daenerys Stormborn&rsquo;s greatest tragedy. She assumed her strict moral compass, along with her birthright and strong will, would be sufficient to take her to the Iron Throne. Her dragons further misguided her in that regard&mdash;punishments by Dracarys lent an extra mythical weight and poetry to her judgments, as if she had a higher power, like God, on her side. When she asked Jon Snow if she was to rule with love or fear, she asked as if the two were a dichotomy, seemingly blind to the fact that she had always treaded the line between the two. Love got her the Unsullied, the talents who came far and wide to advise her; fear got her the Dothrakis, the fragile peace in Essos.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve read till here (thank you), you may assume I&rsquo;d defend Daenerys&rsquo; decision to burn King&rsquo;s Landing, or suggest it was foreshadowed. I&rsquo;d say this: I find it to be within the realms of possibility, but only given my personal opinion about her rule in Meereen. I don&rsquo;t see it as a botched coin-flip by the Gods, because nothing in her prior judgment suggested madness. Yes, she&rsquo;d ignored advice before, but no more than, say, Robert Baratheon or Joffrey (Cersei simply killed those who gave her advice she didn&rsquo;t like). Daenerys&rsquo; decision to march to King&rsquo;s Landing immediately after the Battle of Winterfell&mdash;the last major decision she made before the sacking&mdash;might not be wise to some but was logically sound. I&rsquo;d also venture to say this, perhaps in defence of the show&rsquo;s writers: I&rsquo;m also not quite sure if the show intended her decision to be a proof of madness.&nbsp;</p><p>Because I&rsquo;m not sure if the madness told in this show was real at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Because curiously, while the coin flip had been mentioned several times, the show never offered us any concrete, visual evidence that Daenerys had suffered a loss of reason, which defines madness for us who live on Earth in the 21st century. The destruction of King&rsquo;s Landing was portrayed at the ground level; we didn&rsquo;t exactly see Daenerys cackling, or enjoying the carnage. Making a terrible decision does not a mad person make. She was seen to be sure of herself in her final scene with Jon Snow&mdash;but why shouldn&rsquo;t she be, when she&rsquo;d just emerged victorious and achieved her life&rsquo;s goal, her revenge? If cockiness had been the mark of madness, half of the characters in the show would&rsquo;ve been mad.&nbsp;</p><p>Even more curious to me is this: people like Ramsey or Joffrey or Cersei, who&rsquo;d done seriously mad things in our perspective, were never once described as &ldquo;mad&rdquo;. The adjective &ldquo;Mad&rdquo; had always been reserved for the Mad King.&nbsp;</p><p>How was the Mad King mad then? This is important, because Daenerys supposedly inherited his madness. But the audience hadn&rsquo;t been given much information. We know The Mad King killed his dissidents, but that seemed to fall within standard monarch behaviour. We know he and his advisors&mdash;including, notably, Varys&mdash;were at increasing odds with each other, but put a bunch of power-hungry men with immense power imbalance in the same room and that would happen more likely than not. He killed Ned Stark&rsquo;s father and brother in a confrontation&mdash;so he was vengeful, distrustful, and brutal, yes, just like Joffrey or Cersei, but still, nothing that spoke particularly of madness. He was said to want King&rsquo;s Landing destroyed, but the act was never realized; we only learned of his intentions via Jaimie. He set up the network of wildfires, which were terrible weapons but also &hellip; traditional in the Targaryen dynasty, if wildfires had indeed been invented as replacements of Dracarys. So how mad was actually the Mad King then, compared to his ancestors? Or was he called Mad only because he lost his game of thrones, and history was written by victors? When Varys claimed to be worried about Daenerys&rsquo; state&mdash;when he hinted at her madness and being a bad coin flip&mdash;was he merely repeating the same lies that had been told about her father, with the purpose of setting up a chain reaction that would propel Jon Snow to the Iron Throne, as the same lies had helped justify and cement Robert Baratheon&rsquo;s reign? Varys might have been trying to feed Daenerys something. A &ldquo;crazy potion&rdquo;, maybe? &nbsp;</p><p>Yes, I know. I&rsquo;m probably reading too much into this. It&rsquo;s my wishful thinking, perhaps, to not see Daenerys as mad (or the writers writing her as mad) because that would&rsquo;ve taken away her agency. Because Daenerys&rsquo; character arc doesn&rsquo;t deserve an ending equivalent to death by a falling flowerpot. Because, if her sacking of King&rsquo;s Landing was meant to be the Shock of Season 8, she must retain her agency. It&rsquo;s shocking because a good person did it. A good person is good only when she has the agency to make terrible mistakes.</p><p>So how am I reading Daenerys&rsquo; decision to sack King&rsquo;s Landing? If I were to ignore all inputs outside the show&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if the showrunners had commented on anything&mdash;this is how I would &ldquo;bridge the gap&rdquo;, so to speak; how I&rsquo;d imagine the thoughts running through Daenery&rsquo;s mind as the bells rang, behind the few seconds the camera focused on Emilia Clark&rsquo;s face in the show. I believe the series of tragedies Daenerys had suffered (losing Jorah, Missandei, a dragon son) had only made her more determined to wipe out, as Greyworm told Jon, everyone who&rsquo;d served Cersei. But while this sounded like a simple task, carrying it out was much more complicated. Cersei&rsquo;s armies were dispersed all over the city; they could easily remove their armour and feign innocence. Moreover, every resident in King&rsquo;s Landing could be seen as an accomplice to Cersei&rsquo;s reign; even the people in Flea&rsquo;s Bottom, like Gendry, used to make weapons for the Lannisters. Were they to be wiped out as well? If not, where to draw the line? This order nonetheless confirmed Daenerys&rsquo; world view that the morally corrupt should perish without mercy, and Cersei was, indeed, corruption defined. Daenerys had seen Cersei&rsquo;s treachery herself, and the sheer scale of it must be as foreign to her as Westeros itself. Her closest friends and followers, Greyworm and Missandei, didn&rsquo;t even know how to tell a joke&mdash;the smallest, most benign form of treachery. Daenerys knew what treachery was, of course, she&rsquo;d suffered greatly from it, but treachery in the game of thrones was a different beast and she wasn&rsquo;t yet equipped to handle it, to make correct assessments of the kind of behaviours it&rsquo;d instigate&mdash;unlike Cersei and Tyrion, who as Lannisters had been breathing it in since birth, or Varys, who&rsquo;d been both an observer of multiple reigns and a ruthless Kingmaker himself. King&rsquo;s Landing, the city itself, had also signified little but treachery to Daenerys&mdash;her father had been murdered there by someone who&rsquo;d sworn to protect him; men had been sent from there to murder her since she&rsquo;d been born.&nbsp;</p><p>While Tyrion had told said that Cersei&rsquo;s armies were serving only out of fear, Daenerys, who&rsquo;d only had the most faithful / honest armies, the Unsullies and Dothrakis, probably couldn&rsquo;t truly appreciate what that meant. She had every cause to be terrified then when the bells rang, especially when they rang so early, without her or her army and allies even close to the Red Keep. Ironically, perhaps, her own moral righteousness became her blind spot; she might have assumed Cersei&rsquo;s forces had something far more sinister waiting for her&mdash;because how could they abandon their duties, their queen so easily?</p><p>And if they did abandon their duties and their queen so easily, what would stop them from committing the same treachery when Daenerys becomes queen herself? How could she vet the innocent and the treacherous and if she couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and she couldn&rsquo;t, not with one dragon, a small army and no geographical advantage&mdash;what could she do? What could she do, when she was Daenerys Stormborn, who would never compromise to treachery?</p><p>I can see her feeling cornered. I can see her feeling she was left with one option: take the innocents out with the treachery. Do it like removing a tumour. Cut out a ring of good flesh around the bad.&nbsp;</p><p>The ring of good flesh was King&rsquo;s Landing.</p><p>Plausible? Maybe? That tragically, both the rise and fall of Daenerys Targaryen could be attributed to her moral code? That she didn&rsquo;t lose this game of thrones because she was evil, but because war and politics have always been amoral and she was a misfit? People in Westeros change allegiance all the time; morals are fluid and carry a price tag. Appropriately then, the man who understood and lived by these rules, whose loyalty could always be bought&mdash;Bronn&mdash;was also the biggest winner of this game of thrones.</p><p>I&rsquo;d say this though:&nbsp; a plot point as significant, and as close to the finale as the sacking of King&rsquo;s Landing, shouldn&rsquo;t require the audience twisting their minds into pretzels to make it feel plausible, and my brain feels a bit pretzly at a moment. No matter what the writers intended, there remained too many holes for the watchers to fill with their imagination. I&rsquo;ve read some who said the final season was too rushed; I&rsquo;m not sure that was the issue. The issue, I think, is that even if given enough screen time, the writers didn&rsquo;t quite know how to drive the characters without the books&rsquo; guidance&mdash;an issue that had become apparent by Season 6. The last three seasons felt&hellip;derivative, like fanfics of the first four. This isn&rsquo;t a slight (well, not a big one)&mdash;Benioff and Weiss had managed what GRRM hasn&rsquo;t been able to&mdash;but I felt a sense that their visions of the world had evolved to conflict with GRRM&rsquo;s over the course of the show. Meanwhile, they still<i> needed </i>to hit the goal posts GRRM provided, while they <i>wanted</i> to focus on / believe in something else. The result was the later seasons that felt &hellip;schizophrenic at times. GoT had highly implausible moments since Season 1, but the first four seasons sold them because the showrunners believed in them. S8 Ep5&amp;6, meanwhile, offered enough for me to logically agree that the sacking of King&rsquo;s Landing and Daenerys&rsquo; downfall can be canon, but not enough for me to believe emotionally because&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t feel the showrunners believed in them. The events felt written to serve a purpose other than storytelling&mdash;maybe to match GRRM&rsquo;s notes, or satisfy the perceived need to shock; in all cases, I felt the hearts of the writers were somewhere else, somewhere perhaps more spectacular than dissecting the motivations of a fallen queen. The shift towards visual storytelling in the later seasons, perhaps to mitigate the difficulty of writing dialogues for an ensemble of deeply complex and intertwined characters, furthered exposed the incoherence of the show&rsquo;s focus. While I love the visuals, GoT had its origins as a political show and politics is 99% talk. Similarly, the increased reliance on the actors to convey their characters via facial expressions and body language might work for someone like Brienne, who was taciturn and largely consistent personality wise, but insufficient for characters who used talking as a weapon (Tyrion) or underwent major transformations (Daenerys).&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, back to Dany. If there was one thing I truly, truly dislike about the close of her story arc, it was the very end, when Jon Snow drove that dagger into her. Painfully cliche aside (I&rsquo;ll leave Cersei&rsquo;s baby to another day), it also unfairly cemented Daenery&rsquo;s highly un-rightful place as the villain of the story, given that Jon Snow, the uncontested Good Human of the show, committed the murder. The show pitted two sympathetic characters against each other just to let one &hellip; leech the sympathy out of the other, when neither of their characters deserved the treatment (yes, I found this decision to be as unfair to Jon Snow as it was to Daenerys). As much as I had reservations about Daenery&rsquo;s ability to govern, I never doubted the heart that Jon stabbed, the desire in it to do good for the people. Yes, I said it isn&rsquo;t enough, and yes, I believe that too inflexible a moral code forcibly imposed upon others can do great damage, but this is very different from saying that Daenerys Stormborn was a villain. Conflating character and ability is human, but I expected this show to know enough nuance to avoid this mistake. Having the heart, the desire to rule well, is a start. A great and important start. A start seen in few others in the whole series. The early seasons of GoT were particularly strong in depicting characters in the grey but Daenerys, sadly, was robbed of that; she swung violently from white to black.</p><p>And what was so disappointing is that it needn&rsquo;t be that way. Daenerys could have caused the destruction to King&rsquo;s Landing and still be sympathetic. Queen Cersei was still in the Red Keep, and the Wildfires buried by the Mad King remained all over the city. Innocents die in wars, there&rsquo;s never an exception to that, even if the wars are waged with the best intentions. I&rsquo;m no show writer, but this is what I could come up with to spare Daenery&rsquo;s fate as a villain after a few walking trips around my city, while keeping most major plot points intact. Show writers can do (much) better.&nbsp;</p><p>Just for the fun of it, below is the alternative ending for Daenerys I came up with, and I will end my very, very long thesis here :) . Thank you so, so much for reading! &#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039;</p><p>===</p><p>1) Start of the episode. Qyburn teaching his little birds a nursery rhyme about a Mad King and his Wildfires, and an Evil Queen who will set them all burning. He tells them to sing far and wide. (This is just an excuse to get another song from Ramin Djawadi)</p><p>2) Long shots of combustibles being laid in the same tunnels Lancel Lannister crawled through back in Season 6 Ep 10, before the explosion of the Sept of Baelor. That 10-minute sequence was so classic that the audience would likely remember the place. Piles of wood connect the stores of barrels that we know contain the Wildfires. Black tar flows down the sewers of the Red Keep, down the alleys in Flea Bottom, slicking everything, staining the innocents there with (Queen Cersei&rsquo;s) muck. This sequence can be done entirely through visuals.</p><p>3) The Bell rings. Daenerys attacks the Red Keep with Dracarys. The tar and wood catch fire and carry the flames to the Wildfires around the city. As Wildfire is Dracarys&rsquo; substitute, the two augments each other and the city soon turns into an Inferno. Daenerys watches, horrified and unable to do a thing. The nursery rhyme becomes a prophecy: as much as a Lannister laid the grounds, the Targaryens are solely responsible for the King&rsquo;s Landing destruction. Woods and tar are, after all, harmless without fire. And Daenerys Stormborn, who swore to protect and liberate the weak, ends up killing more innocents than Cersei ever had.&nbsp;</p><p>4) Tyrion advises Daenerys that for now, she has no choice but to rule by fear. A reign cannot start with apologies, and what good will it do? So Daenerys gives the same speech to her armies on the steps of the ruined Red Keep, but noticeably distraught.</p><p>5) Daenerys must also restrain Drogon. She can&rsquo;t afford him accidentally setting more fires in the city, while her armies scour every tunnel to make sure all Wildfires have been consumed. So the Breaker of Chains is forced to chain down her son, the symbol of her power.</p><p>6) Drogon, being intelligent but still a beast, maims Daenerys badly in his struggle to be free. Jon finds Daenerys, but she&rsquo;s beyond saving. She tells Jon to keep what he saw secret, and if he can&rsquo;t&mdash;she knows he can&rsquo;t&mdash;to please lie for her, for once, that Drogon did it to avenge for the innocents she killed; that Drogon, and their family name he represents, knows justice above the fire and blood. When honest Jon reacts&hellip;honestly, she asks him to ask Tyrion for advice. She struggles to stand, says she wants to try the Iron Throne before she goes. She refuses Jon&rsquo;s help; she walks, head high, blood trailing like a cape behind her, as she crosses the ruins. She won&rsquo;t make it. Only her finger will get to touch the Iron Throne, as in her prophecy in the House of the Undying. Jon kneels behind her as she falls on her own knees. She will always be his queen. Drogon carries her away.</p><p>7) The waiting period can be a mourning period for all who have perished. Tyrion will still recommend Bran to be their King, as his proposal will be accepted as he remains the Hand. Jon would&rsquo;ve asked Tyrion about the lying, and the issue can be brought up when &ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire&rdquo; is presented in the small council. King Bran can then offer his wisdom as the Three-Eyed Raven, the Living History. What does he think, when he sees both the truth in history and the lies and prophecies told about it, that propel it? Does he approve of them? Disapprove? This will also wrap up the theme of the show, about the stories that make history, the history that makes us. Ser Davos can ask about the legend of Azor Ahai that cost Stannis Baratheon everything. Is it true? Does it matter? Also, how many swords actually make up the Iron Throne? Thousands, as the legends and Daenarys had believed? No more than two hundred, as Little Finger said in Season One? How many more swords have been buried for these thousands or hundreds?</p>",

His character took such a beating this season, that we could say he is useless without Dany after she\u2019s dead. And he seems more upset over killing his queen, than devestated that he MURDERED THE WOMAN HE LOVED. The only reason \u201cduty is the death of love\u201d in this case, is because that\u2019s how it was written. But I hate it. This is not who Jon is. He properly got over Ygritte. I don\u2019t know why an actual grieving period was skipped over in Dany\u2019s case. He goes beyond the wall with a smile on his face, like what he did is forgiven now.

She doesn\u2019t do this because she loves Jon; she does this to fuel discord with Daenerys. Sansa has been through quite a bit, I get that, but again, this is not the Sansa we know. She\u2019s loyal to Bran and Arya, but not to Jon or her FATHER, MAYBE? Who died to save you, Sansa? I\u2019m so mad how she was written this season, I can\u2019t even continue this bulletpoint. </p><p>4. In season 7, Arya leaves her \u201cduty\u201d to finish her list. And she goes back to her family. And then proceeds to leave them again to kill Cersei with the Hound. I don\u2019t think I have to explain to you why this is uneven to her narrative.

And even without knowing if any of them were alive, she retakes her identity of Arya Stark of Wintefell and leaves the Faceless Men. </p><h2>I look forward to the fandom continuing to band together as we reject this uneven narrative and characterization. </h2>",

She even says it in episode 2. </p><p>Everyone in the last season was out of character. You know this. It\u2019s been hammered into your head for weeks and weeks. In relation to the header, here are some examples:</p><p>1. Tyrion saying Jon should kill Daenerys is no where close to the character we know and love. Our Tyrion doesn\u2019t know anything about this: he killed his father and lover for emotional reasons, not because \u201che had to\u201d. You of all people should know the toll it takes on a person, TYRION. </p><p>2. Jon doesn\u2019t even really try to reason with her before he puts her down like a rabid dog. His character took such a beating this season, that we could say he is useless without Dany after she\u2019s dead. And he seems more upset over killing his queen, than devestated that he MURDERED THE WOMAN HE LOVED. The only reason \u201cduty is the death of love\u201d in this case, is because that\u2019s how it was written. But I hate it. This is not who Jon is. He properly got over Ygritte. I don\u2019t know why an actual grieving period was skipped over in Dany\u2019s case. He goes beyond the wall with a smile on his face, like what he did is forgiven now. That everything he did, doesn\u2019t weigh on him. WHERE IS JON SNOW???</p><p>3. Sansa betrays Jon by telling Tyrion about his true parentage. She doesn\u2019t do this because she loves Jon; she does this to fuel discord with Daenerys. Sansa has been through quite a bit, I get that, but again, this is not the Sansa we know. She\u2019s loyal to Bran and Arya, but not to Jon or her FATHER, MAYBE? Who died to save you, Sansa? I\u2019m so mad how she was written this season, I can\u2019t even continue this bulletpoint. </p><p>4. In season 7, Arya leaves her \u201cduty\u201d to finish her list. And she goes back to her family. And then proceeds to leave them again to kill Cersei with the Hound. I don\u2019t think I have to explain to you why this is uneven to her narrative. But I will anyway!!! Her entire list has been to avenge her family members\u2019 deaths. And even without knowing if any of them were alive, she retakes her identity of Arya Stark of Wintefell and leaves the Faceless Men. </p><h2>I look forward to the fandom continuing to band together as we reject this uneven narrative and characterization. </h2></p>",
