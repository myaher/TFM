Loki can pretend all he wants, he cannot watch his brother die, it\u2019s impossible. No matter how strong he wants to be and how much he wants to keep his marquerade alive, he can\u2019t do it.</p><p>The absolute relief when Thanos finally lets go of Thor\u2019s head is proof enough for that. His shoulders sink, he closes his eyes and sighs, his whole posture changes from \u201cOH GOD NO!\u201d to \u201cTHANK GOD\u201d.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc27f157b667aa2957b896dc2e43319d/tumblr_inline_pd4z63b7zd1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><p>There is, of course, the question as to why Loki would even try to trick Thanos when he should know better, but the following scene shows us exactly why. Thor believes the Tesseract was destroyed on Asgard and Loki did not want him to realize that it was not. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/65e1e5d9a0897b88bb457214d4d6657d/tumblr_inline_pd4z6a3h5X1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><p>There is so much shame and pain on Loki\u2019s face in this.

He looks down instead, with the shame we have seen on his face before, and only looks at Thanos when it\u2019s done, not at Thor. We can only imagine how much Thor\u2019s next words must have hurt him.</p><p>\u201cYou&hellip; you really are the worst, brother.\u201d (or alternatively, to make it even worse: \u201cYou really are the worst brother.\u201d)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8381526e524fbb41d5db08e47c8c0e14/tumblr_inline_pd4z77cppN1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><p>And still, Loki has some of his confidence left when he says: \u201cI assure you, brother, the sun <i>will </i>shine on us again.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a2227d543bfd66263e1378635d64bbd4/tumblr_inline_pd4z7pv7mT1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f715b886ee1ff8a27e3eb8f57b1f5c86/tumblr_inline_pd4z7rDwjv1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><p>This confidence shows when Thanos calls Loki \u2018Asgardian\u2019, where we see Loki reject this word completely and not without a hint of pride on his face and in his voice. He brings the Tesseract out of Thanos\u2019 reach, saying: \u201cWell, for onc thing: I\u2019m <i>not </i>Asgardian.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c10b10a68d92983b14cbac739ad1c96e/tumblr_inline_pd4z7uTxec1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><p>After he says: \u201cAnd for another&hellip; we have a Hulk.\u201d we clearly see how little that damn blue cube truly means to him. When he drops it to the ground and tackles Thor out of the way he makes a choice, one that is inevibably the one he was going to make all along, but one that surprised Thanos nonetheless. Loki doesn\u2019t even look at the Tesseract anymore, he just drops it and moves. It\u2019s not important to him at all.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b169a918f49544d70f6a27f06dc41de/tumblr_inline_pd4z8fpCPv1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><p>Those scenes are very important for multiple reasons. First, of course, is Loki\u2019s choice to save his brother, instead of the Tesseract. But, it also shows us something about Loki\u2019s acceptence of himself. He has called himself <i>Loki of Asgard</i> in Avengers, this is how Thanos <b><i>knows </i></b>him. Now, by rejecting his Asgardian heritage, Loki shows Thanos that he is not the man he knows anymore, that he is someone else. He is not his puppet anymore.</p><p>After this, Loki disappears for almost three and a half minutes. We do not know what he does while Heimdall dies and Hulk is sent to earth, but when he appears again something is different. Loki is almost cheerful, smiling and optimistic.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68586f3ec90e36210e8a98415a4769c4/tumblr_inline_pd4z9lTdNO1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f664f59c15ea706734d2e1448696a990/tumblr_inline_pd4z9jXxwf1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure><p>He is offering his help on Earth, which some might say is another moment in which he betrays Thor just to save his own skin. But there is so much more behind this. Loki doesn\u2019t expect Thanos to fall for this offer, he knows better than that. And he witnessed what happened in the minutes prior to this, how he killed Heimdall in cold blood. And still, when Thanos asks him if he considers failure experience, Loki shows that no, he does not consider <i>failure </i>experience, he considers <b>experience </b>experience.</p><p>All this though, is mainly a way to get close to Thanos again. Loki is anything but dumb, he knows that Thanos is too strong for them, that he could never possibly kill him. And still, he tries because this time he does not fight to save himself, he fights to save his brother. His speech, although seemingly directed at Thanos to prove his loyalty, is in reality directed at Thor and him alone.</p><p>When Loki says: \u201cOdinson&hellip;\u201d he looks at Thor, only at him. He finally, after all this time, accepts himself as Odinson, something he has rejected ever since he found out the truth about his heritage and has suffered through the pain coming with it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"265\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2f1e9d1afd0ccbe007ac7e4de26b343/tumblr_inline_pd4wc53Qeu1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"265\"/></figure><p>This look says it all. It\u2019s an apology he cannot word any different. It\u2019s Loki asking Thor to forgive him for what he is about to do. It\u2019s Loki saying \u2018There is no other way, brother\u2019. It\u2019s Loki saying \u2018I love you\u2019.</p><p>And Thor understands. No matter how Loki\u2019s words must sound to him, as soon as he sees the knife appearing in his brother\u2019s hands, Thor knows and he is scared to death.

When I watched this the first time, I cried. From the beginning to the end, I cried. Fifteen minutes of crying. And later, when I looked into the mirror, do you know how my eyes looked? Like this. Exactly like this.</p><p>Whatever Loki did during those 3 &frac12; minutes that he was gone, this moment shows me that part of it was crying. Because he realized there was only one way to protect his brother, only one way to save his life. He still has tears in his eyes here, it couldn\u2019t be any clearer how heartbroken Loki is and how much he knows that what he is about to do will turn out horribly.</p><p>Loki is scared, he still is when Thanos stops him and grabs his wrist, but despite his fear and looking his upcoming death right in the eye, Loki stares him down with everything he has left.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"252\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0306385447367d3b554fa875b0399695/tumblr_inline_pd4wm7OpNM1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"252\"/></figure><p>This is a face that says: \u201cI won\u2019t let you do this, I won\u2019t let you hurt him anymore.\u201d This is a face that says: \u201cI will not stop fighting you.\u201d And this is a face of pure and absolute determination.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"252\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3666e956008f59f88be11e58c1bc2ea/tumblr_inline_pd4wnowmHc1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"252\"/></figure><p>Even when Thanos twists his wrist and Loki is in pain, he does not look away, he does not give in. This is the ultimate moment, this is what he has to do to save Thor. And he will not back out, not this time. For once, Loki will not run away.</p><h2>&mdash;&ndash; WARNING: Loki\u2019s Death Scene Coming Up &mdash;&ndash;</h2><p>At this point, Loki knows that he will not make it out of this alive. When Thanos flicks the knife out of Loki\u2019s hand and grabs his throat, Loki is terrified. We do not see his face close up, thankfully, but we still see his eyes widen and hear his gargling gasp. And then, when Thanos lifts him up, we get a glimpse of just how scared Loki truly is.</p><p>Loki begins to struggle, he begins to fight. He lashes out, his self-preservation kicks in against all odds and he trashes around violently, grabbing Thanos desperately, gasping for air. It\u2019s a moment that is shattering to watch, because it shows just how much Loki panics and how helpless he is in the end. <br/></p><p>(References: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BXSk4mH9GghH7ME4KwwyBtdDWNqAESxF\">Gif 1</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ENQL1u80DkG1zOQZgJPxhbVF-rpGSYas\">Gif 2</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1noG4qAJUIOzfSyJPsfmLqr10GbgidVnc\">Gif 3</a>)</p><p>He has no chance, he never had one. Thor is forced to watch Loki struggle, forced to stay silent, but we see how it affects him. We see him shaking, we see him pleading in silence for this to stop, but he\u2019s rendered completely helpless too and can only watch everything unfold in horror.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/50135de5b65875cc683a4359e96fbd2c/tumblr_inline_pd4xb5tnr21uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><p>Thanos, of course, enjoys the suffering on Thor\u2019s face and smiles, turning to Loki. When the camera goes back to Loki, we can see just how cruel what Thanos does to him really is. Loki\u2019s eyes are starting to get bloodshot, a result of the force that his throat is squished with and of the pressure that made several blood vessels in his head burst, including his eyes. (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o0B3vUt8N6QtPIIb3rUQtLibDTeLA48t\">Still 1</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JLCnV3Ax4SmveBK9IsQ2jXzHlPo9wDUx\">Still 2</a>)</p><p>When he speaks (\u201dYou will never be a god\u201d), his voice is almost inaudible, a croaky and hoarse whisper with the last word even less than that. Thanos cuts off his air supply, Loki can barely breathe anymore and his larynx (which is connects the pharynx to the trachea and is responsible for the tonality and pitch of one\u2019s voice) is being squished. That he even manages to speak is a miracle in itself, but the way his voice sounds is ominous and dooming.</p><p>We all know what happens next. The snap. Thanos does this so easily, without any effort and it\u2019s the sound of Loki\u2019s neck breaking that marks the end of this gruesome and brutal death. And here, we finally see the true devastation this strangulation has caused.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1imGeQK5IOBP5OuhdyM1frNfxq7B8L7rs\">Reference Image</a>)</p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes are now completely blooshot, he bleeds from his eyes and his nose, the veins on his forehead are standing out and his mouth, too, is filled with blood. His skin has turned into a gray-ish color, a result of his lack of oxygen and bloodflow into his head. And, if you look at his left eye closely, you may see a slightly darker streak on his cheek below it, one that is not bloody. Yep, tears too. <br/></p><p>This illustrates perfectly just how brutal and painful Loki\u2019s death truly is. What we see is not even a fraction of what Loki felt. Being strangled like this is by no means painless and not only that, it\u2019s not a fast process either. Thanos let him feel <b><i>everything </i></b>in an agonizing and horribly slow way, he not only slowly suffocated Loki, but he also caused more and more blood vessels in his head to burst one by one, nothing any of us would want to experience while being held in the air by anyone.</p><p>And Thor? Thor watched <b>everything</b>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/708a8061a6267a7940da49957a8084e7/tumblr_inline_pd4yc7sZ2t1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7a938d60cb9231662de22ff18a0372a/tumblr_inline_pd4ycbqSDl1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"/></figure><p>Thor screams and we can see that this scream hurts himself too, shown by the blood dripping down his chin from beneath the metal muzzle. When Thanos finally drops Loki in front of Thor, we see nothing of the trickster we know anymore.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YG-scx02RYp9jHxVbueG5s2Eiv3qly6p\">Reference Image</a>)</p><p>But, before we go further, I have to mention one last thing. Yes, it has been said before, but I will say it again. Even after all of this, Loki might have still been <b>alive</b>. He could have survived the neck snap and choking, but they might have left him paralyzed and with his trachea crushed, ultimately leaving him to slowly suffocate without being able to move or speak or give away any hint that he was not dead yet.<br/></p><p>After Thanos and the others disappear, Thor\u2019s restrains fall off and he falls down next to his brother. This is one of the most heartbreaking moments, because when Thor crawls towards his brother, we can watch him slowly fall apart.</p><p>I made a separate gifset of this whole scene <a href=\"http://thorkified.tumblr.com/post/176730592922\">here</a>, but I will use some gifs of it to illustrate my thoughts here too.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a404dac04d1ee4ebe64778f0ce37617c/tumblr_inline_pd4ypvXnk51uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\"/></figure><p>Thor\u2019s desperate clutching at Loki\u2019s chest, how he slowly moves his hand to feel him, is horrible to watch. You can see that he still begs this is not real, that he still hopes against all hope that Loki did not die, that it was just an illusion and nothing more. He whispers his brother\u2019s name one last time, but when he gets no reaction it begins to sink in that this is not a trick. And this is when Thor breaks.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/87e59874c3917324e0466f3a20b069e1/tumblr_inline_pd4yx3v6pm1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\"/></figure><p>When he drops his head and collapses on his brother\u2019s body, Thor has given up completely. The realization that Loki is dead is too much for him. For Thor, it\u2019s like the world has ended and he accepts his own death as a consequence, refusing to leave his brother\u2019s side. He is willing to stay with him until the bitter end, willing to die in this explosion just so he will not be alone.</p><p>Because without Loki, Thor has nothing left in this world. Without Loki, everything becomes meaningless. His home is gone, his parents and friends and everything he fought for is gone and now his brother, the only one he had left, is dead in his arms too. There is no hope anymore for him.<br/></p><p>And the worst thing is, Loki might have still witnessed all of this; trapped in his dying body, unable to speak, unable to move. He might have felt Thor\u2019s desperation, his tears and his hands on him, without any chance to show it.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>And this concludes it. As I said, most of this has most likely been said before and I know this is just another one of those long and pointless analysis posts that we probably have in the millions by now, but I had to do it. Those are my personal views on this, so if you don\u2019t agree it\u2019s perfectly fine (just don\u2019t hijack this one please, it took quite some time to get this right and I would rather have it the way it is, thanks)<br/></p>",

First, of course, is Loki\u2019s choice to save his brother, instead of the Tesseract. But, it also shows us something about Loki\u2019s acceptence of himself. He has called himself <i>Loki of Asgard</i> in Avengers, this is how Thanos <b><i>knows </i></b>him. Now, by rejecting his Asgardian heritage, Loki shows Thanos that he is not the man he knows anymore, that he is someone else. He is not his puppet anymore.</p><p>After this, Loki disappears for almost three and a half minutes. We do not know what he does while Heimdall dies and Hulk is sent to earth, but when he appears again something is different.

And he witnessed what happened in the minutes prior to this, how he killed Heimdall in cold blood. And still, when Thanos asks him if he considers failure experience, Loki shows that no, he does not consider <i>failure </i>experience, he considers <b>experience </b>experience.</p><p>All this though, is mainly a way to get close to Thanos again. Loki is anything but dumb, he knows that Thanos is too strong for them, that he could never possibly kill him. And still, he tries because this time he does not fight to save himself, he fights to save his brother. His speech, although seemingly directed at Thanos to prove his loyalty, is in reality directed at Thor and him alone.</p><p>When Loki says: \u201cOdinson\u2026\u201d he looks at Thor, only at him.

Exactly like this.</p><p>Whatever Loki did during those 3 \u00bd minutes that he was gone, this moment shows me that part of it was crying. Because he realized there was only one way to protect his brother, only one way to save his life.

When Thanos flicks the knife out of Loki\u2019s hand and grabs his throat, Loki is terrified. We do not see his face close up, thankfully, but we still see his eyes widen and hear his gargling gasp. And then, when Thanos lifts him up, we get a glimpse of just how scared Loki truly is.</p><p>Loki begins to struggle, he begins to fight. He lashes out, his self-preservation kicks in against all odds and he trashes around violently, grabbing Thanos desperately, gasping for air. It\u2019s a moment that is shattering to watch, because it shows just how much Loki panics and how helpless he is in the end. <br></p><p>(References: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BXSk4mH9GghH7ME4KwwyBtdDWNqAESxF\">Gif 1</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ENQL1u80DkG1zOQZgJPxhbVF-rpGSYas\">Gif 2</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1noG4qAJUIOzfSyJPsfmLqr10GbgidVnc\">Gif 3</a>)</p><p>He has no chance, he never had one. Thor is forced to watch Loki struggle, forced to stay silent, but we see how it affects him. We see him shaking, we see him pleading in silence for this to stop, but he\u2019s rendered completely helpless too and can only watch everything unfold in horror.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/50135de5b65875cc683a4359e96fbd2c/tumblr_inline_pd4xb5tnr21uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"></figure><p>Thanos, of course, enjoys the suffering on Thor\u2019s face and smiles, turning to Loki. When the camera goes back to Loki, we can see just how cruel what Thanos does to him really is. Loki\u2019s eyes are starting to get bloodshot, a result of the force that his throat is squished with and of the pressure that made several blood vessels in his head burst, including his eyes. (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o0B3vUt8N6QtPIIb3rUQtLibDTeLA48t\">Still 1</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JLCnV3Ax4SmveBK9IsQ2jXzHlPo9wDUx\">Still 2</a>)</p><p>When he speaks (\u201dYou will never be a god\u201d), his voice is almost inaudible, a croaky and hoarse whisper with the last word even less than that. Thanos cuts off his air supply, Loki can barely breathe anymore and his larynx (which is connects the pharynx to the trachea and is responsible for the tonality and pitch of one\u2019s voice) is being squished. That he even manages to speak is a miracle in itself, but the way his voice sounds is ominous and dooming.</p><p>We all know what happens next. The snap. Thanos does this so easily, without any effort and it\u2019s the sound of Loki\u2019s neck breaking that marks the end of this gruesome and brutal death. And here, we finally see the true devastation this strangulation has caused.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1imGeQK5IOBP5OuhdyM1frNfxq7B8L7rs\">Reference Image</a>)</p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes are now completely blooshot, he bleeds from his eyes and his nose, the veins on his forehead are standing out and his mouth, too, is filled with blood. His skin has turned into a gray-ish color, a result of his lack of oxygen and bloodflow into his head. And, if you look at his left eye closely, you may see a slightly darker streak on his cheek below it, one that is not bloody. Yep, tears too. <br></p><p>This illustrates perfectly just how brutal and painful Loki\u2019s death truly is. What we see is not even a fraction of what Loki felt. Being strangled like this is by no means painless and not only that, it\u2019s not a fast process either. Thanos let him feel <b><i>everything </i></b>in an agonizing and horribly slow way, he not only slowly suffocated Loki, but he also caused more and more blood vessels in his head to burst one by one, nothing any of us would want to experience while being held in the air by anyone.</p><p>And Thor? Thor watched <b>everything</b>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/708a8061a6267a7940da49957a8084e7/tumblr_inline_pd4yc7sZ2t1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7a938d60cb9231662de22ff18a0372a/tumblr_inline_pd4ycbqSDl1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"></figure><p>Thor screams and we can see that this scream hurts himself too, shown by the blood dripping down his chin from beneath the metal muzzle. When Thanos finally drops Loki in front of Thor, we see nothing of the trickster we know anymore.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YG-scx02RYp9jHxVbueG5s2Eiv3qly6p\">Reference Image</a>)</p><p>But, before we go further, I have to mention one last thing. Yes, it has been said before, but I will say it again. Even after all of this, Loki might have still been <b>alive</b>. He could have survived the neck snap and choking, but they might have left him paralyzed and with his trachea crushed, ultimately leaving him to slowly suffocate without being able to move or speak or give away any hint that he was not dead yet.<br></p><p>After Thanos and the others disappear, Thor\u2019s restrains fall off and he falls down next to his brother. This is one of the most heartbreaking moments, because when Thor crawls towards his brother, we can watch him slowly fall apart.</p><p>I made a separate gifset of this whole scene <a href=\"http://thorkified.tumblr.com/post/176730592922\">here</a>, but I will use some gifs of it to illustrate my thoughts here too.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a404dac04d1ee4ebe64778f0ce37617c/tumblr_inline_pd4ypvXnk51uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\"></figure><p>Thor\u2019s desperate clutching at Loki\u2019s chest, how he slowly moves his hand to feel him, is horrible to watch. You can see that he still begs this is not real, that he still hopes against all hope that Loki did not die, that it was just an illusion and nothing more. He whispers his brother\u2019s name one last time, but when he gets no reaction it begins to sink in that this is not a trick. And this is when Thor breaks.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/87e59874c3917324e0466f3a20b069e1/tumblr_inline_pd4yx3v6pm1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\"></figure><p>When he drops his head and collapses on his brother\u2019s body, Thor has given up completely. The realization that Loki is dead is too much for him. For Thor, it\u2019s like the world has ended and he accepts his own death as a consequence, refusing to leave his brother\u2019s side. He is willing to stay with him until the bitter end, willing to die in this explosion just so he will not be alone.</p><p>Because without Loki, Thor has nothing left in this world. Without Loki, everything becomes meaningless. His home is gone, his parents and friends and everything he fought for is gone and now his brother, the only one he had left, is dead in his arms too. There is no hope anymore for him.<br></p><p>And the worst thing is, Loki might have still witnessed all of this; trapped in his dying body, unable to speak, unable to move. He might have felt Thor\u2019s desperation, his tears and his hands on him, without any chance to show it.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>And this concludes it. As I said, most of this has most likely been said before and I know this is just another one of those long and pointless analysis posts that we probably have in the millions by now, but I had to do it. Those are my personal views on this, so if you don\u2019t agree it\u2019s perfectly fine (just don\u2019t hijack this one please, it took quite some time to get this right and I would rather have it the way it is, thanks)<br></p>",

First, of course, is Loki\u2019s choice to save his brother, instead of the Tesseract. But, it also shows us something about Loki\u2019s acceptence of himself. He has called himself <i>Loki of Asgard</i> in Avengers, this is how Thanos <b><i>knows </i></b>him. Now, by rejecting his Asgardian heritage, Loki shows Thanos that he is not the man he knows anymore, that he is someone else. He is not his puppet anymore.</p><p>After this, Loki disappears for almost three and a half minutes. We do not know what he does while Heimdall dies and Hulk is sent to earth, but when he appears again something is different. Loki is almost cheerful, smiling and optimistic.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68586f3ec90e36210e8a98415a4769c4/tumblr_inline_pd4z9lTdNO1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f664f59c15ea706734d2e1448696a990/tumblr_inline_pd4z9jXxwf1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\"></figure><p>He is offering his help on Earth, which some might say is another moment in which he betrays Thor just to save his own skin. But there is so much more behind this. Loki doesn\u2019t expect Thanos to fall for this offer, he knows better than that. And he witnessed what happened in the minutes prior to this, how he killed Heimdall in cold blood. And still, when Thanos asks him if he considers failure experience, Loki shows that no, he does not consider <i>failure </i>experience, he considers <b>experience </b>experience.</p><p>All this though, is mainly a way to get close to Thanos again. Loki is anything but dumb, he knows that Thanos is too strong for them, that he could never possibly kill him. And still, he tries because this time he does not fight to save himself, he fights to save his brother. His speech, although seemingly directed at Thanos to prove his loyalty, is in reality directed at Thor and him alone.</p><p>When Loki says: \u201cOdinson\u2026\u201d he looks at Thor, only at him. He finally, after all this time, accepts himself as Odinson, something he has rejected ever since he found out the truth about his heritage and has suffered through the pain coming with it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"265\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2f1e9d1afd0ccbe007ac7e4de26b343/tumblr_inline_pd4wc53Qeu1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"265\"></figure><p>This look says it all.

It\u2019s Loki saying \u2018I love you\u2019.</p><p>And Thor understands. No matter how Loki\u2019s words must sound to him, as soon as he sees the knife appearing in his brother\u2019s hands, Thor knows and he is scared to death.

Exactly like this.</p><p>Whatever Loki did during those 3 \u00bd minutes that he was gone, this moment shows me that part of it was crying. Because he realized there was only one way to protect his brother, only one way to save his life.

When Thanos flicks the knife out of Loki\u2019s hand and grabs his throat, Loki is terrified. We do not see his face close up, thankfully, but we still see his eyes widen and hear his gargling gasp. And then, when Thanos lifts him up, we get a glimpse of just how scared Loki truly is.</p><p>Loki begins to struggle, he begins to fight. He lashes out, his self-preservation kicks in against all odds and he trashes around violently, grabbing Thanos desperately, gasping for air. It\u2019s a moment that is shattering to watch, because it shows just how much Loki panics and how helpless he is in the end. <br></p><p>(References: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BXSk4mH9GghH7ME4KwwyBtdDWNqAESxF\">Gif 1</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ENQL1u80DkG1zOQZgJPxhbVF-rpGSYas\">Gif 2</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1noG4qAJUIOzfSyJPsfmLqr10GbgidVnc\">Gif 3</a>)</p><p>He has no chance, he never had one.

When the camera goes back to Loki, we can see just how cruel what Thanos does to him really is. Loki\u2019s eyes are starting to get bloodshot, a result of the force that his throat is squished with and of the pressure that made several blood vessels in his head burst, including his eyes. (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o0B3vUt8N6QtPIIb3rUQtLibDTeLA48t\">Still 1</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JLCnV3Ax4SmveBK9IsQ2jXzHlPo9wDUx\">Still 2</a>)</p><p>When he speaks (\u201dYou will never be a god\u201d), his voice is almost inaudible, a croaky and hoarse whisper with the last word even less than that. Thanos cuts off his air supply, Loki can barely breathe anymore and his larynx (which is connects the pharynx to the trachea and is responsible for the tonality and pitch of one\u2019s voice) is being squished. That he even manages to speak is a miracle in itself, but the way his voice sounds is ominous and dooming.</p><p>We all know what happens next. The snap. Thanos does this so easily, without any effort and it\u2019s the sound of Loki\u2019s neck breaking that marks the end of this gruesome and brutal death. And here, we finally see the true devastation this strangulation has caused.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1imGeQK5IOBP5OuhdyM1frNfxq7B8L7rs\">Reference Image</a>)</p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes are now completely blooshot, he bleeds from his eyes and his nose, the veins on his forehead are standing out and his mouth, too, is filled with blood. His skin has turned into a gray-ish color, a result of his lack of oxygen and bloodflow into his head. And, if you look at his left eye closely, you may see a slightly darker streak on his cheek below it, one that is not bloody. Yep, tears too. <br></p><p>This illustrates perfectly just how brutal and painful Loki\u2019s death truly is. What we see is not even a fraction of what Loki felt. Being strangled like this is by no means painless and not only that, it\u2019s not a fast process either. Thanos let him feel <b><i>everything </i></b>in an agonizing and horribly slow way, he not only slowly suffocated Loki, but he also caused more and more blood vessels in his head to burst one by one, nothing any of us would want to experience while being held in the air by anyone.</p><p>And Thor? Thor watched <b>everything</b>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/708a8061a6267a7940da49957a8084e7/tumblr_inline_pd4yc7sZ2t1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7a938d60cb9231662de22ff18a0372a/tumblr_inline_pd4ycbqSDl1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"233\"></figure><p>Thor screams and we can see that this scream hurts himself too, shown by the blood dripping down his chin from beneath the metal muzzle.

Yes, it has been said before, but I will say it again. Even after all of this, Loki might have still been <b>alive</b>. He could have survived the neck snap and choking, but they might have left him paralyzed and with his trachea crushed, ultimately leaving him to slowly suffocate without being able to move or speak or give away any hint that he was not dead yet.<br></p><p>After Thanos and the others disappear, Thor\u2019s restrains fall off and he falls down next to his brother. This is one of the most heartbreaking moments, because when Thor crawls towards his brother, we can watch him slowly fall apart.</p><p>I made a separate gifset of this whole scene <a href=\"http://thorkified.tumblr.com/post/176730592922\">here</a>, but I will use some gifs of it to illustrate my thoughts here too.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a404dac04d1ee4ebe64778f0ce37617c/tumblr_inline_pd4ypvXnk51uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\"></figure><p>Thor\u2019s desperate clutching at Loki\u2019s chest, how he slowly moves his hand to feel him, is horrible to watch. You can see that he still begs this is not real, that he still hopes against all hope that Loki did not die, that it was just an illusion and nothing more. He whispers his brother\u2019s name one last time, but when he gets no reaction it begins to sink in that this is not a trick. And this is when Thor breaks.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/87e59874c3917324e0466f3a20b069e1/tumblr_inline_pd4yx3v6pm1uyms7l_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"226\"></figure><p>When he drops his head and collapses on his brother\u2019s body, Thor has given up completely. The realization that Loki is dead is too much for him. For Thor, it\u2019s like the world has ended and he accepts his own death as a consequence, refusing to leave his brother\u2019s side. He is willing to stay with him until the bitter end, willing to die in this explosion just so he will not be alone.</p><p>Because without Loki, Thor has nothing left in this world. Without Loki, everything becomes meaningless. His home is gone, his parents and friends and everything he fought for is gone and now his brother, the only one he had left, is dead in his arms too. There is no hope anymore for him.<br></p><p>And the worst thing is, Loki might have still witnessed all of this; trapped in his dying body, unable to speak, unable to move. He might have felt Thor\u2019s desperation, his tears and his hands on him, without any chance to show it.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>And this concludes it. As I said, most of this has most likely been said before and I know this is just another one of those long and pointless analysis posts that we probably have in the millions by now, but I had to do it. Those are my personal views on this, so if you don\u2019t agree it\u2019s perfectly fine (just don\u2019t hijack this one please, it took quite some time to get this right and I would rather have it the way it is, thanks)<br></p>",

We do not know what he does while Heimdall dies and Hulk is sent to earth, but when he appears again something is different. Loki is almost cheerful, smiling and optimistic.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68586f3ec90e36210e8a98415a4769c4/tumblr_inline_pd4z9lTdNO1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f664f59c15ea706734d2e1448696a990/tumblr_inline_pd4z9jXxwf1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>He is offering his help on Earth, which some might say is another moment in which he betrays Thor just to save his own skin. But there is so much more behind this. Loki doesn&rsquo;t expect Thanos to fall for this offer, he knows better than that. And he witnessed what happened in the minutes prior to this, how he killed Heimdall in cold blood. And still, when Thanos asks him if he considers failure experience, Loki shows that no, he does not consider <i>failure </i>experience, he considers <b>experience </b>experience.</p><p>All this though, is mainly a way to get close to Thanos again. Loki is anything but dumb, he knows that Thanos is too strong for them, that he could never possibly kill him. And still, he tries because this time he does not fight to save himself, he fights to save his brother. His speech, although seemingly directed at Thanos to prove his loyalty, is in reality directed at Thor and him alone.</p><p>When Loki says: &ldquo;Odinson&hellip;&rdquo; he looks at Thor, only at him. He finally, after all this time, accepts himself as Odinson, something he has rejected ever since he found out the truth about his heritage and has suffered through the pain coming with it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2f1e9d1afd0ccbe007ac7e4de26b343/tumblr_inline_pd4wc53Qeu1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This look says it all. It&rsquo;s an apology he cannot word any different. It&rsquo;s Loki asking Thor to forgive him for what he is about to do. It&rsquo;s Loki saying &lsquo;There is no other way, brother&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s Loki saying &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;.</p><p>And Thor understands. No matter how Loki&rsquo;s words must sound to him, as soon as he sees the knife appearing in his brother&rsquo;s hands, Thor knows and he is scared to death. We do not hear him, but his expression makes it clear that he says/thinks &ldquo;No!&rdquo;.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b92ba978470b71f2fac22f210fcf8898/tumblr_inline_pd4we1Tf5K1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And then comes a moment that is very, VERY important in my eyes.

When I watched this the first time, I cried. From the beginning to the end, I cried. Fifteen minutes of crying. And later, when I looked into the mirror, do you know how my eyes looked? Like this. Exactly like this.</p><p>Whatever Loki did during those 3 &frac12; minutes that he was gone, this moment shows me that part of it was crying. Because he realized there was only one way to protect his brother, only one way to save his life. He still has tears in his eyes here, it couldn&rsquo;t be any clearer how heartbroken Loki is and how much he knows that what he is about to do will turn out horribly.</p><p>Loki is scared, he still is when Thanos stops him and grabs his wrist, but despite his fear and looking his upcoming death right in the eye, Loki stares him down with everything he has left.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0306385447367d3b554fa875b0399695/tumblr_inline_pd4wm7OpNM1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is a face that says: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you do this, I won&rsquo;t let you hurt him anymore.&rdquo; This is a face that says: &ldquo;I will not stop fighting you.&rdquo; And this is a face of pure and absolute determination.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3666e956008f59f88be11e58c1bc2ea/tumblr_inline_pd4wnowmHc1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Even when Thanos twists his wrist and Loki is in pain, he does not look away, he does not give in. This is the ultimate moment, this is what he has to do to save Thor. And he will not back out, not this time. For once, Loki will not run away.</p><h2>&mdash;&ndash; WARNING: Loki&rsquo;s Death Scene Coming Up &mdash;&ndash;</h2><p>At this point, Loki knows that he will not make it out of this alive. When Thanos flicks the knife out of Loki&rsquo;s hand and grabs his throat, Loki is terrified. We do not see his face close up, thankfully, but we still see his eyes widen and hear his gargling gasp. And then, when Thanos lifts him up, we get a glimpse of just how scared Loki truly is.</p><p>Loki begins to struggle, he begins to fight. He lashes out, his self-preservation kicks in against all odds and he trashes around violently, grabbing Thanos desperately, gasping for air. It&rsquo;s a moment that is shattering to watch, because it shows just how much Loki panics and how helpless he is in the end. <br /></p><p>(References: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BXSk4mH9GghH7ME4KwwyBtdDWNqAESxF\">Gif 1</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ENQL1u80DkG1zOQZgJPxhbVF-rpGSYas\">Gif 2</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1noG4qAJUIOzfSyJPsfmLqr10GbgidVnc\">Gif 3</a>)</p><p>He has no chance, he never had one. Thor is forced to watch Loki struggle, forced to stay silent, but we see how it affects him. We see him shaking, we see him pleading in silence for this to stop, but he&rsquo;s rendered completely helpless too and can only watch everything unfold in horror.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/50135de5b65875cc683a4359e96fbd2c/tumblr_inline_pd4xb5tnr21uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Thanos, of course, enjoys the suffering on Thor&rsquo;s face and smiles, turning to Loki. When the camera goes back to Loki, we can see just how cruel what Thanos does to him really is. Loki&rsquo;s eyes are starting to get bloodshot, a result of the force that his throat is squished with and of the pressure that made several blood vessels in his head burst, including his eyes. (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o0B3vUt8N6QtPIIb3rUQtLibDTeLA48t\">Still 1</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JLCnV3Ax4SmveBK9IsQ2jXzHlPo9wDUx\">Still 2</a>)</p><p>When he speaks (&rdquo;You will never be a god&rdquo;), his voice is almost inaudible, a croaky and hoarse whisper with the last word even less than that. Thanos cuts off his air supply, Loki can barely breathe anymore and his larynx (which is connects the pharynx to the trachea and is responsible for the tonality and pitch of one&rsquo;s voice) is being squished. That he even manages to speak is a miracle in itself, but the way his voice sounds is ominous and dooming.</p><p>We all know what happens next. The snap. Thanos does this so easily, without any effort and it&rsquo;s the sound of Loki&rsquo;s neck breaking that marks the end of this gruesome and brutal death. And here, we finally see the true devastation this strangulation has caused.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1imGeQK5IOBP5OuhdyM1frNfxq7B8L7rs\">Reference Image</a>)</p><p>Loki&rsquo;s eyes are now completely blooshot, he bleeds from his eyes and his nose, the veins on his forehead are standing out and his mouth, too, is filled with blood. His skin has turned into a gray-ish color, a result of his lack of oxygen and bloodflow into his head. And, if you look at his left eye closely, you may see a slightly darker streak on his cheek below it, one that is not bloody. Yep, tears too. <br /></p><p>This illustrates perfectly just how brutal and painful Loki&rsquo;s death truly is. What we see is not even a fraction of what Loki felt. Being strangled like this is by no means painless and not only that, it&rsquo;s not a fast process either. Thanos let him feel <b><i>everything </i></b>in an agonizing and horribly slow way, he not only slowly suffocated Loki, but he also caused more and more blood vessels in his head to burst one by one, nothing any of us would want to experience while being held in the air by anyone.</p><p>And Thor? Thor watched <b>everything</b>.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/708a8061a6267a7940da49957a8084e7/tumblr_inline_pd4yc7sZ2t1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7a938d60cb9231662de22ff18a0372a/tumblr_inline_pd4ycbqSDl1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Thor screams and we can see that this scream hurts himself too, shown by the blood dripping down his chin from beneath the metal muzzle. When Thanos finally drops Loki in front of Thor, we see nothing of the trickster we know anymore.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YG-scx02RYp9jHxVbueG5s2Eiv3qly6p\">Reference Image</a>)</p><p>But, before we go further, I have to mention one last thing. Yes, it has been said before, but I will say it again. Even after all of this, Loki might have still been <b>alive</b>. He could have survived the neck snap and choking, but they might have left him paralyzed and with his trachea crushed, ultimately leaving him to slowly suffocate without being able to move or speak or give away any hint that he was not dead yet.<br /></p><p>After Thanos and the others disappear, Thor&rsquo;s restrains fall off and he falls down next to his brother. This is one of the most heartbreaking moments, because when Thor crawls towards his brother, we can watch him slowly fall apart.</p><p>I made a separate gifset of this whole scene <a href=\"http://thorkified.tumblr.com/post/176730592922\">here</a>, but I will use some gifs of it to illustrate my thoughts here too.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a404dac04d1ee4ebe64778f0ce37617c/tumblr_inline_pd4ypvXnk51uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Thor&rsquo;s desperate clutching at Loki&rsquo;s chest, how he slowly moves his hand to feel him, is horrible to watch. You can see that he still begs this is not real, that he still hopes against all hope that Loki did not die, that it was just an illusion and nothing more. He whispers his brother&rsquo;s name one last time, but when he gets no reaction it begins to sink in that this is not a trick. And this is when Thor breaks.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/87e59874c3917324e0466f3a20b069e1/tumblr_inline_pd4yx3v6pm1uyms7l_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>When he drops his head and collapses on his brother&rsquo;s body, Thor has given up completely. The realization that Loki is dead is too much for him. For Thor, it&rsquo;s like the world has ended and he accepts his own death as a consequence, refusing to leave his brother&rsquo;s side. He is willing to stay with him until the bitter end, willing to die in this explosion just so he will not be alone.</p><p>Because without Loki, Thor has nothing left in this world. Without Loki, everything becomes meaningless. His home is gone, his parents and friends and everything he fought for is gone and now his brother, the only one he had left, is dead in his arms too. There is no hope anymore for him.<br /></p><p>And the worst thing is, Loki might have still witnessed all of this; trapped in his dying body, unable to speak, unable to move. He might have felt Thor&rsquo;s desperation, his tears and his hands on him, without any chance to show it.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>And this concludes it. As I said, most of this has most likely been said before and I know this is just another one of those long and pointless analysis posts that we probably have in the millions by now, but I had to do it. Those are my personal views on this, so if you don&rsquo;t agree it&rsquo;s perfectly fine (just don&rsquo;t hijack this one please, it took quite some time to get this right and I would rather have it the way it is, thanks)<br /></p>",
