        "body": "<h2><a href=\"https://tyruskoodman.tumblr.com/post/181970547906/where-it-all-began-chapter-14\">Previous Chapter</a></h2><hr><p>The planning for the wedding went amazingly. In just 3 to 4 months, Cyrus Goodman and TJ Kippen were happily married. To make it less confusing, none of them chose to take any last names; but they were still completely fine with their decisions.</p><p>The real reason why they didn&rsquo;t take each other&rsquo;s last names was became their names already sounded badass anyway, so why would they change them?</p><p>That&rsquo;s what TJ thought, and Cyrus happily agreed.</p><p>Andi and Walker graduated their respective colleges and flocked back to Shadyside, where they ended up working at the same art studio. They became best friends, and helped each other make art, reminding them both of Walker&rsquo;s mural that they did together back in 8th grade.</p><p>Marty and Buffy got together, leaving their &ldquo;virtual relationship&rdquo; days behind them. They moved in together, and got ready to start a family. Buffy&rsquo;s athleticism was still there, and became a PE coach at Jefferson, while Marty became a PE coach at Grant. They were soulmates, which was part of the reason why Marty proposed to Buffy when he dropped her off at Jefferson one day. They got happily engaged, and were planning to start a family once they were ready to.</p><p>Amber ended up getting married to Andi, with the help of Walker. Walker made a painting of Andi, which hid secret words in the painting, which Andi was oblivious to. Amber had to help her out with finding the words. It took over 2 hours, but it was all worth it in the end. Once Andi said the words, &ldquo;will you marry me&rdquo;, Amber was already on one knee.</p><p>Walker and Jonah got married around the same time TJ and Cyrus did. They lived a happy and chill life, without any kids, which they were going to plan later in their life. Jonah became a musician, and started to perform gigs around the city, state, and later around the country. He gave a lot of credit to Bowie, who taught him how to play the guitar in the first place. Jonah decided to start saying docious magocious again, which made Buffy extremely happy.</p><p>Lastly, we get back to TJ and Cyrus. They started their family fairly quickly, and ended up adopting two kids - a boy and a girl. Their names were CJ and Rosie. Cyrus continued to go to film school, even after starting his family with TJ. Once Cyrus was finished with film school, he went back to college to study Psychology, to make his parents proud. Once Cyrus was finished with that, he decided to work at Jefferson, where he became the guidance counselor and also helped out with the Film Club. Both of his degrees were all worth it. Despite TJ not being drafted into the NBA, he too decided to work at Jefferson, becoming the basketball coach. He decided to tell his captaincy stories, which bored out the team a lot, but inspired them.</p><p>All of our people decided to move back to Shadyside, where they all met, and where they all will stay for the rest of their lives.</p><p>CJ and Rosie looked out the car window. Their lives in Shadyside were pretty good. They had the best parents in the world, as they looked in front of them.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in loooooveeeeee.&rdquo; Rosie teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Rosie, sit down. We don&rsquo;t need to tease you about Jason, do we?&rdquo; TJ replied, as he parked the car.</p><p>Rosie sat down in her seat, turning red due to embarrassment. CJ looked out the car window in astonishment as he adjusted his glasses. Despite being adopted, CJ already had traits from Cyrus. He was unathletic, smart, and so many other things. Rosie took from TJ. She was athletic, played basketball, and decided to try out for the basketball team, where Buffy was the coach.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright guys, we&rsquo;re here - get out of the car.&rdquo; Cyrus announced, as he opened the car door for everyone.</p><p>TJ and Cyrus looked at each other. They were happily married with their muffin wedding rings, and they finally got their life started. They watched as CJ and Rosie, despite being middle schoolers, enjoying their time on the playground.</p><p>&ldquo;That was us, right?&rdquo; TJ asked, kissing Cyrus on the cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, we were just on the swings the entire time telling each other about our stuff.&rdquo; Cyrus replied, blushing.</p><p>As CJ and Rosie were playing tag on the playground, TJ and Cyrus decided to go over to the swings.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you still do an underdog?&rdquo; Cyrus asked playfully.</p><p>TJ looked at Cyrus as if he was asking the dumbest question in the world. &ldquo;Of COURSE I can!&rdquo; He replied, as he got off his swing.

TJ\u2019s math book sat open on the Goodman\u2019s coffee table, his practice test sitting on his lap, where Cyrus practically was, too. TJ repeated the mantra in his head, that \u201cthis is normal, pay attention.

Seriously?\u201d Cyrus huffed, and TJ tore his gaze from the window, where he was presumably zoning out. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to pass if you don\u2019t pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just\u2026 a little overwhelmed. Do you think that we could take a break for a minute?\u201d TJ\u2019s voice sounded small, and Cyrus seemed to soften a little at that, before a worried expression took over his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been working for a while. Sorry.\u201d He looked sheepish and immediately stood up, stretching his arms above his head. \u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d he asked as he walked away, his head still partially turned toward TJ.</p><p>TJ sat up straight and looked behind his shoulder to where Cyrus was entering the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some water.\u201d TJ said, noticing how dry his throat was. He quickly removed his sweatshirt and peered back to the kitchen entryway again, leaning back a little farther until he could see Cyrus, who seemed to be trying to calm down. TJ leaned back so far he felt the couch begin to tip under the weight shift, and quickly leaned forward, his heart and stomach lurching. A moment later, Cyrus arrived with two glasses of water and a plate of crackers.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much in the way of snacks, but crackers are always nice.\u201d He smiled softly, and TJ couldn\u2019t help but smile back. Cyrus sat down again, this time a little farther away from TJ than he was before. TJ picked a cracker from the tray, munching and avoiding eye contact with Cyrus until he could extinguish this startling new feeling of disappointment.</p><p>Cyrus opened the math book again, and TJ was able to pay attention for a record 5 minutes, before he found himself inching closer to Cyrus. He wondered if he had always been the one to scoot closer, or if the other boy also craved the close proximity. Soon again, after a few problems, their legs were touching, and Cyrus was leaning across TJ to point to problems and numbers that TJ was once again having trouble focusing on.</p><p>TJ leaned forward to turn the page, meeting Cyrus who had also moved to turn it. TJ wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever been this close to Cyrus\u2019 face before. He could feel his breath, and he could see just how impossibly long Cyrus\u2019 eyelashes were. TJ felt his heart beat once, hard. Then twice, then a million times with wild abandon. Their hands were hovering over the page corner &ndash; so close, but not actually touching. Cyrus blushed and then leaned back. A millisecond that felt like an eternity. A laugh bubbled up from TJ, and he turned the page.</p><p>An awkward silence descended for only moments, before they were right back to where they were before, with TJ zoning out and Cyrus being impossibly close.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve done enough for today, it\u2019s getting pretty late.\u201d Cyrus admitted eventually.

Legs touching, arms brushing against each other, leaning closer to look at whatever was in front of them. TJ could hardly think of a time when Cyrus didn\u2019t sit this close to him. He couldn\u2019t, however, think of any of those times that had as much of an effect on him as right now. TJ\u2019s math book sat open on the Goodman\u2019s coffee table, his practice test sitting on his lap, where Cyrus practically was, too. TJ repeated the mantra in his head, that \u201cthis is normal, pay attention. This is normal\u201d, but in the past few weeks, almost everything about how TJ thought of his friend seemed to scream<i> not </i>normal.<b><br></b></p><p>TJ\u2019s heart rattled, echoing in his ribcage. Although it was snowing in blankets outside, TJ felt the overwhelming need to remove his sweater. He took a shaky breath in and out and rubbed his sweaty palms against his jeans.</p><p>\u201cTJ? Seriously?\u201d Cyrus huffed, and TJ tore his gaze from the window, where he was presumably zoning out. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to pass if you don\u2019t pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just\u2026 a little overwhelmed. Do you think that we could take a break for a minute?\u201d TJ\u2019s voice sounded small, and Cyrus seemed to soften a little at that, before a worried expression took over his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been working for a while. Sorry.\u201d He looked sheepish and immediately stood up, stretching his arms above his head. \u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d he asked as he walked away, his head still partially turned toward TJ.</p><p>TJ sat up straight and looked behind his shoulder to where Cyrus was entering the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some water.\u201d TJ said, noticing how dry his throat was. He quickly removed his sweatshirt and peered back to the kitchen entryway again, leaning back a little farther until he could see Cyrus, who seemed to be trying to calm down. TJ leaned back so far he felt the couch begin to tip under the weight shift, and quickly leaned forward, his heart and stomach lurching. A moment later, Cyrus arrived with two glasses of water and a plate of crackers.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much in the way of snacks, but crackers are always nice.\u201d He smiled softly, and TJ couldn\u2019t help but smile back. Cyrus sat down again, this time a little farther away from TJ than he was before. TJ picked a cracker from the tray, munching and avoiding eye contact with Cyrus until he could extinguish this startling new feeling of disappointment.</p><p>Cyrus opened the math book again, and TJ was able to pay attention for a record 5 minutes, before he found himself inching closer to Cyrus. He wondered if he had always been the one to scoot closer, or if the other boy also craved the close proximity. Soon again, after a few problems, their legs were touching, and Cyrus was leaning across TJ to point to problems and numbers that TJ was once again having trouble focusing on.</p><p>TJ leaned forward to turn the page, meeting Cyrus who had also moved to turn it. TJ wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever been this close to Cyrus\u2019 face before. He could feel his breath, and he could see just how impossibly long Cyrus\u2019 eyelashes were. TJ felt his heart beat once, hard. Then twice, then a million times with wild abandon. Their hands were hovering over the page corner \u2013 so close, but not actually touching. Cyrus blushed and then leaned back. A millisecond that felt like an eternity. A laugh bubbled up from TJ, and he turned the page.</p><p>An awkward silence descended for only moments, before they were right back to where they were before, with TJ zoning out and Cyrus being impossibly close.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve done enough for today, it\u2019s getting pretty late.\u201d Cyrus admitted eventually. TJ felt simultaneous relief and disappointment as he closed his book and slid it into his backpack.<br></p><p>\u201cAgreed. I think the test tomorrow isn\u2019t going to be so bad. Thanks for the help, Cyrus. Really.\u201d TJ flashed a genuine smile at Cyrus and felt his own face heat up.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course. You know I\u2019m always here to help.\u201d Cyrus tapped TJ\u2019s leg before standing up, grabbing their snack dishes from the table.<br></p><p>\u201cWait, Cy.\u201d TJ mumbled, standing up and slinging his backpack over his shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Cyrus looked up at him through his lashes and TJ felt his heartbeat quicken again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing. See you tomorrow.\u201d TJ settled on his response and quickly walked out the door.<br></p><p>So, maybe the way he felt about Cyrus Goodman was anything but normal, but he would figure that out after he passed his math test.</p>",
