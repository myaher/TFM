You\u2019re starting your first day at your new job. It has been your dream job since you were a little girl, following in your father\u2019s footsteps by joining the BAU. He\u2019s always given you tips throughout the years, helping you impress the professors and trainers when it came down to testing.</p><p>Because of your father, your name was known, therefore you were meant to impress always, not wanting to lose the reputation as being one of the best, just like your father was.</p><p>You weren\u2019t forced into this type of work either, which is why it\u2019s also such a big deal to you. You did this because you wanted to find the bad guys and help the good ones, not because of the reputation you brought. Your father never failed to remind you that you did this yourself, that if they only want you for your name, then they didn\u2019t deserve you, and that\u2019s stuck with you ever since you\u2019ve graduated.</p><p>\u201cDetective Y/L/N!\u201d Your name is yelled by your boss as soon as you walk into the building. Walking over to him, you watch as he gestures to the person on the right, both of you go to shake hands as a greeting, smiling softly. \u201cThis is Harry Styles, he\u2019ll be your partner until I decide he\u2019s not.\u201d Agent Larson says, a small smile on his face. You and Harry part and you give your attention back to your captain.</p><p>\u201cHarry has been here for a little over a year now, he\u2019s one of the best agents here. His last partner had some problems, which is why this spot was opened up so quickly. He\u2019ll help you with the in and outs of the force, helping you with what you should be doing and what you shouldn\u2019t. Is that clear?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d You exclaim and nod, him giving you a hard nod himself before walking away. You look at Harry and watch as his smile is cleared off of his face as soon as the captain turns his back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Y/L/N\u2019s daughter?\u201d He questions, you barely get out a \u201cyes\u201d before he cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cYeh understand I\u2019m not gonna treat yeh any different than I would with anyone else, righ\u2019?\u201d You smile, tilting your head to the side with content.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted, Styles. Now, can you show me where my desk is so I can start working please?\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>You are not what Harry was expecting. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was expecting, but he wasn\u2019t expecting someone to be so excited over a job like this. The Behavioral Analysis Unit could look exciting when you\u2019re in college and in training, but not when you\u2019re living in the reality of it.</p><p>\u201cThis is your desk.\u201d He says, pointing to a desk that\u2019s in front of his own. \u201c\u2018M over here, so yeh know. If yeh need me I\u2019m righ\u2019 here.\u201d</p><p>He had just got done giving you the tour of the building. Where the conference room is, where all the computers are, where Agent Larson&rsquo;s office is, and so on.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he sighed, \u201cAny questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any work for me to do?\u201d You inquired, putting your briefcase down on your desk and shrugging your jacket off.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have some work that needs to be finished if yeh-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You cut him off, startling Harry in the process, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d He questions, not understanding fully why you told him \u2018no\u2019 in the small fraction of time that you\u2019ve known him.</p><p>\u201cYou could treat me like you would anyone else, but I\u2019m <i>not</i>\u00a0anyone else. I\u2019m here to do my own work, not finish off yours. So, is there any work for me to do, partner?\u201d</p><p>He clenches his jaw, his mind trying to wrap around the fact that you just gave him attitude, on the first day he may add! He can\u2019t get a word out before he\u2019s interrupted by agent Larson.</p><p>\u201cStyles, Y/L/N, we just got a call from the offices in New York. Conference room, now.\u201d He states, swiftly walking through the conference room doors.</p><p>You both walk in, and you begin to pull a notebook and pen out, and Harry is confused as to why you would, considering the team gets the files anyhow.</p><p>\u201cAgent Horan, begin talking please.\u201d That\u2019s when he sees you writing. He watches as you neatly but quickly jot down Niall\u2019s name, well, \u201cHoran,\u201d and describe what he looks like. He has to admit, it\u2019s something he wishes he did when he joined the team. It would\u2019ve saved him the embarrassment of mixing up people\u2019s names, turning him into a stuttering mess for a whole week.</p><p>\u201cSo, as you\u2019ve heard, the New York offices called and they need our help, there\u2019s been another victim, Sarah Brown, making her the 5th kill in 2 weeks. All of them have been women, in their mid-20s with the same hair color, brunette. All clothing is removed besides their bra and underwear, with no clothing left at the scene.\u201d He announced, handing out the files of the victims that include their pictures of what they looked like on the scene, as well as pulling it up on a big screen.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all been murdered in the same way as well. Practically out in the open with a broken neck and a range of stab wounds, less stabs as more victims were killed. Doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Niall mutters out, looking at the pictures in confusion.</p><p>\u201cHe breaks their neck because it\u2019s quick, and then talks his guilt out by stabbing them repeatedly.\u201d You speculated, squinting at the pictures as well. All heads turn to you. You snap your head up and give a small smile, \u201cHi, Agent Y/N Y/L/N, I\u2019m new here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re sayin\u2019 that the more he kills, the fewer stab wounds we\u2019ll see?\u201d Niall questions you, and you nod, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as he\u2019s getting used t\u2019killing people, the less guilty he feels.\u201d Harry began, \u201cmeaning he\u2019ll be harder to find if all he\u2019s doin\u2019 is snapping necks.\u201d He mutters out, closing the files harshly, you nodding in confirmation.</p><p>\u201cWhich <i>really</i> means that time is running out. We need to stop him before it gets to that point of only snapping necks.\u201d Agent Larson says, the room muttering out their agreements.</p><p>\u201cDo the women have any correlation with each other?\u201d A redheaded girl asks.</p><p>\u201cThey all went to NYU.\u201d And the whole room groans. New York University has over 50,000 students in it and considering that the victims graduated 4-5 years ago, it\u2019s not going to be easy.</p><p>\u201cOkay team,\u201d Larson starts, \u201cWe have lives to save, grab your stuff and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As you\u2019re settling down in the jet, you learn who everyone is. Horan, who goes by Niall or his last name, is the person who gets the information and talks to the press and such. The redhead, Claire, is Liam\u2019s partner. Liam is someone that Harry briefly introduced you to on the tour of the office, a good work friend of his. They basically do what you and Harry do, but they just hold more of the information and lack some of the skill, that\u2019s what Harry tells you anyways.</p><p>That\u2019s where you and Harry come in, with the brains <i>and</i>\u00a0skills. There\u2019s no offense to Claire and Liam, they\u2019re trained and all, it\u2019s just they\u2019d be more hesitant with pulling the trigger than you or Harry.</p><p>Since the victim was found this morning, you and Harry were instructed to go to the scene to scope things out as soon as the jet has landed. You were given a car and address to go, and Harry gets in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p><p>Harry begins driving before he talks, \u201cListen,\u201d he starts, Y/N turning slightly to face him, \u201cI want t\u2019get along. I\u2019m sorry if it sounded like I was just givin\u2019 yeh my scraps, but I jus\u2019 wanted to show yeh what kind of work you\u2019d be gettin\u2019, never wanted yeh to do it for me, love.\u201d</p><p>You gasp, \u201cHarry I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d You apologize, \u201cI\u2019m just used to people wanting to walk all over me because of my dad, I just wanted to be clear about what kind of person I am before you got a chance to do whatever you wanted to me, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>Now Harry feels guilty about making <i>her</i>\u00a0feel bad. \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it! Hi, I\u2019m Harry, the best partner you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d He states cheekily, grinning as he takes his eyes off the road to glance at his partner before bringing his attention back to the road.</p><p>You giggle, \u201cI\u2019m Y/N, a pleasure to be working with you.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Harry\u2019s talking to a police officer at the crime scene, while you\u2019re walking around the scene. As you\u2019re walking, you notice something on the body. \u201cHarry! C\u2019mere.\u201d You shout, squatting down to get a better look.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He wonders, putting sterile gloves on and squatting with you.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not blood on her cheek.\u201d You observed, pointing to the exact spot you\u2019re talking about without touching it. Harry looks at the cheek intently, nodding as he seems to understand where you\u2019re going with that accusation.</p><p>\u201cLipstick.\u201d He states, you nodding before asking if the police could run some tests in their labs on the lipstick stain for a confirmation.</p><p>He takes his gloves off and reaches for the files of the previous victims, them all having the same \u201cblood\u201d mark on their cheeks. You walk over and peer at the documents, noticing what he just saw.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a he.\u201d He states. You shake your head and smiling. \u201cNope!\u201d You agree, \u201cIt\u2019s a she! Gosh, this just got so much more interesting!\u201d You smile, giddy with excitement.</p><p>Harry laughs at you in amusement,\u00a0\u201cSure it did, Y/N. Nice work.\u201d He smirks, walking back to the car as you smile to yourself. You can already tell that you and Harry are going to make great partners, and it\u2019s only the beginning. But before you think about the future, you need to think about finding the killer on the loose.\u00a0</p>",

Where the conference room is, where all the computers are, where Agent Larson\u2019s office is, and so on.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he sighed, \u201cAny questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any work for me to do?\u201d You inquired, putting your briefcase down on your desk and shrugging your jacket off.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have some work that needs to be finished if yeh-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You cut him off, startling Harry in the process, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d He questions, not understanding fully why you told him \u2018no\u2019 in the small fraction of time that you\u2019ve known him.</p><p>\u201cYou could treat me like you would anyone else, but I\u2019m <i>not</i>\u00a0anyone else. I\u2019m here to do my own work, not finish off yours. So, is there any work for me to do, partner?\u201d</p><p>He clenches his jaw, his mind trying to wrap around the fact that you just gave him attitude, on the first day he may add! He can\u2019t get a word out before he\u2019s interrupted by agent Larson.</p><p>\u201cStyles, Y/L/N, we just got a call from the offices in New York. Conference room, now.\u201d He states, swiftly walking through the conference room doors.</p><p>You both walk in, and you begin to pull a notebook and pen out, and Harry is confused as to why you would, considering the team gets the files anyhow.</p><p>\u201cAgent Horan, begin talking please.\u201d That\u2019s when he sees you writing. He watches as you neatly but quickly jot down Niall\u2019s name, well, \u201cHoran,\u201d and describe what he looks like. He has to admit, it\u2019s something he wishes he did when he joined the team. It would\u2019ve saved him the embarrassment of mixing up people\u2019s names, turning him into a stuttering mess for a whole week.</p><p>\u201cSo, as you\u2019ve heard, the New York offices called and they need our help, there\u2019s been another victim, Sarah Brown, making her the 5th kill in 2 weeks. All of them have been women, in their mid-20s with the same hair color, brunette. All clothing is removed besides their bra and underwear, with no clothing left at the scene.\u201d He announced, handing out the files of the victims that include their pictures of what they looked like on the scene, as well as pulling it up on a big screen.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all been murdered in the same way as well. Practically out in the open with a broken neck and a range of stab wounds, less stabs as more victims were killed. Doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Niall mutters out, looking at the pictures in confusion.</p><p>\u201cHe breaks their neck because it\u2019s quick, and then talks his guilt out by stabbing them repeatedly.\u201d You speculated, squinting at the pictures as well. All heads turn to you. You snap your head up and give a small smile, \u201cHi, Agent Y/N Y/L/N, I\u2019m new here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re sayin\u2019 that the more he kills, the fewer stab wounds we\u2019ll see?\u201d Niall questions you, and you nod, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as he\u2019s getting used t\u2019killing people, the less guilty he feels.\u201d Harry began, \u201cmeaning he\u2019ll be harder to find if all he\u2019s doin\u2019 is snapping necks.\u201d He mutters out, closing the files harshly, you nodding in confirmation.</p><p>\u201cWhich <i>really</i> means that time is running out. We need to stop him before it gets to that point of only snapping necks.\u201d Agent Larson says, the room muttering out their agreements.</p><p>\u201cDo the women have any correlation with each other?\u201d A redheaded girl asks.</p><p>\u201cThey all went to NYU.\u201d And the whole room groans. New York University has over 50,000 students in it and considering that the victims graduated 4-5 years ago, it\u2019s not going to be easy.</p><p>\u201cOkay team,\u201d Larson starts, \u201cWe have lives to save, grab your stuff and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As you\u2019re settling down in the jet, you learn who everyone is. Horan, who goes by Niall or his last name, is the person who gets the information and talks to the press and such. The redhead, Claire, is Liam\u2019s partner. Liam is someone that Harry briefly introduced you to on the tour of the office, a good work friend of his. They basically do what you and Harry do, but they just hold more of the information and lack some of the skill, that\u2019s what Harry tells you anyways.</p><p>That\u2019s where you and Harry come in, with the brains <i>and</i>\u00a0skills. There\u2019s no offense to Claire and Liam, they\u2019re trained and all, it\u2019s just they\u2019d be more hesitant with pulling the trigger than you or Harry.</p><p>Since the victim was found this morning, you and Harry were instructed to go to the scene to scope things out as soon as the jet has landed. You were given a car and address to go, and Harry gets in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>Harry begins driving before he talks, \u201cListen,\u201d he starts, Y/N turning slightly to face him, \u201cI want t\u2019get along. I\u2019m sorry if it sounded like I was just givin\u2019 yeh my scraps, but I jus\u2019 wanted to show yeh what kind of work you\u2019d be gettin\u2019, never wanted yeh to do it for me, love.\u201d</p><p>You gasp, \u201cHarry I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d You apologize, \u201cI\u2019m just used to people wanting to walk all over me because of my dad, I just wanted to be clear about what kind of person I am before you got a chance to do whatever you wanted to me, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>Now Harry feels guilty about making <i>her</i>\u00a0feel bad. \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it! Hi, I\u2019m Harry, the best partner you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d He states cheekily, grinning as he takes his eyes off the road to glance at his partner before bringing his attention back to the road.</p><p>You giggle, \u201cI\u2019m Y/N, a pleasure to be working with you.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>Harry\u2019s talking to a police officer at the crime scene, while you\u2019re walking around the scene. As you\u2019re walking, you notice something on the body. \u201cHarry! C\u2019mere.\u201d You shout, squatting down to get a better look.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He wonders, putting sterile gloves on and squatting with you.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not blood on her cheek.\u201d You observed, pointing to the exact spot you\u2019re talking about without touching it. Harry looks at the cheek intently, nodding as he seems to understand where you\u2019re going with that accusation.</p><p>\u201cLipstick.\u201d He states, you nodding before asking if the police could run some tests in their labs on the lipstick stain for a confirmation.</p><p>He takes his gloves off and reaches for the files of the previous victims, them all having the same \u201cblood\u201d mark on their cheeks. You walk over and peer at the documents, noticing what he just saw.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a he.\u201d He states. You shake your head and smiling. \u201cNope!\u201d You agree, \u201cIt\u2019s a she! Gosh, this just got so much more interesting!\u201d You smile, giddy with excitement.</p><p>Harry laughs at you in amusement,\u00a0\u201cSure it did, Y/N. Nice work.\u201d He smirks, walking back to the car as you smile to yourself. You can already tell that you and Harry are going to make great partners, and it\u2019s only the beginning. But before you think about the future, you need to think about finding the killer on the loose.\u00a0</p></p>",

You\u2019re starting your first day at your new job. It has been your dream job since you were a little girl, following in your father\u2019s footsteps by joining the BAU. He\u2019s always given you tips throughout the years, helping you impress the professors and trainers when it came down to testing.</p><p>Because of your father, your name was known, therefore you were meant to impress always, not wanting to lose the reputation as being one of the best, just like your father was.</p><p>You weren\u2019t forced into this type of work either, which is why it\u2019s also such a big deal to you. You did this because you wanted to find the bad guys and help the good ones, not because of the reputation you brought. Your father never failed to remind you that you did this yourself, that if they only want you for your name, then they didn\u2019t deserve you, and that\u2019s stuck with you ever since you\u2019ve graduated.</p><p>\u201cDetective Y/L/N!\u201d Your name is yelled by your boss as soon as you walk into the building.

You and Harry part and you give your attention back to your captain.</p><p>\u201cHarry has been here for a little over a year now, he\u2019s one of the best agents here. His last partner had some problems, which is why this spot was opened up so quickly. He\u2019ll help you with the in and outs of the force, helping you with what you should be doing and what you shouldn\u2019t. Is that clear?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d You exclaim and nod, him giving you a hard nod himself before walking away. You look at Harry and watch as his smile is cleared off of his face as soon as the captain turns his back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Y/L/N\u2019s daughter?\u201d He questions, you barely get out a \u201cyes\u201d before he cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cYeh understand I\u2019m not gonna treat yeh any different than I would with anyone else, righ\u2019?\u201d You smile, tilting your head to the side with content.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted, Styles. Now, can you show me where my desk is so I can start working please?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>You are not what Harry was expecting. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was expecting, but he wasn\u2019t expecting someone to be so excited over a job like this. The Behavioral Analysis Unit could look exciting when you\u2019re in college and in training, but not when you\u2019re living in the reality of it.</p><p>\u201cThis is your desk.\u201d He says, pointing to a desk that\u2019s in front of his own. \u201c\u2018M over here, so yeh know.

His last partner had some problems, which is why this spot was opened up so quickly. He&rsquo;ll help you with the in and outs of the force, helping you with what you should be doing and what you shouldn&rsquo;t. Is that clear?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; You exclaim and nod, him giving you a hard nod himself before walking away. You look at Harry and watch as his smile is cleared off of his face as soon as the captain turns his back.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Y/L/N&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo; He questions, you barely get out a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; before he cuts you off.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeh understand I&rsquo;m not gonna treat yeh any different than I would with anyone else, righ&rsquo;?&rdquo; You smile, tilting your head to the side with content.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve ever wanted, Styles. Now, can you show me where my desk is so I can start working please?&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>You are not what Harry was expecting. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what he was expecting, but he wasn&rsquo;t expecting someone to be so excited over a job like this. The Behavioral Analysis Unit could look exciting when you&rsquo;re in college and in training, but not when you&rsquo;re living in the reality of it.</p><p>&ldquo;This is your desk.&rdquo; He says, pointing to a desk that&rsquo;s in front of his own. &ldquo;&lsquo;M over here, so yeh know. If yeh need me I&rsquo;m righ&rsquo; here.&rdquo;</p><p>He had just got done giving you the tour of the building. Where the conference room is, where all the computers are, where Agent Larson&rsquo;s office is, and so on.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;Any questions?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there any work for me to do?&rdquo; You inquired, putting your briefcase down on your desk and shrugging your jacket off.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have some work that needs to be finished if yeh-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; You cut him off, startling Harry in the process, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; He questions, not understanding fully why you told him &lsquo;no&rsquo; in the small fraction of time that you&rsquo;ve known him.</p><p>&ldquo;You could treat me like you would anyone else, but I&rsquo;m <i>not</i>&nbsp;anyone else. I&rsquo;m here to do my own work, not finish off yours. So, is there any work for me to do, partner?&rdquo;</p><p>He clenches his jaw, his mind trying to wrap around the fact that you just gave him attitude, on the first day he may add! He can&rsquo;t get a word out before he&rsquo;s interrupted by agent Larson.</p><p>&ldquo;Styles, Y/L/N, we just got a call from the offices in New York. Conference room, now.&rdquo; He states, swiftly walking through the conference room doors.</p><p>You both walk in, and you begin to pull a notebook and pen out, and Harry is confused as to why you would, considering the team gets the files anyhow.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Horan, begin talking please.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when he sees you writing. He watches as you neatly but quickly jot down Niall&rsquo;s name, well, &ldquo;Horan,&rdquo; and describe what he looks like. He has to admit, it&rsquo;s something he wishes he did when he joined the team. It would&rsquo;ve saved him the embarrassment of mixing up people&rsquo;s names, turning him into a stuttering mess for a whole week.</p><p>&ldquo;So, as you&rsquo;ve heard, the New York offices called and they need our help, there&rsquo;s been another victim, Sarah Brown, making her the 5th kill in 2 weeks. All of them have been women, in their mid-20s with the same hair color, brunette. All clothing is removed besides their bra and underwear, with no clothing left at the scene.&rdquo; He announced, handing out the files of the victims that include their pictures of what they looked like on the scene, as well as pulling it up on a big screen.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all been murdered in the same way as well. Practically out in the open with a broken neck and a range of stab wounds, less stabs as more victims were killed. Doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo; Niall mutters out, looking at the pictures in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;He breaks their neck because it&rsquo;s quick, and then talks his guilt out by stabbing them repeatedly.&rdquo; You speculated, squinting at the pictures as well. All heads turn to you. You snap your head up and give a small smile, &ldquo;Hi, Agent Y/N Y/L/N, I&rsquo;m new here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo; that the more he kills, the fewer stab wounds we&rsquo;ll see?&rdquo; Niall questions you, and you nod, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because as he&rsquo;s getting used t&rsquo;killing people, the less guilty he feels.&rdquo; Harry began, &ldquo;meaning he&rsquo;ll be harder to find if all he&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; is snapping necks.&rdquo; He mutters out, closing the files harshly, you nodding in confirmation.</p><p>&ldquo;Which <i>really</i> means that time is running out. We need to stop him before it gets to that point of only snapping necks.&rdquo; Agent Larson says, the room muttering out their agreements.</p><p>&ldquo;Do the women have any correlation with each other?&rdquo; A redheaded girl asks.</p><p>&ldquo;They all went to NYU.&rdquo; And the whole room groans. New York University has over 50,000 students in it and considering that the victims graduated 4-5 years ago, it&rsquo;s not going to be easy.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay team,&rdquo; Larson starts, &ldquo;We have lives to save, grab your stuff and let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>As you&rsquo;re settling down in the jet, you learn who everyone is. Horan, who goes by Niall or his last name, is the person who gets the information and talks to the press and such. The redhead, Claire, is Liam&rsquo;s partner. Liam is someone that Harry briefly introduced you to on the tour of the office, a good work friend of his. They basically do what you and Harry do, but they just hold more of the information and lack some of the skill, that&rsquo;s what Harry tells you anyways.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where you and Harry come in, with the brains <i>and</i>&nbsp;skills. There&rsquo;s no offense to Claire and Liam, they&rsquo;re trained and all, it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;d be more hesitant with pulling the trigger than you or Harry.</p><p>Since the victim was found this morning, you and Harry were instructed to go to the scene to scope things out as soon as the jet has landed. You were given a car and address to go, and Harry gets in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p><p>Harry begins driving before he talks, &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he starts, Y/N turning slightly to face him, &ldquo;I want t&rsquo;get along. I&rsquo;m sorry if it sounded like I was just givin&rsquo; yeh my scraps, but I jus&rsquo; wanted to show yeh what kind of work you&rsquo;d be gettin&rsquo;, never wanted yeh to do it for me, love.&rdquo;</p><p>You gasp, &ldquo;Harry I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; You apologize, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just used to people wanting to walk all over me because of my dad, I just wanted to be clear about what kind of person I am before you got a chance to do whatever you wanted to me, I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Now Harry feels guilty about making <i>her</i>&nbsp;feel bad. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t worry about it! Hi, I&rsquo;m Harry, the best partner you&rsquo;ll ever have.&rdquo; He states cheekily, grinning as he takes his eyes off the road to glance at his partner before bringing his attention back to the road.</p><p>You giggle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N, a pleasure to be working with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s talking to a police officer at the crime scene, while you&rsquo;re walking around the scene. As you&rsquo;re walking, you notice something on the body. &ldquo;Harry! C&rsquo;mere.&rdquo; You shout, squatting down to get a better look.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; He wonders, putting sterile gloves on and squatting with you.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not blood on her cheek.&rdquo; You observed, pointing to the exact spot you&rsquo;re talking about without touching it. Harry looks at the cheek intently, nodding as he seems to understand where you&rsquo;re going with that accusation.</p><p>&ldquo;Lipstick.&rdquo; He states, you nodding before asking if the police could run some tests in their labs on the lipstick stain for a confirmation.</p><p>He takes his gloves off and reaches for the files of the previous victims, them all having the same &ldquo;blood&rdquo; mark on their cheeks. You walk over and peer at the documents, noticing what he just saw.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a he.&rdquo; He states. You shake your head and smiling. &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; You agree, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a she! Gosh, this just got so much more interesting!&rdquo; You smile, giddy with excitement.</p><p>Harry laughs at you in amusement,&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure it did, Y/N. Nice work.&rdquo; He smirks, walking back to the car as you smile to yourself. You can already tell that you and Harry are going to make great partners, and it&rsquo;s only the beginning. But before you think about the future, you need to think about finding the killer on the loose.&nbsp;</p></p>",
