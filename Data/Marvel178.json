Playtime sock? What weird Christmas porn did you find?\u201d Tony\u2019s nose crinkled and he whirled around to look at Bucky with confusion before raising a silencing hand. \u201cOn second thought, please don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Natasha rolled her eyes at Pepper who giggled - a pleased blush rising high on her cheeks.</p><p>Steve pulled a slip of paper from the stocking and peeked at it before passing it to Sam who followed suit.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you get,\u201d Sam whispered, passing the stocking to Bucky and leaning to peek over Steve\u2019s shoulder who pressed his slip of paper to his broad chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bad at secrets,\u201d Steve admonished.</p><p>\u201cGuys, it\u2019s called Secret Santa for a reason,\u201d Pepper chuckled, swatting at Sam\u2019s knees playfully.</p><p>Natasha took the stocking from Bucky and pulled a name, looked at it, then pulled it back and pulled another one.</p><p>\u201cCheater! You\u2019re cheating,\u201d Wanda called out, pointing at her friend and laughing.</p><p>Natasha stuck her tongue out at Wanda and winked. \u201cI pulled my own name, otrod\u2019ye.\u201d</p><p>Wanda gasped and snatched the stocking from the redhead, pouting as she shook the stocking and pulled a name from the bottom, examined it and then handed it to Vision.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a secret Santa?\u201d Vision asked carefully, peeking into the mouth of the stocking before reaching it and pulling out his own slip.</p><p>\u201cYou just have to get a gift for the person on your slip. It takes away the pressure of having to get something for everyone, we\u2019re a big family. But you don\u2019t tell anyone who you got so then when you open your gift you guess who gave it to you,\u201d Pepper explained simply, rubbing her hands together with an excited smile.</p><p>Bruce took a slip of paper and finished the loop with the Asgardians behind him.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably put a dollar limit on gifts,\u201d Bruce said softly casting his eyes over to Tony.</p><p>Tony scoffed as the rest of the group mumbled in agreement.</p><p>\u201cWe could always do a white elephant,\u201d Pepper suggested and a bunch of confused gazes swung her way. Pepper blinked in surprise for a moment and shrugged. \u201cYou know silly gifts. Gifts that aren\u2019t exactly practical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that time Bucky thought a good birthday present was a paperclip wrapped in two rolls of duct tape?\u201d Sam muttered and Bucky smiled fondly at the memory.</p><p>\u201cI never said it was a good present,\u201d Bucky quipped and Steve frowned at his best friend, mouthing \u2018behave\u2019 behind Sam\u2019s back which caused Bucky to roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou could have at least put like a gift card or something in there!\u201d Sam accused.</p><p>\u201cI used up the dollar limit we were given that time on duct tape,\u201d Bucky shrugged innocently, wincing as Steve punched him on the shoulder.</p><p>The stocking finally made it\u2019s way back to Pepper through all the chattering and petty quarreling. Pepper looked over this little haphazard family that was formed through blood and tears and smiled to herself. They weren\u2019t a traditional family, but they were hers.</p><!-- more --><p>~*~</p><p>They had decided to unwrap presents on Christmas Eve, Pepper had organized for them all to go to the Children\u2019s Hospital on Christmas morning to visit the kids and bring presents so they chose to have the evening to themselves. There hadn\u2019t been a mission in a while so everyone was in good spirits and happy to all just be with each other.</p><p>Bucky sat between Sam and Steve, grumbling murderously under his breath at the itchy ugly sweater that Steve and Sam had forced him into. Wanda and Natasha were whispering mischievously as Wanda used her magic to float a mistletoe above the heads of random duos, Clint and Tony being the most amusing one so far because neither man was the type to back down from any sort of situation. In the end, Pepper had to pull her husband back into her arms and threaten Clint with castration if he kept getting hot and heavy on her man. Thor and Loki had returned from some sort of adventure and they were speaking in hushed voices with Bruce in the far corner, looking serious, but broke apart with smiles when Rhodes beckoned them over to join the festivities.</p><p>The small shoddily wrapped pile of presents sat on the coffee table in the middle of them all.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to play Santa\u2019s elf?\u201d Pepper asked the group and was met with a handful of confused faces.</p><p>\u201cOh! I can!\u201d Wanda squealed excitedly and red magic enveloped the presents, they floated out and found the laps of their receivers.</p><p>They went around in a circle, starting with Steve who unwrapped a little book the size of a breast pocket titled \u2018The C.I.A. Manual of Treachery and Deception\u2019. Steve raised one blond eyebrow before looking around the circle at the group, his baby blue eyes landing on Natasha. \u201cSeriously, I could be a spy if I wanted to,\u201d Steve moaned and Natasha laughed, clutching her sides in glee.</p><p>\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t. So study up.\u201d Natasha grinned wickedly.</p><p>Bucky went next, unwrapping a jug of motor oil, a large bottle of KY Jelly, and a car wax kit. Bucky blinked at the items in the box on his lap, Steve looked hesitantly between the gifts in his best friend\u2019s lap to his face waiting for the potential meltdown, but Bucky simply tipped his head back and let out the most genuine laugh anyone had heard from the man in a long time. It took a minute for Bucky to calm down and wipe away the tears that were streaking down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWas this you?\u201d Bucky asked Sam, elbowing the man in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wish it had been,\u201d Sam said picking up the large bottle of lube in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what the lube is for, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is for both the Sergeant and the Captain,\u201d Vision piped up looking stoically between the two men.</p><p>There was a pregnant pause before the entire room burst out into fits of hysterical laughter, Steve and Bucky looking positively pink in the face with embarrassment.</p><p>Eventually, Sam unwrapped his present, guessing correctly that the old Walkman with Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Troubleman\u2019 cassette in it was from Steve. Thor unwrapped a little snake Beanie Baby and after deciding that Loki would have given him a real snake correctly guessed Bruce as the gift giver. Rhodes got Loki an old Swiss Army knife that had all the other attachments replaced so that it was just little daggers no matter what he pulled out. Loki gave Natasha an actual Black Widow spider and Thor gave Tony a screwdriver, but when Tony went to pick it up it gave him a sharp zap of electricity. Thor laughed harder than any of them. Clint gave Rhodes a pair of roller skates and earned a new pair of headphones from Tony. Clint and Rhodes spent the rest of the night pretending to enjoy the gifts that opposed their disabilities. Wanda unwrapped a little charm bracelet that had both a red glass stone that reflected the light and on the opposite a silver heart charm, with tear-filled eyes she looked up at Pepper questioningly and when Pepper shook her head she looked around the circle before landing on Sam.</p><p>\u201cI was never good at giving white elephant gifts,\u201d Sam murmured and let out an \u2018oof\u2019 when the small girl tackled him deeper into the couch in a tight hug. Pepper had given Bruce a series of meditation CDs with the Blu-Ray of Wreck-It Ralph tucked in the middle, which he thanked her for softly.</p><p>When it was Peppers turn she carefully tore away the wrapping because out of all of the presents it looked to have been wrapped with care and had a large white and gold glitter bow on top. Under the wrapping was a small garment box and she smiled wryly imagining what gaudy outfit Wanda had probably picked for her. Wanda was always teasing Pepper on how pristine and uptight she always looked, knowing that Pepper was anything but. What she didn\u2019t expect when she pulled away the tissue paper was a little white newborn sized onesie that said: \u201cMy Mom Is A Superhero\u201d on it in black writing.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s hand fluttered to her tummy as she looked up with watery eyes at Wanda. \u201cDid you read my mind?\u201d Pepper whispered, her voice cracking.</p><p>Wanda looked confused, her brows pinching. \u201cI didn\u2019t have you,\u201d Wanda answered, shaking her head just as Vision opened his brand new spice wrack with all the spices in their jars labeled.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s gaze swam to Bucky, who was the only one left. His cheeks a soft blush and he shrugged his shoulders slightly, his eyes casting downwards.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asked and Bucky scoffed, rolling his ice blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a spy, doll. I knew weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d Tony asked, bouncing over to peek over the couch at the present on Pepper\u2019s lap that she still hadn\u2019t shown the group. \u201cWait. What? Is this\u2026is this real? Pepper? Honey? Is this real?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes got round and he looked between Pepper and Tony with horror. \u201cOh god, Pep, you hadn\u2019t told him yet?\u201d Bucky asked sounding chagrin.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t told anyone,\u201d Pepper answered before holding up the onesie to the group. The group blinked, jaws dropping before everyone erupted into cheers and congratulations. Everyone jumped to their feet to give hugs and pull out the alcohol in celebration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a dad! Holy fuck\u2026I need to sit down. I\u2019m going to be a dad,\u201d Tony started cheering before growing a little faint.</p><p>Pepper stood and crossed the seating area to Bucky who stood to greet her. Slowly she wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him tightly. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered into his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry, I ruined you getting to tell him,\u201d Bucky apologized, gently hugging the petite woman back.</p><p>She leaned back and shook her head. \u201cNo, Bucky, this was absolutely perfect.\u201d</p>",

There hadn\u2019t been a mission in a while so everyone was in good spirits and happy to all just be with each other.</p><p>Bucky sat between Sam and Steve, grumbling murderously under his breath at the itchy ugly sweater that Steve and Sam had forced him into. Wanda and Natasha were whispering mischievously as Wanda used her magic to float a mistletoe above the heads of random duos, Clint and Tony being the most amusing one so far because neither man was the type to back down from any sort of situation. In the end, Pepper had to pull her husband back into her arms and threaten Clint with castration if he kept getting hot and heavy on her man. Thor and Loki had returned from some sort of adventure and they were speaking in hushed voices with Bruce in the far corner, looking serious, but broke apart with smiles when Rhodes beckoned them over to join the festivities.</p><p>The small shoddily wrapped pile of presents sat on the coffee table in the middle of them all.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to play Santa\u2019s elf?\u201d Pepper asked the group and was met with a handful of confused faces.</p><p>\u201cOh! I can!\u201d Wanda squealed excitedly and red magic enveloped the presents, they floated out and found the laps of their receivers.</p><p>They went around in a circle, starting with Steve who unwrapped a little book the size of a breast pocket titled \u2018The C.I.A. Manual of Treachery and Deception\u2019. Steve raised one blond eyebrow before looking around the circle at the group, his baby blue eyes landing on Natasha. \u201cSeriously, I could be a spy if I wanted to,\u201d Steve moaned and Natasha laughed, clutching her sides in glee.</p><p>\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t. So study up.\u201d Natasha grinned wickedly.</p><p>Bucky went next, unwrapping a jug of motor oil, a large bottle of KY Jelly, and a car wax kit. Bucky blinked at the items in the box on his lap, Steve looked hesitantly between the gifts in his best friend\u2019s lap to his face waiting for the potential meltdown, but Bucky simply tipped his head back and let out the most genuine laugh anyone had heard from the man in a long time. It took a minute for Bucky to calm down and wipe away the tears that were streaking down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWas this you?\u201d Bucky asked Sam, elbowing the man in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wish it had been,\u201d Sam said picking up the large bottle of lube in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what the lube is for, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is for both the Sergeant and the Captain,\u201d Vision piped up looking stoically between the two men.</p><p>There was a pregnant pause before the entire room burst out into fits of hysterical laughter, Steve and Bucky looking positively pink in the face with embarrassment.</p><p>Eventually, Sam unwrapped his present, guessing correctly that the old Walkman with Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Troubleman\u2019 cassette in it was from Steve. Thor unwrapped a little snake Beanie Baby and after deciding that Loki would have given him a real snake correctly guessed Bruce as the gift giver. Rhodes got Loki an old Swiss Army knife that had all the other attachments replaced so that it was just little daggers no matter what he pulled out. Loki gave Natasha an actual Black Widow spider and Thor gave Tony a screwdriver, but when Tony went to pick it up it gave him a sharp zap of electricity. Thor laughed harder than any of them. Clint gave Rhodes a pair of roller skates and earned a new pair of headphones from Tony. Clint and Rhodes spent the rest of the night pretending to enjoy the gifts that opposed their disabilities. Wanda unwrapped a little charm bracelet that had both a red glass stone that reflected the light and on the opposite a silver heart charm, with tear-filled eyes she looked up at Pepper questioningly and when Pepper shook her head she looked around the circle before landing on Sam.</p><p>\u201cI was never good at giving white elephant gifts,\u201d Sam murmured and let out an \u2018oof\u2019 when the small girl tackled him deeper into the couch in a tight hug. Pepper had given Bruce a series of meditation CDs with the Blu-Ray of Wreck-It Ralph tucked in the middle, which he thanked her for softly.</p><p>When it was Peppers turn she carefully tore away the wrapping because out of all of the presents it looked to have been wrapped with care and had a large white and gold glitter bow on top. Under the wrapping was a small garment box and she smiled wryly imagining what gaudy outfit Wanda had probably picked for her. Wanda was always teasing Pepper on how pristine and uptight she always looked, knowing that Pepper was anything but. What she didn\u2019t expect when she pulled away the tissue paper was a little white newborn sized onesie that said: \u201cMy Mom Is A Superhero\u201d on it in black writing.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s hand fluttered to her tummy as she looked up with watery eyes at Wanda. \u201cDid you read my mind?\u201d Pepper whispered, her voice cracking.</p><p>Wanda looked confused, her brows pinching. \u201cI didn\u2019t have you,\u201d Wanda answered, shaking her head just as Vision opened his brand new spice wrack with all the spices in their jars labeled.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s gaze swam to Bucky, who was the only one left. His cheeks a soft blush and he shrugged his shoulders slightly, his eyes casting downwards.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asked and Bucky scoffed, rolling his ice blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a spy, doll. I knew weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d Tony asked, bouncing over to peek over the couch at the present on Pepper\u2019s lap that she still hadn\u2019t shown the group. \u201cWait. What? Is this\u2026is this real? Pepper? Honey? Is this real?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes got round and he looked between Pepper and Tony with horror. \u201cOh god, Pep, you hadn\u2019t told him yet?\u201d Bucky asked sounding chagrin.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t told anyone,\u201d Pepper answered before holding up the onesie to the group. The group blinked, jaws dropping before everyone erupted into cheers and congratulations. Everyone jumped to their feet to give hugs and pull out the alcohol in celebration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a dad! Holy fuck\u2026I need to sit down. I\u2019m going to be a dad,\u201d Tony started cheering before growing a little faint.</p><p>Pepper stood and crossed the seating area to Bucky who stood to greet her. Slowly she wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him tightly. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered into his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry, I ruined you getting to tell him,\u201d Bucky apologized, gently hugging the petite woman back.</p><p>She leaned back and shook her head. \u201cNo, Bucky, this was absolutely perfect.\u201d</p>",

Pepper had given Bruce a series of meditation CDs with the Blu-Ray of Wreck-It Ralph tucked in the middle, which he thanked her for softly.</p><p>When it was Peppers turn she carefully tore away the wrapping because out of all of the presents it looked to have been wrapped with care and had a large white and gold glitter bow on top. Under the wrapping was a small garment box and she smiled wryly imagining what gaudy outfit Wanda had probably picked for her. Wanda was always teasing Pepper on how pristine and uptight she always looked, knowing that Pepper was anything but.

His cheeks a soft blush and he shrugged his shoulders slightly, his eyes casting downwards.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asked and Bucky scoffed, rolling his ice blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a spy, doll.

Is this\u2026is this real? Pepper? Honey? Is this real?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes got round and he looked between Pepper and Tony with horror. \u201cOh god, Pep, you hadn\u2019t told him yet?\u201d Bucky asked sounding chagrin.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t told anyone,\u201d Pepper answered before holding up the onesie to the group.

I\u2019m going to be a dad,\u201d Tony started cheering before growing a little faint.</p><p>Pepper stood and crossed the seating area to Bucky who stood to greet her.

It takes away the pressure of having to get something for everyone, we&rsquo;re a big family. But you don&rsquo;t tell anyone who you got so then when you open your gift you guess who gave it to you,&rdquo; Pepper explained simply, rubbing her hands together with an excited smile.</p><p>Bruce took a slip of paper and finished the loop with the Asgardians behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;We should probably put a dollar limit on gifts,&rdquo; Bruce said softly casting his eyes over to Tony.</p><p>Tony scoffed as the rest of the group mumbled in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;We could always do a white elephant,&rdquo; Pepper suggested and a bunch of confused gazes swung her way. Pepper blinked in surprise for a moment and shrugged. &ldquo;You know silly gifts. Gifts that aren&rsquo;t exactly practical.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like that time Bucky thought a good birthday present was a paperclip wrapped in two rolls of duct tape?&rdquo; Sam muttered and Bucky smiled fondly at the memory.</p><p>&ldquo;I never said it was a good present,&rdquo; Bucky quipped and Steve frowned at his best friend, mouthing &lsquo;behave&rsquo; behind Sam&rsquo;s back which caused Bucky to roll his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You could have at least put like a gift card or something in there!&rdquo; Sam accused.</p><p>&ldquo;I used up the dollar limit we were given that time on duct tape,&rdquo; Bucky shrugged innocently, wincing as Steve punched him on the shoulder.</p><p>The stocking finally made it&rsquo;s way back to Pepper through all the chattering and petty quarreling. Pepper looked over this little haphazard family that was formed through blood and tears and smiled to herself. They weren&rsquo;t a traditional family, but they were hers.</p><p>~*~</p><p>They had decided to unwrap presents on Christmas Eve, Pepper had organized for them all to go to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital on Christmas morning to visit the kids and bring presents so they chose to have the evening to themselves. There hadn&rsquo;t been a mission in a while so everyone was in good spirits and happy to all just be with each other.</p><p>Bucky sat between Sam and Steve, grumbling murderously under his breath at the itchy ugly sweater that Steve and Sam had forced him into. Wanda and Natasha were whispering mischievously as Wanda used her magic to float a mistletoe above the heads of random duos, Clint and Tony being the most amusing one so far because neither man was the type to back down from any sort of situation. In the end, Pepper had to pull her husband back into her arms and threaten Clint with castration if he kept getting hot and heavy on her man. Thor and Loki had returned from some sort of adventure and they were speaking in hushed voices with Bruce in the far corner, looking serious, but broke apart with smiles when Rhodes beckoned them over to join the festivities.</p><p>The small shoddily wrapped pile of presents sat on the coffee table in the middle of them all.</p><p>&ldquo;Who wants to play Santa&rsquo;s elf?&rdquo; Pepper asked the group and was met with a handful of confused faces.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! I can!&rdquo; Wanda squealed excitedly and red magic enveloped the presents, they floated out and found the laps of their receivers.</p><p>They went around in a circle, starting with Steve who unwrapped a little book the size of a breast pocket titled &lsquo;The C.I.A. Manual of Treachery and Deception&rsquo;. Steve raised one blond eyebrow before looking around the circle at the group, his baby blue eyes landing on Natasha. &ldquo;Seriously, I could be a spy if I wanted to,&rdquo; Steve moaned and Natasha laughed, clutching her sides in glee.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you couldn&rsquo;t. So study up.&rdquo; Natasha grinned wickedly.</p><p>Bucky went next, unwrapping a jug of motor oil, a large bottle of KY Jelly, and a car wax kit. Bucky blinked at the items in the box on his lap, Steve looked hesitantly between the gifts in his best friend&rsquo;s lap to his face waiting for the potential meltdown, but Bucky simply tipped his head back and let out the most genuine laugh anyone had heard from the man in a long time. It took a minute for Bucky to calm down and wipe away the tears that were streaking down his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Was this you?&rdquo; Bucky asked Sam, elbowing the man in the ribs.</p><p>&ldquo;No, but I wish it had been,&rdquo; Sam said picking up the large bottle of lube in his hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what the lube is for, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is for both the Sergeant and the Captain,&rdquo; Vision piped up looking stoically between the two men.</p><p>There was a pregnant pause before the entire room burst out into fits of hysterical laughter, Steve and Bucky looking positively pink in the face with embarrassment.</p><p>Eventually, Sam unwrapped his present, guessing correctly that the old Walkman with Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s &lsquo;Troubleman&rsquo; cassette in it was from Steve. Thor unwrapped a little snake Beanie Baby and after deciding that Loki would have given him a real snake correctly guessed Bruce as the gift giver. Rhodes got Loki an old Swiss Army knife that had all the other attachments replaced so that it was just little daggers no matter what he pulled out. Loki gave Natasha an actual Black Widow spider and Thor gave Tony a screwdriver, but when Tony went to pick it up it gave him a sharp zap of electricity. Thor laughed harder than any of them. Clint gave Rhodes a pair of roller skates and earned a new pair of headphones from Tony. Clint and Rhodes spent the rest of the night pretending to enjoy the gifts that opposed their disabilities. Wanda unwrapped a little charm bracelet that had both a red glass stone that reflected the light and on the opposite a silver heart charm, with tear-filled eyes she looked up at Pepper questioningly and when Pepper shook her head she looked around the circle before landing on Sam.</p><p>&ldquo;I was never good at giving white elephant gifts,&rdquo; Sam murmured and let out an &lsquo;oof&rsquo; when the small girl tackled him deeper into the couch in a tight hug.

What if they think i&rsquo;m weird?&rdquo;, you asked yourself.</p><p>Lucky your father was right behind you, dressed in his&nbsp;&lsquo;uniform&rsquo; , unfortunately you weren&rsquo;t convincing enough to make him change, he just wasn&rsquo;t having it. He wrapped one of his muscular arms around you, squeezing you gently,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be just fine.I think everyone will wanna know Captain America&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;, He chucked, but you quickly countered,&rdquo;You do know fake friends are a thing,right?&rdquo;, You sighed, rolling your eyes at the old man.</p><p>&ldquo;You do know you&rsquo;re basically a human lie detector, right?&rdquo;, he countered back, mocking your annoyed tone of voice. A few seconds later the blaring sound of the school bell rung through out the entire school, teens soon rushing to class, you began walking off in an effort to escape your father until he caught your arm yanking you back, almost pulling you arm out of it&rsquo;s socket,almost.&rdquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t missy,i&rsquo;ll be walking you to your class and i&rsquo;m not leaving until I see sit in that desk of yours.&rdquo;, he said , very determined<i>, very&nbsp;</i>determined.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh boy.&rdquo;, you sighed&nbsp;for what felt like that millionth time today.<br /></p><p>You quickly knocked on the classroom door, the teacher looking angrily at you for interrupting his class until he did a double take his jaw dropping instantly, the class soon noticing his awe-struck gaze. The front row of the class leaning against their desks , wanting to see who finally shut up the teacher. A red-headed girl quickly squealed out in a really, really annoying voice,&nbsp;&ldquo;OMG! It&rsquo;s Captain Fucking America!&rdquo;, you sighed.&nbsp;</p><p>Your Dad smiled anyway, walking through the door, everyone&rsquo;s intake of air as loud as the cars passing by outside, you just rolled your eyes as your father took in all the attention.&nbsp;&ldquo;Alrighty everyone this is my daughter, (Y/N), and she will be spending time with you, please be nice, she&rsquo;s very shy.&rdquo;, he explained, suddenly you thanked the God&rsquo;s that he was there to explain everything. You smiled softly and whispered,&rdquo;Thanks Dad.&rdquo;, he smiled slighty , hearing you.&nbsp;</p><p>Not wanting to annoy you any further, instead of hugging you, he opted for a fist pump. You giggle softly as his mouthed ,&nbsp;&lsquo;I love you.&rsquo; as he walked out.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as he left, smiling to yourself you walked to the back of the class , sitting in the last open desk (how convinient), next to a boy.&nbsp; A very cute boy indeed , sneaking side glances at him you first noticed the mop of brown of hair of his head, locking very silky, your fingers itching to pull through it. Then you noticed his chocolate brown eyes , focused on the teacher, your mind feeling jealous,wanting that kind of attention on you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone , let&rsquo;s continue shall we? I assume you will be getting the work that you missed out on from one of the classmates?&rdquo;, he said catching everyone&rsquo;s attention again,looking at you he nodded expectantly, you nodded back. Opening your book you started taking down notes, you felt someone looking at you,&nbsp; you caught the cute guy looking at you.&nbsp;</p><p>You smiled back ,waving slightly, he smiled to looking down at his book, blushing,&rsquo;Cute.&rsquo;, you thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon the class ended, everyone moving along to the cafeteria, you didn&rsquo;t need the lunch being served, so you just walked around, spotting the cute boy and his friend. You weaved through the tables to get to their table, they were sitting alone, it was odd considering the fact that he was cute. Why wasn&rsquo;t he popular?&rsquo;Eh, maybe I just don&rsquo;t understand school logic&rsquo;, you thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Sitting infront of him you smiled, he seemed surprised, like you weren&rsquo;t supposed to be there.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, my name is (Y/N) Rogers.&rdquo;,you said, almost getting lost in his chocolate brown eyes.&rdquo;M-my n-n-ame is Peter and this is Ned.&rdquo;, he said, introducing his friend and himself.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is your lunch?&rdquo; , asked Ned, noticing the absence of your tray, you blushed, pulling the lunch bag out of your back pack,&nbsp;&ldquo;My dad didn&rsquo;t want me eating greasy cafeteria food, he made it this morning, want some?&rdquo; , you asked .&rdquo;So you&rsquo;re saying that the Captian America made your lunch?&rdquo; , Ned asked, you nodded, muching on some cut fruit.</p><p>He looked at you in awe,&rdquo;So cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://samwinchesterssexyface.tumblr.com/post/183634596164/our-saviour-has-come-3\">Part 3</a></p><p><i>AN</i></p><p><i>I apologise for any gramatical errors, if you have any ideas for the next chapter please do send me any requests.
