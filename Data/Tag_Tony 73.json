This is a leash\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d, Tony replied, firmly, snatching the offending item out of his husbands hands, \u201cIt\u2019s a harness, and this isn\u2019t a discussion\u201d. Of course that didn\u2019t impress Stev, only Captain America could pack a duffel bag disapprovingly. \u201cI don\u2019t care Steve, you aren\u2019t with him everyday, I can\u2019t take him anywhere without him bolting the second I look away\u201d. Which wasn\u2019t an exaggeration either, they\u2019d been to the zoo the week before and one of the guides had stopped them to ask him a question and before he knew it Peter had let go of his hand and was off like a shot. Even trying to take him to the mall was a nightmare. Once he and steve had been arguing over which pair of shoes to buy him and he\u2019d just tottered off from where he\u2019d been sitting. If it wasn\u2019t for the store assistant spotting him at the last minute he would\u2019ve wandered out into the street. </p><p>He was just curious, or tactile might have been a better word, it was like he had a need to touch whatever caught his eye, and Tony had tried literally everything else. Keeping him in his stroller was no use, he was four and change, but was a smart kid who\u2019d long figured out how to get himself loose. He\u2019d tried carrying him around, but Tony\u2019s body wasn\u2019t exactly in tip top shape after being thrown around in a metal can for the better part of a decade. Not to mention that little Peter loved the arc reactor (and anything bright and shiny really), it hadn\u2019t been so much of a problem when he\u2019d been smaller, it was cute even, but the prodding and poking was starting to get painful and he\u2019d even managed to unclip it from its socket once. Which had been terrifying, it was a good job Steve had been with him because he\u2019d pretty much thrown the kid into his arms so he could plug the reactor back in place.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not around as much as you are, but a leash seems a little extreme\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHarness, not leash, look it\u2019s even got a little dog backpack\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never gonna learn to control himself if we have him tethered to our side\u201d. Tony was starting to get annoyed. After they\u2019d adopted Peter he\u2019d gone into semi-retirement, he still tagged in when the team needed him, but after Ultron he wasn\u2019t in the best of places to be running around with the Avengers anyway. He was still designing tech for SI, but apart from the odd meeting or press event he mostly worked from home. Steve on the other hand was still very much an Avenger, and Tony had never, and would never, ask him to give that up, but to say it hadn\u2019t led to there being somewhat of an imbalance in how much time each of them spent with their son would be a flat out lie. </p><p>\u201cHow the hell would you know\u201d, he muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Tony immediately regretted letting his inner monologue run free, but what else was new, \u201cI said, how the hell would you know? Seriously, I mean when was the last time you actually spent time with him outside the tower without me being there\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t fair\u201d, he protested, knowing exactly what Tony was getting at \u201cYou never asked me to quit\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not asking you to, I\u2019m asking you to trust that I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m one person Steve, I can\u2019t watch him every second of every day, and what if something happens to him? We\u2019re not exactly the safest people to have as parents\u201d.</p><p>Steve sighed, \u201cSo that\u2019s what this is about? You\u2019re worried that something\u2019s gonna happen to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a four year old! He can\u2019t exactly defend himself, all it takes is a minute for him to wander off and not come back and god knows what could happen to him\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d, said Steve, pulling him into a hug, tucking his head underneath his chin, \u201cWe\u2019ll use the lea-harness\u201d he corrected himself, \u201cIf it makes you feel safer\u201d.</p><p>\u201cDaddies?\u201d the little voice was followed by the tiny pitter patter of feet along the towers hardwood floors, and Tony realised their bedroom door had been open the entire time, he held his little arms out for Steve to pick him up, \u201cWere you fighting?\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach clenched, he\u2019d spent his entire childhood overhearing screaming matches between his parents, \u201cNo sweetie\u201d, he said, \u201cWell maybe a little bit, but it\u2019s all better now, do you want Daddy to carry you to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving tomorrow?\u201d asked Peter. The Avengers had been called to some situation in South America, apparently an offshoot of Hydra was trying to terrorise the local population, hence the duffel bag.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll be back as soon as possible\u201d, Steve promised. As Peter had gotten older he\u2019d started to ask questions about why Steve disappeared from time to time, at first they had just said he was going away for work, but that hadn\u2019t placated the kid for long, and they knew lying would only mean having to backtrack later on. \u201cAnd Daddy\u2019s going to take you to see Auntie Pepper whilst I\u2019m gone\u201d.</p><p>\u201cReally!\u201d he said, looking over at Tony.</p><p>\u201cSure kiddo, but let&rsquo;s not get too excited, we\u2019ve gotta go to bed if we want to be ready to get on the plane tomorrow\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d, he mumbled, snuggling further into Steve\u2019s side as he was carried back to his bedroom. </p><p>The trip to California was less about seeing Pepper and more about keeping Peter distracted whilst Steve was away, and if he was being honest, keeping himself distracted. It was easier not to worry when he\u2019d \u00a0been there with him, had known everything he&rsquo;d known, which wasn\u2019t so much the case when he was a thousand miles away. It was a little tradition they had, whenever Steve was away, Peter and Tony would do something fun together. Which normally meant crowded places filled with a million hazards that would be dangerous for a regular kid, hence the need for the harness. Especially in California, which somewhat unfortunately, Peter had started to associate with Disneyland, in fact Tony wasn\u2019t sure if the kid realised that \u2018California\u2019 and \u2018Disneyland\u2019 didn\u2019t mean the same thing. Peter had turned his nose up at the harness at first, and Tony wasn\u2019t about to force him to wear it, but once he\u2019d seen the dog backpack he\u2019d completely changed his tune and Tony was actually a little worried he wouldn\u2019t be able to get him out of it. He also really hoped that he wasn\u2019t going to start asking for a dog because there was no way Steve would be able to say no to him. \u00a0</p><p>They\u2019d got a few sideways glances as they were walking around the park, that mostly turned into embarrassment once they realised who\u2019s parenting they were judging. But between the harness, and the hoards of security that were (discreetly) accompanying them, it was the calmest Tony had felt out alone with Peter in months. </p><p>\u201cDaddy\u201d, Peter said, his lip pouting outward a little bit, he\u2019d been starting to trail behind him for about half an hour, and his little legs could only go so far. </p><p>\u201cYou getting tired bud?\u201d asked Tony, \u201cYou want me to carry you for a little while?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYes please\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d, he said, hoisting the growing child into his arms, \u201cBut only till we go get something to eat, Daddy isn\u2019t getting any younger, and what are we absolutely not allowed to do when Daddy\u2019s carrying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay with the light\u201d, Peter said, somewhat glumly, his lip starting to pout again. He had special blackout shirts that he wore when they were going somewhere fancy, but they were tight, all black and not exactly breathable, and it was Springtime in Southern California so that was definitely not happening.</p><p>\u201cUhh uh, don\u2019t give me that face, it\u2019s dangerous to play with the light, if it falls out then Daddy could get hurt, and you don\u2019t want Daddy to get hurt do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d, he said, wrapping his arms around Tony\u2019s neck. Once Peter was settled and not playing with the arc reactor he went to take him for some dinner, Tony knew he wouldn\u2019t last much longer, they\u2019d been walking around all day and he must\u2019ve been exhausted. He perked up a bit after they\u2019d eaten, but even so they made their way back to the park entrance once they were done. </p><p>Of course the next day twitter was full of pictures of them wandering around the park together, harness on full display, which apparently set off a few mommy bloggers who weren\u2019t impressed with the fact Tony Stark was leading his child around on a leash, which in turn sent a cascade of people rushing to his defense. Tony found the whole thing hilarious, arguing to Pepper (who wasn\u2019t so amused) that on the whole it was about the purest scandal he\u2019d ever been involved in. Although Steve was pretty confused as to why the first thing he was asked by the press when he got back was his opinion on mommy bloggers.</p>",

This is a leash\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d, Tony replied, firmly, snatching the offending item out of his husbands hands, \u201cIt\u2019s a harness, and this isn\u2019t a discussion\u201d. Of course that didn\u2019t impress Stev, only Captain America could pack a duffel bag disapprovingly. \u201cI don\u2019t care Steve, you aren\u2019t with him everyday, I can\u2019t take him anywhere without him bolting the second I look away\u201d. Which wasn\u2019t an exaggeration either, they\u2019d been to the zoo the week before and one of the guides had stopped them to ask him a question and before he knew it Peter had let go of his hand and was off like a shot. Even trying to take him to the mall was a nightmare. Once he and steve had been arguing over which pair of shoes to buy him and he\u2019d just tottered off from where he\u2019d been sitting. If it wasn\u2019t for the store assistant spotting him at the last minute he would\u2019ve wandered out into the street. </p><p>He was just curious, or tactile might have been a better word, it was like he had a need to touch whatever caught his eye, and Tony had tried literally everything else. Keeping him in his stroller was no use, he was four and change, but was a smart kid who\u2019d long figured out how to get himself loose. He\u2019d tried carrying him around, but Tony\u2019s body wasn\u2019t exactly in tip top shape after being thrown around in a metal can for the better part of a decade. Not to mention that little Peter loved the arc reactor (and anything bright and shiny really), it hadn\u2019t been so much of a problem when he\u2019d been smaller, it was cute even, but the prodding and poking was starting to get painful and he\u2019d even managed to unclip it from its socket once. Which had been terrifying, it was a good job Steve had been with him because he\u2019d pretty much thrown the kid into his arms so he could plug the reactor back in place.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not around as much as you are, but a leash seems a little extreme\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHarness, not leash, look it\u2019s even got a little dog backpack\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never gonna learn to control himself if we have him tethered to our side\u201d. Tony was starting to get annoyed. After they\u2019d adopted Peter he\u2019d gone into semi-retirement, he still tagged in when the team needed him, but after Ultron he wasn\u2019t in the best of places to be running around with the Avengers anyway. He was still designing tech for SI, but apart from the odd meeting or press event he mostly worked from home. Steve on the other hand was still very much an Avenger, and Tony had never, and would never, ask him to give that up, but to say it hadn\u2019t led to there being somewhat of an imbalance in how much time each of them spent with their son would be a flat out lie. </p><p>\u201cHow the hell would you know\u201d, he muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Tony immediately regretted letting his inner monologue run free, but what else was new, \u201cI said, how the hell would you know? Seriously, I mean when was the last time you actually spent time with him outside the tower without me being there\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t fair\u201d, he protested, knowing exactly what Tony was getting at \u201cYou never asked me to quit\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not asking you to, I\u2019m asking you to trust that I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m one person Steve, I can\u2019t watch him every second of every day, and what if something happens to him? We\u2019re not exactly the safest people to have as parents\u201d.</p><p>Steve sighed, \u201cSo that\u2019s what this is about? You\u2019re worried that something\u2019s gonna happen to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a four year old! He can\u2019t exactly defend himself, all it takes is a minute for him to wander off and not come back and god knows what could happen to him\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d, said Steve, pulling him into a hug, tucking his head underneath his chin, \u201cWe\u2019ll use the lea-harness\u201d he corrected himself, \u201cIf it makes you feel safer\u201d.</p><p>\u201cDaddies?\u201d the little voice was followed by the tiny pitter patter of feet along the towers hardwood floors, and Tony realised their bedroom door had been open the entire time, he held his little arms out for Steve to pick him up, \u201cWere you fighting?\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach clenched, he\u2019d spent his entire childhood overhearing screaming matches between his parents, \u201cNo sweetie\u201d, he said, \u201cWell maybe a little bit, but it\u2019s all better now, do you want Daddy to carry you to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving tomorrow?\u201d asked Peter. The Avengers had been called to some situation in South America, apparently an offshoot of Hydra was trying to terrorise the local population, hence the duffel bag.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll be back as soon as possible\u201d, Steve promised. As Peter had gotten older he\u2019d started to ask questions about why Steve disappeared from time to time, at first they had just said he was going away for work, but that hadn\u2019t placated the kid for long, and they knew lying would only mean having to backtrack later on. \u201cAnd Daddy\u2019s going to take you to see Auntie Pepper whilst I\u2019m gone\u201d.</p><p>\u201cReally!\u201d he said, looking over at Tony.</p><p>\u201cSure kiddo, but let\u2019s not get too excited, we\u2019ve gotta go to bed if we want to be ready to get on the plane tomorrow\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d, he mumbled, snuggling further into Steve\u2019s side as he was carried back to his bedroom. </p><p>The trip to California was less about seeing Pepper and more about keeping Peter distracted whilst Steve was away, and if he was being honest, keeping himself distracted. It was easier not to worry when he\u2019d \u00a0been there with him, had known everything he\u2019d known, which wasn\u2019t so much the case when he was a thousand miles away. It was a little tradition they had, whenever Steve was away, Peter and Tony would do something fun together. Which normally meant crowded places filled with a million hazards that would be dangerous for a regular kid, hence the need for the harness. Especially in California, which somewhat unfortunately, Peter had started to associate with Disneyland, in fact Tony wasn\u2019t sure if the kid realised that \u2018California\u2019 and \u2018Disneyland\u2019 didn\u2019t mean the same thing. Peter had turned his nose up at the harness at first, and Tony wasn\u2019t about to force him to wear it, but once he\u2019d seen the dog backpack he\u2019d completely changed his tune and Tony was actually a little worried he wouldn\u2019t be able to get him out of it. He also really hoped that he wasn\u2019t going to start asking for a dog because there was no way Steve would be able to say no to him. \u00a0</p><p>They\u2019d got a few sideways glances as they were walking around the park, that mostly turned into embarrassment once they realised who\u2019s parenting they were judging. But between the harness, and the hoards of security that were (discreetly) accompanying them, it was the calmest Tony had felt out alone with Peter in months. </p><p>\u201cDaddy\u201d, Peter said, his lip pouting outward a little bit, he\u2019d been starting to trail behind him for about half an hour, and his little legs could only go so far. </p><p>\u201cYou getting tired bud?\u201d asked Tony, \u201cYou want me to carry you for a little while?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYes please\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d, he said, hoisting the growing child into his arms, \u201cBut only till we go get something to eat, Daddy isn\u2019t getting any younger, and what are we absolutely not allowed to do when Daddy\u2019s carrying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay with the light\u201d, Peter said, somewhat glumly, his lip starting to pout again. He had special blackout shirts that he wore when they were going somewhere fancy, but they were tight, all black and not exactly breathable, and it was Springtime in Southern California so that was definitely not happening.</p><p>\u201cUhh uh, don\u2019t give me that face, it\u2019s dangerous to play with the light, if it falls out then Daddy could get hurt, and you don\u2019t want Daddy to get hurt do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d, he said, wrapping his arms around Tony\u2019s neck. Once Peter was settled and not playing with the arc reactor he went to take him for some dinner, Tony knew he wouldn\u2019t last much longer, they\u2019d been walking around all day and he must\u2019ve been exhausted. He perked up a bit after they\u2019d eaten, but even so they made their way back to the park entrance once they were done. </p><p>Of course the next day twitter was full of pictures of them wandering around the park together, harness on full display, which apparently set off a few mommy bloggers who weren\u2019t impressed with the fact Tony Stark was leading his child around on a leash, which in turn sent a cascade of people rushing to his defense. Tony found the whole thing hilarious, arguing to Pepper (who wasn\u2019t so amused) that on the whole it was about the purest scandal he\u2019d ever been involved in. Although Steve was pretty confused as to why the first thing he was asked by the press when he got back was his opinion on mommy bloggers.</p></p>",
