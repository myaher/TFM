Yeah\" Subtly making clear to the audience that there is something different now (maybe through their heartbeats). Ep 8 will explore that they both feel awkward around each other now during the ping pong game which will go into Ep 11 when the funeral will make Cyrus realise he has a crush on TJ and should act on it. Ep 13/14 at the carnival will parallel TJ and Cyrus with Iris.",

Buffy joined him, forcing him over slightly with her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you ready to lose again?\u201d She questioned, picking up one of the remotes on the table.</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d Jonah shot back, grabbing the other remote. TJ shook his head and dropped into the chair on the right side of the room while Andi took the one spot left on the couch.</p><p>Cyrus crouched by the TV and shuffled through the discs by the system. He slid one in, craning his neck to see it had been registered as he did so. He nodded as the screen flashed and then pulled two more remotes out of the drawer below the TV</p><p>\u201cOkay which one of you is going first round and who\u2019s playing loser?\u201d Cyrus asked, holding up the last remote and waving it between TJ and Andi. \u201cI respond well to compliments,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve told you how attractive you look today,\u201d TJ pandered.</p><p>\u201cWell you told me he was cute,\u201d Jonah chimed in.</p><p>\u201cNo I didn\u2019t,\u201d TJ hissed at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah you did,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI remember because you told me not to tell him and then you said\u2014Ouch!\u201d Buffy had hit him in the chest.</p><p>\u201cCan we just pick someone to start?\u201d Buffy asked.</p><p>TJ nodded and cleared his throat, \u201cUh, let Andi go.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Cyrus held eye contact for a moment too long and TJ had to look away, feigning interest at the starting screen. He saw Andi grab the remote from Cyrus and assumed Cyrus had taken the chair on the other side of the couch. They pressed through the loading screen and then to character selection.</p><p>\u201cWait, where am I?\u201d Andi asked, spinning her cursor around. \u201cOh I\u2019m blue, let me switch with someone.\u201d She tried to lean across the couch and grab Buffy\u2019s remote, but she pulled it back from her.</p><p>\u201cNo way, I always use this one!\u201d She argued.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then switch seats with me, I need to be on the right side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right top though,\u201d Buffy pointed out. \u201cSwitch with TJ.\u201d Andi got up and walked over to his chair, so he took it as a sign he was supposed to move. He pulled himself up and then dropped back down into Andi\u2019s spot on the couch.</p><p>\u201cCan we start?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Yoshi,\u201d Buffy responded.</p><p>TJ watched as they played a Grand Prix, he would have to sit through the four races and then get to take the remote of the loser, which would likely be Cyrus. It was his game, but he was still the worst. Granted, he probably never played if Jonah and Buffy weren\u2019t over. TJ secretly loved watching him play, his facial expressions made the bickering from Jonah and Buffy worth sitting through. TJ watched as he forced his remote as right-angled as it could possibly be, biting his lip and frowning at the screen.</p><p>\u201cNo fair! I\u2019m stuck against a wall!\u201d TJ chuckled and then stood up, moving over to Cyrus\u2019 chair and leaning across it. Cyrus recognised his attempt to help and let him take the remote out of his hands. TJ sat down on the armrest, straightened the remote and then nudged it slowly to the right, hitting the button to reverse. He drove Cyrus\u2019 character to the track and then handed him the remote back. Cyrus turned around fully and smiled at him. They were so close, TJ still perched right on his side and they smiled at each other until Buffy completely lapped Cyrus, which she announced.</p><p>Cyrus turned around at that and got himself back into the game. He leaned forward in his seat, determined to not let Buffy finish with over a lap on him. To the left of him, Buffy and Jonah were in their own world. They were first and second, respectively, and Jonah was doing everything he could to change that. His eyes were darting between the top two character screens and he was \u2018accidentally\u2019 bumping into her every time she started to drift around a turn. Buffy had begun anticipating this however, and was forcing him right back, causing him to fall even farther behind. TJ looked to Andi, who was having her own battle for 4th place against the CPUs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Cyrus announced, passing Buffy on his 2nd, and her 3rd, lap. He managed to get a bullet and speed through to 10th place, grinning as wide as ever. A door slammed and TJ looked over his shoulder to the stairs. Amber came down and he nodded in greeting as she announced herself. Cyrus said hello but the rest of them mumbled a vague greeting, too into the final few seconds of the race. TJ watched Buffy pass the finish line and cheer for herself, turning toward Jonah and gloating in her victory.</p><p>Although there was now space of the couch, Amber walked over to the chair Andi was sitting on and squeezed herself on to the armrest as TJ had done with Cyrus. \u201cYou\u2019re playing Mario Kart?\u201d She commented.</p><p>\u201cPlaying? More like cheating,\u201d Jonah replied, sticking out his tongue.</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes, \u201cYou can\u2019t cheat at Mario Kart, unless you attempt to pull whatever you were doing last round.\u201d Amber gave Andi a look, which TJ caught, and Andi shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Jonah tested. He grabbed Buffy\u2019s remote and slipped it out from her hand, jumping up from the couch and darting across the room. \u201cHow will you play now?\u201d Buffy chased after him, catching him in a corner.</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t take you down?\u201d TJ looked from the scene in the corner to Cyrus, who was watching with concern. TJ knocked his leg to get the boy\u2019s attention and rose an eyebrow, then looked to Amber and Andi, who all shared a look.</p><p>Jonah faked around her right side and then slipped around the left, sprinting away and jumping up the landing of the stairs, \u201cI know you can\u2019t,\u201d he called. Buffy took off after him again and Jonah disappeared up the stairs with her on his tail.</p><p>The four kids left in the basement all let out a laugh, unsure of what really was going on between them. \u201cWe should probably go stop whatever is about to happen,\u201d Andi pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think those two should be left alone together,\u201d Amber agreed. She dropped off the armrest and pulled Andi up from her seat, leading her up the stairs.</p><p>TJ watched them disappear up the stairs and then looked down at his best friend next to him. He knocked his leg against Cyrus\u2019. \u201cYou know my sister says we shouldn\u2019t be left alone together,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Cyrus rose an eyebrow, \u201cYeah? Well, we\u2019re alone now,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>TJ looked around and nodded, \u201cWe are,\u201d he agreed. They smiled at each other for a moment, neither of them knowing really what to say. TJ dropped his arm down between them resting it on the Cyrus\u2019 leg, his palm face up. Cyrus\u2019 eyes flickered down to it, and then back up to TJ\u2019s face. TJ wasn\u2019t meeting his eyes though, more like his lips. He looked back down to TJ\u2019s hand and scooted his hand across his lap, moving a slow as possible. He inched his fingers closer to his left leg, reaching out and brushing the tips of TJ\u2019s. The feeling was always electrifying, even though he had touched TJ a million times before, when it was like this, slow and purposeful with feelings behind it, it made it a million times more intense.</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d His hand shot back, as if having been zapped. He jumped up with the movement, TJ following him almost as quickly. Cyrus went red almost immediately and TJ could feel his cheeks getting warm. \u201cYou guys coming up?\u201d He heard Andi call.</p><p>\u201cY\u2014\u201d His voice cracked, \u201cYeah!\u201d He yelled back. He gave TJ a weak smile, who returned it, and ran up the stairs.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>They were sitting alone together later that evening, out on Cyrus\u2019 porch after Amber had gone in to get her jacket. They were always the last ones at Cyrus house at the end of the night, they lived right next door. Cyrus looked at the door Amber had gone through moments earlier, thinking about the moment\u2014almost moment\u2014he and TJ had shared a few hours earlier. \u201cWhy do you think she said that?\u201d Cyrus asked, hoping to bring up a conversation about their\u2014whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cSaid what?\u201d TJ replied, obviously not up-to-date with Cyrus\u2019 thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThat we probably shouldn\u2019t be left alone together,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d TJ shrugged, \u201cAmber has a lot of weird theories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike her one about Buffy?\u201d Cyrus joked. \u201cDo you think she doesn\u2019t want us, alone?\u201d He asked, hoping for some kind of deeper explanation. It was dark outside and hard for him to really make out TJ\u2019s features, but he could tell the boy was unsure of what to \u00a0say. He shrugged and Cyrus looked back over to the door. \u201cBut then she left as alone,\u201d He pointed out.</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cHm, she did do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she even bring a jacket?\u201d Cyrus wondered.</p><p>\u201cI think she doesn\u2019t want us to ruin our friendship,\u201d TJ said softly. Oh, he was actually thinking this whole time, Cyrus realised.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we would?\u201d Cyrus asked, his tone matching TJ\u2019s. TJ was closer to him again, moving forward so silently Cyrus had barely noticed. He could hear his breathing hitch slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could ruin anything. We\u2019re already&hellip;\u201d he stopped, unsure of how to finish that sentence.</p><p>\u201cPretty close?\u201d Cyrus attempted.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ agreed, dropping his hand back down between them again, \u201cClose.\u201d Cyrus looked down at his hand and felt his breathing hitch. He looked back toward the door, Amber had been gone a while, and then looked back to TJ\u2019s hand. He hesitated, a moment too long he assumed, and TJ stood up. \u201cI should probably get going,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cyrus stood up as well. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, nodding a little too quickly. \u201cShould we go get Amber?\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, \u201cShe knows how to get home.\u201d Cyrus nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything. TJ was looking at him, his eyes moving between Cyrus\u2019 and his lips. Cyrus had to remind himself how to breathe. Neither of them said anything, standing there in the dark, obviously just waiting for the other to make a move. Cyrus wasn\u2019t going to make a move, he couldn\u2019t. He still couldn\u2019t gage where they were exactly, how they felt about each other. It was weird, after knowing TJ for so long; Even if they had just agreed it wouldn\u2019t ruin anything, he was still wary of finally crossing that line.</p><p>Luckily, TJ stepped in, planting a kiss on Cyrus\u2019 lips and then immediately stepping back, his eyes tracking the boy\u2019s face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cW-what was that for?\u201d Cyrus stuttered, in slight shock.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see what it was like,\u201d TJ admitted, looking down at the floor. Cyrus was sure both of them were bright red, he silently thanked his mom for forgetting to replace the porch light.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all Cyrus could say.</p><p>\u201cWas that okay?\u201d He sounded worried.</p><p>Cyrus nodded. Yes, yes, of course it was fine. It was more than fine it was all he had wanted for months. It was what he had been dreaming about, yet he couldn\u2019t say anything. Why couldn\u2019t he say anything? He was just standing there, nodding like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to overwhelm you,\u201d TJ said. He got it, he knew why Cyrus was speechless. Of course he got it. \u201cBut maybe we could try again later?\u201d He added. Cyrus nodded, kept on nodding. Yes, trying again later was good! Again being the keyword, mainly, but later was good too.</p><p>He smiled. At least Cyrus could see that smile through the dim lighting, that smile that meant they were definitely okay. \u201cGoodnight, Cyrus,\u201d he said, finally turning away and stepping off the porch.</p><p>He watched TJ walk away, disappearing around the side of the house. The door creaked as it was angled open, and Cyrus met Amber\u2019s eyes. She shook her head, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that!\u201d Cyrus said, his hand ghosting over his lips.</p><p>\u201cNeither was I,\u201d Amber admitted. \u201cWas it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was phenomenal,\u201d Cyrus breathed. \u201cI just, wish I had kissed him back. That\u2019s a thing people do, right?\u201d</p><p>Amber laughed. \u201cYes, that\u2019s a thing. You\u2019ll have time,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cShould I apologise?\u201d He asked, looking back over to the Kippen\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cHe knows you, Cyrus. He\u2019s known you since you were five, I\u2019m sure he knew how you were going to react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to react!\u201d Cyrus pushed. \u201cI thought I would be ready, I thought I could at least hold a conversation after!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you fall over after he hugged you two weeks ago?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d Cyrus argued, \u201cI just tripped when he let go.\u201d Amber rolled her eyes and Cyrus sighed. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut overthinking is my specialty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo trust TJ knows that, dummy. He knows you better than anyone else in this world, that\u2019s what makes this perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd scary,\u201d Cyrus added.</p><p>\u201cScary is fun,\u201d Amber countered. \u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d she promised, stepping down off the porch. \u201cBut he won\u2019t want me too involved.\u201d Cyrus nodded in thanks and turned back inside as she walked off toward her house. He wasn\u2019t going to be sleeping tonight.</p>",

He managed to get a bullet and speed through to 10th place, grinning as wide as ever. A door slammed and TJ looked over his shoulder to the stairs. Amber came down and he nodded in greeting as she announced herself. Cyrus said hello but the rest of them mumbled a vague greeting, too into the final few seconds of the race. TJ watched Buffy pass the finish line and cheer for herself, turning toward Jonah and gloating in her victory.</p><p>Although there was now space of the couch, Amber walked over to the chair Andi was sitting on and squeezed herself on to the armrest as TJ had done with Cyrus. \u201cYou\u2019re playing Mario Kart?\u201d She commented.</p><p>\u201cPlaying? More like cheating,\u201d Jonah replied, sticking out his tongue.</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes, \u201cYou can\u2019t cheat at Mario Kart, unless you attempt to pull whatever you were doing last round.\u201d Amber gave Andi a look, which TJ caught, and Andi shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Jonah tested. He grabbed Buffy\u2019s remote and slipped it out from her hand, jumping up from the couch and darting across the room. \u201cHow will you play now?\u201d Buffy chased after him, catching him in a corner.</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t take you down?\u201d TJ looked from the scene in the corner to Cyrus, who was watching with concern. TJ knocked his leg to get the boy\u2019s attention and rose an eyebrow, then looked to Amber and Andi, who all shared a look.</p><p>Jonah faked around her right side and then slipped around the left, sprinting away and jumping up the landing of the stairs, \u201cI know you can\u2019t,\u201d he called. Buffy took off after him again and Jonah disappeared up the stairs with her on his tail.</p><p>The four kids left in the basement all let out a laugh, unsure of what really was going on between them. \u201cWe should probably go stop whatever is about to happen,\u201d Andi pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think those two should be left alone together,\u201d Amber agreed. She dropped off the armrest and pulled Andi up from her seat, leading her up the stairs.</p><p>TJ watched them disappear up the stairs and then looked down at his best friend next to him. He knocked his leg against Cyrus\u2019. \u201cYou know my sister says we shouldn\u2019t be left alone together,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Cyrus rose an eyebrow, \u201cYeah? Well, we\u2019re alone now,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>TJ looked around and nodded, \u201cWe are,\u201d he agreed. They smiled at each other for a moment, neither of them knowing really what to say. TJ dropped his arm down between them resting it on the Cyrus\u2019 leg, his palm face up. Cyrus\u2019 eyes flickered down to it, and then back up to TJ\u2019s face. TJ wasn\u2019t meeting his eyes though, more like his lips. He looked back down to TJ\u2019s hand and scooted his hand across his lap, moving a slow as possible. He inched his fingers closer to his left leg, reaching out and brushing the tips of TJ\u2019s. The feeling was always electrifying, even though he had touched TJ a million times before, when it was like this, slow and purposeful with feelings behind it, it made it a million times more intense.</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d His hand shot back, as if having been zapped. He jumped up with the movement, TJ following him almost as quickly. Cyrus went red almost immediately and TJ could feel his cheeks getting warm. \u201cYou guys coming up?\u201d He heard Andi call.</p><p>\u201cY\u2014\u201d His voice cracked, \u201cYeah!\u201d He yelled back. He gave TJ a weak smile, who returned it, and ran up the stairs.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>They were sitting alone together later that evening, out on Cyrus\u2019 porch after Amber had gone in to get her jacket. They were always the last ones at Cyrus house at the end of the night, they lived right next door. Cyrus looked at the door Amber had gone through moments earlier, thinking about the moment\u2014almost moment\u2014he and TJ had shared a few hours earlier. \u201cWhy do you think she said that?\u201d Cyrus asked, hoping to bring up a conversation about their\u2014whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cSaid what?\u201d TJ replied, obviously not up-to-date with Cyrus\u2019 thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThat we probably shouldn\u2019t be left alone together,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d TJ shrugged, \u201cAmber has a lot of weird theories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike her one about Buffy?\u201d Cyrus joked. \u201cDo you think she doesn\u2019t want us, alone?\u201d He asked, hoping for some kind of deeper explanation. It was dark outside and hard for him to really make out TJ\u2019s features, but he could tell the boy was unsure of what to \u00a0say. He shrugged and Cyrus looked back over to the door. \u201cBut then she left as alone,\u201d He pointed out.</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cHm, she did do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she even bring a jacket?\u201d Cyrus wondered.</p><p>\u201cI think she doesn\u2019t want us to ruin our friendship,\u201d TJ said softly. Oh, he was actually thinking this whole time, Cyrus realised.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we would?\u201d Cyrus asked, his tone matching TJ\u2019s. TJ was closer to him again, moving forward so silently Cyrus had barely noticed. He could hear his breathing hitch slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could ruin anything. We\u2019re already\u2026\u201d he stopped, unsure of how to finish that sentence.</p><p>\u201cPretty close?\u201d Cyrus attempted.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ agreed, dropping his hand back down between them again, \u201cClose.\u201d Cyrus looked down at his hand and felt his breathing hitch. He looked back toward the door, Amber had been gone a while, and then looked back to TJ\u2019s hand. He hesitated, a moment too long he assumed, and TJ stood up. \u201cI should probably get going,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cyrus stood up as well. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, nodding a little too quickly. \u201cShould we go get Amber?\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, \u201cShe knows how to get home.\u201d Cyrus nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything. TJ was looking at him, his eyes moving between Cyrus\u2019 and his lips. Cyrus had to remind himself how to breathe. Neither of them said anything, standing there in the dark, obviously just waiting for the other to make a move. Cyrus wasn\u2019t going to make a move, he couldn\u2019t. He still couldn\u2019t gage where they were exactly, how they felt about each other. It was weird, after knowing TJ for so long; Even if they had just agreed it wouldn\u2019t ruin anything, he was still wary of finally crossing that line.</p><p>Luckily, TJ stepped in, planting a kiss on Cyrus\u2019 lips and then immediately stepping back, his eyes tracking the boy\u2019s face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cW-what was that for?\u201d Cyrus stuttered, in slight shock.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see what it was like,\u201d TJ admitted, looking down at the floor. Cyrus was sure both of them were bright red, he silently thanked his mom for forgetting to replace the porch light.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all Cyrus could say.</p><p>\u201cWas that okay?\u201d He sounded worried.</p><p>Cyrus nodded. Yes, yes, of course it was fine. It was more than fine it was all he had wanted for months. It was what he had been dreaming about, yet he couldn\u2019t say anything. Why couldn\u2019t he say anything? He was just standing there, nodding like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to overwhelm you,\u201d TJ said. He got it, he knew why Cyrus was speechless. Of course he got it. \u201cBut maybe we could try again later?\u201d He added. Cyrus nodded, kept on nodding. Yes, trying again later was good! Again being the keyword, mainly, but later was good too.</p><p>He smiled. At least Cyrus could see that smile through the dim lighting, that smile that meant they were definitely okay. \u201cGoodnight, Cyrus,\u201d he said, finally turning away and stepping off the porch.</p><p>He watched TJ walk away, disappearing around the side of the house. The door creaked as it was angled open, and Cyrus met Amber\u2019s eyes. She shook her head, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that!\u201d Cyrus said, his hand ghosting over his lips.</p><p>\u201cNeither was I,\u201d Amber admitted. \u201cWas it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was phenomenal,\u201d Cyrus breathed. \u201cI just, wish I had kissed him back. That\u2019s a thing people do, right?\u201d</p><p>Amber laughed. \u201cYes, that\u2019s a thing. You\u2019ll have time,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cShould I apologise?\u201d He asked, looking back over to the Kippen\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cHe knows you, Cyrus. He\u2019s known you since you were five, I\u2019m sure he knew how you were going to react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to react!\u201d Cyrus pushed. \u201cI thought I would be ready, I thought I could at least hold a conversation after!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you fall over after he hugged you two weeks ago?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d Cyrus argued, \u201cI just tripped when he let go.\u201d Amber rolled her eyes and Cyrus sighed. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut overthinking is my specialty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo trust TJ knows that, dummy. He knows you better than anyone else in this world, that\u2019s what makes this perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd scary,\u201d Cyrus added.</p><p>\u201cScary is fun,\u201d Amber countered. \u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d she promised, stepping down off the porch. \u201cBut he won\u2019t want me too involved.\u201d Cyrus nodded in thanks and turned back inside as she walked off toward her house. He wasn\u2019t going to be sleeping tonight.</p>",

It\u2019ll jump around in the timeline and just pick points of their relationship to focus on in each part I write so it\u2019s under a series <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/series/1190599\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> on Ao3!</b></p><p><b>Enjoy the first thing I have :)</b></p><p>\u201cMario Kart!\u201d Jonah announced, throwing himself down on the couch. Buffy joined him, forcing him over slightly with her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you ready to lose again?\u201d She questioned, picking up one of the remotes on the table.</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d Jonah shot back, grabbing the other remote. TJ shook his head and dropped into the chair on the right side of the room while Andi took the one spot left on the couch.</p><p>Cyrus crouched by the TV and shuffled through the discs by the system. He slid one in, craning his neck to see it had been registered as he did so. He nodded as the screen flashed and then pulled two more remotes out of the drawer below the TV</p><p>\u201cOkay which one of you is going first round and who\u2019s playing loser?\u201d Cyrus asked, holding up the last remote and waving it between TJ and Andi. \u201cI respond well to compliments,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve told you how attractive you look today,\u201d TJ pandered.</p><p>\u201cWell you told me he was cute,\u201d Jonah chimed in.</p><p>\u201cNo I didn\u2019t,\u201d TJ hissed at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah you did,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI remember because you told me not to tell him and then you said\u2014Ouch!\u201d Buffy had hit him in the chest.</p><p>\u201cCan we just pick someone to start?\u201d Buffy asked.</p><p>TJ nodded and cleared his throat, \u201cUh, let Andi go.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Cyrus held eye contact for a moment too long and TJ had to look away, feigning interest at the starting screen. He saw Andi grab the remote from Cyrus and assumed Cyrus had taken the chair on the other side of the couch. They pressed through the loading screen and then to character selection.</p><p>\u201cWait, where am I?\u201d Andi asked, spinning her cursor around. \u201cOh I\u2019m blue, let me switch with someone.\u201d She tried to lean across the couch and grab Buffy\u2019s remote, but she pulled it back from her.</p><p>\u201cNo way, I always use this one!\u201d She argued.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then switch seats with me, I need to be on the right side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right top though,\u201d Buffy pointed out. \u201cSwitch with TJ.\u201d Andi got up and walked over to his chair, so he took it as a sign he was supposed to move. He pulled himself up and then dropped back down into Andi\u2019s spot on the couch.</p><p>\u201cCan we start?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Yoshi,\u201d Buffy responded.</p><p>TJ watched as they played a Grand Prix, he would have to sit through the four races and then get to take the remote of the loser, which would likely be Cyrus. It was his game, but he was still the worst. Granted, he probably never played if Jonah and Buffy weren\u2019t over. TJ secretly loved watching him play, his facial expressions made the bickering from Jonah and Buffy worth sitting through. TJ watched as he forced his remote as right-angled as it could possibly be, biting his lip and frowning at the screen.</p><p>\u201cNo fair! I\u2019m stuck against a wall!\u201d TJ chuckled and then stood up, moving over to Cyrus\u2019 chair and leaning across it. Cyrus recognised his attempt to help and let him take the remote out of his hands. TJ sat down on the armrest, straightened the remote and then nudged it slowly to the right, hitting the button to reverse. He drove Cyrus\u2019 character to the track and then handed him the remote back. Cyrus turned around fully and smiled at him. They were so close, TJ still perched right on his side and they smiled at each other until Buffy completely lapped Cyrus, which she announced.</p><p>Cyrus turned around at that and got himself back into the game. He leaned forward in his seat, determined to not let Buffy finish with over a lap on him. To the left of him, Buffy and Jonah were in their own world. They were first and second, respectively, and Jonah was doing everything he could to change that. His eyes were darting between the top two character screens and he was \u2018accidentally\u2019 bumping into her every time she started to drift around a turn. Buffy had begun anticipating this however, and was forcing him right back, causing him to fall even farther behind. TJ looked to Andi, who was having her own battle for 4th place against the CPUs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Cyrus announced, passing Buffy on his 2nd, and her 3rd, lap. He managed to get a bullet and speed through to 10th place, grinning as wide as ever. A door slammed and TJ looked over his shoulder to the stairs.

Cyrus was sure both of them were bright red, he silently thanked his mom for forgetting to replace the porch light.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all Cyrus could say.</p><p>\u201cWas that okay?\u201d He sounded worried.</p><p>Cyrus nodded. Yes, yes, of course it was fine. It was more than fine it was all he had wanted for months. It was what he had been dreaming about, yet he couldn\u2019t say anything. Why couldn\u2019t he say anything? He was just standing there, nodding like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to overwhelm you,\u201d TJ said. He got it, he knew why Cyrus was speechless. Of course he got it. \u201cBut maybe we could try again later?\u201d He added. Cyrus nodded, kept on nodding. Yes, trying again later was good! Again being the keyword, mainly, but later was good too.</p><p>He smiled. At least Cyrus could see that smile through the dim lighting, that smile that meant they were definitely okay. \u201cGoodnight, Cyrus,\u201d he said, finally turning away and stepping off the porch.</p><p>He watched TJ walk away, disappearing around the side of the house. The door creaked as it was angled open, and Cyrus met Amber\u2019s eyes. She shook her head, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that!\u201d Cyrus said, his hand ghosting over his lips.</p><p>\u201cNeither was I,\u201d Amber admitted. \u201cWas it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was phenomenal,\u201d Cyrus breathed. \u201cI just, wish I had kissed him back. That\u2019s a thing people do, right?\u201d</p><p>Amber laughed. \u201cYes, that\u2019s a thing. You\u2019ll have time,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cShould I apologise?\u201d He asked, looking back over to the Kippen\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cHe knows you, Cyrus. He\u2019s known you since you were five, I\u2019m sure he knew how you were going to react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to react!\u201d Cyrus pushed. \u201cI thought I would be ready, I thought I could at least hold a conversation after!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you fall over after he hugged you two weeks ago?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d Cyrus argued, \u201cI just tripped when he let go.\u201d Amber rolled her eyes and Cyrus sighed. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut overthinking is my specialty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo trust TJ knows that, dummy. He knows you better than anyone else in this world, that\u2019s what makes this perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd scary,\u201d Cyrus added.</p><p>\u201cScary is fun,\u201d Amber countered. \u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d she promised, stepping down off the porch. \u201cBut he won\u2019t want me too involved.\u201d Cyrus nodded in thanks and turned back inside as she walked off toward her house. He wasn\u2019t going to be sleeping tonight.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>I&rsquo;m working on a bit of a series where TJ and Cyrus are neighbours and have known each other since they were little kids and end up realising their feelings for each other while being unsure of what do to. It&rsquo;ll jump around in the timeline and just pick points of their relationship to focus on in each part I write so it&rsquo;s under a series <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/series/1190599\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> on Ao3!</b></p><p><b>Enjoy the first thing I have :)</b></p><p>&ldquo;Mario Kart!&rdquo; Jonah announced, throwing himself down on the couch. Buffy joined him, forcing him over slightly with her body.</p><p>&ldquo;What, you ready to lose again?&rdquo; She questioned, picking up one of the remotes on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;In your dreams,&rdquo; Jonah shot back, grabbing the other remote. TJ shook his head and dropped into the chair on the right side of the room while Andi took the one spot left on the couch.</p><p>Cyrus crouched by the TV and shuffled through the discs by the system. He slid one in, craning his neck to see it had been registered as he did so. He nodded as the screen flashed and then pulled two more remotes out of the drawer below the TV</p><p>&ldquo;Okay which one of you is going first round and who&rsquo;s playing loser?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, holding up the last remote and waving it between TJ and Andi. &ldquo;I respond well to compliments,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve told you how attractive you look today,&rdquo; TJ pandered.</p><p>&ldquo;Well you told me he was cute,&rdquo; Jonah chimed in.</p><p>&ldquo;No I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; TJ hissed at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah you did,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I remember because you told me not to tell him and then you said&mdash;Ouch!&rdquo; Buffy had hit him in the chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we just pick someone to start?&rdquo; Buffy asked.</p><p>TJ nodded and cleared his throat, &ldquo;Uh, let Andi go.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus held eye contact for a moment too long and TJ had to look away, feigning interest at the starting screen. He saw Andi grab the remote from Cyrus and assumed Cyrus had taken the chair on the other side of the couch. They pressed through the loading screen and then to character selection.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, where am I?&rdquo; Andi asked, spinning her cursor around. &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m blue, let me switch with someone.&rdquo; She tried to lean across the couch and grab Buffy&rsquo;s remote, but she pulled it back from her.</p><p>&ldquo;No way, I always use this one!&rdquo; She argued.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, then switch seats with me, I need to be on the right side.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right top though,&rdquo; Buffy pointed out. &ldquo;Switch with TJ.&rdquo; Andi got up and walked over to his chair, so he took it as a sign he was supposed to move. He pulled himself up and then dropped back down into Andi&rsquo;s spot on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we start?&rdquo; Jonah asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Yoshi,&rdquo; Buffy responded.</p><p>TJ watched as they played a Grand Prix, he would have to sit through the four races and then get to take the remote of the loser, which would likely be Cyrus. It was his game, but he was still the worst. Granted, he probably never played if Jonah and Buffy weren&rsquo;t over. TJ secretly loved watching him play, his facial expressions made the bickering from Jonah and Buffy worth sitting through. TJ watched as he forced his remote as right-angled as it could possibly be, biting his lip and frowning at the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;No fair! I&rsquo;m stuck against a wall!&rdquo; TJ chuckled and then stood up, moving over to Cyrus&rsquo; chair and leaning across it. Cyrus recognised his attempt to help and let him take the remote out of his hands. TJ sat down on the armrest, straightened the remote and then nudged it slowly to the right, hitting the button to reverse. He drove Cyrus&rsquo; character to the track and then handed him the remote back. Cyrus turned around fully and smiled at him. They were so close, TJ still perched right on his side and they smiled at each other until Buffy completely lapped Cyrus, which she announced.</p><p>Cyrus turned around at that and got himself back into the game. He leaned forward in his seat, determined to not let Buffy finish with over a lap on him. To the left of him, Buffy and Jonah were in their own world. They were first and second, respectively, and Jonah was doing everything he could to change that. His eyes were darting between the top two character screens and he was &lsquo;accidentally&rsquo; bumping into her every time she started to drift around a turn. Buffy had begun anticipating this however, and was forcing him right back, causing him to fall even farther behind. TJ looked to Andi, who was having her own battle for 4th place against the CPUs.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back!&rdquo; Cyrus announced, passing Buffy on his 2nd, and her 3rd, lap. He managed to get a bullet and speed through to 10th place, grinning as wide as ever. A door slammed and TJ looked over his shoulder to the stairs. Amber came down and he nodded in greeting as she announced herself. Cyrus said hello but the rest of them mumbled a vague greeting, too into the final few seconds of the race. TJ watched Buffy pass the finish line and cheer for herself, turning toward Jonah and gloating in her victory.</p><p>Although there was now space of the couch, Amber walked over to the chair Andi was sitting on and squeezed herself on to the armrest as TJ had done with Cyrus. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing Mario Kart?&rdquo; She commented.</p><p>&ldquo;Playing? More like cheating,&rdquo; Jonah replied, sticking out his tongue.</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t cheat at Mario Kart, unless you attempt to pull whatever you were doing last round.&rdquo; Amber gave Andi a look, which TJ caught, and Andi shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; Jonah tested. He grabbed Buffy&rsquo;s remote and slipped it out from her hand, jumping up from the couch and darting across the room. &ldquo;How will you play now?&rdquo; Buffy chased after him, catching him in a corner.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I can&rsquo;t take you down?&rdquo; TJ looked from the scene in the corner to Cyrus, who was watching with concern. TJ knocked his leg to get the boy&rsquo;s attention and rose an eyebrow, then looked to Amber and Andi, who all shared a look.</p><p>Jonah faked around her right side and then slipped around the left, sprinting away and jumping up the landing of the stairs, &ldquo;I know you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he called. Buffy took off after him again and Jonah disappeared up the stairs with her on his tail.</p><p>The four kids left in the basement all let out a laugh, unsure of what really was going on between them. &ldquo;We should probably go stop whatever is about to happen,&rdquo; Andi pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think those two should be left alone together,&rdquo; Amber agreed. She dropped off the armrest and pulled Andi up from her seat, leading her up the stairs.</p><p>TJ watched them disappear up the stairs and then looked down at his best friend next to him. He knocked his leg against Cyrus&rsquo;. &ldquo;You know my sister says we shouldn&rsquo;t be left alone together,&rdquo; he commented.</p><p>Cyrus rose an eyebrow, &ldquo;Yeah? Well, we&rsquo;re alone now,&rdquo; he pointed out.</p><p>TJ looked around and nodded, &ldquo;We are,&rdquo; he agreed. They smiled at each other for a moment, neither of them knowing really what to say. TJ dropped his arm down between them resting it on the Cyrus&rsquo; leg, his palm face up. Cyrus&rsquo; eyes flickered down to it, and then back up to TJ&rsquo;s face. TJ wasn&rsquo;t meeting his eyes though, more like his lips. He looked back down to TJ&rsquo;s hand and scooted his hand across his lap, moving a slow as possible. He inched his fingers closer to his left leg, reaching out and brushing the tips of TJ&rsquo;s. The feeling was always electrifying, even though he had touched TJ a million times before, when it was like this, slow and purposeful with feelings behind it, it made it a million times more intense.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus!&rdquo; His hand shot back, as if having been zapped. He jumped up with the movement, TJ following him almost as quickly. Cyrus went red almost immediately and TJ could feel his cheeks getting warm. &ldquo;You guys coming up?&rdquo; He heard Andi call.</p><p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;&rdquo; His voice cracked, &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; He yelled back. He gave TJ a weak smile, who returned it, and ran up the stairs.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>They were sitting alone together later that evening, out on Cyrus&rsquo; porch after Amber had gone in to get her jacket. They were always the last ones at Cyrus house at the end of the night, they lived right next door. Cyrus looked at the door Amber had gone through moments earlier, thinking about the moment&mdash;almost moment&mdash;he and TJ had shared a few hours earlier. &ldquo;Why do you think she said that?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, hoping to bring up a conversation about their&mdash;whatever it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Said what?&rdquo; TJ replied, obviously not up-to-date with Cyrus&rsquo; thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;That we probably shouldn&rsquo;t be left alone together,&rdquo; he clarified.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; TJ shrugged, &ldquo;Amber has a lot of weird theories.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like her one about Buffy?&rdquo; Cyrus joked. &ldquo;Do you think she doesn&rsquo;t want us, alone?&rdquo; He asked, hoping for some kind of deeper explanation. It was dark outside and hard for him to really make out TJ&rsquo;s features, but he could tell the boy was unsure of what to &nbsp;say. He shrugged and Cyrus looked back over to the door. &ldquo;But then she left as alone,&rdquo; He pointed out.</p><p>TJ nodded. &ldquo;Hm, she did do that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did she even bring a jacket?&rdquo; Cyrus wondered.</p><p>&ldquo;I think she doesn&rsquo;t want us to ruin our friendship,&rdquo; TJ said softly. Oh, he was actually thinking this whole time, Cyrus realised.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think we would?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, his tone matching TJ&rsquo;s. TJ was closer to him again, moving forward so silently Cyrus had barely noticed. He could hear his breathing hitch slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we could ruin anything. We&rsquo;re already&hellip;&rdquo; he stopped, unsure of how to finish that sentence.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty close?&rdquo; Cyrus attempted.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; TJ agreed, dropping his hand back down between them again, &ldquo;Close.&rdquo; Cyrus looked down at his hand and felt his breathing hitch. He looked back toward the door, Amber had been gone a while, and then looked back to TJ&rsquo;s hand. He hesitated, a moment too long he assumed, and TJ stood up. &ldquo;I should probably get going,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Cyrus stood up as well. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, nodding a little too quickly. &ldquo;Should we go get Amber?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shrugged, &ldquo;She knows how to get home.&rdquo; Cyrus nodded, but didn&rsquo;t say anything. TJ was looking at him, his eyes moving between Cyrus&rsquo; and his lips. Cyrus had to remind himself how to breathe. Neither of them said anything, standing there in the dark, obviously just waiting for the other to make a move. Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t going to make a move, he couldn&rsquo;t. He still couldn&rsquo;t gage where they were exactly, how they felt about each other. It was weird, after knowing TJ for so long; Even if they had just agreed it wouldn&rsquo;t ruin anything, he was still wary of finally crossing that line.</p><p>Luckily, TJ stepped in, planting a kiss on Cyrus&rsquo; lips and then immediately stepping back, his eyes tracking the boy&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;W-what was that for?&rdquo; Cyrus stuttered, in slight shock.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to see what it was like,&rdquo; TJ admitted, looking down at the floor.
