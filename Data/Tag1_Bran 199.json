When Fionn asked Finegas why he spend his days fishing, Finegas would give him no answer. Then one morning, Finegas had caught the salmon.</p><p>Finegas gave the fish to Fionn, and told him to cook it with instructions not to eat it. Fionn then built a fire and cooked the salmon, however when he was turning it, he burnt his finger on a drop of hot fish fat. Fionn sucked on his burned finger to ease the pain. Unbeknownst to Fionn, all of the salmon&rsquo;s wisdom had been concentrated into that one drop of fat.</p><p>When he brought the cooked meal to Finegas, Finegas saw that the Fionn&rsquo;s eyes shone with an unseen wisdom. Finegas asked Fionn if he had eaten any of the salmon, to which Fionn answered no, and Fionn proceeded to explain what had happened. Finegas realized that Fionn had received the wisdom, so gave him the rest of the salmon to eat. Fionn ate the salmon and in so doing gained all the knowledge of the world. Fionn could from then on draw upon this knowledge from the salmon by biting his thumb.</p><p>Fionn is connected to many of the legends of the Fenian Cycle in Irish mythology, however it is this tale where he first came to prominence.</p><p><b>The similarities to Bran:</b></p><ul><li>Both Fionn and Bran are young young boys how are given great knowledge that marks the beginning of their epic journeys.<br/></li><li>In the story, Fionn gains the knowledge of the world through an injury, and the beginning of Bran&rsquo;s metaphysical awakening truly begins after he is crippled by Jaime.<br/></li><li>The origin of the knowledge gained by Fionn and Bran derives from trees.

                "content": "<p>So I was at my grandparents house the other day and so were a few of my cousins, who are all 8-12 years younger than me. My grandfather was telling them some stories about Irish legends and folklore, like he used to tell me when I was younger, and he told them the story of the Salmon of Knowledge. As I was listening to the story I realized it reminded me a lot of Bran.<br /></p><p><b>The story of the Salmon of Knowledge goes like this:</b></p><p>There was an ordinary salmon ate nine hazelnuts that fell into the Well of Wisdom and from nine hazel trees that surrounded the well. As a result, the salmon gained all the world&rsquo;s knowledge and the first to eat of its flesh would gain it&rsquo;s knowledge.</p><p>A young Fionn Mac Cumhail, the legendary Irish warrior and hunter who led the band of warriors known as the Fianna and created the famous Giants Causeway was helping the poet Finegas, one of the wisest men in Ireland, who had tried for seven years to catch the fish but to no avail.</p><p>Fionn was unaware of the legend about the salmon of knowledge. When Fionn asked Finegas why he spend his days fishing, Finegas would give him no answer. Then one morning, Finegas had caught the salmon.</p><p>Finegas gave the fish to Fionn, and told him to cook it with instructions not to eat it.

                "content": "<p>1. <b>What OTPs in your fandom(s) do you just not get?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Bran and Meera. Bran is 10 years old and Meera is 17. It&rsquo;s not a romance. The actress who played Meera is 28 and Bran&rsquo;s actor turned 19 this year meaning that for a large part of their shared storyline the age gap was really icky. I just don&rsquo;t see it. I think she&rsquo;s an older sister figure and that his crush is both innocent and has hints of his trauma.</p><p>3. <b>Have you ever unfollowed someone over a fandom opinion?&nbsp;</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty tolerant despite how I come off. I never seen Bran hate except the usual claims that he is so boring (like there aren&rsquo;t many boring character who need battle scenes to seem interesting). Mostly people just ignore him :( . I&rsquo;m guilty of that too because there&rsquo;s so much Sansa, Catelyn, Elia and Cersei content to get through.
