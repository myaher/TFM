        "body": "<p>I\u2019m one of those people who\u2019s been around since the beginning. My love of reading was apparent from an early age. I like to say I inherited it from my grandfather who owns a huge collection of books, a whole library really. I taught myself to read at 5 so by the time I entered school I was ahead of the class on this account and I always devoured anything magical, mythological or fantastic above all.</p><p>When I was 7 or 8 the first Harry Potter book was published in my language (Icelandic). With my reading love already well established it was only natural that I got the book for either my birthday or christmas, I honestly can\u2019t remember which. I read it and I was in love.</p><p>There\u2019s not a great number of books translated into Icelandic, at least nothing compared to the English language hoard of books available, so I read through everything at my small local library (I am not exaggerating when I say I had read every book in any way magical before the age of 14). So I tended to reread books a lot and Harry Potter was one of my favourites to do this with. Basically I reread the first book until the second came out. Then I read the first and second in order again and again until the third came out, and so on.</p><p>By the 4th book my father offered to buy me the book in English, saying it would be good practice. I didn\u2019t trust myself just yet to understand everything in it and with Harry I wanted to understand every word. When the 6th book came out I was ready. I was tired of waiting (at first half a year often, with the later books and the series growing popularity only a month or two) for a translation, I had already waited for Jo to finish writing the book and I knew I could handle it. So I switched languages.</p><p>It\u2019s a weird thing to do in the middle of a series, past the middle really, but I had to have the book immediately. So I joined a midnight lineup and got the book in English. With the 7th I was on holiday so my family wouldn\u2019t let me join the lineup alone but I bought it immediately the next day and locked myself in the bathroom (the only place I was free from the noise of my family in my uncle\u2019s small apartment we were staying at) while I read and cried and read and cried some more.</p><p>I\u2019ve revisited the story several times but after becoming fluent in English this whole world of books I could never access before opened up to me and I don\u2019t reread as much as I used to. I\u2019ve a pretty good memory (for stories at least, nothing else) so usually it\u2019s enough for me to look at a book, maybe page through it a bit, to remember the story. Yet I\u2019ve only read the final book once. I think the grief of leaving Harry and everyone who died was too much for me and I just haven\u2019t been able to yet. I\u2019ve also always felt like I need to read them in order, start with Philosopher\u2019s Stone and work my way up to Deathly Hallows. So that\u2019s what I am now doing.</p><p>Since I don\u2019t have as much time to read as I did and spend a lot of time on busses (and get horribly carsick if I read on them, a fact I will loathe till the day I die) I decided to listen to some podcasts along the way, specifically ones that discuss the chapters or books one by one in order so I can listen to them following my reading. I\u2019ll also be posting random things on here as I go along, thoughts and comments and of course reblogging a whole bunch of Potter related things.</p><p>Thanks for reading and hopefully you\u2019ll enjoy the ride with me :)</p>",
