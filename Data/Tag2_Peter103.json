It\u2019s also on my ao3 account faldris.</i></p><p>Morgan Stark was born on the day of Peter\u2019s graduation. He would be lying if he said that he wasn\u2019t devastated when he looked out from the stage and saw Tony\u2019s seat empty, but as soon as the ceremony was over and May quickly pulled him aside and said Pepper was having the baby, he couldn\u2019t have been happier. He insisted that May drive him to the hospital immediately, despite her saying it could be a long time before the baby was actually born and he should go and celebrate with his friends. Once he was there, he wasn\u2019t allowed to see Pepper and Tony, so he patiently sat in the waiting room, staring at the door as if he expected Tony to burst through with a baby in his arms.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cPete, you can\u2019t just sit here the whole time,\u201d May gently said after half an hour of waiting.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to miss anything!\u201d He gave her his best puppy dog eyes, hoping she wouldn\u2019t make him leave.</p><p>\u201cThese things take time, if I remember correctly your Mum was in the hospital for almost a full 24 hours before you finally came out. Besides, Tony will text you if anything happens.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut what if he\u2019s too preoccupied with the baby and forgets?\u201d May\u2019s face softens.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to forget. Weren\u2019t you the first one he told?\u201d Peter nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, you should be out celebrating with your friends. I\u2019m sure Tony wouldn\u2019t want you wait here for ages while all your friends were having fun.\u201d Peter lowed his head.</p><p>\u201cJust a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 minutes, okay? Then I\u2019m taking you back to Ned\u2019s.\u201d Peter nodded reluctantly and May smiled. Somehow the time simultaneously passed both too slowly and too quickly for Peter\u2019s liking. The minutes passed, 7, 8, 9&hellip; May looked at him, her face telling him she wouldn\u2019t let him stay any longer. 10. May stood up and gestured for Peter to do the same, but just as he was getting up the door opened and Peter spun around. As if he had been waiting for just the right moment to appear, Tony walked through the door. Seemingly oblivious to everyone else, Tony walked to the vending machine and got himself a snack.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d Peter shouted, not to loudly, but enough to get Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony blinked as if he didn\u2019t understand what he was seeing.\u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you meant to be out with your friends?\u201d Oh, so Tony didn\u2019t want him there. Peter tried his best to hide the look of disappointment on his face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to miss anything, and know if Pepper and the baby were alright. Oh and you as well.\u201d Tony smiled at that.</p><p>\u201cPepper and the baby are fine. The baby\u2019s just being a stubborn little shit and is taking a long time to come out. You\u2019d think if it was going to come early, it\u2019d be in a bit more of a hurry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s good.\u201d Peter looked between Tony and May awkwardly. Should he leave now? He\u2019d got what he came for after all and Tony has said it would be a while before the baby was born. Luckily Tony spoke before he had to make his decision.</p><p>\u201cPete&hellip; I just want to say how sorry I am that I missed your graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I understand, this is more important.\u201d Peter tried forget how he\u2019d felt on the stage, seeing that Tony wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to stay, it\u2019s just Happy called me saying Pepper had gone into labour and he was driving her to the hospital and he sounded panicked. I had to come,\u201d Tony rambled, a deep apologetic look spread across his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, really. I\u2019m glad you came here instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill would have liked to see it.\u201d A sad look crossed Tony\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got it all on film,\u201d May interrupted, causing Tony\u2019s face to light up a little. </p><p>\u201cCan you send that to me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course, although perhaps we should wait until the baby\u2019s come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit yeah the baby, I still can\u2019t believe this is actually happening.\u201d There was a slightly panicked look on Tony\u2019s face and Peter chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a great father.\u201d Tony swallowed and the\npanic turned into a far more solemn look, which he quickly tried to hide with a\nclearly forced smile. \u201cNo really, you will be. I mean I\u2019d know since you\u2019re\nbasically like a father to me&hellip;\u201d Peter\u2019s face went bright red as soon as he\nrealised what he\u2019d just said. \u201cI just meant that you\u2019re like a mentor to me and\nyou\u2019ve helped me lots so I know you\u2019re going to do that with your kid too,\ndidn\u2019t mean to be weird or make you uncomfortable.\u201d He tumbled out, keeping his\neyes trained on the floor to avoid Tony\u2019s reaction. It wasn\u2019t until he felt a\npair of arms wrap round him that he again became aware of his surroundings. </p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s so lucky to have such a wonderful big brother.\u201d Tony\npulled in tighter and Peter felt himself lean into the hug, smiling widely. A\nsmall flash in the corner of his eye alerted him to the fact that May had just\ntaken a photo of the two of them. Tony eventually gently pulled out of the hug\nand stood face to face with him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to miss your next graduation. I\ncan promise you that,\u201d he said with such intensity that Peter was left lost for\nwords and simply nodded in response. Tony put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came, but I wasn\u2019t kidding when I said this\nbaby\u2019s taking a while, so you should get back to celebrating with your\nfriends.\u201d Peter could almost feel May\u2019s proud, told-you-so grin that she always\nwore on her face when Tony actually backed up her point. </p><p>\u201cOk, let me know when the baby is born though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the first to know. Well, except Pepper, me, the\ndoctors\u2026 You know what you\u2019ll be the first outside that room to know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come straight away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will. Now I really should be getting back in\nthere. I\u2019ll tell Pepper you were here. That\u2019ll make her happy.\u201d Tony pulled\nPeter into another quick hug before releasing him and heading back through the\nwaiting room doors. May lead Peter out of the hospital before he had a chance\nto change his mind, telling him to text Ned and let him know they we\u2019re coming.</p><p>Once he had arrived at Ned\u2019s he\u2019d instantly been bombarded\nwith questions about the baby and how cute it was, to which Peter had to reply\nthat the baby hadn\u2019t actually been born yet, but he\u2019d be getting a text as soon\nas it happened. It was nice to celebrate with Ned, MJ and their families,\ntalking about going to college next year, speculating on what it would be like,\nbut Peter found himself obsessively checking his phone, in case he\u2019d somehow\nmissed the notification. Each time he found himself disappointed there was\nnothing. As the time passed, the adults got more and more tipsy and began\nmaking heartfelt speeches about how proud of their children they were. Halfway\nthrough May\u2019s speech, after an almost slip up about his nightly activities and\na quick save from Peter, his phone buzzed loudly. </p><p><i>\u2018Baby\u2019s here. Little\ngirl.\u2019 </i>The message read, and Peter couldn\u2019t stop a huge smile from growing\nacross his face. Ned and May both immediately registered what he was so happy\nabout and simply nodded when he said he had to go. Peter didn\u2019t even chance\ninto his suit before swinging through the city towards the hospital. It was a\nlittle risky, being out without the costume in broad daylight, but he was\nmoving too fast for anyone to recognise him and he didn\u2019t want to waste any\ntime. By the time he reached the hospital desk, he was almost completely out of\nbreath.</p><p>\u201cHi, I, uh, I\u2019m Peter Parker, here to see Pepper Potts,\u201d he\nsaid between deep breaths. The receptionist nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr Stark said you\u2019d be coming. They\u2019re in room 12,\njust down the corridor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Peter made his way down the corridor and\nspotted a large 12 on one of the doors. He peered in an saw Tony sitting by\nPepper\u2019s bedside, both with tired, but large grins on their face. He pushed the\ndoor open a little and waved at Tony, whose smile, if possible, grew larger and\nhe gestured for Peter to come in.</p><p>\u201cMeet Morgan Maria Stark.\u201d His eyes moved towards what\nalmost seemed like a tank, inside, the most adorable baby Peter had ever seen,\nwrapped up in a blanket with tiny monitors attached all over her body.</p><p>\u201cIs she ok?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just because she was born a bit early, they need\nto check her out and stuff.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 amazing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, she is.\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I made her.\u201d Pepper\ncoughed indignantly. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t believe Pepper made her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have like 12% of the credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you so much.\u201d Tony leaned in to kiss her and\nPeter grimaced. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are disgusting,\u201d he said, making an exaggerated sick\nmotion. Tony let out a laugh and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOne day this will be you Kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, it will.\u201d Peter tolled his eyes and Tony just shook\nhis head lightly and moved away from Pepper\u2019s side to stand by Peter and\nMorgan. He put his arm round Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have such an amazing family.\u201d His eyes\ndrifted between the three others in the room, filled with overwhelming\nadoration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re luck to have you too,\u201d Peter replied leaning in to\nTony\u2019s embrace. Tony opened his mouth, but Pepper cut in first.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare object to that.\u201d Tony snorted. Peter smiled\nup at him then looked back down to Morgan. She was so much smaller than he\u2019d\never imagined a human could be.

Besides, Tony will text you if anything happens.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut what if he\u2019s too preoccupied with the baby and forgets?\u201d May\u2019s face softens.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to forget. Weren\u2019t you the first one he told?\u201d Peter nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, you should be out celebrating with your friends. I\u2019m sure Tony wouldn\u2019t want you wait here for ages while all your friends were having fun.\u201d Peter lowed his head.</p><p>\u201cJust a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 minutes, okay? Then I\u2019m taking you back to Ned\u2019s.\u201d Peter nodded reluctantly and May smiled. Somehow the time simultaneously passed both too slowly and too quickly for Peter\u2019s liking. The minutes passed, 7, 8, 9\u2026 May looked at him, her face telling him she wouldn\u2019t let him stay any longer. 10. May stood up and gestured for Peter to do the same, but just as he was getting up the door opened and Peter spun around. As if he had been waiting for just the right moment to appear, Tony walked through the door. Seemingly oblivious to everyone else, Tony walked to the vending machine and got himself a snack.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d Peter shouted, not to loudly, but enough to get Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony blinked as if he didn\u2019t understand what he was seeing.\u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you meant to be out with your friends?\u201d Oh, so Tony didn\u2019t want him there. Peter tried his best to hide the look of disappointment on his face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to miss anything, and know if Pepper and the baby were alright. Oh and you as well.\u201d Tony smiled at that.</p><p>\u201cPepper and the baby are fine. The baby\u2019s just being a stubborn little shit and is taking a long time to come out. You\u2019d think if it was going to come early, it\u2019d be in a bit more of a hurry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s good.\u201d Peter looked between Tony and May awkwardly. Should he leave now? He\u2019d got what he came for after all and Tony has said it would be a while before the baby was born. Luckily Tony spoke before he had to make his decision.</p><p>\u201cPete\u2026 I just want to say how sorry I am that I missed your graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I understand, this is more important.\u201d Peter tried forget how he\u2019d felt on the stage, seeing that Tony wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to stay, it\u2019s just Happy called me saying Pepper had gone into labour and he was driving her to the hospital and he sounded panicked. I had to come,\u201d Tony rambled, a deep apologetic look spread across his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, really. I\u2019m glad you came here instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill would have liked to see it.\u201d A sad look crossed Tony\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got it all on film,\u201d May interrupted, causing Tony\u2019s face to light up a little. </p><p>\u201cCan you send that to me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course, although perhaps we should wait until the baby\u2019s come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit yeah the baby, I still can\u2019t believe this is actually happening.\u201d There was a slightly panicked look on Tony\u2019s face and Peter chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a great father.\u201d Tony swallowed and the\npanic turned into a far more solemn look, which he quickly tried to hide with a\nclearly forced smile. \u201cNo really, you will be. I mean I\u2019d know since you\u2019re\nbasically like a father to me\u2026\u201d Peter\u2019s face went bright red as soon as he\nrealised what he\u2019d just said. \u201cI just meant that you\u2019re like a mentor to me and\nyou\u2019ve helped me lots so I know you\u2019re going to do that with your kid too,\ndidn\u2019t mean to be weird or make you uncomfortable.\u201d He tumbled out, keeping his\neyes trained on the floor to avoid Tony\u2019s reaction. It wasn\u2019t until he felt a\npair of arms wrap round him that he again became aware of his surroundings. </p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s so lucky to have such a wonderful big brother.\u201d Tony\npulled in tighter and Peter felt himself lean into the hug, smiling widely. A\nsmall flash in the corner of his eye alerted him to the fact that May had just\ntaken a photo of the two of them. Tony eventually gently pulled out of the hug\nand stood face to face with him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to miss your next graduation. I\ncan promise you that,\u201d he said with such intensity that Peter was left lost for\nwords and simply nodded in response. Tony put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came, but I wasn\u2019t kidding when I said this\nbaby\u2019s taking a while, so you should get back to celebrating with your\nfriends.\u201d Peter could almost feel May\u2019s proud, told-you-so grin that she always\nwore on her face when Tony actually backed up her point. </p><p>\u201cOk, let me know when the baby is born though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the first to know. Well, except Pepper, me, the\ndoctors\u2026 You know what you\u2019ll be the first outside that room to know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come straight away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will. Now I really should be getting back in\nthere. I\u2019ll tell Pepper you were here. That\u2019ll make her happy.\u201d Tony pulled\nPeter into another quick hug before releasing him and heading back through the\nwaiting room doors. May lead Peter out of the hospital before he had a chance\nto change his mind, telling him to text Ned and let him know they we\u2019re coming.</p><p>Once he had arrived at Ned\u2019s he\u2019d instantly been bombarded\nwith questions about the baby and how cute it was, to which Peter had to reply\nthat the baby hadn\u2019t actually been born yet, but he\u2019d be getting a text as soon\nas it happened. It was nice to celebrate with Ned, MJ and their families,\ntalking about going to college next year, speculating on what it would be like,\nbut Peter found himself obsessively checking his phone, in case he\u2019d somehow\nmissed the notification. Each time he found himself disappointed there was\nnothing. As the time passed, the adults got more and more tipsy and began\nmaking heartfelt speeches about how proud of their children they were. Halfway\nthrough May\u2019s speech, after an almost slip up about his nightly activities and\na quick save from Peter, his phone buzzed loudly. </p><p><i>\u2018Baby\u2019s here. Little\ngirl.\u2019 </i>The message read, and Peter couldn\u2019t stop a huge smile from growing\nacross his face. Ned and May both immediately registered what he was so happy\nabout and simply nodded when he said he had to go. Peter didn\u2019t even chance\ninto his suit before swinging through the city towards the hospital. It was a\nlittle risky, being out without the costume in broad daylight, but he was\nmoving too fast for anyone to recognise him and he didn\u2019t want to waste any\ntime. By the time he reached the hospital desk, he was almost completely out of\nbreath.</p><p>\u201cHi, I, uh, I\u2019m Peter Parker, here to see Pepper Potts,\u201d he\nsaid between deep breaths. The receptionist nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr Stark said you\u2019d be coming. They\u2019re in room 12,\njust down the corridor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Peter made his way down the corridor and\nspotted a large 12 on one of the doors. He peered in an saw Tony sitting by\nPepper\u2019s bedside, both with tired, but large grins on their face. He pushed the\ndoor open a little and waved at Tony, whose smile, if possible, grew larger and\nhe gestured for Peter to come in.</p><p>\u201cMeet Morgan Maria Stark.\u201d His eyes moved towards what\nalmost seemed like a tank, inside, the most adorable baby Peter had ever seen,\nwrapped up in a blanket with tiny monitors attached all over her body.</p><p>\u201cIs she ok?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just because she was born a bit early, they need\nto check her out and stuff.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 amazing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, she is.\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I made her.\u201d Pepper\ncoughed indignantly. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t believe Pepper made her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have like 12% of the credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you so much.\u201d Tony leaned in to kiss her and\nPeter grimaced. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are disgusting,\u201d he said, making an exaggerated sick\nmotion. Tony let out a laugh and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOne day this will be you Kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, it will.\u201d Peter tolled his eyes and Tony just shook\nhis head lightly and moved away from Pepper\u2019s side to stand by Peter and\nMorgan. He put his arm round Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have such an amazing family.\u201d His eyes\ndrifted between the three others in the room, filled with overwhelming\nadoration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re luck to have you too,\u201d Peter replied leaning in to\nTony\u2019s embrace. Tony opened his mouth, but Pepper cut in first.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare object to that.\u201d Tony snorted. Peter smiled\nup at him then looked back down to Morgan. She was so much smaller than he\u2019d\never imagined a human could be. He felt an overwhelming urge to pick her up and\nhide her from the world and all the terrible things in it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you Morgan, I promise,\u201d He whispered gently,\nbending down closer to her. He felt Tony do the same next to him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your job kid. Pepper and I will do the protecting.\nYou just get to be her big brother.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBig brother\u2026 I like the sound of that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood, cos you\u2019re gonna be the best big brother in the\nworld.\u201d </p>",

Halfway\nthrough May\u2019s speech, after an almost slip up about his nightly activities and\na quick save from Peter, his phone buzzed loudly. </p><p><i>\u2018Baby\u2019s here. Little\ngirl.\u2019 </i>The message read, and Peter couldn\u2019t stop a huge smile from growing\nacross his face. Ned and May both immediately registered what he was so happy\nabout and simply nodded when he said he had to go. Peter didn\u2019t even chance\ninto his suit before swinging through the city towards the hospital. It was a\nlittle risky, being out without the costume in broad daylight, but he was\nmoving too fast for anyone to recognise him and he didn\u2019t want to waste any\ntime. By the time he reached the hospital desk, he was almost completely out of\nbreath.</p><p>\u201cHi, I, uh, I\u2019m Peter Parker, here to see Pepper Potts,\u201d he\nsaid between deep breaths. The receptionist nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr Stark said you\u2019d be coming. They\u2019re in room 12,\njust down the corridor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Peter made his way down the corridor and\nspotted a large 12 on one of the doors. He peered in an saw Tony sitting by\nPepper\u2019s bedside, both with tired, but large grins on their face. He pushed the\ndoor open a little and waved at Tony, whose smile, if possible, grew larger and\nhe gestured for Peter to come in.</p><p>\u201cMeet Morgan Maria Stark.\u201d His eyes moved towards what\nalmost seemed like a tank, inside, the most adorable baby Peter had ever seen,\nwrapped up in a blanket with tiny monitors attached all over her body.</p><p>\u201cIs she ok?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just because she was born a bit early, they need\nto check her out and stuff.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 amazing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, she is.\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I made her.\u201d Pepper\ncoughed indignantly. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t believe Pepper made her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have like 12% of the credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you so much.\u201d Tony leaned in to kiss her and\nPeter grimaced. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are disgusting,\u201d he said, making an exaggerated sick\nmotion. Tony let out a laugh and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOne day this will be you Kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, it will.\u201d Peter tolled his eyes and Tony just shook\nhis head lightly and moved away from Pepper\u2019s side to stand by Peter and\nMorgan. He put his arm round Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have such an amazing family.\u201d His eyes\ndrifted between the three others in the room, filled with overwhelming\nadoration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re luck to have you too,\u201d Peter replied leaning in to\nTony\u2019s embrace. Tony opened his mouth, but Pepper cut in first.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare object to that.\u201d Tony snorted. Peter smiled\nup at him then looked back down to Morgan. She was so much smaller than he\u2019d\never imagined a human could be. He felt an overwhelming urge to pick her up and\nhide her from the world and all the terrible things in it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you Morgan, I promise,\u201d He whispered gently,\nbending down closer to her. He felt Tony do the same next to him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your job kid. Pepper and I will do the protecting.\nYou just get to be her big brother.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBig brother\u2026 I like the sound of that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood, cos you\u2019re gonna be the best big brother in the\nworld.\u201d </p>",
                "content": "<p><b>A/N: </b><i>so this fic has been in my drafts for ages and I finally decided to finish it! It&rsquo;s also on my ao3 account faldris.</i></p><p>Morgan Stark was born on the day of Peter&rsquo;s graduation. He would be lying if he said that he wasn&rsquo;t devastated when he looked out from the stage and saw Tony&rsquo;s seat empty, but as soon as the ceremony was over and May quickly pulled him aside and said Pepper was having the baby, he couldn&rsquo;t have been happier. He insisted that May drive him to the hospital immediately, despite her saying it could be a long time before the baby was actually born and he should go and celebrate with his friends. Once he was there, he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to see Pepper and Tony, so he patiently sat in the waiting room, staring at the door as if he expected Tony to burst through with a baby in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, you can&rsquo;t just sit here the whole time,&rdquo; May gently said after half an hour of waiting.</p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to miss anything!&rdquo; He gave her his best puppy dog eyes, hoping she wouldn&rsquo;t make him leave.</p><p>&ldquo;These things take time, if I remember correctly your Mum was in the hospital for almost a full 24 hours before you finally came out. Besides, Tony will text you if anything happens.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But what if he&rsquo;s too preoccupied with the baby and forgets?&rdquo; May&rsquo;s face softens.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going to forget. Weren&rsquo;t you the first one he told?&rdquo; Peter nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No buts, you should be out celebrating with your friends. I&rsquo;m sure Tony wouldn&rsquo;t want you wait here for ages while all your friends were having fun.&rdquo; Peter lowed his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a little while longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;10 minutes, okay? Then I&rsquo;m taking you back to Ned&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Peter nodded reluctantly and May smiled. Somehow the time simultaneously passed both too slowly and too quickly for Peter&rsquo;s liking. The minutes passed, 7, 8, 9&hellip; May looked at him, her face telling him she wouldn&rsquo;t let him stay any longer. 10. May stood up and gestured for Peter to do the same, but just as he was getting up the door opened and Peter spun around. As if he had been waiting for just the right moment to appear, Tony walked through the door. Seemingly oblivious to everyone else, Tony walked to the vending machine and got himself a snack.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark!&rdquo; Peter shouted, not to loudly, but enough to get Tony&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Tony blinked as if he didn&rsquo;t understand what he was seeing.&nbsp;&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you meant to be out with your friends?&rdquo; Oh, so Tony didn&rsquo;t want him there. Peter tried his best to hide the look of disappointment on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to miss anything, and know if Pepper and the baby were alright. Oh and you as well.&rdquo; Tony smiled at that.</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper and the baby are fine. The baby&rsquo;s just being a stubborn little shit and is taking a long time to come out. You&rsquo;d think if it was going to come early, it&rsquo;d be in a bit more of a hurry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Peter looked between Tony and May awkwardly. Should he leave now? He&rsquo;d got what he came for after all and Tony has said it would be a while before the baby was born. Luckily Tony spoke before he had to make his decision.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete&hellip; I just want to say how sorry I am that I missed your graduation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I understand, this is more important.&rdquo; Peter tried forget how he&rsquo;d felt on the stage, seeing that Tony wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to stay, it&rsquo;s just Happy called me saying Pepper had gone into labour and he was driving her to the hospital and he sounded panicked. I had to come,&rdquo; Tony rambled, a deep apologetic look spread across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok, really. I&rsquo;m glad you came here instead.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Still would have liked to see it.&rdquo; A sad look crossed Tony&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve got it all on film,&rdquo; May interrupted, causing Tony&rsquo;s face to light up a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you send that to me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course, although perhaps we should wait until the baby&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit yeah the baby, I still can&rsquo;t believe this is actually happening.&rdquo; There was a slightly panicked look on Tony&rsquo;s face and Peter chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be a great father.&rdquo; Tony swallowed and the\npanic turned into a far more solemn look, which he quickly tried to hide with a\nclearly forced smile. &ldquo;No really, you will be. I mean I&rsquo;d know since you&rsquo;re\nbasically like a father to me&hellip;&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s face went bright red as soon as he\nrealised what he&rsquo;d just said. &ldquo;I just meant that you&rsquo;re like a mentor to me and\nyou&rsquo;ve helped me lots so I know you&rsquo;re going to do that with your kid too,\ndidn&rsquo;t mean to be weird or make you uncomfortable.&rdquo; He tumbled out, keeping his\neyes trained on the floor to avoid Tony&rsquo;s reaction. It wasn&rsquo;t until he felt a\npair of arms wrap round him that he again became aware of his surroundings. </p><p>&ldquo;The baby&rsquo;s so lucky to have such a wonderful big brother.&rdquo; Tony\npulled in tighter and Peter felt himself lean into the hug, smiling widely. A\nsmall flash in the corner of his eye alerted him to the fact that May had just\ntaken a photo of the two of them. Tony eventually gently pulled out of the hug\nand stood face to face with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to miss your next graduation. I\ncan promise you that,&rdquo; he said with such intensity that Peter was left lost for\nwords and simply nodded in response. Tony put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came, but I wasn&rsquo;t kidding when I said this\nbaby&rsquo;s taking a while, so you should get back to celebrating with your\nfriends.&rdquo; Peter could almost feel May&rsquo;s proud, told-you-so grin that she always\nwore on her face when Tony actually backed up her point. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok, let me know when the baby is born though.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the first to know. Well, except Pepper, me, the\ndoctors&hellip; You know what you&rsquo;ll be the first outside that room to know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come straight away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you will. Now I really should be getting back in\nthere. I&rsquo;ll tell Pepper you were here. That&rsquo;ll make her happy.&rdquo; Tony pulled\nPeter into another quick hug before releasing him and heading back through the\nwaiting room doors. May lead Peter out of the hospital before he had a chance\nto change his mind, telling him to text Ned and let him know they we&rsquo;re coming.</p><p>Once he had arrived at Ned&rsquo;s he&rsquo;d instantly been bombarded\nwith questions about the baby and how cute it was, to which Peter had to reply\nthat the baby hadn&rsquo;t actually been born yet, but he&rsquo;d be getting a text as soon\nas it happened. It was nice to celebrate with Ned, MJ and their families,\ntalking about going to college next year, speculating on what it would be like,\nbut Peter found himself obsessively checking his phone, in case he&rsquo;d somehow\nmissed the notification.
