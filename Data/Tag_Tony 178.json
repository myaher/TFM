You&rsquo;d think it would be easy, seeing as they have known these people for years and that they are practically family now but, it&rsquo;s really not.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god, oh god!&rdquo; A stressed Wanda said as she paced around the bedroom, (Y/N) was sitting on on the bed, leaning back on her palms with her head moving with Wanda as she paced around the room. &ldquo;I was so confident yesterday that this would all turn out okay, but now i&rsquo;m having all these thoughts and different outcomes of what could happen poping up in my mind!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay Wanda.&rdquo; (Y/N) reassured Wanda as she stood up from the bed and walked up to Wanda before gently grabbing her shoulders, &ldquo;Wanda look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda looked up into (Y/N)&rsquo;s (E/C) eye&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Everything will be okay, if they don&rsquo;t except us for who we are and that we love each other then i&rsquo;ll personally go down there and kick their ass&rsquo;s so hard that they&rsquo;ll end up in Central Park.&rdquo; (Y/N) says with a chuckle. Wanda giggled, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wanna do it now and get it over with or do it later at when we&rsquo;re all having dinner?&rdquo; (Y/N) said looking down at Wanda with love in her eyes, &ldquo;At dinner,&rdquo; Wanda replyed looking up at (Y/N) with confidence now in her dark brown eyes and a smile on her face. &ldquo;Thanks for calming me down (Y/N). You&rsquo;re the best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; (Y/N) said with a cheeky smirk on her face as moved her hands up to Wanda&rsquo;s face and placing a lingering kiss on her lips. The kiss was interrupted by a knock on the door, &ldquo;Hey guys dinners ready!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo;</p><p><b>-Time skip to dinner-</b></p><p>Wanda and (Y/N) were hoping that dinner would just go by smoothly but nobody ever gets a happy ending do they?</p><p>&ldquo;So we um&hellip;actually have something to um..t-tell you guys.&rdquo; Wanda said nervously, clenching and unclenching her hands under the table. (Y/N) reached under the table and grabbed her shaking hand, to help her calm down.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure what is it-&rdquo; Steve said before getting cut off.</p><p>&ldquo;(L/N)!&rdquo; Fury&rsquo;s voice filled the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir?&rdquo; (Y/N) replyed looking up from her seat at the dinner table only to see the director in all of his glory. </p><p>&ldquo;I need to speak with you outside for a moment.&rdquo; (Y/N) squeezed Wanda&rsquo;s hand before standing up and walking out of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;What were you saying Wanda?&rdquo; Steve asked kindly. He was always like a father to Wanda and she a daughter to him. &ldquo;I-I ummm&hellip;&rdquo; Wanda replyed looking at everyone. They all had kind looks on their faces as they waited for Wanda to continue what&rsquo;s she was saying, &ldquo;You okay Wanda?&rdquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Now or never&rsquo; she thought as she closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She opened her eyes before she finally said it, &ldquo;(Y/N) and I are in a relationship together.&rdquo;</p><p><b>(Y/N)&rsquo;s POV</b></p><p>I walked out of the room with Fury, I stopped and turned to face him, &ldquo;You needed to speak to me sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We need you in New Mexico.&rdquo; He stated</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked with a confused look on my face. Suddenly Fury got quiet, &ldquo;I heard about you and Wanda.&rdquo; </p><p>'Oh god..&rsquo; I thought before he continued, &ldquo;And I also know that you guys were gonna tell everyone today, so I thought if things went south you and Wanda could have a little vacation in New Mexico, while I talk to everyone and set them straight about your relationship with Wanda.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow. Thank you Fury that&rsquo;s amaz-&rdquo; I was cut off by yelling in the kitchen, &ldquo;WHAT!?&rdquo;, &ldquo;YOU CANT BE SERIOUS!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; I mumbled as I ran back with Fury into the kitchen only to see a very scared looking Wanda and very angry looking Avengers.</p><p>&ldquo;DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THE MEDIA IS GONNA TAKE THIS IF IT GETS OUT TO THE WORLD!?&rdquo; Tony yelled at Wanda while everyone else agreed, by this time she was tearing up.</p><p>I ran over to Wanda, &ldquo;You okay baby?&rdquo; </p><p>She quickly got up and hugged me, burying her head in my shoulder, I hugged back and talked to her in her mind to her, 'Fury is sending us to New Mexico for a little vacation. He knew about us and he set it up for us incase thing go south.&rsquo; 'Really?&rsquo; 'Really, really. Now why don&rsquo;t you go pack and I&rsquo;ll deal with these fuckers.&rsquo; She giggled out loud with a smile before she left the kitchen. </p><p>&ldquo;Now&hellip;Where do we wanna start?&rdquo; I said as I turned to the group with a glare. Now I don&rsquo;t get angry a lot, but right now I&rsquo;m fucking pissed.</p><p>&ldquo;When were you gonna tell us!&rdquo; Clint asked leaning forward on the table with his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;We were hoping to tell you guys right now, together Barton.&rdquo; I snaped back leaning forward on the table with my hands, trying to mimic him.</p><p>&ldquo;WHAT ABOUT THE MEDIA!? IF THEY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY&rsquo;D DO!?&rdquo; Tony screamed at me pointing an accusing finger at me.</p><p>&ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T CARE ABOUT THE MEDIA! I DON&rsquo;T CARE ABOUT THEIR OPINIONS! AND HONESTLY I DON&rsquo;T CARE ABOUT YOURS EITHER STARK! I LOVE WANDA AND NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE THAT! ESPECIALLY, NOT A ROOM FULL OF JACKASS&rsquo;S WHO I THOUGHT WERE MY FRIENDS!&rdquo; I screamed back, everyone was shocked to say the least, even Fury was surprised. &ldquo;Me and Wanda are gonna be gone for a while, were going to New Mexico while Fury sets you guys straight about my relationship with Wanda.&rdquo; I say with a glare before walking out of the room, I stop next to Fury, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready in 30 Fury.&rdquo;</p></p>",

In the distance, above Time Square, fireworks are being set off, lighting the night sky with an assault of bright colors. Peter is soon by her side, the two <i>ooh-</i>\u00a0and <i>ahh-</i>ing at every spark.

Cameron sits close to the other boy, shyly running his fingers over the top of his hand. Daniel notices and gently takes his hand, giving a reassuring squeeze and smile.

Daniel taps his shoulder to get his attention, and Cameron doesn\u2019t hesitate to look in his direction.</p><p><i>Happy New Year.</i></p><!-- more --><p>Cameron smiles and mirrors him. <i>Happy New Year.</i> In the background, Peter and Diana are counting down at the top of their lungs. Mr. Stark, Aunt May, and Bea start toasting their glasses as the year comes to a close and a new one begins. The excitement in the room only adds to the chaos of Cameron\u2019s beating heart, and he can\u2019t take his eyes off of Daniel, the fireworks reflecting off his glasses and illuminating his face. The small smile, his parted lips, and the short chuckle from Diana and Peter\u2019s over-the-top excitement as the clock strikes midnight make his emotions overflow and his head spin. Daniel looks at him and flashes a grin, the joy from the others infectious.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Cam-\u201d</p><p>Cameron can\u2019t control himself, and soon he\u2019s leaning forward, his lips practically collide with Daniel\u2019s. The taller boy has to use both of his hands to keep them steady, digging his fingers into the carpet as Cameron presses more and more into him, wanting to be engulfed in him, wanting to <i>fuse</i> with him. At first the kiss is sloppy, uncoordinated, but Cameron can feel Daniel\u2019s lips try to find a rhythm with his, and soon they\u2019re kissing effortlessly. Cameron can feel Daniel moan into the kiss, and soon his hand is on his cheek, pulling him closer, their jaws moving simultaneously, like they were <i>meant</i> for each other. They part for air, Cameron releases a shaky breath, and Daniel sits back to take it all in.</p><p>Cameron keeps his eyes closed, too lost in the moment, and leans in for a round two but isn\u2019t reciprocated. His eyes open slowly and he sees Daniel\u2026 absolutely stunned. His eyes, so beautiful and easy to get lost in, are wide and full of\u2026 Shock? Surprise? His thin lips, so wonderful to kiss and Cameron\u2019s waited so long to feel them, are pressed into a line. Cameron\u2019s scared that he\u2019s lost him and waves his hands in front of his face in an attempt to bring him back from whatever dimension he\u2019s gone to, from whatever thought he\u2019s lost in.</p><p>Suddenly Daniel is standing, his eyes fixed nowhere in particular but not looking at Cameron. <i>Bathroom.</i> The sign is so fast that Cameron barely recognizes it, and soon he\u2019s met with Daniel\u2019s back, his slim body walking away from him towards the hallway. Cameron turns around to see that no one\u2019s noticed, all too preoccupied with conversation while Diana and Peter set off celebratory poppers back and forth. He quietly sneaks away in pursuit of Daniel, who God knows what is going through his mind.</p><p>Cameron wanders down the hallway aimlessly until he notices the light in the bathroom is on. He approaches the door, hesitantly lifts his hand, and knocks softly. He waits a while, and when there\u2019s no response or sign of the door opening, he lifts his hand to knock again. As he brings his knuckles down to rap against the soft wood, the door suddenly swings open, and his hand is hovered over Daniel\u2019s hoodie-clad chest. Surprised, he reels back and looks up to find Daniel\u2019s face. Water drips from stands of his hair, and his cheeks look softer. He must have just washed his face, Cameron assumes.</p><p><i>Sorry.</i> It\u2019s the first thing Daniel signs, and there is regret in his eyes. Cameron feels worry curl in his nerves.</p><p><i>Are you okay?</i> Cameron\u2019s worried that maybe Daniel wasn\u2019t ready and he\u2019s invaded his privacy in some way. <i>I\u2019m sorry if I surprised you. I\u2019ve just wanted to kiss you for a while, and I thought it was the right time.</i></p><p>Daniel\u2019s mouth gapes in surprise, opening and closing like a fish. He fumbles with his hands, not sure what to sign, his brows furrowed and lips pressed together in confusion. <i>You wanted to kiss me? You like me?</i></p><p>Cameron is taken by surprise. He thought that was pretty obvious. <i>Yeah? I thought we\u2019ve been dating for a while now.</i> Daniel\u2019s mouth hangs open, and Cameron can\u2019t believe how dense this boy is. <i>I\u2019ve liked you since I first met you, Daniel. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have assumed we were dating, but I thought it was pretty obvious.</i> Daniel blushes and fumbles with the strings of his hoodie. Cameron smiles and steps closer, though his body trembles as nervousness rushes through his body. <i>Do you like me?</i></p><p>Now Daniel gets defensive. <i>Of course I like you! I-</i> His face might as well be on fire, and Cameron can\u2019t help but find him absolutely adorable. <i>I\u2019ve liked you for a while too.</i> The confession is shy, the signs fast and nearly jumbled together in one big mess. Cameron exhales relief and closes the distance between them, his hand resting on Daniel\u2019s chest. He relaxes as he feels Daniel\u2019s hand play with his hair. <i>I really like you.</i> Their eyes meet and soon they\u2019re kissing again, gentle and light but passionate. Daniel\u2019s fingers rake through Cameron\u2019s hair, his other hand resting on the small of his back. Cameron\u2019s hands find Daniel\u2019s shoulders, holding onto him as if his life depended on it.</p><p>For once in his life, Daniel feels safe. The thoughts, all the negative ones, stop and all he can think about is kissing Cameron, and how nice he feels, how nice <i>this</i> feels. The warmth swirling his stomach, his hands on Cameron and Cameron\u2019s hands on him. He wants this, and Cameron wants it too. Cameron wants <i>him.</i> Daniel pulls apart from the kiss and embraces Cameron, holding him so close as if he would disappear if he let him go, as if he\u2019s the only thing holding him on to this earth. He feels Cameron\u2019s hands rest on his back, gently rubbing his shoulder blades, until one of his hands firmly press into his back. Daniel clings onto the fabric of Cameron\u2019s shirt, pulling him even closer, and Cameron\u2019s hand presses even further into the cloth of Daniel\u2019s hoodie.</p><p>Pressed into his back is the international sign for <i>I love you</i>, and Cameron\u2019s trying to let him know even though he can\u2019t see. <i>I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you.</i></p><p>Daniel\u2019s body trembles with an overwhelming feeling of joy, joy of being alive, of being here, of being here with <i>Cameron</i>, of Cameron loving <i>him-</i></p><p>His hand shakily forms, thumb out, index and pinky fingers up, pressing into Cameron\u2019s back.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p>",

In the distance, above Time Square, fireworks are being set off, lighting the night sky with an assault of bright colors. Peter is soon by her side, the two <i>ooh-</i>\u00a0and <i>ahh-</i>ing at every spark.

Daniel taps his shoulder to get his attention, and Cameron doesn\u2019t hesitate to look in his direction.</p><p><i>Happy New Year.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Cameron smiles and mirrors him. <i>Happy New Year.</i> In the background, Peter and Diana are counting down at the top of their lungs. Mr. Stark, Aunt May, and Bea start toasting their glasses as the year comes to a close and a new one begins. The excitement in the room only adds to the chaos of Cameron\u2019s beating heart, and he can\u2019t take his eyes off of Daniel, the fireworks reflecting off his glasses and illuminating his face. The small smile, his parted lips, and the short chuckle from Diana and Peter\u2019s over-the-top excitement as the clock strikes midnight make his emotions overflow and his head spin. Daniel looks at him and flashes a grin, the joy from the others infectious.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Cam-\u201d</p><p>Cameron can\u2019t control himself, and soon he\u2019s leaning forward, his lips practically collide with Daniel\u2019s. The taller boy has to use both of his hands to keep them steady, digging his fingers into the carpet as Cameron presses more and more into him, wanting to be engulfed in him, wanting to <i>fuse</i> with him. At first the kiss is sloppy, uncoordinated, but Cameron can feel Daniel\u2019s lips try to find a rhythm with his, and soon they\u2019re kissing effortlessly. Cameron can feel Daniel moan into the kiss, and soon his hand is on his cheek, pulling him closer, their jaws moving simultaneously, like they were <i>meant</i> for each other. They part for air, Cameron releases a shaky breath, and Daniel sits back to take it all in.</p><p>Cameron keeps his eyes closed, too lost in the moment, and leans in for a round two but isn\u2019t reciprocated. His eyes open slowly and he sees Daniel\u2026 absolutely stunned. His eyes, so beautiful and easy to get lost in, are wide and full of\u2026 Shock? Surprise? His thin lips, so wonderful to kiss and Cameron\u2019s waited so long to feel them, are pressed into a line. Cameron\u2019s scared that he\u2019s lost him and waves his hands in front of his face in an attempt to bring him back from whatever dimension he\u2019s gone to, from whatever thought he\u2019s lost in.</p><p>Suddenly Daniel is standing, his eyes fixed nowhere in particular but not looking at Cameron. <i>Bathroom.</i> The sign is so fast that Cameron barely recognizes it, and soon he\u2019s met with Daniel\u2019s back, his slim body walking away from him towards the hallway. Cameron turns around to see that no one\u2019s noticed, all too preoccupied with conversation while Diana and Peter set off celebratory poppers back and forth. He quietly sneaks away in pursuit of Daniel, who God knows what is going through his mind.</p><p>Cameron wanders down the hallway aimlessly until he notices the light in the bathroom is on. He approaches the door, hesitantly lifts his hand, and knocks softly. He waits a while, and when there\u2019s no response or sign of the door opening, he lifts his hand to knock again. As he brings his knuckles down to rap against the soft wood, the door suddenly swings open, and his hand is hovered over Daniel\u2019s hoodie-clad chest. Surprised, he reels back and looks up to find Daniel\u2019s face. Water drips from stands of his hair, and his cheeks look softer. He must have just washed his face, Cameron assumes.</p><p><i>Sorry.</i> It\u2019s the first thing Daniel signs, and there is regret in his eyes. Cameron feels worry curl in his nerves.</p><p><i>Are you okay?</i> Cameron\u2019s worried that maybe Daniel wasn\u2019t ready and he\u2019s invaded his privacy in some way. <i>I\u2019m sorry if I surprised you. I\u2019ve just wanted to kiss you for a while, and I thought it was the right time.</i></p><p>Daniel\u2019s mouth gapes in surprise, opening and closing like a fish. He fumbles with his hands, not sure what to sign, his brows furrowed and lips pressed together in confusion. <i>You wanted to kiss me? You like me?</i></p><p>Cameron is taken by surprise. He thought that was pretty obvious. <i>Yeah? I thought we\u2019ve been dating for a while now.</i> Daniel\u2019s mouth hangs open, and Cameron can\u2019t believe how dense this boy is. <i>I\u2019ve liked you since I first met you, Daniel. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have assumed we were dating, but I thought it was pretty obvious.</i> Daniel blushes and fumbles with the strings of his hoodie. Cameron smiles and steps closer, though his body trembles as nervousness rushes through his body. <i>Do you like me?</i></p><p>Now Daniel gets defensive. <i>Of course I like you!

We practically bought out the\nrestaurant to cover all of the cravings of my very lovely pregnant wife.\u201d</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t kidding. \nPeering inside the box, Peter found enough take-out boxes to feed three\ntimes as many people as there were in the apartment. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlus I wanted you guys to be able to get some crab cheese wontons\nwithout losing a limb,\u201d Tony said simply as he took off his sunglasses.</p><p>Ned and Peter snickered until Pepper narrowed her eyes at\nher husband. \u00a0\u201cWhat have I said about\nmaking fun of my cravings?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Shut up before I rip your arm off?\u2019\u201d</p><p>When Pepper nodded, Tony then quietly said to the boys,\n\u201cSee? Loss of limbs.\u201d</p><p>May led Pepper to the living room, taking her coat and\npurse. \u00a0\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Pepper grinned, sitting on the couch. \u00a0She settled her hands over her cute little\nbaby bump. \u00a0\u201cMorgan is an active little\nguy.\u201d</p><p>May smiled. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll\neat here in the living room. \u00a0Peter and\nNed, can you bring the food, and I\u2019ll get the drinks.\u201d</p><p>Peter stepped in the kitchen while May was filling glasses\nwith root beer. \u00a0\u201cWhat are they doing\nhere?\u201d he whispered, a touch of anxiety in his question. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI invited them,\u201d May answered simply.</p><p>\u201cI know, but why?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, Tony called from the living room,\n\u201cSo what are we watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStar Wars!\u201d Ned said happily. \u00a0\u201cWe watch A New Hope and time the movie so\nthe Death Star blows up at the stroke of midnight.\u201d</p><p>Much to Peter\u2019s frustration, May left the kitchen to serve\ndrinks before she answered Peter\u2019s question. \n\u201cThe boys have added Rogue One to tonight\u2019s viewing lineup.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fathom why she invited the Starks to their\nlittle New Year\u2019s Eve celebration. First, Peter figured Pepper and Tony would\nhave been at a swanky and hip Manhattan\nparty. \u00a0But, he knew May never cared for\nTony; she voiced her dislike about Tony when Peter talked about his\n\u201cinternship.\u201d</p><p>Then she found out Peter was Spider-Man and Tony was\nresponsible for building not one, but two suits. \u00a0Peter stayed with Tony through the final\nbattle with Thanos, post being released from the Soul Stone; the move nearly\ngot Peter killed permanently. \u00a0And now\nTony was his mentor as Peter finished his senior year of high school. \u00a0Peter spent a lot of late nights at Tony\u2019s\nworkshop, meaning he didn\u2019t see May nearly as much. </p><p>\u00a0With all of this, he couldn\u2019t imagine why May wanted Tony in\nher home. \u00a0Swallowing hard, Peter\nwondered if this would be the night May would tell Tony to stay away from her\nnephew.</p><hr><p>Forty-five minutes later, Peter still couldn\u2019t get over the\nfact he was sitting on the floor in his living room on New Year\u2019s Eve with Tony\nStark and Pepper Potts, eating Chinese food and watching Rogue One.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you guys been doing this?\u201d Pepper asked.</p><p>Peter thought for a moment. \n\u201cUh, ever since I lived with Uncle Ben and Aunt May. \u00a0Uncle Ben was a big Star Wars fan.\u201d \u00a0May smiled at him, and he didn\u2019t miss the\nsheen in her eyes.</p><p>It had been their New Year\u2019s Eve tradition to watch the\nOriginal Trilogy. \u00a0When Peter was ten, he\nand Uncle Ben had figured out when to start A New Hope to where the Death Star\nblew up right at midnight. \u00a0That year,\nthe three of them cheered like they were Rebels at that climatic moment.</p><p>But the first New Year\u2019s Eve after Uncle Ben died, Peter was\ninvited to a party at Abe\u2019s house. \u00a0The\nidea of leaving May alone that night\u2026just made Peter feel sick inside. \u00a0So he\u2019d told Ned he was staying with May, and\nNed joined them as well. \u00a0The tradition\nstayed alive with the three of them.</p><p>\u201cWe used to always watch the movies in order,\u201d Peter went\non. \u00a0\u201cBut then we discovered it was more\nfun to watch A New Hope closer to midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys will continue to watch the rest of the Original\nTrilogy after midnight, but don\u2019t feel obligated to stay for that,\u201d May said.</p><p>\u201cBut so we\u2019re not waiting until 10:02, we start with Rogue\nOne now,\u201d Ned happily explained. \u00a0\u201cWe\nkeep everything in order.\u201d</p><p>When the Rebels had successfully gotten the Death Star plans\nto Princess Leia, the little group had enough time before the next movie\nstarted to stretch, use the bathroom, and refresh drinks and food</p><p>At exactly 10:02:43, Peter began A New Hope. \u00a0When the Rebels were setting up for the\ninvasion of the stormtroopers, Tony offhandedly commented, \u201cYou know, I\nremember when Dad got a phone call from George Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!?!\u201d Peter and Ned exclaimed at the same time.</p><p>Swallowing a sip of root beer, Tony nodded. \u00a0\u201cYeah, George Lucas spoke to Dad about some\nof the weapons design for the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Ned asked, his eyes wide and unflinching.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Lucas. Your dad knew George Lucas.\u201d \u00a0Peter could not believe his ears. \u00a0How the hell did he not know this??</p><p>\u201cGeorge even gave Dad tickets to the movie premiere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!?!?\u201d</p><p>Pepper laughed. \n\u201cBaby, you can\u2019t casually drop bombs like that to two Star Wars fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when Dad got home from his meeting with\nGeorge. \u00a0He thought the plot of the movie\nwas the silliest thing he\u2019d ever heard. \nAfter we got home from the movie, Dad said George was the real genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>George</i>,\u201d Ned\npractically squealed. \u00a0\u201cYou call him\nGeorge and actually know the man. \u00a0Do you\nstill talk to him?\u201d</p><p>Peter fired out, \u201cDid Howard help with the design of the\nDeath Star too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid <i>you</i> help with\nthe design of the Death Star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make a blaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make a lightsaber?\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed. \u00a0\u201cThat\nwas actually the one weapon Dad was curious about making. \u00a0I think he tried designing something for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he manage to make one?\u201d Peter asked excitedly.</p><p>Tony shook his head. \n\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter deflated for a second before grinning at Ned. \u00a0\u201cI bet Shuri could make one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuri could totally make a lightsaber,\u201d Ned agreed with a\nmassive smile.</p><p>May shook her head. \n\u201cNo, no, no. \u00a0You are not asking\nShuri to make you a lightsaber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter protested. \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like our apartment, and I don\u2019t want you to\ndestroy everything with a laser sword.\u201d</p><p>Peter scoffed. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot like we\u2019d be using it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, boys,\u201d Tony agreed, swiping his smartphone\nscreen. \u00a0\u201cNo lightsabers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes for you too,\u201d Pepper said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>She pointed to his phone. \u00a0\u201cI know you are about to text Shuri and you do\nnot need a lightsaber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, Pepper shook her head. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t even have time to explain to you all\nof the reasons you shouldn\u2019t have a functioning lightsaber.\u201d \u00a0She scooted to the end of the couch cushion,\nand Tony jumped to his feet to help her up. \n\u201cNo lightsaber.\u201d</p><p>After she left for the bathroom, Tony leaned down to Peter\nand Ned and spoke to where Aunt May couldn\u2019t hear him. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll call Shuri later this week.\u201d \u00a0Peter and Ned nodded eagerly, sharing their\nsignature handshake. \u00a0When Pepper\nrejoined them, Tony winked at the boys.</p><hr><p>The rest of the city was counting down to the New Year as\nHan Solo said, \u201cYou\u2019re all clear, kid. Now let\u2019s blow this thing and go home.\u201d \u00a0But no one in the apartment joined in.</p><p>Peter and Ned stared at the TV screen with the same wide\neyed wonder as they had every time they watched this movie. \u00a0The thrill of watching the Rebels win this\nmajor battle never got old.</p><p>And when the Death Star met its inventible end, everyone\nerupted into cheers. \u00a0Leaning down, May\nsmacked a kiss on Peter\u2019s cheek before she did the same to Ned. \u00a0Out of the corner of his eye, Peter caught\nTony and Pepper in their own kiss. \nAfter, Tony bent his head to press his lips to Pepper\u2019s baby bump. \u00a0Peter couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sweet\ngesture.</p><p>After they toasted with sparkling apple cider, Tony and\nPepper gave their goodbyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for having us,\u201d Pepper hugged Peter\nbefore kissing his cheek. \u00a0Peter\u2019s face\nburned with embarrassment. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he squeaked.</p><p>Tony pulled Peter into a hug, giving him a friendly clap on\nthe back. \u00a0\u201cThis was fun, kid. \u00a0You and Ned enjoy the rest of the trilogy.\u201d</p><p>After they left, Ned went back to the living room to set up\nThe Empire Strikes Back. \u00a0May told them\nshe was turning in. \u00a0Before she could\nleave, Peter asked, \u201cSo why did you invite them?\u201d</p><p>May\u2019s eyes softened. \n\u201cI know how much you look up to Tony. \nAnd I admit I haven\u2019t been the most welcoming to him. \u00a0He\u2019s an important part of your life and I\nwanted to get to know him better.\u201d \u00a0She\ncupped his cheek. \u00a0\u201cI know I can\u2019t\nprovide you with everything, but I am so happy you have a positive male figure\nin your life again.\u201d</p><p>Blinking back his own tears, Peter\u2019s chest flooded with\njoyous warmth. \u00a0He wrapped May up in a\nbone crushing hug. \u00a0For probably the\nmillionth time, he was so, so grateful to have Aunt May.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby.\u201d \n</p>",

We practically bought out the\nrestaurant to cover all of the cravings of my very lovely pregnant wife.\u201d</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t kidding. \nPeering inside the box, Peter found enough take-out boxes to feed three\ntimes as many people as there were in the apartment. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlus I wanted you guys to be able to get some crab cheese wontons\nwithout losing a limb,\u201d Tony said simply as he took off his sunglasses.</p><p>Ned and Peter snickered until Pepper narrowed her eyes at\nher husband. \u00a0\u201cWhat have I said about\nmaking fun of my cravings?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Shut up before I rip your arm off?\u2019\u201d</p><p>When Pepper nodded, Tony then quietly said to the boys,\n\u201cSee?

First, Peter figured Pepper and Tony would\nhave been at a swanky and hip Manhattan\nparty. \u00a0But, he knew May never cared for\nTony; she voiced her dislike about Tony when Peter talked about his\n\u201cinternship.\u201d</p><p>Then she found out Peter was Spider-Man and Tony was\nresponsible for building not one, but two suits. \u00a0Peter stayed with Tony through the final\nbattle with Thanos, post being released from the Soul Stone; the move nearly\ngot Peter killed permanently. \u00a0And now\nTony was his mentor as Peter finished his senior year of high school. \u00a0Peter spent a lot of late nights at Tony\u2019s\nworkshop, meaning he didn\u2019t see May nearly as much. </p><p>\u00a0With all of this, he couldn\u2019t imagine why May wanted Tony in\nher home. \u00a0Swallowing hard, Peter\nwondered if this would be the night May would tell Tony to stay away from her\nnephew.</p><hr><p>Forty-five minutes later, Peter still couldn\u2019t get over the\nfact he was sitting on the floor in his living room on New Year\u2019s Eve with Tony\nStark and Pepper Potts, eating Chinese food and watching Rogue One.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you guys been doing this?\u201d Pepper asked.</p><p>Peter thought for a moment. \n\u201cUh, ever since I lived with Uncle Ben and Aunt May. \u00a0Uncle Ben was a big Star Wars fan.\u201d \u00a0May smiled at him, and he didn\u2019t miss the\nsheen in her eyes.</p><p>It had been their New Year\u2019s Eve tradition to watch the\nOriginal Trilogy. \u00a0When Peter was ten, he\nand Uncle Ben had figured out when to start A New Hope to where the Death Star\nblew up right at midnight. \u00a0That year,\nthe three of them cheered like they were Rebels at that climatic moment.</p><p>But the first New Year\u2019s Eve after Uncle Ben died, Peter was\ninvited to a party at Abe\u2019s house. \u00a0The\nidea of leaving May alone that night\u2026just made Peter feel sick inside. \u00a0So he\u2019d told Ned he was staying with May, and\nNed joined them as well. \u00a0The tradition\nstayed alive with the three of them.</p><p>\u201cWe used to always watch the movies in order,\u201d Peter went\non. \u00a0\u201cBut then we discovered it was more\nfun to watch A New Hope closer to midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys will continue to watch the rest of the Original\nTrilogy after midnight, but don\u2019t feel obligated to stay for that,\u201d May said.</p><p>\u201cBut so we\u2019re not waiting until 10:02, we start with Rogue\nOne now,\u201d Ned happily explained. \u00a0\u201cWe\nkeep everything in order.\u201d</p><p>When the Rebels had successfully gotten the Death Star plans\nto Princess Leia, the little group had enough time before the next movie\nstarted to stretch, use the bathroom, and refresh drinks and food</p><p>At exactly 10:02:43, Peter began A New Hope. \u00a0When the Rebels were setting up for the\ninvasion of the stormtroopers, Tony offhandedly commented, \u201cYou know, I\nremember when Dad got a phone call from George Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!?!\u201d Peter and Ned exclaimed at the same time.</p><p>Swallowing a sip of root beer, Tony nodded. \u00a0\u201cYeah, George Lucas spoke to Dad about some\nof the weapons design for the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Ned asked, his eyes wide and unflinching.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Lucas. Your dad knew George Lucas.\u201d \u00a0Peter could not believe his ears. \u00a0How the hell did he not know this??</p><p>\u201cGeorge even gave Dad tickets to the movie premiere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!?!?\u201d</p><p>Pepper laughed. \n\u201cBaby, you can\u2019t casually drop bombs like that to two Star Wars fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when Dad got home from his meeting with\nGeorge. \u00a0He thought the plot of the movie\nwas the silliest thing he\u2019d ever heard. \nAfter we got home from the movie, Dad said George was the real genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>George</i>,\u201d Ned\npractically squealed. \u00a0\u201cYou call him\nGeorge and actually know the man. \u00a0Do you\nstill talk to him?\u201d</p><p>Peter fired out, \u201cDid Howard help with the design of the\nDeath Star too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid <i>you</i> help with\nthe design of the Death Star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make a blaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make a lightsaber?\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed. \u00a0\u201cThat\nwas actually the one weapon Dad was curious about making. \u00a0I think he tried designing something for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he manage to make one?\u201d Peter asked excitedly.</p><p>Tony shook his head. \n\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter deflated for a second before grinning at Ned. \u00a0\u201cI bet Shuri could make one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuri could totally make a lightsaber,\u201d Ned agreed with a\nmassive smile.</p><p>May shook her head. \n\u201cNo, no, no. \u00a0You are not asking\nShuri to make you a lightsaber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter protested. \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like our apartment, and I don\u2019t want you to\ndestroy everything with a laser sword.\u201d</p><p>Peter scoffed. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot like we\u2019d be using it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, boys,\u201d Tony agreed, swiping his smartphone\nscreen. \u00a0\u201cNo lightsabers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes for you too,\u201d Pepper said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>She pointed to his phone. \u00a0\u201cI know you are about to text Shuri and you do\nnot need a lightsaber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, Pepper shook her head. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t even have time to explain to you all\nof the reasons you shouldn\u2019t have a functioning lightsaber.\u201d \u00a0She scooted to the end of the couch cushion,\nand Tony jumped to his feet to help her up. \n\u201cNo lightsaber.\u201d</p><p>After she left for the bathroom, Tony leaned down to Peter\nand Ned and spoke to where Aunt May couldn\u2019t hear him. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll call Shuri later this week.\u201d \u00a0Peter and Ned nodded eagerly, sharing their\nsignature handshake. \u00a0When Pepper\nrejoined them, Tony winked at the boys.</p><hr><p>The rest of the city was counting down to the New Year as\nHan Solo said, \u201cYou\u2019re all clear, kid. Now let\u2019s blow this thing and go home.\u201d \u00a0But no one in the apartment joined in.</p><p>Peter and Ned stared at the TV screen with the same wide\neyed wonder as they had every time they watched this movie. \u00a0The thrill of watching the Rebels win this\nmajor battle never got old.</p><p>And when the Death Star met its inventible end, everyone\nerupted into cheers. \u00a0Leaning down, May\nsmacked a kiss on Peter\u2019s cheek before she did the same to Ned. \u00a0Out of the corner of his eye, Peter caught\nTony and Pepper in their own kiss. \nAfter, Tony bent his head to press his lips to Pepper\u2019s baby bump. \u00a0Peter couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sweet\ngesture.</p><p>After they toasted with sparkling apple cider, Tony and\nPepper gave their goodbyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for having us,\u201d Pepper hugged Peter\nbefore kissing his cheek. \u00a0Peter\u2019s face\nburned with embarrassment. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he squeaked.</p><p>Tony pulled Peter into a hug, giving him a friendly clap on\nthe back. \u00a0\u201cThis was fun, kid. \u00a0You and Ned enjoy the rest of the trilogy.\u201d</p><p>After they left, Ned went back to the living room to set up\nThe Empire Strikes Back. \u00a0May told them\nshe was turning in. \u00a0Before she could\nleave, Peter asked, \u201cSo why did you invite them?\u201d</p><p>May\u2019s eyes softened. \n\u201cI know how much you look up to Tony. \nAnd I admit I haven\u2019t been the most welcoming to him. \u00a0He\u2019s an important part of your life and I\nwanted to get to know him better.\u201d \u00a0She\ncupped his cheek. \u00a0\u201cI know I can\u2019t\nprovide you with everything, but I am so happy you have a positive male figure\nin your life again.\u201d</p><p>Blinking back his own tears, Peter\u2019s chest flooded with\njoyous warmth. \u00a0He wrapped May up in a\nbone crushing hug. \u00a0For probably the\nmillionth time, he was so, so grateful to have Aunt May.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby.\u201d \n</p>",
