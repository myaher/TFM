He\u2019s like the ultimate helicopter dad, and yeah maybe sometimes it\u2019s annoying, but he just loves them so much and wants to protect them and if any of his kids ever need his help, even if they\u2019re on the other side of Westeros, he\u2019ll be there.

        "body": "<p>Purely brandrick fluff based on a great idea from <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP8rkkR9WJFrgJZHRLaCPog\">@this-is-not-what-i-expect</a></p><p>Pod likes to draw Bran. Bran thinks he\u2019s cute.</p><p>Read it on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19130860\">AO3</a></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time since Podrick had been able to draw. He\u2019d spent years away from the relative comfort of Kings Landing, travelling and fighting for what felt like an eternity. His whole life had revolved around being a squire, training, learning to become a knight, it was almost difficult to remember a time when he held anything other than a sword.</p><p><br/></p><!-- more --><p>Now, the wars have all been won and he\u2019s back in Kings Landing. Ser Podrick Payne of the Kingsguard. Brienne told him it had a nice ring to it. He agreed.</p><p>Serving King Bran is the highest honour he could imagine. He hadn\u2019t thought of joining the goldcloaks, not until that day in the dragon pit when Bran was chosen as their next king. Podrick had no real love for Robert Baratheon, certainly not enough to devote his life to protecting him, and he\u2019d have sooner taken the black and lived his days freezing up on the wall than have to take orders from the monster that was King Joffrey.</p><p>But he\u2019d met Bran up North in Winterfell, and instantly knew he was nothing like most Westerosi men. The level of calm he exuded was almost frightening at first but after talking to him more he saw the warmth and gentleness underneath the intense stare. He enjoyed spending his time with Bran, he was more interesting to Podrick than so many of the others. He had no interest in arbitrary politics or worrying about the inevitable. He\u2019d find Bran sat in the godswood, or by the fire inside, or the courtyard watching everyone prepare for battle, and he\u2019d sit by his side and ask what he could see. Bran always humoured him with stories about pirates from Pentos, or dornishmen battling on the southern beaches. Realistically Pod knows it was all to humour him, to take his mind off of the fight that was steadily approaching, but he didn\u2019t mind. He likes to think it comforted Bran as well, giving him something to focus on that wasn\u2019t the burden of being the three eyed raven -and what a burden it was.</p><p>It was the night before the Battle of Winterfell that Pod had asked him what it actually meant to be the three eyed raven. The explanation he got was tricky to follow and didn\u2019t make much sense, but Bran\u2019s words stuck with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m swimming in the sea, but instead of water, I\u2019m hit by wave after wave of memories. Everything that ever happened to anyone washing over me constantly. At first it was like a storm, never letting up, no direction to it - I was bombarded with boundless knowledge.\u201d An almost pained look took over his face then.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m so surrounded by everyone else\u2019s memories, it\u2019s hard to remember who I am, where I\u2019ve been, what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m getting better at controlling it now, like the water\u2019s stilling, and I can finally choose where to look.\u201d He\u2019d said, voice hardly more than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to remember myself. You know I wasn\u2019t always this boring, Podrick.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been a twinkle in his eye then, though it quickly disappeared back to the usual blank stare; he imagined that was a glimpse of the Bran Stark that had lived in the halls of Winterfell in years gone by. His fingers had itched for paper, some way to capture the flash in those eyes that was so rare to see, but instead they found a dragonglass blade and spent the following hours confronting the dead.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The first time he drew Bran was the day after he had been crowned. \u2018Bran the Broken\u2019 Tyrion had called him, though Pod disputed that somewhat. Bran hadn\u2019t ever seemed broken to him, even more so now with his newly made crown on his head. Bran was anything but broken - he looked whole. He recognised a look in the young King\u2019s eyes that he\u2019d seen that night in Winterfell, like he\u2019d finally come back to himself. Once he\u2019d taken the King to his chambers and helped him to bed, he couldn\u2019t resist immortalising that look with a sketch of Bran, crown on his head, eyes sparkling with the promise of just leadership. That drawing holds a special place in Pod\u2019s heart, as it sparks a habit he\u2019s soon unable to break.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>He draws Bran again a few weeks later. They\u2019d been walking through the gardens and Bran had asked him to stop next to a bush of bright blue flowers; Pod recognised them as winter roses. Bran didn\u2019t have to say anything to let Podrick know he\u2019s thinking of home. Winterfell in the snow. His sisters, the Queen in the North and the explorer. His brother, now one of the Free Folk. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll see them again anytime soon. Bran turned and looked at Pod then, silhouetted by the winter roses, a bittersweet smile on his face. That image is one Pod couldn\u2019t help but put to memory, and when he returned to his room later that day he didn\u2019t even remove his armour before he\u2019s sketching away. This drawing has a special place in his collection as it\u2019s the first he added colour to, the frosty blue making a perfect contrast with the King\u2019s ivory skin and dark hair.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>When Bran\u2019s hair starts to grow, Podrick nearly uses up all the paper in the capital.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Podrick\u2019s favourite drawing of Bran is probably the most intimate. It\u2019d been a long day, meeting with the small council, seeing Lords and Ladies from all over the Six Kingdoms, a trip down the the harbour with Ser Davos to deal with some sort of ship emergency Pod doesn\u2019t quite pay attention to. By the time he\u2019s escorting Bran back to his chambers, he\u2019s almost asleep in his chair. Pod helps him change, and Bran\u2019s barely conscious enough to lift his own arms, his eyes dropping every few seconds. He lifts the king into his bed, covering him with the soft blankets, then turns to go. Before he can however, Bran, eyes still closed, reached out for his arm and pulls him towards him.</p><p>\u201cPodrick?\u201d He whispers, voice croaky from tiredness.</p><p>\u201cYes Bran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay? Until I fall asleep?\u201d Bran opens his eyes then, silently pleading. Podrick\u2019s helpless to resist that look.</p><p>\u201cOf course Your Grace.\u201d He says, climbing onto the bed next to Bran.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you to stop calling me that, Pod.\u201d Bran groans, taking hold of Pod\u2019s arm and pulling to close to himself as he settles down into the bed, already drifting off to sleep.</p><p>He lies with his head on the pillow for what could be minutes, could be hours, Pod doesn\u2019t know, just watching Bran fall into a deep sleep. His hair, now brushing his shoulders, is fanned around him against the pillow like a dark halo. His eyelashes look criminally long where they brush against his ever pale cheeks. Pod catalogues every detail of the King\u2019s beautiful face, and when he finally slips out of the room back to his own, he replicates it all perfectly. It\u2019s vulnerable and intimate and Bran, their godly, omniscient King, looks so shockingly human.</p><p>Pod thinks he might be just a little bit in love.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>In hindsight, it was silly of him to think he could have any secrets from Bran. He\u2019s so different now from when they first met that Pod sometimes forgets he\u2019s still the three eyed raven, now he\u2019s just Bran Stark as well. Bran can see everything so Pod\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s so shocked when Bran turns to him one day as they\u2019re sat reading together in the King\u2019s chamber and says, \u201cSo when are you going to show me your drawings of me?\u201d</p><p>Pod chokes on air, and feels himself flush bright red. He panics, worrying that Bran will be angry with him, that he\u2019ll be sent away from the kingsguard and have to flee to Essos for harassing the King of the Six Kingdoms, and jumps up to apologise.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you, I won\u2019t do it ever again, if you want someone else as your guard I completely understand, I\u2019ll ask Brienne to post me elsewhere in the city-\u201c</p><p>Bran watches him ramble nervously for a moment, an amused smile inching across his face, before he stops Pod with a raised hand.</p><p>\u201cFirstly Pod, you haven\u2019t called me \u2018Your Grace\u2019 in months, please don\u2019t start doing it again.\u201d</p><p>Pod nods furiously, stood before Bran with his eyes downcast, like a child being chastised.</p><p>\u201cSecondly, I never said I was offended. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m flattered.\u201d At that Pod raises his eyes to shyly look at Bran.</p><p>\u201cF-flattered?\u201d He stammers.</p><p>\u201cOf course Pod,\u201d Bran replies, smiling kindly. \u201cI only want to know, why do you like drawing me so much?\u201d</p><p>Pod blushes with embarrassment once more, but he can\u2019t lie to Bran.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Bran.\u201d Pod says quietly, looking into his King\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Brans cheeks flush lightly at that, and he fights off a small smile, before steeling himself.</p><p>\u201cCome here Pod.\u201d He says flatly, but he can\u2019t help a hint of a smirk playing on his lips. Pod hurries closer to Bran, kneeling down in front of his chair, looking up at Bran expectantly.</p><p>Bran doesn\u2019t say anything, he just slides a hand around the back of Pod\u2019s neck, pulling him so they\u2019re face to face, only a hairsbreadth apart. For a moment they stay there, looking into each other eyes, before Bran moves his hand up into Pod\u2019s hair and joins their lips together.</p><p>Podrick melts into the kiss, moving one hand to grip Bran\u2019s free one, and his other to cup his cheek gently. The kiss is soft and sweet and so Bran and Podrick. When they break apart, they press their foreheads together, giggling gingerly.</p><p>\u201cSo does this mean you\u2019ll pose for me next time I want to draw you?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>They keep it between themselves for a long time. Podrick shows Bran all of the drawings he\u2019s done of him; Bran blushes and pretends he isn\u2019t melting at how sweet Podrick is.</p><p>Now that Bran knows, Pod starts carrying his drawing things with him when they go out, and his collection grows exponentially. He\u2019s forever stopping Bran, telling him not to move as he starts sketching. Bran, in appropriate fashion, pretends to be endlessly frustrated by Pod\u2019s insistence.</p><p>They also grow closer and closer as time goes by, spending almost every moment of the day together. More often than not Bran will ask Podrick to stay with him when he goes to bed, and who is Pod to say no to his King? Endless nights are spend cuddled together, arms around each other, heads burrowed in shoulders, and gentle kisses exchanged until sleep takes them both.</p><p>No one suspects a thing, or so they\u2019d choose to believe, until it comes time for Bran to have a portrait painted of him. Tyrion finds supposedly the best artist in the capital, but when the painting\u2019s unveiled to the small council, there\u2019s something off with it.</p><p>They stand around staring at it, Tyrion humming thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2026 captures you, Your Grace.\u201d He says, after a time.</p><p>Davos scoffs, \u201cIt looks nothin\u2019 like him!\u201d</p><p>Bran knows they\u2019re right. The artistry is beautiful, there\u2019s no denying it, but it\u2019s not quite the amazing depiction of him they\u2019d all hoped for.</p><p>\u201cWell, nothin\u2019 to be done about it now,\u201d Bronn interjects, \u201cShe was the best artist in the six bloody kingdoms, no ones gonna do a better job.\u201d</p><p>The council hum their agreement, but still eye the painting with slight distaste. Bran turns to Podrick, who smiles gently at him as if to cheer him up. That gives Bran an idea.</p><p>\u201cI know someone who could,\u201d he announces, \u201cPaint a better portrait, that is.\u201d, he clarifies when he\u2019s met with confused glances. \u201cOur very own Ser Podrick. He\u2019s captured my face brilliantly countless times, I don\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t again.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion sends Pod off to collect a sample of his drawings, and when he returns, he takes a seat next to Bran, who takes his hand discreetly, squeezing it reassuringly while they\u2019re all stood around admiring Pod\u2019s work, Brienne and Davos occasionally casting knowing looks their way.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tyrion says after a while, \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve found someone to paint our King\u2019s new portrait.\u201d He shoots Pod a proud smile, before bowing to Bran and leaving the room.</p><p>Everyone begins to file out, Bronn unsuccessfully attempting to sneak out a handful of Pod\u2019s drawings to sell in the city. Brienne gives Pod a squeeze on the shoulder as she leaves, wearing a small grin on her face.</p><p>When they\u2019re finally left alone, Pod pulls Bran close to him, hugging him tight.</p><p>\u201cThank you, I hope I don\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d He says softly in Bran\u2019s ear.</p><p>Bran pulls back, holding Podrick by the shoulder to look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou could never disappoint me Podrick.\u201d He says earnestly. He pulls Pod in for a quick kiss, which turns into another, and another, until their lips have been locked together for a fair few minutes. Studying Bran\u2019s features, the ones he knows so well now and has recreated on paper countless times - the curve of his nose, the shape of his eyes, the v of his Cupid\u2019s bow- he can\u2019t hold himself back.</p><p>\u201cI love you Bran,\u201d he says, \u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>Bran\u2019s eyes soften, and he pecks Podrick on the forehead sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Podrick. More than you can know.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>If Brienne, Davos, and Tyrion are all watching through the door they never mention it.

He\u2019d spent years away from the relative comfort of Kings Landing, travelling and fighting for what felt like an eternity. His whole life had revolved around being a squire, training, learning to become a knight, it was almost difficult to remember a time when he held anything other than a sword.</p><p><br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Now, the wars have all been won and he\u2019s back in Kings Landing. Ser Podrick Payne of the Kingsguard. Brienne told him it had a nice ring to it. He agreed.</p><p>Serving King Bran is the highest honour he could imagine. He hadn\u2019t thought of joining the goldcloaks, not until that day in the dragon pit when Bran was chosen as their next king. Podrick had no real love for Robert Baratheon, certainly not enough to devote his life to protecting him, and he\u2019d have sooner taken the black and lived his days freezing up on the wall than have to take orders from the monster that was King Joffrey.</p><p>But he\u2019d met Bran up North in Winterfell, and instantly knew he was nothing like most Westerosi men. The level of calm he exuded was almost frightening at first but after talking to him more he saw the warmth and gentleness underneath the intense stare. He enjoyed spending his time with Bran, he was more interesting to Podrick than so many of the others. He had no interest in arbitrary politics or worrying about the inevitable. He\u2019d find Bran sat in the godswood, or by the fire inside, or the courtyard watching everyone prepare for battle, and he\u2019d sit by his side and ask what he could see. Bran always humoured him with stories about pirates from Pentos, or dornishmen battling on the southern beaches. Realistically Pod knows it was all to humour him, to take his mind off of the fight that was steadily approaching, but he didn\u2019t mind. He likes to think it comforted Bran as well, giving him something to focus on that wasn\u2019t the burden of being the three eyed raven -and what a burden it was.</p><p>It was the night before the Battle of Winterfell that Pod had asked him what it actually meant to be the three eyed raven. The explanation he got was tricky to follow and didn\u2019t make much sense, but Bran\u2019s words stuck with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m swimming in the sea, but instead of water, I\u2019m hit by wave after wave of memories. Everything that ever happened to anyone washing over me constantly. At first it was like a storm, never letting up, no direction to it - I was bombarded with boundless knowledge.\u201d An almost pained look took over his face then.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m so surrounded by everyone else\u2019s memories, it\u2019s hard to remember who I am, where I\u2019ve been, what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m getting better at controlling it now, like the water\u2019s stilling, and I can finally choose where to look.\u201d He\u2019d said, voice hardly more than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to remember myself. You know I wasn\u2019t always this boring, Podrick.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been a twinkle in his eye then, though it quickly disappeared back to the usual blank stare; he imagined that was a glimpse of the Bran Stark that had lived in the halls of Winterfell in years gone by. His fingers had itched for paper, some way to capture the flash in those eyes that was so rare to see, but instead they found a dragonglass blade and spent the following hours confronting the dead.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The first time he drew Bran was the day after he had been crowned. \u2018Bran the Broken\u2019 Tyrion had called him, though Pod disputed that somewhat. Bran hadn\u2019t ever seemed broken to him, even more so now with his newly made crown on his head. Bran was anything but broken - he looked whole. He recognised a look in the young King\u2019s eyes that he\u2019d seen that night in Winterfell, like he\u2019d finally come back to himself. Once he\u2019d taken the King to his chambers and helped him to bed, he couldn\u2019t resist immortalising that look with a sketch of Bran, crown on his head, eyes sparkling with the promise of just leadership. That drawing holds a special place in Pod\u2019s heart, as it sparks a habit he\u2019s soon unable to break.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>He draws Bran again a few weeks later. They\u2019d been walking through the gardens and Bran had asked him to stop next to a bush of bright blue flowers; Pod recognised them as winter roses. Bran didn\u2019t have to say anything to let Podrick know he\u2019s thinking of home. Winterfell in the snow. His sisters, the Queen in the North and the explorer. His brother, now one of the Free Folk. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll see them again anytime soon. Bran turned and looked at Pod then, silhouetted by the winter roses, a bittersweet smile on his face. That image is one Pod couldn\u2019t help but put to memory, and when he returned to his room later that day he didn\u2019t even remove his armour before he\u2019s sketching away. This drawing has a special place in his collection as it\u2019s the first he added colour to, the frosty blue making a perfect contrast with the King\u2019s ivory skin and dark hair.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>When Bran\u2019s hair starts to grow, Podrick nearly uses up all the paper in the capital.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Podrick\u2019s favourite drawing of Bran is probably the most intimate. It\u2019d been a long day, meeting with the small council, seeing Lords and Ladies from all over the Six Kingdoms, a trip down the the harbour with Ser Davos to deal with some sort of ship emergency Pod doesn\u2019t quite pay attention to. By the time he\u2019s escorting Bran back to his chambers, he\u2019s almost asleep in his chair. Pod helps him change, and Bran\u2019s barely conscious enough to lift his own arms, his eyes dropping every few seconds. He lifts the king into his bed, covering him with the soft blankets, then turns to go. Before he can however, Bran, eyes still closed, reached out for his arm and pulls him towards him.</p><p>\u201cPodrick?\u201d He whispers, voice croaky from tiredness.</p><p>\u201cYes Bran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay? Until I fall asleep?\u201d Bran opens his eyes then, silently pleading. Podrick\u2019s helpless to resist that look.</p><p>\u201cOf course Your Grace.\u201d He says, climbing onto the bed next to Bran.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you to stop calling me that, Pod.\u201d Bran groans, taking hold of Pod\u2019s arm and pulling to close to himself as he settles down into the bed, already drifting off to sleep.</p><p>He lies with his head on the pillow for what could be minutes, could be hours, Pod doesn\u2019t know, just watching Bran fall into a deep sleep. His hair, now brushing his shoulders, is fanned around him against the pillow like a dark halo. His eyelashes look criminally long where they brush against his ever pale cheeks. Pod catalogues every detail of the King\u2019s beautiful face, and when he finally slips out of the room back to his own, he replicates it all perfectly. It\u2019s vulnerable and intimate and Bran, their godly, omniscient King, looks so shockingly human.</p><p>Pod thinks he might be just a little bit in love.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>In hindsight, it was silly of him to think he could have any secrets from Bran. He\u2019s so different now from when they first met that Pod sometimes forgets he\u2019s still the three eyed raven, now he\u2019s just Bran Stark as well. Bran can see everything so Pod\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s so shocked when Bran turns to him one day as they\u2019re sat reading together in the King\u2019s chamber and says, \u201cSo when are you going to show me your drawings of me?\u201d</p><p>Pod chokes on air, and feels himself flush bright red. He panics, worrying that Bran will be angry with him, that he\u2019ll be sent away from the kingsguard and have to flee to Essos for harassing the King of the Six Kingdoms, and jumps up to apologise.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you, I won\u2019t do it ever again, if you want someone else as your guard I completely understand, I\u2019ll ask Brienne to post me elsewhere in the city-\u201c</p><p>Bran watches him ramble nervously for a moment, an amused smile inching across his face, before he stops Pod with a raised hand.</p><p>\u201cFirstly Pod, you haven\u2019t called me \u2018Your Grace\u2019 in months, please don\u2019t start doing it again.\u201d</p><p>Pod nods furiously, stood before Bran with his eyes downcast, like a child being chastised.</p><p>\u201cSecondly, I never said I was offended. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m flattered.\u201d At that Pod raises his eyes to shyly look at Bran.</p><p>\u201cF-flattered?\u201d He stammers.</p><p>\u201cOf course Pod,\u201d Bran replies, smiling kindly. \u201cI only want to know, why do you like drawing me so much?\u201d</p><p>Pod blushes with embarrassment once more, but he can\u2019t lie to Bran.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Bran.\u201d Pod says quietly, looking into his King\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Brans cheeks flush lightly at that, and he fights off a small smile, before steeling himself.</p><p>\u201cCome here Pod.\u201d He says flatly, but he can\u2019t help a hint of a smirk playing on his lips. Pod hurries closer to Bran, kneeling down in front of his chair, looking up at Bran expectantly.</p><p>Bran doesn\u2019t say anything, he just slides a hand around the back of Pod\u2019s neck, pulling him so they\u2019re face to face, only a hairsbreadth apart. For a moment they stay there, looking into each other eyes, before Bran moves his hand up into Pod\u2019s hair and joins their lips together.</p><p>Podrick melts into the kiss, moving one hand to grip Bran\u2019s free one, and his other to cup his cheek gently. The kiss is soft and sweet and so Bran and Podrick. When they break apart, they press their foreheads together, giggling gingerly.</p><p>\u201cSo does this mean you\u2019ll pose for me next time I want to draw you?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>They keep it between themselves for a long time. Podrick shows Bran all of the drawings he\u2019s done of him; Bran blushes and pretends he isn\u2019t melting at how sweet Podrick is.</p><p>Now that Bran knows, Pod starts carrying his drawing things with him when they go out, and his collection grows exponentially. He\u2019s forever stopping Bran, telling him not to move as he starts sketching. Bran, in appropriate fashion, pretends to be endlessly frustrated by Pod\u2019s insistence.</p><p>They also grow closer and closer as time goes by, spending almost every moment of the day together.

He\u2019d spent years away from the relative comfort of Kings Landing, travelling and fighting for what felt like an eternity. His whole life had revolved around being a squire, training, learning to become a knight, it was almost difficult to remember a time when he held anything other than a sword.</p><p><br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Now, the wars have all been won and he\u2019s back in Kings Landing. Ser Podrick Payne of the Kingsguard. Brienne told him it had a nice ring to it. He agreed.</p><p>Serving King Bran is the highest honour he could imagine. He hadn\u2019t thought of joining the goldcloaks, not until that day in the dragon pit when Bran was chosen as their next king. Podrick had no real love for Robert Baratheon, certainly not enough to devote his life to protecting him, and he\u2019d have sooner taken the black and lived his days freezing up on the wall than have to take orders from the monster that was King Joffrey.</p><p>But he\u2019d met Bran up North in Winterfell, and instantly knew he was nothing like most Westerosi men. The level of calm he exuded was almost frightening at first but after talking to him more he saw the warmth and gentleness underneath the intense stare. He enjoyed spending his time with Bran, he was more interesting to Podrick than so many of the others. He had no interest in arbitrary politics or worrying about the inevitable. He\u2019d find Bran sat in the godswood, or by the fire inside, or the courtyard watching everyone prepare for battle, and he\u2019d sit by his side and ask what he could see. Bran always humoured him with stories about pirates from Pentos, or dornishmen battling on the southern beaches. Realistically Pod knows it was all to humour him, to take his mind off of the fight that was steadily approaching, but he didn\u2019t mind. He likes to think it comforted Bran as well, giving him something to focus on that wasn\u2019t the burden of being the three eyed raven -and what a burden it was.</p><p>It was the night before the Battle of Winterfell that Pod had asked him what it actually meant to be the three eyed raven. The explanation he got was tricky to follow and didn\u2019t make much sense, but Bran\u2019s words stuck with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m swimming in the sea, but instead of water, I\u2019m hit by wave after wave of memories. Everything that ever happened to anyone washing over me constantly. At first it was like a storm, never letting up, no direction to it - I was bombarded with boundless knowledge.\u201d An almost pained look took over his face then.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m so surrounded by everyone else\u2019s memories, it\u2019s hard to remember who I am, where I\u2019ve been, what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m getting better at controlling it now, like the water\u2019s stilling, and I can finally choose where to look.\u201d He\u2019d said, voice hardly more than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to remember myself. You know I wasn\u2019t always this boring, Podrick.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been a twinkle in his eye then, though it quickly disappeared back to the usual blank stare; he imagined that was a glimpse of the Bran Stark that had lived in the halls of Winterfell in years gone by. His fingers had itched for paper, some way to capture the flash in those eyes that was so rare to see, but instead they found a dragonglass blade and spent the following hours confronting the dead.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The first time he drew Bran was the day after he had been crowned. \u2018Bran the Broken\u2019 Tyrion had called him, though Pod disputed that somewhat. Bran hadn\u2019t ever seemed broken to him, even more so now with his newly made crown on his head. Bran was anything but broken - he looked whole. He recognised a look in the young King\u2019s eyes that he\u2019d seen that night in Winterfell, like he\u2019d finally come back to himself. Once he\u2019d taken the King to his chambers and helped him to bed, he couldn\u2019t resist immortalising that look with a sketch of Bran, crown on his head, eyes sparkling with the promise of just leadership. That drawing holds a special place in Pod\u2019s heart, as it sparks a habit he\u2019s soon unable to break.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>He draws Bran again a few weeks later. They\u2019d been walking through the gardens and Bran had asked him to stop next to a bush of bright blue flowers; Pod recognised them as winter roses. Bran didn\u2019t have to say anything to let Podrick know he\u2019s thinking of home. Winterfell in the snow. His sisters, the Queen in the North and the explorer. His brother, now one of the Free Folk. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll see them again anytime soon. Bran turned and looked at Pod then, silhouetted by the winter roses, a bittersweet smile on his face. That image is one Pod couldn\u2019t help but put to memory, and when he returned to his room later that day he didn\u2019t even remove his armour before he\u2019s sketching away. This drawing has a special place in his collection as it\u2019s the first he added colour to, the frosty blue making a perfect contrast with the King\u2019s ivory skin and dark hair.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>When Bran\u2019s hair starts to grow, Podrick nearly uses up all the paper in the capital.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Podrick\u2019s favourite drawing of Bran is probably the most intimate. It\u2019d been a long day, meeting with the small council, seeing Lords and Ladies from all over the Six Kingdoms, a trip down the the harbour with Ser Davos to deal with some sort of ship emergency Pod doesn\u2019t quite pay attention to. By the time he\u2019s escorting Bran back to his chambers, he\u2019s almost asleep in his chair. Pod helps him change, and Bran\u2019s barely conscious enough to lift his own arms, his eyes dropping every few seconds. He lifts the king into his bed, covering him with the soft blankets, then turns to go. Before he can however, Bran, eyes still closed, reached out for his arm and pulls him towards him.</p><p>\u201cPodrick?\u201d He whispers, voice croaky from tiredness.</p><p>\u201cYes Bran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay? Until I fall asleep?\u201d Bran opens his eyes then, silently pleading. Podrick\u2019s helpless to resist that look.</p><p>\u201cOf course Your Grace.\u201d He says, climbing onto the bed next to Bran.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you to stop calling me that, Pod.\u201d Bran groans, taking hold of Pod\u2019s arm and pulling to close to himself as he settles down into the bed, already drifting off to sleep.</p><p>He lies with his head on the pillow for what could be minutes, could be hours, Pod doesn\u2019t know, just watching Bran fall into a deep sleep. His hair, now brushing his shoulders, is fanned around him against the pillow like a dark halo. His eyelashes look criminally long where they brush against his ever pale cheeks. Pod catalogues every detail of the King\u2019s beautiful face, and when he finally slips out of the room back to his own, he replicates it all perfectly. It\u2019s vulnerable and intimate and Bran, their godly, omniscient King, looks so shockingly human.</p><p>Pod thinks he might be just a little bit in love.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>In hindsight, it was silly of him to think he could have any secrets from Bran. He\u2019s so different now from when they first met that Pod sometimes forgets he\u2019s still the three eyed raven, now he\u2019s just Bran Stark as well. Bran can see everything so Pod\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s so shocked when Bran turns to him one day as they\u2019re sat reading together in the King\u2019s chamber and says, \u201cSo when are you going to show me your drawings of me?\u201d</p><p>Pod chokes on air, and feels himself flush bright red. He panics, worrying that Bran will be angry with him, that he\u2019ll be sent away from the kingsguard and have to flee to Essos for harassing the King of the Six Kingdoms, and jumps up to apologise.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you, I won\u2019t do it ever again, if you want someone else as your guard I completely understand, I\u2019ll ask Brienne to post me elsewhere in the city-\u201c</p><p>Bran watches him ramble nervously for a moment, an amused smile inching across his face, before he stops Pod with a raised hand.</p><p>\u201cFirstly Pod, you haven\u2019t called me \u2018Your Grace\u2019 in months, please don\u2019t start doing it again.\u201d</p><p>Pod nods furiously, stood before Bran with his eyes downcast, like a child being chastised.</p><p>\u201cSecondly, I never said I was offended. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m flattered.\u201d At that Pod raises his eyes to shyly look at Bran.</p><p>\u201cF-flattered?\u201d He stammers.</p><p>\u201cOf course Pod,\u201d Bran replies, smiling kindly. \u201cI only want to know, why do you like drawing me so much?\u201d</p><p>Pod blushes with embarrassment once more, but he can\u2019t lie to Bran.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Bran.\u201d Pod says quietly, looking into his King\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Brans cheeks flush lightly at that, and he fights off a small smile, before steeling himself.</p><p>\u201cCome here Pod.\u201d He says flatly, but he can\u2019t help a hint of a smirk playing on his lips. Pod hurries closer to Bran, kneeling down in front of his chair, looking up at Bran expectantly.</p><p>Bran doesn\u2019t say anything, he just slides a hand around the back of Pod\u2019s neck, pulling him so they\u2019re face to face, only a hairsbreadth apart. For a moment they stay there, looking into each other eyes, before Bran moves his hand up into Pod\u2019s hair and joins their lips together.</p><p>Podrick melts into the kiss, moving one hand to grip Bran\u2019s free one, and his other to cup his cheek gently. The kiss is soft and sweet and so Bran and Podrick. When they break apart, they press their foreheads together, giggling gingerly.</p><p>\u201cSo does this mean you\u2019ll pose for me next time I want to draw you?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>They keep it between themselves for a long time. Podrick shows Bran all of the drawings he\u2019s done of him; Bran blushes and pretends he isn\u2019t melting at how sweet Podrick is.</p><p>Now that Bran knows, Pod starts carrying his drawing things with him when they go out, and his collection grows exponentially. He\u2019s forever stopping Bran, telling him not to move as he starts sketching. Bran, in appropriate fashion, pretends to be endlessly frustrated by Pod\u2019s insistence.</p><p>They also grow closer and closer as time goes by, spending almost every moment of the day together. More often than not Bran will ask Podrick to stay with him when he goes to bed, and who is Pod to say no to his King? Endless nights are spend cuddled together, arms around each other, heads burrowed in shoulders, and gentle kisses exchanged until sleep takes them both.</p><p>No one suspects a thing, or so they\u2019d choose to believe, until it comes time for Bran to have a portrait painted of him. Tyrion finds supposedly the best artist in the capital, but when the painting\u2019s unveiled to the small council, there\u2019s something off with it.</p><p>They stand around staring at it, Tyrion humming thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2026 captures you, Your Grace.\u201d He says, after a time.</p><p>Davos scoffs, \u201cIt looks nothin\u2019 like him!\u201d</p><p>Bran knows they\u2019re right. The artistry is beautiful, there\u2019s no denying it, but it\u2019s not quite the amazing depiction of him they\u2019d all hoped for.</p><p>\u201cWell, nothin\u2019 to be done about it now,\u201d Bronn interjects, \u201cShe was the best artist in the six bloody kingdoms, no ones gonna do a better job.\u201d</p><p>The council hum their agreement, but still eye the painting with slight distaste. Bran turns to Podrick, who smiles gently at him as if to cheer him up. That gives Bran an idea.</p><p>\u201cI know someone who could,\u201d he announces, \u201cPaint a better portrait, that is.\u201d, he clarifies when he\u2019s met with confused glances. \u201cOur very own Ser Podrick. He\u2019s captured my face brilliantly countless times, I don\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t again.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion sends Pod off to collect a sample of his drawings, and when he returns, he takes a seat next to Bran, who takes his hand discreetly, squeezing it reassuringly while they\u2019re all stood around admiring Pod\u2019s work, Brienne and Davos occasionally casting knowing looks their way.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tyrion says after a while, \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve found someone to paint our King\u2019s new portrait.\u201d He shoots Pod a proud smile, before bowing to Bran and leaving the room.</p><p>Everyone begins to file out, Bronn unsuccessfully attempting to sneak out a handful of Pod\u2019s drawings to sell in the city. Brienne gives Pod a squeeze on the shoulder as she leaves, wearing a small grin on her face.</p><p>When they\u2019re finally left alone, Pod pulls Bran close to him, hugging him tight.</p><p>\u201cThank you, I hope I don\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d He says softly in Bran\u2019s ear.</p><p>Bran pulls back, holding Podrick by the shoulder to look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou could never disappoint me Podrick.\u201d He says earnestly. He pulls Pod in for a quick kiss, which turns into another, and another, until their lips have been locked together for a fair few minutes. Studying Bran\u2019s features, the ones he knows so well now and has recreated on paper countless times - the curve of his nose, the shape of his eyes, the v of his Cupid\u2019s bow- he can\u2019t hold himself back.</p><p>\u201cI love you Bran,\u201d he says, \u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>Bran\u2019s eyes soften, and he pecks Podrick on the forehead sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Podrick. More than you can know.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>If Brienne, Davos, and Tyrion are all watching through the door they never mention it. Nor do they mention the tears they all have to mop up before they head off to complete their duties.</p>",

As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m flattered.&rdquo; At that Pod raises his eyes to shyly look at Bran.</p><p>&ldquo;F-flattered?&rdquo; He stammers.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course Pod,&rdquo; Bran replies, smiling kindly. &ldquo;I only want to know, why do you like drawing me so much?&rdquo;</p><p>Pod blushes with embarrassment once more, but he can&rsquo;t lie to Bran.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful, Bran.&rdquo; Pod says quietly, looking into his King&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>Brans cheeks flush lightly at that, and he fights off a small smile, before steeling himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here Pod.&rdquo; He says flatly, but he can&rsquo;t help a hint of a smirk playing on his lips. Pod hurries closer to Bran, kneeling down in front of his chair, looking up at Bran expectantly.</p><p>Bran doesn&rsquo;t say anything, he just slides a hand around the back of Pod&rsquo;s neck, pulling him so they&rsquo;re face to face, only a hairsbreadth apart. For a moment they stay there, looking into each other eyes, before Bran moves his hand up into Pod&rsquo;s hair and joins their lips together.</p><p>Podrick melts into the kiss, moving one hand to grip Bran&rsquo;s free one, and his other to cup his cheek gently. The kiss is soft and sweet and so Bran and Podrick. When they break apart, they press their foreheads together, giggling gingerly.</p><p>&ldquo;So does this mean you&rsquo;ll pose for me next time I want to draw you?&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>They keep it between themselves for a long time. Podrick shows Bran all of the drawings he&rsquo;s done of him; Bran blushes and pretends he isn&rsquo;t melting at how sweet Podrick is.</p><p>Now that Bran knows, Pod starts carrying his drawing things with him when they go out, and his collection grows exponentially. He&rsquo;s forever stopping Bran, telling him not to move as he starts sketching. Bran, in appropriate fashion, pretends to be endlessly frustrated by Pod&rsquo;s insistence.</p><p>They also grow closer and closer as time goes by, spending almost every moment of the day together. More often than not Bran will ask Podrick to stay with him when he goes to bed, and who is Pod to say no to his King? Endless nights are spend cuddled together, arms around each other, heads burrowed in shoulders, and gentle kisses exchanged until sleep takes them both.</p><p>No one suspects a thing, or so they&rsquo;d choose to believe, until it comes time for Bran to have a portrait painted of him. Tyrion finds supposedly the best artist in the capital, but when the painting&rsquo;s unveiled to the small council, there&rsquo;s something off with it.</p><p>They stand around staring at it, Tyrion humming thoughtfully.</p><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think it&hellip; captures you, Your Grace.&rdquo; He says, after a time.</p><p>Davos scoffs, &ldquo;It looks nothin&rsquo; like him!&rdquo;</p><p>Bran knows they&rsquo;re right. The artistry is beautiful, there&rsquo;s no denying it, but it&rsquo;s not quite the amazing depiction of him they&rsquo;d all hoped for.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, nothin&rsquo; to be done about it now,&rdquo; Bronn interjects, &ldquo;She was the best artist in the six bloody kingdoms, no ones gonna do a better job.&rdquo;</p><p>The council hum their agreement, but still eye the painting with slight distaste. Bran turns to Podrick, who smiles gently at him as if to cheer him up. That gives Bran an idea.</p><p>&ldquo;I know someone who could,&rdquo; he announces, &ldquo;Paint a better portrait, that is.&rdquo;, he clarifies when he&rsquo;s met with confused glances. &ldquo;Our very own Ser Podrick. He&rsquo;s captured my face brilliantly countless times, I don&rsquo;t see why he shouldn&rsquo;t again.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion sends Pod off to collect a sample of his drawings, and when he returns, he takes a seat next to Bran, who takes his hand discreetly, squeezing it reassuringly while they&rsquo;re all stood around admiring Pod&rsquo;s work, Brienne and Davos occasionally casting knowing looks their way.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Tyrion says after a while, &ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;ve found someone to paint our King&rsquo;s new portrait.&rdquo; He shoots Pod a proud smile, before bowing to Bran and leaving the room.</p><p>Everyone begins to file out, Bronn unsuccessfully attempting to sneak out a handful of Pod&rsquo;s drawings to sell in the city. Brienne gives Pod a squeeze on the shoulder as she leaves, wearing a small grin on her face.</p><p>When they&rsquo;re finally left alone, Pod pulls Bran close to him, hugging him tight.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, I hope I don&rsquo;t disappoint you.&rdquo; He says softly in Bran&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>Bran pulls back, holding Podrick by the shoulder to look him in the eye.</p><p>&ldquo;You could never disappoint me Podrick.&rdquo; He says earnestly. He pulls Pod in for a quick kiss, which turns into another, and another, until their lips have been locked together for a fair few minutes. Studying Bran&rsquo;s features, the ones he knows so well now and has recreated on paper countless times - the curve of his nose, the shape of his eyes, the v of his Cupid&rsquo;s bow- he can&rsquo;t hold himself back.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you Bran,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I really do.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran&rsquo;s eyes soften, and he pecks Podrick on the forehead sweetly.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Podrick. More than you can know.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>If Brienne, Davos, and Tyrion are all watching through the door they never mention it. Nor do they mention the tears they all have to mop up before they head off to complete their duties.</p>",
