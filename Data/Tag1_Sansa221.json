They are adaptable, they are capable of changing themselves in amazing ways to accommodate themselves in different situations. They do have different skill sets in some aspects that are best utilised in the canon plots, but there is nothing to say they wont have been able to survive (make it through in the end alive) if their situations had been exchanged. Yes, initially they would have struggled. Arya is more familiar with\u00a0 commoners and had an easier time in adjusting to the environmental ( &amp; social?) change than Sansa would have. And Arya is not as good with her words as Sansa is. But the whole idea is that the struggles and journeys both characters go through are learning experiences (horrifically traumatic ones) as well, and both sisters are quick learners and despite struggles, i definitely believe both would have made it through in the end.\u00a0</p>",
