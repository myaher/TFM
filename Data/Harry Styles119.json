My boss had kept me longer than he was supposed to and i was tired and frustrated. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier for the weekend but I had to admit what I really wanted was to immerse myself in a very warm bubble bath with a glass of wine and soft music. Unfortunately, I made a promise, and I hated to disappoint. </p><p>I walked to the bar and sat on a stool, ordering a drink, and that&rsquo;s when I saw him sit right next to me. His curly brown hair fell on his forehead and a dimple dug itself in his left cheek as his lips curled into an intoxicated smile. He was pretty and my heart skipped a beat at his sight. I smiled despite myself but looked back in front of me as the bartender handed me my glass.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey gorgeous.&rdquo;</p><p>My heart jumped in my chest and I chuckled, tilting my head and turning to him. He sent me a smirk, or what looked like it, but I could clearly see he was drunk. I only nodded slightly and for some reason, it made him move closer.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean it, y'know.&rdquo; he whispered, moving his face closer to mine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the <i>beautifulest</i> person in this place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Beautifulest</i>?&rdquo; I chuckled again, amused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that\u2019s not a word.&rdquo;</p><p>He groaned low and closed his eyes tight for a second before opening them again and diving his gaze in mine.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm mayb&rsquo; not.&rdquo; he slurred.</p><!-- more --><p>This time, I laughed, and I could swear it made his eyes sparkle. He sat up straight again and twisted his stool my way, pressing his knee gently against my thigh. I glanced down at his jeans rubbing against my bare leg and held my breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought some international superstar who writes songs for a living would have a better vocabulary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; he let out a bit louder, shaking his finger, a smile still plastered on his face. &ldquo;You recognized me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>I laughed again but didn&rsquo;t answer. His hand found mine on the counter and I licked my lips when his warm skin met mine. Fuck, he made butterflies hit the inside of my stomach and the closer he got, the harder my heart beat against my rib cage.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to use m\u2019 fame to bring you back home but if yeh tell me it would work then I just will.&rdquo;</p><p>It felt like my fingers covered by his were burning but I acted like It didn&rsquo;t do anything to me and used my other hand to bring my glass to my lips, still staring at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not really starstruck right now, to be quite honest with you.&rdquo;</p><p>His smile fell and it made me burst into laughter, bringing a few other customers&rsquo; attention. He, however, kept his eyes on me the whole time. I knew he was drunk, but I enjoyed the way he was looking at me, like no one else in the world mattered or would ever matter.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a s-shame, kitten.&rdquo;</p><p>The way he stuttered due to the amount of alcohol running in his veins was endearing and I moved closer, bending down slightly, His eyes immediately fell down and he smirked again as he stared barefacedly at my cleavage. I let him but cleared my throat. It took him a few seconds before looking up in my eyes and I raised my eyebrows, even more amused than before.</p><p>&ldquo;My eyes are up here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm, I know, M'sorry.&rdquo; he smiled more. &ldquo;Yeh just have such a nice r-&rdquo;</p><p>I quickly pressed my palm on his lips and he looked surprised but still stopped talking.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ruin this, will you?&rdquo;</p><p>He kept silent, his glossy eyes roaming on my face, and finally nodded slowly. I pulled my hand away and his eyes dropped to my lips. I wanted to kiss him too, there was nothing I wanted more at this exact moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to kiss you, baby girl.&rdquo; he let out in a low tone, as if he could read my mind. &ldquo;But y'know, I really can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m engaged.&rdquo;</p><p>He quickly brought his hand up and shook his head, realizing his mistake. He finally brought the other one up to show me his gold ring. I stared at it a few seconds and looked up in his eyes, raising my eyebrows.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you now&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded exaggeratedly and I rolled my eyes, bringing my hand up too and showing him my own ring.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>He grabbed my hand and contemplated the ring on my finger for a few seconds before bringing my hand up, pressing his lips on the back of it.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that to our future spouses, it&rsquo;d be wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Totally.&rdquo;</p><p>We stared at each other and I felt my heart twist in my chest but it&rsquo;s really when his fingertips brushed against my skin that it fully melted.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh kitten, the things I would do to you if \u00a0we both weren&rsquo;t taken,&rdquo;</p><p>I was surprised the whole sentence made sense and he didn&rsquo;t even trip on his words but I didn&rsquo;t have time to think more about it, I was completely paralyzed by the way he looked at me and by how close his mouth was from mine.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should do it anyway.&rdquo; I breathed, running my tongue on my bottom lip, feeling suddenly desperate for a kiss.</p><p>He moved closer and I could feel his warm breath against my skin.</p><p>&ldquo;What would my girlfriend say if she found out?&rdquo;</p><p>This time, my lips curled into a fond smile and I brought my hand up to his chest, gripping his shirt in a fist. He smelled good, and I knew he tasted even better.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s fine, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p>It seemed to take forever until I felt his mouth brush on mine and the feeling of relief that invaded me when his lips parted mine to kiss me deeper was indescribable. At this moment, I didn&rsquo;t regret coming in this bar, I didn&rsquo;t even feel like I had a bad day. With one simple yet intense kiss, this day had turned into an amazing one. I felt his fingers brush against my chest and I smiled against his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you can&rsquo;t do that in public.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo; sorry, princess.&rdquo; he apologized in a mix of a whisper and a whimper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been waiting for you here for hours and the boys and I sort of had a few drinks.&rdquo;</p><p>I chuckled against his mouth and pulled away slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yea? I couldn&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; I joked, making him raise his nose in a grimace.</p><p>&ldquo;When you walked in I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes.&rdquo; he added, ignoring my comment. &ldquo;You are the <i>beautifulest</i> person in the universe. I want to bring you home.&rdquo;</p><p>I laughed and brought my hands up to cup his cheeks and peck his lips gently.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s gonna bring you home, you clearly can&rsquo;t drive.&rdquo; I shook my head with a smile. &ldquo;Harry, you realize i&rsquo;m your girlfriend, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; He frowned again and moved back, shaking his head as I placed my hands on his thighs. &ldquo;The<i> beautifulest</i> girl around is my girl.&rdquo;</p><p>His gaze dropped down again and he smirked, making me chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s go back home now.&rdquo; I just said, swallowing quickly what was left of my wine and getting up. &ldquo;Do you need help to walk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can walk by myself.&rdquo; he replied, getting up too but slightly unsteady on his feet. &ldquo;And we can go home but we surely won&rsquo;t sleep. M&rsquo; about to take care of yeh, kitten.&rdquo;</p>",

I smiled despite myself but looked back in front of me as the bartender handed me my glass.</p><p>\u201cHey gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped in my chest and I chuckled, tilting my head and turning to him. He sent me a smirk, or what looked like it, but I could clearly see he was drunk. I only nodded slightly and for some reason, it made him move closer.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, y'know.\u201d he whispered, moving his face closer to mine. \u201cYou\u2019re the <i>beautifulest</i> person in this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Beautifulest</i>?\u201d I chuckled again, amused. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not a word.\u201d</p><p>He groaned low and closed his eyes tight for a second before opening them again and diving his gaze in mine.</p><p>\u201cMm mayb\u2019 not.\u201d he slurred.</p>[[MORE]]<p>This time, I laughed, and I could swear it made his eyes sparkle. He sat up straight again and twisted his stool my way, pressing his knee gently against my thigh. I glanced down at his jeans rubbing against my bare leg and held my breath.</p><p>\u201cI thought some international superstar who writes songs for a living would have a better vocabulary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ha!\u201d he let out a bit louder, shaking his finger, a smile still plastered on his face. \u201cYou recognized me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I laughed again but didn\u2019t answer. His hand found mine on the counter and I licked my lips when his warm skin met mine. Fuck, he made butterflies hit the inside of my stomach and the closer he got, the harder my heart beat against my rib cage.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to use m\u2019 fame to bring you back home but if yeh tell me it would work then I just will.\u201d</p><p>It felt like my fingers covered by his were burning but I acted like It didn\u2019t do anything to me and used my other hand to bring my glass to my lips, still staring at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not really starstruck right now, to be quite honest with you.\u201d</p><p>His smile fell and it made me burst into laughter, bringing a few other customers\u2019 attention. He, however, kept his eyes on me the whole time. I knew he was drunk, but I enjoyed the way he was looking at me, like no one else in the world mattered or would ever matter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a s-shame, kitten.\u201d</p><p>The way he stuttered due to the amount of alcohol running in his veins was endearing and I moved closer, bending down slightly, His eyes immediately fell down and he smirked again as he stared barefacedly at my cleavage. I let him but cleared my throat. It took him a few seconds before looking up in my eyes and I raised my eyebrows, even more amused than before.</p><p>\u201cMy eyes are up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm, I know, M'sorry.\u201d he smiled more. \u201cYeh just have such a nice r-\u201d</p><p>I quickly pressed my palm on his lips and he looked surprised but still stopped talking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ruin this, will you?\u201d</p><p>He kept silent, his glossy eyes roaming on my face, and finally nodded slowly. I pulled my hand away and his eyes dropped to my lips. I wanted to kiss him too, there was nothing I wanted more at this exact moment.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you, baby girl.\u201d he let out in a low tone, as if he could read my mind. \u201cBut y'know, I really can\u2019t. I\u2019m engaged.\u201d</p><p>He quickly brought his hand up and shook his head, realizing his mistake. He finally brought the other one up to show me his gold ring. I stared at it a few seconds and looked up in his eyes, raising my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cAre you now\u2026\u201d</p><p>He nodded exaggeratedly and I rolled my eyes, bringing my hand up too and showing him my own ring.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand and contemplated the ring on my finger for a few seconds before bringing my hand up, pressing his lips on the back of it.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do that to our future spouses, it\u2019d be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other and I felt my heart twist in my chest but it\u2019s really when his fingertips brushed against my skin that it fully melted.</p><p>\u201cOh kitten, the things I would do to you if \u00a0we both weren\u2019t taken,\u201d</p><p>I was surprised the whole sentence made sense and he didn\u2019t even trip on his words but I didn\u2019t have time to think more about it, I was completely paralyzed by the way he looked at me and by how close his mouth was from mine.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should do it anyway.\u201d I breathed, running my tongue on my bottom lip, feeling suddenly desperate for a kiss.</p><p>He moved closer and I could feel his warm breath against my skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat would my girlfriend say if she found out?\u201d</p><p>This time, my lips curled into a fond smile and I brought my hand up to his chest, gripping his shirt in a fist. He smelled good, and I knew he tasted even better.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d say it\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to take forever until I felt his mouth brush on mine and the feeling of relief that invaded me when his lips parted mine to kiss me deeper was indescribable. At this moment, I didn\u2019t regret coming in this bar, I didn\u2019t even feel like I had a bad day. With one simple yet intense kiss, this day had turned into an amazing one. I felt his fingers brush against my chest and I smiled against his lips.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you can\u2019t do that in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019 sorry, princess.\u201d he apologized in a mix of a whisper and a whimper. \u201cI\u2019ve just been waiting for you here for hours and the boys and I sort of had a few drinks.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled against his mouth and pulled away slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh yea? I couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d I joked, making him raise his nose in a grimace.</p><p>\u201cWhen you walked in I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\u201d he added, ignoring my comment. \u201cYou are the <i>beautifulest</i> person in the universe. I want to bring you home.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and brought my hands up to cup his cheeks and peck his lips gently.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the one who\u2019s gonna bring you home, you clearly can\u2019t drive.\u201d I shook my head with a smile. \u201cHarry, you realize i\u2019m your girlfriend, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d He frowned again and moved back, shaking his head as I placed my hands on his thighs. \u201cThe<i> beautifulest</i> girl around is my girl.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped down again and he smirked, making me chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go back home now.\u201d I just said, swallowing quickly what was left of my wine and getting up. \u201cDo you need help to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk by myself.\u201d he replied, getting up too but slightly unsteady on his feet. \u201cAnd we can go home but we surely won\u2019t sleep. M\u2019 about to take care of yeh, kitten.\u201d</p>",

He smelled good, and I knew he tasted even better.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s fine, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p>It seemed to take forever until I felt his mouth brush on mine and the feeling of relief that invaded me when his lips parted mine to kiss me deeper was indescribable. At this moment, I didn&rsquo;t regret coming in this bar, I didn&rsquo;t even feel like I had a bad day. With one simple yet intense kiss, this day had turned into an amazing one. I felt his fingers brush against my chest and I smiled against his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you can&rsquo;t do that in public.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo; sorry, princess.&rdquo; he apologized in a mix of a whisper and a whimper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been waiting for you here for hours and the boys and I sort of had a few drinks.&rdquo;</p><p>I chuckled against his mouth and pulled away slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yea? I couldn&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; I joked, making him raise his nose in a grimace.</p><p>&ldquo;When you walked in I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes.&rdquo; he added, ignoring my comment. &ldquo;You are the <i>beautifulest</i> person in the universe. I want to bring you home.&rdquo;</p><p>I laughed and brought my hands up to cup his cheeks and peck his lips gently.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s gonna bring you home, you clearly can&rsquo;t drive.&rdquo; I shook my head with a smile. &ldquo;Harry, you realize i&rsquo;m your girlfriend, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; He frowned again and moved back, shaking his head as I placed my hands on his thighs. &ldquo;The<i> beautifulest</i> girl around is my girl.&rdquo;</p><p>His gaze dropped down again and he smirked, making me chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s go back home now.&rdquo; I just said, swallowing quickly what was left of my wine and getting up. &ldquo;Do you need help to walk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can walk by myself.&rdquo; he replied, getting up too but slightly unsteady on his feet. &ldquo;And we can go home but we surely won&rsquo;t sleep. M&rsquo; about to take care of yeh, kitten.&rdquo;</p>",

My boss had kept me longer than he was supposed to and i was tired and frustrated. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier for the weekend but I had to admit what I really wanted was to immerse myself in a very warm bubble bath with a glass of wine and soft music. Unfortunately, I made a promise, and I hated to disappoint. </p>\n<p>I walked to the bar and sat on a stool, ordering a drink, and that&rsquo;s when I saw him sit right next to me. His curly brown hair fell on his forehead and a dimple dug itself in his left cheek as his lips curled into an intoxicated smile. He was pretty and my heart skipped a beat at his sight. I smiled despite myself but looked back in front of me as the bartender handed me my glass.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey gorgeous.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>My heart jumped in my chest and I chuckled, tilting my head and turning to him. He sent me a smirk, or what looked like it, but I could clearly see he was drunk. I only nodded slightly and for some reason, it made him move closer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I mean it, y'know.&rdquo; he whispered, moving his face closer to mine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the <i>beautifulest</i> person in this place.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Beautifulest</i>?&rdquo; I chuckled again, amused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s not a word.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He groaned low and closed his eyes tight for a second before opening them again and diving his gaze in mine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mm mayb&rsquo; not.&rdquo; he slurred.</p>\n</p>",

Your hands are in his hair, massaging his\nscalp and pulling him impossibly closer while his arms are wrapped around your\nlower back, holding you flush against him. He\u2019s nearly panting against your\nmouth, his hips involuntarily rutting up against you and trying to create friction\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>His lips leave yours and continue down your neck instead,\ngiving you a second to breathe just as his hands start to creep under the hem\nof your skirt. </p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, you can\u2019t.\u201d You breathe, putting your hands over\nhis to stop him. </p><p>He stops dead in his tracks, his whole body suddenly rigid\nas he looks up to meet your eyes. He takes his hands away from your thighs and\nplaces them on your cheeks instead, cupping your face. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it baby? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asks seriously, searching\nyour eyes for any indication of what\u2019s bothering you. </p><p>You try to force yourself to just spit it out but the way\nhis eyes are drilling into you is making the words get stuck in your throat. It\u2019s\nbeen almost a week with him, almost a week since the first time you two made\nout at that stupid party and you still haven\u2019t been able to tell him how\ninexperienced you are. Unlike you, he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He knows\njust how to hold you, just how to massage your lips with his, just how to kiss\ndown your neck and hit all the best spots. You don\u2019t know anything. You don\u2019t\nknow how hard to tug on his hair, how to grind on him just right to make him\nmoan and you <i>certainly</i> don\u2019t know how\nto work your tongue into a kiss the way that he can. </p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d He asks again, dragging you from your thoughts. </p><p>\u201cI just um,\u201d You stutter, trying to throw the words together\nin a way that\u2019ll make them sound the least pitiful, \u201cI haven\u2019t uh, haven\u2019t, you\nknow\u2026\u201d </p><p>His eyes suddenly grow wide and you know instantly that you\u2019re\nboth on the same page now. Your cheeks flush and you sit back on his lap, your\neyes darting to the floor but he\u2019s not having any of that. He wraps his arms\ntighter around you, pulling you back into his chest and ducking his head to\nmeet your eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve never been fucked before, babygirl?\u201d\nHe asks seriously, his mouth hanging open just the slightest bit in shock. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a big deal just, ugh,\u201d You huff, pushing\nyourself off him to stand to your feet, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, and close your\nmouth, you\u2019ll catch flies.\u201d </p><p>He chuckles lightly, trying to grab your hand to pull you\nback onto his lap but you swat his grabby fingers away, \u201cOh, come on love, I\ndidn\u2019t know! What did you expect me to say?\u201d He reasons, dragging himself off\nthe couch to follow you to the front door where you\u2019re hurriedly shoving your\nshoes on, \u201cCome on baby, don\u2019t put your shoes on-\u201c</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d You quip, reaching for your bag but when you\nturn around, he\u2019s standing there with it already gripped in his hands, high\nabove his head and out of your reach. </p><p>\u201cHarry, come on-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNope, you\u2019re not going anywhere until we talk about this.\u201d\nHe says seriously. </p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d You sigh, crossing your arms. </p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d He says matter-of-factly, \u201cI need to know what\nyou\u2019re comfortable with, what you\u2019ve done and what you like-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything, Harry.\u201d You shrug, your eyes\ndarting once again to the floor and staring at your jittery feet. </p><p>Suddenly he\u2019s inches from you, your bag no longer held above\nhis head and his free hand reaching to grab you by the chin and tilt your face\nup to meet his. </p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done <i>anything</i>?\u201d\nHe asks, the words rolling off his tongue slowly. </p><p>\u201cThat <i>is</i> what I\nsaid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You tease nervously, your stomach doing somersaults the longer\nhe\u2019s looking at you like that. </p><p>\u201cGet over here.\u201d He nods, grabbing your hand roughly and\ntugging you behind him as he walks back over to the couch. </p><p>He drops your bag and collapses back on the couch, grabbing\nyou by the backs of your thighs and pulling you back onto his lap. His hands\nare instantly resting on your thighs, rubbing up and down your now goose-bump\ncovered skin. </p><p>\u201cHarry what are you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo no one\u2019s ever made you feel good before?\u201d He asks\ndarkly, his eyes locked on yours. </p><p>Suddenly your mouth is incredibly dry, and you don\u2019t trust\nyour voice to be able to answer without him knowing just how worked up you are\nalready. You nod your head, involuntarily squeezing your thighs together and\nhoping he can\u2019t feel it. </p><p>His eyes dart down to your lap almost instantly before he\nlooks back up with that wicked smile on his face, \u201cAre you wet down there,\ndarling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You lie, biting your lip to keep your thighs from\ntensing. </p><p>That devious smirk is back on his face in seconds. His right\nhand moves from your thigh to cup your cheek and you feel yourself leaning into\nhis touch. His fingers trail down your face and he grabs your chin once again,\nhis thumb running lightly over your bottom lip and making you whimper. </p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d He smirks, leaning forward to grab your bottom lip\nbetween his teeth, \u201cShould we do something about that?\u201d </p><p>You\u2019re nearly shaking just sitting on his lap as his hands\ncreep back under the hem of your skirt. His lips are making their way back down\nyour neck; licking, sucking, <i>biting</i>. You\nknow you\u2019ll be covering up a handful of little purple bruises before work\ntomorrow but that\u2019s the last thing you\u2019re worried about as his hands continue\nsliding closer and closer to the waistband of your panties. </p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d You gasp, putting your hand over his but not\nnecessarily stopping him. </p><p>\u201cSay the word and I\u2019ll stop, I promise,\u201d He whispers, his\nlips ghosting over your ear and nipping at your earlobe, \u201cDo you trust me, baby?\u201d\n</p><p>You nod your head vigorously, sucking in a sharp breath when\nhis thumb just barely skims over the wet spot pooling in your underwear.

Your hands are in his hair, massaging his\nscalp and pulling him impossibly closer while his arms are wrapped around your\nlower back, holding you flush against him. He\u2019s nearly panting against your\nmouth, his hips involuntarily rutting up against you and trying to create friction\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>His lips leave yours and continue down your neck instead,\ngiving you a second to breathe just as his hands start to creep under the hem\nof your skirt. </p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, you can\u2019t.\u201d You breathe, putting your hands over\nhis to stop him. </p><p>He stops dead in his tracks, his whole body suddenly rigid\nas he looks up to meet your eyes. He takes his hands away from your thighs and\nplaces them on your cheeks instead, cupping your face. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it baby? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asks seriously, searching\nyour eyes for any indication of what\u2019s bothering you. </p><p>You try to force yourself to just spit it out but the way\nhis eyes are drilling into you is making the words get stuck in your throat. It\u2019s\nbeen almost a week with him, almost a week since the first time you two made\nout at that stupid party and you still haven\u2019t been able to tell him how\ninexperienced you are. Unlike you, he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He knows\njust how to hold you, just how to massage your lips with his, just how to kiss\ndown your neck and hit all the best spots. You don\u2019t know anything. You don\u2019t\nknow how hard to tug on his hair, how to grind on him just right to make him\nmoan and you <i>certainly</i> don\u2019t know how\nto work your tongue into a kiss the way that he can. </p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d He asks again, dragging you from your thoughts. </p><p>\u201cI just um,\u201d You stutter, trying to throw the words together\nin a way that\u2019ll make them sound the least pitiful, \u201cI haven\u2019t uh, haven\u2019t, you\nknow\u2026\u201d </p><p>His eyes suddenly grow wide and you know instantly that you\u2019re\nboth on the same page now. Your cheeks flush and you sit back on his lap, your\neyes darting to the floor but he\u2019s not having any of that. He wraps his arms\ntighter around you, pulling you back into his chest and ducking his head to\nmeet your eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve never been fucked before, babygirl?\u201d\nHe asks seriously, his mouth hanging open just the slightest bit in shock. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a big deal just, ugh,\u201d You huff, pushing\nyourself off him to stand to your feet, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, and close your\nmouth, you\u2019ll catch flies.\u201d </p><p>He chuckles lightly, trying to grab your hand to pull you\nback onto his lap but you swat his grabby fingers away, \u201cOh, come on love, I\ndidn\u2019t know! What did you expect me to say?\u201d He reasons, dragging himself off\nthe couch to follow you to the front door where you\u2019re hurriedly shoving your\nshoes on, \u201cCome on baby, don\u2019t put your shoes on-\u201c</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d You quip, reaching for your bag but when you\nturn around, he\u2019s standing there with it already gripped in his hands, high\nabove his head and out of your reach. </p><p>\u201cHarry, come on-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNope, you\u2019re not going anywhere until we talk about this.\u201d\nHe says seriously. </p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d You sigh, crossing your arms. </p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d He says matter-of-factly, \u201cI need to know what\nyou\u2019re comfortable with, what you\u2019ve done and what you like-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything, Harry.\u201d You shrug, your eyes\ndarting once again to the floor and staring at your jittery feet. </p><p>Suddenly he\u2019s inches from you, your bag no longer held above\nhis head and his free hand reaching to grab you by the chin and tilt your face\nup to meet his. </p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done <i>anything</i>?\u201d\nHe asks, the words rolling off his tongue slowly. </p><p>\u201cThat <i>is</i> what I\nsaid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You tease nervously, your stomach doing somersaults the longer\nhe\u2019s looking at you like that. </p><p>\u201cGet over here.\u201d He nods, grabbing your hand roughly and\ntugging you behind him as he walks back over to the couch. </p><p>He drops your bag and collapses back on the couch, grabbing\nyou by the backs of your thighs and pulling you back onto his lap. His hands\nare instantly resting on your thighs, rubbing up and down your now goose-bump\ncovered skin. </p><p>\u201cHarry what are you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo no one\u2019s ever made you feel good before?\u201d He asks\ndarkly, his eyes locked on yours. </p><p>Suddenly your mouth is incredibly dry, and you don\u2019t trust\nyour voice to be able to answer without him knowing just how worked up you are\nalready. You nod your head, involuntarily squeezing your thighs together and\nhoping he can\u2019t feel it. </p><p>His eyes dart down to your lap almost instantly before he\nlooks back up with that wicked smile on his face, \u201cAre you wet down there,\ndarling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You lie, biting your lip to keep your thighs from\ntensing. </p><p>That devious smirk is back on his face in seconds. His right\nhand moves from your thigh to cup your cheek and you feel yourself leaning into\nhis touch. His fingers trail down your face and he grabs your chin once again,\nhis thumb running lightly over your bottom lip and making you whimper. </p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d He smirks, leaning forward to grab your bottom lip\nbetween his teeth, \u201cShould we do something about that?\u201d </p><p>You\u2019re nearly shaking just sitting on his lap as his hands\ncreep back under the hem of your skirt.

What did you expect me to say?\u201d He reasons, dragging himself off\nthe couch to follow you to the front door where you\u2019re hurriedly shoving your\nshoes on, \u201cCome on baby, don\u2019t put your shoes on-\u201c</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d You quip, reaching for your bag but when you\nturn around, he\u2019s standing there with it already gripped in his hands, high\nabove his head and out of your reach. </p><p>\u201cHarry, come on-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNope, you\u2019re not going anywhere until we talk about this.\u201d\nHe says seriously. </p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d You sigh, crossing your arms. </p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d He says matter-of-factly, \u201cI need to know what\nyou\u2019re comfortable with, what you\u2019ve done and what you like-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything, Harry.\u201d You shrug, your eyes\ndarting once again to the floor and staring at your jittery feet. </p><p>Suddenly he\u2019s inches from you, your bag no longer held above\nhis head and his free hand reaching to grab you by the chin and tilt your face\nup to meet his. </p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done <i>anything</i>?\u201d\nHe asks, the words rolling off his tongue slowly. </p><p>\u201cThat <i>is</i> what I\nsaid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You tease nervously, your stomach doing somersaults the longer\nhe\u2019s looking at you like that. </p><p>\u201cGet over here.\u201d He nods, grabbing your hand roughly and\ntugging you behind him as he walks back over to the couch. </p><p>He drops your bag and collapses back on the couch, grabbing\nyou by the backs of your thighs and pulling you back onto his lap. His hands\nare instantly resting on your thighs, rubbing up and down your now goose-bump\ncovered skin. </p><p>\u201cHarry what are you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo no one\u2019s ever made you feel good before?\u201d He asks\ndarkly, his eyes locked on yours. </p><p>Suddenly your mouth is incredibly dry, and you don\u2019t trust\nyour voice to be able to answer without him knowing just how worked up you are\nalready. You nod your head, involuntarily squeezing your thighs together and\nhoping he can\u2019t feel it. </p><p>His eyes dart down to your lap almost instantly before he\nlooks back up with that wicked smile on his face, \u201cAre you wet down there,\ndarling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You lie, biting your lip to keep your thighs from\ntensing. </p><p>That devious smirk is back on his face in seconds. His right\nhand moves from your thigh to cup your cheek and you feel yourself leaning into\nhis touch. His fingers trail down your face and he grabs your chin once again,\nhis thumb running lightly over your bottom lip and making you whimper. </p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d He smirks, leaning forward to grab your bottom lip\nbetween his teeth, \u201cShould we do something about that?\u201d </p><p>You\u2019re nearly shaking just sitting on his lap as his hands\ncreep back under the hem of your skirt. His lips are making their way back down\nyour neck; licking, sucking, <i>biting</i>. You\nknow you\u2019ll be covering up a handful of little purple bruises before work\ntomorrow but that\u2019s the last thing you\u2019re worried about as his hands continue\nsliding closer and closer to the waistband of your panties. </p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d You gasp, putting your hand over his but not\nnecessarily stopping him. </p><p>\u201cSay the word and I\u2019ll stop, I promise,\u201d He whispers, his\nlips ghosting over your ear and nipping at your earlobe, \u201cDo you trust me, baby?\u201d\n</p><p>You nod your head vigorously, sucking in a sharp breath when\nhis thumb just barely skims over the wet spot pooling in your underwear. He swallows\nroughly, his thumb pressing against you and making you lurch forward, burying\nyour face in his shoulder. </p><p>\u201c<i>Shit</i>, sorry, you\nokay?\u201d He asks worriedly, leaning back against the couch to brush your hair out\nof your face, \u201cYou\u2019re already soaking through your panties, love.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, H.\u201d You groan, hiding your flaming cheeks as\nyou bury your face in his chest and try to catch your breath. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing baby,\u201d He assures you, rubbing his\nhands up and down your back, \u201cJust means I\u2019m doing my job is all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour job, huh?\u201d You smirk, finally sitting back up and\ndraping your arms over his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d He grins, leaning forward to peck your lips, \u201cI\njust want to make you feel good, babygirl.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t even bother concealing the blush flooding your cheeks\nwhen he\u2019s smiling at you like that. You know he\u2019s waiting for you to tell him\nto continue but you don\u2019t know if you could find the words if you tried. </p><p>\u201cHow about we start real easy,\u201d He nods, his hands moving to\ngrip your hips and slide you over until you\u2019re straddling his thigh, \u201cThere we\ngo,\u201d He says, starting to swivel your hips in figure eights, \u201cJust like that\nbaby, don\u2019t lift yourself up, grind down on me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn your leg?\u201d You ask nervously, allowing him to continue\nmoving your hips. </p><p>\u201cYup, right there,\u201d He nods, shoving your hips down against him\nand you gasp, smacking your hands over his, \u201cYou okay? Too much?\u201d He asks\nworriedly, ceasing his movements. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d You pant, squeezing his fingers and nearly\nbegging him to keep rolling your hips against him, \u201cGod, please Harry, don\u2019t stop.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d He chuckles, clearly enjoying himself as he\nwatches you throw your head back, biting your lip, \u201cFeels good, love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d You hum, pressing your lips together as you try to conceal\nthe whimpering moans caught in your throat. </p><p>\u201cYou better not be holding back now, Y/N,\u201d He warns,\nreleasing his tight grip on your waist and letting you move your hips yourself,\n\u201cTell me how good it feels.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo good, Harry.\u201d You whimper, oblivious to the fact that\nyou\u2019re grinding against him all on your own now. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great baby,\u201d He smiles, tucking your hair\nbehind your ear to get it out of your face, \u201cYou\u2019re a natural.\u201d </p><p>You chuckle, letting your eyes flicker open to see his\ngrinning face as he watches you in your moment of pure bliss. It\u2019s then that\nyou realize his hands are folded behind his head as he watches you, leaning casually\nagainst the back of the couch. He\u2019s not helping you anymore, you\u2019re doing all of\nit on your own and it feels <i>fantastic</i>.\n</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d You pant, grabbing at him, \u201cYou\u2019re so far away.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, babygirl,\u201d He assures you, sitting back up\nand placing his hands on your spread thighs, \u201cIs this okay? Do you want me to\nguide you again?\u201d </p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d You breathe, your movements quickening as the\nburn in the pit of your stomach starts to spread throughout your body. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice.\u201d He grins, cupping your face\nin his hands and capturing your mouth with his. </p><p>His mouth moves against yours in perfect synchronization with\nthe movements of your hips. Your chest is heaving against his and you can\nhardly control your lips enough to kiss him back as you rut yourself against\nhim. </p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d He hisses, pulling away from your lips to\nsqueeze his eyes shut and suck in a breath, \u201cGod I can feel you soaking through\nyour panties baby, my leg is drenched.\u201d </p><p>His filthy words are all you need to push you over the edge.\nSuddenly you\u2019re gasping for air and collapsing against him, your face nuzzling\ninto his shoulder. His arms wrap around you, holding you to him while you struggle\nto pull oxygen into your lungs and catch your breath. Your mind is fuzzy, and\nyour vision is returning from the blast of bright white that suddenly took over\nall of your senses as his hands run up and down your back. </p><p>\u201cHow was it, babygirl?\u201d He chuckles, running his fingers through\nyour hair. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d You nod, dragging yourself to sit up in his lap, \u201cIt\nwas really good, but what about you? What do you want?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me, darling,\u201d He grins, pulling you\nback into his chest and leaning down to kiss your temple, \u201cI can wait until you\u2019re\nready and you know <i>exactly</i> what you\nwant.\u201d<br></p>",

Your hands are in his hair, massaging his\nscalp and pulling him impossibly closer while his arms are wrapped around your\nlower back, holding you flush against him. He&rsquo;s nearly panting against your\nmouth, his hips involuntarily rutting up against you and trying to create friction\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>His lips leave yours and continue down your neck instead,\ngiving you a second to breathe just as his hands start to creep under the hem\nof your skirt. </p><p>&ldquo;No, Harry, you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; You breathe, putting your hands over\nhis to stop him. </p><p>He stops dead in his tracks, his whole body suddenly rigid\nas he looks up to meet your eyes.

It&rsquo;s\nbeen almost a week with him, almost a week since the first time you two made\nout at that stupid party and you still haven&rsquo;t been able to tell him how\ninexperienced you are. Unlike you, he knows exactly what he&rsquo;s doing. He knows\njust how to hold you, just how to massage your lips with his, just how to kiss\ndown your neck and hit all the best spots. You don&rsquo;t know anything. You don&rsquo;t\nknow how hard to tug on his hair, how to grind on him just right to make him\nmoan and you <i>certainly</i> don&rsquo;t know how\nto work your tongue into a kiss the way that he can. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; He asks again, dragging you from your thoughts. </p><p>&ldquo;I just um,&rdquo; You stutter, trying to throw the words together\nin a way that&rsquo;ll make them sound the least pitiful, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t uh, haven&rsquo;t, you\nknow&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>His eyes suddenly grow wide and you know instantly that you&rsquo;re\nboth on the same page now.

Olivia, Olivia, the name kept ringing in Lane&rsquo;s head like a mantra.</i></p><!-- more --><p>The fall breeze makes Lane regret not bringing a jacket. She knows she should have grabbed one, and now she was shivering walking back to her dorm room. It also doesn\u2019t help that it is dark out and she\u2019s alone, still on edge from the episode of <i>Stranger Things, </i>she watched earlier that day. Lane looks behind herself every few steps to make sure she is extraterrestrial free.\u00a0</p><p>Her heart stops slightly as a figure dashes across the sidewalk. Lane exhales realizing it\u2019s only a college squirrel (very different from regular squirrels, college squirrels are greedy and mean), electing a string of curses as she turns onto her street. Almost like fate, she sees a curly-headed boy standing with tall dirty blonde, who\u2019s wrapped up in the boy&rsquo;s arms. Staring intently Lane realizes that its Harry, her diner boy, holding another girl tight to his chest. Distracted she hits her leg against the bench, gaining the couples attention. Harry locks eyes with her, and Lane swears she imagines it, but his eyes brighten.<br/></p><p>&ldquo; Lane what are you doing here,&rdquo; Harry ask, the blonde still nestled into his chest. Lane tries not to focus on the girl and how pretty she is.</p><p>&ldquo; I live in Worthington Hall,&rdquo; she answers, &ldquo; who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0Harry smiles down towards the girl, and Lane feels a slight tinge of jealousy. For some reason, she got it in her head that Harry&rsquo;s smiles were only reserved for her.</p><p>&ldquo; Hi, I&rsquo;m Olivia, Harry&rsquo;s girlfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Lane grins nodding her head like she didn&rsquo;t just get stabbed in the heart. Olivia, Olivia, the name kept ringing in Lane&rsquo;s head like a mantra. &ldquo; Nice to meet you, I work at the diner Harry goes to,&rdquo; Lane says causing Olivia to look pleasantly surprised.</p><p>&ldquo; OMG, no way.
