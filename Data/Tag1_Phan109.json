        "question": "But when dan said in that liveshow\"i'm definitly not stopping youtube\"(or something very similar to this) he looked really honest and determined and he also tweeted that he is waiting for his\"aesthetic\"to be ready which i belive to be his background so all of that make it seems like he is just really on a hiatus to think about how to come back as his real self on youtube and make video for himself that he likes not for \"fanservice\" or what the fan wants?Much like \"giving the people what i want\"",
        "answer": "<p>He could still come back to YouTube. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s out of the question at all. I have no idea what his thoughts are on it at the moment as it\u2019s been quite a while since he shared anything more than three words at a time on the issue. I don\u2019t think things will just resume as they were a year ago though, which some people seem to be holding out for, and I think that is just a recipe for disaster. If Dan does come back and make a video and people get mad at him for having changed and grown, I don\u2019t think he will stick it out as he has done in the past. YouTube isn\u2019t as lucrative as it once was, it\u2019s less of a community, and he clearly isn\u2019t getting the type of creative fulfillment he once was either. When people love their jobs, they want to do them. If he was satisfied with the relationship he has with his fanbase, he would want to interact, not just publish a tweet from his drafts when Phil needs to promote some merch or a video or to assure people he\u2019s not dead. I don\u2019t think Dan\u2019s purposely lying to anyone by the way, even if in the end he does quit YouTube. I think he\u2019s just trying to figure out how to feel fulfilled and create healthy boundaries and where YouTube fits into his life now. He said in ttlmt and in the mukbang videos that what he wants is changing from day to day. I\u2019m personally starting to get bored waiting for him to figure it out, but whenever he does, even if I step away in the mean time, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll check out anything that he does that is for public consumption. Even if Dan does something in the future which is different from what he has done in the past, that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. People grow and change and that\u2019s a part of life. Sometimes doors have to shut for others to open. </p>",

Go back to uni or do whatever he can to make all this \"Phandom\" forget about him. But he can't, can he? Because people are so emotionally attached to him, that they could actually hurt themselves. And he seems to be painfully aware of that. Not to mention that Phil's career kinda depends on Dan. It's a horrible situation to be in.",
        "answer": "<p>I don\u2019t think Dan regrets his time being a YouTuber, at least I\u2019ve never heard him express that. He has had so many opportunities open up to him as a result, including his ability to take this long period of time off to find himself. If he decides not to want to continue with YouTube, he has that option. Yes, in addition to the changes he would have to make personally as a result, it would effect Phil and his fans, but ultimately he has to live his life for himself, not for others and, as much as I miss his content, I am happy for him that he seems to realize this. Having to make difficult decisions that effect the people around you is unfortunately just a normal part of life and being an adult. Business partners go their separate ways all the time. Bands break up. People quit jobs and move on to new things. Family and friends move away from each other. We don\u2019t really know what he is feeling or what he is going to end up doing career-wise and that is hard for a lot of people to cope with, but I do definitely agree very strongly that it isn\u2019t alright for anyone to put the responsibility for their mental health on Dan. He is an entertainer, not a therapist, and anyone threatening to harm themselves if he doesn\u2019t give into their desires is being manipulative and that\u2019s not cool. </p>",
