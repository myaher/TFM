Fall of last 2017 I had an emergency root canal, which I was able to get a care credit card to cover but I had to pay off the final 500$ of it in bulk in February and that really hurt. Some of this is car trouble, cause fall of 2017 I had to pay 600$ to fix my car. Both of these incidents fucked my savings. Some of this is from expenses that came along with doing research this summer for my masters.&nbsp; I have a maxed credit card, that I have used for other various teeth and car related disasters over the years but I finally maxed it out and now my credit card payment is a huge burden.&nbsp;</p><p><b>You can just donate, but, I don&rsquo;t want to just ask for donations.
