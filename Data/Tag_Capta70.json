        "body": "<p><i>\tHigher, Further, Faster.</i> Emotions are a weakness, or are they? Today at JayWrites101 we&rsquo;re looking into the cinematic adventure that is<i> Captian Marvel</i>. Critics everywhere are pitching in on this one, giving it reviews ranging between Masterpiece and Disaster with very little room for leeway. How accurate are those reviews? Let&rsquo;s find out together.</p><p>The purpose of this review is not to promote, nor offend. We&rsquo;re here to break down The Good, The Bad, and The Strange to find out what makes this movie so unique.</p><p>Spoilers ahead.</p><!-- more --><p><b>Medium</b>: Movie<br/><b>Genre:</b> Superhero, action, drama<br/><b>Premise</b>: A superpowered woman with amnesia must find out the truth of who she is so she can stop an interstellar war from destroying her homeworld.</p><p><br/>My, that&rsquo;s such a simple premise, isn&rsquo;t it? Boy, the context of this premise changes dramatically. Our Protagonist, Vers, starts off as a Kree soldier fighting to protect Halla from the Skrulls, big green aliens with the power to shape-shift into anyone. As more information is revealed, she ends as Carol Danvers (not to be confused with Karra Danvers, DC&rsquo;s Supergirl) a human pilot who absorbed a fraction of power from an infinity stone whose mission is to protect Earth from the Kree as they try to use her to take over the galaxy.</p><p>It&rsquo;s funny how the entire plot reverses itself completely, but the basic premise never changed.</p><hr><p><b>Plot:</b> We start off learning about Vers, as she and her team gears up to rescue a spy whose cover has been blown. The mission turns into a complete fiasco when the spy turns out to be a Skrull in disguise. Vers is captured and &ldquo;interrogated&rdquo; using some kind of mind-reading technology. Thing is, she&rsquo;s remembering stuff she couldn&rsquo;t possibly have remembered. Things like getting chewed out for crashing a go-kart, or falling while doing a military course.<br/>Vers manages to escape her captors and flee to Earth. After contacting her team, she joins forces with Nick Fury, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who&rsquo;s thinking about putting together a task force to protect the Earth from major threats. Not a bad idea, that.</p><p>Together they investigate the fragments of memory that Vers recalled from her capture, all while being chased relentlessly by Skrull agents who also made it to Earth. Vers eventually finds a friend who knows the truth and learns that she is, in fact, Carol Dan-vers, a human. Before this revelation has time to sink in, the Skrull offer a flag of truce. They reveal that they&rsquo;re not a military force, just a few survivors trying to hide from the Kree who hunt them relentlessly. As proof, they offer Carol a recording of the incident that robbed her of her memories where it&rsquo;s shown unarguably that her teammates, the Kree, deliberately captured her to find the Tesseract, a device that holds an Infinity Stone, and accidentally gave Carol her powers when she tried to destroy a device that used that energy.</p><p>In the end, Carol and her new friends are captured by the Kree and Carol realizes the device she believed was giving her power, was actually suppressing her powers. She destroys the device and becomes Captian Marvel, a superbeing whose massively undefined powers include energy blasts from her hands and flight. Powers that allow her to tear through a Kree spaceship like it was tissue paper. If you&rsquo;ve watched Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1. then you know these things are no joke, but Carol destroys one in three seconds flat by flying through it.</p><p>Bad guys leave, Carol takes the surviving Skrull to a new planet on the opposite side of the galaxy and Nick Fury begins his Avengers Initiative.<br/>Fast forward to the Present and Carol returns in the end-credit scene to a very confused Captain America and demands to know what happened to Fury.</p><p>This was one heavy plot. I cut a lot out of it and it still took me thirty minutes to give a summary that wouldn&rsquo;t leave you more confused than you began. You wouldn&rsquo;t think this movie was so plot-dense until you have to try to explain it.</p><hr><p><b>The Good:</b> I just broke down the plot, but what&rsquo;s great about <i>Captain Marvel</i> is that this plot is engaging. I had to go to the bathroom about a third of the way through the movie, but I didn&rsquo;t once consider <i>actually leaving</i> because every second of this movie was filled with something.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve heard it said before that a good plot structure is &ldquo;X happened because of Y and causes Z.&rdquo; There are precious few films that encapsulate that principle into the core of it&rsquo;s being better than <i>Captain Marvel</i>. And the nods to future films and plot points were fun to discover as well.</p><p><br/></p><p>Another thing worth noting is how much of the story is conveyed nonverbally. They spend a lot of effort to say as much as they can, using as little dialogue as possible. This helps the viewer to remember plot details better since they&rsquo;re not just passively listening, but it also means that removing attention away from the screen can cause you to miss things crucial to understanding what&rsquo;s going on.<br/>I&rsquo;m leaving this in The Good because <i>Captain Marvel</i> used this feature well. It&rsquo;s always nice to see a visual medium like film use <i>visual storytelling</i> to great effect instead of having someone constantly dumping exposition all the time.</p><p>As a subset of the above, lack of exposition in a movie that is a plot-heavy as this one is always worth noting as praiseworthy.</p><p><br/></p><p>The use of humor to break up the heavier scenes was a relief, and it often came when I least expected it. Real early in the movie there was this scene where &ldquo;Vers&rdquo; was escaping the Skrull&rsquo;s and one of them does this growl at her and she growls back! It was such an absurd little moment of humanity and character that I lost it. And almost anything with that cat! I swear, how they made that monster scratching out Nick Furry&rsquo;s eye out into something hilarious, I&rsquo;ll never know! But they did, and all those little moments made this movie <i>shine</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p>Real briefly, I&rsquo;d like to address a common complaint I&rsquo;ve heard against this movie, Carol&rsquo;s lack of character. These people are <i>full of fluff</i>. Is that it? Can I just leave it here? Do I really have to explain this? Yes?? *sigh* Okay.</p><p><br/>The idea that Carol lacks character is born from her &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; personality type. Now, I&rsquo;m not calling anyone sexist! But this is a personality type that is very often shown in Men\n\n<b>\u2122</b>\n\n, and it doesn&rsquo;t even raise an eyebrow. But to any dude who <i>actually is sexist</i>, and refuses to look at anything other than how large Brie Larson&rsquo;s chest is outside of her superhero suit, this personality type can easily be swapped out with a piece of cardboard and they wouldn&rsquo;t notice.</p><p>Now, guys have been pulling off this \u201ckind of quiet, but kind, but I&rsquo;ll seriously kick your ass if you mess with me,\u201d attitude in film for <i>ages</i>. And quite a few even have had success with it. (I&rsquo;m thinking Resse from <i>Person of Interest</i>, a show that is definitely getting its own review someday.) But it&rsquo;s exceedingly rare for a woman in film to have this personality type.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon in reality, however. And I, personally, like this touch of realism.</p><p>The few moments where Carol allowed herself to laugh felt warm and genuine. All her interactions with her niece were heartwarming. Again, some very important people, some of whom I even respect, say that the side characters never got a chance to shine, and Carol never got a chance to have a character arc.</p><p>But again, they&rsquo;re <i>full of fluff</i>. If anything, expressing emotion <i>was </i>Carol&rsquo;s character arc. By beating up the man in her life that insists that she never feel emotion, Carol shows that her emotions are her strengths and she does not at all have to prove herself to anyone.</p><p>Why?</p><p><i>Because she kept getting back up.</i></p><p>This is a powerful message to tell anyone. Not just women. We heard a variant of the same message in the Dark Knight trilogy. But in this one, it&rsquo;s even more satisfying because the people who kept knocking her down were <i>cheating to begin with.</i></p><p><i><br/></i>Now, I&rsquo;m not going to say that this message was transferred across the eight sexes evenly. I have no doubt that women felt this message more acutely than men. This specific message was <i>made for women</i>. Duh. But there&rsquo;s only one reason why any man could come out of this film feeling attacked.</p><p><br/>They saw themselves in Yon-Rogg.</p><p><br/>I&rsquo;m just saying, if you related to the one male character that got attacked in this movie, <i>you prolly need to be offended</i>. Just a little. It&rsquo;s not going to kill you to take a hard look at yourself, even if you eventually discover that you have, in fact, been an ass at some point in your life.</p><p>Congratulations. Welcome to the human race. Now, <i>move on</i>.</p><p>Before we take our own advice and <i>move on</i>, I&rsquo;d like to address one more thing <i>Captain Marvel</i> did exceptionally well: The sound design.</p><p>This movie sounded wonderful, from the effects to the actual factual background music. Most notably in the third act. There was a point where a character said &ldquo;The music is a nice touch&rdquo; and I agreed completely. A lot of these films use similar or recycled music to amp up &ldquo;the moment&rdquo; but this movie&hellip; well, they didn&rsquo;t turn it up to eleven, but the got it up to ten.</p><p>They had music with lyrics, and that&rsquo;s more than 70% of movies these days. Thumbs up.</p><hr><p><b>The Bad</b>: Remember how I said I loved how engaging this plot was? It&rsquo;s still a freakishly dense plot! This whole thing was so tightly edited there was very little time to just unpack the things that happened. Often, you had to try and unpack the thing that just happened while actually doing the next thing.</p><p>This helps the movie be engaging. But it hamstrings it when it comes to actually following what\u2019s happening. There is just no way to condense this movie. I&rsquo;ve left out tons of stuff just because I have to stop typing this thing eventually!</p><hr><p><b>The Strange:</b> This part of the review is dedicated to the bizarre. To elements or ideas that seem half done, or just really questionable. Not usually bad enough to be constituted as a plot hole, these things are&hellip; just&hellip; things.</p><p>So, for example, the Kree team. What were their names? How many of them were there in the first place?</p><p>Don&rsquo;t know? Me neither, and I took notes when I watched this film. I remember Minn-Erva, the sniper, and Yon-Rogg the main villain. And if I&rsquo;m honest, I actually forgot their names and had to look it up. I didn&rsquo;t even know their group was called &ldquo;Starforce,&rdquo; until I discovered it looking for the correct way to spell their names.</p><p>This is not the best way to set up your main bad guys. Especially if your audience is supposed to care about them at all <i>for any reason</i>.</p><p>And while we&rsquo;re at it, the antagonist himself, Yon-Rogg, could do with a little bit extra development too. We don&rsquo;t really know much about him except that he thinks emotions are weaknesses in a fight, and that Carol using her full power is cheating.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t really know anything else about him, so there&rsquo;s no real sense of betrayal when Carol turns on him. The &ldquo;evil all along&rdquo; trope works best when it&rsquo;s a character you&rsquo;ve been with the whole story who&rsquo;s secretly had a plan the whole time. It works because you, the audience, feels betrayed too. Here&hellip; it just kinda happened. And, depending on how cynical you are, you probably even saw it coming.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like they were going for a sucker punch but aimed it at your forearm; doesn&rsquo;t really hurt, and does little to actually surprise us.</p><hr><p><b>Strongest Scene:</b> When making the strongest scene, I don&rsquo;t mean I look for the scenes with the most meaning packed into them. If I did, the climax or the Intro of a story would win every time. No, what I look for in a strong scene is pure storytelling. How is it shot, who is in it, how does it connect with the rest of the story, and how much does it say.</p><p>For <i>Captain Marvel</i>, my subjective vote goes to the bar scene between Nick Fury and &ldquo;Vers.&rdquo; Even though they&rsquo;ve technically met already, the two are <i>really seeing each other</i> for the first time. Nick, newly awakened to the idea of aliens, and Vers, finally respecting Nick&rsquo;s skills as a competent agent despite his comparative backwater setting.</p><p>Nick realizes he&rsquo;s in about a mile over his head, and Vers realizes she can&rsquo;t work alone.</p><p>They have a nice discussion about their past and aliens, complete with its own little humorous jabs, and there&rsquo;s a very real sense that these two are full partners afterward that carries all along the rest of the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Weakest Scene:</b> As much as it saddens me to say this, I&rsquo;m going to have to put the introduction to the movie here.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it does a fully competent job of setting up Vers and her amnesia.

Critics everywhere are pitching in on this one, giving it reviews ranging between Masterpiece and Disaster with very little room for leeway. How accurate are those reviews? Let\u2019s find out together.</p><p>The purpose of this review is not to promote, nor offend. We\u2019re here to break down The Good, The Bad, and The Strange to find out what makes this movie so unique.</p><p>Spoilers ahead.</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>Medium</b>: Movie<br><b>Genre:</b> Superhero, action, drama<br><b>Premise</b>: A superpowered woman with amnesia must find out the truth of who she is so she can stop an interstellar war from destroying her homeworld.</p><p><br>My, that\u2019s such a simple premise, isn\u2019t it? Boy, the context of this premise changes dramatically. Our Protagonist, Vers, starts off as a Kree soldier fighting to protect Halla from the Skrulls, big green aliens with the power to shape-shift into anyone. As more information is revealed, she ends as Carol Danvers (not to be confused with Karra Danvers, DC\u2019s Supergirl) a human pilot who absorbed a fraction of power from an infinity stone whose mission is to protect Earth from the Kree as they try to use her to take over the galaxy.</p><p>It\u2019s funny how the entire plot reverses itself completely, but the basic premise never changed.</p><hr><p><b>Plot:</b> We start off learning about Vers, as she and her team gears up to rescue a spy whose cover has been blown. The mission turns into a complete fiasco when the spy turns out to be a Skrull in disguise. Vers is captured and \u201cinterrogated\u201d using some kind of mind-reading technology. Thing is, she\u2019s remembering stuff she couldn\u2019t possibly have remembered. Things like getting chewed out for crashing a go-kart, or falling while doing a military course.<br>Vers manages to escape her captors and flee to Earth. After contacting her team, she joins forces with Nick Fury, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who\u2019s thinking about putting together a task force to protect the Earth from major threats. Not a bad idea, that.</p><p>Together they investigate the fragments of memory that Vers recalled from her capture, all while being chased relentlessly by Skrull agents who also made it to Earth. Vers eventually finds a friend who knows the truth and learns that she is, in fact, Carol Dan-vers, a human. Before this revelation has time to sink in, the Skrull offer a flag of truce. They reveal that they\u2019re not a military force, just a few survivors trying to hide from the Kree who hunt them relentlessly. As proof, they offer Carol a recording of the incident that robbed her of her memories where it\u2019s shown unarguably that her teammates, the Kree, deliberately captured her to find the Tesseract, a device that holds an Infinity Stone, and accidentally gave Carol her powers when she tried to destroy a device that used that energy.</p><p>In the end, Carol and her new friends are captured by the Kree and Carol realizes the device she believed was giving her power, was actually suppressing her powers. She destroys the device and becomes Captian Marvel, a superbeing whose massively undefined powers include energy blasts from her hands and flight. Powers that allow her to tear through a Kree spaceship like it was tissue paper. If you\u2019ve watched Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1. then you know these things are no joke, but Carol destroys one in three seconds flat by flying through it.</p><p>Bad guys leave, Carol takes the surviving Skrull to a new planet on the opposite side of the galaxy and Nick Fury begins his Avengers Initiative.<br>Fast forward to the Present and Carol returns in the end-credit scene to a very confused Captain America and demands to know what happened to Fury.</p><p>This was one heavy plot. I cut a lot out of it and it still took me thirty minutes to give a summary that wouldn\u2019t leave you more confused than you began. You wouldn\u2019t think this movie was so plot-dense until you have to try to explain it.</p><hr><p><b>The Good:</b> I just broke down the plot, but what\u2019s great about <i>Captain Marvel</i> is that this plot is engaging. I had to go to the bathroom about a third of the way through the movie, but I didn\u2019t once consider <i>actually leaving</i> because every second of this movie was filled with something.</p><p>I\u2019ve heard it said before that a good plot structure is \u201cX happened because of Y and causes Z.\u201d There are precious few films that encapsulate that principle into the core of it\u2019s being better than <i>Captain Marvel</i>. And the nods to future films and plot points were fun to discover as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing worth noting is how much of the story is conveyed nonverbally. They spend a lot of effort to say as much as they can, using as little dialogue as possible. This helps the viewer to remember plot details better since they\u2019re not just passively listening, but it also means that removing attention away from the screen can cause you to miss things crucial to understanding what\u2019s going on.<br>I\u2019m leaving this in The Good because <i>Captain Marvel</i> used this feature well. It\u2019s always nice to see a visual medium like film use <i>visual storytelling</i> to great effect instead of having someone constantly dumping exposition all the time.</p><p>As a subset of the above, lack of exposition in a movie that is a plot-heavy as this one is always worth noting as praiseworthy.</p><p><br></p><p>The use of humor to break up the heavier scenes was a relief, and it often came when I least expected it. Real early in the movie there was this scene where \u201cVers\u201d was escaping the Skrull\u2019s and one of them does this growl at her and she growls back! It was such an absurd little moment of humanity and character that I lost it. And almost anything with that cat! I swear, how they made that monster scratching out Nick Furry\u2019s eye out into something hilarious, I\u2019ll never know! But they did, and all those little moments made this movie <i>shine</i>.</p><p><br></p><p>Real briefly, I\u2019d like to address a common complaint I\u2019ve heard against this movie, Carol\u2019s lack of character. These people are <i>full of fluff</i>. Is that it? Can I just leave it here? Do I really have to explain this? Yes?? *sigh* Okay.</p><p><br>The idea that Carol lacks character is born from her \u201creserved\u201d personality type. Now, I\u2019m not calling anyone sexist! But this is a personality type that is very often shown in Men\n\n<b>\u2122</b>\n\n, and it doesn\u2019t even raise an eyebrow. But to any dude who <i>actually is sexist</i>, and refuses to look at anything other than how large Brie Larson\u2019s chest is outside of her superhero suit, this personality type can easily be swapped out with a piece of cardboard and they wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>Now, guys have been pulling off this \u201ckind of quiet, but kind, but I\u2019ll seriously kick your ass if you mess with me,\u201d attitude in film for <i>ages</i>. And quite a few even have had success with it. (I\u2019m thinking Resse from <i>Person of Interest</i>, a show that is definitely getting its own review someday.) But it\u2019s exceedingly rare for a woman in film to have this personality type.</p><p>It\u2019s not uncommon in reality, however. And I, personally, like this touch of realism.</p><p>The few moments where Carol allowed herself to laugh felt warm and genuine. All her interactions with her niece were heartwarming. Again, some very important people, some of whom I even respect, say that the side characters never got a chance to shine, and Carol never got a chance to have a character arc.</p><p>But again, they\u2019re <i>full of fluff</i>. If anything, expressing emotion <i>was </i>Carol\u2019s character arc. By beating up the man in her life that insists that she never feel emotion, Carol shows that her emotions are her strengths and she does not at all have to prove herself to anyone.</p><p>Why?</p><p><i>Because she kept getting back up.</i></p><p>This is a powerful message to tell anyone. Not just women. We heard a variant of the same message in the Dark Knight trilogy. But in this one, it\u2019s even more satisfying because the people who kept knocking her down were <i>cheating to begin with.</i></p><p><i><br></i>Now, I\u2019m not going to say that this message was transferred across the eight sexes evenly. I have no doubt that women felt this message more acutely than men. This specific message was <i>made for women</i>. Duh. But there\u2019s only one reason why any man could come out of this film feeling attacked.</p><p><br>They saw themselves in Yon-Rogg.</p><p><br>I\u2019m just saying, if you related to the one male character that got attacked in this movie, <i>you prolly need to be offended</i>. Just a little. It\u2019s not going to kill you to take a hard look at yourself, even if you eventually discover that you have, in fact, been an ass at some point in your life.</p><p>Congratulations. Welcome to the human race. Now, <i>move on</i>.</p><p>Before we take our own advice and <i>move on</i>, I\u2019d like to address one more thing <i>Captain Marvel</i> did exceptionally well: The sound design.</p><p>This movie sounded wonderful, from the effects to the actual factual background music. Most notably in the third act. There was a point where a character said \u201cThe music is a nice touch\u201d and I agreed completely. A lot of these films use similar or recycled music to amp up \u201cthe moment\u201d but this movie\u2026 well, they didn\u2019t turn it up to eleven, but the got it up to ten.</p><p>They had music with lyrics, and that\u2019s more than 70% of movies these days. Thumbs up.</p><hr><p><b>The Bad</b>: Remember how I said I loved how engaging this plot was? It\u2019s still a freakishly dense plot! This whole thing was so tightly edited there was very little time to just unpack the things that happened. Often, you had to try and unpack the thing that just happened while actually doing the next thing.</p><p>This helps the movie be engaging. But it hamstrings it when it comes to actually following what\u2019s happening. There is just no way to condense this movie. I\u2019ve left out tons of stuff just because I have to stop typing this thing eventually!</p><hr><p><b>The Strange:</b> This part of the review is dedicated to the bizarre. To elements or ideas that seem half done, or just really questionable. Not usually bad enough to be constituted as a plot hole, these things are\u2026 just\u2026 things.</p><p>So, for example, the Kree team. What were their names? How many of them were there in the first place?</p><p>Don\u2019t know? Me neither, and I took notes when I watched this film. I remember Minn-Erva, the sniper, and Yon-Rogg the main villain. And if I\u2019m honest, I actually forgot their names and had to look it up. I didn\u2019t even know their group was called \u201cStarforce,\u201d until I discovered it looking for the correct way to spell their names.</p><p>This is not the best way to set up your main bad guys. Especially if your audience is supposed to care about them at all <i>for any reason</i>.</p><p>And while we\u2019re at it, the antagonist himself, Yon-Rogg, could do with a little bit extra development too. We don\u2019t really know much about him except that he thinks emotions are weaknesses in a fight, and that Carol using her full power is cheating.</p><p>We don\u2019t really know anything else about him, so there\u2019s no real sense of betrayal when Carol turns on him. The \u201cevil all along\u201d trope works best when it\u2019s a character you\u2019ve been with the whole story who\u2019s secretly had a plan the whole time. It works because you, the audience, feels betrayed too. Here\u2026 it just kinda happened. And, depending on how cynical you are, you probably even saw it coming.</p><p>It\u2019s like they were going for a sucker punch but aimed it at your forearm; doesn\u2019t really hurt, and does little to actually surprise us.</p><hr><p><b>Strongest Scene:</b> When making the strongest scene, I don\u2019t mean I look for the scenes with the most meaning packed into them. If I did, the climax or the Intro of a story would win every time. No, what I look for in a strong scene is pure storytelling. How is it shot, who is in it, how does it connect with the rest of the story, and how much does it say.</p><p>For <i>Captain Marvel</i>, my subjective vote goes to the bar scene between Nick Fury and \u201cVers.\u201d Even though they\u2019ve technically met already, the two are <i>really seeing each other</i> for the first time. Nick, newly awakened to the idea of aliens, and Vers, finally respecting Nick\u2019s skills as a competent agent despite his comparative backwater setting.</p><p>Nick realizes he\u2019s in about a mile over his head, and Vers realizes she can\u2019t work alone.</p><p>They have a nice discussion about their past and aliens, complete with its own little humorous jabs, and there\u2019s a very real sense that these two are full partners afterward that carries all along the rest of the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Weakest Scene:</b> As much as it saddens me to say this, I\u2019m going to have to put the introduction to the movie here.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, it does a fully competent job of setting up Vers and her amnesia. But we don\u2019t get a good sense of anyone else in Halla. To me, it\u2019s the things we <i>don\u2019t</i> see that really spoil this intro. We don\u2019t see any of Carol\u2019s friends, and the one guy we do see is in a bit of a mentor position. We don\u2019t see how people in this world live, and because of that, we don\u2019t get to know if the people of Halla are happy, or miserable. And while this does little for the plot of this movie, it would\u2019ve done marvels at giving the villains characterization or justifications.</p><p>Coulda, shoulda, woulda; didn\u2019t.</p><p>Luckily, I can gladly say that every other scene in this movie was made stronger than this one.</p><hr><p><b>Conclusion</b>:<i> Captain Marvel</i> is an excellent story from start to finish. Anyone who tells you otherwise is stuffed so<i> full of fluff </i>you can call them Whinee the Poo. And yes, that is my way of saying they\u2019re full of crap.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s a stigma around female characters that they\u2019re almost all considered Mary Sue\u2019s, and that being a Mary Sue is the WORST CRIME EVER!! But I never got that from Carol. Mostly because at every opportunity instead of powering her way through her problems, she had to cave and struggle and even fall.</p><p>And then she got back up.</p>",

By beating up the man in her life that insists that she never feel emotion, Carol shows that her emotions are her strengths and she does not at all have to prove herself to anyone.</p><p>Why?</p><p><i>Because she kept getting back up.</i></p><p>This is a powerful message to tell anyone. Not just women. We heard a variant of the same message in the Dark Knight trilogy. But in this one, it\u2019s even more satisfying because the people who kept knocking her down were <i>cheating to begin with.</i></p><p><i><br></i>Now, I\u2019m not going to say that this message was transferred across the eight sexes evenly. I have no doubt that women felt this message more acutely than men. This specific message was <i>made for women</i>. Duh. But there\u2019s only one reason why any man could come out of this film feeling attacked.</p><p><br>They saw themselves in Yon-Rogg.</p><p><br>I\u2019m just saying, if you related to the one male character that got attacked in this movie, <i>you prolly need to be offended</i>. Just a little. It\u2019s not going to kill you to take a hard look at yourself, even if you eventually discover that you have, in fact, been an ass at some point in your life.</p><p>Congratulations. Welcome to the human race. Now, <i>move on</i>.</p><p>Before we take our own advice and <i>move on</i>, I\u2019d like to address one more thing <i>Captain Marvel</i> did exceptionally well: The sound design.</p><p>This movie sounded wonderful, from the effects to the actual factual background music. Most notably in the third act. There was a point where a character said \u201cThe music is a nice touch\u201d and I agreed completely. A lot of these films use similar or recycled music to amp up \u201cthe moment\u201d but this movie\u2026 well, they didn\u2019t turn it up to eleven, but the got it up to ten.</p><p>They had music with lyrics, and that\u2019s more than 70% of movies these days. Thumbs up.</p><hr><p><b>The Bad</b>: Remember how I said I loved how engaging this plot was? It\u2019s still a freakishly dense plot! This whole thing was so tightly edited there was very little time to just unpack the things that happened. Often, you had to try and unpack the thing that just happened while actually doing the next thing.</p><p>This helps the movie be engaging. But it hamstrings it when it comes to actually following what\u2019s happening. There is just no way to condense this movie. I\u2019ve left out tons of stuff just because I have to stop typing this thing eventually!</p><hr><p><b>The Strange:</b> This part of the review is dedicated to the bizarre. To elements or ideas that seem half done, or just really questionable. Not usually bad enough to be constituted as a plot hole, these things are\u2026 just\u2026 things.</p><p>So, for example, the Kree team. What were their names? How many of them were there in the first place?</p><p>Don\u2019t know? Me neither, and I took notes when I watched this film. I remember Minn-Erva, the sniper, and Yon-Rogg the main villain. And if I\u2019m honest, I actually forgot their names and had to look it up. I didn\u2019t even know their group was called \u201cStarforce,\u201d until I discovered it looking for the correct way to spell their names.</p><p>This is not the best way to set up your main bad guys. Especially if your audience is supposed to care about them at all <i>for any reason</i>.</p><p>And while we\u2019re at it, the antagonist himself, Yon-Rogg, could do with a little bit extra development too. We don\u2019t really know much about him except that he thinks emotions are weaknesses in a fight, and that Carol using her full power is cheating.</p><p>We don\u2019t really know anything else about him, so there\u2019s no real sense of betrayal when Carol turns on him. The \u201cevil all along\u201d trope works best when it\u2019s a character you\u2019ve been with the whole story who\u2019s secretly had a plan the whole time.

And, depending on how cynical you are, you probably even saw it coming.</p><p>It\u2019s like they were going for a sucker punch but aimed it at your forearm; doesn\u2019t really hurt, and does little to actually surprise us.</p><hr><p><b>Strongest Scene:</b> When making the strongest scene, I don\u2019t mean I look for the scenes with the most meaning packed into them. If I did, the climax or the Intro of a story would win every time. No, what I look for in a strong scene is pure storytelling.

We don\u2019t see any of Carol\u2019s friends, and the one guy we do see is in a bit of a mentor position. We don\u2019t see how people in this world live, and because of that, we don\u2019t get to know if the people of Halla are happy, or miserable.

Today at JayWrites101 we&rsquo;re looking into the cinematic adventure that is<i> Captian Marvel</i>. Critics everywhere are pitching in on this one, giving it reviews ranging between Masterpiece and Disaster with very little room for leeway. How accurate are those reviews? Let&rsquo;s find out together.</p><p>The purpose of this review is not to promote, nor offend. We&rsquo;re here to break down The Good, The Bad, and The Strange to find out what makes this movie so unique.</p><p>Spoilers ahead.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: Movie<br /><b>Genre:</b> Superhero, action, drama<br /><b>Premise</b>: A superpowered woman with amnesia must find out the truth of who she is so she can stop an interstellar war from destroying her homeworld.</p><p><br />My, that&rsquo;s such a simple premise, isn&rsquo;t it? Boy, the context of this premise changes dramatically. Our Protagonist, Vers, starts off as a Kree soldier fighting to protect Halla from the Skrulls, big green aliens with the power to shape-shift into anyone. As more information is revealed, she ends as Carol Danvers (not to be confused with Karra Danvers, DC&rsquo;s Supergirl) a human pilot who absorbed a fraction of power from an infinity stone whose mission is to protect Earth from the Kree as they try to use her to take over the galaxy.</p><p>It&rsquo;s funny how the entire plot reverses itself completely, but the basic premise never changed.</p><hr /><p><b>Plot:</b> We start off learning about Vers, as she and her team gears up to rescue a spy whose cover has been blown. The mission turns into a complete fiasco when the spy turns out to be a Skrull in disguise. Vers is captured and &ldquo;interrogated&rdquo; using some kind of mind-reading technology. Thing is, she&rsquo;s remembering stuff she couldn&rsquo;t possibly have remembered. Things like getting chewed out for crashing a go-kart, or falling while doing a military course.<br />Vers manages to escape her captors and flee to Earth. After contacting her team, she joins forces with Nick Fury, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who&rsquo;s thinking about putting together a task force to protect the Earth from major threats. Not a bad idea, that.</p><p>Together they investigate the fragments of memory that Vers recalled from her capture, all while being chased relentlessly by Skrull agents who also made it to Earth. Vers eventually finds a friend who knows the truth and learns that she is, in fact, Carol Dan-vers, a human. Before this revelation has time to sink in, the Skrull offer a flag of truce. They reveal that they&rsquo;re not a military force, just a few survivors trying to hide from the Kree who hunt them relentlessly. As proof, they offer Carol a recording of the incident that robbed her of her memories where it&rsquo;s shown unarguably that her teammates, the Kree, deliberately captured her to find the Tesseract, a device that holds an Infinity Stone, and accidentally gave Carol her powers when she tried to destroy a device that used that energy.</p><p>In the end, Carol and her new friends are captured by the Kree and Carol realizes the device she believed was giving her power, was actually suppressing her powers. She destroys the device and becomes Captian Marvel, a superbeing whose massively undefined powers include energy blasts from her hands and flight. Powers that allow her to tear through a Kree spaceship like it was tissue paper. If you&rsquo;ve watched Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1. then you know these things are no joke, but Carol destroys one in three seconds flat by flying through it.</p><p>Bad guys leave, Carol takes the surviving Skrull to a new planet on the opposite side of the galaxy and Nick Fury begins his Avengers Initiative.<br />Fast forward to the Present and Carol returns in the end-credit scene to a very confused Captain America and demands to know what happened to Fury.</p><p>This was one heavy plot. I cut a lot out of it and it still took me thirty minutes to give a summary that wouldn&rsquo;t leave you more confused than you began. You wouldn&rsquo;t think this movie was so plot-dense until you have to try to explain it.</p><hr /><p><b>The Good:</b> I just broke down the plot, but what&rsquo;s great about <i>Captain Marvel</i> is that this plot is engaging. I had to go to the bathroom about a third of the way through the movie, but I didn&rsquo;t once consider <i>actually leaving</i> because every second of this movie was filled with something.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve heard it said before that a good plot structure is &ldquo;X happened because of Y and causes Z.&rdquo; There are precious few films that encapsulate that principle into the core of it&rsquo;s being better than <i>Captain Marvel</i>. And the nods to future films and plot points were fun to discover as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>Another thing worth noting is how much of the story is conveyed nonverbally. They spend a lot of effort to say as much as they can, using as little dialogue as possible. This helps the viewer to remember plot details better since they&rsquo;re not just passively listening, but it also means that removing attention away from the screen can cause you to miss things crucial to understanding what&rsquo;s going on.<br />I&rsquo;m leaving this in The Good because <i>Captain Marvel</i> used this feature well. It&rsquo;s always nice to see a visual medium like film use <i>visual storytelling</i> to great effect instead of having someone constantly dumping exposition all the time.</p><p>As a subset of the above, lack of exposition in a movie that is a plot-heavy as this one is always worth noting as praiseworthy.</p><p><br /></p><p>The use of humor to break up the heavier scenes was a relief, and it often came when I least expected it. Real early in the movie there was this scene where &ldquo;Vers&rdquo; was escaping the Skrull&rsquo;s and one of them does this growl at her and she growls back! It was such an absurd little moment of humanity and character that I lost it. And almost anything with that cat! I swear, how they made that monster scratching out Nick Furry&rsquo;s eye out into something hilarious, I&rsquo;ll never know! But they did, and all those little moments made this movie <i>shine</i>.</p><p><br /></p><p>Real briefly, I&rsquo;d like to address a common complaint I&rsquo;ve heard against this movie, Carol&rsquo;s lack of character. These people are <i>full of fluff</i>. Is that it? Can I just leave it here? Do I really have to explain this? Yes?? *sigh* Okay.</p><p><br />The idea that Carol lacks character is born from her &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; personality type. Now, I&rsquo;m not calling anyone sexist! But this is a personality type that is very often shown in Men\n\n<b>&trade;</b>\n\n, and it doesn&rsquo;t even raise an eyebrow. But to any dude who <i>actually is sexist</i>, and refuses to look at anything other than how large Brie Larson&rsquo;s chest is outside of her superhero suit, this personality type can easily be swapped out with a piece of cardboard and they wouldn&rsquo;t notice.</p><p>Now, guys have been pulling off this &ldquo;kind of quiet, but kind, but I&rsquo;ll seriously kick your ass if you mess with me,&rdquo; attitude in film for <i>ages</i>. And quite a few even have had success with it. (I&rsquo;m thinking Resse from <i>Person of Interest</i>, a show that is definitely getting its own review someday.) But it&rsquo;s exceedingly rare for a woman in film to have this personality type.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon in reality, however. And I, personally, like this touch of realism.</p><p>The few moments where Carol allowed herself to laugh felt warm and genuine. All her interactions with her niece were heartwarming. Again, some very important people, some of whom I even respect, say that the side characters never got a chance to shine, and Carol never got a chance to have a character arc.</p><p>But again, they&rsquo;re <i>full of fluff</i>. If anything, expressing emotion <i>was </i>Carol&rsquo;s character arc. By beating up the man in her life that insists that she never feel emotion, Carol shows that her emotions are her strengths and she does not at all have to prove herself to anyone.</p><p>Why?</p><p><i>Because she kept getting back up.</i></p><p>This is a powerful message to tell anyone.

Just a little. It&rsquo;s not going to kill you to take a hard look at yourself, even if you eventually discover that you have, in fact, been an ass at some point in your life.</p><p>Congratulations.
