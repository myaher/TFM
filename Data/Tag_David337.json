You try to negotiate with a killer.</b></p><p><b>Notes: This is the final part of this series, there may be more Alec x Daughter Reader stories, but I really hope you guys have enjoyed this. I love this show and I miss it!</b></p><p><b>Warnings: There is going to be a bit of gore in this one, so just be prepared.</b></p><hr><p><b><br/></b>You watched Joe pace around the room, twirling the knife around with one hand and holding the cell phone in the other. You felt your body shaking, every inch of you wishing that you could run as far away as possible. The ropes binding your hands dug into your wrists as you tried to wriggle them free. You stopped as soon as Joe\u2019s eyes landed on you.<b><br/></b></p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re quite a pretty little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He knelt down in front of you and ripped off the duct tape, causing you to wince. \u201cToo bad you look like your old man.\u201d He lifted your chin to look at him, forcing you to stand. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that now, won\u2019t we?\u201d You held your breath as he raised the knife to your face, dragging the blade just above your left eyebrow. You resisted the urge to cry out as blood began to drip down into your eye, making it hard to see.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was right. You don\u2019t have to do this. You can still get away before they find us.\u201d You tried to reason with him. He chuckled and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d his smile made you feel sick. \u201cThey won\u2019t find us. Not until I\u2019m finished with you. Now,\u201d He lowered the knife down to your lips, \u201clet\u2019s see what we can do about that mouth of yours.\u201d Just as he was about to make a cut, lights flashed by the window. He muttered to himself. \u201cShit.\u201d He set down the knife and went to the windows. You saw the knife on the table and snatched it up, carefully taking it in your hands and slowly sawing away at your restraints. He turned around just as you broke free, throwing open the doors and running out into the grass.</p><p>You only got a few yards away before he tackled you to the ground as you screamed as loud as your lungs could muster. He grabbed you by the hair and slammed your head into the dirt, enough to make your vision blur and your ears ring.</p><p>\u201cI know just what to do with you, you little bitch!\u201d Joe screamed into your ear, dragging you back inside as you clawed at the ground.</p><hr><p>Ellie stepped on the gas, the car zooming down the road. Alec was looking through files, trying to figure out what Joe meant.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He exclaimed, holding up a picture of the white cottage where Danny Latimer was killed. \u201cWhere it all started.\u201d Ellie nodded and made a sharp turn around a corner.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d She warned, speeding up the car.</p><p>When they reached the cottage, there was a single light on inside. Without even waiting for Ellie to park, Alec was running up the hill, pulling out his gun and raising it as he burst inside. That\u2019s when the screams started.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He called out, but there was no answer. Only the screams. He searched every inch of the cottage, but Joe was nowhere to be found and neither was Y/N. It wasn\u2019t until he checked the living room again that he realized where the screams were coming from. There was a tablet sitting on the table, playing a video on loop. Alec picked up the tablet and felt sick.</p><p>\u201cSay hello, Y/N.\u201d Joe sneered as he set up the tablet to film. You were in the background, pinned to the floor by Joe, who was kneeling above you. That&rsquo;s when he dug the knife into your arm. Alec could tell you were trying to fight him, trying to keep from crying out, but as he dragged the blade, blood starting to drip down your arm. But as he dug deeper, you started to scream.</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Ellie cried, looking at the video over Alec\u2019s shoulder. Joe carved and you continued to scream. Alec couldn\u2019t bear to watch but for some reason couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away. It was like he was frozen and all that he could hear was his little girl\u2019s pain. When he was finished, Joe picked up the tablet.</p><p>\u201cI think I did pretty well, what about you Alec?\u201d He sneered, focusing on the bloody letters carved in your arm. <i>Payback</i>. At this point, you had stopped screaming. You were hunched on the ground, crying into the sleeve of your school uniform. Joe grabbed a fistful of your hair and yanked you up so that you were sitting, your bruised and bloodied face facing the camera. \u201cSay goodbye to daddy, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>The video started to replay, but Ellie grabbed the tablet from Alec&rsquo;s hands, stuffing it into an evidence bag as quickly as she could. Alec clenched his fists.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard.\u201d He growled, but beneath his rage was a feeling of hopelessness. \u201cHe could be anywhere. What if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t you dare start talking like that.\u201d Ellie snapped. \u201cWe are going to find her, Alec.\u201d She placed an assuring hand on his shoulder and he let out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cDid she know?\u201d He wondered quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ellie looked down at him and saw a look of sadness in his eyes like she&rsquo;d never seen in him before.</p><p>\u201cDid Y/N know that I loved her?\u201d His voice broke and a tear fell down his face. She&rsquo;d never seen him cry before and it broke her heart. This strong man that she looked up to- not that she&rsquo;d tell him that- was broken.</p><p>\u201cOf course she knew. And we can&rsquo;t give up yet.\u201d Ellie racked her brain, thinking of all the possibilities of where they could have gone. She thought back to something she saw at the end of the video. Slowly, she grabbed the tablet again and played the last few seconds.</p><p>\u201cLook there.\u201d She pointed to a reflection in the window. Headlights. \u201cHe must have just taken this because that&rsquo;s our car.\u201d Realization washed over Alec. \u201cAnd since we didn&rsquo;t see anyone leaving, that means that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey&rsquo;re still here.\u201d The two listened carefully to the silence around them. Then the sound of a door slamming and feet running had the detectives sprinting after them. Joe was dragging you behind him when you heard your father calling your name.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d You yelled back into the night, two shadowing figures chasing after you. Joe pulled you forward, but you planted your feet. If you could just buy yourself enough time for them to catch up. It was the end of the line and Joe knew it. He yanked you to him, wrapping an arm around your stomach and placing the knife against your throat.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d He snarled in your ear, backing up further to the edge of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d Alec shouted, catching up. He had a gun raised, but his eyes grew wide when he saw the blade at your neck. \u201cDon\u2019t do this Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to fucking do.\u201d He growled, stepping back again.. You heard the sea roll beneath you and held your breath.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d You cried, reaching your hand out towards him. Joe tightened his hold on you, applying enough pressure on the knife to draw blood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d He screamed at Alec. Ellie looked at the man she used to love.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you become?\u201d She asked, her voice filled with disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou did this to me.\u201d He spat. \u201cThis town turned me into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed an eleven-year-old boy.\u201d She said, taking a step forward. \u201cYou killed your son\u2019s best friend.\u201d Through all of this, your father kept his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d He assured you, trying not to look at the blood still dripping down your arm.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn&rsquo;t lie to the poor girl.\u201d Joe laughed darkly. \u201cShe&rsquo;s been through enough tonight.\u201d Alec shifted his gaze, his eyes blazing as he raised his gun to Joe&rsquo;s head.</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d He ordered. \u201cThis can only end two ways for you, in the station or at the bottom of that cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you&rsquo;re so clever, don&rsquo;t you?\u201d He moved his arm from your stomach, giving you an opportunity to shove away from him. Everything happened so fast after that. As you tried to escape his grasp, he swung the knife at you. But before he could reach you, an ear-splitting sound rang through the air.

As his final act of revenge, his hand wrapped around your ankle dragging you down with him.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201dAlec screamed, diving down as you clawed the grass, trying to grab onto something. But Joe&rsquo;s weight pulled you down as he held onto your foot. You looked down at the man who had put you through so much pain, the man who had killed Danny Latimer. You used all your strength to kick your foot down into his face and felt his hold on you slip. You were able to barely latch onto the edge of the cliff as Joe fell, his body hitting the ground with an awful thud.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at him, sweetheart,\u201d Ellie said, reaching out for you next to Alec. The rock beneath your hands started to crumble and you fell further towards the ground below.</p><p>\u201cTake my hand!\u201d Alec called over the roaring waves below. You hesitated. If you let go of the cliff, you would fall. Your father looked down at you, desperation in his eyes. \u201cI need you to take my hand, darling.\u201d The wind whipped at your hair, loose strands sticking to the tears that streamed down your cheeks. The rest of the cliff gave away and before you could fall, you grabbed your father\u2019s hand.</p><p>Alec pulled you back up onto the cliff, making sure you were safe on stable ground before pulling you into his arms. You latched onto him, crying into his suit jacket. Ellie knelt down beside you, running a comforting hand up and down your arm, careful not to touch your bleeding wound, as your father cradled to back of your head.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you.\u201d Alec sighed into your hair. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you go blaming yourself now.\u201d You ordered, pushing away to look at him. \u201cWhat matters is that you\u2019re here and you found me. It\u2019s alright. I\u2019m alright.\u201d Alec smiled at you and pulled you back into a hug, swearing to himself that he\u2019d never let anything happen to you for as long as he lived.</p><p>\u201cMy brave girl.\u201d</p><hr><p>Three Weeks Later</p><p>\tYou stared out at the horizon, feeling the peaceful breeze blow through your hair and listening to the waves hit the sand. You took a deep breath in. And a deep breath out. It had been your first day back at school. It hadn\u2019t gone as bad as you expected. You were able to ignore the stares and whispers. But it was nice to have some peace and quiet.</p><p>\t\u201cHow\u2019d it go today?\u201d Beth wondered. Ever since the incident, you\u2019d been meeting up with Beth Latimer twice a week, or whenever you needed it.</p><p>\t\u201cAlright.\u201d You shrugged and quietly added. \u201cI was worried about dad.\u201d Beth chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cDoes he still have you on a leash?\u201d She joked. Alec was the one who\u2019d asked her to speak with you in the first place. She was glad that he did.</p><p>\t\u201cHe barely lets me leave the house.\u201d You exclaimed and the two of you laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s getting better, though. And I know why he does it, but sometimes I just need to be alone.\u201d You turned your head to the cliffs and closed your eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you still having the dreams?\u201d Beth asked gently. You sighed and nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cThey\u2019re getting less frequent, but it\u2019s still hard to sleep.\u201d Almost every night you\u2019d woken up screaming with Alec rushing into your room to comfort you. But you were getting better.</p><p>\t\u201cThe nightmares might never stop.\u201d Beth put a hand on your shoulder. \u201cBut you are a strong, beautiful girl. You\u2019ll learn how to fight them. You\u2019ve already come so far. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d She gave you a smile and pulled you in for a hug. Your phone buzzed with a text. You shook your head and grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Dad\u2019s buying us ice cream.\u201d You waved goodbye as you walked towards your dad\u2019s car.</p><p>\t\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d He asked as you got in. You shot him a look.</p><p>\t\u201cYou know you\u2019re not supposed to ask about it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not asking about it!\u201d He defended. \u201cI just want to know how you\u2019re doing.\u201d You rolled your eyes and gave him a peck on the cheek.</p><p>\t\u201cIt was nice.\u201d You buckled the seatbelt as he started down the road. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been having me see Beth.

She\u2019s been asking about you.\u201d You smirked.</p><p>\t\u201cAs long as you two don\u2019t start bickering about who pays again.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWe don\u2019t bicker. We\u2026 debate.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhatever you say, dad.\u201d You snickered. As the two of you got out of the car, Ellie joined you from hers. It was getting warm out so you took of the jacket you were wearing but paused, looking down at your exposed arm. The marks were still an angry red and they\u2019d started to scar. You remembered everything Beth had told you about fighting it and not letting him get in your head. About turning the word against him. Make your survival and triumphs your own payback against him and his failure to destroy you.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Alec asked, his brows knitted together with worry. You looked up at him and smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI think for the first time in three weeks I can honestly say that I am.\u201d He gave you his usual awkward smile and put an arm around you in a kind of side hug.

Without even waiting for Ellie to park, Alec was running up the hill, pulling out his gun and raising it as he burst inside. That\u2019s when the screams started.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He called out, but there was no answer. Only the screams. He searched every inch of the cottage, but Joe was nowhere to be found and neither was Y/N. It wasn\u2019t until he checked the living room again that he realized where the screams were coming from. There was a tablet sitting on the table, playing a video on loop. Alec picked up the tablet and felt sick.</p><p>\u201cSay hello, Y/N.\u201d Joe sneered as he set up the tablet to film. You were in the background, pinned to the floor by Joe, who was kneeling above you. That\u2019s when he dug the knife into your arm. Alec could tell you were trying to fight him, trying to keep from crying out, but as he dragged the blade, blood starting to drip down your arm. But as he dug deeper, you started to scream.</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Ellie cried, looking at the video over Alec\u2019s shoulder. Joe carved and you continued to scream. Alec couldn\u2019t bear to watch but for some reason couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away. It was like he was frozen and all that he could hear was his little girl\u2019s pain. When he was finished, Joe picked up the tablet.</p><p>\u201cI think I did pretty well, what about you Alec?\u201d He sneered, focusing on the bloody letters carved in your arm. <i>Payback</i>. At this point, you had stopped screaming. You were hunched on the ground, crying into the sleeve of your school uniform. Joe grabbed a fistful of your hair and yanked you up so that you were sitting, your bruised and bloodied face facing the camera. \u201cSay goodbye to daddy, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>The video started to replay, but Ellie grabbed the tablet from Alec\u2019s hands, stuffing it into an evidence bag as quickly as she could. Alec clenched his fists.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard.\u201d He growled, but beneath his rage was a feeling of hopelessness. \u201cHe could be anywhere. What if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare start talking like that.\u201d Ellie snapped. \u201cWe are going to find her, Alec.\u201d She placed an assuring hand on his shoulder and he let out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cDid she know?\u201d He wondered quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ellie looked down at him and saw a look of sadness in his eyes like she\u2019d never seen in him before.</p><p>\u201cDid Y/N know that I loved her?\u201d His voice broke and a tear fell down his face. She\u2019d never seen him cry before and it broke her heart. This strong man that she looked up to- not that she\u2019d tell him that- was broken.</p><p>\u201cOf course she knew. And we can\u2019t give up yet.\u201d Ellie racked her brain, thinking of all the possibilities of where they could have gone. She thought back to something she saw at the end of the video. Slowly, she grabbed the tablet again and played the last few seconds.</p><p>\u201cLook there.\u201d She pointed to a reflection in the window. Headlights. \u201cHe must have just taken this because that\u2019s our car.\u201d Realization washed over Alec. \u201cAnd since we didn\u2019t see anyone leaving, that means that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still here.\u201d The two listened carefully to the silence around them. Then the sound of a door slamming and feet running had the detectives sprinting after them. Joe was dragging you behind him when you heard your father calling your name.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d You yelled back into the night, two shadowing figures chasing after you. Joe pulled you forward, but you planted your feet. If you could just buy yourself enough time for them to catch up. It was the end of the line and Joe knew it. He yanked you to him, wrapping an arm around your stomach and placing the knife against your throat.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d He snarled in your ear, backing up further to the edge of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d Alec shouted, catching up. He had a gun raised, but his eyes grew wide when he saw the blade at your neck. \u201cDon\u2019t do this Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to fucking do.\u201d He growled, stepping back again.. You heard the sea roll beneath you and held your breath.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d You cried, reaching your hand out towards him. Joe tightened his hold on you, applying enough pressure on the knife to draw blood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d He screamed at Alec. Ellie looked at the man she used to love.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you become?\u201d She asked, her voice filled with disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou did this to me.\u201d He spat. \u201cThis town turned me into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed an eleven-year-old boy.\u201d She said, taking a step forward. \u201cYou killed your son\u2019s best friend.\u201d Through all of this, your father kept his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d He assured you, trying not to look at the blood still dripping down your arm.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to the poor girl.\u201d Joe laughed darkly. \u201cShe\u2019s been through enough tonight.\u201d Alec shifted his gaze, his eyes blazing as he raised his gun to Joe\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d He ordered. \u201cThis can only end two ways for you, in the station or at the bottom of that cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so clever, don\u2019t you?\u201d He moved his arm from your stomach, giving you an opportunity to shove away from him. Everything happened so fast after that. As you tried to escape his grasp, he swung the knife at you. But before he could reach you, an ear-splitting sound rang through the air. Alec had fired into Joe\u2019s left shoulder, causing him to stumble backward over the cliff. As his final act of revenge, his hand wrapped around your ankle dragging you down with him.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201dAlec screamed, diving down as you clawed the grass, trying to grab onto something. But Joe\u2019s weight pulled you down as he held onto your foot. You looked down at the man who had put you through so much pain, the man who had killed Danny Latimer. You used all your strength to kick your foot down into his face and felt his hold on you slip. You were able to barely latch onto the edge of the cliff as Joe fell, his body hitting the ground with an awful thud.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at him, sweetheart,\u201d Ellie said, reaching out for you next to Alec. The rock beneath your hands started to crumble and you fell further towards the ground below.</p><p>\u201cTake my hand!\u201d Alec called over the roaring waves below. You hesitated. If you let go of the cliff, you would fall. Your father looked down at you, desperation in his eyes. \u201cI need you to take my hand, darling.\u201d The wind whipped at your hair, loose strands sticking to the tears that streamed down your cheeks. The rest of the cliff gave away and before you could fall, you grabbed your father\u2019s hand.</p><p>Alec pulled you back up onto the cliff, making sure you were safe on stable ground before pulling you into his arms. You latched onto him, crying into his suit jacket. Ellie knelt down beside you, running a comforting hand up and down your arm, careful not to touch your bleeding wound, as your father cradled to back of your head.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you.\u201d Alec sighed into your hair. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you go blaming yourself now.\u201d You ordered, pushing away to look at him. \u201cWhat matters is that you\u2019re here and you found me. It\u2019s alright. I\u2019m alright.\u201d Alec smiled at you and pulled you back into a hug, swearing to himself that he\u2019d never let anything happen to you for as long as he lived.</p><p>\u201cMy brave girl.\u201d</p><hr><p>Three Weeks Later</p><p>\tYou stared out at the horizon, feeling the peaceful breeze blow through your hair and listening to the waves hit the sand.

You felt your body shaking, every inch of you wishing that you could run as far away as possible. The ropes binding your hands dug into your wrists as you tried to wriggle them free. You stopped as soon as Joe\u2019s eyes landed on you.<b><br></b></p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re quite a pretty little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He knelt down in front of you and ripped off the duct tape, causing you to wince. \u201cToo bad you look like your old man.\u201d He lifted your chin to look at him, forcing you to stand. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that now, won\u2019t we?\u201d You held your breath as he raised the knife to your face, dragging the blade just above your left eyebrow. You resisted the urge to cry out as blood began to drip down into your eye, making it hard to see.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was right. You don\u2019t have to do this. You can still get away before they find us.\u201d You tried to reason with him. He chuckled and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d his smile made you feel sick. \u201cThey won\u2019t find us. Not until I\u2019m finished with you. Now,\u201d He lowered the knife down to your lips, \u201clet\u2019s see what we can do about that mouth of yours.\u201d Just as he was about to make a cut, lights flashed by the window. He muttered to himself. \u201cShit.\u201d He set down the knife and went to the windows. You saw the knife on the table and snatched it up, carefully taking it in your hands and slowly sawing away at your restraints. He turned around just as you broke free, throwing open the doors and running out into the grass.</p><p>You only got a few yards away before he tackled you to the ground as you screamed as loud as your lungs could muster. He grabbed you by the hair and slammed your head into the dirt, enough to make your vision blur and your ears ring.</p><p>\u201cI know just what to do with you, you little bitch!\u201d Joe screamed into your ear, dragging you back inside as you clawed at the ground.</p><hr><p>Ellie stepped on the gas, the car zooming down the road. Alec was looking through files, trying to figure out what Joe meant.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He exclaimed, holding up a picture of the white cottage where Danny Latimer was killed. \u201cWhere it all started.\u201d Ellie nodded and made a sharp turn around a corner.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d She warned, speeding up the car.</p><p>When they reached the cottage, there was a single light on inside. Without even waiting for Ellie to park, Alec was running up the hill, pulling out his gun and raising it as he burst inside. That\u2019s when the screams started.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He called out, but there was no answer. Only the screams. He searched every inch of the cottage, but Joe was nowhere to be found and neither was Y/N. It wasn\u2019t until he checked the living room again that he realized where the screams were coming from. There was a tablet sitting on the table, playing a video on loop. Alec picked up the tablet and felt sick.</p><p>\u201cSay hello, Y/N.\u201d Joe sneered as he set up the tablet to film. You were in the background, pinned to the floor by Joe, who was kneeling above you. That\u2019s when he dug the knife into your arm. Alec could tell you were trying to fight him, trying to keep from crying out, but as he dragged the blade, blood starting to drip down your arm. But as he dug deeper, you started to scream.</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Ellie cried, looking at the video over Alec\u2019s shoulder. Joe carved and you continued to scream. Alec couldn\u2019t bear to watch but for some reason couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away. It was like he was frozen and all that he could hear was his little girl\u2019s pain. When he was finished, Joe picked up the tablet.</p><p>\u201cI think I did pretty well, what about you Alec?\u201d He sneered, focusing on the bloody letters carved in your arm. <i>Payback</i>. At this point, you had stopped screaming. You were hunched on the ground, crying into the sleeve of your school uniform. Joe grabbed a fistful of your hair and yanked you up so that you were sitting, your bruised and bloodied face facing the camera. \u201cSay goodbye to daddy, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>The video started to replay, but Ellie grabbed the tablet from Alec\u2019s hands, stuffing it into an evidence bag as quickly as she could. Alec clenched his fists.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard.\u201d He growled, but beneath his rage was a feeling of hopelessness. \u201cHe could be anywhere. What if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare start talking like that.\u201d Ellie snapped. \u201cWe are going to find her, Alec.\u201d She placed an assuring hand on his shoulder and he let out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cDid she know?\u201d He wondered quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ellie looked down at him and saw a look of sadness in his eyes like she\u2019d never seen in him before.</p><p>\u201cDid Y/N know that I loved her?\u201d His voice broke and a tear fell down his face. She\u2019d never seen him cry before and it broke her heart. This strong man that she looked up to- not that she\u2019d tell him that- was broken.</p><p>\u201cOf course she knew. And we can\u2019t give up yet.\u201d Ellie racked her brain, thinking of all the possibilities of where they could have gone. She thought back to something she saw at the end of the video. Slowly, she grabbed the tablet again and played the last few seconds.</p><p>\u201cLook there.\u201d She pointed to a reflection in the window. Headlights. \u201cHe must have just taken this because that\u2019s our car.\u201d Realization washed over Alec. \u201cAnd since we didn\u2019t see anyone leaving, that means that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still here.\u201d The two listened carefully to the silence around them. Then the sound of a door slamming and feet running had the detectives sprinting after them. Joe was dragging you behind him when you heard your father calling your name.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d You yelled back into the night, two shadowing figures chasing after you. Joe pulled you forward, but you planted your feet. If you could just buy yourself enough time for them to catch up. It was the end of the line and Joe knew it. He yanked you to him, wrapping an arm around your stomach and placing the knife against your throat.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d He snarled in your ear, backing up further to the edge of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d Alec shouted, catching up. He had a gun raised, but his eyes grew wide when he saw the blade at your neck. \u201cDon\u2019t do this Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to fucking do.\u201d He growled, stepping back again.. You heard the sea roll beneath you and held your breath.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d You cried, reaching your hand out towards him. Joe tightened his hold on you, applying enough pressure on the knife to draw blood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d He screamed at Alec. Ellie looked at the man she used to love.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you become?\u201d She asked, her voice filled with disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou did this to me.\u201d He spat. \u201cThis town turned me into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed an eleven-year-old boy.\u201d She said, taking a step forward. \u201cYou killed your son\u2019s best friend.\u201d Through all of this, your father kept his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d He assured you, trying not to look at the blood still dripping down your arm.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to the poor girl.\u201d Joe laughed darkly. \u201cShe\u2019s been through enough tonight.\u201d Alec shifted his gaze, his eyes blazing as he raised his gun to Joe\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d He ordered. \u201cThis can only end two ways for you, in the station or at the bottom of that cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so clever, don\u2019t you?\u201d He moved his arm from your stomach, giving you an opportunity to shove away from him. Everything happened so fast after that. As you tried to escape his grasp, he swung the knife at you. But before he could reach you, an ear-splitting sound rang through the air. Alec had fired into Joe\u2019s left shoulder, causing him to stumble backward over the cliff. As his final act of revenge, his hand wrapped around your ankle dragging you down with him.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201dAlec screamed, diving down as you clawed the grass, trying to grab onto something. But Joe\u2019s weight pulled you down as he held onto your foot. You looked down at the man who had put you through so much pain, the man who had killed Danny Latimer. You used all your strength to kick your foot down into his face and felt his hold on you slip. You were able to barely latch onto the edge of the cliff as Joe fell, his body hitting the ground with an awful thud.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at him, sweetheart,\u201d Ellie said, reaching out for you next to Alec. The rock beneath your hands started to crumble and you fell further towards the ground below.</p><p>\u201cTake my hand!\u201d Alec called over the roaring waves below. You hesitated. If you let go of the cliff, you would fall. Your father looked down at you, desperation in his eyes. \u201cI need you to take my hand, darling.\u201d The wind whipped at your hair, loose strands sticking to the tears that streamed down your cheeks. The rest of the cliff gave away and before you could fall, you grabbed your father\u2019s hand.</p><p>Alec pulled you back up onto the cliff, making sure you were safe on stable ground before pulling you into his arms. You latched onto him, crying into his suit jacket. Ellie knelt down beside you, running a comforting hand up and down your arm, careful not to touch your bleeding wound, as your father cradled to back of your head.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you.\u201d Alec sighed into your hair. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you go blaming yourself now.\u201d You ordered, pushing away to look at him. \u201cWhat matters is that you\u2019re here and you found me. It\u2019s alright. I\u2019m alright.\u201d Alec smiled at you and pulled you back into a hug, swearing to himself that he\u2019d never let anything happen to you for as long as he lived.</p><p>\u201cMy brave girl.\u201d</p><hr><p>Three Weeks Later</p><p>\tYou stared out at the horizon, feeling the peaceful breeze blow through your hair and listening to the waves hit the sand. You took a deep breath in. And a deep breath out. It had been your first day back at school. It hadn\u2019t gone as bad as you expected. You were able to ignore the stares and whispers. But it was nice to have some peace and quiet.</p><p>\t\u201cHow\u2019d it go today?\u201d Beth wondered. Ever since the incident, you\u2019d been meeting up with Beth Latimer twice a week, or whenever you needed it.</p><p>\t\u201cAlright.\u201d You shrugged and quietly added. \u201cI was worried about dad.\u201d Beth chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cDoes he still have you on a leash?\u201d She joked. Alec was the one who\u2019d asked her to speak with you in the first place. She was glad that he did.</p><p>\t\u201cHe barely lets me leave the house.\u201d You exclaimed and the two of you laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s getting better, though. And I know why he does it, but sometimes I just need to be alone.\u201d You turned your head to the cliffs and closed your eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you still having the dreams?\u201d Beth asked gently. You sighed and nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cThey\u2019re getting less frequent, but it\u2019s still hard to sleep.\u201d Almost every night you\u2019d woken up screaming with Alec rushing into your room to comfort you. But you were getting better.</p><p>\t\u201cThe nightmares might never stop.\u201d Beth put a hand on your shoulder. \u201cBut you are a strong, beautiful girl. You\u2019ll learn how to fight them. You\u2019ve already come so far. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d She gave you a smile and pulled you in for a hug. Your phone buzzed with a text. You shook your head and grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Dad\u2019s buying us ice cream.\u201d You waved goodbye as you walked towards your dad\u2019s car.</p><p>\t\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d He asked as you got in. You shot him a look.</p><p>\t\u201cYou know you\u2019re not supposed to ask about it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not asking about it!\u201d He defended. \u201cI just want to know how you\u2019re doing.\u201d You rolled your eyes and gave him a peck on the cheek.</p><p>\t\u201cIt was nice.\u201d You buckled the seatbelt as he started down the road. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been having me see Beth. She\u2019s really great.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d He nodded. He took a deep breath. \u201cDo you mind if Miller comes with us? She\u2019s been asking about you.\u201d You smirked.</p><p>\t\u201cAs long as you two don\u2019t start bickering about who pays again.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWe don\u2019t bicker. We\u2026 debate.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhatever you say, dad.\u201d You snickered. As the two of you got out of the car, Ellie joined you from hers. It was getting warm out so you took of the jacket you were wearing but paused, looking down at your exposed arm. The marks were still an angry red and they\u2019d started to scar. You remembered everything Beth had told you about fighting it and not letting him get in your head. About turning the word against him. Make your survival and triumphs your own payback against him and his failure to destroy you.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Alec asked, his brows knitted together with worry. You looked up at him and smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI think for the first time in three weeks I can honestly say that I am.\u201d He gave you his usual awkward smile and put an arm around you in a kind of side hug. You laughed to yourself at his awkwardness but loved it all the same. The three of you walked up to the booth, Ellie and you teasing your dad about his tense nature and of course, they still argued about who would pay. And you felt safe.</p></p>",

He had a gun raised, but his eyes grew wide when he saw the blade at your neck. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this Joe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what to fucking do.&rdquo; He growled, stepping back again.. You heard the sea roll beneath you and held your breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; You cried, reaching your hand out towards him. Joe tightened his hold on you, applying enough pressure on the knife to draw blood.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come any closer!&rdquo; He screamed at Alec. Ellie looked at the man she used to love.</p><p>&ldquo;What have you become?&rdquo; She asked, her voice filled with disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;You did this to me.&rdquo; He spat. &ldquo;This town turned me into this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You killed an eleven-year-old boy.&rdquo; She said, taking a step forward. &ldquo;You killed your son&rsquo;s best friend.&rdquo; Through all of this, your father kept his eyes on you.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo; He assured you, trying not to look at the blood still dripping down your arm.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to the poor girl.&rdquo; Joe laughed darkly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been through enough tonight.&rdquo; Alec shifted his gaze, his eyes blazing as he raised his gun to Joe&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;Let her go.&rdquo; He ordered. &ldquo;This can only end two ways for you, in the station or at the bottom of that cliff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re so clever, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He moved his arm from your stomach, giving you an opportunity to shove away from him. Everything happened so fast after that. As you tried to escape his grasp, he swung the knife at you. But before he could reach you, an ear-splitting sound rang through the air. Alec had fired into Joe&rsquo;s left shoulder, causing him to stumble backward over the cliff. As his final act of revenge, his hand wrapped around your ankle dragging you down with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;Alec screamed, diving down as you clawed the grass, trying to grab onto something. But Joe&rsquo;s weight pulled you down as he held onto your foot. You looked down at the man who had put you through so much pain, the man who had killed Danny Latimer. You used all your strength to kick your foot down into his face and felt his hold on you slip. You were able to barely latch onto the edge of the cliff as Joe fell, his body hitting the ground with an awful thud.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at him, sweetheart,&rdquo; Ellie said, reaching out for you next to Alec. The rock beneath your hands started to crumble and you fell further towards the ground below.</p><p>&ldquo;Take my hand!&rdquo; Alec called over the roaring waves below. You hesitated. If you let go of the cliff, you would fall. Your father looked down at you, desperation in his eyes. &ldquo;I need you to take my hand, darling.&rdquo; The wind whipped at your hair, loose strands sticking to the tears that streamed down your cheeks. The rest of the cliff gave away and before you could fall, you grabbed your father&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Alec pulled you back up onto the cliff, making sure you were safe on stable ground before pulling you into his arms. You latched onto him, crying into his suit jacket. Ellie knelt down beside you, running a comforting hand up and down your arm, careful not to touch your bleeding wound, as your father cradled to back of your head.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d lost you.&rdquo; Alec sighed into your hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go blaming yourself now.&rdquo; You ordered, pushing away to look at him. &ldquo;What matters is that you&rsquo;re here and you found me. It&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;m alright.&rdquo; Alec smiled at you and pulled you back into a hug, swearing to himself that he&rsquo;d never let anything happen to you for as long as he lived.</p><p>&ldquo;My brave girl.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Three Weeks Later</p><p>\tYou stared out at the horizon, feeling the peaceful breeze blow through your hair and listening to the waves hit the sand. You took a deep breath in. And a deep breath out. It had been your first day back at school. It hadn&rsquo;t gone as bad as you expected. You were able to ignore the stares and whispers. But it was nice to have some peace and quiet.</p><p>\t&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it go today?&rdquo; Beth wondered. Ever since the incident, you&rsquo;d been meeting up with Beth Latimer twice a week, or whenever you needed it.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; You shrugged and quietly added. &ldquo;I was worried about dad.&rdquo; Beth chuckled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Does he still have you on a leash?&rdquo; She joked. Alec was the one who&rsquo;d asked her to speak with you in the first place. She was glad that he did.</p><p>\t&ldquo;He barely lets me leave the house.&rdquo; You exclaimed and the two of you laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting better, though. And I know why he does it, but sometimes I just need to be alone.&rdquo; You turned your head to the cliffs and closed your eyes.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you still having the dreams?&rdquo; Beth asked gently. You sighed and nodded.</p><p>\t&ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting less frequent, but it&rsquo;s still hard to sleep.&rdquo; Almost every night you&rsquo;d woken up screaming with Alec rushing into your room to comfort you. But you were getting better.</p><p>\t&ldquo;The nightmares might never stop.&rdquo; Beth put a hand on your shoulder. &ldquo;But you are a strong, beautiful girl. You&rsquo;ll learn how to fight them. You&rsquo;ve already come so far. I&rsquo;m so proud of you.&rdquo; She gave you a smile and pulled you in for a hug. Your phone buzzed with a text. You shook your head and grinned.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go. Dad&rsquo;s buying us ice cream.&rdquo; You waved goodbye as you walked towards your dad&rsquo;s car.</p><p>\t&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it go?&rdquo; He asked as you got in. You shot him a look.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re not supposed to ask about it.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking about it!&rdquo; He defended. &ldquo;I just want to know how you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; You rolled your eyes and gave him a peck on the cheek.</p><p>\t&ldquo;It was nice.&rdquo; You buckled the seatbelt as he started down the road. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve been having me see Beth. She&rsquo;s really great.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; He nodded. He took a deep breath. &ldquo;Do you mind if Miller comes with us? She&rsquo;s been asking about you.&rdquo; You smirked.</p><p>\t&ldquo;As long as you two don&rsquo;t start bickering about who pays again.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t bicker. We&hellip; debate.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Whatever you say, dad.&rdquo; You snickered. As the two of you got out of the car, Ellie joined you from hers. It was getting warm out so you took of the jacket you were wearing but paused, looking down at your exposed arm. The marks were still an angry red and they&rsquo;d started to scar. You remembered everything Beth had told you about fighting it and not letting him get in your head. About turning the word against him. Make your survival and triumphs your own payback against him and his failure to destroy you.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Alec asked, his brows knitted together with worry. You looked up at him and smiled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I think for the first time in three weeks I can honestly say that I am.&rdquo; He gave you his usual awkward smile and put an arm around you in a kind of side hug. You laughed to yourself at his awkwardness but loved it all the same. The three of you walked up to the booth, Ellie and you teasing your dad about his tense nature and of course, they still argued about who would pay. And you felt safe.</p></p>",

I love this show and I miss it!</b></p>\n<p><b>Warnings: There is going to be a bit of gore in this one, so just be prepared.</b></p>\n<hr />\n<p><b><br /></b>You watched Joe pace around the room, twirling the knife around with one hand and holding the cell phone in the other. You felt your body shaking, every inch of you wishing that you could run as far away as possible. The ropes binding your hands dug into your wrists as you tried to wriggle them free. You stopped as soon as Joe&rsquo;s eyes landed on you.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a pretty little thing, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He knelt down in front of you and ripped off the duct tape, causing you to wince. &ldquo;Too bad you look like your old man.&rdquo; He lifted your chin to look at him, forcing you to stand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of that now, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; You held your breath as he raised the knife to your face, dragging the blade just above your left eyebrow. You resisted the urge to cry out as blood began to drip down into your eye, making it hard to see.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My dad was right. You don&rsquo;t have to do this. You can still get away before they find us.&rdquo; You tried to reason with him. He chuckled and shook his head.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh sweetheart,&rdquo; his smile made you feel sick. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t find us. Not until I&rsquo;m finished with you. Now,&rdquo; He lowered the knife down to your lips, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see what we can do about that mouth of yours.&rdquo; Just as he was about to make a cut, lights flashed by the window. He muttered to himself. &ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; He set down the knife and went to the windows. You saw the knife on the table and snatched it up, carefully taking it in your hands and slowly sawing away at your restraints. He turned around just as you broke free, throwing open the doors and running out into the grass.</p>\n<p>You only got a few yards away before he tackled you to the ground as you screamed as loud as your lungs could muster. He grabbed you by the hair and slammed your head into the dirt, enough to make your vision blur and your ears ring.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know just what to do with you, you little bitch!&rdquo; Joe screamed into your ear, dragging you back inside as you clawed at the ground.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ellie stepped on the gas, the car zooming down the road. Alec was looking through files, trying to figure out what Joe meant.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He exclaimed, holding up a picture of the white cottage where Danny Latimer was killed. &ldquo;Where it all started.&rdquo; Ellie nodded and made a sharp turn around a corner.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo; She warned, speeding up the car.</p>\n<p>When they reached the cottage, there was a single light on inside. Without even waiting for Ellie to park, Alec was running up the hill, pulling out his gun and raising it as he burst inside. That&rsquo;s when the screams started.</p>\n</p>",
