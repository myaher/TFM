This is a nostalgic fic based on the day of their wedding :)  </b></p><p>Mere hours before the ceremony begins, Jon finds Sansa in her old chambers, her head bent over her finished work, fawning like a proud mother of a newborn babe. He thinks of how endearing the picture is: early morning rays laving the room in a burnished glow, new d\u00e9cor on the chamber-walls painted like a foliage of birds, wafting essence of spring flowers from an open casement. And then there is Sansa herself: the play of sun in her red hair, water blue eyes like the sea sapphires of White Harbor.

The people fight for a glimpse of their new Queen. What is one poor man\u2019s voice against so many? I wish you\u2019d see Ser Davos, now.\u201d He chuckles lightly, at the remembrance of his old and trusted companion running through the length of the courtyards, screaming orders to the stewards for the tables to be set, for the guests to be escorted to their seats, his face alarmingly red. \u201cHe looks like a hassled chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Brienne helping him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Brienne has more important things to do. Besides if Tormund keeps lurking around the stable-yards I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever set foot outside of this castle again.\u201d</p><p>Sansa almost giggles, then controls herself, and turns to her work. \u201cLook what I made,\u201d she says.</p><p>On the table, lies a pair of neatly folded fur cloaks. Bridal furs, hand-made. Sansa brushes her palm over the soft fabric. \u201cJeyne said she wanted to bring over the finest tailors from King\u2019s Landing to make us silk robes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refused?\u201d Jon asks lightly. \u201cYou\u2019d look splendid in silk, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refused.\u201d Sansa says quietly. \u201cThis may sound childlike, but I want us to wear something that would bring to mind our House, not the fancy Southron lords. We Starks, we don\u2019t prance about in satins and samite, ours is the old way, the way the North wants. We cannot afford to be lavish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Jon says thoughtfully. He comes closer, pulls Sansa to him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you\u2019re giving up on anything.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to be the grandest Queen in all of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s dimples show despite herself. \u201cAm I not, already?!-but I don\u2019t speak in jest, Jon. And you never saw my work. The tailors of King\u2019s Landing never had a Septa Mordane to show them the ways of the world!\u201d she shakes out the cloaks for her betrothed to see.</p><p>It\u2019s only wolf fur pelts on simple woolen cloaks, but Sansa\u2019s butterfly-delicate embroidery makes them look lovelier than anything any Westerosi King or Queen had ever donned. Hers is in the shades of cream-and-gold, and below the waist, russet birds fly in-and-out a wilderness of rich red roses. The direwolf of their house is stamped in gold on the back. Jon\u2019s is in black (<i>in keeping with tradition, I suppose</i>, he remarks to her amusement) and in silver threads Sansa has depicted the Targaryen dragon and the Stark direwolf against a backdrop of weirwoods. It\u2019s a clever mix of her House hues with his.</p><p>Not for the first time, Jon is struck by a wave of pride at the seemingly endless arsenal of talents his wife-to-be unleashes every other day. She is talented, she is kind. She makes people feel at ease. The Realm calls her Queen Sansa the Good. <i>And she is not even a queen yet</i>, Jon thinks. They will go insane at the coronation. <i>But first, the wedding</i>. Jon feels a warm blaze within him, one he has not felt for many a day for a long, long time. However when he looks at Sansa, he sees her downcast face, and he knows something is amiss.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u201cDo you remember the last time I made us matching furs? That was the day we faced Ramsay, when we vowed to fight for our home at the cost of our lives.\u201d</p><p>He remembers. How couldn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201c I\u2019ll miss Winterfell. King\u2019s Landing shall feel so strange.\u201d She looks up and he sees her eyes are welling. \u201cDo you know why I wanted to have our wedding in Winterfell? It\u2019s where it all began, Jon. I had <i>hated</i> it here. And now I cannot bear to say goodbye.\u201d A solitary tear falls upon the furs, which Sansa hastily brushes away.</p><p>\u201cThe Starks shall remain at Winterfell. Arya and Bran will be here to look after our home. And you\u2019ll not be alone in King\u2019s Landing like you\u2019d been before, love. I\u2019ll be at your side. You\u2019ll never be alone again.\u201d</p><p>She smiles through her tears. \u201cThis is why I made our wedding cloaks myself. I wanted to start my new life, but I am too cowardly to let go of my old one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no shame in holding onto your memories, Sansa.\u201d He knows this. He will miss Winterfell too. He\u2019ll miss the godswood and the gardens and the snow and the cold. This is the place they grew up in. This is the place they fought to reclaim. More importantly, this is where they found solace in each other, much after hope had bled out of their lives in every which way. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through so much. You\u2019ve waited for this all your life. You deserve to be Queen, more than anyone I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He stops. \u201cI\u2019ve met a few<i>,</i> I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201dshe smacks him on the elbow.

Seven hells.\u201d</p><p>Sansa and Jon chuckle, and then he takes her hand, gazing into her lovely eyes. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Get the furs and let\u2019s go put together your little fairytale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more comfort in familiarity than in fairytales, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jon only smiles. \u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16650694%2Fchapters%2F39184252&amp;t=N2VkMjNmYTQwODNkZjUzMzQ4ZDRkYTEwMzM0OTBlNmRhZjBmM2YxZCwxMGNlMzFkNzJhNWQ0NTM5MzBjMDE1YmVlY2FlYzIwNWM2Nzc5YmM4\">also on ao3</a></b></p><p><b>(the themes of the story were inspired partially by the works of <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSKl6U8Ojdvn9iT0F5Rz0Zg\">@jaylahve</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRP5sFx2owjKPvkSB4YbVpw\">@tiny-little-bird</a>)</b></p>",

This is a nostalgic fic based on the day of their wedding :)  </b></p><p>Mere hours before the ceremony begins, Jon finds Sansa in her old chambers, her head bent over her finished work, fawning like a proud mother of a newborn babe. He thinks of how endearing the picture is: early morning rays laving the room in a burnished glow, new d\u00e9cor on the chamber-walls painted like a foliage of birds, wafting essence of spring flowers from an open casement. And then there is Sansa herself: the play of sun in her red hair, water blue eyes like the sea sapphires of White Harbor. There is something poignant about the way she is seated-she looks like a saint. He decides to leave, to not destroy the fragile tranquility of the moment but as Jon turns, she looks up to see him.</p><p>\u201cIs it time yet?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d Jon kisses the crown of her head. \u201cAnd what about you? The people fight for a glimpse of their new Queen. What is one poor man\u2019s voice against so many? I wish you\u2019d see Ser Davos, now.\u201d He chuckles lightly, at the remembrance of his old and trusted companion running through the length of the courtyards, screaming orders to the stewards for the tables to be set, for the guests to be escorted to their seats, his face alarmingly red. \u201cHe looks like a hassled chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Brienne helping him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Brienne has more important things to do. Besides if Tormund keeps lurking around the stable-yards I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever set foot outside of this castle again.\u201d</p><p>Sansa almost giggles, then controls herself, and turns to her work. \u201cLook what I made,\u201d she says.</p><p>On the table, lies a pair of neatly folded fur cloaks. Bridal furs, hand-made. Sansa brushes her palm over the soft fabric. \u201cJeyne said she wanted to bring over the finest tailors from King\u2019s Landing to make us silk robes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refused?\u201d Jon asks lightly. \u201cYou\u2019d look splendid in silk, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refused.\u201d Sansa says quietly. \u201cThis may sound childlike, but I want us to wear something that would bring to mind our House, not the fancy Southron lords. We Starks, we don\u2019t prance about in satins and samite, ours is the old way, the way the North wants. We cannot afford to be lavish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Jon says thoughtfully. He comes closer, pulls Sansa to him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you\u2019re giving up on anything.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to be the grandest Queen in all of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s dimples show despite herself. \u201cAm I not, already?!-but I don\u2019t speak in jest, Jon. And you never saw my work. The tailors of King\u2019s Landing never had a Septa Mordane to show them the ways of the world!\u201d she shakes out the cloaks for her betrothed to see.</p><p>It\u2019s only wolf fur pelts on simple woolen cloaks, but Sansa\u2019s butterfly-delicate embroidery makes them look lovelier than anything any Westerosi King or Queen had ever donned. Hers is in the shades of cream-and-gold, and below the waist, russet birds fly in-and-out a wilderness of rich red roses. The direwolf of their house is stamped in gold on the back. Jon\u2019s is in black (<i>in keeping with tradition, I suppose</i>, he remarks to her amusement) and in silver threads Sansa has depicted the Targaryen dragon and the Stark direwolf against a backdrop of weirwoods. It\u2019s a clever mix of her House hues with his.</p><p>Not for the first time, Jon is struck by a wave of pride at the seemingly endless arsenal of talents his wife-to-be unleashes every other day. She is talented, she is kind. She makes people feel at ease. The Realm calls her Queen Sansa the Good. <i>And she is not even a queen yet</i>, Jon thinks. They will go insane at the coronation. <i>But first, the wedding</i>. Jon feels a warm blaze within him, one he has not felt for many a day for a long, long time. However when he looks at Sansa, he sees her downcast face, and he knows something is amiss.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u201cDo you remember the last time I made us matching furs? That was the day we faced Ramsay, when we vowed to fight for our home at the cost of our lives.\u201d</p><p>He remembers. How couldn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201c I\u2019ll miss Winterfell. King\u2019s Landing shall feel so strange.\u201d She looks up and he sees her eyes are welling. \u201cDo you know why I wanted to have our wedding in Winterfell? It\u2019s where it all began, Jon. I had <i>hated</i> it here. And now I cannot bear to say goodbye.\u201d A solitary tear falls upon the furs, which Sansa hastily brushes away.</p><p>\u201cThe Starks shall remain at Winterfell. Arya and Bran will be here to look after our home. And you\u2019ll not be alone in King\u2019s Landing like you\u2019d been before, love. I\u2019ll be at your side. You\u2019ll never be alone again.\u201d</p><p>She smiles through her tears. \u201cThis is why I made our wedding cloaks myself. I wanted to start my new life, but I am too cowardly to let go of my old one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no shame in holding onto your memories, Sansa.\u201d He knows this. He will miss Winterfell too. He\u2019ll miss the godswood and the gardens and the snow and the cold. This is the place they grew up in. This is the place they fought to reclaim. More importantly, this is where they found solace in each other, much after hope had bled out of their lives in every which way. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through so much. You\u2019ve waited for this all your life. You deserve to be Queen, more than anyone I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He stops. \u201cI\u2019ve met a few<i>,</i> I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201dshe smacks him on the elbow. He laughs, pulls her to an embrace. Outside, they hear Arya shout, \u201cAlright, you both in there, get down to the godswood and make it lawful before you start lovering again! Seven hells.\u201d</p><p>Sansa and Jon chuckle, and then he takes her hand, gazing into her lovely eyes. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Get the furs and let\u2019s go put together your little fairytale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more comfort in familiarity than in fairytales, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jon only smiles. \u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16650694%2Fchapters%2F39184252&amp;t=N2VkMjNmYTQwODNkZjUzMzQ4ZDRkYTEwMzM0OTBlNmRhZjBmM2YxZCwxMGNlMzFkNzJhNWQ0NTM5MzBjMDE1YmVlY2FlYzIwNWM2Nzc5YmM4\">also on ao3</a></b></p><p><b>(the themes of the story were inspired partially by the works of <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSKl6U8Ojdvn9iT0F5Rz0Zg\">@jaylahve</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRP5sFx2owjKPvkSB4YbVpw\">@tiny-little-bird</a>)</b></p></p>",
