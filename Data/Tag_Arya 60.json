I just wish it was more of a team effort between Arya and Bran. I always thought that the first scene in ep 1 with bran missing every shot and arya hitting the bullseye was foreshadowing something important. Especially since he had a few visions holding a bow and arrow, I always thought that it would come full circle but instead he just sat there.",
        "answer": "<p>Oh yeah same they definitely dropped the ball with Bran lol no doubt about that. I\u2019m really disappointed with his character because honestly I expected him to be the one to stop the Night King in the end and they really just didn\u2019t do anything with his character. My original theory for the Night Kings ending was that Jamie and Bran would tag team the NK. The episode definitely had its issues and plot holes, but I went into this season with very low expectations for everyone especially Arya and to see that episode was amazing. I just have to separate the books and the show because I think the books are going to focus more on fufilling the prophecies and giving Bran a bigger arc. The show obviously needed to wrap up the NK and Brans story quick so they went with this and if I don\u2019t think too hard about I\u2019m happy with the episode overall. </p>",

She\u2019s one of my favourite characters and she is a badass but she has had no connection to the White walkers and the Night King until this episode.\u00a0</b></p><p>But as an assassin, she benefits from staying in the shadows, and could have been used as a\u00a0secret weapon against Cersei. She is now a hero, of legendary status, having killed a mythological being.\u00a0</p><p>I am also personally disappointed that this death might mean that Arya doesn\u2019t have a hand in killing Cersei. Her wearing Jaime\u2019s face to murder Cersei, is one of my favourite theories, but it would surely be too\u00a0much for\u00a0her to kill the two main baddies, both in the final series.\u00a0<br/></p><p><b>There are\u00a0also people in the series that were more deserving to kill\u00a0the Night King.\u00a0Undoubtedly the three people who most deserved to kill the Night King were:</b></p><p><b>Jon Snow: </b>Having sworn an oath to the Night\u2019s Watch to protect Westeros from whatever lay beyond the Wall, having later become Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch, and made it his personal mission to warn others of the White Walkers, and fought them more than anyone on the show, and lost many friends \u00a0to his hoard. Yes, Jon is the most obvious character, who has already had many heroic moments and is already lauded by his men and his queen, but you have to admit he deserved the kill, considering how the Night King has shaped his life.</p><p><b>Bran Stark / The Three Eyed Raven: </b>Having been persecuted by the Night King since he was \u2018marked\u2019 by him when shared a vision with him. He was forced to separate from his brother Rickon when he had to travel north, and later lost his mentor the first Three Eyed Raven, Hodor and Jojen to his undead men. With his new status as the Three Eyed Raven, he has become the Night King\u2019s mortal enemy, which hasn\u2019t been fully explained, and doesn\u2019t look like we will get any answers now.</p><p>Bran could have potentially have killed the Night King a different way than the one that was expected (Dragon glass, fire or Valyrian steel). He could have connected with the Night King in a vision, similar to his experience with Hodor and found a way to defeat him. It would have also given the writers a chance to explain the Night King, a character we know little about and whose motives are unclear.\u00a0</p><p>I guess you can say that Bran did have a hand in killing the Night King, having given Arya the Valyrian steel dagger, that had been previously used in his attempted murder by orders of Littlefinger. He also was bait to lure the Night King. </p><p><b>Daenerys Targaryen:</b> For losing one of her beloved dragons Viserion to the Night King, as well as losing many of her army to his forces in the final battle. Dany is the least deserving out of the three, but she was an incredible asset to the fight and her defeat of the Night King would have gained her the love and support of the North, who would still rather Jon lead them.\u00a0</p><p><b>So why do I think Jaime should have been the one to kill the Night King?</b></p><p>Jaime was regarded as one of the best swordsmen in Westeros before he lost his good hand. He has since trained himself to be just as good, and is\u00a0one of the few characters with a Valyrian sword, capable of killing the Night King.\u00a0He has had a major character arc and transformation, and he fits a couple of the Azor Ahai prophecies.</p><p>He also is in need of some redemption. His slaying of the Night King, would have protected Bran from sure death, redeeming himself after\u00a0trying to kill him Series 1, Episode 1. It brings Bran\u2019s story full circle, and also explains why he did not speak against Jaime when he was presented to Daenerys.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys would have had to have forgiven him, and as Queen, awarded him in some way, maybe by taking him into her council or appointing him as a commander now that Jorah is no longer able to serve her and Greyworm\u2019s fate is still unknown.\u00a0The North would have been indebted to him, and hailed him a hero, and his status as\u00a0Kingslayer would have taken new meaning.\u00a0</p><p>I doubt Jaime would have wanted to leave Brienne\u2019s side but much like when he charged at Daenerys when she attacked his men with Drogon, he may have have wanted the chance to kill an enemy that threatened those he loved and his family, including Cersei if they failed to kill him in the North.\u00a0</p><p>If Brienne had felt the need to aid Sansa in the crypts, it would have given Jaime the chance to contemplate whether to follow her to help Tyrion, or check up on Bran, who he knows is in the Godswood with only Theon and a few Ironborn guarding him, having been part of the war meeting. I doubt he would have thought Theon capable of protecting Bran.</p><p>I also think Jaime stands a good chance of dying at the end, in the battle against Cersei. As the Night King\u2019s killer, he is now legendary and should die a hero\u2019s death at the end so that his full story can be written in The Book of Brothers and be the hero in tales told to the next generation.\u00a0I think Jaime deserves to be a hero, but ultimately doesn&rsquo;t deserve to survive the final battle for the Iron Throne, given his past allegiances and actions.\u00a0</p>",

She\u2019s one of my favourite characters and she is a badass but she has had no connection to the White walkers and the Night King until this episode.\u00a0</b></p><p>But as an assassin, she benefits from staying in the shadows, and could have been used as a\u00a0secret weapon against Cersei. She is now a hero, of legendary status, having killed a mythological being.\u00a0</p><p>I am also personally disappointed that this death might mean that Arya doesn\u2019t have a hand in killing Cersei. Her wearing Jaime\u2019s face to murder Cersei, is one of my favourite theories, but it would surely be too\u00a0much for\u00a0her to kill the two main baddies, both in the final series.\u00a0<br></p><p><b>There are\u00a0also people in the series that were more deserving to kill\u00a0the Night King.\u00a0Undoubtedly the three people who most deserved to kill the Night King were:</b></p><p><b>Jon Snow: </b>Having sworn an oath to the Night\u2019s Watch to protect Westeros from whatever lay beyond the Wall, having later become Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch, and made it his personal mission to warn others of the White Walkers, and fought them more than anyone on the show, and lost many friends \u00a0to his hoard. Yes, Jon is the most obvious character, who has already had many heroic moments and is already lauded by his men and his queen, but you have to admit he deserved the kill, considering how the Night King has shaped his life.</p><p><b>Bran Stark / The Three Eyed Raven: </b>Having been persecuted by the Night King since he was \u2018marked\u2019 by him when shared a vision with him. He was forced to separate from his brother Rickon when he had to travel north, and later lost his mentor the first Three Eyed Raven, Hodor and Jojen to his undead men. With his new status as the Three Eyed Raven, he has become the Night King\u2019s mortal enemy, which hasn\u2019t been fully explained, and doesn\u2019t look like we will get any answers now.</p><p>Bran could have potentially have killed the Night King a different way than the one that was expected (Dragon glass, fire or Valyrian steel). He could have connected with the Night King in a vision, similar to his experience with Hodor and found a way to defeat him. It would have also given the writers a chance to explain the Night King, a character we know little about and whose motives are unclear.\u00a0</p><p>I guess you can say that Bran did have a hand in killing the Night King, having given Arya the Valyrian steel dagger, that had been previously used in his attempted murder by orders of Littlefinger. He also was bait to lure the Night King. </p><p><b>Daenerys Targaryen:</b> For losing one of her beloved dragons Viserion to the Night King, as well as losing many of her army to his forces in the final battle. Dany is the least deserving out of the three, but she was an incredible asset to the fight and her defeat of the Night King would have gained her the love and support of the North, who would still rather Jon lead them.\u00a0</p><p><b>So why do I think Jaime should have been the one to kill the Night King?</b></p><p>Jaime was regarded as one of the best swordsmen in Westeros before he lost his good hand. He has since trained himself to be just as good, and is\u00a0one of the few characters with a Valyrian sword, capable of killing the Night King.\u00a0He has had a major character arc and transformation, and he fits a couple of the Azor Ahai prophecies.</p><p>He also is in need of some redemption. His slaying of the Night King, would have protected Bran from sure death, redeeming himself after\u00a0trying to kill him Series 1, Episode 1. It brings Bran\u2019s story full circle, and also explains why he did not speak against Jaime when he was presented to Daenerys.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys would have had to have forgiven him, and as Queen, awarded him in some way, maybe by taking him into her council or appointing him as a commander now that Jorah is no longer able to serve her and Greyworm\u2019s fate is still unknown.\u00a0The North would have been indebted to him, and hailed him a hero, and his status as\u00a0Kingslayer would have taken new meaning.\u00a0</p><p>I doubt Jaime would have wanted to leave Brienne\u2019s side but much like when he charged at Daenerys when she attacked his men with Drogon, he may have have wanted the chance to kill an enemy that threatened those he loved and his family, including Cersei if they failed to kill him in the North.\u00a0</p><p>If Brienne had felt the need to aid Sansa in the crypts, it would have given Jaime the chance to contemplate whether to follow her to help Tyrion, or check up on Bran, who he knows is in the Godswood with only Theon and a few Ironborn guarding him, having been part of the war meeting. I doubt he would have thought Theon capable of protecting Bran.</p><p>I also think Jaime stands a good chance of dying at the end, in the battle against Cersei. As the Night King\u2019s killer, he is now legendary and should die a hero\u2019s death at the end so that his full story can be written in The Book of Brothers and be the hero in tales told to the next generation.\u00a0I think Jaime deserves to be a hero, but ultimately doesn\u2019t deserve to survive the final battle for the Iron Throne, given his past allegiances and actions.\u00a0</p>",
