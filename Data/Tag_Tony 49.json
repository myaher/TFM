        "answer": "<p>(Alright, so, I don\u2019t actually remember getting this ask, so I don\u2019t have any kind of plan with it, but here\u2019s kind of how I see it. With Stephen/Tony, and they\u2019re not student/teacher anymore, because that\u2019s a power dynamic that takes me to a very bad place.)</p><p>How it starts:</p><p>\u201cYou know, Doc, for a Wizard, you aren\u2019t so bad. I might just have to visit Hogwarts again.\u201d </p><p>Stephen glared at Tony and Tony just smiled like it was normal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a master of the mystic arts. Stop calling me a wizard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do magic. You\u2019re a wizard. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. I\u2019m not waving a wand around saying one word to make things happen. Magic is a complex art. I\u2019ve basically got an unofficial doctorate in the Mystic Arts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re a doctor Wizard.\u201d Tony nodded, like it was the simplest thing in the world.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Stephen pushed Tony\u2019s astral form out of his body.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I did not consent to be magicked. I feel violated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever met a wizard who could do that?\u201d Stephen asked as he helped Tony back to his feet from where he\u2019d fallen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you.\u201d Tony grimaced as Stephen pulls him up by the left hand. </p><p>Stephen glared.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, point taken. That\u2019s not the Harry Potter mumble jumbo. Don\u2019t turn me into a ghost again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a ghost, you were on the astral plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was definitely dead. Not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were dead, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to return to your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god you\u2019re right. I must be Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Stephen groaned. He knew Tony was messing with him, but he couldn\u2019t stand the line Tony\u2019s conversation was taking. He just wanted to fix it.</p><p>\u201cIf you knew anything about magic you\u2019d know why everything you just said is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow \u201calright then. Teach me.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, Tony, you have to. Stop that! You have to concentrate on yourself. Stop looking at what everyone else is doing and trying to imitate them. It\u2019s not as simple as getting the motions right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. Since when does spinning your hand in a circle make a portal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try this again.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! Magic works!\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019ve been here for hours. You need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple more minutes. I\u2019ll finish this page and be out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my hair I\u2019m worried about. You\u2019re exhausting yourself.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from the tome he was studying and locked his gaze on Stephen\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an entire world of magic that I can\u2019t defend us against. Exhaustion is the least of my worries.\u201d</p><p>A portal appeares under Tony\u2019s book and it falls through, landing it Stephen\u2019s hand. \u201cGet some sleep, you can keep studying tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>When Tony goes to bed, Stephen checks on him in the astral plane to make sure he\u2019s actually sleeping. </p><p>He is.</p><p>That time.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m conbining this with the suit and you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe relic chose you. I\u2019m not going to fight you on that.\u201d</p><p>Tony almost didn\u2019t believe him, but Stephen keeps his word.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou can leave here, and go back out there, but if you do, I ask that you not use any magic that might easily be identified as magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, afraid I\u2019m going to expose your secret school for witchcraft and wizardry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a word, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Stephen stepped through a portal into Tony\u2019s living room while Tony watched the news, mostly just surprised that anyone had caught him.</p><p>\u201cI asked you for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would see me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have camera footage of you creating a portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t know magic existed!\u201d</p><p>Stephen glared.</p><p>Tony creates a portal and jumps through it to get away from Stephen.</p><p>Of course, Stephen follows him via his own portal, so that doesn\u2019t really work, but for a second Tony felt like he\u2019d escaped.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re calling me a technomage. I could get used to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you got caught doing magic, your job was to do less magic for the cameras, not more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange, Doc, Stephen, they already knew about magic. Why keep a secret if everyone knows it?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cOkay, that time it actually wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t you. Your magic isn\u2019t anywhere near strong enough for this kind of spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude. But fair. Who was it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave that to me. You\u2019re already in over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always in over my head. I also always make it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like sure!\u201d</p><p>Tony was using a combination of tech and magic to shoot and shield himself from a monster summoned from another dimension.</p><p>\u201cWell, I tried for as long as I could. That should count. Besides, I basically have an unofficial PhD in saving the world, so I think I can hold my own.\u201d</p><p>Just then the monster knocks Tony out of the sky and Stephen has to rush defeating the monster to get to him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cI told you not to be there because your magic is a liability. You needed shields that you don\u2019t have the skills to conjure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should\u2019ve taught me,\u201d Tony coughed from what was probably his death bed. \u201cGive it to me, straight, Fox, how long have I got.\u201d He was really feeling the bruising across his back and chest where he had slammed into the ground and a monster tail.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re going to be living a long life in the wake of your own stupidity. Consider yourself lucky.\u201d He\u2019d lost an apprentice in the battle.</p><p>\u201cEvery day.\u201d Tony coughed again, and clutched his ribs where they stung him.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone I should call for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhodey, he\u2019s my emergency contact. If I\u2019m not dying, though, it\u2019s probably better not to contact him.\u201d</p><p>Stephen sighed.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cStrange? I brought you a get well present.\u201d It was tech, of course, but tech made for Stephen, for his hands. </p><p>Stephen was the one laid up post battle, his injuries of magical origin, but relatively harmless with time. Creating and performing a counter spell would take longer than just waiting for it to wear off.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Stephen said as he tried to sit up.</p><p>Tony put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cNo, no, no. Wong said not to move. We trust Wong. We listen to Wong. Don\u2019t move.\u201d He handed Stephen the bagged (not wrapped) present and Stephen was surprised to find how light it was.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me like that, you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>Steve dumped out the contents of the bad and sifted through the tissue paper until he found a set of fingerless gloves made of material so lightweight that Stephen was astonished.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re like nothing.\u201d He said, slipping one on, only to be dazed by magical symbols slashing and then dying down again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my own design, like those copper things, but a thousand times better, and enhanced with magic so they\u2019ll basically never need to be replaced. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Tony started collecting the bag and tissue paper, leaving the other glove for Stephen to try on. He flexed his fingers, the pain in them significantly decreased and the shakiness barely visible. His hands were still weak, he could feel the lack of muscles in them as he clenched and unclenched his fist. He stared at them and then looked back up at Tony. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged, and started towards the door again. \u201cDon\u2019t say I never paid you back for the magic lessons doc.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cTony? Can you hear me? Where does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Tony gurgled, and that was a really bad sign. \u201cTony!\u201d Stephen yelled as the man passed out. Stephen, not knowing what else to do, laid down and pushed himself into the astral plane.</p><p><i>\u201cTook you long enough. It\u2019s been like, four second, Strange.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Tony,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cUh, trust me. I know. I took a blow to the back a couple weeks ago and cracked a rib, I think it broke when I hit the ground. If my extensive knowledge of injury is correct, I punctured a lung. Doc, if I choke to death on my own blood, I\u2019m gonna be really upset with you. Like, I might even haunt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, the nearest hospital-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing the gloves.\u201d Tony pointed out and Stephen looked down at them.</p><p>\u201cThe shaking isn\u2019t nearly-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYour hands are strong enough. The nano-tech in the suit can provide everything you need. Do it here. Do it now. I won\u2019t make it to a hospital, now without a portal.\u201d He gestured to the absent slingring on Stephen\u2019s fingers and Stephen cursed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI do know.\u201d Tony cut him off, \u201cif you don\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll definately die. Permanently. Come on, Stephen. I trust you. Trust yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cI kinda can\u2019t believe that worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who convinced me to do it.\u201d</p><p>Tony scoffed, now completely lucid and recovering in a hospital. \u201cYeah, but I mean, it was a Hail Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get an infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky, or just in very skilled hands?\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow at Stephen, who rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get injured-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, doc. If I told you about every injury I got your phone would ring four times a day. You got me. I\u2019m good. It was a one off.\u201d</p><p>Stephen sighed.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insufferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, back at you, doc! Were you going to tell anyone your plan was self-sacrifice, or were we just supposed to figure it out when you were dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you put a tracking device in my gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have never once activated, until you went completely fucking AWOL.

            "comment": "<p>(Alright, so, I don\u2019t actually remember getting this ask, so I don\u2019t have any kind of plan with it, but here\u2019s kind of how I see it. With Stephen/Tony, and they\u2019re not student/teacher anymore, because that\u2019s a power dynamic that takes me to a very bad place.)</p><p>How it starts:</p><p>\u201cYou know, Doc, for a Wizard, you aren\u2019t so bad. I might just have to visit Hogwarts again.\u201d </p><p>Stephen glared at Tony and Tony just smiled like it was normal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a master of the mystic arts. Stop calling me a wizard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do magic. You\u2019re a wizard. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. I\u2019m not waving a wand around saying one word to make things happen. Magic is a complex art. I\u2019ve basically got an unofficial doctorate in the Mystic Arts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re a doctor Wizard.\u201d Tony nodded, like it was the simplest thing in the world.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Stephen pushed Tony\u2019s astral form out of his body.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I did not consent to be magicked. I feel violated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever met a wizard who could do that?\u201d Stephen asked as he helped Tony back to his feet from where he\u2019d fallen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you.\u201d Tony grimaced as Stephen pulls him up by the left hand. </p><p>Stephen glared.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, point taken. That\u2019s not the Harry Potter mumble jumbo. Don\u2019t turn me into a ghost again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a ghost, you were on the astral plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was definitely dead. Not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were dead, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to return to your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god you\u2019re right. I must be Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Stephen groaned. He knew Tony was messing with him, but he couldn\u2019t stand the line Tony\u2019s conversation was taking. He just wanted to fix it.</p><p>\u201cIf you knew anything about magic you\u2019d know why everything you just said is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow \u201calright then. Teach me.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, Tony, you have to. Stop that! You have to concentrate on yourself. Stop looking at what everyone else is doing and trying to imitate them. It\u2019s not as simple as getting the motions right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. Since when does spinning your hand in a circle make a portal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try this again.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! Magic works!\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019ve been here for hours. You need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple more minutes. I\u2019ll finish this page and be out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my hair I\u2019m worried about. You\u2019re exhausting yourself.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from the tome he was studying and locked his gaze on Stephen\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an entire world of magic that I can\u2019t defend us against. Exhaustion is the least of my worries.\u201d</p><p>A portal appeares under Tony\u2019s book and it falls through, landing it Stephen\u2019s hand. \u201cGet some sleep, you can keep studying tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>When Tony goes to bed, Stephen checks on him in the astral plane to make sure he\u2019s actually sleeping. </p><p>He is.</p><p>That time.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m conbining this with the suit and you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe relic chose you. I\u2019m not going to fight you on that.\u201d</p><p>Tony almost didn\u2019t believe him, but Stephen keeps his word.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou can leave here, and go back out there, but if you do, I ask that you not use any magic that might easily be identified as magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, afraid I\u2019m going to expose your secret school for witchcraft and wizardry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a word, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Stephen stepped through a portal into Tony\u2019s living room while Tony watched the news, mostly just surprised that anyone had caught him.</p><p>\u201cI asked you for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would see me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have camera footage of you creating a portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t know magic existed!\u201d</p><p>Stephen glared.</p><p>Tony creates a portal and jumps through it to get away from Stephen.</p><p>Of course, Stephen follows him via his own portal, so that doesn\u2019t really work, but for a second Tony felt like he\u2019d escaped.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re calling me a technomage. I could get used to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you got caught doing magic, your job was to do less magic for the cameras, not more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange, Doc, Stephen, they already knew about magic. Why keep a secret if everyone knows it?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cOkay, that time it actually wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t you. Your magic isn\u2019t anywhere near strong enough for this kind of spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude. But fair. Who was it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave that to me. You\u2019re already in over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always in over my head. I also always make it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like sure!\u201d</p><p>Tony was using a combination of tech and magic to shoot and shield himself from a monster summoned from another dimension.</p><p>\u201cWell, I tried for as long as I could. That should count. Besides, I basically have an unofficial PhD in saving the world, so I think I can hold my own.\u201d</p><p>Just then the monster knocks Tony out of the sky and Stephen has to rush defeating the monster to get to him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cI told you not to be there because your magic is a liability. You needed shields that you don\u2019t have the skills to conjure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should\u2019ve taught me,\u201d Tony coughed from what was probably his death bed. \u201cGive it to me, straight, Fox, how long have I got.\u201d He was really feeling the bruising across his back and chest where he had slammed into the ground and a monster tail.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re going to be living a long life in the wake of your own stupidity. Consider yourself lucky.\u201d He\u2019d lost an apprentice in the battle.</p><p>\u201cEvery day.\u201d Tony coughed again, and clutched his ribs where they stung him.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone I should call for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhodey, he\u2019s my emergency contact. If I\u2019m not dying, though, it\u2019s probably better not to contact him.\u201d</p><p>Stephen sighed.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cStrange? I brought you a get well present.\u201d It was tech, of course, but tech made for Stephen, for his hands. </p><p>Stephen was the one laid up post battle, his injuries of magical origin, but relatively harmless with time. Creating and performing a counter spell would take longer than just waiting for it to wear off.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Stephen said as he tried to sit up.</p><p>Tony put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cNo, no, no. Wong said not to move. We trust Wong. We listen to Wong. Don\u2019t move.\u201d He handed Stephen the bagged (not wrapped) present and Stephen was surprised to find how light it was.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me like that, you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>Steve dumped out the contents of the bad and sifted through the tissue paper until he found a set of fingerless gloves made of material so lightweight that Stephen was astonished.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re like nothing.\u201d He said, slipping one on, only to be dazed by magical symbols slashing and then dying down again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my own design, like those copper things, but a thousand times better, and enhanced with magic so they\u2019ll basically never need to be replaced. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Tony started collecting the bag and tissue paper, leaving the other glove for Stephen to try on. He flexed his fingers, the pain in them significantly decreased and the shakiness barely visible. His hands were still weak, he could feel the lack of muscles in them as he clenched and unclenched his fist. He stared at them and then looked back up at Tony. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged, and started towards the door again. \u201cDon\u2019t say I never paid you back for the magic lessons doc.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cTony? Can you hear me? Where does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Tony gurgled, and that was a really bad sign. \u201cTony!\u201d Stephen yelled as the man passed out. Stephen, not knowing what else to do, laid down and pushed himself into the astral plane.</p><p><i>\u201cTook you long enough. It\u2019s been like, four second, Strange.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Tony,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cUh, trust me. I know. I took a blow to the back a couple weeks ago and cracked a rib, I think it broke when I hit the ground. If my extensive knowledge of injury is correct, I punctured a lung. Doc, if I choke to death on my own blood, I\u2019m gonna be really upset with you. Like, I might even haunt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, the nearest hospital-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing the gloves.\u201d Tony pointed out and Stephen looked down at them.</p><p>\u201cThe shaking isn\u2019t nearly-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYour hands are strong enough. The nano-tech in the suit can provide everything you need. Do it here. Do it now. I won\u2019t make it to a hospital, now without a portal.\u201d He gestured to the absent slingring on Stephen\u2019s fingers and Stephen cursed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI do know.\u201d Tony cut him off, \u201cif you don\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll definately die. Permanently. Come on, Stephen. I trust you. Trust yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cI kinda can\u2019t believe that worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who convinced me to do it.\u201d</p><p>Tony scoffed, now completely lucid and recovering in a hospital. \u201cYeah, but I mean, it was a Hail Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get an infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky, or just in very skilled hands?\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow at Stephen, who rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get injured-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, doc. If I told you about every injury I got your phone would ring four times a day. You got me. I\u2019m good. It was a one off.\u201d</p><p>Stephen sighed.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insufferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, back at you, doc! Were you going to tell anyone your plan was self-sacrifice, or were we just supposed to figure it out when you were dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you put a tracking device in my gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have never once activated, until you went completely fucking AWOL. What the hell, Stephen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou shut your fucking mouth.\u201d Tony glared, advancing on Stephen and encroaching on his space. \u201cWe just proved that it wasn\u2019t the only way.\u201d He stabbed a finger into Stephen\u2019s chest, anger glaring in his eyes. \u201cIf you would just share the burden, maybe this kind of shit wouldn\u2019t keep happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy-\u201c</p><p>\u201cStop making excuses!\u201d Tony yelled, pushing Stephen, knocking him a couple steps back into the wall of the Sanctum. \u201cStop acting like no one will miss you when one of your stupid plans to get yourself killed to save the universe finally works out! You don\u2019t get to do that! You don\u2019t get to kill yourself without saying anything!\u201d Stephen could see the tears welling up in Tony\u2019s eyes, angry and obtrusive. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to make these kinds of plans without telling anyone.\u201d</p><p>The unspoken \u201cwithout telling me\u201d hung like humidity in the air, stucky and thick and all encompassing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that.\u201d Tony whispered and then he created a portal, leaving without looking back at Stephen.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry. </i></p><p>The simple words were printed on a simple cards, accompanied by a simple bear.

I might just have to visit Hogwarts again.\u201d </p><p>Stephen glared at Tony and Tony just smiled like it was normal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a master of the mystic arts. Stop calling me a wizard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do magic. You\u2019re a wizard. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. I\u2019m not waving a wand around saying one word to make things happen. Magic is a complex art. I\u2019ve basically got an unofficial doctorate in the Mystic Arts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re a doctor Wizard.\u201d Tony nodded, like it was the simplest thing in the world.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Stephen pushed Tony\u2019s astral form out of his body.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I did not consent to be magicked. I feel violated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever met a wizard who could do that?\u201d Stephen asked as he helped Tony back to his feet from where he\u2019d fallen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you.\u201d Tony grimaced as Stephen pulls him up by the left hand. </p><p>Stephen glared.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, point taken. That\u2019s not the Harry Potter mumble jumbo. Don\u2019t turn me into a ghost again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a ghost, you were on the astral plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was definitely dead. Not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were dead, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to return to your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god you\u2019re right. I must be Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Stephen groaned. He knew Tony was messing with him, but he couldn\u2019t stand the line Tony\u2019s conversation was taking. He just wanted to fix it.</p><p>\u201cIf you knew anything about magic you\u2019d know why everything you just said is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow \u201calright then. Teach me.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, Tony, you have to. Stop that! You have to concentrate on yourself. Stop looking at what everyone else is doing and trying to imitate them. It\u2019s not as simple as getting the motions right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. Since when does spinning your hand in a circle make a portal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try this again.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! Magic works!\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019ve been here for hours. You need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple more minutes. I\u2019ll finish this page and be out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my hair I\u2019m worried about. You\u2019re exhausting yourself.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from the tome he was studying and locked his gaze on Stephen\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an entire world of magic that I can\u2019t defend us against. Exhaustion is the least of my worries.\u201d</p><p>A portal appeares under Tony\u2019s book and it falls through, landing it Stephen\u2019s hand. \u201cGet some sleep, you can keep studying tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>When Tony goes to bed, Stephen checks on him in the astral plane to make sure he\u2019s actually sleeping. </p><p>He is.</p><p>That time.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m conbining this with the suit and you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe relic chose you. I\u2019m not going to fight you on that.\u201d</p><p>Tony almost didn\u2019t believe him, but Stephen keeps his word.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou can leave here, and go back out there, but if you do, I ask that you not use any magic that might easily be identified as magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, afraid I\u2019m going to expose your secret school for witchcraft and wizardry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a word, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Stephen stepped through a portal into Tony\u2019s living room while Tony watched the news, mostly just surprised that anyone had caught him.</p><p>\u201cI asked you for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would see me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have camera footage of you creating a portal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t know magic existed!\u201d</p><p>Stephen glared.</p><p>Tony creates a portal and jumps through it to get away from Stephen.</p><p>Of course, Stephen follows him via his own portal, so that doesn\u2019t really work, but for a second Tony felt like he\u2019d escaped.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re calling me a technomage. I could get used to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you got caught doing magic, your job was to do less magic for the cameras, not more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange, Doc, Stephen, they already knew about magic. Why keep a secret if everyone knows it?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cOkay, that time it actually wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t you. Your magic isn\u2019t anywhere near strong enough for this kind of spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude. But fair. Who was it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave that to me. You\u2019re already in over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always in over my head. I also always make it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like sure!\u201d</p><p>Tony was using a combination of tech and magic to shoot and shield himself from a monster summoned from another dimension.</p><p>\u201cWell, I tried for as long as I could. That should count. Besides, I basically have an unofficial PhD in saving the world, so I think I can hold my own.\u201d</p><p>Just then the monster knocks Tony out of the sky and Stephen has to rush defeating the monster to get to him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cI told you not to be there because your magic is a liability. You needed shields that you don\u2019t have the skills to conjure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should\u2019ve taught me,\u201d Tony coughed from what was probably his death bed. \u201cGive it to me, straight, Fox, how long have I got.\u201d He was really feeling the bruising across his back and chest where he had slammed into the ground and a monster tail.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re going to be living a long life in the wake of your own stupidity. Consider yourself lucky.\u201d He\u2019d lost an apprentice in the battle.</p><p>\u201cEvery day.\u201d Tony coughed again, and clutched his ribs where they stung him.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone I should call for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhodey, he\u2019s my emergency contact. If I\u2019m not dying, though, it\u2019s probably better not to contact him.\u201d</p><p>Stephen sighed.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cStrange? I brought you a get well present.\u201d It was tech, of course, but tech made for Stephen, for his hands. </p><p>Stephen was the one laid up post battle, his injuries of magical origin, but relatively harmless with time. Creating and performing a counter spell would take longer than just waiting for it to wear off.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Stephen said as he tried to sit up.</p><p>Tony put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cNo, no, no. Wong said not to move. We trust Wong. We listen to Wong. Don\u2019t move.\u201d He handed Stephen the bagged (not wrapped) present and Stephen was surprised to find how light it was.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me like that, you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>Steve dumped out the contents of the bad and sifted through the tissue paper until he found a set of fingerless gloves made of material so lightweight that Stephen was astonished.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re like nothing.\u201d He said, slipping one on, only to be dazed by magical symbols slashing and then dying down again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my own design, like those copper things, but a thousand times better, and enhanced with magic so they\u2019ll basically never need to be replaced. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Tony started collecting the bag and tissue paper, leaving the other glove for Stephen to try on. He flexed his fingers, the pain in them significantly decreased and the shakiness barely visible. His hands were still weak, he could feel the lack of muscles in them as he clenched and unclenched his fist. He stared at them and then looked back up at Tony. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged, and started towards the door again. \u201cDon\u2019t say I never paid you back for the magic lessons doc.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cTony? Can you hear me? Where does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Tony gurgled, and that was a really bad sign. \u201cTony!\u201d Stephen yelled as the man passed out. Stephen, not knowing what else to do, laid down and pushed himself into the astral plane.</p><p><i>\u201cTook you long enough. It\u2019s been like, four second, Strange.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Tony,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cUh, trust me. I know. I took a blow to the back a couple weeks ago and cracked a rib, I think it broke when I hit the ground. If my extensive knowledge of injury is correct, I punctured a lung. Doc, if I choke to death on my own blood, I\u2019m gonna be really upset with you. Like, I might even haunt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, the nearest hospital-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing the gloves.\u201d Tony pointed out and Stephen looked down at them.</p><p>\u201cThe shaking isn\u2019t nearly-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYour hands are strong enough. The nano-tech in the suit can provide everything you need. Do it here. Do it now. I won\u2019t make it to a hospital, now without a portal.\u201d He gestured to the absent slingring on Stephen\u2019s fingers and Stephen cursed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI do know.\u201d Tony cut him off, \u201cif you don\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll definately die. Permanently. Come on, Stephen. I trust you. Trust yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cI kinda can\u2019t believe that worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who convinced me to do it.\u201d</p><p>Tony scoffed, now completely lucid and recovering in a hospital. \u201cYeah, but I mean, it was a Hail Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get an infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky, or just in very skilled hands?\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow at Stephen, who rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get injured-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, doc. If I told you about every injury I got your phone would ring four times a day. You got me. I\u2019m good. It was a one off.\u201d</p><p>Stephen sighed.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insufferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, back at you, doc! Were you going to tell anyone your plan was self-sacrifice, or were we just supposed to figure it out when you were dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you put a tracking device in my gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have never once activated, until you went completely fucking AWOL. What the hell, Stephen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou shut your fucking mouth.\u201d Tony glared, advancing on Stephen and encroaching on his space. \u201cWe just proved that it wasn\u2019t the only way.\u201d He stabbed a finger into Stephen\u2019s chest, anger glaring in his eyes. \u201cIf you would just share the burden, maybe this kind of shit wouldn\u2019t keep happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy-\u201c</p><p>\u201cStop making excuses!\u201d Tony yelled, pushing Stephen, knocking him a couple steps back into the wall of the Sanctum. \u201cStop acting like no one will miss you when one of your stupid plans to get yourself killed to save the universe finally works out! You don\u2019t get to do that! You don\u2019t get to kill yourself without saying anything!\u201d Stephen could see the tears welling up in Tony\u2019s eyes, angry and obtrusive. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to make these kinds of plans without telling anyone.\u201d</p><p>The unspoken \u201cwithout telling me\u201d hung like humidity in the air, stucky and thick and all encompassing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that.\u201d Tony whispered and then he created a portal, leaving without looking back at Stephen.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry. </i></p><p>The simple words were printed on a simple cards, accompanied by a simple bear. When Tony picked up the store bought brown monstrosity, it started to speak.</p><p>\u201cI never think about how my actions will affect individuals, only how they will affect the universe. I\u2019m sorry that what I did upset you. I hope you can forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Tony opened a portal and threw the best through it into Stephen\u2019s study. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>They met on the battlefield for the first time in months, and Tony was doing his best to ignore him. Stephen respected his wishes and ignored him in return.</p><p>Until a gold and red armor started falling out of the air.</p><p>Stephen made a portal, cutting his trip to the ground (and velocity) in fourths, keeping him from hitting the ground as hard as he could have. </p><p>He still made a rut in the street below him.</p><p>Stephen had to keep his focus on the battle. </p><p>Not long after, Iron Man was stumbling through the air, shields at the ready, and Stephen yelled at him. </p><p>\u201cIron Man, you\u2019re injured, stand down!\u201d</p><p>Tony ignored him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>When the battle was over, Stephen was fuming. He caught Tony before he could go, putting them both in the mirror dimension so they wouldn\u2019t be overheard.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on! Like you\u2019re one to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve been killed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve been killed? Pot? Meet Kettle,\u201d he said, pointing to Stephen and then himself. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t have died, so stop being dramatic. We won, I kicked the shit out of some aliens. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d He gestured to Stephen\u2019s sling ring.</p><p>Stephen glared. \u201cYou frustrate me to no end!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at ya!\u201d</p><p>They glared at each other too close to each other, before Tony wrenches Stephen towards him by the shirt collar and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cFucking wizard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot genius.\u201d</p><p>They kissed again, until Wong finally pulled them out of the mirro dimension, because people were starting to worry about them.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking, eggshell tux for me, maybe something warm grey for you. We could both do a warm blue then. I know you said no red, but I think if we got matching cloaks you could wear Levi, and that\u2019d be-\u201c</p><p>Stephen kisses Tony in the darkness of their bedroom to shut him the hell up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late at night for wedding planning, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Will post to AO3 eventually.</p>",

Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; He handed Stephen the bagged (not wrapped) present and Stephen was surprised to find how light it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t look at me like that, you&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve dumped out the contents of the bad and sifted through the tissue paper until he found a set of fingerless gloves made of material so lightweight that Stephen was astonished.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re like nothing.&rdquo; He said, slipping one on, only to be dazed by magical symbols slashing and then dying down again.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re my own design, like those copper things, but a thousand times better, and enhanced with magic so they&rsquo;ll basically never need to be replaced. You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony started collecting the bag and tissue paper, leaving the other glove for Stephen to try on. He flexed his fingers, the pain in them significantly decreased and the shakiness barely visible. His hands were still weak, he could feel the lack of muscles in them as he clenched and unclenched his fist. He stared at them and then looked back up at Tony. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shrugged, and started towards the door again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I never paid you back for the magic lessons doc.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony? Can you hear me? Where does it hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gurgled, and that was a really bad sign. &ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Stephen yelled as the man passed out. Stephen, not knowing what else to do, laid down and pushed himself into the astral plane.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Took you long enough. It&rsquo;s been like, four second, Strange.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t funny, Tony,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, trust me. I know. I took a blow to the back a couple weeks ago and cracked a rib, I think it broke when I hit the ground. If my extensive knowledge of injury is correct, I punctured a lung. Doc, if I choke to death on my own blood, I&rsquo;m gonna be really upset with you. Like, I might even haunt you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, the nearest hospital-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wearing the gloves.&rdquo; Tony pointed out and Stephen looked down at them.</p><p>&ldquo;The shaking isn&rsquo;t nearly-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your hands are strong enough. The nano-tech in the suit can provide everything you need. Do it here. Do it now. I won&rsquo;t make it to a hospital, now without a portal.&rdquo; He gestured to the absent slingring on Stephen&rsquo;s fingers and Stephen cursed.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do know.&rdquo; Tony cut him off, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t do it, I&rsquo;ll definately die. Permanently. Come on, Stephen. I trust you. Trust yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I kinda can&rsquo;t believe that worked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were the one who convinced me to do it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony scoffed, now completely lucid and recovering in a hospital. &ldquo;Yeah, but I mean, it was a Hail Mary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky you didn&rsquo;t get an infection.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky, or just in very skilled hands?&rdquo; Tony raised an eyebrow at Stephen, who rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;When you get injured-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start, doc. If I told you about every injury I got your phone would ring four times a day. You got me. I&rsquo;m good. It was a one off.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen sighed.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insufferable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, back at you, doc! Were you going to tell anyone your plan was self-sacrifice, or were we just supposed to figure it out when you were dead?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you put a tracking device in my gloves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I have never once activated, until you went completely fucking AWOL. What the hell, Stephen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was the only-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shut your fucking mouth.&rdquo; Tony glared, advancing on Stephen and encroaching on his space. &ldquo;We just proved that it wasn&rsquo;t the only way.&rdquo; He stabbed a finger into Stephen&rsquo;s chest, anger glaring in his eyes. &ldquo;If you would just share the burden, maybe this kind of shit wouldn&rsquo;t keep happening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that easy-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop making excuses!&rdquo; Tony yelled, pushing Stephen, knocking him a couple steps back into the wall of the Sanctum. &ldquo;Stop acting like no one will miss you when one of your stupid plans to get yourself killed to save the universe finally works out! You don&rsquo;t get to do that! You don&rsquo;t get to kill yourself without saying anything!&rdquo; Stephen could see the tears welling up in Tony&rsquo;s eyes, angry and obtrusive. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to make these kinds of plans without telling anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>The unspoken &ldquo;without telling me&rdquo; hung like humidity in the air, stucky and thick and all encompassing.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to do that.&rdquo; Tony whispered and then he created a portal, leaving without looking back at Stephen.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry. </i></p><p>The simple words were printed on a simple cards, accompanied by a simple bear. When Tony picked up the store bought brown monstrosity, it started to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I never think about how my actions will affect individuals, only how they will affect the universe. I&rsquo;m sorry that what I did upset you. I hope you can forgive me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony opened a portal and threw the best through it into Stephen&rsquo;s study. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>They met on the battlefield for the first time in months, and Tony was doing his best to ignore him. Stephen respected his wishes and ignored him in return.</p><p>Until a gold and red armor started falling out of the air.</p><p>Stephen made a portal, cutting his trip to the ground (and velocity) in fourths, keeping him from hitting the ground as hard as he could have. </p><p>He still made a rut in the street below him.</p><p>Stephen had to keep his focus on the battle. </p><p>Not long after, Iron Man was stumbling through the air, shields at the ready, and Stephen yelled at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Iron Man, you&rsquo;re injured, stand down!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony ignored him.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>When the battle was over, Stephen was fuming. He caught Tony before he could go, putting them both in the mirror dimension so they wouldn&rsquo;t be overheard.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell was that!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on! Like you&rsquo;re one to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve been killed!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve been killed? Pot? Meet Kettle,&rdquo; he said, pointing to Stephen and then himself. &ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t have died, so stop being dramatic. We won, I kicked the shit out of some aliens. Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo; He gestured to Stephen&rsquo;s sling ring.</p><p>Stephen glared. &ldquo;You frustrate me to no end!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Back at ya!&rdquo;</p><p>They glared at each other too close to each other, before Tony wrenches Stephen towards him by the shirt collar and kissed him.</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking wizard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Idiot genius.&rdquo;</p><p>They kissed again, until Wong finally pulled them out of the mirro dimension, because people were starting to worry about them.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking, eggshell tux for me, maybe something warm grey for you. We could both do a warm blue then. I know you said no red, but I think if we got matching cloaks you could wear Levi, and that&rsquo;d be-&ldquo;</p><p>Stephen kisses Tony in the darkness of their bedroom to shut him the hell up.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late at night for wedding planning, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Will post to AO3 eventually.</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Trigger warning: Bullying (not physical), brief mention of past loses, anxiety/anxious thoughts described.</b></p><p><b>In which Peter finds it rather difficult to sit alone in class while his classmates show off their perfectly normal parents in their perfectly normal family.</b></p><p>Career day has always been something he&rsquo;d dreaded.<br/>Not that he didn&rsquo;t love bringing May to school, show everyone once again just how kindhearted this woman was. He loved spending more time with her really.</p><p>But Flash his stares and quick insulting slurs got worse every year, and every year he managed to make it so that May had not the slightest idea that the kid was insulting him. <br/>And every year his parents would be brought up. And every year it hurt because yes, of course, this day was for a parental figure coming and showing what they did and why exactly their kid was in that school.</p><p>And sure, he didn&rsquo;t remember much about them. God, he had only been an infant when it happened. But it hurt none the less. And this year was going to be the worst one yet.</p><p>Because this was the first year that Ben wouldn&rsquo;t be there. <br/>And May had gotten a call the day before telling her one of her very good friends had gotten into an accident. And May wouldn&rsquo;t be May if she wouldn&rsquo;t have rushed to the hospital right away, stopping off to buy a small stuffed animal and to call Peter, telling him she wouldn&rsquo;t be back until Saturday.</p><p>And he understood. Really he did. He would&rsquo;ve done the same in a heartbeat, probably doing anything in his power to get there as fast as possible and only leave when he was absolutely certain they would be fine.</p><p>But that meant he would be alone for three days.</p><p>And Happy had told him to only call him if absolutely necessary because God he had called and texted him so much that the man had gone insane.</p><p>And Career day would be on Friday.</p><p>And Flash would be there to torment him with a smirk that would never leave his face, that made him have to remind himself once again about why he didn&rsquo;t just beat the boy senseless or whip out the mask to show him he was tormenting his hero.</p><p>But he&rsquo;d be fine.</p><p>Yup. <br/>Fine.</p><p>So he called over Ned to ask if he wanted to hang out the day before. <br/>His birthday had come around earlier that month and they still hadn&rsquo;t gotten to build the new lego avengers tower that he had found on his bed, simply screaming to be built. The shiny &lsquo;limited edition&rsquo; sticker on the box confirming his suspicion of who could&rsquo;ve bought probably extremely expensive present.</p><p>That is if the Ironman wrapping paper didn&rsquo;t give it away already.</p><p>Said paper was carefully removed and folded to use later for Neds birthday, his friend would freak out over the wrapping alone if he told him the guy who was printed onto the red paper had gifted it to him.</p><p>But Ned was busy with finishing the project they had been given after finishing the one that was due the next week way too early.</p><p>And MJ surely wouldn&rsquo;t want to hang out, calling him lame or something similar, her tone of voice telling him she was kidding.</p><p>So he ordered take-out. <br/>And sat on the couch waiting for the Chinese to arrive. <br/>And ended up walking on the ceiling because the couch was a boring place to sit and who wouldn&rsquo;t want to stick to the ceiling.</p><p>And he ate the food alone. Quickly putting on his suit and tending to his self-proclaimed duties far after the curfew May had held him to.</p><p>And he came home as the sky tinted pink and orange, scratched up more then he would&rsquo;ve needed to be if he had paid attention to what he was doing. The bruise on his jaw and the cut across his nose healing quickly but not quick enough for them to be gone as he put on his usual clothes and swung his backpack over his shoulder.</p><p>May wasn&rsquo;t there to worry so he didn&rsquo;t hide the green and purple coloured patch of skin with the foundation he had let MJ buy for him.</p><p>The lousy excuse he had used to convince her to buy the makeup hadn&rsquo;t worked and he knew that.

He loved spending more time with her really.</p><p>But Flash his stares and quick insulting slurs got worse every year, and every year he managed to make it so that May had not the slightest idea that the kid was insulting him. <br>And every year his parents would be brought up. And every year it hurt because yes, of course, this day was for a parental figure coming and showing what they did and why exactly their kid was in that school.</p><p>And sure, he didn\u2019t remember much about them. God, he had only been an infant when it happened. But it hurt none the less. And this year was going to be the worst one yet.</p><p>Because this was the first year that Ben wouldn\u2019t be there. <br>And May had gotten a call the day before telling her one of her very good friends had gotten into an accident. And May wouldn\u2019t be May if she wouldn\u2019t have rushed to the hospital right away, stopping off to buy a small stuffed animal and to call Peter, telling him she wouldn\u2019t be back until Saturday.</p><p>And he understood. Really he did. He would\u2019ve done the same in a heartbeat, probably doing anything in his power to get there as fast as possible and only leave when he was absolutely certain they would be fine.</p><p>But that meant he would be alone for three days.</p><p>And Happy had told him to only call him if absolutely necessary because God he had called and texted him so much that the man had gone insane.</p><p>And Career day would be on Friday.</p><p>And Flash would be there to torment him with a smirk that would never leave his face, that made him have to remind himself once again about why he didn\u2019t just beat the boy senseless or whip out the mask to show him he was tormenting his hero.</p><p>But he\u2019d be fine.</p><p>Yup. <br>Fine.</p><p>So he called over Ned to ask if he wanted to hang out the day before. <br>His birthday had come around earlier that month and they still hadn\u2019t gotten to build the new lego avengers tower that he had found on his bed, simply screaming to be built. The shiny \u2018limited edition\u2019 sticker on the box confirming his suspicion of who could\u2019ve bought probably extremely expensive present.</p><p>That is if the Ironman wrapping paper didn\u2019t give it away already.</p><p>Said paper was carefully removed and folded to use later for Neds birthday, his friend would freak out over the wrapping alone if he told him the guy who was printed onto the red paper had gifted it to him.</p><p>But Ned was busy with finishing the project they had been given after finishing the one that was due the next week way too early.</p><p>And MJ surely wouldn\u2019t want to hang out, calling him lame or something similar, her tone of voice telling him she was kidding.</p><p>So he ordered take-out. <br>And sat on the couch waiting for the Chinese to arrive. <br>And ended up walking on the ceiling because the couch was a boring place to sit and who wouldn\u2019t want to stick to the ceiling.</p><p>And he ate the food alone. Quickly putting on his suit and tending to his self-proclaimed duties far after the curfew May had held him to.</p><p>And he came home as the sky tinted pink and orange, scratched up more then he would\u2019ve needed to be if he had paid attention to what he was doing. The bruise on his jaw and the cut across his nose healing quickly but not quick enough for them to be gone as he put on his usual clothes and swung his backpack over his shoulder.</p><p>May wasn\u2019t there to worry so he didn\u2019t hide the green and purple coloured patch of skin with the foundation he had let MJ buy for him.</p><p>The lousy excuse he had used to convince her to buy the makeup hadn\u2019t worked and he knew that. But as long as she wouldn\u2019t tell him face to face that she knew about his other identity he was not going to admit that he was doing an awful job at hiding it.</p><p>And as the door closed, music blasting through his head buts matching his sour mood as he walked down the hallway, down the street, without May towards the school that was filling with kids and their parents.</p><p>God this was pathetic.</p><p>That thought was confirmed once again as the very first person he saw as soon as he set foot onto school grounds was that of Flash.</p><p>His mother had left to talk to a few of her own friends, giving the kid enough time to make Peters day even worse.</p><p>\u201cHey penis, I see that even your auntie doesn\u2019t want to be seen with you anymore?

He loved spending more time with her really.</p><p>But Flash his stares and quick insulting slurs got worse every year, and every year he managed to make it so that May had not the slightest idea that the kid was insulting him. <br>And every year his parents would be brought up. And every year it hurt because yes, of course, this day was for a parental figure coming and showing what they did and why exactly their kid was in that school.</p><p>And sure, he didn\u2019t remember much about them. God, he had only been an infant when it happened. But it hurt none the less. And this year was going to be the worst one yet.</p><p>Because this was the first year that Ben wouldn\u2019t be there. <br>And May had gotten a call the day before telling her one of her very good friends had gotten into an accident. And May wouldn\u2019t be May if she wouldn\u2019t have rushed to the hospital right away, stopping off to buy a small stuffed animal and to call Peter, telling him she wouldn\u2019t be back until Saturday.</p><p>And he understood. Really he did. He would\u2019ve done the same in a heartbeat, probably doing anything in his power to get there as fast as possible and only leave when he was absolutely certain they would be fine.</p><p>But that meant he would be alone for three days.</p><p>And Happy had told him to only call him if absolutely necessary because God he had called and texted him so much that the man had gone insane.</p><p>And Career day would be on Friday.</p><p>And Flash would be there to torment him with a smirk that would never leave his face, that made him have to remind himself once again about why he didn\u2019t just beat the boy senseless or whip out the mask to show him he was tormenting his hero.</p><p>But he\u2019d be fine.</p><p>Yup. <br>Fine.</p><p>So he called over Ned to ask if he wanted to hang out the day before. <br>His birthday had come around earlier that month and they still hadn\u2019t gotten to build the new lego avengers tower that he had found on his bed, simply screaming to be built. The shiny \u2018limited edition\u2019 sticker on the box confirming his suspicion of who could\u2019ve bought probably extremely expensive present.</p><p>That is if the Ironman wrapping paper didn\u2019t give it away already.</p><p>Said paper was carefully removed and folded to use later for Neds birthday, his friend would freak out over the wrapping alone if he told him the guy who was printed onto the red paper had gifted it to him.</p><p>But Ned was busy with finishing the project they had been given after finishing the one that was due the next week way too early.</p><p>And MJ surely wouldn\u2019t want to hang out, calling him lame or something similar, her tone of voice telling him she was kidding.</p><p>So he ordered take-out. <br>And sat on the couch waiting for the Chinese to arrive. <br>And ended up walking on the ceiling because the couch was a boring place to sit and who wouldn\u2019t want to stick to the ceiling.</p><p>And he ate the food alone. Quickly putting on his suit and tending to his self-proclaimed duties far after the curfew May had held him to.</p><p>And he came home as the sky tinted pink and orange, scratched up more then he would\u2019ve needed to be if he had paid attention to what he was doing. The bruise on his jaw and the cut across his nose healing quickly but not quick enough for them to be gone as he put on his usual clothes and swung his backpack over his shoulder.</p><p>May wasn\u2019t there to worry so he didn\u2019t hide the green and purple coloured patch of skin with the foundation he had let MJ buy for him.</p><p>The lousy excuse he had used to convince her to buy the makeup hadn\u2019t worked and he knew that. But as long as she wouldn\u2019t tell him face to face that she knew about his other identity he was not going to admit that he was doing an awful job at hiding it.</p><p>And as the door closed, music blasting through his head buts matching his sour mood as he walked down the hallway, down the street, without May towards the school that was filling with kids and their parents.</p><p>God this was pathetic.</p><p>That thought was confirmed once again as the very first person he saw as soon as he set foot onto school grounds was that of Flash.</p><p>His mother had left to talk to a few of her own friends, giving the kid enough time to make Peters day even worse.</p><p>\u201cHey penis, I see that even your auntie doesn\u2019t want to be seen with you anymore? Couldn\u2019t your best buddy spiderman come with you? Or maybe Stark? Or is he to busy not knowing that you exist to be present?\u201d</p><p>The insults were lame and frankly not very creative. He\u2019d heard first graders come up with more cutting insults as the kid in front of him.</p><p>But he was already in a bad mood.<br>And Flash somehow managed to strike a nerve every single time he tried to pester him with these kinds of things.</p><p>Thought he could manage.</p><p>As long as Flash didn\u2019t go any further.<br>As long as he didn\u2019t cross the line Peter had set for him then he\u2019d be fine.</p><p>\u201cOh maybe your uncle could finally come back from the dead and that 'business trip\u2019 you said he was on and actually be useful.\u201d</p><p>And there goes said line.</p><p>The whole school knew about Ben. Of course, they did. When a kid breaks down in the middle of class and the teacher lets them leave, stating that 'It\u2019s alright. Dealing with such loss is always difficult Parker. It\u2019ll get easier with time\u2019 and Flash was present, the whole school knew by the time Peter sat back in his chair again.</p><p>He\u2019d always avoided the topic though. Even he had boundaries.</p><p>Though apparently not anymore.</p><p>So Peter ducks his head, fists clenched in his pockets as he walked through the big doors, carefully opening them, avoiding the handles as to not rip the complete door out of its hinges like he knew he would if he\u2019d allow his anger to get to him.</p><p>Not that class would be much better.</p><p>Because the class was basically cancelled. Every kid got their turn to introduce their parent who would then tell about their profession while the children either looked bored out of their minds or genuinely interested.</p><p>Peter just sat in the very back of the class next to an empty chair. <br>Ned had called in sick after his mother had forced him to do so.</p><p>His friend never got sick. And if he did he went to school because he either couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t want to miss classes.</p><p>But puking your guts out and demanding to go to school after had apparently been a bit too extreme for his mother.</p><p>Besides, the kids sat next to their parents so they wouldn\u2019t have been seated together either way.</p><p>He really didn\u2019t mind listening to the parents. He found most of their professions interesting. Whether that being the profession itself or that it explained why their kid was able to go to that school.</p><p>Just the interactions between parent and child were annoying.</p><p>The simple things like an embarrassing groan from the kid if their parent made a joke or the small side hug they were given when introduced.<br>Or how a mother constantly tried to fix her child\u2019s hair, the boy in question trying to duck from underneath his mother\u2019s fingers every time she touched his head.</p><p>Very simple things.<br>And they shouldn\u2019t mean a lot to Peter.<br>But the reminder that such bonds existed. Such simple things showed they trusted each other through and through.</p><p>That they could fight and yell that they hated each other as much as they wanted and eat dinner and laugh with them only hours after.</p><p>It reminded him too much of Ben.<br>Of the parents, he never knew.<br>Of May who was now sitting next to her friends\u2019 hospital bed, feeling so much worse than Peter and having every reason to do so.</p><p>But that made him feel worse in return.<br>Because feeling bad about feeling bad was, as May had told him, 'a normal teenage thing\u2019.<br>But he wasn\u2019t a normal teenager and frankly the feeling was annoying.</p><p>Flash had walked towards the front of the class, his mother following him and standing to his left as the kid started to speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with my mom. She works at an animal shelter in a parttime job and-\u201d he made eye contact with Peter. \u201c-works as a doctor in the army. My dad-\u201d a smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth, eyes never leaving Peters as said kid wanted to sink into the ground and get away from this godawful day more than ever. - couldn\u2019t make it because he was called into the hospital to perform a surgery that could determine a man\u2019s life. \u201c</p><p>\u201d thank you Flash, we only needed information about your mother but thank you for giving us more information. Now, miss Thompson will you please step forward and-\u201c</p><p>The teacher\u2019s monologue - Peter was sure she had practised it because it had been the same with every parent that was introduced- was interrupted by a loud knock on the classroom door, quickly followed by the said door swinging open in possibly the most dramatic way a classroom door could be swung open.</p><p>\"Ah, sorry I\u2019m late I had some business to attend to you know the drill\u2026 Oh hey, kid!\u201d</p><p>The man stepped into the classroom. Everything on him screamed expensive, the suit hugging his body in all the right places, obviously designed specifically for the man wearing it. The purple tie matching the light tinted purple shades balancing on the bridge of his nose.</p><p>The whole room suddenly seemed too small, everything that seemed even slightly classy or expensive in a 100-mile ratio now tacky as the man strutted towards the back of the classroom, aiming for the seat next to Peter before he was stopped by the teacher who seemed to snap out of her starstruck state.</p><p>\u201cSir I- \u2019m sure you\u2019re aware but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the right facility this is-\u201d</p><p>\u201cA high-school. Yes, I\u2019m aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you-I- it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you but-\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Pleasures all mine. I\u2019ll give you an autograph later if you want. Now, why don\u2019t mister wide mouth and his mother continue while I wait for my turn alright?\u201d</p><p>Flash was indeed gaping. Which was quite hilarious considering the whole class was starstruck as well. And he would\u2019ve laughed wouldn\u2019t it be for the fact that Peter himself sat frozen in place as the man took place next to him, leaning back and patting his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey, underoos how\u2019s May?</p><p>\"H-hey Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid you alright? I thought we were over this 'oh my god it\u2019s my idol faze\u2019 come on talk to me you look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- yeah was over it. It\u2019s just that you\u2013this- I\u2019m supposed to bring a parental figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. And May wasn\u2019t available so you\u2019re stuck with me, bud.\u201d</p><p>Peter was about to answer, what he didn\u2019t know really, the situation was just too absurd, as a rather annoying voice cut through their conversation.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark sir excuse me but you know Penis Parker?\u201d</p><p>Flash realised his mistake too late as Tony stood from his chair so quickly the plastic thing clattered onto the floor, two taps on his chest and a metallic glove with a glowing and softly humming repulsor formed around his hand. The noise indicated that the thing was preparing to fire, Peter, realised, as the man spoke to the kid in front of him in a dangerously calm tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-sir I didn\u2019t mean to I-\u201d</p><p>\u201crepeat yourself. What. Did. You. Call. Him.\u201d</p><p>His voice was barely above a whisper now, Flash frozen in place despite the obvious fear written all over his face, his mom and really everyone else in the room had thrown themselves under and behind the tables after the metal hand had formed.</p><p>\u201cI called him Penis Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. Now I am going to explain this slowly so your dipshit brain can process the information.<br>Don\u2019t say that again. In fact, don\u2019t talk to the kid again. If I see you or hear about you do even as much as looking at him you\u2019ll be able to witness just how strong this thing is first hand.\u201d</p><p>With that he lowered his hand, the metal disappearing with tiny, almost unnoticeable clicking noises as he turned around, grabbing the chair off of the ground and sitting down, one arm swung over Peters\u2019 shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou alright kid?\u201d <br>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine Mr Stark.\u201d. <br>\u201cCall me Tony. We talked about this. Now, why don\u2019t little shit and his mom continue with their talk show hm? Come on people I\u2019m not that scary the thing wouldn\u2019t even have blown his head off.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, the other people in the room got up again, all wide-eyed and a few shades paler than when Tony had first entered the room.</p><p>And after another minute or so Flash\u2019s mother was talking again. Voice now quite as she glanced at Tony who only looked at the kid next to him. cracking a few jokes or making comments about the kid that stood in front of the class.</p><p>And all Peter could do was smile and secretly wipe away a few tears of happiness.</p><p>And he practically skipped towards the front of the class when the teacher called his name, Tony Stark walking behind him, hand on his back in a comforting manner that felt so familiar it was almost painful.</p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Peter Parker and this-\u201d <br>\u201cKid I don\u2019t need an introduction. They all know who I am. Just sit back and let me talk a bit alright bud?\u201d</p><p>The last sentence was added with a small pat on the shoulder and a smile. A real one.</p><p>Peter had noticed how those had become more common over the last few months that he knew the man.</p><p>So he sat back, smiling stretching over his entire face as the man talked.</p><p>And when the day was done they walked through the school towards his multi-million dollar car, the kids and parental figures parting like the red sea to let them through. <br>Mr Starks hand remaining on his back.</p><p>And when they got to the car, Happy complaining about having to wait so long with all these kids taking pictures of the car, he still smiled.</p><p>And he only realises that he was crying as two hands settled onto his shoulders and Tony asked him if he was alright, brows frowned in worry.</p><p>And he nodded, smile still present, tears only increasing in numbers as he was urged into a hug because yes they now were 'there\u2019.</p><p>And the smile and tears didn\u2019t leave until he had closed the door behind his back, a short wave, accompanied by another one of those rare real smiles guiding him into the door.</p><p>Because only now did he realise that he didn\u2019t have to be jealous of the kids who sat with their fathers in the classroom. About the simple yet incredibly important gestures of pure trust that seemed so normal to them.</p><p>Because yes, Tony Stark had come in for career day. And yes he was supposed to bring a parental figure.</p><p>And yes, the man felt like a father to him. And God did he hope the feeling was mutual.</p><p>And as May returned he hugged her like he hadn\u2019t seen her in years. And they ate takeout as she talked about her friend and he told her about school.</p><p>And that watched a movie, Peter\u2019s head resting on May\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>And only now did he realise that he had a normal family. <br>A mother and father, not together but each perfect in their own way.</p><p>A normal family.</p><p>As normal as could be for Peter Benjamin Parker.</p>",

I&rsquo;ll give you an autograph later if you want. Now, why don&rsquo;t mister wide mouth and his mother continue while I wait for my turn alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Flash was indeed gaping. Which was quite hilarious considering the whole class was starstruck as well. And he would&rsquo;ve laughed wouldn&rsquo;t it be for the fact that Peter himself sat frozen in place as the man took place next to him, leaning back and patting his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, underoos how&rsquo;s May?</p><p>\"H-hey Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid you alright? I thought we were over this 'oh my god it&rsquo;s my idol faze&rsquo; come on talk to me you look like you&rsquo;ve seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- yeah was over it. It&rsquo;s just that you&ndash;this- I&rsquo;m supposed to bring a parental figure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup. And May wasn&rsquo;t available so you&rsquo;re stuck with me, bud.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was about to answer, what he didn&rsquo;t know really, the situation was just too absurd, as a rather annoying voice cut through their conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark sir excuse me but you know Penis Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>Flash realised his mistake too late as Tony stood from his chair so quickly the plastic thing clattered onto the floor, two taps on his chest and a metallic glove with a glowing and softly humming repulsor formed around his hand. The noise indicated that the thing was preparing to fire, Peter, realised, as the man spoke to the kid in front of him in a dangerously calm tone.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you call him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-sir I didn&rsquo;t mean to I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;repeat yourself. What. Did. You. Call. Him.&rdquo;</p><p>His voice was barely above a whisper now, Flash frozen in place despite the obvious fear written all over his face, his mom and really everyone else in the room had thrown themselves under and behind the tables after the metal hand had formed.</p><p>&ldquo;I called him Penis Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. Now I am going to explain this slowly so your dipshit brain can process the information.<br />Don&rsquo;t say that again. In fact, don&rsquo;t talk to the kid again. If I see you or hear about you do even as much as looking at him you&rsquo;ll be able to witness just how strong this thing is first hand.&rdquo;</p><p>With that he lowered his hand, the metal disappearing with tiny, almost unnoticeable clicking noises as he turned around, grabbing the chair off of the ground and sitting down, one arm swung over Peters&rsquo; shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright kid?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine Mr Stark.&rdquo;. <br />&ldquo;Call me Tony. We talked about this. Now, why don&rsquo;t little shit and his mom continue with their talk show hm? Come on people I&rsquo;m not that scary the thing wouldn&rsquo;t even have blown his head off.&rdquo;</p><p>Reluctantly, the other people in the room got up again, all wide-eyed and a few shades paler than when Tony had first entered the room.</p><p>And after another minute or so Flash&rsquo;s mother was talking again. Voice now quite as she glanced at Tony who only looked at the kid next to him. cracking a few jokes or making comments about the kid that stood in front of the class.</p><p>And all Peter could do was smile and secretly wipe away a few tears of happiness.</p><p>And he practically skipped towards the front of the class when the teacher called his name, Tony Stark walking behind him, hand on his back in a comforting manner that felt so familiar it was almost painful.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;m Peter Parker and this-&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Kid I don&rsquo;t need an introduction. They all know who I am. Just sit back and let me talk a bit alright bud?&rdquo;</p><p>The last sentence was added with a small pat on the shoulder and a smile. A real one.</p><p>Peter had noticed how those had become more common over the last few months that he knew the man.</p><p>So he sat back, smiling stretching over his entire face as the man talked.</p><p>And when the day was done they walked through the school towards his multi-million dollar car, the kids and parental figures parting like the red sea to let them through. <br />Mr Starks hand remaining on his back.</p><p>And when they got to the car, Happy complaining about having to wait so long with all these kids taking pictures of the car, he still smiled.</p><p>And he only realises that he was crying as two hands settled onto his shoulders and Tony asked him if he was alright, brows frowned in worry.</p><p>And he nodded, smile still present, tears only increasing in numbers as he was urged into a hug because yes they now were 'there&rsquo;.</p><p>And the smile and tears didn&rsquo;t leave until he had closed the door behind his back, a short wave, accompanied by another one of those rare real smiles guiding him into the door.</p><p>Because only now did he realise that he didn&rsquo;t have to be jealous of the kids who sat with their fathers in the classroom. About the simple yet incredibly important gestures of pure trust that seemed so normal to them.</p><p>Because yes, Tony Stark had come in for career day. And yes he was supposed to bring a parental figure.</p><p>And yes, the man felt like a father to him. And God did he hope the feeling was mutual.</p><p>And as May returned he hugged her like he hadn&rsquo;t seen her in years. And they ate takeout as she talked about her friend and he told her about school.</p><p>And that watched a movie, Peter&rsquo;s head resting on May&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>And only now did he realise that he had a normal family. <br />A mother and father, not together but each perfect in their own way.</p><p>A normal family.</p><p>As normal as could be for Peter Benjamin Parker.</p>",
