Nothing made y/n feel more ethereal than being wrapped in silk and satin Whether it be satin pajamas or silk sheets she lived in silk and satin everything. Y/N had lived quite a privileged life so far and she couldn\u2019t help but release a happy sigh at the thought of how lucky and fortunate she was to live the lavish life she did. Usually people who were well off spent their money and time traveling and partying on boats, and yes Y/N had her fair share of yacht parties and travels but she had already seen most of what she wanted to see. At least materialistically. Y/N always wondered about things left unseen and the small crevices in the universe that held the sweetest secrets. She didn\u2019t necessarily care for the seven wonders of the world, she was looking for her own seven wonders. She wanted to live in the times before her and experience the art and the culture and the magic that was. To put it short and sweet, Y/N dreamed of being a walking renaissance painting. </p><p>So instead of boat parties and beach houses, Y/N threw castle parties of her greatest fantasies. Each party was always themed after a great period in history. She had parties themed of different aspects of the renaissance and of the enlightenment periods. She had parties of the middle ages, and parties of times of Roman empires. Sometimes the themes repeated but she couldn\u2019t care, she loved the exhilarating feeling she got from traveling back in time even if it was brief. Her next party however, was something she\u2019d never done before. She knew Greek themed parties were a thing, but she didn\u2019t want your basic toga party with leaf crowns no, Y/N wanted to see Mount Olympus brought to life. For once she wanted to be the goddess marble statues were made of. She wanted to be the inspiration for the pieces of art that would be passed down and appreciated through centuries. And sure, maybe it wasn\u2019t real and it was only a fantasy, but that was where Y/N lived her happiest most self-loving self. </p><p>So there lay Y/N wrapped in a glorious gown made of lace and chiffon. A long slim off the shoulder champagne colored chiffon base with lace detailing at the hem and waistline that moved up towards the bust. Multi sized crystals embellished into the neckline and trickled down towards the waist. The same pattern following down the quarter length sleeves. At the hem the embellishments sized smaller to larger the lower you went. Y/N didn\u2019t believe in much, but she did believe that somewhere out there Aphrodite stared down with jealousy at her appearance. If she didn\u2019t know any better, it was a tough battle in looks between the two. </p><p>Apollo didn\u2019t like to spend too much time meddling in mortal affairs. He\u2019d seen what that did to most of his relatives and he figured he\u2019d save himself the trouble. However today he\u2019d happen to be tying up some loose strings for his sister -which didn\u2019t happen often but even Artemis found herself caught in some trouble sometimes as well- when he heard rave about a huge Olympian party. This at first confused him because he hadn\u2019t received word of any party from any relatives. Then he wondered how in the world the mortals knew what the Gods had planned for the evening. And that was when it hit him, no Olympian was throwing a party, it was just another measly mortal affair. At first mortal culture used to offend him, the togas and the leaves and in a sense, the appropriation of it all. He found it a little insulting that they reduced their power and glory. But he came to realize humans were pesky in all other ways not just this one. For the most part Apollo stayed clear. But something about this particular event was drawing him in. Perhaps the promise of bringing Olympus to life seemed intriguing. He figured while he was down here he could go for a laugh and entertainment. So Apollo made his way towards the castle everyone was raving on about. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s party was in full swing. Her vision had come to life in a damn near perfect way. From the tall white marble pillars to the golden flecks of light here and there, to even the lightly glimmering table cloth sashes. The food looks delicious displayed on golden platters and wine distributed through golden chalices. She was living an absolute dream and all the guests could not help but marvel at the sight of her. Some people even bold enough to call her Aphrodite. She knew she was no Aphrodite, she was ethereal on her own standards not another\u2019s. </p><p>Apollo\u2019s head was spinning. He kept hearing Aphrodite\u2019s name being called out but she was nowhere to be found. He looked around trying to see if he\u2019d spot any of his relatives but was coming up empty. These people are sure to feel Aphrodite\u2019s wrath if they\u2019re carelessly throwing out her name the way they are. He thought. His eyes wandered left and right trying to see if he\u2019d see this creature they\u2019d honored with the Goddess of Beauty\u2019s name. Finally after hearing the name be called out again, his eyes landed on the lucky woman. Suddenly he understood the comparison. This woman was one of the most alluring mortals he\u2019d ever seen. Her chocolate brown tresses of hair bounced with every laugh and head turn. Her smile shined brighter than any he\u2019d seen before. There was a particular gleam in her eyes that promised mischief and wonder and excitement all at once. Carefully observing her he\u2019d imagine the rage of envy Aphrodite was sure to feel if she ever crossed her path, and for this mortal woman\u2019s sake he hoped that never happened. That promise her eyes held pulled him close. So as soon as he spots her removing herself from the crowd and headed out towards the garden, he makes his way after her.</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t handle all this attention. The party wasn\u2019t about her, it was about bringing an experience to life. Nobody wanted to talk to her about her appreciation of the ancient Greek culture that created the vision for this night. And if she heard a single person call her Aphrodite one more time she was sure to snap. She makes her way out towards the garden away from the crowd drunk on the fairly expensive wine. I guess her dream of a real life Greek party had come to life. Half of the people in there were already drunk beyond reason dancing around half naked. She didn\u2019t expect to be followed out so she nearly jumps out of her skin when she hears a low voice behind her. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if Aphrodite were here I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have turned you into a beast by now\u201d the voice chuckled. </p><p>She spins around ready to respond with a smart remark when her voice catches in her throat at the sight of the man behind her. Chocolate curls adorning a beautifully chiseled face and arms that could crush skulls if they wanted to. Perfectly pink lips turned upwards in a smirk directed at her. There was a sparkle to his body that she could not put a finger to but knew was more than spray body glitter. She takes a moment to collect her thoughts before she blurts out something embarrassing about his glowing green eyes. </p><p>\u201cI guess I should consider myself lucky she isn\u2019t here\u201d she laughs a little breathlessly. He mimics her giggle and moves forward. </p><p>\u201cMay I take a seat? Wouldn\u2019t want a beautiful woman out here all on her own\u201d he says gesturing towards the space on the bench she\u2019s sat on. She tilts her head pondering whether she should trust this gorgeous stranger. Banking on the universe blessing her luck she moves the bit of her dress taking up the space. </p><p>\u201cGo ahead\u201d she mumbles watching as he moves forward again to take the seat. \u201cI\u201dm Y/N, what\u2019s your name?\u201d she extends a hand towards him. </p><p>He pauses for a second staring at the hand in front of her wondering what name to give this beautiful strange girl. </p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Harry\u201d he smiles taking her hand and lifting it up to his mouth to press a kiss. He sees a blush creep up her neck and tint her cheeks pink. He smirks once again. </p><p>\u201cWell Harry, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the wine or the lights but you are dazzling\u201d she blurts out eyes widening not believing the words that came out of her mouth. </p><p><br/></p><p><i>woooooooo I kept my word that I would post it by Sunday !

For once she wanted to be the goddess marble statues were made of. She wanted to be the inspiration for the pieces of art that would be passed down and appreciated through centuries. And sure, maybe it wasn\u2019t real and it was only a fantasy, but that was where Y/N lived her happiest most self-loving self. </p><p>So there lay Y/N wrapped in a glorious gown made of lace and chiffon. A long slim off the shoulder champagne colored chiffon base with lace detailing at the hem and waistline that moved up towards the bust. Multi sized crystals embellished into the neckline and trickled down towards the waist. The same pattern following down the quarter length sleeves. At the hem the embellishments sized smaller to larger the lower you went. Y/N didn\u2019t believe in much, but she did believe that somewhere out there Aphrodite stared down with jealousy at her appearance. If she didn\u2019t know any better, it was a tough battle in looks between the two. </p><p>Apollo didn\u2019t like to spend too much time meddling in mortal affairs. He\u2019d seen what that did to most of his relatives and he figured he\u2019d save himself the trouble. However today he\u2019d happen to be tying up some loose strings for his sister -which didn\u2019t happen often but even Artemis found herself caught in some trouble sometimes as well- when he heard rave about a huge Olympian party. This at first confused him because he hadn\u2019t received word of any party from any relatives. Then he wondered how in the world the mortals knew what the Gods had planned for the evening. And that was when it hit him, no Olympian was throwing a party, it was just another measly mortal affair. At first mortal culture used to offend him, the togas and the leaves and in a sense, the appropriation of it all. He found it a little insulting that they reduced their power and glory. But he came to realize humans were pesky in all other ways not just this one. For the most part Apollo stayed clear. But something about this particular event was drawing him in. Perhaps the promise of bringing Olympus to life seemed intriguing. He figured while he was down here he could go for a laugh and entertainment. So Apollo made his way towards the castle everyone was raving on about. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s party was in full swing. Her vision had come to life in a damn near perfect way. From the tall white marble pillars to the golden flecks of light here and there, to even the lightly glimmering table cloth sashes. The food looks delicious displayed on golden platters and wine distributed through golden chalices. She was living an absolute dream and all the guests could not help but marvel at the sight of her. Some people even bold enough to call her Aphrodite. She knew she was no Aphrodite, she was ethereal on her own standards not another\u2019s. </p><p>Apollo\u2019s head was spinning. He kept hearing Aphrodite\u2019s name being called out but she was nowhere to be found. He looked around trying to see if he\u2019d spot any of his relatives but was coming up empty. These people are sure to feel Aphrodite\u2019s wrath if they\u2019re carelessly throwing out her name the way they are. He thought. His eyes wandered left and right trying to see if he\u2019d see this creature they\u2019d honored with the Goddess of Beauty\u2019s name. Finally after hearing the name be called out again, his eyes landed on the lucky woman. Suddenly he understood the comparison. This woman was one of the most alluring mortals he\u2019d ever seen. Her chocolate brown tresses of hair bounced with every laugh and head turn. Her smile shined brighter than any he\u2019d seen before. There was a particular gleam in her eyes that promised mischief and wonder and excitement all at once. Carefully observing her he\u2019d imagine the rage of envy Aphrodite was sure to feel if she ever crossed her path, and for this mortal woman\u2019s sake he hoped that never happened. That promise her eyes held pulled him close. So as soon as he spots her removing herself from the crowd and headed out towards the garden, he makes his way after her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t handle all this attention. The party wasn\u2019t about her, it was about bringing an experience to life. Nobody wanted to talk to her about her appreciation of the ancient Greek culture that created the vision for this night. And if she heard a single person call her Aphrodite one more time she was sure to snap. She makes her way out towards the garden away from the crowd drunk on the fairly expensive wine. I guess her dream of a real life Greek party had come to life. Half of the people in there were already drunk beyond reason dancing around half naked. She didn\u2019t expect to be followed out so she nearly jumps out of her skin when she hears a low voice behind her. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if Aphrodite were here I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have turned you into a beast by now\u201d the voice chuckled. </p><p>She spins around ready to respond with a smart remark when her voice catches in her throat at the sight of the man behind her. Chocolate curls adorning a beautifully chiseled face and arms that could crush skulls if they wanted to. Perfectly pink lips turned upwards in a smirk directed at her. There was a sparkle to his body that she could not put a finger to but knew was more than spray body glitter. She takes a moment to collect her thoughts before she blurts out something embarrassing about his glowing green eyes. </p><p>\u201cI guess I should consider myself lucky she isn\u2019t here\u201d she laughs a little breathlessly. He mimics her giggle and moves forward. </p><p>\u201cMay I take a seat? Wouldn\u2019t want a beautiful woman out here all on her own\u201d he says gesturing towards the space on the bench she\u2019s sat on. She tilts her head pondering whether she should trust this gorgeous stranger. Banking on the universe blessing her luck she moves the bit of her dress taking up the space. </p><p>\u201cGo ahead\u201d she mumbles watching as he moves forward again to take the seat. \u201cI\u201dm Y/N, what\u2019s your name?\u201d she extends a hand towards him. </p><p>He pauses for a second staring at the hand in front of her wondering what name to give this beautiful strange girl. </p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Harry\u201d he smiles taking her hand and lifting it up to his mouth to press a kiss. He sees a blush creep up her neck and tint her cheeks pink. He smirks once again. </p><p>\u201cWell Harry, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the wine or the lights but you are dazzling\u201d she blurts out eyes widening not believing the words that came out of her mouth. </p><p><br></p><p><i>woooooooo I kept my word that I would post it by Sunday !

Nothing made y/n feel more ethereal than being wrapped in silk and satin Whether it be satin pajamas or silk sheets she lived in silk and satin everything. Y/N had lived quite a privileged life so far and she couldn\u2019t help but release a happy sigh at the thought of how lucky and fortunate she was to live the lavish life she did. Usually people who were well off spent their money and time traveling and partying on boats, and yes Y/N had her fair share of yacht parties and travels but she had already seen most of what she wanted to see. At least materialistically. Y/N always wondered about things left unseen and the small crevices in the universe that held the sweetest secrets. She didn\u2019t necessarily care for the seven wonders of the world, she was looking for her own seven wonders. She wanted to live in the times before her and experience the art and the culture and the magic that was. To put it short and sweet, Y/N dreamed of being a walking renaissance painting. </p><p>So instead of boat parties and beach houses, Y/N threw castle parties of her greatest fantasies. Each party was always themed after a great period in history. She had parties themed of different aspects of the renaissance and of the enlightenment periods. She had parties of the middle ages, and parties of times of Roman empires. Sometimes the themes repeated but she couldn\u2019t care, she loved the exhilarating feeling she got from traveling back in time even if it was brief.
