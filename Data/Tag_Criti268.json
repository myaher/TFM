        "question": "I think scanlan would take the chalice, to save his mom and vax. He already tried for the eye, someone would have to fight him for the chalice too.",
        "answer": "<p>I KNEW I FORGOT SOMEONE(S)!!!! Sorry Scanlan and Tarry \ud83d\ude2d </p><p>I have to say that I partially disagree with you about Scanlan though. He&rsquo;s already seen what his impulses and actions can do, and while he&rsquo;s certainly not the wisest, he&rsquo;s gotten wiser. (I&rsquo;m talking about him at the end of the campaign btw). Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think he would take the chalice for his mother because he is, quite literally Ioun&rsquo;s champion after the whole Vecna business goes down. He knows that his mother&rsquo;s story has already been recorded, and that it will be an everlasting song. And it&rsquo;ll be a mournful, bittersweet one, but she will be remembered and loved by him forever. </p><p>So yes, he would be tempted with rewriting time to save his mother (as would Vex and Vax with their mother if Vax hadn&rsquo;t died and wasn&rsquo;t the more immediate wound for Vex). But I&rsquo;m almost tempted to say that he would actually be offered to go back in time to save Vax in that final battle, not his mother. His mother&rsquo;s death due to goblins was awful. But him not being able to excute his plan to save Vax, or rather, having to give up saving Vax in favor of saving the world, is going to be something that wracks his sleep for ages. (I&rsquo;m sure he wakes up crying some nights, and Pike and Grog both are there to help shoulder some of the pain). </p><p>So the chalice would offer him to change the Vecna battle as a whole, and be able to save his wish spell to keep Vax, one of his closest friends, with them. A chance to save a close friend and save the world, ideally with fewer casualties. That would be a hard temptation to resist. </p><p>And honestly, going to that point in time makes it easy to diverge, so preventing a time paradox would be easy, since not a ton of time has passed since the event (assuming the chalice approaches him after the final battle, but before the M9 exist). Also, he wouldn&rsquo;t have the pain of all his friends forgeting most of their adventures and found family state. I think whether or not he takes the chalice will depend heavily on how the grieving process has weighed on him in the following years.</p><p>As for Tary, he&rsquo;s a rich boy alchemist/tinkerer/i forget his actual class. If anything, he&rsquo;d go the gilderoy lockheart route with a book detailing his adventures to find the chalice, and then his heroic denial and destruction of the device (some versions of the book will detail his denial of the chalice, and then interviews the has with the chalice instead of destroying it, but those books are limited edition and hard to find). The truth of the books sounds dubious at best, as is the Tarry way.</p>",
