I haven\u2019t written in a few years so I\u2019m a bit nervous about posting this. I can\u2019t <i>wait</i> to see what you think of this! Feel free to leave any type of feedback, it will be appreciated no matter what! </b></h1><p><b>Synopsis : Harry and Louis have been together for a year. Louis has depression and Harry has become more of a caretaker than a boyfriend, but no matter what Harry is there and would do anything for Louis. Louis will seclude himself and on his worst days he\u2019ll end up in a yelling match with Harry, which always make him feel even more shitty. </b></p><p><i><b>Word Count: 1386</b></i></p><p><b><i>Warnings : Mention of mental illness + suicide. </i></b></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Harry felt his breath hitch as he held his phone to his ear. His throat seemed impossibly dry and could almost feel his heart thumping out of his chest. \u201cI\u2019m coming home. Stay with him.\u201d He couldn\u2019t finish the sentence before he started crying. The tears wouldn\u2019t stop as he runs down the hall of the tattoo shop he worked at and grabs his jacket. The shop still had clients in it, so it\u2019s not like Harry to just leave during a busy part of their day.Mitch grabbed Harry\u2019s wrist before Harry could open the door to leave, \u201cHarry, what the fuck is going on? You can\u2019t leave right now!\u201d He says and Harry wipes his face with his sleeves, shaking his head as he looked his best friend in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s Louis.. he needs me.\u201d Harry speaks, not giving time for Mitch to respond before pushing the door open and walking out.  All he wanted to do was go home. Once he\u2019s in his car Harry pulls out of the parking lot, his fingers gripping the steering wheel so tight that his fingers were almost white. Usually Harry\u2019s an excellent driver, but his boyfriend was in trouble and he just wasn\u2019t concerned with the few honks he\u2019s getting as he runs through stop signs and has to look down at his speedometer several times to make sure he wouldn\u2019t get pulled over. It seems like he\u2019s caught every red light and they all seemed to last for an eternity. It felt like he couldn\u2019t get home fast enough. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>As he turned onto the street he lived on he saw the blue and red lights of the police car, Stan\u2019s small vehicle parked in the street, and the ambulance lights flickering. Stan watches as Harry parks his car and runs over to the car. Tears were still coming, wiping his tears with his sleeve as Harry gets out of the car. \u201cHarry, oh my God. I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d He says, watching as his best friends boyfriend walks right past him. Harry walks up his driveway, but he doesn\u2019t get far before an officer stands in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. You can\u2019t come inside.\u201d He says and Harry furrows his eyebrows, \u201cNo, that\u2019s my boyfriend in that house. I need to see him!\u201d He replies, attempting to push pass the officer until he feels the officer push him back. \u201cYou cannot be in the house. We will update you as we find things out.\u201d The officer says and Harry feels his heart sink to his stomach. How dare that officer tell him not to go see  his boyfriend in his own house. He just wanted to hold Louis and let him know how much he loved him. Stan walks over to Harry and breathes out loudly, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Harry says in a whispered tone after a moment of silence. \u201cLouis started sending me these messages about how much he loved me and how he always thought of me as a brother. He told me to tell you that he loves you so much and that you mean more to him than anyone else. I didn\u2019t know what it meant, so after several messages I ran over here and found him face down in the bathtub.\u201d Stan says, watching Harry\u2019s eyes get more and more watery as he told the story. \u201cI\u2019m the worst fucking boyfriend in the history.\u201d Harry whispers and Stan shakes his head. He would have responded, but as he started a gurney was pushed through the door. Harry puts his hand over his mouth as tears begin to roll down his cheeks again. He could see the dainty boy on the stretcher and just lost it. \u201cMy baby!\u201d He screamed and ran over to the gurney. All he was able to see was the familiar brown hair Louis sported before he was pushed out of the way. The EMT\u2019s were continuing to give him CPR as they put him in the back of the ambulance. As they shut the back doors Stan walks over to Harry, \u201cOne of the EMT\u2019s said that if you\u2019d like to ride with them you can ride in the front since they\u2019ll be working on Louis.\u201d He says and Harry nods. \u201cThank you so much. For everything.\u201d Harry says and hugs Stan tightly before running to the front of  the truck, getting inside and buckling himself up. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The drive just seemed perpetual. It\u2019s like the the driver couldn\u2019t go fast enough. What if Louis dies on the way down there? The morbid thoughts wouldn\u2019t stop and the more they came the more he panicked. These thoughts keep Harry distracted until they reach the hospital. Once the driver stops they get Louis out and wheel him in the hospital. \u201cGo to the waiting room and once we have Mr. Tomlinson set up we will come out and let you know.\u201d One of the nurses says and Harry watches them all rush Louis back. Harry goes to the waiting room and sits down. He looks around and sighs sadly. Today had been rough and this wasn\u2019t the way he wanted it to end. The longer he had to wait the more he began to worry. For a long time he just sat with his legs crossed, twiddling his thumbs. He didn\u2019t want to move just in case a doctor came out for him. At the same time he didn\u2019t want to just sit there and worry, so after an hour he gets up and goes to the restroom. After using the bathroom he gets a water from the vending machine and sits back down. Harry continued to wait for another hour and a half, almost falling asleep at one point. When he sees a doctor come in Harry perks up and sits up as he comes and sits next to him. \u201cHello, are you here for Mr. Tomlinson?\u201d He asks and Harry nods, \u201cHow is he? Is he okay? Is he alive?\u201d Harry asks with obvious panic in his voice. \u201cHe is alive, Mr. Styles. We\u2019re giving him some oxygen through a nasal tube just until he wakes up to make sure he\u2019s alright. He\u2019s still asleep and you can visit him whenever you want.\u201d The doctor finishes and Harry smiles, tears in his eyes as he sits up. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Harry walks down the hallway quickly and stands in front of the door that the doctor told him Louis would be in. He pushes down on the doorknob and pushes the door open. The curly haired man walks to the bed and just examines the lad that he loves so dearly. He has two little nubs in his nose, the tube wrapped around the back of his ears and it was connected to the vital signs monitor. Louis has an IV in the back of his hand. \u201cOh, Lou.\u201d Harry whispers and scoots a chair to sit beside him. \u201cI love you so fucking much, babe.\u201d He says and grabs Louis hand, kissing his knuckles softly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t be there for you. I feel like I\u2019ve failed you.\u201d Harry says and sniffles softly, chuckling softly as he feels the tears perk up in his eyes again. \u201cIf you were awake right now I know you\u2019d be calling me a pussy.\u201d Harry says and blinks the tears away. Even in Louis\u2019 lowest moments they could always manage to make each other laugh. Never in a million years did Harry think he\u2019d be in such a committed relationship, but he really thinks Louis is the love of his life. For a while he sat in silence as he held on to Louis\u2019 hand for dear life, leaning his forehead against Louis\u2019 knuckles. Just a few minutes had gone by when Harry felt a squeeze on his hand. He sits up looks at Louis. \u201cLou?\u201d He whispers and gentle rubs his thumb against the back of Louis\u2019 slightly smaller one. \u201cLouis, if you can hear me squeeze my hand.\u201d He prompts and just moments later he feels squeeze. \u201cBaby..\u201d He whispers and Harry stands up to walk to the other side of the bed, running his fingers through the feathery brown hair until he hears a voice. \u201cHi.\u201d Louis whispers and looks up at Harry. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>End Of Part 1</b></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Thank you SOO much for taking the time to read this story.

Even in Louis\u2019 lowest moments they could always manage to make each other laugh. Never in a million years did Harry think he\u2019d be in such a committed relationship, but he really thinks Louis is the love of his life. For a while he sat in silence as he held on to Louis\u2019 hand for dear life, leaning his forehead against Louis\u2019 knuckles. Just a few minutes had gone by when Harry felt a squeeze on his hand. He sits up looks at Louis. \u201cLou?\u201d He whispers and gentle rubs his thumb against the back of Louis\u2019 slightly smaller one. \u201cLouis, if you can hear me squeeze my hand.\u201d He prompts and just moments later he feels squeeze. \u201cBaby..\u201d He whispers and Harry stands up to walk to the other side of the bed, running his fingers through the feathery brown hair until he hears a voice. \u201cHi.\u201d Louis whispers and looks up at Harry. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>End Of Part 1</b></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Thank you SOO much for taking the time to read this story.

Feel free to leave any type of feedback, it will be appreciated no matter what! </b></h1><p><b>Synopsis : Harry and Louis have been together for a year. Louis has depression and Harry has become more of a caretaker than a boyfriend, but no matter what Harry is there and would do anything for Louis. Louis will seclude himself and on his worst days he\u2019ll end up in a yelling match with Harry, which always make him feel even more shitty. </b></p><p><i><b>Word Count: 1386</b></i></p><p><b><i>Warnings : Mention of mental illness + suicide. </i></b></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Harry felt his breath hitch as he held his phone to his ear. His throat seemed impossibly dry and could almost feel his heart thumping out of his chest. \u201cI\u2019m coming home. Stay with him.\u201d He couldn\u2019t finish the sentence before he started crying. The tears wouldn\u2019t stop as he runs down the hall of the tattoo shop he worked at and grabs his jacket. The shop still had clients in it, so it\u2019s not like Harry to just leave during a busy part of their day.Mitch grabbed Harry\u2019s wrist before Harry could open the door to leave, \u201cHarry, what the fuck is going on? You can\u2019t leave right now!\u201d He says and Harry wipes his face with his sleeves, shaking his head as he looked his best friend in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s Louis.. he needs me.\u201d Harry speaks, not giving time for Mitch to respond before pushing the door open and walking out.  All he wanted to do was go home. Once he\u2019s in his car Harry pulls out of the parking lot, his fingers gripping the steering wheel so tight that his fingers were almost white. Usually Harry\u2019s an excellent driver, but his boyfriend was in trouble and he just wasn\u2019t concerned with the few honks he\u2019s getting as he runs through stop signs and has to look down at his speedometer several times to make sure he wouldn\u2019t get pulled over. It seems like he\u2019s caught every red light and they all seemed to last for an eternity. It felt like he couldn\u2019t get home fast enough. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>As he turned onto the street he lived on he saw the blue and red lights of the police car, Stan\u2019s small vehicle parked in the street, and the ambulance lights flickering. Stan watches as Harry parks his car and runs over to the car. Tears were still coming, wiping his tears with his sleeve as Harry gets out of the car. \u201cHarry, oh my God. I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d He says, watching as his best friends boyfriend walks right past him. Harry walks up his driveway, but he doesn\u2019t get far before an officer stands in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. You can\u2019t come inside.\u201d He says and Harry furrows his eyebrows, \u201cNo, that\u2019s my boyfriend in that house. I need to see him!\u201d He replies, attempting to push pass the officer until he feels the officer push him back. \u201cYou cannot be in the house. We will update you as we find things out.\u201d The officer says and Harry feels his heart sink to his stomach. How dare that officer tell him not to go see  his boyfriend in his own house. He just wanted to hold Louis and let him know how much he loved him. Stan walks over to Harry and breathes out loudly, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Harry says in a whispered tone after a moment of silence. \u201cLouis started sending me these messages about how much he loved me and how he always thought of me as a brother. He told me to tell you that he loves you so much and that you mean more to him than anyone else. I didn\u2019t know what it meant, so after several messages I ran over here and found him face down in the bathtub.\u201d Stan says, watching Harry\u2019s eyes get more and more watery as he told the story. \u201cI\u2019m the worst fucking boyfriend in the history.\u201d Harry whispers and Stan shakes his head. He would have responded, but as he started a gurney was pushed through the door. Harry puts his hand over his mouth as tears begin to roll down his cheeks again. He could see the dainty boy on the stretcher and just lost it. \u201cMy baby!\u201d He screamed and ran over to the gurney. All he was able to see was the familiar brown hair Louis sported before he was pushed out of the way. The EMT\u2019s were continuing to give him CPR as they put him in the back of the ambulance. As they shut the back doors Stan walks over to Harry, \u201cOne of the EMT\u2019s said that if you\u2019d like to ride with them you can ride in the front since they\u2019ll be working on Louis.\u201d He says and Harry nods. \u201cThank you so much. For everything.\u201d Harry says and hugs Stan tightly before running to the front of  the truck, getting inside and buckling himself up. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The drive just seemed perpetual. It\u2019s like the the driver couldn\u2019t go fast enough. What if Louis dies on the way down there? The morbid thoughts wouldn\u2019t stop and the more they came the more he panicked. These thoughts keep Harry distracted until they reach the hospital. Once the driver stops they get Louis out and wheel him in the hospital. \u201cGo to the waiting room and once we have Mr. Tomlinson set up we will come out and let you know.\u201d One of the nurses says and Harry watches them all rush Louis back. Harry goes to the waiting room and sits down. He looks around and sighs sadly. Today had been rough and this wasn\u2019t the way he wanted it to end. The longer he had to wait the more he began to worry. For a long time he just sat with his legs crossed, twiddling his thumbs. He didn\u2019t want to move just in case a doctor came out for him. At the same time he didn\u2019t want to just sit there and worry, so after an hour he gets up and goes to the restroom. After using the bathroom he gets a water from the vending machine and sits back down. Harry continued to wait for another hour and a half, almost falling asleep at one point. When he sees a doctor come in Harry perks up and sits up as he comes and sits next to him. \u201cHello, are you here for Mr. Tomlinson?\u201d He asks and Harry nods, \u201cHow is he? Is he okay? Is he alive?\u201d Harry asks with obvious panic in his voice. \u201cHe is alive, Mr. Styles. We\u2019re giving him some oxygen through a nasal tube just until he wakes up to make sure he\u2019s alright. He\u2019s still asleep and you can visit him whenever you want.\u201d The doctor finishes and Harry smiles, tears in his eyes as he sits up. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Harry walks down the hallway quickly and stands in front of the door that the doctor told him Louis would be in. He pushes down on the doorknob and pushes the door open. The curly haired man walks to the bed and just examines the lad that he loves so dearly. He has two little nubs in his nose, the tube wrapped around the back of his ears and it was connected to the vital signs monitor. Louis has an IV in the back of his hand. \u201cOh, Lou.\u201d Harry whispers and scoots a chair to sit beside him. \u201cI love you so fucking much, babe.\u201d He says and grabs Louis hand, kissing his knuckles softly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t be there for you.
