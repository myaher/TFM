But that\u2019s a thin veneer over a very different kind of story.</p><p>First of all, there are <i>only</i> three characters of note with US army background. (We\u2019re not counting SHIELD.) All three of them are women and while <i>they</i> are presented in a positive light, their experience within the army <i>isn\u2019t</i>, really. We see both Maria and Carol face and talk about prejudice and misogyny in the army. It\u2019s made explicit. On top of that, we\u2019re faced with the army\u2019s habit of covering things up and how that negatively affects people. Not exactly a very flattering image of the US army, is it - regardless of whether it\u2019s actually the 90s or not. \n\n<br/></p><p>In addition, all three of the army characters are actually <i>dissociated</i> from the US army one way or the other. Maria no longer seems to be working there (though we don\u2019t get confirmation or explanation) and her attitude towards the Air Force can\u2019t exactly be called endorsing; she deals out some criticism there. Carol on the other hand barely remembers the army and what she does remember is either negatively tinted - read: prejudice towards her - or deals with her personal relationships with the two other women. She also does not care at all about any authority the army might (try to) claim to have. <br/></p><p>And then we have Lawson - who could fill the role of the good army authority, except it turns out she\u2019s an alien who\u2019s basically just been using the US army\u2019s resources to develope her own technology. And not even weaponry! No, her explicit goal is to \u201cstop the war\u201d - not by landing a decisive hit but by helping people <i>escape</i> the war. She denounces war - <i>the</i> war - outloud, which pretty clearly separates her from her army association.<br/></p><p>And that brings us to the actual plot of this movie. <br/></p><p>Namely, the big glaring antimilitaristic message that\u2019s underlying damn near everything. <br/></p><p>The whole Kree-Skrull plot is basically a metaphor for US actions in the Middle East. Noble warrior heroes? A culture that venerates soldiers for protecting the homeland/people/way of life by fighting. Diguised enemies working in outer territories? The war\u2019s not at home but somewhere else and the enemy isn\u2019t a typical government-lead army. The indigenous people get mostly ignored, viewed with reserved suspicion? That scene could\u2019ve been from so many war movies depicting conflicts from the last thirty years. <br/></p><p>And then it turns out that the terrorists are refugees. Not innocent, not unbloodied - they <i>have</i> been fighting against the Kree. But by all accounts, the Kree are the aggressor with superior forces and an advantage. They\u2019re labeling all Skrulls terrorists and hunting them down no matter the collateral damage - including the destruction of other worlds, other people. The noble warrior heroes are fighting a war that\u2019s neither noble nor heroic. <br/></p><p>And that\u2019s where the antimilitaristic, anti-<i>army</i> message drives home. Starforce is Air Force. Carol isn\u2019t actually dissociated from the army after all; she\u2019s <i>in</i> the army. But that army is in the wrong, is commiting atrocities, is lying to her - and when she finds out, she admits she\u2019s been fighting for the wrong cause and does the right thing, taking back her agency in the process.</p><p>Captain Marvel is the story of Carol Danvers becoming disillusioned with the army - any army, all armies, it doesn\u2019t matter - and dissociating herself from it.</p><p>Captain Marvel is not army propaganda.<br/></p>",
