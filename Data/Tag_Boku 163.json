We haven\u2019t seen Ochako actively control and manipulate objects (or people) she has used her quirk on in the way that water benders manipulate water.

        "body": "<h1>Toshinori X Inko- Dinner date? </h1><h2>Jac writing</h2><h2>Words: 1.1k</h2><h2>Warnings: none</h2><h2>This was a request</h2><p><br/></p><p>Toshinori smiled as Inko set down the food in front of him, both of them smiling at the delightful smell, \u201cThank you Midoriya-san, it looks amazing.\u201d he said in gratitude, Inko smiling as she sat down across from him, \u201coh it was really no trouble.\u201d she said easily with a wave of her hand, picking up her own chopsticks, \u201cthank you for being willing to come over, I\u2019ve been thinking about Izuku a lot lately now that he\u2019s not living at home, and I was just so curious about what all of you had been working on.\u201d she said sweetly, Toshinori nodding.</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s natural of a mother, and I&rsquo;m always willing to help. Your son is growing exceptionally.\u201d He answered kindly with a small smile. Inko smiled at this, \u201che always admired you so much as All Might, it\u2019s nice to see that you are just as good a teacher in this form as your other- we can\u2019t tell you how much we appreciate you.\u201d she said kindly, taking a bite of her food.</p><p>Toshinori let out a soft chuckle, dipping his head in thanks. \u201cYou flatter me, but thank you. I do know that I still have much to learn, and I&rsquo;m ready to do so alongside Izuku as well as provide guidance.\u201d Inko smiled at this, \u201cI think I can speak for everyone when we say we look forward to seeing the two of you learn together as he grows older- you know the boy is so destined on becoming the number one hero-\u201d she laughed, \u201csometimes I worry about how much effort he is putting into it, that he\u2019s not leaving himself time to actually be a teenager.\u201d she told Toshinori, the man giving a small laugh in return. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d he said, thinking of Izuku\u2019s sudden and new relationship with Ochako, as well as his good friendship with young Todoroki and Iida.</p><p>Inko smiled sweetly with a soft nod. \u201cI know, it&rsquo;s.. sometimes it&rsquo;s just my job to worry, as his mother.\u201d She replied with a shrug. All Might nodded. \u201cAnd that&rsquo;s normal, no one would blame you. He can be rather desperate to achieve his dream and prove himself at times, which can allow him to be reckless- but I do think he&rsquo;s coming to realize that and begin to fix it for himself, alongside the help his peers and teachers give.\u201d He tried to reassure</p><p>Inko nodded at this, both of them eating in silence for a bit longer until she spoke again, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve invited you over and only talked about my son-\u201d she laughed, \u201ctell me about you, do you spend time with family or with the other teachers on weekends?\u201d she asked casually.</p><p>All Might waved off her concerns with a smile. \u201cI mostly stay at the school, even during my spare time. There&rsquo;s often a lot of work to get done planning out the lessons and discussing student progress.\u201d He answered. Inko nodded but her smile fell a little bit, \u201cbut surely you see your family?\u201d she asked curiously.

Your son is growing exceptionally.\u201d He answered kindly with a small smile. Inko smiled at this, \u201che always admired you so much as All Might, it\u2019s nice to see that you are just as good a teacher in this form as your other- we can\u2019t tell you how much we appreciate you.\u201d she said kindly, taking a bite of her food.</p><p>Toshinori let out a soft chuckle, dipping his head in thanks. \u201cYou flatter me, but thank you. I do know that I still have much to learn, and I\u2019m ready to do so alongside Izuku as well as provide guidance.\u201d Inko smiled at this, \u201cI think I can speak for everyone when we say we look forward to seeing the two of you learn together as he grows older- you know the boy is so destined on becoming the number one hero-\u201d she laughed, \u201csometimes I worry about how much effort he is putting into it, that he\u2019s not leaving himself time to actually be a teenager.\u201d she told Toshinori, the man giving a small laugh in return. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d he said, thinking of Izuku\u2019s sudden and new relationship with Ochako, as well as his good friendship with young Todoroki and Iida.</p><p>Inko smiled sweetly with a soft nod. \u201cI know, it\u2019s.. sometimes it\u2019s just my job to worry, as his mother.\u201d She replied with a shrug. All Might nodded. \u201cAnd that\u2019s normal, no one would blame you. He can be rather desperate to achieve his dream and prove himself at times, which can allow him to be reckless- but I do think he\u2019s coming to realize that and begin to fix it for himself, alongside the help his peers and teachers give.\u201d He tried to reassure</p><p>Inko nodded at this, both of them eating in silence for a bit longer until she spoke again, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve invited you over and only talked about my son-\u201d she laughed, \u201ctell me about you, do you spend time with family or with the other teachers on weekends?\u201d she asked casually.</p><p>All Might waved off her concerns with a smile. \u201cI mostly stay at the school, even during my spare time.

I miss the company, honestly.&rdquo; She added with a shrug and a sheepish grin. He smiled back at her with a nod. &ldquo;Toshinori.&rdquo; He corrected. She blinked slightly in surprises, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; she asked questioningly, All Might smiling, &ldquo;please, call me Toshinori, I don&rsquo;t aim to be only seen as a pro hero.&rdquo; he said kindly.</p><p>She blinked in slight startlement for a moment or two, nodding with a small smile. &ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo; </p><p>The two of them continued to make polite conversation as they finished the rest of their dinner, Toshinori bringing up the subject of Izuku again after they were almost done. &ldquo;Where is young Midoriya tonight after all? It is the weekend, he should be at home resting.&rdquo; he observed.</p><p>I no looked up from her food toward the clock at the end of the room, &ldquo;he was out with friends, but he really should be getting home soon-&ldquo; she started right before the sound of the door opening interrupted her and she smiled with a small laugh as Izuku walked inside to remove his shoes. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey mom- hey All Mi-&ldquo; he started before freezing and filling into a bow quickly. &ldquo;All Might Sensei!&rdquo; He said quickly, sounding flustered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you would be here!&rdquo; He exclaimed, looking between his mother and Toshinori who only waved off his nervousness. &ldquo;Your mother was kind enough to invite me to dinner.&rdquo; He said with a smile, Izuku eyes darting between the two adults skeptically. </p><p>&ldquo;Is &hellip; this a date?&rdquo; He asked, his mouth getting away from him before he could think of what he was saying. All might choked on his water as Inkonreddened quickly. &ldquo;Izuku Midoriya!&rdquo; She scolded, Izuku quickly reddening as he realized his mistake. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah! My apologies- I&rsquo;m sorry- I didn&rsquo;t mean to-&ldquo; he rambled quickly. &ldquo;Go clean up and you can eat with us- there&rsquo;s food for you on the stove.&rdquo; Inko said strictly, Izuku giving another small bow before bolting to his room, Toshinori rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry about that All- uh- Toshinori.&rdquo; Inko said quickly, looking extremely embarrassed herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really alright- no need to worry yourself.&rdquo; Toshinori reassured quickly, but he couldn&rsquo;t help himself from thinking that he wouldn&rsquo;t mind it if this was considered a date. </p></p>",
