I\u2019m adding it to <a href=\"https://perksofhs.tumblr.com/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Words You Speak\u201d </a>series because I think it fits well!</i></p><p>He\u2019d started feeling ill a few days before Christmas Eve, a sniffly nose, sore throat, hot and cold sweats and a fever leading to the conclusion that he had in fact come down with a rather bad flu. He was nuzzled under a mound of blankets that every couple of hours would be thrown off at the onset of a hot sweat even though he knew he\u2019d be freezing in about 10 minutes and have to pull them all back up. He was surrounded by an ever growing number of used tissues and half empty cold and flu medicine packets. You\u2019d been there the whole time insisting that you loved being the care taker for him like he\u2019d done multiple times for you in the 10 months you\u2019d been together. And it was true, plus he was cute when he was sick, he was super cuddly, wanting nothing but you to be next to him holding him close. You knew getting sick yourself was inevitable but you really couldn\u2019t care less, he needed you and you relished in it.<br/></p><p>\u201cBaby you need to eat more than that, two spoonfuls isn\u2019t enough\u201d you said, trying to get him to have at least another few mouthfuls of the soup you had prepared but he refused like a stubborn child. \u201cC\u2019mon its pumpkin, your favourite, please baby have some more, I promise it will make you feel better\u201d he huffed and cautiously pushed himself up into a sitting position \u201cHm fine i\u2019ll have some more, but only because I love you\u201d. \u201cI love you too, plus you want to be better for Christmas Day, being sick on Christmas is the worst. Eat up buttercup! I\u2019m going to duck to the shop and grab a few things to finish out the Christmas shopping before it gets crazy over the next few days. That better be gone when I get back\u201d you said giving him a quick kiss on the lips. \u201cOk, can you get me some more tissues and cough drops? My throat is still killing me\u201d he said with a pout \u201cOk baby I\u2019ll add them to the list, I\u2019ll be back in an hour or so, don\u2019t forget to drink water, and take another cold and flu, the last one will be starting to wear off soon an-\u201d \u201cI think I can handle it babe, just go!\u201d Harry laughed, urging you to get out the door. \u201cFine! Fine! I\u2019m going! Love you baby\u201d you responded, grabbing your keys and twirling your scarf around your neck before opening the door and bracing the brisk December air. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d come home about 2 hours later, trudging inside struggling slightly with the 6 bags of last minute Christmas supplies and a few gifts. You walked down the hallway, dropping the bags on the kitchen island with thud. \u201cBaby how are you feeling? Did you take your cold and flu?\u201d you said, walking into the lounge only to be met with a very asleep Harry, cuddled deep into his blanket nest, messy curls stuck to his slightly sweaty forehead. You placed a soft kiss on his forehead before puling the blankets up slightly, doing your best to gently tuck him in. The room was a mess so you grabbed a spare plastic bag and started tidying the mess. Amongst the tissues, medicine and cough drop wrappers strewn across the coffee table was his leather bound journal, wide open with the a pen resting in the the middle of the two papers. As you reached across to grab the rubbish that surrounded it, you couldn\u2019t help but catch a glimpse of what was freshly written in the journal. What you read made your heart sink, <i>\u201cI really do love her, please don\u2019t let this be another failed relationship where the love is only from one side again. I don\u2019t think I could handle another broken heart at Christmas. I need her to love me too\u201d. </i>It took you a moment to process those words. Why would he ever think that you weren\u2019t truly in love with him? When he\u2019d said \u2018I love you\u2019 you\u2019d said it right back, tears in your eyes, no hesitation or questioning whether you loved him back because it was so obvious that you did. You knew his last couple of relationships didn\u2019t end well but you had no idea that his heart had been broken once or maybe twice at what was meant to be the most magical time of the year.</p><p>The sound of Harry starting to stir awake snapped you out of your thoughts, quickly swiping the last few tissues into the bag, flipping the journal closed as if you\u2019d read nothing. Although you couldn\u2019t hide the sadness in your face, the fact that you were on the verge of tears was all too evident. \u201cMmm baby you\u2019re back\u201d Harry mumbled, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. \u201cYep, got everything done, all ready for Christmas day now.\u201d you tried to brush off what you\u2019d just found out but your voice was every so slightly wavering. \u201cBabe are you ok? you sound sad\u201d He said, reaching out to grab your free hand, stopping you from trying to walk away. A tear slid down your cheek at his words, you frantically tried to wipe it away and brush it off \u201cYeah yeah I\u2019m fine\u201d you assured but he wasn\u2019t that stupid. \u201cNo you\u2019re not, what happened? Did something happen while you were out? Are you hurt?\u201d he worried about you going out by yourself now that your relationship was known to the world. Your features softened, you debated with yourself on whether to mention what you\u2019d just read, on one hand it\u2019s a massive invasion of privacy and it was obviously not meant for your eyes to see but you also needed him to understand that you were committed, fully, to this relationship, to him. \u201cBaby you know I love you right? No ifs ands or buts, I really truly love you\u201d you said, finalising your decision, not answering the questions he\u2019d posed. For a moment he looked completely confused, the sudden profession of your love for him taking him by surprise but then it clicked and his eyes flicked across to his journal.</p><p>His expression changed to one of guilt. \u201cDid I do something that made you question it? Do I not show it enough? I don\u2019t know what else I can do!\u201d you said, kneeling down to his level, taking his hands into yours, him gripping them tighter than he ever had. \u201cNo baby its nothing you did, I\u2019ve just had so many failed relationships that I can\u2019t turn my brain off when it starts questioning things. You know it was around Christmas two years ago that my last proper relationship broke down?\u201d He was nearly crying, his already red eyes welling up. You knew his last girlfriend was a piece of work but you never imagined she\u2019d be that heartless, especially at Christmas. \u201cHarry I had no idea\u201d you said, placing your hands on his cheeks, lifting his tired sad eyes to meet your similarly watery ones \u201cI can promise you though, right here right now, that that will never happen with me. I love you more than I have ever loved anyone. Not only have you added to my life in the most positive way but you have changed me for the better. You helped me realise my worth. You are the most kind, most genuine, most loving partner I have ever have and ever intend on having because you are my end zone Harry. There is no doubt in my mind that you are my person and you shouldn\u2019t have any doubt either. I love you H, and I will forever.\u201d The tears were rolling down his cheeks, as they were yours, a watery smile on his lips. You pulled in him, placing your lips ever so gently on his, solidifying the words that you\u2019d just said. His hands rose to your cheeks, wiping away your tears. \u201cThank you\u201d is all he could manage to say. \u201cThank you for what?\u201d you enquired, puzzled by his response. \u201cThank you for loving me, for loving me entirely. I love you so much\u201d he said before pulling you up into the warmest hug. You smiled, finally content with him knowing that there was never a need to be insecure, you loved him and he loved you and that was that.</p><p>You pulled away from the hug, sniffing back the rest of the tears \u201cOk now that we\u2019ve got that all sorted, have you taken your cold and flu? You\u2019re feeling a little warm\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at you getting straight back into carer mode. \u201cI did take them and I ate all of my soup I promise, all I want right now is for you to stay here with me, I need a proper cuddle.\u201d You laughed, happily obliging, plopping yourself down next to him, his arms wrapping themselves securely around your waist with yours around his neck \u201cI love you baby\u201d you said, pecking a kiss to his slightly sweaty neck \u201cI love you too baby, so much\u201d he said, placing a soft kiss on your forehead before closing his eyes contently asking himself what he ever did to deserve any of this.</p><p>Ok lovelies I\u2019m sorry this took me literally two weeks to get this done! Christmas and New Years was a bit of a whirlwind at my house! This yet another instalment of the \u2018The Words You Speak\u2019 series!

My throat is still killing me\u201d he said with a pout \u201cOk baby I\u2019ll add them to the list, I\u2019ll be back in an hour or so, don\u2019t forget to drink water, and take another cold and flu, the last one will be starting to wear off soon an-\u201d \u201cI think I can handle it babe, just go!\u201d Harry laughed, urging you to get out the door. \u201cFine! Fine! I\u2019m going! Love you baby\u201d you responded, grabbing your keys and twirling your scarf around your neck before opening the door and bracing the brisk December air. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d come home about 2 hours later, trudging inside struggling slightly with the 6 bags of last minute Christmas supplies and a few gifts. You walked down the hallway, dropping the bags on the kitchen island with thud. \u201cBaby how are you feeling? Did you take your cold and flu?\u201d you said, walking into the lounge only to be met with a very asleep Harry, cuddled deep into his blanket nest, messy curls stuck to his slightly sweaty forehead. You placed a soft kiss on his forehead before puling the blankets up slightly, doing your best to gently tuck him in. The room was a mess so you grabbed a spare plastic bag and started tidying the mess. Amongst the tissues, medicine and cough drop wrappers strewn across the coffee table was his leather bound journal, wide open with the a pen resting in the the middle of the two papers. As you reached across to grab the rubbish that surrounded it, you couldn\u2019t help but catch a glimpse of what was freshly written in the journal. What you read made your heart sink, <i>\u201cI really do love her, please don\u2019t let this be another failed relationship where the love is only from one side again. I don\u2019t think I could handle another broken heart at Christmas. I need her to love me too\u201d. </i>It took you a moment to process those words. Why would he ever think that you weren\u2019t truly in love with him? When he\u2019d said \u2018I love you\u2019 you\u2019d said it right back, tears in your eyes, no hesitation or questioning whether you loved him back because it was so obvious that you did. You knew his last couple of relationships didn\u2019t end well but you had no idea that his heart had been broken once or maybe twice at what was meant to be the most magical time of the year.</p><p>The sound of Harry starting to stir awake snapped you out of your thoughts, quickly swiping the last few tissues into the bag, flipping the journal closed as if you\u2019d read nothing. Although you couldn\u2019t hide the sadness in your face, the fact that you were on the verge of tears was all too evident. \u201cMmm baby you\u2019re back\u201d Harry mumbled, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. \u201cYep, got everything done, all ready for Christmas day now.\u201d you tried to brush off what you\u2019d just found out but your voice was every so slightly wavering. \u201cBabe are you ok? you sound sad\u201d He said, reaching out to grab your free hand, stopping you from trying to walk away. A tear slid down your cheek at his words, you frantically tried to wipe it away and brush it off \u201cYeah yeah I\u2019m fine\u201d you assured but he wasn\u2019t that stupid. \u201cNo you\u2019re not, what happened? Did something happen while you were out? Are you hurt?\u201d he worried about you going out by yourself now that your relationship was known to the world. Your features softened, you debated with yourself on whether to mention what you\u2019d just read, on one hand it\u2019s a massive invasion of privacy and it was obviously not meant for your eyes to see but you also needed him to understand that you were committed, fully, to this relationship, to him. \u201cBaby you know I love you right? No ifs ands or buts, I really truly love you\u201d you said, finalising your decision, not answering the questions he\u2019d posed. For a moment he looked completely confused, the sudden profession of your love for him taking him by surprise but then it clicked and his eyes flicked across to his journal.</p><p>His expression changed to one of guilt. \u201cDid I do something that made you question it? Do I not show it enough? I don\u2019t know what else I can do!\u201d you said, kneeling down to his level, taking his hands into yours, him gripping them tighter than he ever had. \u201cNo baby its nothing you did, I\u2019ve just had so many failed relationships that I can\u2019t turn my brain off when it starts questioning things. You know it was around Christmas two years ago that my last proper relationship broke down?\u201d He was nearly crying, his already red eyes welling up. You knew his last girlfriend was a piece of work but you never imagined she\u2019d be that heartless, especially at Christmas. \u201cHarry I had no idea\u201d you said, placing your hands on his cheeks, lifting his tired sad eyes to meet your similarly watery ones \u201cI can promise you though, right here right now, that that will never happen with me. I love you more than I have ever loved anyone. Not only have you added to my life in the most positive way but you have changed me for the better. You helped me realise my worth. You are the most kind, most genuine, most loving partner I have ever have and ever intend on having because you are my end zone Harry. There is no doubt in my mind that you are my person and you shouldn\u2019t have any doubt either. I love you H, and I will forever.\u201d The tears were rolling down his cheeks, as they were yours, a watery smile on his lips. You pulled in him, placing your lips ever so gently on his, solidifying the words that you\u2019d just said. His hands rose to your cheeks, wiping away your tears. \u201cThank you\u201d is all he could manage to say. \u201cThank you for what?\u201d you enquired, puzzled by his response. \u201cThank you for loving me, for loving me entirely. I love you so much\u201d he said before pulling you up into the warmest hug. You smiled, finally content with him knowing that there was never a need to be insecure, you loved him and he loved you and that was that.</p><p>You pulled away from the hug, sniffing back the rest of the tears \u201cOk now that we\u2019ve got that all sorted, have you taken your cold and flu? You\u2019re feeling a little warm\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at you getting straight back into carer mode. \u201cI did take them and I ate all of my soup I promise, all I want right now is for you to stay here with me, I need a proper cuddle.\u201d You laughed, happily obliging, plopping yourself down next to him, his arms wrapping themselves securely around your waist with yours around his neck \u201cI love you baby\u201d you said, pecking a kiss to his slightly sweaty neck \u201cI love you too baby, so much\u201d he said, placing a soft kiss on your forehead before closing his eyes contently asking himself what he ever did to deserve any of this.</p><p>Ok lovelies I\u2019m sorry this took me literally two weeks to get this done!

I\u2019m adding it to <a href=\"https://perksofhs.tumblr.com/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Words You Speak\u201d </a>series because I think it fits well!</i></p><p>He\u2019d started feeling ill a few days before Christmas Eve, a sniffly nose, sore throat, hot and cold sweats and a fever leading to the conclusion that he had in fact come down with a rather bad flu. He was nuzzled under a mound of blankets that every couple of hours would be thrown off at the onset of a hot sweat even though he knew he\u2019d be freezing in about 10 minutes and have to pull them all back up. He was surrounded by an ever growing number of used tissues and half empty cold and flu medicine packets. You\u2019d been there the whole time insisting that you loved being the care taker for him like he\u2019d done multiple times for you in the 10 months you\u2019d been together. And it was true, plus he was cute when he was sick, he was super cuddly, wanting nothing but you to be next to him holding him close. You knew getting sick yourself was inevitable but you really couldn\u2019t care less, he needed you and you relished in it.<br></p><p>\u201cBaby you need to eat more than that, two spoonfuls isn\u2019t enough\u201d you said, trying to get him to have at least another few mouthfuls of the soup you had prepared but he refused like a stubborn child. \u201cC\u2019mon its pumpkin, your favourite, please baby have some more, I promise it will make you feel better\u201d he huffed and cautiously pushed himself up into a sitting position \u201cHm fine i\u2019ll have some more, but only because I love you\u201d. \u201cI love you too, plus you want to be better for Christmas Day, being sick on Christmas is the worst. Eat up buttercup! I\u2019m going to duck to the shop and grab a few things to finish out the Christmas shopping before it gets crazy over the next few days. That better be gone when I get back\u201d you said giving him a quick kiss on the lips. \u201cOk, can you get me some more tissues and cough drops?

You&rsquo;re feeling a little warm&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle at you getting straight back into carer mode. &ldquo;I did take them and I ate all of my soup I promise, all I want right now is for you to stay here with me, I need a proper cuddle.&rdquo; You laughed, happily obliging, plopping yourself down next to him, his arms wrapping themselves securely around your waist with yours around his neck &ldquo;I love you baby&rdquo; you said, pecking a kiss to his slightly sweaty neck &ldquo;I love you too baby, so much&rdquo; he said, placing a soft kiss on your forehead before closing his eyes contently asking himself what he ever did to deserve any of this.</p><p>Ok lovelies I&rsquo;m sorry this took me literally two weeks to get this done! Christmas and New Years was a bit of a whirlwind at my house! This yet another instalment of the &lsquo;The Words You Speak&rsquo; series!
