        "question": "Would you do a fluff alphabet with loki?",
        "answer": "<p><i>Sure, no problem :3 I hope you like it :) Sorry that some parts got rather short D:</i></p><hr><p>\n\n<b>A = Attractive </b>(What do they find attractive about the other?) <br/></p><p>Ehm, what do people not like about Loki? Loki is perfect. You love his voice. It is so silky and smooth. You could listen to him all day. Besides his voice, you love his hair, his body, his personality. Just everything. You could watch him and listen to him all day if you could.</p><p>Loki loves your personality. You don\u2019t just say\u00a0\u2018Yes\u2019 and he could talk with you for hours about everything and nothing. You even did not flinch at his antics and about that he was grateful.</p><!-- more --><p>\n\n<b>B = Baby </b>(Do they want a family? Why/Why not?) <br/></p><p>Both would need some time until they would say they want a family. Should they make a family, Loki would like just one kid so that no kid gets neglected. Loki also knows how it is to live the shadow from an older sibling and he does not want it to happen to his child.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>C = Cuddle </b>(How do they cuddle?) <br/></p><p>Loki loves do be sneaky. He would come from behind and hug you, his chin resting on your shoulder while you do something.\u00a0</p><p>When Loki sits on the couch, you would just drop on his lap and don\u2019t let him go. He would pretend that he does not like all the cuddles he has with you but secretly he adores them. His cuddles are gentle and sometimes a little bit teasing. He likes to stroke your skin and sometimes even pinch it when he sees that you start to nod off and he wants to tease you.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>D = Dates </b>(What are dates with them like?) <br/></p><p>I think Loki likes fancy dates. Eating at an expensive restaurant would be his choice. You like more informal dates like going to a picnic, visiting the cinema or just chilling together at home.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>E = Everything </b>(You are my ____ (e.g. my life, my world\u2026)) <br/></p><p>\u201cYou are my queen.\u201d, would Loki say.\u00a0He sees you as his equal and he can\u2019t imagine being without you anymore. He knows that many (nearly all) people hate him and would love it to see him dead, but you are different. You gave him a chance, even when he was mean to you at first.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>F = Feelings </b>(When did they know they were in love?) <br/></p><p>Loki would notice that he begins to get feelings for you but he would ignore them. He can not believe that he begins to love someone, especially a human from Midgard. Loki ignored them and suppressed\u00a0them until you came and kissed him while you declared your love to him, then he had no other chance to admit his feeling (or lose you).\u00a0</p><p>You noticed your feelings pretty soon. After he said something to you, you would notice that your fondness was not only fondness rather than love.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>G = Gentle </b>(Are they gentle? If so, how?) <br/></p><p>Loki can be very gentle. He shows you with gentleness his love. He would stroke your hair, sometimes hug you very tenderly or give you a butterfly kiss, but Loki can also be very rough, especially in bed. He even tends to be only rough in bed but should you wish otherwise he would be this one time gentle for you.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0<b>H = Hands </b>(How do they like to hold hands?)</p><p>Loki does not like it very much to hold hands. Sometimes he would do it to show the men that you are his but he would rather show that with hickeys.\u00a0</p><p>You on the other side loves to hold hands so sometimes you grab his hand and he pulls it away just so you can grab it again. After some time one of you two would give up, it would mainly be Loki and you would then pout.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>J = Jealousy </b>(Do they get jealous?) <br/></p><p>He can get jealous. Loki does not like it when somebody touches you or dares to show to much interest to you. He would show them all that you are his and that you only belong to him and nobody else. So, you should not make him jealous so he gives so attention except you want to be roughly fucked.\u00a0</p><p>You can get jealous but not very easily. You trust him and you know he is a faithful man, even when he lies and manipulates. He likes it when you sometimes get jealous. You get very confident and you would show everybody that he is yours.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>K = Kiss </b>(How do they kiss? Who initiated the first kiss?) <br/></p><p>You would be the one who initiated the first kiss. While Loki tried to ignore his own feelings for you, you knew of your feelings and acted on them. On one day you had enough and walked straight to him, grabbing him at his collar and pulling him down to you. Without to falter you would press your lips onto his and kiss him. Your kisses are very passionate and sometimes even full of lust. On lazy days there would be lazy, gentle kisses, small pecks or some deep, love filled kisses. You two had a big spectrum of different kisses.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>L = Love</b> (Who says \u2018I love you\u2019 first?) <br/></p><p>You would first say, that you love him. After a big fight with him about humans and how he should not be here because all would hate him and you could not stand it anymore, you would scream into his face that you love him and that you don\u2019t want to lose him. He would be shellshocked but outwardly he would just pause and then lightly smile. In the night he would sometimes whisper into your ear that he loved you.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>M = Memory</b> (What\u2019s their favorite memory together?) <br/></p><p>Their favorite memory together was the first time they had sex together. It was, in general, your first time and it was very passionate and gentle while Loki leads you through it. You both worked through everything slowly and took enough time until you both were ready. Afterward, you two would cuddle while you were talking to each other and recovering.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>N = Nickel </b>(Do they spoil? Do they buy the person they love everything?) <br/></p><p>Loki would not very often give you presents. Should he give you something it would often be books or going together somewhere and doing something romantic. On every anniversary or on your birthday or Christmas he would buy you something other than books. Things, you truly wish and he noticed you looking at them.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>O = Orange </b>(What colour reminds them of their other half?) <br/></p><p>Loki would say, you are the color red. It reminds him of love and passion and for him, you are exactly that. Sometimes he would also say it is your color because you get so easy red around him.</p><p>For Loki is the color green perfect. You love his green eyes and he loves also the color green since you wear only green or black. It suits him and you like it.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>P = Pet names </b>(What pet names do they use?) <br/></p><p>You don\u2019t use any names on him. He would like it if you would call him more\u00a0\u201cGod.\u201d since you scream that often while sex but he also knows that you do not mean him, but he would like it if you would call him so.\u00a0</p><p>He calls you sometimes darling when you two are alone and intimate but besides that, he just uses your name.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>Q = Quaint </b>(What is their favorite non-modern thing?) <br/></p><p>Books. You both like books and reading and talking about books. Sometimes you two would talk about books for hours and the people (Avengers) would get annoyed about you two and just go somewhere else.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>R = Rainy Day </b>(What do they like to do on a rainy day?) <br/></p><p>Well, it is a bit obvious. Either fucking or reading. They like to be intimate and for them are both option intimate. You both are relaxed and without any guard so it is very intimate for you two. Sometimes you would cuddle and watch TV.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>S = Sad </b>(How do they cheer themselves/others up?) <br/></p><p>Loki doesn\u2019t talk about his problems. You notice it just when he has a nightmare and wakes you up with it. Even then he would often not talk about it. He would just lay in your arms and try to calm down. On very rare events he would talk a bit about his problems but he rather ignores them.</p><p>You on the other side talk open about your problems, even when he sometimes does not understand. He still offers you support and comfort when you are felling down.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>U = Unencumbered </b>(What helps them relax?) <br/></p><p>Loki would never admit it but he relaxes the most when he lays in your arms and you are stroking his hair, silently talking with him.\u00a0</p><p>You relax the best when you two are cuddling with each other, he would run his fingers over your body, sometimes even teasing you. He would talk about Asgard or some adventures he had, quietly telling you these stories. Soon you would nod off and fall asleep on him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>V = Vaunt </b>(What do they like to show off? What are they proud of?) <br/></p><p>Loki likes to show off his magic. He would make some illusions of him, confusing you and silently laughing when you would get annoyed at him because of that. Sometimes he likes to show off his silver tongue. Talking you out of things or convince you to do something.</p><p>You like it use your body to tease him, to distract him and make him horny. He teases you all the time and you don\u2019t have magic to annoy him too, so you have to use something else and when he sees you in Dessous but pointedly ignoring him, he can\u2019t take your eyes off him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>W = Wedding </b>(When, how, where do they propose?) <br/></p><p>Loki would only propose to you when he has a very strong bond with you while you two are for years together. A plus would also be if you were pregnant, then he would maybe sooner propose to you. He would also show with the ring that you are his and would happily (and smug) tell that you are his fianc\u00e9e.\u00a0</p><p>He would plan the entire evening and then propose when you two are alone together.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>X = Xylophone </b>(What\u2019s their song?) <br/></p><p>I don\u2019t know which song would be theirs.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>Y = Yes </b>(Do they ever think of getting married/proposing?) <br/></p><p>Just like said, they would only marry after a long time together, maybe sooner should you get pregnant.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>Z = Zebra </b>(If they wanted a pet, what would they get?) <br/></p><p>They would get a cat. It would not be overly dependent on them but still be there. Also, it would be a diva, just like Loki. It would also be a female.\u00a0</p>",

Do they buy the person they love everything?) <br></p><p>Loki would not very often give you presents.

Loki is perfect. You love his voice. It is so silky and smooth. You could listen to him all day. Besides his voice, you love his hair, his body, his personality. Just everything. You could watch him and listen to him all day if you could.</p><p>Loki loves your personality. You don\u2019t just say\u00a0\u2018Yes\u2019 and he could talk with you for hours about everything and nothing. You even did not flinch at his antics and about that he was grateful.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\n<b>B = Baby </b>(Do they want a family? Why/Why not?) <br></p><p>Both would need some time until they would say they want a family. Should they make a family, Loki would like just one kid so that no kid gets neglected. Loki also knows how it is to live the shadow from an older sibling and he does not want it to happen to his child.</p><p><br></p><p>\n\n<b>C = Cuddle </b>(How do they cuddle?) <br></p><p>Loki loves do be sneaky.

Afterward, you two would cuddle while you were talking to each other and recovering.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>N = Nickel </b>(Do they spoil? Do they buy the person they love everything?) <br /></p><p>Loki would not very often give you presents. Should he give you something it would often be books or going together somewhere and doing something romantic. On every anniversary or on your birthday or Christmas he would buy you something other than books. Things, you truly wish and he noticed you looking at them.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>O = Orange </b>(What colour reminds them of their other half?) <br /></p><p>Loki would say, you are the color red. It reminds him of love and passion and for him, you are exactly that. Sometimes he would also say it is your color because you get so easy red around him.</p><p>For Loki is the color green perfect. You love his green eyes and he loves also the color green since you wear only green or black. It suits him and you like it.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>P = Pet names </b>(What pet names do they use?) <br /></p><p>You don&rsquo;t use any names on him. He would like it if you would call him more&nbsp;&ldquo;God.&rdquo; since you scream that often while sex but he also knows that you do not mean him, but he would like it if you would call him so.&nbsp;</p><p>He calls you sometimes darling when you two are alone and intimate but besides that, he just uses your name.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>Q = Quaint </b>(What is their favorite non-modern thing?) <br /></p><p>Books. You both like books and reading and talking about books. Sometimes you two would talk about books for hours and the people (Avengers) would get annoyed about you two and just go somewhere else.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>R = Rainy Day </b>(What do they like to do on a rainy day?) <br /></p><p>Well, it is a bit obvious. Either fucking or reading. They like to be intimate and for them are both option intimate. You both are relaxed and without any guard so it is very intimate for you two. Sometimes you would cuddle and watch TV.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>S = Sad </b>(How do they cheer themselves/others up?) <br /></p><p>Loki doesn&rsquo;t talk about his problems. You notice it just when he has a nightmare and wakes you up with it. Even then he would often not talk about it. He would just lay in your arms and try to calm down. On very rare events he would talk a bit about his problems but he rather ignores them.</p><p>You on the other side talk open about your problems, even when he sometimes does not understand. He still offers you support and comfort when you are felling down.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>U = Unencumbered </b>(What helps them relax?) <br /></p><p>Loki would never admit it but he relaxes the most when he lays in your arms and you are stroking his hair, silently talking with him.&nbsp;</p><p>You relax the best when you two are cuddling with each other, he would run his fingers over your body, sometimes even teasing you. He would talk about Asgard or some adventures he had, quietly telling you these stories. Soon you would nod off and fall asleep on him.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>V = Vaunt </b>(What do they like to show off? What are they proud of?) <br /></p><p>Loki likes to show off his magic. He would make some illusions of him, confusing you and silently laughing when you would get annoyed at him because of that. Sometimes he likes to show off his silver tongue. Talking you out of things or convince you to do something.</p><p>You like it use your body to tease him, to distract him and make him horny. He teases you all the time and you don&rsquo;t have magic to annoy him too, so you have to use something else and when he sees you in Dessous but pointedly ignoring him, he can&rsquo;t take your eyes off him.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>W = Wedding </b>(When, how, where do they propose?) <br /></p><p>Loki would only propose to you when he has a very strong bond with you while you two are for years together. A plus would also be if you were pregnant, then he would maybe sooner propose to you. He would also show with the ring that you are his and would happily (and smug) tell that you are his fianc&eacute;e.&nbsp;</p><p>He would plan the entire evening and then propose when you two are alone together.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>X = Xylophone </b>(What&rsquo;s their song?) <br /></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know which song would be theirs.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>Y = Yes </b>(Do they ever think of getting married/proposing?) <br /></p><p>Just like said, they would only marry after a long time together, maybe sooner should you get pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n<b>Z = Zebra </b>(If they wanted a pet, what would they get?) <br /></p><p>They would get a cat. It would not be overly dependent on them but still be there. Also, it would be a diva, just like Loki. It would also be a female.&nbsp;</p>",

Loki is perfect. You love his voice. It is so silky and smooth. You could listen to him all day. Besides his voice, you love his hair, his body, his personality. Just everything. You could watch him and listen to him all day if you could.</p>\n<p>Loki loves your personality. You don&rsquo;t just say&nbsp;&lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and he could talk with you for hours about everything and nothing. You even did not flinch at his antics and about that he was grateful.</p>\n</p>",

Keep sending requests in! </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You looked at yourself in the mirror one last time before heading to downstairs, today would be the day you were going to end this battle with Steve Rogers once and for all. The two of you had a, well weird relationship. There was no doubt that the two of you harbored feelings for the other, it was just a matter of who would finally crack from the competition and ask the other out.</p><p>See, the two of you were battling in what you were calling a contest. Everyday the two of you would flirt with each other, but whoever blushed the most from the others compliments lost. For the most part you were winning, always catching him by surprise with your comments. Tonight however you planned to lose.</p><p>You were so sick of waiting for Steve to ask you out that you decided you were going to do it yourself, making reservations for the two of you at a very nice restaurant downtown. You were going to win this battle, then ask him to dinner. Because for the love of all that&rsquo;s mighty you wanted to be with him more than anything and you were becoming impatient. So you had thrown on a beautiful skin tight navy blue dress, some overly high heels, did hair and makeup were absolutely perfect and headed downstairs.</p><p>Little did you know, your super soldier had a similar idea. Steve was just as fed up with this little game as you were and tonight would be the night it all changed. He loved everything about you, most importantly that you saw him as more than just a superhero. You saw and loved the real Steve Rogers, and to him that was just one of the the many reasons he fell for you. You were the complete package. </p><p>He decided that he was going to win, then finally to ask you to dinner. He made sure he was dressed up, ready for the moment he saw you. He was going to use every compliment that came to mind when he saw you and make sure you knew just how special he thought you were. But he hadn&rsquo;t seen you for most of the day.</p><p>He was about to give up on his idea when he looked up the stairs and there you were. You were radiant, his eyes danced across your figure taking in the enchanting sight in front of him. He felt his mouth become dry and his palms become damp as he stared up at you. Then his heart sank, who were you so dressed up for?</p><p>You walked down the stairs maintaining eye contact with him a blush lightly coating your cheeks, &ldquo;Hi Steve, you look handsome.&rdquo; Steve felt his own cheeks begin to heat up, his hand rubbing at the back of his neck, &ldquo;(y/n) you look absolutely breathtaking tonight.&rdquo; You smiled your cheeks getting warmer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so, I did it for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve cheeks were burning, his plan was backfiring in front of him. But somehow he didn&rsquo;t mind, you had gotten dressed up for him? He didn&rsquo;t fully believe your words,&ldquo;Wh-What do you mean?&rdquo; You leaned up kissing his cheek, knowing that you had just won the competition, &ldquo;I was hoping you&rsquo;d join me for dinner tonight Captain. I&rsquo;d been waiting so long for you to ask me I decided to do it myself.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve beamed, his face redder than a rose, &ldquo;You laugh, but I was going to ask you out tonight after I won this battle.&rdquo;  You laughed grabbing his hand in your own, &ldquo;Well Cap, it&rsquo;s the 21st century, better get used to a woman winning.&rdquo; He chuckled shaking his head before kissing your forehead lightly, &ldquo;Doll I wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose to anyone else.&rdquo; </p><p>You grinned leaning up to kiss him when you heard an exasperated sigh from the couch, where a very irritated Bucky was sitting besides Sam, &ldquo;You guys couldn&rsquo;t have waited one more goddamn week?! I&rsquo;m out $50!&rdquo; You heard Sam laugh, &ldquo;I told you they wouldn&rsquo;t make it another week before one of them caved.&rdquo; You laughed at the two arguing men on the couch looking back at Steve happily, &ldquo;Where were we?&rdquo; </p><p>Steve chuckled cupping your cheek in his hand, &ldquo;I think I was losing.&rdquo; You nodded slightly, &ldquo;Oh right and I was about to kiss you first.&rdquo; Steve smirked, determination on his face, &ldquo;Not if I do it first.&rdquo; You quickly leaned up kissing him, pulling away when both of you ran out of air, &ldquo;I told you Steve, I never lose.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QBjEbO5niGUOoQ31qyjKA\">@m-a-t-91</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMauQ5okS7eo-NL_w5uNsLw\">@thebuckboibarnes</a> </p></p>",
