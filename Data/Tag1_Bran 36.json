Certainly not the way they positioned him in the GOT finale, with him setting up a Small Council and them still ruling from KL and still using the Red Keep. And that&rsquo;s not just because Season 8 did nothing to make the case for Bran as a ruler. Although it certainly did nothing to make the case for Bran as a ruler.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s being set up as a ruler in the books, either.</p><p>But he could be an <i>advisor</i> to rulers.</p><p>A ruler isn&rsquo;t just someone running the show. A ruler is someone who inspires the people. Tywin was an administrator. He was never a ruler, and that&rsquo;s because people didn&rsquo;t fucking <i>like</i> Tywin and he didn&rsquo;t want them to. Tyrion is an administrator and advisor. He&rsquo;s not a ruler and he doesn&rsquo;t intend to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon, for the short time he was KitN, was a ruler. Robb was a ruler. He went out there and dealt with his people. Did he do it especially well? He certainly didn&rsquo;t do it perfectly, but he accepted the role. Sansa is a ruler. She plants her feet in place and deals with her bannermen and looks after her people.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t see Bran, even in the books, being set up to fill that role. For one thing he&rsquo;s still a very little boy. The way he makes decisions is not accessible to the people.</p><p>A book-version arrangement that I think is much more plausible is that the Three-Eyed Raven becomes the head of a council of rulers of the kingdoms.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially in a story in which Bran contributes something essential to the fight for the living. Something a bit more relevant than serving as bait for the Night King. If the 3ER&rsquo;s powers are necessary to avert the Snow Zombie Apocalypse, the other leaders would want to keep him in an advisory/ombudsman position.</p><p>And when I say&nbsp;&ldquo;other leaders,&rdquo; I mean it&rsquo;s not just the North being independent while all the other kingdoms are together. I mean the destruction of KL is so thorough there&rsquo;s no way to maintain a centralized authority over the realm. So the realm splits apart into autonomous kingdoms. Could be as few as 4 kingdoms, could be as many as 8 (including the Riverlands), hell, could end up being more than that. But rather than revert to the hot mess from before Aegon&rsquo;s Conquest, the rulers of the kingdoms form a council so they can stay connected and cooperating, and the 3ER is the overseer of that council. And part of the duty of the council is to support the 3ER in nurturing and training a new 3ER so there&rsquo;s always someone ready to fill that role. I can see Bran being set up for the overseer position, book version.&nbsp;</p>",
