But after she receives the letter, wearing that braid is part of armouring herself again. Not to merely appeal to his obsession but to steel herself. Her modest clothing that has echoes of Cat contrasts her revealing Eyrie dress. She is completely covered up. Neither is she wearing a dress that mimics Littlefinger. Her dress is like Catelyn\u2019s but the colours are of House Stark.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"951\" data-orig-height=\"688\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b76c2abd96463b7b09d1dd402f6aa5a2/tumblr_inline_pfvl1sDo3h1u48vsz_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"951\" data-orig-height=\"688\"/></figure><p>She goes with Brienne and even the direction of the scene is done such that Littlefinger is happy to see Sansa but Brienne enters after her and his face falls. He wasn\u2019t expecting her to have taken Brienne\u2019s protection because she rejected it once and her presence is a statement that Sansa isn\u2019t dependent on his protection as she once was.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"922\" data-orig-height=\"489\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30daf076eeed2b39b1f15944cf56d0f8/tumblr_inline_pfvmn271id1u48vsz_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"922\" data-orig-height=\"489\"/></figure><p>It has far more in common with Cat in this 2x04 scene with Littlefinger.\u00a0<strike>Anyway I\u2019m going to always be bitter that the show never included the book scene of Sansa sneaking away to the godswood to meet Dontos with a knife in hand for self defence.\u00a0</strike></p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DkIwlfcKjnAQ\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIwlfcKjnAQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>Cat is far more on the offensive at first but then Littlefinger needles away at her weaknesses - first her wanting to get back her daughters and later by bringing her Ned\u2019s bones. He does so by suggesting that she could barter Jaime for her daughters (when Arya isn\u2019t even there).\u00a0</p><p>Unlike Cat, in 6x05 Sansa tries to hold her ground and keep her emotions except disdain at bay. But he does shake a vein there by reminding her that Jon isn\u2019t her brother like Robb or Bran or Rickon; he\u2019s her half-brother. One that she was never close to and one that her mother distrusted. He does so while reminding her that the lords of the Vale remain loyal to her and Blackfish, her mother\u2019s uncle is someone she should look to.\u00a0</p><p>People that keep saying Sansa is \u201cstupid\u201d for constantly relying on Littlefinger after he betrays her, don\u2019t consider he fools Cat after she starts doubting him too and with Sansa, who is far more dependent on a protector to keep her safe and someone he essentially groomed as an abuser, he preys off her fears that she is alone even more. She\u2019s faced longterm abuse under different abusers but showwise, Littlefinger has been her abuser longer than anyone else. Unlike other abusers he also creates the impression that he cares about her in a way others can\u2019t. So after being stripped away from so much trust of goodness in the world, in love or god, she believes this terrible \u201clove\u201d is probably the best she\u2019ll ever get or that it\u2019s all she deserves.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He tries to alienate her from Jon (and practically everyone else) so she can only depend on him, as he did with Brienne before. And considering the journey that Sansa has been through, she\u2019s been reminded time and again that she shouldn\u2019t trust anyone and been called foolish for doing so. Thus, even after she finally meets another Stark at last, she has to wonder if she really can trust him. She trusted her aunt Lysa and she tried to kill her. Littlefinger reminds her of her worst insecurities: that she\u2019s letting her guard down too much. He reminds her that she can\u2019t go back to being that little girl again. Hence that line \u201cNo one can protect me. No one can protect anyone\u201d later.\u00a0While I don\u2019t think she was right in doubting Jon, it\u2019s <i>understandable</i> considering the journey she went through and the number of people who have exploited her or tried to harm her.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"954\" data-orig-height=\"495\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4ab7ba7d6e6fe421351daea6953f78b/tumblr_inline_pfw6hi2Z0X1u48vsz_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"954\" data-orig-height=\"495\"/></figure><p>She has moments when she wears her hair like her childhood Northern style after this. This is contextualised by her telling Brienne \u201c<i>Jon isn\u2019t Tormund. Jon isn\u2019t Davos or the Red Woman or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He\u2019s my brother.<i> </i>He\u2019ll keep me safe. <i><i>I trust him.</i></i></i>\u201d and Brienne points out that if she does, then why she lie to him about Blackfish when she knows he\u2019s not like the others. This scene shows that she <i>wants</i> to trust Jon, but Littlefinger hit a vein there and she\u2019s scared of putting that amount of trust in him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>So from this moment onwards until the end of the Battle of the Bastards, Sansa continues wearing her mother\u2019s Tully braid as an armor that screams\u00a0\u201cback off\u201d to everyone than her use of it at the end of season 4, where she was attempting to use Cersei\u2019s and Margaery\u2019s tactics of seducing the enemy to survive.\u00a0However, as I\u2019ve said before Cat herself has a number of hairstyles apart from braids, i.e. semi-tied hair or buns. The nods to Lyanna are far more subtle because Sansa never met her and her statue isn\u2019t exactly very revealing of her appearance, but the elements that make their way into Sansa\u2019s look shows her Northernness. \u00a0</p><p>She uses aspects of Catelyn and Lyanna at different points by merging them with some aspect of Cersei or Margaery because in a world where \u201cwhen you play the game of thrones you win or you die\u201d\u00a0and being a woman is dangerous in itself, you have to look to the most manipulative kind. And Sansa isn\u2019t a warrior nor does she have supernatural powers, all she has to rely on is her mind or her body. When relying on her body, as Cersei, Margaery and Littlefinger would, failed - she had no choice but to rely solely on her mind again but play devious or offensive.\u00a0</p><p>And when she is finally in a position of power and she has been snubbed in Stark status because of her forced marriages to enemies, she looks to toning down her Tully side while still trying to evoke Catelyn <i>Stark</i>, Lady of Winterfell, but also playing more cautiously like Cersei.\u00a0She has to adapt and constantly change herself according to what the circumstances need her to be - but underneath it all, there is still that part of her that looks to her mother, her father and her childhood. A lot of the characters struggle with who they want to be and who they have to be to survive and Sansa is just one amongst all of them. \u00a0</p><p>The trouble is Sansa never really reveals what she wants at this point (\u201dWhat is it that you want? What do you want that you do not have?\u201d). She doesn\u2019t want anyone to know\u00a0because as Littlefinger says in the books \u201cWhen you know what a man wants, you know how to move him\u201d. Her unreadability is one of her strengths, but Littlefinger does know her insecurity that she used to trust too much\u00a0and he exploits that at every turn.\u00a0In the light of that ambiguity, people fill in the blanks as they wish, trying to twist a childish fantasy of wanting to be a queen by a handsome king\u2019s side into her wanting power. What Sansa truly wanted once was love and she wanted children too. The queen part was out of her <i>fairytale </i>fantasy.\u00a0</p><p>But life made her harden up and distrust more than she should <i>because </i>she was constantly made to believe her dreams were stupid and she trusted too much in the goodness of people. She also learnt that the only way to protect herself when she was considered a valuable pawn would be through a position of power.\u00a0This\u00a0dilemma of what she wants, what she has to be and what she fears informs her arc. She isn\u2019t as confident as she makes herself out to be. She constantly living in fear, which is carried over from years of living that way.\u00a0People often forget that, either because they think the place where Sansa is at is supposed to be completely idealised or they think she was rotten all along. <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/178075469777/the-lioness-the-dragon-queen-and-the-lady-wolf\" target=\"_blank\">Neither is true</a>. She\u2019s a work in progress, not a finished product.\u00a0</p><p>Frankly, she doesn\u2019t even think of any longterm desire except trying to stay alive.\u00a0The real question is\u00a0\u201cWho is Sansa beyond her never-ending fear?\u201d I don\u2019t think she herself knows or remembers anymore. But as the story comes to a close, she will have to think about it. She might\u2019ve had to use their tactics but she\u2019s not Cersei or Littlefinger. They\u2019re more of a cautionary tale to her anyway. She has to let people in again and trust them, trust that there are good people in the world and love doesn\u2019t make someone completely weak.\u00a0</p>",

Her modest clothing that has echoes of Cat contrasts her revealing Eyrie dress. She is completely covered up. Neither is she wearing a dress that mimics Littlefinger. Her dress is like Catelyn\u2019s but the colours are of House Stark.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"951\" data-orig-height=\"688\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b76c2abd96463b7b09d1dd402f6aa5a2/tumblr_inline_pfvl1sDo3h1u48vsz_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"951\" data-orig-height=\"688\"></figure><p>She goes with Brienne and even the direction of the scene is done such that Littlefinger is happy to see Sansa but Brienne enters after her and his face falls.

He does so by suggesting that she could barter Jaime for her daughters (when Arya isn\u2019t even there).\u00a0</p><p>Unlike Cat, in 6x05 Sansa tries to hold her ground and keep her emotions except disdain at bay. But he does shake a vein there by reminding her that Jon isn\u2019t her brother like Robb or Bran or Rickon; he\u2019s her half-brother. One that she was never close to and one that her mother distrusted. He does so while reminding her that the lords of the Vale remain loyal to her and Blackfish, her mother\u2019s uncle is someone she should look to.\u00a0</p><p>People that keep saying Sansa is \u201cstupid\u201d for constantly relying on Littlefinger after he betrays her, don\u2019t consider he fools Cat after she starts doubting him too and with Sansa, who is far more dependent on a protector to keep her safe and someone he essentially groomed as an abuser, he preys off her fears that she is alone even more. She\u2019s faced longterm abuse under different abusers but showwise, Littlefinger has been her abuser longer than anyone else. Unlike other abusers he also creates the impression that he cares about her in a way others can\u2019t. So after being stripped away from so much trust of goodness in the world, in love or god, she believes this terrible \u201clove\u201d is probably the best she\u2019ll ever get or that it\u2019s all she deserves.\u00a0<br></p><p>He tries to alienate her from Jon (and practically everyone else) so she can only depend on him, as he did with Brienne before. And considering the journey that Sansa has been through, she\u2019s been reminded time and again that she shouldn\u2019t trust anyone and been called foolish for doing so. Thus, even after she finally meets another Stark at last, she has to wonder if she really can trust him. She trusted her aunt Lysa and she tried to kill her. Littlefinger reminds her of her worst insecurities: that she\u2019s letting her guard down too much. He reminds her that she can\u2019t go back to being that little girl again. Hence that line \u201cNo one can protect me. No one can protect anyone\u201d later.\u00a0While I don\u2019t think she was right in doubting Jon, it\u2019s <i>understandable</i> considering the journey she went through and the number of people who have exploited her or tried to harm her.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"954\" data-orig-height=\"495\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4ab7ba7d6e6fe421351daea6953f78b/tumblr_inline_pfw6hi2Z0X1u48vsz_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"954\" data-orig-height=\"495\"></figure><p>She has moments when she wears her hair like her childhood Northern style after this. This is contextualised by her telling Brienne \u201c<i>Jon isn\u2019t Tormund. Jon isn\u2019t Davos or the Red Woman or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He\u2019s my brother.<i> </i>He\u2019ll keep me safe. <i><i>I trust him.</i></i></i>\u201d and Brienne points out that if she does, then why she lie to him about Blackfish when she knows he\u2019s not like the others. This scene shows that she <i>wants</i> to trust Jon, but Littlefinger hit a vein there and she\u2019s scared of putting that amount of trust in him.\u00a0<br></p><p>So from this moment onwards until the end of the Battle of the Bastards, Sansa continues wearing her mother\u2019s Tully braid as an armor that screams\u00a0\u201cback off\u201d to everyone than her use of it at the end of season 4, where she was attempting to use Cersei\u2019s and Margaery\u2019s tactics of seducing the enemy to survive.\u00a0However, as I\u2019ve said before Cat herself has a number of hairstyles apart from braids, i.e. semi-tied hair or buns. The nods to Lyanna are far more subtle because Sansa never met her and her statue isn\u2019t exactly very revealing of her appearance, but the elements that make their way into Sansa\u2019s look shows her Northernness. \u00a0</p><p>She uses aspects of Catelyn and Lyanna at different points by merging them with some aspect of Cersei or Margaery because in a world where \u201cwhen you play the game of thrones you win or you die\u201d\u00a0and being a woman is dangerous in itself, you have to look to the most manipulative kind. And Sansa isn\u2019t a warrior nor does she have supernatural powers, all she has to rely on is her mind or her body. When relying on her body, as Cersei, Margaery and Littlefinger would, failed - she had no choice but to rely solely on her mind again but play devious or offensive.\u00a0</p><p>And when she is finally in a position of power and she has been snubbed in Stark status because of her forced marriages to enemies, she looks to toning down her Tully side while still trying to evoke Catelyn <i>Stark</i>, Lady of Winterfell, but also playing more cautiously like Cersei.\u00a0She has to adapt and constantly change herself according to what the circumstances need her to be - but underneath it all, there is still that part of her that looks to her mother, her father and her childhood. A lot of the characters struggle with who they want to be and who they have to be to survive and Sansa is just one amongst all of them. \u00a0</p><p>The trouble is Sansa never really reveals what she wants at this point (\u201dWhat is it that you want? What do you want that you do not have?\u201d). She doesn\u2019t want anyone to know\u00a0because as Littlefinger says in the books \u201cWhen you know what a man wants, you know how to move him\u201d. Her unreadability is one of her strengths, but Littlefinger does know her insecurity that she used to trust too much\u00a0and he exploits that at every turn.\u00a0In the light of that ambiguity, people fill in the blanks as they wish, trying to twist a childish fantasy of wanting to be a queen by a handsome king\u2019s side into her wanting power. What Sansa truly wanted once was love and she wanted children too. The queen part was out of her <i>fairytale </i>fantasy.\u00a0</p><p>But life made her harden up and distrust more than she should <i>because </i>she was constantly made to believe her dreams were stupid and she trusted too much in the goodness of people. She also learnt that the only way to protect herself when she was considered a valuable pawn would be through a position of power.\u00a0This\u00a0dilemma of what she wants, what she has to be and what she fears informs her arc. She isn\u2019t as confident as she makes herself out to be. She constantly living in fear, which is carried over from years of living that way.\u00a0People often forget that, either because they think the place where Sansa is at is supposed to be completely idealised or they think she was rotten all along. <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/178075469777/the-lioness-the-dragon-queen-and-the-lady-wolf\" target=\"_blank\">Neither is true</a>. She\u2019s a work in progress, not a finished product.\u00a0</p><p>Frankly, she doesn\u2019t even think of any longterm desire except trying to stay alive.\u00a0The real question is\u00a0\u201cWho is Sansa beyond her never-ending fear?\u201d I don\u2019t think she herself knows or remembers anymore. But as the story comes to a close, she will have to think about it. She might\u2019ve had to use their tactics but she\u2019s not Cersei or Littlefinger. They\u2019re more of a cautionary tale to her anyway. She has to let people in again and trust them, trust that there are good people in the world and love doesn\u2019t make someone completely weak.\u00a0</p>",

The nods to Lyanna are far more subtle because Sansa never met her and her statue isn\u2019t exactly very revealing of her appearance, but the elements that make their way into Sansa\u2019s look shows her Northernness. \u00a0</p><p>She uses aspects of Catelyn and Lyanna at different points by merging them with some aspect of Cersei or Margaery because in a world where \u201cwhen you play the game of thrones you win or you die\u201d\u00a0and being a woman is dangerous in itself, you have to look to the most manipulative kind. And Sansa isn\u2019t a warrior nor does she have supernatural powers, all she has to rely on is her mind or her body. When relying on her body, as Cersei, Margaery and Littlefinger would, failed - she had no choice but to rely solely on her mind again but play devious or offensive.\u00a0</p><p>And when she is finally in a position of power and she has been snubbed in Stark status because of her forced marriages to enemies, she looks to toning down her Tully side while still trying to evoke Catelyn <i>Stark</i>, Lady of Winterfell, but also playing more cautiously like Cersei.\u00a0She has to adapt and constantly change herself according to what the circumstances need her to be - but underneath it all, there is still that part of her that looks to her mother, her father and her childhood. A lot of the characters struggle with who they want to be and who they have to be to survive and Sansa is just one amongst all of them. \u00a0</p><p>The trouble is Sansa never really reveals what she wants at this point (\u201dWhat is it that you want?

Her unreadability is one of her strengths, but Littlefinger does know her insecurity that she used to trust too much\u00a0and he exploits that at every turn.\u00a0In the light of that ambiguity, people fill in the blanks as they wish, trying to twist a childish fantasy of wanting to be a queen by a handsome king\u2019s side into her wanting power. What Sansa truly wanted once was love and she wanted children too. The queen part was out of her <i>fairytale </i>fantasy.\u00a0</p><p>But life made her harden up and distrust more than she should <i>because </i>she was constantly made to believe her dreams were stupid and she trusted too much in the goodness of people.

People really do overemphasise Sansa&rsquo;s season 7 hairstyle&rsquo;s connection Cersei.
