The office she managed was just a five minute drive from his house, so he was in almost daily. Although at first she thought he was dropping in because he wanted to micromanage her, she knew better now.</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s a great place to raise a family,\u201d he said, rubbing at the front of his coat. \u201cSafe, great weather, good schools. The whole package.

She didn\u2019t care, but it was polite conversation. She ripped off her robe and started rooting in her bureau for a bra when she heard a soft exhalation. Walt stared at her from her from the threshold, his face a rictus of desire.</p><hr><p><b>December 23</b></p><p>\u201cOh, go on. It\u2019ll be fun,\u201d Venessa said, poking at her side. She already had too much, but she was working on another glass of wine. \u201cI know there\u2019s several people here you want to touch inappropriately.\u201d Nessa\u2019s eyes narrowed conspiratorially.</p><p>Walt stood nearby, holding up the wall and nursing a beer. He looked back and forth between the women, following the conversation. Kathryn walked up, devastating in a hunter green velvet strapless dress. Her hair was pulled up and her makeup was flawless, but her lips were pinched into a perpetual bitchface.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Venessa,\u201d she said, putting her arm around her waist. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of men to go around.\u201d She gave Walt a pointed glance.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, being all heteronormative,\u201d Vanessa said, taking a healthy sip of wine.</p><p>\u201cYou make a good point. The bottle stops where it stops. It shouldn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a woman or a man,\u201d Katty said, raising her brow. \u201cI myself have kissed a girl or two, and I liked it.\u201d</p><p>One of Nessa\u2019s co-workers, a loud, oversexed 20-something man with slicked back hair and an ugly Christmas sweater hooted and waved around his beer. \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, chief. Any minutes in the closet with a mouthbreathing nerd is hardly heavenly,\u201d Katty said. He wilted. Vanessa snorted. Walt was walking to the kitchen for another beer when she yelled out to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you slink off, Walt. You\u2019re playing too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He wore a terrible, over-tinseled sweater that Orvis decorated and Katty made him wear. A santa hat drooped on his head.</p><p>She stared at him, eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat, are you too good to socialize with the underlings?\u201d she said, waving her arm magnanimously at the small crowd in their basement. He winced and grabbed her arm, guiding her to a corner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. Mostly, it\u2019s because it would break at least 20 different local and federal labor laws,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh shut it,\u201d she said, pushing him away. \u201cHaven\u2019t you watched television lately? You\u2019re just a chicken.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed. \u201cChicken?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are we, 12? It\u2019s not a good idea, Katty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great idea,\u201d she said loudly and broke from his grip. She wrapped her arm around another acquaintance, a young junior accountant named Megan and squeezed. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bottle?\u201d She eyed the young redhead rapaciously.</p><p>He sidled up next to her, his jaw working. She didn\u2019t know why, but she wanted to touch him. His shoulder. His twitching jaw. His tinseled chest. Kathryn\u2019s presence felt like a naked, too-bright lightbulb. It was headache inducing, and she wondered how he dealt with her all the time. She was beautiful, but what did it matter if you couldn\u2019t even look her in the eye?</p><p>\u201cSpin the bottle. That\u2019s nostalgic,\u201d she said, taking a sip of her wine.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure,\u201d he said. He drained his beer. He looked her up and down. \u201cWhere\u2019s Toto?\u201d he said, pointing at her glittery red shoes.</p><p>\u201cHa ha ha,\u201d she said, smirking. \u201cThat\u2019s not one I\u2019ve heard a million times.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHave you made a wish yet?\u201d he said, warming up. \u201cYou just have to click your heels, Dorothy.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI wish the merriment was over already, how about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he said frankly, and sighed. There was silence, and leaned against the wall. Beyond the smell of booze and hors d\u2019oeuvres, she could smell him. She took a deep breath. It was so unlikely for a man dressed as a parody of Elf on a Shelf to smell so deliciously masculine.</p><p>\u201cWe could escape. You can wish it with your special shoes,\u201d he said, and winked at her.</p><p>\u201cLay off my bitchin\u2019 holiday style choices already. In any case, maybe you could-\u201d she pointed at his outfit -\u201dwhat mythical powers does the elf have, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any. He lives in fear of the almighty power of Santa, and lives at the mercy of her whims,\u201d he said. He chuckled, but it was dry. They fell quiet again as they watched people gather around the glass coffee table. An empty syrah bottle sat on its side in the middle.</p><p>Kathryn clapped to get everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAlright, this is the way it\u2019s gonna go,\u201d she said, sitting on Venessa\u2019s lap. \u201cWe\u2019ve written down different acts and dropped them in this adorable holiday themed wine glass-\u201d She shook it and smiled. \u201cThere will be two spins to make it really random.

It shouldn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a woman or a man,\u201d Katty said, raising her brow. \u201cI myself have kissed a girl or two, and I liked it.\u201d</p><p>One of Nessa\u2019s co-workers, a loud, oversexed 20-something man with slicked back hair and an ugly Christmas sweater hooted and waved around his beer. \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, chief. Any minutes in the closet with a mouthbreathing nerd is hardly heavenly,\u201d Katty said. He wilted. Vanessa snorted. Walt was walking to the kitchen for another beer when she yelled out to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you slink off, Walt. You\u2019re playing too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He wore a terrible, over-tinseled sweater that Orvis decorated and Katty made him wear. A santa hat drooped on his head.</p><p>She stared at him, eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat, are you too good to socialize with the underlings?\u201d she said, waving her arm magnanimously at the small crowd in their basement. He winced and grabbed her arm, guiding her to a corner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. Mostly, it\u2019s because it would break at least 20 different local and federal labor laws,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh shut it,\u201d she said, pushing him away. \u201cHaven\u2019t you watched television lately? You\u2019re just a chicken.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed. \u201cChicken?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are we, 12? It\u2019s not a good idea, Katty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great idea,\u201d she said loudly and broke from his grip. She wrapped her arm around another acquaintance, a young junior accountant named Megan and squeezed. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bottle?\u201d She eyed the young redhead rapaciously.</p><p>He sidled up next to her, his jaw working. She didn\u2019t know why, but she wanted to touch him. His shoulder. His twitching jaw. His tinseled chest. Kathryn\u2019s presence felt like a naked, too-bright lightbulb. It was headache inducing, and she wondered how he dealt with her all the time. She was beautiful, but what did it matter if you couldn\u2019t even look her in the eye?</p><p>\u201cSpin the bottle. That\u2019s nostalgic,\u201d she said, taking a sip of her wine.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure,\u201d he said. He drained his beer. He looked her up and down. \u201cWhere\u2019s Toto?\u201d he said, pointing at her glittery red shoes.</p><p>\u201cHa ha ha,\u201d she said, smirking. \u201cThat\u2019s not one I\u2019ve heard a million times.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHave you made a wish yet?\u201d he said, warming up. \u201cYou just have to click your heels, Dorothy.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI wish the merriment was over already, how about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he said frankly, and sighed. There was silence, and leaned against the wall. Beyond the smell of booze and hors d\u2019oeuvres, she could smell him. She took a deep breath. It was so unlikely for a man dressed as a parody of Elf on a Shelf to smell so deliciously masculine.</p><p>\u201cWe could escape. You can wish it with your special shoes,\u201d he said, and winked at her.</p><p>\u201cLay off my bitchin\u2019 holiday style choices already. In any case, maybe you could-\u201d she pointed at his outfit -\u201dwhat mythical powers does the elf have, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any. He lives in fear of the almighty power of Santa, and lives at the mercy of her whims,\u201d he said. He chuckled, but it was dry. They fell quiet again as they watched people gather around the glass coffee table. An empty syrah bottle sat on its side in the middle.</p><p>Kathryn clapped to get everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAlright, this is the way it\u2019s gonna go,\u201d she said, sitting on Venessa\u2019s lap. \u201cWe\u2019ve written down different acts and dropped them in this adorable holiday themed wine glass-\u201d She shook it and smiled. \u201cThere will be two spins to make it really random. First for person one, and second for person two, you get it.\u201d People whispered with excitement.</p><hr><p><b>Want more?

She groaned and swatted at herself. She was gonna smell like a booze factory. &ldquo;Jesus, who is it? It&rsquo;s after 11pm-&rdquo; She yanked the door open, and Walt stood on her porch, hands deep in the pockets of his wool coat.</p><p>&ldquo;Walt?&rdquo; she said, still wiping at herself. His eyes traveled from her flushed face and down her body. She suddenly remembered she was wearing only a robe. She wrapped her arms around herself and cleared her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; he said, then stepped into her kitchen before she could balk. She closed the door behind her and sighed. She knew it might happen. She felt it would, and she wasn&rsquo;t sure whether she was pleased or not.</p><p>He looked at her counter, where white wine dripped from the red stone to the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Having a nightcap, eh?&rdquo; he said, and gave her a crooked grin.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she said, then started to clean aggressively &ndash; she needed to do something with her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I was, um &ndash; I was just having a quick closing meeting with Venessa,&rdquo; he gesticulated awkwardly. &ldquo;The office is just around the way. Odd you&rsquo;d choose to continue working so far away,&rdquo; he said, smiling again. &ldquo;Nessa lives near me &ndash; in fact, just a few miles away. We were discussing that if you were both open to it, I could just pull an ol&rsquo; switcheroo-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said quickly as she squeezed the dishrag into the sink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as easy as that. I have my people there. We work well together. Just pulling up roots and leaving would be weird.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; His smile faded, and he finally took his hands out of his pockets. &ldquo;It was just an idea. To make things easier for both of you.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave him a sidelong look. &ldquo;You live in Stockton,&rdquo; she said. The office she managed was just a five minute drive from his house, so he was in almost daily. Although at first she thought he was dropping in because he wanted to micromanage her, she knew better now.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep. It&rsquo;s a great place to raise a family,&rdquo; he said, rubbing at the front of his coat. &ldquo;Safe, great weather, good schools. The whole package. Katty loves it-&rdquo; he gasped, as if trying to swallow the last words back.</p><p>That bitch doesn&rsquo;t love anything, she said underneath her breath as she walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;How is Kathryn?&rdquo; she said as she walked into her bedroom to put on clothes. She didn&rsquo;t care, but it was polite conversation. She ripped off her robe and started rooting in her bureau for a bra when she heard a soft exhalation. Walt stared at her from her from the threshold, his face a rictus of desire.</p><hr /><p><b>December 23</b></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, go on. It&rsquo;ll be fun,&rdquo; Venessa said, poking at her side. She already had too much, but she was working on another glass of wine. &ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s several people here you want to touch inappropriately.&rdquo; Nessa&rsquo;s eyes narrowed conspiratorially.</p><p>Walt stood nearby, holding up the wall and nursing a beer. He looked back and forth between the women, following the conversation. Kathryn walked up, devastating in a hunter green velvet strapless dress. Her hair was pulled up and her makeup was flawless, but her lips were pinched into a perpetual bitchface.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Venessa,&rdquo; she said, putting her arm around her waist. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a lot of men to go around.&rdquo; She gave Walt a pointed glance.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at you, being all heteronormative,&rdquo; Vanessa said, taking a healthy sip of wine.</p><p>&ldquo;You make a good point.

Any minutes in the closet with a mouthbreathing nerd is hardly heavenly,&rdquo; Katty said. He wilted. Vanessa snorted.
