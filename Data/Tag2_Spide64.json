You look up and meet Tony\u2019s eyes filled with his own sorrow, you quickly wipe away the tears that stained your cheek with your sleeve before looking back at Tony with the toughest expression you could pull right now. But he saw right through everything<br/></p><p>\u201cH-he&rsquo;s not dead is-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay\u201d \u00a0He cuts you off, knowing neither of you wanted to think about that right now. You press your lips together and shut your eyes, a few tears slipping out. \u201cI need to see him\u201d you move around Tony quickly before he could stop you. Entering the room you see Peter sitting up on the bed awake, but with multiple tubes running into him, bandages wrapped around him and bruises on his face and body. His chest raised and fell slowly, he sat up eyebrows furrowing when he saw you enter the room.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d you whimpered putting your hand over your mouth to keep sobs from escaping, it hurt like hell seeing him like this. He was strong you knew that, but he still needed to be helped, held, and loved, he was only a kid he shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this crap but he refused to give it up, \u2018someone has to look out for the little guy\u2019 he would say. You wanted nothing more than to run over to him, hold him in your arms tightly and cry telling him how much of an idiot he was, but he looked at you carefully and differently causing your stomach to turn making you feel sick.</p><p>He stared at you, no fear in his eyes but he stayed like that staring at you and he opened his mouth to say something before Tony trudged into the room. He turned his head quickly looking at Tony while you still stared at Peter feeling sick to your stomach, you knew your Peter.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, whos that?\u201d he asked glancing at you quickly</p><p>Your heart plummeted down to your stomach, your throat closing up, you wanted to break down and cry at the spot. You look over at Tony, glaring at him you breathed heavily trying to keep yourself from crying. Tony looked at you with sorrowful eyes biting the inside of his cheek, he turned looking at Peter \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back kid\u201d Peter nodded sitting back, Tony motioned for you to follow him and walked out of the room. Slowly walking over to the door you looked at Peter mournfully, giving him a small smile to which he returned before you walked out of the room with tears already streaming down your face with no intent of stopping.</p><p>\u201cI-I just\u201d you choked trying to form a sentence, but even you didn\u2019t know what you were trying to say. Everything was wrong, every part of your body was in pain aching for the touch of the one you loved.</p><p>Tony looked at you with those same clouded mournful eyes, he placed a hand on your shoulder letting out a sigh. \u201cHe got a severe hit to the head during his- during the accident\u2026 and it causes some memory loss..\u201d</p><p>You look up at him, salty tears covering your face you grit your teeth together trying not to break down in front of him. He shakes his head opening his arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold back kid, come here\u201d you instantly nod letting out a sob as you crashed into his chest, staining his expensive dress shirt in your cold tears. He wraps his arms around you, stroking your hair soothingly. \u201cI know it hurts\u2026\u201d</p><p>Your whole body shook from the sobs and the pure exhaustion, you opened your eyes after a while and looked up at him. \u201cCan I fix it? Tell me I can fix it?\u201d your voice cracked, Tony shut his eyes at the sound of your voice making his heart sting. \u201cThere is something we can do\u2026\u201d </p><p>If there was even a small chance that there was something you could do to fix it, you would do it. Whatever it takes to have Peter back in your arms&hellip;to have him back to you</p><p>***</p><p>Peter watched Tony walk out of the room with the unknown girl behind him, she looked as if she was in pain? She looked at him with desperate broken eyes but smiled slightly at him, though he didn\u2019t know who she was or where he even was, he gave her a grin back.</p><p>The door closed and he quickly started looking around the room, where am I? What happened? Is May okay? And who was that girl?</p><p>He raised an eyebrow hearing some sounds from the opposite side of the door, if Tony was here then he had to be okay. Letting out a small sigh he sank down into the bed, sitting up quickly when he heard the door open and saw Tony and the girl walk in.</p><p>Tony stood at the foot of the bed, placing a hand on Peters leg and looking at him with strained and worried eyes. All while the girl stared at the floor</p><p>\u201cYou alright Kid?\u201d Peter quickly looks away from the girl looking at Tony</p><p>\u201cYeah, Im a- just a bit confused\u201d Peter furrowed his eyebrows letting out a light chuckle, ignoring the pain that shot up his side. \u201cUnderstandable, I uh- wanted to introduce you to someone quickly\u201d Tony looked at girl, tilting his head slightly motioning towards Peter</p><p>The girl finally looked up from the ground, biting her lip she walked over to him stretching her hand out for a handshake. \u201cMy name is Y/n\u201d</p><p>\u201cIm Peter, but you already knew that.. sorry\u201d he chuckled nervously, shook her hand and smiled at the pretty girl in front of him</p><p>***</p><p>You helped Tony out around the tower mostly by helping him take care of Peter. You didn\u2019t talk to him much, mostly cause you were to scared to do anything, you lost him once and that was already too much, you couldn\u2019t bare to lose him again.</p><p>But you both exchanged smiles when he talked to you, when he complimented your hair and blushed looking down, or when he tricked you into holding his hand. \u201cY/n.. I\u2019m scared of needles.. can you um..\u201d he looks down and blushes slightly, \u201cCan you hold my hand?\u201d he looks up at you with puppy eyes and almost whines</p><p>\u201cUh..\u201d you set the tray of medication down and look up to still see Peter giving you his puppy eyes. \u201cSure Pete\u201d you walk over to him and take his hand as he gets the shot, he looks down and smiles cheekily to himself as he squeezes your hand. You look at him and notice his smile, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>After a week or so of helping with Peter it was decided that he was well enough to go back to school, it took a lot of convincing to finally make Tony give in and let him out of bed.</p><p>You were so swept away by Peter as you spent almost everyday with me, falling in love with him all over again. Lost in your own head that you forgot of all the memories that you lost with him.</p><p>You stood outside of the school waiting, where you and Peter used to meet before school, next to the birch tree that he used to call \u2018Our Tree\u2019</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until you stood there for nearly 20 minutes that you realized he wasn\u2019t coming, because you lost him, it hit you hard all over again. \u201cGod Im so stupid\u201d you groaned, you felt so stupid for being so in your own head</p><p>This is real life</p><p>Reality</p><p>It hurt..but at least you still had Peter..</p><p>You look at the tree and sighed turning around to walk away before stopping in your tracks when you saw Peter standing there with a shy smile and flowers in hand. \u201cBut you- how did you..know to meet me here? Your memory?\u201d you stuttered looking at him with wide eyes</p><p> \u201cUh..yeah, I uh- got my memory back the morning of the day you helped me with my shot and I asked you to hold my hand\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how to tell you..\u201d he smiled at you innocently,</p><p>\u201cGod damn it Peter! Y-you I was so scared! Don\u2019t do that, I thought I lost you forever!\u201d you almost started crying as he pulled you into his chest and kissed the top of your head, hugging you tightly \u201cIm sorry.. I love you so much Im sorry\u201d you shake your head letting out a choked sob before looking up at him with watery eyes, \u201cI could kill you right now Parker\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence why I brought you flowers, to uh..soften the blow?\u201d</p><p>You chuckle lightly, shaking your head you pull him closer and kiss him softly, \u201cI love you so much\u201d he smiled against your lips and wrapped his arms around you. \u201cI love you too\u201d he mumbled and handed you the flowers, \u201cBlow softened? Did the flowers work?\u201d he asked grinning at you</p><p>You look at him and take the flowers carefully, \u201cShut up\u2026\u201d you smile and kiss him again, that\u2019s your Peter</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><b>Let me know what you thought?</b></p><p><b><b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXlc3-1WrNaHGp_jf_3rx2w\">@sataninsatin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn6FlkxLKDBOl3GgNLgSxPw\">@tomhollanduniverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@laureharrier</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNjjGr9BWwpwkogw1tsn48A\">@bilkyrie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlwy1zQGX8v0frk4LDIIm9g\">@suncitydanvers</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miU0H-oXt1yBac7EgtHk6Tg\">@missrobyn81</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mepOI37RkCAiPUcutLcvaPQ\">@veeshthefrog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU4ekY6rT14R8-FUWruBF3g\">@crazylittlewitch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnv8Ml0VciZlh8u4wnJe19A\">@hollandechart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfYQpjtTlzRjZ1yGBhP6cHw\">@spiderman-n</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1Wlhir1zWc8iVpq1tMM4IA\">@avenirectioner</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_L08i7caegOXnQ7xtnIosQ\">@ofserien</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAUoKt4RJF-nbqpQs5f84VA\">@alex&ndash;awesome&ndash;22</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRiG8xMF48jIpZ8fWrtL8yA\">@softscottlang</a>\u00a0 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOWx55aDqElM1MmP63JGuQ\">@hollandroos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVyQp_CiykgvDau8sBewk0g\">@the-unicorn-store</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU27l16GxD3qD8rZ_4B1uRg\">@panicatmybrain</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM1g0y87bULbEl0X7Linrcw\">@toms-order</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQzBoK5r98yvoz04k0QblyQ\">@fantasyandfallacies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj1IGMu9snWMj2mWJhYAf3A\">@cherryblossomcharlotte</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7f9Vj4MQeo_T_EnZWpJJYA\">@lovelyspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEiguZRZmiCoP57LFk81VsQ\">@petalparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNZCW3HyTkMK3lf01FSI9hg\">@gennyld</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjbQW72kZ_2h7Xkea8QtyWA\">@iaiabear</a>\u00a0</b></b></p>",

He was strong you knew that, but he still needed to be helped, held, and loved, he was only a kid he shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this crap but he refused to give it up, \u2018someone has to look out for the little guy\u2019 he would say. You wanted nothing more than to run over to him, hold him in your arms tightly and cry telling him how much of an idiot he was, but he looked at you carefully and differently causing your stomach to turn making you feel sick.</p><p>He stared at you, no fear in his eyes but he stayed like that staring at you and he opened his mouth to say something before Tony trudged into the room. He turned his head quickly looking at Tony while you still stared at Peter feeling sick to your stomach, you knew your Peter.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, whos that?\u201d he asked glancing at you quickly</p><p>Your heart plummeted down to your stomach, your throat closing up, you wanted to break down and cry at the spot. You look over at Tony, glaring at him you breathed heavily trying to keep yourself from crying. Tony looked at you with sorrowful eyes biting the inside of his cheek, he turned looking at Peter \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back kid\u201d Peter nodded sitting back, Tony motioned for you to follow him and walked out of the room.

Entering the room you see Peter sitting up on the bed awake, but with multiple tubes running into him, bandages wrapped around him and bruises on his face and body. His chest raised and fell slowly, he sat up eyebrows furrowing when he saw you enter the room.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cPeter?\u201d you whimpered putting your hand over your mouth to keep sobs from escaping, it hurt like hell seeing him like this. He was strong you knew that, but he still needed to be helped, held, and loved, he was only a kid he shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this crap but he refused to give it up, \u2018someone has to look out for the little guy\u2019 he would say. You wanted nothing more than to run over to him, hold him in your arms tightly and cry telling him how much of an idiot he was, but he looked at you carefully and differently causing your stomach to turn making you feel sick.</p><p>He stared at you, no fear in his eyes but he stayed like that staring at you and he opened his mouth to say something before Tony trudged into the room. He turned his head quickly looking at Tony while you still stared at Peter feeling sick to your stomach, you knew your Peter.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, whos that?\u201d he asked glancing at you quickly</p><p>Your heart plummeted down to your stomach, your throat closing up, you wanted to break down and cry at the spot. You look over at Tony, glaring at him you breathed heavily trying to keep yourself from crying. Tony looked at you with sorrowful eyes biting the inside of his cheek, he turned looking at Peter \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back kid\u201d Peter nodded sitting back, Tony motioned for you to follow him and walked out of the room. Slowly walking over to the door you looked at Peter mournfully, giving him a small smile to which he returned before you walked out of the room with tears already streaming down your face with no intent of stopping.</p><p>\u201cI-I just\u201d you choked trying to form a sentence, but even you didn\u2019t know what you were trying to say. Everything was wrong, every part of your body was in pain aching for the touch of the one you loved.</p><p>Tony looked at you with those same clouded mournful eyes, he placed a hand on your shoulder letting out a sigh. \u201cHe got a severe hit to the head during his- during the accident\u2026 and it causes some memory loss..\u201d</p><p>You look up at him, salty tears covering your face you grit your teeth together trying not to break down in front of him. He shakes his head opening his arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold back kid, come here\u201d you instantly nod letting out a sob as you crashed into his chest, staining his expensive dress shirt in your cold tears. He wraps his arms around you, stroking your hair soothingly. \u201cI know it hurts\u2026\u201d</p><p>Your whole body shook from the sobs and the pure exhaustion, you opened your eyes after a while and looked up at him. \u201cCan I fix it? Tell me I can fix it?\u201d your voice cracked, Tony shut his eyes at the sound of your voice making his heart sting. \u201cThere is something we can do\u2026\u201d </p><p>If there was even a small chance that there was something you could do to fix it, you would do it. Whatever it takes to have Peter back in your arms\u2026to have him back to you</p><p>***</p><p>Peter watched Tony walk out of the room with the unknown girl behind him, she looked as if she was in pain? She looked at him with desperate broken eyes but smiled slightly at him, though he didn\u2019t know who she was or where he even was, he gave her a grin back.</p><p>The door closed and he quickly started looking around the room, where am I? What happened? Is May okay? And who was that girl?</p><p>He raised an eyebrow hearing some sounds from the opposite side of the door, if Tony was here then he had to be okay. Letting out a small sigh he sank down into the bed, sitting up quickly when he heard the door open and saw Tony and the girl walk in.</p><p>Tony stood at the foot of the bed, placing a hand on Peters leg and looking at him with strained and worried eyes. All while the girl stared at the floor</p><p>\u201cYou alright Kid?\u201d Peter quickly looks away from the girl looking at Tony</p><p>\u201cYeah, Im a- just a bit confused\u201d Peter furrowed his eyebrows letting out a light chuckle, ignoring the pain that shot up his side. \u201cUnderstandable, I uh- wanted to introduce you to someone quickly\u201d Tony looked at girl, tilting his head slightly motioning towards Peter</p><p>The girl finally looked up from the ground, biting her lip she walked over to him stretching her hand out for a handshake. \u201cMy name is Y/n\u201d</p><p>\u201cIm Peter, but you already knew that.. sorry\u201d he chuckled nervously, shook her hand and smiled at the pretty girl in front of him</p><p>***</p><p>You helped Tony out around the tower mostly by helping him take care of Peter. You didn\u2019t talk to him much, mostly cause you were to scared to do anything, you lost him once and that was already too much, you couldn\u2019t bare to lose him again.</p><p>But you both exchanged smiles when he talked to you, when he complimented your hair and blushed looking down, or when he tricked you into holding his hand. \u201cY/n.. I\u2019m scared of needles.. can you um..\u201d he looks down and blushes slightly, \u201cCan you hold my hand?\u201d he looks up at you with puppy eyes and almost whines</p><p>\u201cUh..\u201d you set the tray of medication down and look up to still see Peter giving you his puppy eyes. \u201cSure Pete\u201d you walk over to him and take his hand as he gets the shot, he looks down and smiles cheekily to himself as he squeezes your hand. You look at him and notice his smile, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>After a week or so of helping with Peter it was decided that he was well enough to go back to school, it took a lot of convincing to finally make Tony give in and let him out of bed.</p><p>You were so swept away by Peter as you spent almost everyday with me, falling in love with him all over again. Lost in your own head that you forgot of all the memories that you lost with him.</p><p>You stood outside of the school waiting, where you and Peter used to meet before school, next to the birch tree that he used to call \u2018Our Tree\u2019</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until you stood there for nearly 20 minutes that you realized he wasn\u2019t coming, because you lost him, it hit you hard all over again. \u201cGod Im so stupid\u201d you groaned, you felt so stupid for being so in your own head</p><p>This is real life</p><p>Reality</p><p>It hurt..but at least you still had Peter..</p><p>You look at the tree and sighed turning around to walk away before stopping in your tracks when you saw Peter standing there with a shy smile and flowers in hand. \u201cBut you- how did you..know to meet me here? Your memory?\u201d you stuttered looking at him with wide eyes</p><p> \u201cUh..yeah, I uh- got my memory back the morning of the day you helped me with my shot and I asked you to hold my hand\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how to tell you..\u201d he smiled at you innocently,</p><p>\u201cGod damn it Peter! Y-you I was so scared! Don\u2019t do that, I thought I lost you forever!\u201d you almost started crying as he pulled you into his chest and kissed the top of your head, hugging you tightly \u201cIm sorry.. I love you so much Im sorry\u201d you shake your head letting out a choked sob before looking up at him with watery eyes, \u201cI could kill you right now Parker\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence why I brought you flowers, to uh..soften the blow?\u201d</p><p>You chuckle lightly, shaking your head you pull him closer and kiss him softly, \u201cI love you so much\u201d he smiled against your lips and wrapped his arms around you. \u201cI love you too\u201d he mumbled and handed you the flowers, \u201cBlow softened? Did the flowers work?\u201d he asked grinning at you</p><p>You look at him and take the flowers carefully, \u201cShut up\u2026\u201d you smile and kiss him again, that\u2019s your Peter</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><b>Let me know what you thought?</b></p><p><b><b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXlc3-1WrNaHGp_jf_3rx2w\">@sataninsatin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn6FlkxLKDBOl3GgNLgSxPw\">@tomhollanduniverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@laureharrier</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNjjGr9BWwpwkogw1tsn48A\">@bilkyrie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlwy1zQGX8v0frk4LDIIm9g\">@suncitydanvers</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miU0H-oXt1yBac7EgtHk6Tg\">@missrobyn81</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mepOI37RkCAiPUcutLcvaPQ\">@veeshthefrog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU4ekY6rT14R8-FUWruBF3g\">@crazylittlewitch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnv8Ml0VciZlh8u4wnJe19A\">@hollandechart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfYQpjtTlzRjZ1yGBhP6cHw\">@spiderman-n</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1Wlhir1zWc8iVpq1tMM4IA\">@avenirectioner</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_L08i7caegOXnQ7xtnIosQ\">@ofserien</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAUoKt4RJF-nbqpQs5f84VA\">@alex\u2013awesome\u201322</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRiG8xMF48jIpZ8fWrtL8yA\">@softscottlang</a>\u00a0 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOWx55aDqElM1MmP63JGuQ\">@hollandroos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVyQp_CiykgvDau8sBewk0g\">@the-unicorn-store</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU27l16GxD3qD8rZ_4B1uRg\">@panicatmybrain</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM1g0y87bULbEl0X7Linrcw\">@toms-order</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQzBoK5r98yvoz04k0QblyQ\">@fantasyandfallacies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj1IGMu9snWMj2mWJhYAf3A\">@cherryblossomcharlotte</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7f9Vj4MQeo_T_EnZWpJJYA\">@lovelyspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEiguZRZmiCoP57LFk81VsQ\">@petalparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNZCW3HyTkMK3lf01FSI9hg\">@gennyld</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjbQW72kZ_2h7Xkea8QtyWA\">@iaiabear</a>\u00a0</b></b></p>",
