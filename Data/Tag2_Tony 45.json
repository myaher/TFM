If I focus on one of those, drawing it out from the very air while also adjusting its state&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes fluttered a little. A bubble of liquid slowly appeared between his hands, steadily growing from nothing. As it formed, waves of vapor swirled around it, trickling down his fingers to the floor. Stephen watched, mystified.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ta daah,&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes crinkled with delight. &ldquo;Liquid nitrogen. And here&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>The nitrogen vanished, evaporating back into the air. Tony plucked up a nearby pencil, holding it up for emphasis.</p><p>&ldquo;This happens to be a pure graphite pencil. Someone here&rsquo;s got some standards, I dunno, but it&rsquo;s definitely not me&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen snickered into his fist. His cheeks were flushed, a dopey grin on his face. Tony swallowed thickly. Now was a bad time to get distracted.</p><p>&ldquo;Graphite is made of carbon, yes?&rdquo; The sorcerer continued. &ldquo;So if I borrow the carbon in the pencil and some kinetic energy, using magic to boost the output and also apply some ambient heat&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Tony crushed the pencil between his hands, pressing as firmly as he could. His palms glowed, bright and hot, before abiding. He pulled his hand back and, when the wood and metal and rubber burned away, he was left with a tiny diamond in his palm. Stephen gasped, maybe a little too dramatically, and held the diamond between his thumb and index finger.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s incredible,&rdquo; He gushed, holding it up to the light. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really fascinating how well thought out your sorcery is. I assumed it&rsquo;s more&hellip; Raw and emotional, but you&rsquo;ve really just reduced it to good ol&rsquo; scientific methods and analytics.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It just makes more sense that way.&rdquo; Tony shrugged, leaning back against a desk.</p><p>They stood there in companionable silence, the Sanctum&rsquo;s backdrop rather cozy and familiar. Out the corner of his eye, he watched Tony, taking in his relaxed body language, his open smile, his warmth and companionable attitude. He was different here, surrounded by magic, living in it. Something in him seemed calmer. Stephen wondered if he was the same back in his weapons design days, just as relaxed surrounded by missile casings and gunpowder.</p><p>&ldquo;Watcha thinkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; Tony spoke up, his voice soft.</p><p>Stephen inhaled slowly, holding it in his lungs until it burned.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; About how I&rsquo;ll need at least another one of these,&rdquo; He held up his nearly empty beer bottle, smiling. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re gonna show me some more mind-melting magic stuffs.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony winked and the bottle refilled itself, earning a huff and a grin in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Easy peasy, doc.&rdquo;</p></p>",

I wouldn&rsquo;t\nhave time to do my studies and to get a job. Like, a paid job. I don&rsquo;t want to\nlive with aunt May forever and keep draining her income to take care of me.

He took a deep breath\nbefore lifting his eyes off the ground and to the other man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I was\npracticing some cool new flips and swings and I accidentally undershot how far\naway a building was.

Bullied? Peter Parker? It didn&rsquo;t seem\npossible, but the boy in front of him refused to meet his eyes, and Tony knew\nhe wasn&rsquo;t lying this time. He gently set Peter&rsquo;s arm down by his side, then\ngrabbed his keys off his desk. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Come\non, kid, we&rsquo;re going to get this fixed, and don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m paying for\nit.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony\nset a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder, steering him carefully out of the room and\ntowards the garage. Peter didn&rsquo;t even protest, just relaxing under the man&rsquo;s\nhand and allowing himself to be led. Tony couldn&rsquo;t imagine the pain he was in,\nor how he could go this long without breaking down even a little bit. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;As\nsoon as we get in the car, I&rsquo;ll call aunt May and let her know what&rsquo;s\ngoing-&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No!&ldquo;\nPeter cried, eyes wide and frantic as he turned to the other man. &quot;Mr.\nStark, please, don&rsquo;t tell her about the other kids. I don&rsquo;t want to worry her.\nPlease, Mr. Stark.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One\nlook in Peter&rsquo;s large, doe eyes, and Tony gave a sigh, caving easily. It was\nhard to say no to the boy, and he wondered how in the world the other kids had\nthe heart to push him down the stairs. &ldquo;Alright, alright, I won&rsquo;t tell her\nabout the other kids. But I&rsquo;m still going to tell her that your arm is broken.\nShe has a right to know.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter\nnodded, giving that soft, almost gummy smile that Tony liked to see before he\nwinced, rubbing over his arm lightly. Tony pulled the boy close to his side,\nhooking an arm over his shoulder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Okay,\ntough guy, let&rsquo;s go get you patched up.&ldquo; </p>",

Why can&rsquo;t we just forget\nabout it?&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"If\nit wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal, why didn&rsquo;t you go to the hospital and get it\nfixed up? Peter, it can&rsquo;t fix itself like this! It needs to be in a cast.&rdquo;\n</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Some\nkid pushed me down the stairs at school, okay?&ldquo; Peter interrupted, his\nface bright red, though with anger or embarrassment, Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure.\n\"He&rsquo;s been picking on me for a few weeks now, and he pushed me down the\nstairs and I broke my arm but I didn&rsquo;t want to tell anyone because then they&rsquo;ll\njust laugh at me and I just want to make it through the last month without any\nissues.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony\nwas shocked, his mouth hanging open. Bullied? Peter Parker? It didn&rsquo;t seem\npossible, but the boy in front of him refused to meet his eyes, and Tony knew\nhe wasn&rsquo;t lying this time. He gently set Peter&rsquo;s arm down by his side, then\ngrabbed his keys off his desk. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Come\non, kid, we&rsquo;re going to get this fixed, and don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m paying for\nit.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony\nset a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder, steering him carefully out of the room and\ntowards the garage. Peter didn&rsquo;t even protest, just relaxing under the man&rsquo;s\nhand and allowing himself to be led. Tony couldn&rsquo;t imagine the pain he was in,\nor how he could go this long without breaking down even a little bit. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"As\nsoon as we get in the car, I&rsquo;ll call aunt May and let her know what&rsquo;s\ngoing-&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"No!&ldquo;\nPeter cried, eyes wide and frantic as he turned to the other man. \"Mr.\nStark, please, don&rsquo;t tell her about the other kids. I don&rsquo;t want to worry her.\nPlease, Mr. Stark.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One\nlook in Peter&rsquo;s large, doe eyes, and Tony gave a sigh, caving easily. It was\nhard to say no to the boy, and he wondered how in the world the other kids had\nthe heart to push him down the stairs. &ldquo;Alright, alright, I won&rsquo;t tell her\nabout the other kids. But I&rsquo;m still going to tell her that your arm is broken.\nShe has a right to know.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter\nnodded, giving that soft, almost gummy smile that Tony liked to see before he\nwinced, rubbing over his arm lightly. Tony pulled the boy close to his side,\nhooking an arm over his shoulder. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Okay,\ntough guy, let&rsquo;s go get you patched up.&ldquo; </p>",
