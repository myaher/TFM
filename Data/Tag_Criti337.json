Champ, that creep, is working the desk when they get\nback but thankfully keeps his comments to himself when they pay for two rooms\nbut all file into one.</p><p>Keg is sketching out vague blueprints of the Sour Nest with\nNila&rsquo;s help, Caleb is still recovering from talking for ten whole minutes back\nat the Estate Sybaritic, and Nott is naturally glued to his side while he flips\nvacantly through his spellbook. Aside from the occasional whispers, none of\nthem speak. Beau, meanwhile, can barely focus on anything. The room, already\ncramped with the five of them packed into it, feels almost claustrophobically\nsmall. Every sound, from Keg\u2019s whispering to the scratching of quill against\npaper, feels like it\u2019s being carved into her eardrums with a chisel. So with as\nlittle movement as possible Beau stands, throws her cloak over one arm, and\nsteps out of the room. A quick glance over her shoulder shows her that Nott is\nthe only one to notice her departure. She watches Beau walk out, but doesn&rsquo;t\nacknowledge her with anything more than a barely-there nod of the head. <br/></p><p>It&rsquo;s probably shitty of her, to be walking off alone after\neverything that&rsquo;s happened and while there\u2019s still so much to do, but\u00a0if\nshe doesn\u2019t get a breath of fresh air and thirty seconds of silence she is\ngoing to crawl out of her fucking<b> </b><i>skin</i>. Hopefully the obvious presence of\nher pack left behind conveys that this is just a stroll; that she\u2019ll be\ncareful, that she fully intends to come back.</p><p>Like intent means <i>anything</i>\nthese days.</p><p>She sniffs, wiping her nose on the sleeve of her cloak as\nshe puts it on in the foyer. The cold weather has been vicious on her sinuses,\nused as she is to the southern climes of Kamordah and Zadash. Or at least,\nthat&rsquo;s what she tells herself to keep her face stern as she walks through Shady\nCreek.</p><p>This place is an absolute disaster, and Beau has seen some\nterrible shithole towns and some seedy goddamn underbellies. There\u2019s more than\na few people passed out or straight-up dead in the gutter, garbage and food\nrefuse is scattered everywhere, and the whole place smells vaguely of blood and\ndry rot. It does very little to alleviate her mood, and briefly she wonders if\nshe\u2019s going to feel like this - discontented, like she pulled a muscle in her\nsoul - forever, if this is just her life now. No. That\u2019s bullshit. She\u2019s been\nthrough hell before and come out swinging; she can do it again this time. She\ndoesn\u2019t know when she\u2019s gonna come out the other side, but she will. At least\nshe\u2019s not alone this go-round.</p><p>She walks a few blocks, but the sights don\u2019t get any less\ndepressing or disheartening. She doesn\u2019t feel quite as penned-in as before, but\nnow that her head is clearer the jagged, rusty edges of the town loom even\nsharper. With every step she\u2019s further and further convinced that this little\nwalk was a mistake, but something keeps her putting one foot in front of the\nother. It feels less like she\u2019s running away and more like she\u2019s walking <i>towards</i> something, which makes no\nfucking sense but feeling like she has some sort of goal is leagues better and she\u2019ll\nchase that feeling anywhere.</p><p>Eventually her feet lead her to a small stone building, set\napart from the others. It\u2019s somewhere between a shed and hut in size, made of\nbrick in places and large unworked stones in others, painted a uniform grey. Despite\nhow ramshackle it is, it doesn\u2019t carry the same air that the rest of the\nbuildings in town do. There\u2019s something about it that makes the hairs on the\nback of her neck stand up.</p><p>One step closer becomes two, becomes five, and she sees the\nmetal raven skull set into the door, the bundles of dried flowers set at the\ndoorstep and that feeling suddenly makes sense. This is a temple. The Matron of\nRavens is an interesting choice to have in the middle of town, but not\nnecessarily odd. </p><p>It takes her a second, however, to realize it&rsquo;s not a temple\nto the Matron of Ravens. Painted copper coins have been nailed around the\ndoorframe, which Beau only notices when she gets closer, showing that this small\nbuilding is dedicated to her Champion instead. The coins are precisely spaced,\nand not a single one is missing, surprisingly. Huh. Apparently there are some\nthings in Shady Creek that are sacred. Or maybe it\u2019s fear of divine reprisal,\nbut either works. Still, that\u2019s a motif that people only use when praying to\nhim, rather than his queen.</p><p>Beau knows the folktales, and her connections with the Cobalt\nSoul means she knows which ones are true. She&rsquo;s heard all about the Champion of\nthe Lost, the guardian of souls, the knight who sits at the Matron\u2019s right\nhand. While she holds total dominion over death, it is his charge to see the\nsouls of the deceased safely to her embrace. He comforts the recently dead, and\nprevents them from becoming restless, haunted spirits. Beyond that the\ninformation is fuzzy, protected by the higher echelons of the order. She knows how\nhe used to be a mortal servant of the Lady of Fates a couple decades ago, but\nthat\u2019s about it. She doesn\u2019t know when people started worshipping him or why, but\nthere seems to be some substance to it, at least. If nothing answered the\nprayers, people probably wouldn\u2019t pray anymore. Given who he serves, worship of\nhim isn\u2019t prohibited in the Empire, per se, but it\u2019s not exactly the safest of\npropositions to have a temple exclusively dedicated to him like this one.</p><p>It makes sense, in a weird sort of way. Town like this,\nthere\u2019s probably a lot of people who want to make sure their souls aren\u2019t left\nto wander.</p><p>Pushing the door open to the tinkling of chimes, Beau pokes\nher head in. There\u2019s no one else in the space, so she steps in and shuts the\ndoor behind her. The temple is clean, with a couple of low benches and a small,\nif well appointed, altar. While there isn\u2019t a whole lot of ambient light to\ncome in through the windows in the first place, what does come through is\nfiltered by gauzy curtains, creating a sense of dusk.</p><p>The temple smells of dry stone, smoke, and lavender. Off against\nthe wall she can see a black iron censer and the low glow of the coals inside\nit. It\u2019s such a small thing, but that gentle herbal scent reminds her so\nprofoundly of Molly that she cracks for the second time in three days,\nstumbling before the small altar and falling to her knees to cry. The slender\nstatue of a half-elven man with great black wings looks quietly down as the\npain bleeds out of her.</p><p>Was he there, when Molly passed? The stories said he could\nfly faster than thought, was he quick enough that Molly didn\u2019t wake up\nsomewhere alone <i>again</i>?</p><p>She\u2019s not exactly sure how much time passes, but it\u2019s not\ntoo long before her tears have run their course and she pulls herself up to sit\nheavily on the bench nearest the altar. </p><p>\u201cListen up, you asshole,\u201d she says, pointing an indignant\nfinger at the statue. The figure of the Champion is carved from stone and\npainted with an almost loving amount of detail. \u201cYou look after him, alright? We\u2019re\ngonna do our damndest to get him back, but you make sure to keep him company\nfor now. He\u2019s obnoxious, but he\u2019s one of the good ones. One of the few really\ngood ones.\u201d</p><p>Praying has never been one of her strong suits-she\u2019d never\nreally needed it before the monastery, and the Cobalt Soul was more interested\nin serving Ioun in deeds than venerating her at all hours. \u00a0Maybe calling him an asshole wasn\u2019t the\ngreatest idea, but it\u2019s all she has. The statue is smiling-smirking, more like-so\nhe\u2019s probably the sort of entity to take that kind of talk in stride.</p><p>She sets her face in her hands, sighing. \u201cTell him we miss\nhim,\u201d she says, voice muffled.</p><p>There\u2019s no one else in the temple-she checked when she\nwalked in, and the chimes hung from the door have stayed silent, but she feels\nsomeone sit down beside her and put an arm over her shoulders. She catches a\nwaft of that rich incense Molly was so fond of, and hears, behind her, the\nfaint sound of creaking leather armor.</p><p>The feeling is gone as quickly as it comes, and Beau lets\nout a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. Suddenly the small temple feels\nbarren and unwelcoming. She\u2019s had her moment of quiet, and now the thought of\nthat cramped room is an appealing one. She doesn\u2019t want to be alone now.</p><p>She takes some of her last pocket bacon and sets them in the\noffering dish at the foot of the statue for the Champion. The dead don\u2019t need food,\nand the gods need it even less, but it feels right. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says, and stalls at the door for a moment or\nso, unsure if there\u2019s anything she\u2019s supposed to be doing, before simply walking\naway.</p><p>She makes her way back through the streets of Shady Creek\nRun with a keen eye on her surroundings. The only thing she misses is the large\nblack bird that flies behind her, keeping watch the whole way.</p>",

Aside from the occasional whispers, none of\nthem speak. Beau, meanwhile, can barely focus on anything. The room, already\ncramped with the five of them packed into it, feels almost claustrophobically\nsmall. Every sound, from Keg\u2019s whispering to the scratching of quill against\npaper, feels like it\u2019s being carved into her eardrums with a chisel. So with as\nlittle movement as possible Beau stands, throws her cloak over one arm, and\nsteps out of the room. A quick glance over her shoulder shows her that Nott is\nthe only one to notice her departure.

The cold weather has been vicious on her sinuses,\nused as she is to the southern climes of Kamordah and Zadash. Or at least,\nthat\u2019s what she tells herself to keep her face stern as she walks through Shady\nCreek.</p><p>This place is an absolute disaster, and Beau has seen some\nterrible shithole towns and some seedy goddamn underbellies. There\u2019s more than\na few people passed out or straight-up dead in the gutter, garbage and food\nrefuse is scattered everywhere, and the whole place smells vaguely of blood and\ndry rot. It does very little to alleviate her mood, and briefly she wonders if\nshe\u2019s going to feel like this - discontented, like she pulled a muscle in her\nsoul - forever, if this is just her life now. No. That\u2019s bullshit. She\u2019s been\nthrough hell before and come out swinging; she can do it again this time. She\ndoesn\u2019t know when she\u2019s gonna come out the other side, but she will. At least\nshe\u2019s not alone this go-round.</p><p>She walks a few blocks, but the sights don\u2019t get any less\ndepressing or disheartening. She doesn\u2019t feel quite as penned-in as before, but\nnow that her head is clearer the jagged, rusty edges of the town loom even\nsharper. With every step she\u2019s further and further convinced that this little\nwalk was a mistake, but something keeps her putting one foot in front of the\nother. It feels less like she\u2019s running away and more like she\u2019s walking <i>towards</i> something, which makes no\nfucking sense but feeling like she has some sort of goal is leagues better and she\u2019ll\nchase that feeling anywhere.</p><p>Eventually her feet lead her to a small stone building, set\napart from the others. It\u2019s somewhere between a shed and hut in size, made of\nbrick in places and large unworked stones in others, painted a uniform grey. Despite\nhow ramshackle it is, it doesn\u2019t carry the same air that the rest of the\nbuildings in town do. There\u2019s something about it that makes the hairs on the\nback of her neck stand up.</p><p>One step closer becomes two, becomes five, and she sees the\nmetal raven skull set into the door, the bundles of dried flowers set at the\ndoorstep and that feeling suddenly makes sense. This is a temple. The Matron of\nRavens is an interesting choice to have in the middle of town, but not\nnecessarily odd. </p><p>It takes her a second, however, to realize it\u2019s not a temple\nto the Matron of Ravens. Painted copper coins have been nailed around the\ndoorframe, which Beau only notices when she gets closer, showing that this small\nbuilding is dedicated to her Champion instead. The coins are precisely spaced,\nand not a single one is missing, surprisingly. Huh. Apparently there are some\nthings in Shady Creek that are sacred. Or maybe it\u2019s fear of divine reprisal,\nbut either works. Still, that\u2019s a motif that people only use when praying to\nhim, rather than his queen.</p><p>Beau knows the folktales, and her connections with the Cobalt\nSoul means she knows which ones are true. She\u2019s heard all about the Champion of\nthe Lost, the guardian of souls, the knight who sits at the Matron\u2019s right\nhand. While she holds total dominion over death, it is his charge to see the\nsouls of the deceased safely to her embrace. He comforts the recently dead, and\nprevents them from becoming restless, haunted spirits. Beyond that the\ninformation is fuzzy, protected by the higher echelons of the order. She knows how\nhe used to be a mortal servant of the Lady of Fates a couple decades ago, but\nthat\u2019s about it. She doesn\u2019t know when people started worshipping him or why, but\nthere seems to be some substance to it, at least. If nothing answered the\nprayers, people probably wouldn\u2019t pray anymore. Given who he serves, worship of\nhim isn\u2019t prohibited in the Empire, per se, but it\u2019s not exactly the safest of\npropositions to have a temple exclusively dedicated to him like this one.</p><p>It makes sense, in a weird sort of way. Town like this,\nthere\u2019s probably a lot of people who want to make sure their souls aren\u2019t left\nto wander.</p><p>Pushing the door open to the tinkling of chimes, Beau pokes\nher head in. There\u2019s no one else in the space, so she steps in and shuts the\ndoor behind her. The temple is clean, with a couple of low benches and a small,\nif well appointed, altar. While there isn\u2019t a whole lot of ambient light to\ncome in through the windows in the first place, what does come through is\nfiltered by gauzy curtains, creating a sense of dusk.</p><p>The temple smells of dry stone, smoke, and lavender. Off against\nthe wall she can see a black iron censer and the low glow of the coals inside\nit. It\u2019s such a small thing, but that gentle herbal scent reminds her so\nprofoundly of Molly that she cracks for the second time in three days,\nstumbling before the small altar and falling to her knees to cry. The slender\nstatue of a half-elven man with great black wings looks quietly down as the\npain bleeds out of her.</p><p>Was he there, when Molly passed? The stories said he could\nfly faster than thought, was he quick enough that Molly didn\u2019t wake up\nsomewhere alone <i>again</i>?</p><p>She\u2019s not exactly sure how much time passes, but it\u2019s not\ntoo long before her tears have run their course and she pulls herself up to sit\nheavily on the bench nearest the altar. </p><p>\u201cListen up, you asshole,\u201d she says, pointing an indignant\nfinger at the statue. The figure of the Champion is carved from stone and\npainted with an almost loving amount of detail. \u201cYou look after him, alright? We\u2019re\ngonna do our damndest to get him back, but you make sure to keep him company\nfor now. He\u2019s obnoxious, but he\u2019s one of the good ones. One of the few really\ngood ones.\u201d</p><p>Praying has never been one of her strong suits-she\u2019d never\nreally needed it before the monastery, and the Cobalt Soul was more interested\nin serving Ioun in deeds than venerating her at all hours. \u00a0Maybe calling him an asshole wasn\u2019t the\ngreatest idea, but it\u2019s all she has. The statue is smiling-smirking, more like-so\nhe\u2019s probably the sort of entity to take that kind of talk in stride.</p><p>She sets her face in her hands, sighing. \u201cTell him we miss\nhim,\u201d she says, voice muffled.</p><p>There\u2019s no one else in the temple-she checked when she\nwalked in, and the chimes hung from the door have stayed silent, but she feels\nsomeone sit down beside her and put an arm over her shoulders. She catches a\nwaft of that rich incense Molly was so fond of, and hears, behind her, the\nfaint sound of creaking leather armor.</p><p>The feeling is gone as quickly as it comes, and Beau lets\nout a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. Suddenly the small temple feels\nbarren and unwelcoming. She\u2019s had her moment of quiet, and now the thought of\nthat cramped room is an appealing one. She doesn\u2019t want to be alone now.</p><p>She takes some of her last pocket bacon and sets them in the\noffering dish at the foot of the statue for the Champion. The dead don\u2019t need food,\nand the gods need it even less, but it feels right. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says, and stalls at the door for a moment or\nso, unsure if there\u2019s anything she\u2019s supposed to be doing, before simply walking\naway.</p><p>She makes her way back through the streets of Shady Creek\nRun with a keen eye on her surroundings. The only thing she misses is the large\nblack bird that flies behind her, keeping watch the whole way.</p>",
