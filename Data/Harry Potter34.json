Depending on your state of mind, you&rsquo;d either lie motionless, staring at the canopy for hours, or thrash fitfully until passing out near dawn from the sheer exertion of trying. You&rsquo;d sleepwalk through the following day, quiet and irritable, desperate to climb out of your own head, falling deeper into it every time you remembered there was no one to whom you could turn with your feelings.</p><p>Your behaviour hadn&rsquo;t gone unnoticed by your family and friends. James had muttered on more than one occasion that you were turning into Sirius, which <i>certainly</i> did not help. Remus, ever your protector, had tried so many times to talk to you, most recently that very afternoon.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s something wrong. You <b>know</b> I know there&rsquo;s something wrong, so why won&rsquo;t you just tell me? I&rsquo;m your best friend.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The look of hurt that passed over his delicate face broke you in two. Merlin knew you <b>wanted</b> to tell him. You were having to dig your fingernails into your thigh, in fact, to keep from just launching yourself into his arms, sobbing into his shoulder, and telling him everything. It would make it all so much easier to bear&hellip; but only for you. Because yes, Remus would stroke your hair, and rock you, and tell you everything was going to be all right, and you knew beyond the shadow of a doubt he&rsquo;d keep your secret. But then it would change <b>his</b> behaviour, even if only subconsciously. And the boys were too in tune with one other, especially these days. They&rsquo;d notice, they&rsquo;d demand he tell them what was going on, and he&rsquo;d find himself in the same position you were in now. You wouldn&rsquo;t wish that misery on him for anything.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Remus, do you trust me?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He nodded, but sadly, already knowing what was coming next.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you said, giving him the most convincing smile you could muster. You knew from the look on his face that you hadn&rsquo;t mustered much at all. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing I can&rsquo;t handle, all right? And nothing I want you dwelling on. I&rsquo;ll work it out.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Technically, it would have been easier to unburden yourself to Lily, but you didn&rsquo;t see a light at the end of <i>that</i> tunnel, either. She&rsquo;d never be anything other than supportive, but Lily was a fixer. And considering how much she hated Sirius and your brother, her preferred fix would most likely be to try to talk you out of the whole thing altogether. Then again, maybe you should just let her. As the universe&rsquo;s cruel jokes went, having you fall in&hellip; whatever this was you were in with Sirius Black had to be up there on the list. </p><p>It certainly hadn&rsquo;t been a conscious effort. In fact, you were entirely baffled as to how it had happened at all, which contributed significantly to your inner turmoil. One minute, you&rsquo;d been roaming the halls of Hogwarts with your brother and his friends, giggling and trodding on one another underneath the invisibility cloak, popping in and out of secret passages, and celebrating in the Gryffindor common room after pulling off another epic prank. The next, Peter was behaving more and more oddly every day, Remus&rsquo;s transformations combined with the changes his body was undergoing had him in a terrible state, James was either failing miserably at wooing Lily or taking out his frustrations on Severus Snape with little else in between, and Sirius had turned quiet, sullen, and moody. And you&hellip; you&rsquo;d woken up one day, walked into the Great Hall for breakfast, and felt your stomach drop into your feet when he glanced up at you.</p><p>You&rsquo;d been exhausting yourself for months trying to reason your way out of it, telling yourself it was just a reaction you were having to his situation. You and Sirius had always been close in that you could open up to one another about the darker aspects of your personalities in ways you couldn&rsquo;t with the others. You both had short fuses and more-destructive-than-average tendencies and devious streaks that frequently tilted more toward reckless abandon than calculated risk, and you were both more than a little afraid of those traits. It was easier &ndash; safer &ndash; to work that out between yourselves. Because of that, you knew quite a bit about Sirius&rsquo;s home life, whereas James, Remus, and Peter knew only what Sirius deemed necessary. You knew what had flipped a switch on Sirius&rsquo;s typically overbearing-yet-affable demeanor was nothing short of pure evil. These&hellip; feelings were nothing more than your desire to help and protect him manifesting oddly. So what if you felt like the breath had been knocked out of you every time he was within five feet of you, if a shiver went down your spine every time he said your name, if your nerves went haywire every time he touched you. Your friend was drowning, and he wouldn&rsquo;t let you throw him a line &ndash; said it was &ldquo;too dangerous now&rdquo; and he didn&rsquo;t want you involved. The rest of this idiocy was just a side effect of your feelings of helplessness.</p><p>And now, he was living in your house. Right down the hall.</p><p>He&rsquo;d finally escaped, and you couldn&rsquo;t have been more thrilled, more relieved. When he&rsquo;d arrived at Potter Manor, you&rsquo;d flung your arms around him freely, crying softly into the crook of his neck as he gently rubbed your back and assured you that everything was going to be just fine from now on. You didn&rsquo;t feel anything in that moment but the pure, overwhelming affection for your friend you&rsquo;d felt ever since the day you met him. Foolishly, you thought that would be the end of it. He was safe now. No more need to lie awake at night worrying about what might be happening to him at Grimmauld Place. No more feeling useless. No more feeling frightened. No more <i>feeling</i>. </p><p>But you&rsquo;d been wrong. Whatever it was &ndash; and it was <i>not</i> love, you reminded yourself repeatedly; you knew enough of that concept to know it was supposed to be all googly eyes and hearts skipping beats and butterflies, not this abject terror you were experiencing &ndash; it was persistent. And you&rsquo;d found yourself simply avoiding him, and, by default, the other boys, while you tried to sort yourself out. It wasn&rsquo;t proving to be a very productive plan of action thus far, but it was all you had.</p><p>Sighing, you rolled out of bed, resolved to head to the family library. If you had to be awake, you could at least try to otherwise occupy your mind.</p><p>As you made your way down the corridor, faint music caught your attention. Following it, you recognised the band. You listened for a moment more before coming to a halt. You knew where the music would be coming from, and your head told you the last thing you needed right now was to be confronted with the very problem that had you out of bed and wandering the manor at this hour in the first place. Your heart, however, seemed to have other ideas &ndash; and had apparently commandeered your feet, as you suddenly found yourself moving toward the sound once again.</p><p>Silently, you turned the knob and cracked the door to Sirius&rsquo;s room. It was dark, but the moonlight spilling in through the window cast sufficient glow. He was seated on the floor, back against the foot of his bed, turntable beside him. He hadn&rsquo;t changed clothes, still clad in the jeans and Queen t-shirt he&rsquo;d worn that day. As &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Get Enough&rdquo; continued to play, he examined the tracklisting on the back of the album, one with which you were familiar. You&rsquo;d bought it yourself just a week before, and you&rsquo;d been excited to get home and play it for him. You knew he&rsquo;d love it. Instead, he&rsquo;d smiled at you, and you&rsquo;d excused yourself to your room for the rest of the day, only partially feigning illness.</p><p>Tears pricked your eyes, and you carefully, soundlessly turned the knob again in order to pull the door back into place.</p><p>&ldquo;You can hear it better from in here, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>You jumped, slamming the door loudly in the process.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit!!&rdquo;</p><p><i>I swear, he&rsquo;s got the wrong Animagus form. Should&rsquo;ve been a bloody bat or something.</i></p><p>Embarrassed at being caught, you grappled with the thought of fleeing back to your room, but that would look even stranger than spying on him. Besides, if he thought all you were trying to do was hear the music, there was no reason to be standing here in the hallway, blushing like a complete idiot. Taking a deep breath, you opened the door.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a right foul mouth on you these days,&rdquo; Sirius chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Wonder where I could&rsquo;ve gotten that from.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a perfect angel, just ask your mum.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked up at you, pulling a wide-eyed, innocent face. You forced a laugh to accompany the quickly exhaled breath that fled your lungs. The moonlight cascaded across his face, highlighting his handsome features, lending an unearthly shimmer to his dark hair.</p><p><i>An angel. That&rsquo;s <b>exactly</b> what he looks like.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sleep again?&rdquo; he asked, turning the music down a bit. </p><p>You shook your head, moving to take a seat on the floor opposite him. Instead, he patted the space beside him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see the liner notes from there,&rdquo; he reasoned. You couldn&rsquo;t seem to feel your legs, but you were grateful when they somehow lowered you onto the spot he indicated rather than dropping you like a wet rag onto the turntable.</p><p>Sirius held the album where you could see it, unaware you were already familiar with every track.</p><p>&ldquo;Bad Company. Brand new. I&rsquo;m into it. There&rsquo;s a tune on here I swear was written specifically about the Marauders,&rdquo; he grinned.</p><p>You knew to which song he referred. The title track. Trade &ldquo;gun&rdquo; for &ldquo;wand&rdquo;, and it would be just about spot on. You managed a smile as the opening notes of &ldquo;Rock Steady&rdquo;, your favourite track, began.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a great one as well,&rdquo; Sirius said, turning the volume back up before settling against the end of his bed. &ldquo;Lean back,&rdquo; he instructed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll clear your head, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Sirius had pulled his blankets down to cushion the bed frame, and you pressed yourself into them.</p><p><i>Close my eyes, and I let myself go<br/>Listen to, oh, baby, let the music flow</i></p><p>Slowly, your eyelids drooped as you allowed the music to wash over you. It had been impossible lately to focus. Stress, confliction, fear &ndash; they&rsquo;d all combined to keep your mind swirling constantly, making you feel out of place and confused. At night, with nothing to distract you, it was worse. You felt like you were living multiple lives all at once. But now, with a newly loved song surrounding you as warmly as the soft blankets behind your back, you were nowhere but here.</p><p>With him.</p><p>You opened your eyes and turned your head to find Sirius staring at you. Inhaling sharply, your body tried to react &ndash; to look away. You needed to look away. But you felt pinned to the spot by his gaze. In the moonlight, his grey eyes were nearly silver, and you felt the sensation of falling into them. You wanted to fight it but found yourself lacking the strength. You realised you weren&rsquo;t breathing. A part of you didn&rsquo;t care. The thought of the pain of the last several months just melting away to nothing seemed incredibly appealing. And he would be the last thing you ever saw.</p><p><i>Turn on your light<br/>And stay with me awhile<br/>And ease your worried mind<br/>Turn on your light<br/>And stay with me awhile</i></p><p>You took a slow breath, suddenly wanting to live again.</p><p>Numb as you were, you barely felt it when Sirius&rsquo;s arm slipped around your waist, drawing you against his side. You exhaled. You felt miles above your body when your head dropped of its own volition onto his shoulder. You plummeted back down into yourself at the sensation of his cheek coming to rest on your forehead. He reached over with his free hand and gently took yours, slowly interlacing your fingers. You inhaled. He smelled like the cedar trees around the Black Lake after a storm. And firewhisky and tobacco and&hellip;</p><p><i>Vice.</i></p><p>A truth at once comforting and terrifying dawned on you: You had never wanted anything more than you wanted to remain in this moment, always&hellip; to let time and space and fate crumble around you unnoticed. The burning, tingling pressure in your chest you&rsquo;d been trying to will away for weeks now finally broke through your barriers, but not as the despairing flood you&rsquo;d expected; instead, as a slow seep into every empty corner of your being. A completion.</p><p><i>Please&hellip; oh, please no&hellip; it can&rsquo;t be&hellip;</i></p><p>For all the world&rsquo;s romantic fairy tales, surely love could not be as simple as a tinderbox boy and a paperdoll girl, broken in the same hidden places, trying to hold one another together to the pulsing rhythm of a dirty guitar.</p><p><i>But it is&hellip;</i></p><p>The answer echoed through your mind as the song ended and a new one began, and you both slipped silently into sleep.</p>",

In fact, you were entirely baffled as to how it had happened at all, which contributed significantly to your inner turmoil. One minute, you\u2019d been roaming the halls of Hogwarts with your brother and his friends, giggling and trodding on one another underneath the invisibility cloak, popping in and out of secret passages, and celebrating in the Gryffindor common room after pulling off another epic prank. The next, Peter was behaving more and more oddly every day, Remus\u2019s transformations combined with the changes his body was undergoing had him in a terrible state, James was either failing miserably at wooing Lily or taking out his frustrations on Severus Snape with little else in between, and Sirius had turned quiet, sullen, and moody. And you\u2026 you\u2019d woken up one day, walked into the Great Hall for breakfast, and felt your stomach drop into your feet when he glanced up at you.</p><p>You\u2019d been exhausting yourself for months trying to reason your way out of it, telling yourself it was just a reaction you were having to his situation. You and Sirius had always been close in that you could open up to one another about the darker aspects of your personalities in ways you couldn\u2019t with the others. You both had short fuses and more-destructive-than-average tendencies and devious streaks that frequently tilted more toward reckless abandon than calculated risk, and you were both more than a little afraid of those traits. It was easier \u2013 safer \u2013 to work that out between yourselves. Because of that, you knew quite a bit about Sirius\u2019s home life, whereas James, Remus, and Peter knew only what Sirius deemed necessary. You knew what had flipped a switch on Sirius\u2019s typically overbearing-yet-affable demeanor was nothing short of pure evil. These\u2026 feelings were nothing more than your desire to help and protect him manifesting oddly. So what if you felt like the breath had been knocked out of you every time he was within five feet of you, if a shiver went down your spine every time he said your name, if your nerves went haywire every time he touched you. Your friend was drowning, and he wouldn\u2019t let you throw him a line \u2013 said it was \u201ctoo dangerous now\u201d and he didn\u2019t want you involved. The rest of this idiocy was just a side effect of your feelings of helplessness.</p><p>And now, he was living in your house. Right down the hall.</p><p>He\u2019d finally escaped, and you couldn\u2019t have been more thrilled, more relieved. When he\u2019d arrived at Potter Manor, you\u2019d flung your arms around him freely, crying softly into the crook of his neck as he gently rubbed your back and assured you that everything was going to be just fine from now on. You didn\u2019t feel anything in that moment but the pure, overwhelming affection for your friend you\u2019d felt ever since the day you met him. Foolishly, you thought that would be the end of it. He was safe now. No more need to lie awake at night worrying about what might be happening to him at Grimmauld Place. No more feeling useless. No more feeling frightened. No more <i>feeling</i>. </p><p>But you\u2019d been wrong. Whatever it was \u2013 and it was <i>not</i> love, you reminded yourself repeatedly; you knew enough of that concept to know it was supposed to be all googly eyes and hearts skipping beats and butterflies, not this abject terror you were experiencing \u2013 it was persistent. And you\u2019d found yourself simply avoiding him, and, by default, the other boys, while you tried to sort yourself out. It wasn\u2019t proving to be a very productive plan of action thus far, but it was all you had.</p><p>Sighing, you rolled out of bed, resolved to head to the family library. If you had to be awake, you could at least try to otherwise occupy your mind.</p><p>As you made your way down the corridor, faint music caught your attention. Following it, you recognised the band. You listened for a moment more before coming to a halt. You knew where the music would be coming from, and your head told you the last thing you needed right now was to be confronted with the very problem that had you out of bed and wandering the manor at this hour in the first place. Your heart, however, seemed to have other ideas \u2013 and had apparently commandeered your feet, as you suddenly found yourself moving toward the sound once again.</p><p>Silently, you turned the knob and cracked the door to Sirius\u2019s room. It was dark, but the moonlight spilling in through the window cast sufficient glow. He was seated on the floor, back against the foot of his bed, turntable beside him. He hadn\u2019t changed clothes, still clad in the jeans and Queen t-shirt he\u2019d worn that day. As \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough\u201d continued to play, he examined the tracklisting on the back of the album, one with which you were familiar. You\u2019d bought it yourself just a week before, and you\u2019d been excited to get home and play it for him. You knew he\u2019d love it. Instead, he\u2019d smiled at you, and you\u2019d excused yourself to your room for the rest of the day, only partially feigning illness.</p><p>Tears pricked your eyes, and you carefully, soundlessly turned the knob again in order to pull the door back into place.</p><p>\u201cYou can hear it better from in here, you know.\u201d</p><p>You jumped, slamming the door loudly in the process.</p><p>\u201cShit!!\u201d</p><p><i>I swear, he\u2019s got the wrong Animagus form. Should\u2019ve been a bloody bat or something.</i></p><p>Embarrassed at being caught, you grappled with the thought of fleeing back to your room, but that would look even stranger than spying on him. Besides, if he thought all you were trying to do was hear the music, there was no reason to be standing here in the hallway, blushing like a complete idiot. Taking a deep breath, you opened the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a right foul mouth on you these days,\u201d Sirius chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWonder where I could\u2019ve gotten that from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a perfect angel, just ask your mum.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at you, pulling a wide-eyed, innocent face. You forced a laugh to accompany the quickly exhaled breath that fled your lungs. The moonlight cascaded across his face, highlighting his handsome features, lending an unearthly shimmer to his dark hair.</p><p><i>An angel. That\u2019s <b>exactly</b> what he looks like.</i></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep again?\u201d he asked, turning the music down a bit. </p><p>You shook your head, moving to take a seat on the floor opposite him. Instead, he patted the space beside him. \u201cCan\u2019t see the liner notes from there,\u201d he reasoned. You couldn\u2019t seem to feel your legs, but you were grateful when they somehow lowered you onto the spot he indicated rather than dropping you like a wet rag onto the turntable.</p><p>Sirius held the album where you could see it, unaware you were already familiar with every track.</p><p>\u201cBad Company. Brand new. I\u2019m into it. There\u2019s a tune on here I swear was written specifically about the Marauders,\u201d he grinned.</p><p>You knew to which song he referred. The title track. Trade \u201cgun\u201d for \u201cwand\u201d, and it would be just about spot on. You managed a smile as the opening notes of \u201cRock Steady\u201d, your favourite track, began.</p><p>\u201cThis is a great one as well,\u201d Sirius said, turning the volume back up before settling against the end of his bed. \u201cLean back,\u201d he instructed. \u201cIt\u2019ll clear your head, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Sirius had pulled his blankets down to cushion the bed frame, and you pressed yourself into them.</p><p><i>Close my eyes, and I let myself go<br>Listen to, oh, baby, let the music flow</i></p><p>Slowly, your eyelids drooped as you allowed the music to wash over you. It had been impossible lately to focus. Stress, confliction, fear \u2013 they\u2019d all combined to keep your mind swirling constantly, making you feel out of place and confused. At night, with nothing to distract you, it was worse. You felt like you were living multiple lives all at once. But now, with a newly loved song surrounding you as warmly as the soft blankets behind your back, you were nowhere but here.</p><p>With him.</p><p>You opened your eyes and turned your head to find Sirius staring at you. Inhaling sharply, your body tried to react \u2013 to look away. You needed to look away. But you felt pinned to the spot by his gaze. In the moonlight, his grey eyes were nearly silver, and you felt the sensation of falling into them. You wanted to fight it but found yourself lacking the strength. You realised you weren\u2019t breathing. A part of you didn\u2019t care. The thought of the pain of the last several months just melting away to nothing seemed incredibly appealing. And he would be the last thing you ever saw.</p><p><i>Turn on your light<br>And stay with me awhile<br>And ease your worried mind<br>Turn on your light<br>And stay with me awhile</i></p><p>You took a slow breath, suddenly wanting to live again.</p><p>Numb as you were, you barely felt it when Sirius\u2019s arm slipped around your waist, drawing you against his side. You exhaled. You felt miles above your body when your head dropped of its own volition onto his shoulder. You plummeted back down into yourself at the sensation of his cheek coming to rest on your forehead. He reached over with his free hand and gently took yours, slowly interlacing your fingers. You inhaled. He smelled like the cedar trees around the Black Lake after a storm. And firewhisky and tobacco and\u2026</p><p><i>Vice.</i></p><p>A truth at once comforting and terrifying dawned on you: You had never wanted anything more than you wanted to remain in this moment, always\u2026 to let time and space and fate crumble around you unnoticed. The burning, tingling pressure in your chest you\u2019d been trying to will away for weeks now finally broke through your barriers, but not as the despairing flood you\u2019d expected; instead, as a slow seep into every empty corner of your being. A completion.</p><p><i>Please\u2026 oh, please no\u2026 it can\u2019t be\u2026</i></p><p>For all the world\u2019s romantic fairy tales, surely love could not be as simple as a tinderbox boy and a paperdoll girl, broken in the same hidden places, trying to hold one another together to the pulsing rhythm of a dirty guitar.</p><p><i>But it is\u2026</i></p><p>The answer echoed through your mind as the song ended and a new one began, and you both slipped silently into sleep.</p>",

Thanks also to the people who helped me with some of the fanfic ropes. I now know that this is a </p><p><b>Sirius x Reader</b> sitch that does not include\u00a0\u201csmut\u201d lol Just loveyness. And apparently, a great big heaping spoonful of fluffiness as well! :)</p><p>and hereabouts was the original request:</p><p>\u201cCan you do a SiriusxReader with the reader being James\u2019 sister and she\u2019s figured out she has feelings for Sirius but she\u2019s scared to make a move because she doesn\u2019t want everybody mad at her? And then they have a moment while they\u2019re listening to music or at a concert or something and she thinks maybe he has feelings for her too now?\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You couldn\u2019t sleep. </p><p>It was becoming more and more common. Depending on your state of mind, you\u2019d either lie motionless, staring at the canopy for hours, or thrash fitfully until passing out near dawn from the sheer exertion of trying. You\u2019d sleepwalk through the following day, quiet and irritable, desperate to climb out of your own head, falling deeper into it every time you remembered there was no one to whom you could turn with your feelings.</p><p>Your behaviour hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed by your family and friends. James had muttered on more than one occasion that you were turning into Sirius, which <i>certainly</i> did not help. Remus, ever your protector, had tried so many times to talk to you, most recently that very afternoon.</p><p><i>\u201cI know there\u2019s something wrong. You <b>know</b> I know there\u2019s something wrong, so why won\u2019t you just tell me? I\u2019m your best friend.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The look of hurt that passed over his delicate face broke you in two. Merlin knew you <b>wanted</b> to tell him. You were having to dig your fingernails into your thigh, in fact, to keep from just launching yourself into his arms, sobbing into his shoulder, and telling him everything. It would make it all so much easier to bear\u2026 but only for you. Because yes, Remus would stroke your hair, and rock you, and tell you everything was going to be all right, and you knew beyond the shadow of a doubt he\u2019d keep your secret. But then it would change <b>his</b> behaviour, even if only subconsciously. And the boys were too in tune with one other, especially these days. They\u2019d notice, they\u2019d demand he tell them what was going on, and he\u2019d find himself in the same position you were in now. You wouldn\u2019t wish that misery on him for anything.</i></p><p><i>\u201cRemus, do you trust me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He nodded, but sadly, already knowing what was coming next.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d you said, giving him the most convincing smile you could muster. You knew from the look on his face that you hadn\u2019t mustered much at all. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, all right? And nothing I want you dwelling on. I\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</i></p><p>Technically, it would have been easier to unburden yourself to Lily, but you didn\u2019t see a light at the end of <i>that</i> tunnel, either. She\u2019d never be anything other than supportive, but Lily was a fixer. And considering how much she hated Sirius and your brother, her preferred fix would most likely be to try to talk you out of the whole thing altogether. Then again, maybe you should just let her.

                "content": "<p>All right, my dear person who requested this &ndash; this is SO not my wheelhouse, so please&hellip; be gentle. :) I did my best! Thanks also to the people who helped me with some of the fanfic ropes. I now know that this is a </p><p><b>Sirius x Reader</b> sitch that does not include&nbsp;&ldquo;smut&rdquo; lol Just loveyness. And apparently, a great big heaping spoonful of fluffiness as well! :)</p><p>and hereabouts was the original request:</p><p>&ldquo;Can you do a SiriusxReader with the reader being James&rsquo; sister and she&rsquo;s figured out she has feelings for Sirius but she&rsquo;s scared to make a move because she doesn&rsquo;t want everybody mad at her? And then they have a moment while they&rsquo;re listening to music or at a concert or something and she thinks maybe he has feelings for her too now?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t sleep. </p><p>It was becoming more and more common. Depending on your state of mind, you&rsquo;d either lie motionless, staring at the canopy for hours, or thrash fitfully until passing out near dawn from the sheer exertion of trying. You&rsquo;d sleepwalk through the following day, quiet and irritable, desperate to climb out of your own head, falling deeper into it every time you remembered there was no one to whom you could turn with your feelings.</p><p>Your behaviour hadn&rsquo;t gone unnoticed by your family and friends. James had muttered on more than one occasion that you were turning into Sirius, which <i>certainly</i> did not help. Remus, ever your protector, had tried so many times to talk to you, most recently that very afternoon.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s something wrong. You <b>know</b> I know there&rsquo;s something wrong, so why won&rsquo;t you just tell me? I&rsquo;m your best friend.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The look of hurt that passed over his delicate face broke you in two. Merlin knew you <b>wanted</b> to tell him. You were having to dig your fingernails into your thigh, in fact, to keep from just launching yourself into his arms, sobbing into his shoulder, and telling him everything. It would make it all so much easier to bear&hellip; but only for you. Because yes, Remus would stroke your hair, and rock you, and tell you everything was going to be all right, and you knew beyond the shadow of a doubt he&rsquo;d keep your secret. But then it would change <b>his</b> behaviour, even if only subconsciously. And the boys were too in tune with one other, especially these days. They&rsquo;d notice, they&rsquo;d demand he tell them what was going on, and he&rsquo;d find himself in the same position you were in now. You wouldn&rsquo;t wish that misery on him for anything.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Remus, do you trust me?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He nodded, but sadly, already knowing what was coming next.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you said, giving him the most convincing smile you could muster. You knew from the look on his face that you hadn&rsquo;t mustered much at all. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing I can&rsquo;t handle, all right? And nothing I want you dwelling on. I&rsquo;ll work it out.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Technically, it would have been easier to unburden yourself to Lily, but you didn&rsquo;t see a light at the end of <i>that</i> tunnel, either. She&rsquo;d never be anything other than supportive, but Lily was a fixer. And considering how much she hated Sirius and your brother, her preferred fix would most likely be to try to talk you out of the whole thing altogether. Then again, maybe you should just let her. As the universe&rsquo;s cruel jokes went, having you fall in&hellip; whatever this was you were in with Sirius Black had to be up there on the list. </p><p>It certainly hadn&rsquo;t been a conscious effort. In fact, you were entirely baffled as to how it had happened at all, which contributed significantly to your inner turmoil. One minute, you&rsquo;d been roaming the halls of Hogwarts with your brother and his friends, giggling and trodding on one another underneath the invisibility cloak, popping in and out of secret passages, and celebrating in the Gryffindor common room after pulling off another epic prank. The next, Peter was behaving more and more oddly every day, Remus&rsquo;s transformations combined with the changes his body was undergoing had him in a terrible state, James was either failing miserably at wooing Lily or taking out his frustrations on Severus Snape with little else in between, and Sirius had turned quiet, sullen, and moody. And you&hellip; you&rsquo;d woken up one day, walked into the Great Hall for breakfast, and felt your stomach drop into your feet when he glanced up at you.</p><p>You&rsquo;d been exhausting yourself for months trying to reason your way out of it, telling yourself it was just a reaction you were having to his situation. You and Sirius had always been close in that you could open up to one another about the darker aspects of your personalities in ways you couldn&rsquo;t with the others. You both had short fuses and more-destructive-than-average tendencies and devious streaks that frequently tilted more toward reckless abandon than calculated risk, and you were both more than a little afraid of those traits. It was easier &ndash; safer &ndash; to work that out between yourselves. Because of that, you knew quite a bit about Sirius&rsquo;s home life, whereas James, Remus, and Peter knew only what Sirius deemed necessary. You knew what had flipped a switch on Sirius&rsquo;s typically overbearing-yet-affable demeanor was nothing short of pure evil. These&hellip; feelings were nothing more than your desire to help and protect him manifesting oddly. So what if you felt like the breath had been knocked out of you every time he was within five feet of you, if a shiver went down your spine every time he said your name, if your nerves went haywire every time he touched you. Your friend was drowning, and he wouldn&rsquo;t let you throw him a line &ndash; said it was &ldquo;too dangerous now&rdquo; and he didn&rsquo;t want you involved. The rest of this idiocy was just a side effect of your feelings of helplessness.</p><p>And now, he was living in your house. Right down the hall.</p><p>He&rsquo;d finally escaped, and you couldn&rsquo;t have been more thrilled, more relieved. When he&rsquo;d arrived at Potter Manor, you&rsquo;d flung your arms around him freely, crying softly into the crook of his neck as he gently rubbed your back and assured you that everything was going to be just fine from now on. You didn&rsquo;t feel anything in that moment but the pure, overwhelming affection for your friend you&rsquo;d felt ever since the day you met him. Foolishly, you thought that would be the end of it. He was safe now. No more need to lie awake at night worrying about what might be happening to him at Grimmauld Place. No more feeling useless. No more feeling frightened. No more <i>feeling</i>. </p><p>But you&rsquo;d been wrong. Whatever it was &ndash; and it was <i>not</i> love, you reminded yourself repeatedly; you knew enough of that concept to know it was supposed to be all googly eyes and hearts skipping beats and butterflies, not this abject terror you were experiencing &ndash; it was persistent. And you&rsquo;d found yourself simply avoiding him, and, by default, the other boys, while you tried to sort yourself out. It wasn&rsquo;t proving to be a very productive plan of action thus far, but it was all you had.</p><p>Sighing, you rolled out of bed, resolved to head to the family library. If you had to be awake, you could at least try to otherwise occupy your mind.</p><p>As you made your way down the corridor, faint music caught your attention. Following it, you recognised the band. You listened for a moment more before coming to a halt. You knew where the music would be coming from, and your head told you the last thing you needed right now was to be confronted with the very problem that had you out of bed and wandering the manor at this hour in the first place. Your heart, however, seemed to have other ideas &ndash; and had apparently commandeered your feet, as you suddenly found yourself moving toward the sound once again.</p><p>Silently, you turned the knob and cracked the door to Sirius&rsquo;s room. It was dark, but the moonlight spilling in through the window cast sufficient glow. He was seated on the floor, back against the foot of his bed, turntable beside him. He hadn&rsquo;t changed clothes, still clad in the jeans and Queen t-shirt he&rsquo;d worn that day. As &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Get Enough&rdquo; continued to play, he examined the tracklisting on the back of the album, one with which you were familiar. You&rsquo;d bought it yourself just a week before, and you&rsquo;d been excited to get home and play it for him. You knew he&rsquo;d love it. Instead, he&rsquo;d smiled at you, and you&rsquo;d excused yourself to your room for the rest of the day, only partially feigning illness.</p><p>Tears pricked your eyes, and you carefully, soundlessly turned the knob again in order to pull the door back into place.</p><p>&ldquo;You can hear it better from in here, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>You jumped, slamming the door loudly in the process.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit!!&rdquo;</p><p><i>I swear, he&rsquo;s got the wrong Animagus form. Should&rsquo;ve been a bloody bat or something.</i></p><p>Embarrassed at being caught, you grappled with the thought of fleeing back to your room, but that would look even stranger than spying on him. Besides, if he thought all you were trying to do was hear the music, there was no reason to be standing here in the hallway, blushing like a complete idiot. Taking a deep breath, you opened the door.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a right foul mouth on you these days,&rdquo; Sirius chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Wonder where I could&rsquo;ve gotten that from.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a perfect angel, just ask your mum.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked up at you, pulling a wide-eyed, innocent face. You forced a laugh to accompany the quickly exhaled breath that fled your lungs. The moonlight cascaded across his face, highlighting his handsome features, lending an unearthly shimmer to his dark hair.</p><p><i>An angel. That&rsquo;s <b>exactly</b> what he looks like.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sleep again?&rdquo; he asked, turning the music down a bit. </p><p>You shook your head, moving to take a seat on the floor opposite him. Instead, he patted the space beside him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see the liner notes from there,&rdquo; he reasoned. You couldn&rsquo;t seem to feel your legs, but you were grateful when they somehow lowered you onto the spot he indicated rather than dropping you like a wet rag onto the turntable.</p><p>Sirius held the album where you could see it, unaware you were already familiar with every track.</p><p>&ldquo;Bad Company. Brand new. I&rsquo;m into it. There&rsquo;s a tune on here I swear was written specifically about the Marauders,&rdquo; he grinned.</p><p>You knew to which song he referred. The title track. Trade &ldquo;gun&rdquo; for &ldquo;wand&rdquo;, and it would be just about spot on. You managed a smile as the opening notes of &ldquo;Rock Steady&rdquo;, your favourite track, began.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a great one as well,&rdquo; Sirius said, turning the volume back up before settling against the end of his bed. &ldquo;Lean back,&rdquo; he instructed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll clear your head, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Sirius had pulled his blankets down to cushion the bed frame, and you pressed yourself into them.</p><p><i>Close my eyes, and I let myself go<br />Listen to, oh, baby, let the music flow</i></p><p>Slowly, your eyelids drooped as you allowed the music to wash over you. It had been impossible lately to focus. Stress, confliction, fear &ndash; they&rsquo;d all combined to keep your mind swirling constantly, making you feel out of place and confused. At night, with nothing to distract you, it was worse. You felt like you were living multiple lives all at once. But now, with a newly loved song surrounding you as warmly as the soft blankets behind your back, you were nowhere but here.</p><p>With him.</p><p>You opened your eyes and turned your head to find Sirius staring at you. Inhaling sharply, your body tried to react &ndash; to look away. You needed to look away. But you felt pinned to the spot by his gaze. In the moonlight, his grey eyes were nearly silver, and you felt the sensation of falling into them. You wanted to fight it but found yourself lacking the strength. You realised you weren&rsquo;t breathing. A part of you didn&rsquo;t care. The thought of the pain of the last several months just melting away to nothing seemed incredibly appealing. And he would be the last thing you ever saw.</p><p><i>Turn on your light<br />And stay with me awhile<br />And ease your worried mind<br />Turn on your light<br />And stay with me awhile</i></p><p>You took a slow breath, suddenly wanting to live again.</p><p>Numb as you were, you barely felt it when Sirius&rsquo;s arm slipped around your waist, drawing you against his side. You exhaled. You felt miles above your body when your head dropped of its own volition onto his shoulder. You plummeted back down into yourself at the sensation of his cheek coming to rest on your forehead. He reached over with his free hand and gently took yours, slowly interlacing your fingers. You inhaled. He smelled like the cedar trees around the Black Lake after a storm. And firewhisky and tobacco and&hellip;</p><p><i>Vice.</i></p><p>A truth at once comforting and terrifying dawned on you: You had never wanted anything more than you wanted to remain in this moment, always&hellip; to let time and space and fate crumble around you unnoticed.
