TW for panic attacks, blood, and accidental self-harm caused by a nightmare.<br/></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18564727/chapters/44005264\">Read from the beginning on AO3</a> if you prefer! I\u2019m tagging anyone who left a note on the previous chapter here as well, hope that\u2019s OK!</b></p><p>Loki woke with a jolt, his heart pounding, nightmares of a frozen world and evil red eyes lingering in the fringes of his mind. He lifted trembling hands to cover his face, and nearly screamed.</p><p>He stumbled out of bed, his heart thumping, trying to get <i>away</i> from the vicious black claws, the blue skin that had haunted his nightmares since his childhood. He scratched at his arm, tore at the pale lines raised in the skin, whimpering and panicking, the quiet, calm voice inside now drowned out by the storm, and he couldn\u2019t find himself, couldn\u2019t dig himself out from under this hellish mask, this curse, this\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey! Hey, Loki, please, calm, will you? Hey, look at me? I\u2019m not going to touch you, alright? I just want you to look at the lights, can you do that? Can you breathe in with the light as it gets brighter? That\u2019s great, keep going\u2026 OK, and now out. Like you\u2019re whistling, purse your lips, yeah, just like that. Now in, feel it\u2026 feel it filling you up or\u2026 yeah, this is good. That\u2019s great, buddy. OK, I\u2019m just gonna\u2026 can I see your arms?\u201d</p><p>Stark came closer, still holding his hands out in front of him and looking as unthreatening as possible. Logically Loki could see that he was <i>very</i>unthreatening, a small mortal in soft clothing, hair still sleep-mussed and face pillow-creased, but with his heart still hammering inside his own chest, he couldn\u2019t handle logic at all. He tugged his arms closer to himself, fingers slick with his own blood.</p><p>Then he looked down. The blood was indigo. He whimpered and pushed his arms out as far from himself as he could, staggering backwards, his breathing speeding up again.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s OK! I\u2019ll get them fixed up, no worries.\u201d Stark cupped his hands around Loki\u2019s wrists, making a surprised hum. \u201cWow, you\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>Loki let out a burst of hysterical laughter that very nearly turned into a sob. How utterly pathetic. To have been reduced to a scared child, cowering in someone else\u2019s room, terrified of his own appearance after a nightmare\u2026 Loki turned his face and closed his eyes. It was almost unbearable.</p><p>Stark tugged him gently over to the bed, encouraging him to sit. He left him there, staring down helplessly, hatefully, at his blue, bleeding arms. \u201cHere we go,\u201d Stark said a moment later, setting a bowl of water down by Loki\u2019s feet. He took Loki\u2019s wrist in his hand and started dabbing the blood away, staining the water an inky blue. Loki stared at the colour diffusing through the water and tried not to despair.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d Stark said with a grin. Loki looked at his forearms, wrapped in pristine white bandages. He felt emptied out, like his heart had been excavated from his chest, leaving him dull and hollow. Stark\u2019s smile slowly slipped from his face and he bit his lip. \u201cAh, do you\u2026 do you want to talk a bit?\u201d</p><p>Loki blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cLike, uh\u2026 do you maybe want to\u2026 were you trying to, um. Were you <i>trying</i> to hurt yourself? Is this, like, a self-harm thing? Because I won\u2019t judge, I just\u2026\u201d He scruffed his hair. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not very good at this shit. Are you\u2026 OK?\u201d He winced and looked at Loki sideways, almost as if he thought Loki would strike him for his question.</p><p>\u201cNo, Stark,\u201d said Loki, his voice sounding very distant. \u201cI am not OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I kinda\u2026 got that.\u201d Stark sat on his haunches and rubbed his face. \u201cYou know what? We need a load of breakfast. I\u2019m thinking pastries and donuts, something that won\u2019t go cold or soggy, and then I think you should tell me all about it. I mean, I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be any help.\u201d He winced again. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ll probably be shit. Like, worse than nothing. I\u2019m not\u2026 the best listener. Or the best friend. But\u2026\u201d he shrugged and looked away like he didn\u2019t care at all. \u201cYeah, croissants! JARVIS, could you order us, eh, I dunno, one of everything from Belle Maison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sir,\u201d JARVIS replied.</p><p>Loki looked up in the direction of the voice. He had been introduced to JARVIS the night before, but this morning, after a night of somewhat effective sleep, he could cling to the fascination sparking in his chest, distract himself. \u201cIs your companion made of magic?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat, JARV? Nah - or, well, he\u2019s an AI - artificial intelligence. He\u2019s made out of computer code and electronics and\u2026 stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blush, Sir,\u201d said JARVIS dryly.</p><p>Stark just smirked. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the bots in a minute, it might make a bit more sense then. Assuming you\u2019re still up for a bit of research in a while?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Loki felt the cold flood through his system once more, ridiculous for a Frost Giant. He had forgotten during Stark\u2019s treatment of him this morning that he was little more than a prisoner here. He was Stark\u2019s research project, and nothing more - this had not been kindness, but a care for one\u2019s tools. Loki summoned up a professional mask and nodded.</p><p>Stark blinked, his own smile faltering. \u201cOK\u2026 OK, if you\u2019re sure? Anyway. For now, do you want a coffee or something? I need coffee, I\u2019m not human without the first one of the morning.\u201d</p><p>Loki narrowed his eyes at him. \u201cHyperbole?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Stark winked at him. \u201cOnly just. C\u2019mon, Billy Goat Gruff, let me hook you up with the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>Loki had hoped that the distraction of breakfast and coffee would make Stark forget his demand that they talk, but once they\u2019d eaten a couple of the sweet treats, he tapped his fingernails on the polished stone of the high table he called a breakfast bar. \u201cSo, Loki-Doki, you wanna tell me your story? How did you end up in a crater on another planet causing snow in the desert?\u201d</p><p>Loki closed his eyes for just a moment, put his pastry down on the plate and clenched his hands into fists under the table. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he said, his voice strained.</p><p>Stark frowned. \u201cHey, no, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t wanna tell me, you know? I just\u2026 thought it might\u2026\u201d He scrubbed his hair again. \u201cI dunno, help? People are always asking me if I want to talk, I just thought it was the done thing, or something. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am yours to command.\u201d</p><p>Stark made a face. \u201cNot really, though.\u201d His eyes suddenly widened. \u201cHoly shit. Holy\u2026 did I say something? Was there a culture clash here? Have I like\u2026 I didn\u2019t sign you up to be my indentured servant or some bullshit, did I?\u201d</p><p>Loki peered up at him, surprised at himself that his head had ducked so low, that his shoulders were so hunched over. \u201cYou said you would give me sanctuary in exchange for experiments\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did imply something along those lines, Sir,\u201d JARVIS interjected.</p><p>Stark pressed his hands to his cheeks. \u201cWhat the fuck? Why didn\u2019t you tell me, JARV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise that Master Loki would take the combination of words in such a literal way. My apologies, Sir. And to Master Loki.\u201d</p><p>Loki frowned. \u201cYou did not\u2026 but why would you take me in if not to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, sure, I wanted to study you,\u201d Stark wailed. \u201cBut only if you wanted to find stuff out too, or like, show off\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to be here against your will, holy <i>shit</i>, have I kidnapped you? Oh my god, I\u2019m so sorry, shit!\u201d</p><p>Loki blinked, shocked. Stark was apologising? To him? And in such distress! But Loki was nothing to him, here he was not even a prince, why would Stark care about whether or not Loki would choose to be with him? \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 you do not have to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I thought we were just gonna do some cool science together, I had no idea I was dragging you here like some sort of a threat, am I SHIELD in this situation? Oh my god, I\u2019m basically Agent, guh, I\u2019m gonna be sick, JARVIS!\u201d He turned to Loki with wild eyes. \u201cI am really, really sorry.\u201d</p><p>Loki stared at him. There was a warmth in his chest, a spreading feeling he barely recognised. When was the last time someone had apologised to him? Someone of consequence, not a servant or a subject - and even then, they would always do so with gritted teeth. Loki knew he was unpopular. He\u2019d never attempted to change that - it had always seemed so immutable a fact. Loki the trickster, don\u2019t trust him, don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t spend any time near him in case he turns you into a goat.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2026 I would like to stay,\u201d he said, and he tried to hide a wince at how vulnerable his voice sounded. \u201cI am interested in your science. In our differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stark said, freezing in his distressed motions. \u201cAre you sure, though? You\u2019re not just saying that because I\u2019ve, like, activated some hospitality clause I didn\u2019t know about? You\u2019re choosing to&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am choosing, freely,\u201d he said, swallowing and looking up at Stark. \u201cIf I am welcome, still?\u201d</p><p>Stark\u2019s face broke into a wide grin. \u201cHell, yeah, you\u2019re welcome!\u201d He let out a long breath. \u201cPhew, god, that was awful!\u201d</p><p>Loki\u2019s lip quirked up. \u201cWhy was it so awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what life\u2019s like on your planet or whatever, but we humans don\u2019t like coercing other people.\u201d He made a face. \u201cWell, the non-assholes don\u2019t. Yeah, actually, scrap that? <i>I</i> don\u2019t like coercing people. I can\u2019t talk for the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>Loki grinned. \u201cYour realm is not so different from mine, in that case. It sounds as if there are plenty of assholes in both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, honestly, I probably count as one of the assholes most of the time.\u201d Tony shrugged. \u201cHey, do you want to go down to the lab now? I can show you the bots, and we can find out what your alien biology looks like on my holos.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Loki was reminded what he was, his freakish blue skin, the horns, the demonic red of his eyes. He held himself still, trying not to wince, trying not to react, for how could he explain <i>this?</i> He would just have to control his expressions, focus on the science. Because perhaps there would be something in Stark\u2019s \u2018lab\u2019 which would help him to find his way back to his old - no, his <i>true</i> form.</p><p>But Stark stopped mid-sentence. \u201cNo? What? What is it? We won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said, biting his bottom lip again.</p><p>Had he always been this obvious? No-one in Asgard would ever have noticed, but Stark had spotted his reticence at once - and Loki had been actively trying to hide it. Had his masks ever been as strong as he had believed? Or had nobody ever been truly looking? Loki stared at Stark, amazed at the perceptiveness of this small, sparkling mortal. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Loki, we won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to, OK?\u201d Stark said, holding his gaze. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t like, we\u2019ll stop, no matter how far through the process we are, if there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t even like the look of, we won\u2019t do it. And of course, I\u2019ll put myself through everything you do - like, except for actually doing magic, \u2018cause I can\u2019t. Oh, and I can\u2019t go into an MRI because of this,\u201d he added, tapping the centre of his chest over the odd glow. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do that either.\u201d</p><p>Loki searched his face for any hint of a trick, any lie, and found only compassion. He swallowed hard. \u201cI do not look like this,\u201d he said, his voice nothing more than a croak. \u201cI mean\u2026 not usually.\u201d He looked down at his hands, clenching them into fists and feeling the sharp, obsidian nails digging into his skin. \u201cI was Aesir - I <i>am</i> Aesir. I <i>must</i> be. But\u2026 during my brother\u2019s coronation, I just\u2026 this happened. I turned into this\u2026 this monster, and now\u2026 now my magic is different, cold\u2026\u201d he took a deep, shuddering breath, the fear sending icy tendrils through every nerve. He looked at the table and gasped. Frost swirled out from every contact point with his skin, and he jerked his hands back in horror.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s OK,\u201d Stark said, holding his hands out, placating the beast once more. \u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cHey, I know we said we didn\u2019t have to talk, but do you want to tell me about it? And then\u2026 maybe we can get you back to normal?\u201d</p><p>Tags from last chapter: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVcxTi_wzXtTCRLFA_lunBQ\">@aformingsiren</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2p4PS35VGR_I0LJpuVgtdQ\">@sketch953</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYGH8t3UpHi3YAF78b7zypg\">@massivelandthingdonkey</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIWGV7hOKbNku5FY50PxjvQ\">@angrysockpuppetnoises</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc6e-Tj4wz2R6l9GlobvxA\">@ultra-rare-pegacorn</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHpAxu2dqbuYt4I7avjFQ_Q\">@redramzi</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mctcfsck03U1Le1yg8Hy_lA\">@senpaiweird</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0MM1GZyJ2KF6Z9FJej-_IQ\">@giggling-breeze</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoc8LutC8fuGbQUgR13IBA\">@rarepair-collector</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXmiDAWzEdlexipT1XuilA\">@saturnjuice</a>, @kuree06 &lt;3</p>",

Assuming you\u2019re still up for a bit of research in a while?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Loki felt the cold flood through his system once more, ridiculous for a Frost Giant. He had forgotten during Stark\u2019s treatment of him this morning that he was little more than a prisoner here. He was Stark\u2019s research project, and nothing more - this had not been kindness, but a care for one\u2019s tools. Loki summoned up a professional mask and nodded.</p><p>Stark blinked, his own smile faltering. \u201cOK\u2026 OK, if you\u2019re sure? Anyway. For now, do you want a coffee or something? I need coffee, I\u2019m not human without the first one of the morning.\u201d</p><p>Loki narrowed his eyes at him. \u201cHyperbole?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Stark winked at him. \u201cOnly just. C\u2019mon, Billy Goat Gruff, let me hook you up with the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>Loki had hoped that the distraction of breakfast and coffee would make Stark forget his demand that they talk, but once they\u2019d eaten a couple of the sweet treats, he tapped his fingernails on the polished stone of the high table he called a breakfast bar. \u201cSo, Loki-Doki, you wanna tell me your story? How did you end up in a crater on another planet causing snow in the desert?\u201d</p><p>Loki closed his eyes for just a moment, put his pastry down on the plate and clenched his hands into fists under the table. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he said, his voice strained.</p><p>Stark frowned. \u201cHey, no, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t wanna tell me, you know? I just\u2026 thought it might\u2026\u201d He scrubbed his hair again. \u201cI dunno, help? People are always asking me if I want to talk, I just thought it was the done thing, or something. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am yours to command.\u201d</p><p>Stark made a face. \u201cNot really, though.\u201d His eyes suddenly widened. \u201cHoly shit. Holy\u2026 did I say something? Was there a culture clash here? Have I like\u2026 I didn\u2019t sign you up to be my indentured servant or some bullshit, did I?\u201d</p><p>Loki peered up at him, surprised at himself that his head had ducked so low, that his shoulders were so hunched over. \u201cYou said you would give me sanctuary in exchange for experiments\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did imply something along those lines, Sir,\u201d JARVIS interjected.</p><p>Stark pressed his hands to his cheeks. \u201cWhat the fuck? Why didn\u2019t you tell me, JARV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise that Master Loki would take the combination of words in such a literal way. My apologies, Sir. And to Master Loki.\u201d</p><p>Loki frowned. \u201cYou did not\u2026 but why would you take me in if not to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, sure, I wanted to study you,\u201d Stark wailed. \u201cBut only if you wanted to find stuff out too, or like, show off\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to be here against your will, holy <i>shit</i>, have I kidnapped you? Oh my god, I\u2019m so sorry, shit!\u201d</p><p>Loki blinked, shocked. Stark was apologising? To him? And in such distress! But Loki was nothing to him, here he was not even a prince, why would Stark care about whether or not Loki would choose to be with him? \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 you do not have to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I thought we were just gonna do some cool science together, I had no idea I was dragging you here like some sort of a threat, am I SHIELD in this situation? Oh my god, I\u2019m basically Agent, guh, I\u2019m gonna be sick, JARVIS!\u201d He turned to Loki with wild eyes. \u201cI am really, really sorry.\u201d</p><p>Loki stared at him. There was a warmth in his chest, a spreading feeling he barely recognised. When was the last time someone had apologised to him? Someone of consequence, not a servant or a subject - and even then, they would always do so with gritted teeth. Loki knew he was unpopular. He\u2019d never attempted to change that - it had always seemed so immutable a fact. Loki the trickster, don\u2019t trust him, don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t spend any time near him in case he turns you into a goat.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2026 I would like to stay,\u201d he said, and he tried to hide a wince at how vulnerable his voice sounded. \u201cI am interested in your science. In our differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stark said, freezing in his distressed motions. \u201cAre you sure, though? You\u2019re not just saying that because I\u2019ve, like, activated some hospitality clause I didn\u2019t know about? You\u2019re choosing to\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am choosing, freely,\u201d he said, swallowing and looking up at Stark. \u201cIf I am welcome, still?\u201d</p><p>Stark\u2019s face broke into a wide grin. \u201cHell, yeah, you\u2019re welcome!\u201d He let out a long breath. \u201cPhew, god, that was awful!\u201d</p><p>Loki\u2019s lip quirked up. \u201cWhy was it so awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what life\u2019s like on your planet or whatever, but we humans don\u2019t like coercing other people.\u201d He made a face. \u201cWell, the non-assholes don\u2019t. Yeah, actually, scrap that? <i>I</i> don\u2019t like coercing people. I can\u2019t talk for the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>Loki grinned. \u201cYour realm is not so different from mine, in that case. It sounds as if there are plenty of assholes in both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, honestly, I probably count as one of the assholes most of the time.\u201d Tony shrugged. \u201cHey, do you want to go down to the lab now? I can show you the bots, and we can find out what your alien biology looks like on my holos.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Loki was reminded what he was, his freakish blue skin, the horns, the demonic red of his eyes. He held himself still, trying not to wince, trying not to react, for how could he explain <i>this?</i> He would just have to control his expressions, focus on the science. Because perhaps there would be something in Stark\u2019s \u2018lab\u2019 which would help him to find his way back to his old - no, his <i>true</i> form.</p><p>But Stark stopped mid-sentence. \u201cNo? What? What is it? We won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said, biting his bottom lip again.</p><p>Had he always been this obvious?

And of course, I\u2019ll put myself through everything you do - like, except for actually doing magic, \u2018cause I can\u2019t. Oh, and I can\u2019t go into an MRI because of this,\u201d he added, tapping the centre of his chest over the odd glow. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do that either.\u201d</p><p>Loki searched his face for any hint of a trick, any lie, and found only compassion. He swallowed hard. \u201cI do not look like this,\u201d he said, his voice nothing more than a croak. \u201cI mean\u2026 not usually.\u201d He looked down at his hands, clenching them into fists and feeling the sharp, obsidian nails digging into his skin. \u201cI was Aesir - I <i>am</i> Aesir. I <i>must</i> be. But\u2026 during my brother\u2019s coronation, I just\u2026 this happened.

He lifted trembling hands to cover his face, and nearly screamed.</p><p>He stumbled out of bed, his heart thumping, trying to get <i>away</i> from the vicious black claws, the blue skin that had haunted his nightmares since his childhood. He scratched at his arm, tore at the pale lines raised in the skin, whimpering and panicking, the quiet, calm voice inside now drowned out by the storm, and he couldn\u2019t find himself, couldn\u2019t dig himself out from under this hellish mask, this curse, this\u2026</p><p>\u201cHey! Hey, Loki, please, calm, will you? Hey, look at me? I\u2019m not going to touch you, alright? I just want you to look at the lights, can you do that? Can you breathe in with the light as it gets brighter? That\u2019s great, keep going\u2026 OK, and now out. Like you\u2019re whistling, purse your lips, yeah, just like that. Now in, feel it\u2026 feel it filling you up or\u2026 yeah, this is good. That\u2019s great, buddy. OK, I\u2019m just gonna\u2026 can I see your arms?\u201d</p><p>Stark came closer, still holding his hands out in front of him and looking as unthreatening as possible. Logically Loki could see that he was <i>very</i>unthreatening, a small mortal in soft clothing, hair still sleep-mussed and face pillow-creased, but with his heart still hammering inside his own chest, he couldn\u2019t handle logic at all. He tugged his arms closer to himself, fingers slick with his own blood.</p><p>Then he looked down. The blood was indigo. He whimpered and pushed his arms out as far from himself as he could, staggering backwards, his breathing speeding up again.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s OK! I\u2019ll get them fixed up, no worries.\u201d Stark cupped his hands around Loki\u2019s wrists, making a surprised hum. \u201cWow, you\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>Loki let out a burst of hysterical laughter that very nearly turned into a sob. How utterly pathetic. To have been reduced to a scared child, cowering in someone else\u2019s room, terrified of his own appearance after a nightmare\u2026 Loki turned his face and closed his eyes. It was almost unbearable.</p><p>Stark tugged him gently over to the bed, encouraging him to sit. He left him there, staring down helplessly, hatefully, at his blue, bleeding arms. \u201cHere we go,\u201d Stark said a moment later, setting a bowl of water down by Loki\u2019s feet. He took Loki\u2019s wrist in his hand and started dabbing the blood away, staining the water an inky blue. Loki stared at the colour diffusing through the water and tried not to despair.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d Stark said with a grin. Loki looked at his forearms, wrapped in pristine white bandages. He felt emptied out, like his heart had been excavated from his chest, leaving him dull and hollow. Stark\u2019s smile slowly slipped from his face and he bit his lip. \u201cAh, do you\u2026 do you want to talk a bit?\u201d</p><p>Loki blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cLike, uh\u2026 do you maybe want to\u2026 were you trying to, um. Were you <i>trying</i> to hurt yourself? Is this, like, a self-harm thing? Because I won\u2019t judge, I just\u2026\u201d He scruffed his hair. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not very good at this shit. Are you\u2026 OK?\u201d He winced and looked at Loki sideways, almost as if he thought Loki would strike him for his question.</p><p>\u201cNo, Stark,\u201d said Loki, his voice sounding very distant. \u201cI am not OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I kinda\u2026 got that.\u201d Stark sat on his haunches and rubbed his face. \u201cYou know what? We need a load of breakfast. I\u2019m thinking pastries and donuts, something that won\u2019t go cold or soggy, and then I think you should tell me all about it. I mean, I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be any help.\u201d He winced again. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ll probably be shit. Like, worse than nothing. I\u2019m not\u2026 the best listener. Or the best friend. But\u2026\u201d he shrugged and looked away like he didn\u2019t care at all. \u201cYeah, croissants! JARVIS, could you order us, eh, I dunno, one of everything from Belle Maison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sir,\u201d JARVIS replied.</p><p>Loki looked up in the direction of the voice. He had been introduced to JARVIS the night before, but this morning, after a night of somewhat effective sleep, he could cling to the fascination sparking in his chest, distract himself. \u201cIs your companion made of magic?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat, JARV? Nah - or, well, he\u2019s an AI - artificial intelligence. He\u2019s made out of computer code and electronics and\u2026 stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blush, Sir,\u201d said JARVIS dryly.</p><p>Stark just smirked. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the bots in a minute, it might make a bit more sense then. Assuming you\u2019re still up for a bit of research in a while?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Loki felt the cold flood through his system once more, ridiculous for a Frost Giant. He had forgotten during Stark\u2019s treatment of him this morning that he was little more than a prisoner here. He was Stark\u2019s research project, and nothing more - this had not been kindness, but a care for one\u2019s tools. Loki summoned up a professional mask and nodded.</p><p>Stark blinked, his own smile faltering. \u201cOK\u2026 OK, if you\u2019re sure? Anyway. For now, do you want a coffee or something? I need coffee, I\u2019m not human without the first one of the morning.\u201d</p><p>Loki narrowed his eyes at him. \u201cHyperbole?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Stark winked at him. \u201cOnly just. C\u2019mon, Billy Goat Gruff, let me hook you up with the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>Loki had hoped that the distraction of breakfast and coffee would make Stark forget his demand that they talk, but once they\u2019d eaten a couple of the sweet treats, he tapped his fingernails on the polished stone of the high table he called a breakfast bar. \u201cSo, Loki-Doki, you wanna tell me your story? How did you end up in a crater on another planet causing snow in the desert?\u201d</p><p>Loki closed his eyes for just a moment, put his pastry down on the plate and clenched his hands into fists under the table. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he said, his voice strained.</p><p>Stark frowned. \u201cHey, no, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t wanna tell me, you know? I just\u2026 thought it might\u2026\u201d He scrubbed his hair again. \u201cI dunno, help? People are always asking me if I want to talk, I just thought it was the done thing, or something. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am yours to command.\u201d</p><p>Stark made a face. \u201cNot really, though.\u201d His eyes suddenly widened. \u201cHoly shit. Holy\u2026 did I say something? Was there a culture clash here? Have I like\u2026 I didn\u2019t sign you up to be my indentured servant or some bullshit, did I?\u201d</p><p>Loki peered up at him, surprised at himself that his head had ducked so low, that his shoulders were so hunched over. \u201cYou said you would give me sanctuary in exchange for experiments\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did imply something along those lines, Sir,\u201d JARVIS interjected.</p><p>Stark pressed his hands to his cheeks. \u201cWhat the fuck? Why didn\u2019t you tell me, JARV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise that Master Loki would take the combination of words in such a literal way. My apologies, Sir. And to Master Loki.\u201d</p><p>Loki frowned. \u201cYou did not\u2026 but why would you take me in if not to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, sure, I wanted to study you,\u201d Stark wailed. \u201cBut only if you wanted to find stuff out too, or like, show off\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to be here against your will, holy <i>shit</i>, have I kidnapped you? Oh my god, I\u2019m so sorry, shit!\u201d</p><p>Loki blinked, shocked. Stark was apologising? To him? And in such distress! But Loki was nothing to him, here he was not even a prince, why would Stark care about whether or not Loki would choose to be with him? \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 you do not have to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I thought we were just gonna do some cool science together, I had no idea I was dragging you here like some sort of a threat, am I SHIELD in this situation? Oh my god, I\u2019m basically Agent, guh, I\u2019m gonna be sick, JARVIS!\u201d He turned to Loki with wild eyes. \u201cI am really, really sorry.\u201d</p><p>Loki stared at him. There was a warmth in his chest, a spreading feeling he barely recognised. When was the last time someone had apologised to him? Someone of consequence, not a servant or a subject - and even then, they would always do so with gritted teeth. Loki knew he was unpopular. He\u2019d never attempted to change that - it had always seemed so immutable a fact. Loki the trickster, don\u2019t trust him, don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t spend any time near him in case he turns you into a goat.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2026 I would like to stay,\u201d he said, and he tried to hide a wince at how vulnerable his voice sounded. \u201cI am interested in your science. In our differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stark said, freezing in his distressed motions. \u201cAre you sure, though? You\u2019re not just saying that because I\u2019ve, like, activated some hospitality clause I didn\u2019t know about? You\u2019re choosing to\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am choosing, freely,\u201d he said, swallowing and looking up at Stark. \u201cIf I am welcome, still?\u201d</p><p>Stark\u2019s face broke into a wide grin. \u201cHell, yeah, you\u2019re welcome!\u201d He let out a long breath. \u201cPhew, god, that was awful!\u201d</p><p>Loki\u2019s lip quirked up. \u201cWhy was it so awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what life\u2019s like on your planet or whatever, but we humans don\u2019t like coercing other people.\u201d He made a face. \u201cWell, the non-assholes don\u2019t. Yeah, actually, scrap that? <i>I</i> don\u2019t like coercing people. I can\u2019t talk for the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>Loki grinned. \u201cYour realm is not so different from mine, in that case. It sounds as if there are plenty of assholes in both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, honestly, I probably count as one of the assholes most of the time.\u201d Tony shrugged. \u201cHey, do you want to go down to the lab now? I can show you the bots, and we can find out what your alien biology looks like on my holos.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Loki was reminded what he was, his freakish blue skin, the horns, the demonic red of his eyes. He held himself still, trying not to wince, trying not to react, for how could he explain <i>this?</i> He would just have to control his expressions, focus on the science. Because perhaps there would be something in Stark\u2019s \u2018lab\u2019 which would help him to find his way back to his old - no, his <i>true</i> form.</p><p>But Stark stopped mid-sentence. \u201cNo? What? What is it? We won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said, biting his bottom lip again.</p><p>Had he always been this obvious? No-one in Asgard would ever have noticed, but Stark had spotted his reticence at once - and Loki had been actively trying to hide it. Had his masks ever been as strong as he had believed? Or had nobody ever been truly looking? Loki stared at Stark, amazed at the perceptiveness of this small, sparkling mortal. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Loki, we won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to, OK?\u201d Stark said, holding his gaze. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t like, we\u2019ll stop, no matter how far through the process we are, if there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t even like the look of, we won\u2019t do it. And of course, I\u2019ll put myself through everything you do - like, except for actually doing magic, \u2018cause I can\u2019t. Oh, and I can\u2019t go into an MRI because of this,\u201d he added, tapping the centre of his chest over the odd glow. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do that either.\u201d</p><p>Loki searched his face for any hint of a trick, any lie, and found only compassion. He swallowed hard. \u201cI do not look like this,\u201d he said, his voice nothing more than a croak. \u201cI mean\u2026 not usually.\u201d He looked down at his hands, clenching them into fists and feeling the sharp, obsidian nails digging into his skin. \u201cI was Aesir - I <i>am</i> Aesir. I <i>must</i> be. But\u2026 during my brother\u2019s coronation, I just\u2026 this happened. I turned into this\u2026 this monster, and now\u2026 now my magic is different, cold\u2026\u201d he took a deep, shuddering breath, the fear sending icy tendrils through every nerve. He looked at the table and gasped. Frost swirled out from every contact point with his skin, and he jerked his hands back in horror.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s OK,\u201d Stark said, holding his hands out, placating the beast once more. \u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cHey, I know we said we didn\u2019t have to talk, but do you want to tell me about it? And then\u2026 maybe we can get you back to normal?\u201d</p><p>Tags from last chapter: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVcxTi_wzXtTCRLFA_lunBQ\">@aformingsiren</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2p4PS35VGR_I0LJpuVgtdQ\">@sketch953</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYGH8t3UpHi3YAF78b7zypg\">@massivelandthingdonkey</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIWGV7hOKbNku5FY50PxjvQ\">@angrysockpuppetnoises</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc6e-Tj4wz2R6l9GlobvxA\">@ultra-rare-pegacorn</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHpAxu2dqbuYt4I7avjFQ_Q\">@redramzi</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mctcfsck03U1Le1yg8Hy_lA\">@senpaiweird</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0MM1GZyJ2KF6Z9FJej-_IQ\">@giggling-breeze</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoc8LutC8fuGbQUgR13IBA\">@rarepair-collector</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXmiDAWzEdlexipT1XuilA\">@saturnjuice</a>, @kuree06 &lt;3</p>",

Were you <i>trying</i> to hurt yourself? Is this, like, a self-harm thing? Because I won&rsquo;t judge, I just&hellip;&rdquo; He scruffed his hair. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m not very good at this shit. Are you&hellip; OK?&rdquo; He winced and looked at Loki sideways, almost as if he thought Loki would strike him for his question.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Stark,&rdquo; said Loki, his voice sounding very distant. &ldquo;I am not OK.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I kinda&hellip; got that.&rdquo; Stark sat on his haunches and rubbed his face. &ldquo;You know what? We need a load of breakfast. I&rsquo;m thinking pastries and donuts, something that won&rsquo;t go cold or soggy, and then I think you should tell me all about it. I mean, I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll be any help.&rdquo; He winced again. &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;ll probably be shit. Like, worse than nothing. I&rsquo;m not&hellip; the best listener. Or the best friend. But&hellip;&rdquo; he shrugged and looked away like he didn&rsquo;t care at all. &ldquo;Yeah, croissants! JARVIS, could you order us, eh, I dunno, one of everything from Belle Maison?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Sir,&rdquo; JARVIS replied.</p><p>Loki looked up in the direction of the voice. He had been introduced to JARVIS the night before, but this morning, after a night of somewhat effective sleep, he could cling to the fascination sparking in his chest, distract himself. &ldquo;Is your companion made of magic?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;What, JARV? Nah - or, well, he&rsquo;s an AI - artificial intelligence. He&rsquo;s made out of computer code and electronics and&hellip; stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I blush, Sir,&rdquo; said JARVIS dryly.</p><p>Stark just smirked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the bots in a minute, it might make a bit more sense then. Assuming you&rsquo;re still up for a bit of research in a while?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki felt the cold flood through his system once more, ridiculous for a Frost Giant. He had forgotten during Stark&rsquo;s treatment of him this morning that he was little more than a prisoner here. He was Stark&rsquo;s research project, and nothing more - this had not been kindness, but a care for one&rsquo;s tools. Loki summoned up a professional mask and nodded.</p><p>Stark blinked, his own smile faltering. &ldquo;OK&hellip; OK, if you&rsquo;re sure? Anyway. For now, do you want a coffee or something? I need coffee, I&rsquo;m not human without the first one of the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki narrowed his eyes at him. &ldquo;Hyperbole?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Stark winked at him. &ldquo;Only just. C&rsquo;mon, Billy Goat Gruff, let me hook you up with the good stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki had hoped that the distraction of breakfast and coffee would make Stark forget his demand that they talk, but once they&rsquo;d eaten a couple of the sweet treats, he tapped his fingernails on the polished stone of the high table he called a breakfast bar. &ldquo;So, Loki-Doki, you wanna tell me your story? How did you end up in a crater on another planet causing snow in the desert?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki closed his eyes for just a moment, put his pastry down on the plate and clenched his hands into fists under the table. &ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; he said, his voice strained.</p><p>Stark frowned. &ldquo;Hey, no, it&rsquo;s fine if you don&rsquo;t wanna tell me, you know? I just&hellip; thought it might&hellip;&rdquo; He scrubbed his hair again. &ldquo;I dunno, help? People are always asking me if I want to talk, I just thought it was the done thing, or something. You don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I am yours to command.&rdquo;</p><p>Stark made a face. &ldquo;Not really, though.&rdquo; His eyes suddenly widened. &ldquo;Holy shit. Holy&hellip; did I say something? Was there a culture clash here? Have I like&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t sign you up to be my indentured servant or some bullshit, did I?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki peered up at him, surprised at himself that his head had ducked so low, that his shoulders were so hunched over. &ldquo;You said you would give me sanctuary in exchange for experiments&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did imply something along those lines, Sir,&rdquo; JARVIS interjected.</p><p>Stark pressed his hands to his cheeks. &ldquo;What the fuck? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, JARV?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise that Master Loki would take the combination of words in such a literal way. My apologies, Sir. And to Master Loki.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki frowned. &ldquo;You did not&hellip; but why would you take me in if not to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, sure, I wanted to study you,&rdquo; Stark wailed. &ldquo;But only if you wanted to find stuff out too, or like, show off&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want you to be here against your will, holy <i>shit</i>, have I kidnapped you? Oh my god, I&rsquo;m so sorry, shit!&rdquo;</p><p>Loki blinked, shocked. Stark was apologising? To him? And in such distress! But Loki was nothing to him, here he was not even a prince, why would Stark care about whether or not Loki would choose to be with him? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; you do not have to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, I thought we were just gonna do some cool science together, I had no idea I was dragging you here like some sort of a threat, am I SHIELD in this situation? Oh my god, I&rsquo;m basically Agent, guh, I&rsquo;m gonna be sick, JARVIS!&rdquo; He turned to Loki with wild eyes. &ldquo;I am really, really sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki stared at him. There was a warmth in his chest, a spreading feeling he barely recognised. When was the last time someone had apologised to him? Someone of consequence, not a servant or a subject - and even then, they would always do so with gritted teeth. Loki knew he was unpopular. He&rsquo;d never attempted to change that - it had always seemed so immutable a fact. Loki the trickster, don&rsquo;t trust him, don&rsquo;t listen, don&rsquo;t spend any time near him in case he turns you into a goat.</p><p>&ldquo;I would&hellip; I would like to stay,&rdquo; he said, and he tried to hide a wince at how vulnerable his voice sounded. &ldquo;I am interested in your science. In our differences.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Stark said, freezing in his distressed motions. &ldquo;Are you sure, though? You&rsquo;re not just saying that because I&rsquo;ve, like, activated some hospitality clause I didn&rsquo;t know about? You&rsquo;re choosing to&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am choosing, freely,&rdquo; he said, swallowing and looking up at Stark. &ldquo;If I am welcome, still?&rdquo;</p><p>Stark&rsquo;s face broke into a wide grin. &ldquo;Hell, yeah, you&rsquo;re welcome!&rdquo; He let out a long breath. &ldquo;Phew, god, that was awful!&rdquo;</p><p>Loki&rsquo;s lip quirked up. &ldquo;Why was it so awful?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what life&rsquo;s like on your planet or whatever, but we humans don&rsquo;t like coercing other people.&rdquo; He made a face. &ldquo;Well, the non-assholes don&rsquo;t. Yeah, actually, scrap that? <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t like coercing people. I can&rsquo;t talk for the rest of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki grinned. &ldquo;Your realm is not so different from mine, in that case. It sounds as if there are plenty of assholes in both.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, honestly, I probably count as one of the assholes most of the time.&rdquo; Tony shrugged. &ldquo;Hey, do you want to go down to the lab now? I can show you the bots, and we can find out what your alien biology looks like on my holos.&rdquo;</p><p>And just like that, Loki was reminded what he was, his freakish blue skin, the horns, the demonic red of his eyes. He held himself still, trying not to wince, trying not to react, for how could he explain <i>this?</i> He would just have to control his expressions, focus on the science. Because perhaps there would be something in Stark&rsquo;s &lsquo;lab&rsquo; which would help him to find his way back to his old - no, his <i>true</i> form.</p><p>But Stark stopped mid-sentence. &ldquo;No? What? What is it? We won&rsquo;t do anything you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he said, biting his bottom lip again.</p><p>Had he always been this obvious? No-one in Asgard would ever have noticed, but Stark had spotted his reticence at once - and Loki had been actively trying to hide it. Had his masks ever been as strong as he had believed? Or had nobody ever been truly looking? Loki stared at Stark, amazed at the perceptiveness of this small, sparkling mortal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious, Loki, we won&rsquo;t do anything you don&rsquo;t want to, OK?&rdquo; Stark said, holding his gaze. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything you don&rsquo;t like, we&rsquo;ll stop, no matter how far through the process we are, if there&rsquo;s anything you don&rsquo;t even like the look of, we won&rsquo;t do it. And of course, I&rsquo;ll put myself through everything you do - like, except for actually doing magic, &lsquo;cause I can&rsquo;t. Oh, and I can&rsquo;t go into an MRI because of this,&rdquo; he added, tapping the centre of his chest over the odd glow. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t have to do that either.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki searched his face for any hint of a trick, any lie, and found only compassion. He swallowed hard. &ldquo;I do not look like this,&rdquo; he said, his voice nothing more than a croak. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; not usually.&rdquo; He looked down at his hands, clenching them into fists and feeling the sharp, obsidian nails digging into his skin. &ldquo;I was Aesir - I <i>am</i> Aesir. I <i>must</i> be. But&hellip; during my brother&rsquo;s coronation, I just&hellip; this happened. I turned into this&hellip; this monster, and now&hellip; now my magic is different, cold&hellip;&rdquo; he took a deep, shuddering breath, the fear sending icy tendrils through every nerve. He looked at the table and gasped. Frost swirled out from every contact point with his skin, and he jerked his hands back in horror.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, it&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; Stark said, holding his hands out, placating the beast once more. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo; He took a deep breath. &ldquo;Hey, I know we said we didn&rsquo;t have to talk, but do you want to tell me about it? And then&hellip; maybe we can get you back to normal?&rdquo;</p><p>Tags from last chapter: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVcxTi_wzXtTCRLFA_lunBQ\">@aformingsiren</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2p4PS35VGR_I0LJpuVgtdQ\">@sketch953</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYGH8t3UpHi3YAF78b7zypg\">@massivelandthingdonkey</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIWGV7hOKbNku5FY50PxjvQ\">@angrysockpuppetnoises</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc6e-Tj4wz2R6l9GlobvxA\">@ultra-rare-pegacorn</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHpAxu2dqbuYt4I7avjFQ_Q\">@redramzi</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mctcfsck03U1Le1yg8Hy_lA\">@senpaiweird</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0MM1GZyJ2KF6Z9FJej-_IQ\">@giggling-breeze</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoc8LutC8fuGbQUgR13IBA\">@rarepair-collector</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXmiDAWzEdlexipT1XuilA\">@saturnjuice</a>, @kuree06 &lt;3</p>",

He lifted trembling hands to cover his face, and nearly screamed.</p>\n<p>He stumbled out of bed, his heart thumping, trying to get <i>away</i> from the vicious black claws, the blue skin that had haunted his nightmares since his childhood. He scratched at his arm, tore at the pale lines raised in the skin, whimpering and panicking, the quiet, calm voice inside now drowned out by the storm, and he couldn&rsquo;t find himself, couldn&rsquo;t dig himself out from under this hellish mask, this curse, this&hellip;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey! Hey, Loki, please, calm, will you? Hey, look at me? I&rsquo;m not going to touch you, alright? I just want you to look at the lights, can you do that? Can you breathe in with the light as it gets brighter? That&rsquo;s great, keep going&hellip; OK, and now out. Like you&rsquo;re whistling, purse your lips, yeah, just like that. Now in, feel it&hellip; feel it filling you up or&hellip; yeah, this is good. That&rsquo;s great, buddy. OK, I&rsquo;m just gonna&hellip; can I see your arms?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Stark came closer, still holding his hands out in front of him and looking as unthreatening as possible. Logically Loki could see that he was <i>very</i>unthreatening, a small mortal in soft clothing, hair still sleep-mussed and face pillow-creased, but with his heart still hammering inside his own chest, he couldn&rsquo;t handle logic at all. He tugged his arms closer to himself, fingers slick with his own blood.</p>\n<p>Then he looked down. The blood was indigo. He whimpered and pushed his arms out as far from himself as he could, staggering backwards, his breathing speeding up again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, it&rsquo;s OK! I&rsquo;ll get them fixed up, no worries.&rdquo; Stark cupped his hands around Loki&rsquo;s wrists, making a surprised hum. &ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re cold.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Loki let out a burst of hysterical laughter that very nearly turned into a sob. How utterly pathetic. To have been reduced to a scared child, cowering in someone else&rsquo;s room, terrified of his own appearance after a nightmare&hellip; Loki turned his face and closed his eyes. It was almost unbearable.</p>\n<p>Stark tugged him gently over to the bed, encouraging him to sit. He left him there, staring down helplessly, hatefully, at his blue, bleeding arms. &ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; Stark said a moment later, setting a bowl of water down by Loki&rsquo;s feet. He took Loki&rsquo;s wrist in his hand and started dabbing the blood away, staining the water an inky blue. Loki stared at the colour diffusing through the water and tried not to despair.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There we go,&rdquo; Stark said with a grin. Loki looked at his forearms, wrapped in pristine white bandages. He felt emptied out, like his heart had been excavated from his chest, leaving him dull and hollow. Stark&rsquo;s smile slowly slipped from his face and he bit his lip. &ldquo;Ah, do you&hellip; do you want to talk a bit?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Loki blinked at him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Like, uh&hellip; do you maybe want to&hellip; were you trying to, um. Were you <i>trying</i> to hurt yourself? Is this, like, a self-harm thing? Because I won&rsquo;t judge, I just&hellip;&rdquo; He scruffed his hair. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m not very good at this shit. Are you&hellip; OK?&rdquo; He winced and looked at Loki sideways, almost as if he thought Loki would strike him for his question.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, Stark,&rdquo; said Loki, his voice sounding very distant. &ldquo;I am not OK.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I kinda&hellip; got that.&rdquo; Stark sat on his haunches and rubbed his face. &ldquo;You know what? We need a load of breakfast. I&rsquo;m thinking pastries and donuts, something that won&rsquo;t go cold or soggy, and then I think you should tell me all about it. I mean, I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll be any help.&rdquo; He winced again. &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;ll probably be shit. Like, worse than nothing. I&rsquo;m not&hellip; the best listener. Or the best friend. But&hellip;&rdquo; he shrugged and looked away like he didn&rsquo;t care at all. &ldquo;Yeah, croissants! JARVIS, could you order us, eh, I dunno, one of everything from Belle Maison?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of course, Sir,&rdquo; JARVIS replied.</p>\n<p>Loki looked up in the direction of the voice.
