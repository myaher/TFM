        "body": "<p>Summary:</p><p>\n\n\u201cFear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man<b> inhuman</b>.\u201d<b>\u00a0</b>- Marian Anderson<br/>When Steve proposes to Tony, some of the homophobic Captain America fans come out of the woodwork with a lot to say. People do dangerous things when they fear what they don&rsquo;t understand, and apparently two men in love is just too spooky for them.\n\n<br/></p><!-- more --><p><b><br/></b>\t\u201cFear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.\u201d - Marian\u00a0Anderson</p><p>Steve Rogers often forgot that he wasn\u2019t just a man. Captain America was a symbol of hope and patriotism, and the man behind the mask was often put on a pedestal. The average american who didn\u2019t personally know him typically had their own distinct ideas about who Steve should be. Tony tried to make the man understand that, but he never wanted to listen.\t</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! They can think what they want but I know who I am, Tony, and I don\u2019t care if people like it,\u201d Steve shouted. The argument wasn\u2019t a new one, and his patience was beginning to wear thin. He understands that Tony\u2019s heart is in the right place, but the genius was not hearing his words.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Tony threw his hands up in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re Captain fucking America!\u201d He ignored Steve\u2019s muttered \u2018language.\u2019 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you care about the public opinion, the public will make themselves heard anyway. When people decide they hate something you do, they don\u2019t just say it, they riot. When they like what you do, they throw parades to celebrate.\u201d He sighed, the anger draining out of him, leaving only weariness. \u201cI wish I was wrong, you could cause a civil war just be saying the wrong thing, Steve. We can\u2019t be public.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>That was the crux of it all, wasn\u2019t it? Steve wanted the world to know how important Tony was to him, but Tony kept blocking his attempts to talk about their relationship to the press. Everytime a question about his love life came up, he would open his mouth to answer only for Tony to divert their attention with one of his latest scandals. Reporters would shout loudly over each other for a chance to get the great Tony Stark\u2019s comment on something controversial, and Steve\u2019s responses would be dead on his lips. Tonight was going to be the end of it. Steve had made sure of his plan. It didn\u2019t matter this time how much Tony tried to talk him out of it. The world would know about his feelings and his sexual orientation.\t</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 2018. Nobody is going to riot because Captain America is gay.\u201d Steve was done with this conversation. Tony\u2019s attitude was spoiling his good mood. \u201cI\u2019m going to go for a run. Be ready to leave at seven.\u201d He left the lab before Tony could say more. Pepper and the Avengers\u2019 PR agent had set up the interview on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> several months back. According to them, Kimmel wanted to talk to the two of them about being the Avengers\u2019 leaders, and how their different leadership styles meshed during missions. When Steve had called Kimmel\u2019s assistant with his idea last week, Jimmy himself had called him back to tell him it was a go.\t</p><p>\u201cThe audience will love it!\u201d Kimmel exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll throw it into the middle of the interview, so there\u2019s time for Mr. Stark\u2019s reaction to play out whatever it is. When I tell him that you wrote the next question, that\u2019ll be your cue. Oh, I\u2019m so excited! My show is going to be talked about for weeks!\u201d\t</p><p>Steve grinned into his phone. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful you\u2019re allowing it Mr. Kimmel, I\u2019m sorry to take away time from what you had planned.\u201d\t</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! This is way better than anything my writers could come up with!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Steve checked his hair in the mirror for the fifth time. He felt like a walking flag in his navy blue suit, with red tie and white shirt, but Pepper had brow beat him into wearing it. Tony was going to be wearing a gold tie with a deep red suit and shirt. Tony loved it, but Steve wished they didn\u2019t have to be so obviously mimicking their uniforms. It made him feel like they weren\u2019t allowed to be Steve and Tony, they were only allowed to be Captain America and Iron Man. He was reminded of his fear of being a dancing monkey that had began all the war back in WWII.\u00a0</p><p>The small black box in his pocket brought Steve back to the present. He patted the lump, taking a deep breath. He was<i> not </i>nervous. Tony was going to say yes. All Steve needed to do was ask. The question was really a formality; Steve and Tony had been promising each other eternity for awhile now. Tony wasn\u2019t ashamed of being with Steve. They were only a secret because Tony thought the public couldn\u2019t handle Steve being with a man. That was all. \u00a0The knock on the door forced him to give up on the internal pep talk.\t</p><p>\u201cSteve! Happy is waiting!\u201d\t</p><p>Steve opened the door where Tony was still knocking. He smiled down at his handsome boyfriend, stealing a kiss. The aroma of his aftershave burned Steve\u2019s nostrils a little. He loved it all the same. No matter how hard Tony tried, he\u2019d always have the slight smell of metal and oil clinging to him that Steve loved. \u201cLet\u2019s go, love.\u201d\t</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>Steve watched Tony answer another question and the rest of the room could\u2019ve disappeared for all he cared. When the billionaire really got going in an interview, his real personality would begin to bleed through the cocky public persona. His easy going responses put even the most rowdy reporters at ease and he expertly steered conversation to topics he was comfortable with. Growing up in the spotlight had shaped him into the perfect interviewee that Steve, with his awkward shyness, could never hope to be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c&hellip; So sure, we disagree now and again, but it never puts a mission in jeopardy. Cap will always defer to me on aerial combat, and I\u2019ll defer to him ground combat in the end,\u201d Tony finished his answer, smiling over at Steve. Steve resisted the urge to lean over for a kiss right then.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe next question is directed at you Mr. Stark, and it was actually written by Captain America himself!\u201d The applause erupted when Steve stood. Tony met his eyes, confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 he mouthed the words. Steve only gave him a nervous smile in response.\u00a0</p><p>As the applause died down, Steve realized he couldn\u2019t back out of this now. He got down on one knee, ignoring the way the audience began screaming in excitement. Steve was focused only on Tony\u2019s reactions. The brunette\u2019s confused look slowly morphed into a scarily blank face, but Steve could see the fear in the man\u2019s eyes mixed with anxious excitement. There was so much there in the brown eyes, and maybe this had been a horrible mistake. Steve held his breath as he pulled the little box out and opened it.\t</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart had stopped. He was certain of it. What was Steve thinking!? He felt dizzy, and oh yeah, maybe he needed to breathe. He took in a shaky breath. He couldn\u2019t even tell anymore if he was ecstatic or terrified. Of course he had wanted this, more than anyone could imagine, but Steve was not thinking this through. The right wing news was going to tear them to shreds tomorrow. A hush fell over the audience, and Tony could feel the people leaning forward on their seats in anticipation, but his own gaze was locked onto the kneeling blond.\u00a0\t</p><p>\u201cAnthony Edward Stark, will you marry me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony forgot his own very valid fears when the words hit him. Steve wanted to marry him! How many times had he dreamed about this very moment? The fact that they were on live television faded away and Tony needed to keep breathing. Steve\u2019s face was so hopeful and nervous, and that made Tony want to burst out laughing. Did the man honestly think Tony could ever say no to him? He cleared his throat. \u201cYes,\u201d it came out as a whisper. \u201cYes,\u201d he said louder this time. \u201cOf course, you idiot, now get up here.\u201d\t</p><p>Tony pulled the stupidly grinning Steve off his knees and into a kiss. The audience went wild and their host was saying something about happy couples and a commercial break, but all the two men cared about was each other. Tony swore he could feel Steve\u2019s heartbeat thrumming through him. Steve smiled against his lips, trying to pull back, but Tony clutched the man\u2019s jacket tight. Steve would not escape him that easily.\t</p><p>Kimmel clearing his throat startled them both back to reality. Steve blushed a deep scarlet that matched his tie, and Tony smirked at how swollen his lips looked. \u201cWhile I understand the sentiment, gentleman, we\u2019ll be back live in a two minutes. So maybe the ring shouldn\u2019t be on the floor?\u201d He pointed to the forgotten black box Steve had dropped.\u00a0</p><p>Steve snatched the box back up, slipping the ring onto Tony\u2019s finger. When they were back in their seats, much closer together on the couch now, Tony actually looked at the ring for the first time. It was a simple silver ring with a blue stone the colour of Steve\u2019s eyes. On close inspection, the band itself had an intricate design carved into it that made reminded Tony of a circuit board. It was too perfect, and Tony was grinning at it like a smitten schoolgirl when the band and applause indicated the end of the adbreak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, Mr. Stark, show the cameras your beautiful ring!\u201d Tony held up his hand as the camera zoomed in, wiggling his fingers excitedly. \u201cIt really is something, isn\u2019t it? Captain Rogers, where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>Steve squeezed Tony\u2019s other hand in his lap. \u201cI, uh, well, I got the stone from an antique store, but I made it.\u201d Tony gaped at his fianc\u00e9. When had the man found time?\t</p><p>\u201cOh, wow!\u201d Kimmel leaned back in his chair in clear surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I knew you could make jewelry. Is this something you\u2019ve done a lot?\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled. His elation had rid him of all his usual shyness. Tony had said yes! \u201cIt\u2019s my first attempt at jewelry, I\u2019ll admit. I\u2019m not very into metalworking, Tony being the metal expert I leave it to him, but I did go to art school before I enlisted. I know a thing or two about design and aesthetic.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! I forgot about the art school. I\u2019m a bit rusty on my 1940s Steve Rogers trivia, I\u2019ll admit. I did go to your exhibit at the museum once, though.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the interview went by in a blur for the two of them. Tony wanted nothing more than to get Steve out of those clothes so he could show him how much he really appreciated the proposal. While he wasn\u2019t necessarily against jumping the man on TV, public indecency was frowned upon and whatnot. When they got home, Tony couldn\u2019t even strip immediately like he wanted, because the Avengers were waiting with a banner and surprise party. Tony and Steve grinned their way through the congratulations, making sure they spent a proper amount of time enjoying the party, but they both just wanted to be alone.</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d Tony growled after he slammed their door shut. Steve had no complaints with the fervor, only helped Tony to strip them both down as quickly as possible. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that on television,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was husky with arousal. Steve allowed him to hold him down on the bed, just watching the smaller man kiss a line down his front before gasping in surprise when Tony nipped the inside of his thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>Steve huffed. He was too distracted by the sensation of Tony\u2019s hands on him to think clearly. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be complaining,\u201d he replied dizzily. Tony teased at his tip with his tongue, and Steve hissed. His hips bucked before he could stop them, but Tony smirked up at him, victorious. He had Steve at his mercy in five minutes tops every time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m not complaining,\u201d he murmured, crawling back up to silence Steve\u2019s moan with his own mouth as he wrapped a hand around Steve\u2019s penis. He gave a lazy stroke, impressed with how quickly Steve could be so hard. He began sucking at Steve\u2019s neck, pulling his hand away to scratch ten red lines up Steve\u2019s abs and chest. The air hitting the raw skin was a perfect contrast to the moist warmth of Tony\u2019s mouth on Steve\u2019s neck. Tony pulled back to look down at Steve from above. His pupils were blown wide and Steve thought he had never looked more beautiful. \u201cYou are insane, though,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was strained, his own erection untouched so far. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to leave the tower for weeks without being harassed by reporters.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve ignored Tony\u2019s hand this time when he tried to block Steve from grabbing him. He felt Tony twitch eagerly in his grasp as he watched Tony throw his head back with a moan. Tony\u2019s sounds were always the best part for Steve. The man could make the most obscene noises, and it was the only time Steve could make him fumble his words. Steve reached into the drawer beside him, pulling out the lube. \u201cI really don\u2019t care,\u201d Steve responded before sticking a slicked finger inside his new fianc\u00e9. He grinned when Tony whined and pushed down onto the finger, already begging for more.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>Tony had been predictably correct. The next morning, every news station across TV and radio was talking about Captain America\u2019s engagement to Iron Man. Steve decided his morning run was not worth it when he saw the crowd waiting right outside the tower. He decided to ignore Tony\u2019s \u2018I told you so\u2019 smug face when he returned from the lobby and headed to the gym to use the treadmill. Tony was still in the kitchen watching another news channel an hour later.</p><p>Steve walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around Tony, who leaned back for a kiss. \u201cHow was your run?\u201d he smirked up at Steve.</p><p>Steve merely returned the smirk. \u201cStill worth it,\u201d he kissed Tony again, savoring the coffee taste. Tony returned to the news on the tablet in front of him, holding out his empty mug towards Steve. Steve shook his head fondly as he refilled the coffee before moving to make his second breakfast. \u201cHave you eaten anything today?\u201d he called behind his shoulder.</p><p>Tony only hummed in response, too focused on whatever the reporter was saying in front of him to actually listen to what Steve had asked. Steve couldn\u2019t hear anything, so the captions must be on. He gave up and decided to make Tony some food anyway, since he likely hadn\u2019t had anything besides coffee. If he didn\u2019t eat it, Clint certainly always would, so it\u2019d hardly go to waste. Tony let out a frustrated growl behind him. \u201cTony,\u201d he sighed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ignore them? That\u2019s what you normally do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d He finished his coffee and set it on the counter a little too hard. \u201cI\u2019m used to the things they say about me, but now they\u2019re saying horrible things about you! Well, mostly me still and how I must have duped you or am a bad influence but still! Fox is saying you\u2019ve betrayed you values,\u201d he looked to see why Steve had stopped making cooking noises. The blond looked much angrier than Tony was expecting. He had seem so unperturbed by it all only a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cThey said that you duped me?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was low and dangerous. \u201cThat you influence me negatively!?\u201d It rose to a near shout. Tony flinched instinctively, not used to Steve\u2019s actually angry voice in the close quarters of the small kitchen. Steve lowered his voice again, annoyed that he had made Tony flinch. \u201cJARVIS, call Anne and have her come over today if she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight on it, Captain Rogers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony gaped at the man, lost. \u201cWhy are you talking to PR? I thought the plan was to ignore them until they moved onto the next big story?\u201d He watched Steve war with himself, his face twitching with conflicting emotions. He moved forward, turned off the stovetop before Steve burned his food, and grabbed Steve\u2019s hands from underneath his crossed arms. Steve watched their hands for a moment, before meeting Tony\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat is bothering you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he reopened them he looked much calmer. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. JARVIS, can you cancel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the idea that I\u2019m somehow better than you I guess. Like why not ask if I was the one who duped you?\u201d Steve looked so sad and confused, Tony felt so heartless for the laugh that slipped past his lips unwanted. Steve pulled his hands away, irritated.</p><p>\u201cWait, no, sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to laugh,\u201d Tony started. Steve had turned back to cooking, though, and wasn\u2019t looking at Tony. \u201cSteve, please.\u201d</p><p>Steve kept cooking. \u201cGo on Tony,\u201d he said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, the idea of you duping me was really funny to me, I didn\u2019t mean to actually laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the idea of me duping you is fine?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Tony felt like he had walked into some sort of trap. That there was a wrong answer here. Maybe he should work around the question rather than answering directly. \u201cWell if one of us were better than the other, you\u2019re clearly the better one.\u201d That was the wrong answer. All of Steve\u2019s movements became sharp and harsh, slamming plates down and dumping food on them messily before throwing utensils in the sink. The clamour seemed to solidify that Tony had fucked up.\u00a0</p><p>Steve sat down at the counter, so Tony took his own seat warily. They ate in tense silence for several long minutes before Steve looked up at him again. He looked sad instead of angry. \u201cYou believe that don\u2019t you?\u201d Tony ran through the conversation again, not sure what was being asked. \u201cThat I\u2019m better than you. That you duped me.\u201d The questions had become statements.\u00a0</p><p>Tony felt like an idiot for not realizing what was bothering the man earlier. Of course it was because he thought they were equals. Tony and the rest of the world knew that Steve was a better person, but Steve had come to believe that Tony was as good as himself. Tony wasn\u2019t complaining, but he knew it wasn\u2019t true. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he spoke sincerely. He couldn\u2019t lie and tell Steve that he was wrong, but he could apologize for it.</p><p>Steve took Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you are.\u201d He kissed Tony on the forehead. \u201cI love you so much, and I will make you believe that you deserve me someday.\u201d Tony threw him a lopsided smile. He would love that to happen.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>By the time the Stark Industries Halloween Gala rolled around a few months later, the stories about Steve and Tony had died down. Here and there a piece would show up offering someone\u2019s opinion on the matter, but everyone had moved onto more important things for the most part. Like what the two engaged superheroes would be wearing to the Gala.</p><p>\u201cI really think you could pull off a dress, shellhead,\u201d Clint said at dinner that night. Thor had brought a tabloid magazine to the table with an article speculating about their attire. \u201cThen maybe the conservatives will be a little happier about Steve\u2019s gayness if you\u2019re the feminine one.\u201d\u00a0The rest of the Avengers had found the whole debacle immensely amusing. Clint especially loved to poke fun at the stories where Tony was an evil seducer that turned Captain America gay.\u00a0</p><p>Tony pretended to think about it. \u201cI suppose I could really piss them all off by shaving and wearing a wig. Though that may offend the drag or trans communities. I\u2019ve always wanted to get into drag, though. Imagine me, a drag queen. Iron maiden, I could be a dominatrix-esque drag queen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I would love to help you come up with routines!\u201d Thor enthused. It may or may not actually be one of Tony\u2019s secret dreams, but he knew he\u2019d never be able to get into it without a media shit-storm claiming he was trying to poke fun or was a bigot. Really, he wasn\u2019t sure where the idea had come about that Tony would be conservative or right-wing was beyond him. His dad may have been a capitalist douche bag, but even Howard had thought being anti-LGBTQ+ was just plain stupid. Like who cares what people do in their private lives? If it\u2019s not hurting anyone\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never realized how much I wanted to see you in drag,\u201d Natasha commented, eyeing him intensely. \u201cAnd I see Steve is on the same page,\u201d she glanced over at the blushing man, only causing his blush to deepen.\u00a0</p><p>Tony spit out his drink. \u201cWait, Steve, is it true?\u201d He turned to look at his fianc\u00e9 excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, well, I, uhm,\u201d he spluttered. \u201cI would want you to keep the goatee!\u201d he blurted out. Tony could not have found a more adorable man to marry. He pulled Steve in for a kiss, that quickly turned a bit too sexually charged for the dinner table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, God, get a room!\u201d Clint flung some peas at Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Tony ignored the projectiles, but pulled away nonetheless. \u201cI can dress in drag for you,\u201d he whispered in Steve\u2019s ear before going back to his dinner as though nothing had happened. Steve might just pass out from how red he was getting. Tony tried to keep his expression innocent, only grinning in victory inside his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have come up with a few outfit pairs for you, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Coulson spoke, dry as always, so Tony couldn\u2019t tell if he was serious. The way Clint whipped around in surprise told him that Coulson wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cI worked on it with Darcy,\u201d he said with a shrug as though that explained anything at all.\u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t deny that he was curious. \u201cI\u2019d love to see them,\u201d he told Coulson, happy to change the subject from Tony in drag. Not even he had known he wanted that until the picture had popped into his head. \u201cThe Gala is masquerade though, right?\u201d Steve turned to look at Tony.</p><p>Tony nodded. \u201cYeah, although most people only have their masks on in the beginning for pictures.\u201d He scrunched up his nose. \u201cThey get weirdly sweaty.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m adding you to our google doc, Cap,\u201d Phil said while he typed on his phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo I have to go?\u201d Bruce asked from the other end of the table? \u201cI know we were all invited, but I hate these things.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned at his best friend. \u201cWell I can hardly force you, but it\u2019d look better if the Avengers all showed up so the press doesn\u2019t come up with some stupid theory like that we\u2019re not getting along or something. Knowing them they might decide you hate that Steve and I are together. I\u2019ve seen some hilarious fan theories that you\u2019re jealous because you and me were meant to be,\u201d Tony snorted.</p><p>Bruce\u2019s cheeks turned pink. \u201cYou and me? You\u2019re not really my type.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, right!?\u201d Tony was still laughing hysterically. \u201cSo you\u2019ll come?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Bruce nodded in defeat, \u201cIf it\u2019ll keep them from theorizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>They ended up on tuxes with each other\u2019s usual colour schemes. Tony wore a light blue vest, with matching pinstripes on his pants. The tux jacket and bowtie were black with a blue shimmer that you could see only when the light hit it right. He thought it looked perfect with his engagement ring, and he used one of those blue tinted mascaras to accentuate his naturally long lashes. Now that he knew Steve had a thing for it, he finally had an excuse to start exploring some of the more feminine parts of vanity he\u2019d always wanted to, but he\u2019d start slow. There was the public to consider, of course.</p><p>Steve wore a maroon vest with a black tux, and his bow tie matched the vest. The best part, in Tony\u2019s opinion, was the gold glittery shimmer that was over the whole tux set. Tony wasn\u2019t sure how his designer friend, Janet Van Dyne, had done it, but it looked like someone had very lightly sprayed the whole thing with gold glitter spray paint. Steve\u2019s mask was an arc-reactor blue, as he called it, feathered along one side with gold feathers. Tony\u2019s was a phantom of the opera half face style white, with a red and blue gradient of tiny, sparkly stars along the outer edge. Together they looked simultaneously gorgeous and ridiculous.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did I get such a handsome fianc\u00e9?\u201d Steve asked in wonder as they headed out for the limo, already assaulted by paparazzi. The security detail for the Avengers was being handled by SHIELD and SI together given the amount of super-powered enemies they had all acquired over the years. Tony had the bracelets to call the suit if needed, Steve had the shield waiting at the gala in a closet, Clint had his foldable bow with arrows stored next to Steve\u2019s shield, Thor was always able to call Mjolnir, and Phil and Natasha were strapped with handguns and knives.</p><p>Tony grinned, waving at a couple of photographers happily. \u201cBy being a sweet, sensitive artist who throws a disc at nazis and aliens,\u201d he answered without missing a beat. Steve\u2019s resulting laugh sounded musical to his ears. He felt like he was walking on air tonight. This was their first formal public event since the engagement, and though they\u2019d of course gone on dates and missions together since, he felt like this was his first real opportunity to show off his fianc\u00e9. There was a slightly bitter thought in the back of his mind that he\u2019d like to see Howard\u2019s stupid face when he found out his beloved perfect Steve was marrying his failure son Tony, but he easily pushed it away. Steve was going to marry him, had announced it publicly, his life was perfect.\u00a0</p><p>When they arrived and stepped out of the limo, there were not only photographers, but reporters too. They stopped off to one side to answer a few questions before they got in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCaptain America, what do you say to the family values activists who say you\u2019ve gone over to the dark side and should be stripped of your title?\u201d A woman from the back shouted.</p><p>Steve took it in stride. Tony had been practicing with him for months, so he\u2019d be prepared for far worse questions than this. \u201cI say that I am sorry they are so frightened by what they don\u2019t understand. Just because a man loving another man is different than their own love lives does not make their idea of a family more valid than LGBTQ+ families, and their self-appointed cause of family values is a misguided bigotry.\u201d</p><p>Tony was so proud. \u201cDo you honestly think they\u2019re afraid of gays or is it maybe that they just hate them?\u201d A man nearby asked. Tony leaned over to whisper in Steve\u2019s ear that it was Ian Gerund, a reporter for <i>Out Magazine</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked the man in the eyes the whole time he responded, which obviously made the man a little uncomfortable. Reporters were not used to such directness with their shouted questions, as Tony had warned him. \u201cI do honestly think that. I also think there is some genuine hate out there. Hate often stems from fear, though, and as Marian Anderson, one of my favourite singers said, \u2018Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.\u2019 Our only hope is to continue to meet hate and fear with love and acceptance, but defend ourselves when attacked.\u201dThe reporters nearby had clearly not been prepared for such well thought out responses, and there was a small wave of confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark! Are you really ready to be sexually exclusive with one person \u2018til death do you part?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t help the painful tightening of his hand around Tony\u2019s. The questions directed at them were so different and obviously judgmental about the two of them and it pissed him off. Everyone was prepared for Steve to be an innocent backwards old man and for Tony to be a promiscuous conniving bastard. Tony, on the other hand, was used to it. He shot the offending reporter a wicked grin. \u201cOh, Steve is plenty sexually fulfilling to me, sweet-cheeks. Sorry you missed out on your opportunity,\u201d he finished with a wink. Steve thought that was a perfect time to leave.</p><p>\u201cSorry folks, we have people to see and dances to dance,\u201d Steve said, strained. He tugged on Tony\u2019s hand, but the man had no qualms about following anyway. He hated talking to reporters as much as Steve did. He just hid it better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did so well, babe.\u201d He pulled Steve\u2019s hands to his lips, kissing the knuckles. \u201cProud of you.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled at him, but his eyes were a little pinched. \u201cYeah, thanks for the practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, love. They\u2019ll eventually stop treating you like that. It\u2019s just hard for some people to recognize that not everyone in the 40s was straight and hated gays,\u201d Tony spoke quietly, misunderstanding the reason for the distress.</p><p>Steve kissed him, which conveniently gave him the excuse to be right at Tony\u2019s eye level as he said, \u201cI could care less how they treat me. It\u2019s how they treat you like an amoral, selfish party-boy who is going to cheat on me first chance he gets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I was for a long time,\u201d Tony reminded him. Steve didn\u2019t have a chance to respond before the greetings and small talk of the night began.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark! Captain Rogers! So good to see you.\u201d Steve didn\u2019t recognize the man, though Tony seemed to. Sometimes it seemed to Steve that Tony knew everyone in New York, though. \u201cIt really is a lovely event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Germaine, thank you for coming. I don\u2019t believe you two have actually met, this is Captain Steve Rogers, my fianc\u00e9,\u201d he used the title feeling giddy. \u201cSteve, this is Lt. Frances Germaine. We met while I was working on the Stylus project, right?\u201d</p><p>Lt. Germaine nodded. \u201cYou were showing us your new remote controls for a drone that allowed more precise aim and birdseye view so there\u2019d be less accidental civilian casualties,\u201d he reminded Tony.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh yes, hope that worked out,\u201d Tony remarked. \u201cIt was a little before Afghanistan when I was still designing while wasted so,\u201d he shrugged with his most self-deprecating smile.\u00a0</p><p>Steve frowned at Tony, but Germaine gave a knowing chuckle. \u201cIt saved numerous lives from unnecessary accidents, I assure you,\u201d he placed a comforting hand on the genius\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYou really weren\u2019t the devil people made you out to be, y\u2019know. The wake up call about SI accountability and double-dealing was important, but you should cut yourself some slack. Even as a kid you were doing good work.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave a strained smile. \u201cThanks, Lieutenant. I hope you enjoy the party.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The man caught on to the dismissal. \u201cNice to meet you, Captain.\u201d They shook hands and he departed. Tony snagged a three drinks off a roaming tray and handed one to Steve. He drained one, placing it back on the tray, and kept the other.</p><p>Before Steve could comment on the conversation that had just happened, he heard the familiar gleeful squeal of Janet. \u201cOh, boys, you look fabulous! Give me a little spin,\u201d she motioned. They obeyed, laughing. \u201cYes! Perfect! The coattails had me worried there for you Cap, your proportions are wonky. Didn\u2019t want them to look too short. Oh! Tony, darling, I haven\u2019t seen the ring in person, gimme,\u201d she held out her hand expectantly.</p><p>Tony was laughing and enjoying himself again, previous conversation with the Lieutenant long forgotten. He handed the ring over and the two started gushing about Steve\u2019s taste. Steve was still thinking about the previous conversation, so he was a little startled when the two of them were looking at him expectantly. \u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><p>Janet burst out laughing. \u201cI asked you how long it took you to make the ring?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve blushed, embarrassed. \u201cOh, only like a week after I found the right stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how long before that have you been planning to ask me?\u201d Tony asked, hand on his hip. He only got even sassier around Janet. The two together could be a nightmare sometimes. When Tony, Janet, and Clint were all three in a room, one\u2019s only hope was to flee before you got caught in their whirlwind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTwo years?\u201d Steve answered hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThat was before we had even started dating!!!\u201d Tony exclaimed.\u00a0</p><p>Steve scratched at the back of his head, not having a good response for this. He had kind of been hoping it would never cross Tony\u2019s mind to ask. \u201cYeah, I may have been in love with you and overly optimistic for a long time before we confessed to each other,\u201d he attempted to explain.</p><p>\u201cThat is the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Janet remarked. Tony just looked at him with wide eyes, feeling like he was falling in love with Steve all over again. This man was far better than he could have ever dreamed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Janet, your outfits are lovely and we need to get together soon and catch up,\u201d Tony started without looking away from Steve, \u201cbut I need to take this man to the dancefloor, <i>now</i>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I understand,\u201d Janet responded too seriously. \u201cGet on with it!\u201d She faux whispered to Steve while he was led away by Tony.</p><p>They danced to a song Steve didn\u2019t recognize, but it hardly mattered. He only had eyes for Tony and followed the man\u2019s lead. Tony had been taught to dance when he was three and it more than made up for Steve\u2019s two left feet. Tony finished his drink so he could use two hands again, placing it on the passing waiter\u2019s tray. He frowned at Steve\u2019s untouched drink before snatching it, draining it, and also placing it on said waiter\u2019s tray. The waiter scowled before he walked away. Had that been the same one as before?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had three drinks already and this is only our first dance,\u201d Steve remarked lightly. He wasn\u2019t worried. Tony hadn\u2019t gotten too drunk since they\u2019d gotten engaged. The genius seemed to only get past buzzed when he was upset or depressed.\u00a0</p><p>Tony waved him off. \u201cThree drinks is nothing for me, you know that,\u201d he smiled brightly. He wasn\u2019t wrong. Tony often didn\u2019t feel anything until the fifth drink depending on the strength, and these were just glasses of champagne. He typically drank straight liquor. \u201cI wish they\u2019d play something slower,\u201d he said casually, pulling Steve into him.</p><p>It was like it was planned, and maybe it was, Steve thought. This was a SI organized party afterall. The music shifted to a slow song, and it took Steve a until the vocals to realize it was. \u201cIs this-?\u201d he felt at a loss for words. He had never mentioned his love for Marian Anderson before.\u00a0</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips quirked sideways, a cross between a smile and a nervous squint. \u201c<i>Solitude</i>, or <i>The Jewish Girl\u2019s Song </i>as performed by Marian Anderson? Yes.\u201d</p><p>Steve felt his eyes well up with tears. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d He asked softly. Tony was up against him, head resting against Steve\u2019s chest as they slowly danced to the movement of Marian\u2019s voice. The orchestral part didn\u2019t move much, so it made more sense to set one\u2019s movements to the woman\u2019s emotional performance. Tony waited until the song finished to answer Steve\u2019s question. Steve vaguely realized that the rest of the large ballroom was full of people confused by the sudden change in language and style, but it didn\u2019t matter. They\u2019d get over it when the regular modern music returned.</p><p>\u201cWell, I may have been playing different artists in the background when you\u2019re around and gauging your reactions with JARVIS\u2019 help. We eventually narrowed down your best unconscious smiles to music that style-wise and time period led to Marian Anderson, so I figured she must be one of your faves, and then you quoted her outside and I\u2019m so glad I wasn\u2019t wrong, because sometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out what you liked from your old life and-\u201d the man was rambling nervously, and they both knew it.\u00a0</p><p>Steve placed a finger to his lips, silencing the man. \u201cEverytime I think you\u2019re done surprising me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou blow away my expectations again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony absolutely beamed at him. It had been a very long and difficult project, trying to figure out some of Steve\u2019s interests. The man was so easygoing and not picky sometimes that it was impossible to tell what he actually liked and what he just didn\u2019t mind. Tony wished Steve was a little more outspoken, but he also appreciated the little mysteries he had to work to solve about Steve. It kept the man interesting. His next project was trying to figure out the supersoldier\u2019s favourite painters and art styles for a wedding portrait, but that was still a secret. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you like it. I bought the film for the original recording of her performance at the Lincoln Memorial,\u201d Tony was actually blushing a little. He very rarely blushed. His olive italian complexion made it harder to show than Steve\u2019s pale irish white, but he also didn\u2019t have much shame anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Steve gasped in surprise, pulling Tony into him and holding on tight for a moment. The mention thrust him back to 1939 when the historic performance had been the talk of the nation. Marian had been such a big deal, paving the way for African American singers, and she got to sing at the Lincoln Memorial. Steve\u2019s mother had followed the woman\u2019s career closely, always reminding Steve that until the blacks were treated right, the immigrants had no hope. She had died only months before the Lincoln Memorial performance. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The rest of the night seemed to be going by in the background. Steve just followed his partner\u2019s lead, making small talk here and there, dancing, clapping, showing off their relationship, etc. Something at the back of his mind was bothering him, but he couldn\u2019t quite place it, so he pushed it aside and focused on Tony. The billionaire was in his element, as much as he was loathe to admit it. Tony Stark was a socialite as well as a shut-in engineer. Tony liked to convince himself that the rich celebrity persona was all a facade, and a lot of it was, but Steve could tell that the man also felt at home at these events sometimes. Now if the world worked Tony\u2019s way, there\u2019d only be one or two events a year, but if all of them suddenly disappeared, Steve thought Tony would probably miss it more than he expected.</p><p>It was when Tony placed his sixth empty champagne glass on a tray behind him that Steve realized what was bothering him. Out of the thirty or so roaming servers in the room, the same one always seemed to gravitate towards them. Tony had only come in contact with the one waiter, though he probably didn\u2019t notice at all. At first, it could\u2019ve been explained away by the staff having assigned areas of the room. By now, though, Steve and Tony had been all over the large hall, Tony being one of the main draws of the event. They had to talk to all the big SI contributors.</p><p>Tony\u2019s energy had been flagging over the last hour. He had gone from looking excited and flamboyant to looking tired and withdrawn. Steve caught him wiping a sweaty brow a few times, but until now, had only assumed it was due to the running around in a tux in a fairly hot room. No one else seemed to be sweating though. \u201cHey, wait up!\u201d Steve called out, jogging after the man until he caught up with the waiter. Tony watched him go in confusion, but stayed where he was, not wanting to seem rude while he was still trapped in conversation with one of the major shareholders in his company.\u00a0</p><p>The waiter turned to face Steve, mild surprise on his face. He looked so nondescript. An average height white male, light brown hair, probably middle aged. It was a wonder Steve had recognized him as familiar at all. That was one of Phil\u2019s assets as a SHIELD agent, looking nondescript. Steve idly wondered if being around nondescript agents enough to get to know them helped him be better at picking up on nuances within the average appearance. The man smiled politely. \u201cMay I help you with something, Captain Rogers?\u201d</p><p>Steve watched his expressions carefully. If there was anything suspicious about the man, he was good at hiding it. \u201cHave you been following us?\u201d he asked right out.</p><p>The waiter\u2019s face showed a split-second of surprise before returning to the polite smile.\u00a0Steve probably wouldn\u2019t have caught it if it weren\u2019t for Natasha\u2019s training in microexpressions. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d he pretended to be confused. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t know what set off his alarm bells, but he was sure enough of himself to be okay with making a scene. He snatched the tray from the man\u2019s hands and placed it on a nearby table. People close by started watching the strange exchange. Steve then grabbed the man\u2019s arm and twisted it painfully behind his back. \u201cDon\u2019t play stupid.\u201d He hissed into the man\u2019s ear.</p><p>A hysterical giggle tumbled from the waiter\u2019s lips. \u201cYour observational skills are as impressive as I expected,\u201d the man responded smugly. \u201cI only worry it took you too long.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound worried at all. Steve decided then and there that he hated the smug bastard.\u00a0</p><p>Slamming the man onto the same nearby table where he hat set the tray, Steve sent several glasses flying off the table or rolling and smashing loudly on the ground. A woman somewhere screamed. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cSteve! What are you doing!?\u201d Tony was marching towards them with two guards.</p><p>Steve took a steadying breath through his nose. \u201cThis man did something, Tony, I just don\u2019t know what,\u201d Steve grit out angrily. The man smirked at Steve. He was asking to get his nose broken.</p><p>Tony just looked more confused and irritated. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Let the man go, Steve.\u201d Tony placed a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but if this guy did do something, let security handle it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked back and forth between the smug bastard and his love, ignoring the awkward silence that had descended on the party while the drama unfolded. Tony was right, he didn\u2019t know what had gotten into him. He stood, pushing the waiter towards one of the guards, who caught the stumbling man easily and pinned his arms behind his back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what came over me,\u201d he murmured, head down. He had almost certainly ruined the party, and had definitely embarrassed Tony in front of the business world.\u00a0</p><p>When Tony didn\u2019t respond, he raised his head so he could see the man\u2019s expression. He was beginning to look very pale, and a bead of sweat ran down the un-masked side of his face. It seemed like a weird time for Steve to notice that they had never removed their masks like Tony said he normally did, but Steve\u2019s mind was all over the place. He stepped towards the man, \u201cTony?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time it kicked in,\u201d the smug asshole called out, and Tony turned slowly towards him, looking shocked and confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWha?\u201d Tony stepped towards him but stumbled, and Steve had to lunge to catch him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>Everyone was watching the scene unfold. Tony was in his arms looking dazed, breathing too quickly. Steve looked back at the asshole, and when they met eyes the man spoke again. \u201cHe was the problem, see? Now you can be Captain America again, unsoiled!\u201d There was a mad glint to the man\u2019s eyes. The guard holding him began dragging him away so they could question him in private. Pepper was approaching from the other direction with medics on either side of her.</p><p>Steve looked down again, terror beginning to take its icy hold on his heart. \u201cTony? Sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up at him, scared himself.\u00a0\u201cSteve? I-\u201d he shuddered in Steve\u2019s arms. \u201cI don\u2019t feel well.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d he tried to sound convincing as he laid the man on the ground for the medics to take over and examine. He stayed as close as he could so Tony could still see him. It was clear that panic was starting to take over for Tony though, and he reached out for Steve. His chest was heaving visibly.\u00a0</p><p>Steve grabbed one of the glasses he knew Tony had drank from, more thankful than he\u2019d ever been for his eidetic memory. \u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019ll be on this,\u201d he showed the medic who wasn\u2019t currently taking Tony\u2019s pulse.</p><p>\u201cGood, bring it with you,\u201d the medic commanded. \u201cWe gotta go, now.\u201d</p><p>Another two had arrived with a stretcher and they were lifting Tony onto it. Steve followed beside them, holding Tony\u2019s outstretched hand. Tony looked like he was about to say something, but instead cried out in pain and clutched at his abdomen. His breathing remained labored all the way to the helicopter, where it stopped altogether. Steve was gently pushed into a seat while they started manually inflating Tony\u2019s lungs, and Steve\u2019s world was spinning. Tony \u00a0was writhing in pain, still semi-conscious and all Steve could do was watch helplessly. When they landed at the hospital, Steve tried to stand and follow, but his knees locked in place and he was so dizzy.\u00a0</p><p>A nurse was there at his side, and when had he laid down on the ground. \u201cHey, you\u2019re okay, it\u2019s just emotional shock. Let\u2019s get you a blanket and some water, okay?\u201d The man in scrubs said. Steve nodded, allowing the man to help him into shaky legs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d he asked, hoping the guy new what he meant.\u00a0</p><p>Thankfully, he did. \u201cYou fianc\u00e9 is being taken care of right now. Thankfully, we were able to determine the poison pretty quickly with his symptoms and the residue on the glass. We\u2019re starting him on chelation. As long as he holds out a little longer, he\u2019ll make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p><i>As long as he holds out</i> is what stuck in Steve\u2019s mind. So there was still a chance Tony could die. \u201cI need to be there,\u201d he ground out, lurching forward from the chair he had been sat in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the nurse caught his arm. \u201cOkay, okay, let me take you there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve let him lead the way, and they were to Tony\u2019s bed where an IV was still being put in his arm, and the man was already intubated. Steve collapsed unceremoniously into the seat beside Tony opposite to the side the nurse was on, grabbing Tony\u2019s hand. He squeezed just tight enough to let Tony know he was there, that Tony had to pull through. The words he had spoken earlier that night were running through his head on repeat and he felt sick. <i>Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.</i>\u00a0</p><p>How could someone do something like this to someone like Tony? All in the name of \u00a0him being Captain America, \u2018unsoiled\u2019? The idea of Steve being with another man was so frightful to someone that they\u2019d poison Iron Man just to stop it? It was completely illogical and \u00a0crazy, but that was the point. Steve was terrified in this very moment, and it was coupled with a rage and illogical desire to beat the waiter to death. Such violence wouldn\u2019t help Tony survive, and it would do zero good for the world, but the idea of it alone helped assuage some of Steve\u2019s fear. Fear could truly turn the gentlest of men to inhumane acts. It shouldn\u2019t have been such a surprise to Steve, he had already seen it played out in the war, but the shock of it was real everytime he faced that reality. Tony would be okay, he had to be, but Steve would be haunted by this forever.</p>",

People do dangerous things when they fear what they don\u2019t understand, and apparently two men in love is just too spooky for them.\n\n<br></p>[[MORE]]<p><b><br></b>\t\u201cFear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.\u201d - Marian\u00a0Anderson</p><p>Steve Rogers often forgot that he wasn\u2019t just a man. Captain America was a symbol of hope and patriotism, and the man behind the mask was often put on a pedestal. The average american who didn\u2019t personally know him typically had their own distinct ideas about who Steve should be. Tony tried to make the man understand that, but he never wanted to listen.\t</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! They can think what they want but I know who I am, Tony, and I don\u2019t care if people like it,\u201d Steve shouted. The argument wasn\u2019t a new one, and his patience was beginning to wear thin. He understands that Tony\u2019s heart is in the right place, but the genius was not hearing his words.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Tony threw his hands up in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re Captain fucking America!\u201d He ignored Steve\u2019s muttered \u2018language.\u2019 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you care about the public opinion, the public will make themselves heard anyway. When people decide they hate something you do, they don\u2019t just say it, they riot. When they like what you do, they throw parades to celebrate.\u201d He sighed, the anger draining out of him, leaving only weariness. \u201cI wish I was wrong, you could cause a civil war just be saying the wrong thing, Steve. We can\u2019t be public.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>That was the crux of it all, wasn\u2019t it? Steve wanted the world to know how important Tony was to him, but Tony kept blocking his attempts to talk about their relationship to the press. Everytime a question about his love life came up, he would open his mouth to answer only for Tony to divert their attention with one of his latest scandals. Reporters would shout loudly over each other for a chance to get the great Tony Stark\u2019s comment on something controversial, and Steve\u2019s responses would be dead on his lips. Tonight was going to be the end of it. Steve had made sure of his plan. It didn\u2019t matter this time how much Tony tried to talk him out of it. The world would know about his feelings and his sexual orientation.\t</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 2018. Nobody is going to riot because Captain America is gay.\u201d Steve was done with this conversation. Tony\u2019s attitude was spoiling his good mood. \u201cI\u2019m going to go for a run. Be ready to leave at seven.\u201d He left the lab before Tony could say more. Pepper and the Avengers\u2019 PR agent had set up the interview on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> several months back. According to them, Kimmel wanted to talk to the two of them about being the Avengers\u2019 leaders, and how their different leadership styles meshed during missions. When Steve had called Kimmel\u2019s assistant with his idea last week, Jimmy himself had called him back to tell him it was a go.\t</p><p>\u201cThe audience will love it!\u201d Kimmel exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll throw it into the middle of the interview, so there\u2019s time for Mr. Stark\u2019s reaction to play out whatever it is. When I tell him that you wrote the next question, that\u2019ll be your cue. Oh, I\u2019m so excited! My show is going to be talked about for weeks!\u201d\t</p><p>Steve grinned into his phone. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful you\u2019re allowing it Mr. Kimmel, I\u2019m sorry to take away time from what you had planned.\u201d\t</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! This is way better than anything my writers could come up with!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Steve checked his hair in the mirror for the fifth time. He felt like a walking flag in his navy blue suit, with red tie and white shirt, but Pepper had brow beat him into wearing it. Tony was going to be wearing a gold tie with a deep red suit and shirt. Tony loved it, but Steve wished they didn\u2019t have to be so obviously mimicking their uniforms. It made him feel like they weren\u2019t allowed to be Steve and Tony, they were only allowed to be Captain America and Iron Man. He was reminded of his fear of being a dancing monkey that had began all the war back in WWII.\u00a0</p><p>The small black box in his pocket brought Steve back to the present. He patted the lump, taking a deep breath. He was<i> not </i>nervous. Tony was going to say yes. All Steve needed to do was ask. The question was really a formality; Steve and Tony had been promising each other eternity for awhile now. Tony wasn\u2019t ashamed of being with Steve. They were only a secret because Tony thought the public couldn\u2019t handle Steve being with a man. That was all. \u00a0The knock on the door forced him to give up on the internal pep talk.\t</p><p>\u201cSteve! Happy is waiting!\u201d\t</p><p>Steve opened the door where Tony was still knocking. He smiled down at his handsome boyfriend, stealing a kiss. The aroma of his aftershave burned Steve\u2019s nostrils a little. He loved it all the same. No matter how hard Tony tried, he\u2019d always have the slight smell of metal and oil clinging to him that Steve loved. \u201cLet\u2019s go, love.\u201d\t</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>Steve watched Tony answer another question and the rest of the room could\u2019ve disappeared for all he cared. When the billionaire really got going in an interview, his real personality would begin to bleed through the cocky public persona. His easy going responses put even the most rowdy reporters at ease and he expertly steered conversation to topics he was comfortable with. Growing up in the spotlight had shaped him into the perfect interviewee that Steve, with his awkward shyness, could never hope to be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2026 So sure, we disagree now and again, but it never puts a mission in jeopardy. Cap will always defer to me on aerial combat, and I\u2019ll defer to him ground combat in the end,\u201d Tony finished his answer, smiling over at Steve. Steve resisted the urge to lean over for a kiss right then.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe next question is directed at you Mr. Stark, and it was actually written by Captain America himself!\u201d The applause erupted when Steve stood. Tony met his eyes, confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 he mouthed the words. Steve only gave him a nervous smile in response.\u00a0</p><p>As the applause died down, Steve realized he couldn\u2019t back out of this now. He got down on one knee, ignoring the way the audience began screaming in excitement. Steve was focused only on Tony\u2019s reactions. The brunette\u2019s confused look slowly morphed into a scarily blank face, but Steve could see the fear in the man\u2019s eyes mixed with anxious excitement. There was so much there in the brown eyes, and maybe this had been a horrible mistake. Steve held his breath as he pulled the little box out and opened it.\t</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart had stopped. He was certain of it. What was Steve thinking!? He felt dizzy, and oh yeah, maybe he needed to breathe. He took in a shaky breath. He couldn\u2019t even tell anymore if he was ecstatic or terrified. Of course he had wanted this, more than anyone could imagine, but Steve was not thinking this through. The right wing news was going to tear them to shreds tomorrow. A hush fell over the audience, and Tony could feel the people leaning forward on their seats in anticipation, but his own gaze was locked onto the kneeling blond.\u00a0\t</p><p>\u201cAnthony Edward Stark, will you marry me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony forgot his own very valid fears when the words hit him. Steve wanted to marry him! How many times had he dreamed about this very moment? The fact that they were on live television faded away and Tony needed to keep breathing. Steve\u2019s face was so hopeful and nervous, and that made Tony want to burst out laughing. Did the man honestly think Tony could ever say no to him? He cleared his throat. \u201cYes,\u201d it came out as a whisper. \u201cYes,\u201d he said louder this time. \u201cOf course, you idiot, now get up here.\u201d\t</p><p>Tony pulled the stupidly grinning Steve off his knees and into a kiss. The audience went wild and their host was saying something about happy couples and a commercial break, but all the two men cared about was each other. Tony swore he could feel Steve\u2019s heartbeat thrumming through him. Steve smiled against his lips, trying to pull back, but Tony clutched the man\u2019s jacket tight. Steve would not escape him that easily.\t</p><p>Kimmel clearing his throat startled them both back to reality. Steve blushed a deep scarlet that matched his tie, and Tony smirked at how swollen his lips looked. \u201cWhile I understand the sentiment, gentleman, we\u2019ll be back live in a two minutes. So maybe the ring shouldn\u2019t be on the floor?\u201d He pointed to the forgotten black box Steve had dropped.\u00a0</p><p>Steve snatched the box back up, slipping the ring onto Tony\u2019s finger. When they were back in their seats, much closer together on the couch now, Tony actually looked at the ring for the first time. It was a simple silver ring with a blue stone the colour of Steve\u2019s eyes. On close inspection, the band itself had an intricate design carved into it that made reminded Tony of a circuit board. It was too perfect, and Tony was grinning at it like a smitten schoolgirl when the band and applause indicated the end of the adbreak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, Mr. Stark, show the cameras your beautiful ring!\u201d Tony held up his hand as the camera zoomed in, wiggling his fingers excitedly. \u201cIt really is something, isn\u2019t it? Captain Rogers, where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>Steve squeezed Tony\u2019s other hand in his lap. \u201cI, uh, well, I got the stone from an antique store, but I made it.\u201d Tony gaped at his fianc\u00e9. When had the man found time?\t</p><p>\u201cOh, wow!\u201d Kimmel leaned back in his chair in clear surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I knew you could make jewelry. Is this something you\u2019ve done a lot?\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled. His elation had rid him of all his usual shyness. Tony had said yes! \u201cIt\u2019s my first attempt at jewelry, I\u2019ll admit. I\u2019m not very into metalworking, Tony being the metal expert I leave it to him, but I did go to art school before I enlisted. I know a thing or two about design and aesthetic.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! I forgot about the art school. I\u2019m a bit rusty on my 1940s Steve Rogers trivia, I\u2019ll admit. I did go to your exhibit at the museum once, though.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the interview went by in a blur for the two of them. Tony wanted nothing more than to get Steve out of those clothes so he could show him how much he really appreciated the proposal. While he wasn\u2019t necessarily against jumping the man on TV, public indecency was frowned upon and whatnot. When they got home, Tony couldn\u2019t even strip immediately like he wanted, because the Avengers were waiting with a banner and surprise party. Tony and Steve grinned their way through the congratulations, making sure they spent a proper amount of time enjoying the party, but they both just wanted to be alone.</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d Tony growled after he slammed their door shut. Steve had no complaints with the fervor, only helped Tony to strip them both down as quickly as possible. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that on television,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was husky with arousal. Steve allowed him to hold him down on the bed, just watching the smaller man kiss a line down his front before gasping in surprise when Tony nipped the inside of his thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>Steve huffed. He was too distracted by the sensation of Tony\u2019s hands on him to think clearly. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be complaining,\u201d he replied dizzily. Tony teased at his tip with his tongue, and Steve hissed. His hips bucked before he could stop them, but Tony smirked up at him, victorious. He had Steve at his mercy in five minutes tops every time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m not complaining,\u201d he murmured, crawling back up to silence Steve\u2019s moan with his own mouth as he wrapped a hand around Steve\u2019s penis. He gave a lazy stroke, impressed with how quickly Steve could be so hard. He began sucking at Steve\u2019s neck, pulling his hand away to scratch ten red lines up Steve\u2019s abs and chest. The air hitting the raw skin was a perfect contrast to the moist warmth of Tony\u2019s mouth on Steve\u2019s neck. Tony pulled back to look down at Steve from above. His pupils were blown wide and Steve thought he had never looked more beautiful. \u201cYou are insane, though,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was strained, his own erection untouched so far. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to leave the tower for weeks without being harassed by reporters.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve ignored Tony\u2019s hand this time when he tried to block Steve from grabbing him. He felt Tony twitch eagerly in his grasp as he watched Tony throw his head back with a moan. Tony\u2019s sounds were always the best part for Steve. The man could make the most obscene noises, and it was the only time Steve could make him fumble his words. Steve reached into the drawer beside him, pulling out the lube. \u201cI really don\u2019t care,\u201d Steve responded before sticking a slicked finger inside his new fianc\u00e9. He grinned when Tony whined and pushed down onto the finger, already begging for more.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>Tony had been predictably correct. The next morning, every news station across TV and radio was talking about Captain America\u2019s engagement to Iron Man. Steve decided his morning run was not worth it when he saw the crowd waiting right outside the tower. He decided to ignore Tony\u2019s \u2018I told you so\u2019 smug face when he returned from the lobby and headed to the gym to use the treadmill. Tony was still in the kitchen watching another news channel an hour later.</p><p>Steve walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around Tony, who leaned back for a kiss. \u201cHow was your run?\u201d he smirked up at Steve.</p><p>Steve merely returned the smirk. \u201cStill worth it,\u201d he kissed Tony again, savoring the coffee taste. Tony returned to the news on the tablet in front of him, holding out his empty mug towards Steve. Steve shook his head fondly as he refilled the coffee before moving to make his second breakfast. \u201cHave you eaten anything today?\u201d he called behind his shoulder.</p><p>Tony only hummed in response, too focused on whatever the reporter was saying in front of him to actually listen to what Steve had asked. Steve couldn\u2019t hear anything, so the captions must be on. He gave up and decided to make Tony some food anyway, since he likely hadn\u2019t had anything besides coffee. If he didn\u2019t eat it, Clint certainly always would, so it\u2019d hardly go to waste. Tony let out a frustrated growl behind him. \u201cTony,\u201d he sighed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ignore them? That\u2019s what you normally do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d He finished his coffee and set it on the counter a little too hard. \u201cI\u2019m used to the things they say about me, but now they\u2019re saying horrible things about you! Well, mostly me still and how I must have duped you or am a bad influence but still! Fox is saying you\u2019ve betrayed you values,\u201d he looked to see why Steve had stopped making cooking noises. The blond looked much angrier than Tony was expecting. He had seem so unperturbed by it all only a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cThey said that you duped me?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was low and dangerous. \u201cThat you influence me negatively!?\u201d It rose to a near shout. Tony flinched instinctively, not used to Steve\u2019s actually angry voice in the close quarters of the small kitchen. Steve lowered his voice again, annoyed that he had made Tony flinch. \u201cJARVIS, call Anne and have her come over today if she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight on it, Captain Rogers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony gaped at the man, lost. \u201cWhy are you talking to PR? I thought the plan was to ignore them until they moved onto the next big story?\u201d He watched Steve war with himself, his face twitching with conflicting emotions. He moved forward, turned off the stovetop before Steve burned his food, and grabbed Steve\u2019s hands from underneath his crossed arms. Steve watched their hands for a moment, before meeting Tony\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat is bothering you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he reopened them he looked much calmer. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. JARVIS, can you cancel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the idea that I\u2019m somehow better than you I guess. Like why not ask if I was the one who duped you?\u201d Steve looked so sad and confused, Tony felt so heartless for the laugh that slipped past his lips unwanted. Steve pulled his hands away, irritated.</p><p>\u201cWait, no, sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to laugh,\u201d Tony started. Steve had turned back to cooking, though, and wasn\u2019t looking at Tony. \u201cSteve, please.\u201d</p><p>Steve kept cooking. \u201cGo on Tony,\u201d he said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, the idea of you duping me was really funny to me, I didn\u2019t mean to actually laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the idea of me duping you is fine?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Tony felt like he had walked into some sort of trap. That there was a wrong answer here. Maybe he should work around the question rather than answering directly. \u201cWell if one of us were better than the other, you\u2019re clearly the better one.\u201d That was the wrong answer. All of Steve\u2019s movements became sharp and harsh, slamming plates down and dumping food on them messily before throwing utensils in the sink. The clamour seemed to solidify that Tony had fucked up.\u00a0</p><p>Steve sat down at the counter, so Tony took his own seat warily. They ate in tense silence for several long minutes before Steve looked up at him again. He looked sad instead of angry. \u201cYou believe that don\u2019t you?\u201d Tony ran through the conversation again, not sure what was being asked. \u201cThat I\u2019m better than you. That you duped me.\u201d The questions had become statements.\u00a0</p><p>Tony felt like an idiot for not realizing what was bothering the man earlier. Of course it was because he thought they were equals. Tony and the rest of the world knew that Steve was a better person, but Steve had come to believe that Tony was as good as himself. Tony wasn\u2019t complaining, but he knew it wasn\u2019t true. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he spoke sincerely. He couldn\u2019t lie and tell Steve that he was wrong, but he could apologize for it.</p><p>Steve took Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you are.\u201d He kissed Tony on the forehead. \u201cI love you so much, and I will make you believe that you deserve me someday.\u201d Tony threw him a lopsided smile. He would love that to happen.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>By the time the Stark Industries Halloween Gala rolled around a few months later, the stories about Steve and Tony had died down. Here and there a piece would show up offering someone\u2019s opinion on the matter, but everyone had moved onto more important things for the most part. Like what the two engaged superheroes would be wearing to the Gala.</p><p>\u201cI really think you could pull off a dress, shellhead,\u201d Clint said at dinner that night. Thor had brought a tabloid magazine to the table with an article speculating about their attire. \u201cThen maybe the conservatives will be a little happier about Steve\u2019s gayness if you\u2019re the feminine one.\u201d\u00a0The rest of the Avengers had found the whole debacle immensely amusing. Clint especially loved to poke fun at the stories where Tony was an evil seducer that turned Captain America gay.\u00a0</p><p>Tony pretended to think about it. \u201cI suppose I could really piss them all off by shaving and wearing a wig. Though that may offend the drag or trans communities. I\u2019ve always wanted to get into drag, though. Imagine me, a drag queen. Iron maiden, I could be a dominatrix-esque drag queen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I would love to help you come up with routines!\u201d Thor enthused. It may or may not actually be one of Tony\u2019s secret dreams, but he knew he\u2019d never be able to get into it without a media shit-storm claiming he was trying to poke fun or was a bigot. Really, he wasn\u2019t sure where the idea had come about that Tony would be conservative or right-wing was beyond him. His dad may have been a capitalist douche bag, but even Howard had thought being anti-LGBTQ+ was just plain stupid. Like who cares what people do in their private lives? If it\u2019s not hurting anyone\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never realized how much I wanted to see you in drag,\u201d Natasha commented, eyeing him intensely. \u201cAnd I see Steve is on the same page,\u201d she glanced over at the blushing man, only causing his blush to deepen.\u00a0</p><p>Tony spit out his drink. \u201cWait, Steve, is it true?\u201d He turned to look at his fianc\u00e9 excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, well, I, uhm,\u201d he spluttered. \u201cI would want you to keep the goatee!\u201d he blurted out. Tony could not have found a more adorable man to marry. He pulled Steve in for a kiss, that quickly turned a bit too sexually charged for the dinner table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, God, get a room!\u201d Clint flung some peas at Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Tony ignored the projectiles, but pulled away nonetheless. \u201cI can dress in drag for you,\u201d he whispered in Steve\u2019s ear before going back to his dinner as though nothing had happened. Steve might just pass out from how red he was getting. Tony tried to keep his expression innocent, only grinning in victory inside his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have come up with a few outfit pairs for you, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Coulson spoke, dry as always, so Tony couldn\u2019t tell if he was serious. The way Clint whipped around in surprise told him that Coulson wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cI worked on it with Darcy,\u201d he said with a shrug as though that explained anything at all.\u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t deny that he was curious. \u201cI\u2019d love to see them,\u201d he told Coulson, happy to change the subject from Tony in drag. Not even he had known he wanted that until the picture had popped into his head. \u201cThe Gala is masquerade though, right?\u201d Steve turned to look at Tony.</p><p>Tony nodded. \u201cYeah, although most people only have their masks on in the beginning for pictures.\u201d He scrunched up his nose. \u201cThey get weirdly sweaty.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m adding you to our google doc, Cap,\u201d Phil said while he typed on his phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo I have to go?\u201d Bruce asked from the other end of the table? \u201cI know we were all invited, but I hate these things.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned at his best friend. \u201cWell I can hardly force you, but it\u2019d look better if the Avengers all showed up so the press doesn\u2019t come up with some stupid theory like that we\u2019re not getting along or something. Knowing them they might decide you hate that Steve and I are together. I\u2019ve seen some hilarious fan theories that you\u2019re jealous because you and me were meant to be,\u201d Tony snorted.</p><p>Bruce\u2019s cheeks turned pink. \u201cYou and me? You\u2019re not really my type.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, right!?\u201d Tony was still laughing hysterically. \u201cSo you\u2019ll come?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Bruce nodded in defeat, \u201cIf it\u2019ll keep them from theorizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>They ended up on tuxes with each other\u2019s usual colour schemes. Tony wore a light blue vest, with matching pinstripes on his pants. The tux jacket and bowtie were black with a blue shimmer that you could see only when the light hit it right. He thought it looked perfect with his engagement ring, and he used one of those blue tinted mascaras to accentuate his naturally long lashes. Now that he knew Steve had a thing for it, he finally had an excuse to start exploring some of the more feminine parts of vanity he\u2019d always wanted to, but he\u2019d start slow. There was the public to consider, of course.</p><p>Steve wore a maroon vest with a black tux, and his bow tie matched the vest. The best part, in Tony\u2019s opinion, was the gold glittery shimmer that was over the whole tux set. Tony wasn\u2019t sure how his designer friend, Janet Van Dyne, had done it, but it looked like someone had very lightly sprayed the whole thing with gold glitter spray paint. Steve\u2019s mask was an arc-reactor blue, as he called it, feathered along one side with gold feathers. Tony\u2019s was a phantom of the opera half face style white, with a red and blue gradient of tiny, sparkly stars along the outer edge. Together they looked simultaneously gorgeous and ridiculous.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did I get such a handsome fianc\u00e9?\u201d Steve asked in wonder as they headed out for the limo, already assaulted by paparazzi. The security detail for the Avengers was being handled by SHIELD and SI together given the amount of super-powered enemies they had all acquired over the years. Tony had the bracelets to call the suit if needed, Steve had the shield waiting at the gala in a closet, Clint had his foldable bow with arrows stored next to Steve\u2019s shield, Thor was always able to call Mjolnir, and Phil and Natasha were strapped with handguns and knives.</p><p>Tony grinned, waving at a couple of photographers happily. \u201cBy being a sweet, sensitive artist who throws a disc at nazis and aliens,\u201d he answered without missing a beat. Steve\u2019s resulting laugh sounded musical to his ears. He felt like he was walking on air tonight. This was their first formal public event since the engagement, and though they\u2019d of course gone on dates and missions together since, he felt like this was his first real opportunity to show off his fianc\u00e9. There was a slightly bitter thought in the back of his mind that he\u2019d like to see Howard\u2019s stupid face when he found out his beloved perfect Steve was marrying his failure son Tony, but he easily pushed it away. Steve was going to marry him, had announced it publicly, his life was perfect.\u00a0</p><p>When they arrived and stepped out of the limo, there were not only photographers, but reporters too. They stopped off to one side to answer a few questions before they got in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCaptain America, what do you say to the family values activists who say you\u2019ve gone over to the dark side and should be stripped of your title?\u201d A woman from the back shouted.</p><p>Steve took it in stride. Tony had been practicing with him for months, so he\u2019d be prepared for far worse questions than this. \u201cI say that I am sorry they are so frightened by what they don\u2019t understand. Just because a man loving another man is different than their own love lives does not make their idea of a family more valid than LGBTQ+ families, and their self-appointed cause of family values is a misguided bigotry.\u201d</p><p>Tony was so proud. \u201cDo you honestly think they\u2019re afraid of gays or is it maybe that they just hate them?\u201d A man nearby asked. Tony leaned over to whisper in Steve\u2019s ear that it was Ian Gerund, a reporter for <i>Out Magazine</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked the man in the eyes the whole time he responded, which obviously made the man a little uncomfortable. Reporters were not used to such directness with their shouted questions, as Tony had warned him. \u201cI do honestly think that. I also think there is some genuine hate out there. Hate often stems from fear, though, and as Marian Anderson, one of my favourite singers said, \u2018Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.\u2019 Our only hope is to continue to meet hate and fear with love and acceptance, but defend ourselves when attacked.\u201dThe reporters nearby had clearly not been prepared for such well thought out responses, and there was a small wave of confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark! Are you really ready to be sexually exclusive with one person \u2018til death do you part?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t help the painful tightening of his hand around Tony\u2019s. The questions directed at them were so different and obviously judgmental about the two of them and it pissed him off. Everyone was prepared for Steve to be an innocent backwards old man and for Tony to be a promiscuous conniving bastard. Tony, on the other hand, was used to it. He shot the offending reporter a wicked grin. \u201cOh, Steve is plenty sexually fulfilling to me, sweet-cheeks. Sorry you missed out on your opportunity,\u201d he finished with a wink. Steve thought that was a perfect time to leave.</p><p>\u201cSorry folks, we have people to see and dances to dance,\u201d Steve said, strained. He tugged on Tony\u2019s hand, but the man had no qualms about following anyway. He hated talking to reporters as much as Steve did. He just hid it better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did so well, babe.\u201d He pulled Steve\u2019s hands to his lips, kissing the knuckles. \u201cProud of you.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled at him, but his eyes were a little pinched. \u201cYeah, thanks for the practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, love. They\u2019ll eventually stop treating you like that. It\u2019s just hard for some people to recognize that not everyone in the 40s was straight and hated gays,\u201d Tony spoke quietly, misunderstanding the reason for the distress.</p><p>Steve kissed him, which conveniently gave him the excuse to be right at Tony\u2019s eye level as he said, \u201cI could care less how they treat me. It\u2019s how they treat you like an amoral, selfish party-boy who is going to cheat on me first chance he gets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I was for a long time,\u201d Tony reminded him. Steve didn\u2019t have a chance to respond before the greetings and small talk of the night began.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark! Captain Rogers! So good to see you.\u201d Steve didn\u2019t recognize the man, though Tony seemed to. Sometimes it seemed to Steve that Tony knew everyone in New York, though. \u201cIt really is a lovely event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Germaine, thank you for coming. I don\u2019t believe you two have actually met, this is Captain Steve Rogers, my fianc\u00e9,\u201d he used the title feeling giddy. \u201cSteve, this is Lt. Frances Germaine. We met while I was working on the Stylus project, right?\u201d</p><p>Lt. Germaine nodded. \u201cYou were showing us your new remote controls for a drone that allowed more precise aim and birdseye view so there\u2019d be less accidental civilian casualties,\u201d he reminded Tony.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh yes, hope that worked out,\u201d Tony remarked. \u201cIt was a little before Afghanistan when I was still designing while wasted so,\u201d he shrugged with his most self-deprecating smile.\u00a0</p><p>Steve frowned at Tony, but Germaine gave a knowing chuckle. \u201cIt saved numerous lives from unnecessary accidents, I assure you,\u201d he placed a comforting hand on the genius\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYou really weren\u2019t the devil people made you out to be, y\u2019know. The wake up call about SI accountability and double-dealing was important, but you should cut yourself some slack. Even as a kid you were doing good work.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave a strained smile. \u201cThanks, Lieutenant. I hope you enjoy the party.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The man caught on to the dismissal. \u201cNice to meet you, Captain.\u201d They shook hands and he departed. Tony snagged a three drinks off a roaming tray and handed one to Steve. He drained one, placing it back on the tray, and kept the other.</p><p>Before Steve could comment on the conversation that had just happened, he heard the familiar gleeful squeal of Janet. \u201cOh, boys, you look fabulous! Give me a little spin,\u201d she motioned. They obeyed, laughing. \u201cYes! Perfect! The coattails had me worried there for you Cap, your proportions are wonky. Didn\u2019t want them to look too short. Oh! Tony, darling, I haven\u2019t seen the ring in person, gimme,\u201d she held out her hand expectantly.</p><p>Tony was laughing and enjoying himself again, previous conversation with the Lieutenant long forgotten. He handed the ring over and the two started gushing about Steve\u2019s taste. Steve was still thinking about the previous conversation, so he was a little startled when the two of them were looking at him expectantly. \u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><p>Janet burst out laughing. \u201cI asked you how long it took you to make the ring?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve blushed, embarrassed. \u201cOh, only like a week after I found the right stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how long before that have you been planning to ask me?\u201d Tony asked, hand on his hip. He only got even sassier around Janet. The two together could be a nightmare sometimes. When Tony, Janet, and Clint were all three in a room, one\u2019s only hope was to flee before you got caught in their whirlwind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTwo years?\u201d Steve answered hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThat was before we had even started dating!!!\u201d Tony exclaimed.\u00a0</p><p>Steve scratched at the back of his head, not having a good response for this. He had kind of been hoping it would never cross Tony\u2019s mind to ask. \u201cYeah, I may have been in love with you and overly optimistic for a long time before we confessed to each other,\u201d he attempted to explain.</p><p>\u201cThat is the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Janet remarked. Tony just looked at him with wide eyes, feeling like he was falling in love with Steve all over again. This man was far better than he could have ever dreamed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Janet, your outfits are lovely and we need to get together soon and catch up,\u201d Tony started without looking away from Steve, \u201cbut I need to take this man to the dancefloor, <i>now</i>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I understand,\u201d Janet responded too seriously. \u201cGet on with it!\u201d She faux whispered to Steve while he was led away by Tony.</p><p>They danced to a song Steve didn\u2019t recognize, but it hardly mattered. He only had eyes for Tony and followed the man\u2019s lead. Tony had been taught to dance when he was three and it more than made up for Steve\u2019s two left feet. Tony finished his drink so he could use two hands again, placing it on the passing waiter\u2019s tray. He frowned at Steve\u2019s untouched drink before snatching it, draining it, and also placing it on said waiter\u2019s tray. The waiter scowled before he walked away. Had that been the same one as before?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had three drinks already and this is only our first dance,\u201d Steve remarked lightly. He wasn\u2019t worried. Tony hadn\u2019t gotten too drunk since they\u2019d gotten engaged. The genius seemed to only get past buzzed when he was upset or depressed.\u00a0</p><p>Tony waved him off. \u201cThree drinks is nothing for me, you know that,\u201d he smiled brightly. He wasn\u2019t wrong. Tony often didn\u2019t feel anything until the fifth drink depending on the strength, and these were just glasses of champagne. He typically drank straight liquor. \u201cI wish they\u2019d play something slower,\u201d he said casually, pulling Steve into him.</p><p>It was like it was planned, and maybe it was, Steve thought. This was a SI organized party afterall. The music shifted to a slow song, and it took Steve a until the vocals to realize it was. \u201cIs this-?\u201d he felt at a loss for words. He had never mentioned his love for Marian Anderson before.\u00a0</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips quirked sideways, a cross between a smile and a nervous squint. \u201c<i>Solitude</i>, or <i>The Jewish Girl\u2019s Song </i>as performed by Marian Anderson? Yes.\u201d</p><p>Steve felt his eyes well up with tears. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d He asked softly. Tony was up against him, head resting against Steve\u2019s chest as they slowly danced to the movement of Marian\u2019s voice. The orchestral part didn\u2019t move much, so it made more sense to set one\u2019s movements to the woman\u2019s emotional performance. Tony waited until the song finished to answer Steve\u2019s question. Steve vaguely realized that the rest of the large ballroom was full of people confused by the sudden change in language and style, but it didn\u2019t matter. They\u2019d get over it when the regular modern music returned.</p><p>\u201cWell, I may have been playing different artists in the background when you\u2019re around and gauging your reactions with JARVIS\u2019 help. We eventually narrowed down your best unconscious smiles to music that style-wise and time period led to Marian Anderson, so I figured she must be one of your faves, and then you quoted her outside and I\u2019m so glad I wasn\u2019t wrong, because sometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out what you liked from your old life and-\u201d the man was rambling nervously, and they both knew it.\u00a0</p><p>Steve placed a finger to his lips, silencing the man. \u201cEverytime I think you\u2019re done surprising me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou blow away my expectations again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony absolutely beamed at him. It had been a very long and difficult project, trying to figure out some of Steve\u2019s interests. The man was so easygoing and not picky sometimes that it was impossible to tell what he actually liked and what he just didn\u2019t mind. Tony wished Steve was a little more outspoken, but he also appreciated the little mysteries he had to work to solve about Steve. It kept the man interesting. His next project was trying to figure out the supersoldier\u2019s favourite painters and art styles for a wedding portrait, but that was still a secret. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you like it. I bought the film for the original recording of her performance at the Lincoln Memorial,\u201d Tony was actually blushing a little. He very rarely blushed. His olive italian complexion made it harder to show than Steve\u2019s pale irish white, but he also didn\u2019t have much shame anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Steve gasped in surprise, pulling Tony into him and holding on tight for a moment. The mention thrust him back to 1939 when the historic performance had been the talk of the nation. Marian had been such a big deal, paving the way for African American singers, and she got to sing at the Lincoln Memorial. Steve\u2019s mother had followed the woman\u2019s career closely, always reminding Steve that until the blacks were treated right, the immigrants had no hope. She had died only months before the Lincoln Memorial performance. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The rest of the night seemed to be going by in the background. Steve just followed his partner\u2019s lead, making small talk here and there, dancing, clapping, showing off their relationship, etc. Something at the back of his mind was bothering him, but he couldn\u2019t quite place it, so he pushed it aside and focused on Tony. The billionaire was in his element, as much as he was loathe to admit it. Tony Stark was a socialite as well as a shut-in engineer. Tony liked to convince himself that the rich celebrity persona was all a facade, and a lot of it was, but Steve could tell that the man also felt at home at these events sometimes. Now if the world worked Tony\u2019s way, there\u2019d only be one or two events a year, but if all of them suddenly disappeared, Steve thought Tony would probably miss it more than he expected.</p><p>It was when Tony placed his sixth empty champagne glass on a tray behind him that Steve realized what was bothering him. Out of the thirty or so roaming servers in the room, the same one always seemed to gravitate towards them. Tony had only come in contact with the one waiter, though he probably didn\u2019t notice at all. At first, it could\u2019ve been explained away by the staff having assigned areas of the room. By now, though, Steve and Tony had been all over the large hall, Tony being one of the main draws of the event. They had to talk to all the big SI contributors.</p><p>Tony\u2019s energy had been flagging over the last hour. He had gone from looking excited and flamboyant to looking tired and withdrawn. Steve caught him wiping a sweaty brow a few times, but until now, had only assumed it was due to the running around in a tux in a fairly hot room. No one else seemed to be sweating though. \u201cHey, wait up!\u201d Steve called out, jogging after the man until he caught up with the waiter. Tony watched him go in confusion, but stayed where he was, not wanting to seem rude while he was still trapped in conversation with one of the major shareholders in his company.\u00a0</p><p>The waiter turned to face Steve, mild surprise on his face. He looked so nondescript. An average height white male, light brown hair, probably middle aged. It was a wonder Steve had recognized him as familiar at all. That was one of Phil\u2019s assets as a SHIELD agent, looking nondescript. Steve idly wondered if being around nondescript agents enough to get to know them helped him be better at picking up on nuances within the average appearance. The man smiled politely. \u201cMay I help you with something, Captain Rogers?\u201d</p><p>Steve watched his expressions carefully. If there was anything suspicious about the man, he was good at hiding it. \u201cHave you been following us?\u201d he asked right out.</p><p>The waiter\u2019s face showed a split-second of surprise before returning to the polite smile.\u00a0Steve probably wouldn\u2019t have caught it if it weren\u2019t for Natasha\u2019s training in microexpressions. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d he pretended to be confused. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t know what set off his alarm bells, but he was sure enough of himself to be okay with making a scene. He snatched the tray from the man\u2019s hands and placed it on a nearby table. People close by started watching the strange exchange. Steve then grabbed the man\u2019s arm and twisted it painfully behind his back. \u201cDon\u2019t play stupid.\u201d He hissed into the man\u2019s ear.</p><p>A hysterical giggle tumbled from the waiter\u2019s lips. \u201cYour observational skills are as impressive as I expected,\u201d the man responded smugly. \u201cI only worry it took you too long.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound worried at all. Steve decided then and there that he hated the smug bastard.\u00a0</p><p>Slamming the man onto the same nearby table where he hat set the tray, Steve sent several glasses flying off the table or rolling and smashing loudly on the ground. A woman somewhere screamed. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cSteve! What are you doing!?\u201d Tony was marching towards them with two guards.</p><p>Steve took a steadying breath through his nose. \u201cThis man did something, Tony, I just don\u2019t know what,\u201d Steve grit out angrily. The man smirked at Steve. He was asking to get his nose broken.</p><p>Tony just looked more confused and irritated. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Let the man go, Steve.\u201d Tony placed a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but if this guy did do something, let security handle it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked back and forth between the smug bastard and his love, ignoring the awkward silence that had descended on the party while the drama unfolded. Tony was right, he didn\u2019t know what had gotten into him. He stood, pushing the waiter towards one of the guards, who caught the stumbling man easily and pinned his arms behind his back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what came over me,\u201d he murmured, head down. He had almost certainly ruined the party, and had definitely embarrassed Tony in front of the business world.\u00a0</p><p>When Tony didn\u2019t respond, he raised his head so he could see the man\u2019s expression. He was beginning to look very pale, and a bead of sweat ran down the un-masked side of his face. It seemed like a weird time for Steve to notice that they had never removed their masks like Tony said he normally did, but Steve\u2019s mind was all over the place. He stepped towards the man, \u201cTony?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time it kicked in,\u201d the smug asshole called out, and Tony turned slowly towards him, looking shocked and confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWha?\u201d Tony stepped towards him but stumbled, and Steve had to lunge to catch him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>Everyone was watching the scene unfold. Tony was in his arms looking dazed, breathing too quickly. Steve looked back at the asshole, and when they met eyes the man spoke again. \u201cHe was the problem, see? Now you can be Captain America again, unsoiled!\u201d There was a mad glint to the man\u2019s eyes. The guard holding him began dragging him away so they could question him in private. Pepper was approaching from the other direction with medics on either side of her.</p><p>Steve looked down again, terror beginning to take its icy hold on his heart. \u201cTony? Sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up at him, scared himself.\u00a0\u201cSteve? I-\u201d he shuddered in Steve\u2019s arms. \u201cI don\u2019t feel well.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d he tried to sound convincing as he laid the man on the ground for the medics to take over and examine. He stayed as close as he could so Tony could still see him. It was clear that panic was starting to take over for Tony though, and he reached out for Steve. His chest was heaving visibly.\u00a0</p><p>Steve grabbed one of the glasses he knew Tony had drank from, more thankful than he\u2019d ever been for his eidetic memory. \u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019ll be on this,\u201d he showed the medic who wasn\u2019t currently taking Tony\u2019s pulse.</p><p>\u201cGood, bring it with you,\u201d the medic commanded. \u201cWe gotta go, now.\u201d</p><p>Another two had arrived with a stretcher and they were lifting Tony onto it. Steve followed beside them, holding Tony\u2019s outstretched hand. Tony looked like he was about to say something, but instead cried out in pain and clutched at his abdomen. His breathing remained labored all the way to the helicopter, where it stopped altogether. Steve was gently pushed into a seat while they started manually inflating Tony\u2019s lungs, and Steve\u2019s world was spinning. Tony \u00a0was writhing in pain, still semi-conscious and all Steve could do was watch helplessly. When they landed at the hospital, Steve tried to stand and follow, but his knees locked in place and he was so dizzy.\u00a0</p><p>A nurse was there at his side, and when had he laid down on the ground. \u201cHey, you\u2019re okay, it\u2019s just emotional shock. Let\u2019s get you a blanket and some water, okay?\u201d The man in scrubs said. Steve nodded, allowing the man to help him into shaky legs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d he asked, hoping the guy new what he meant.\u00a0</p><p>Thankfully, he did. \u201cYou fianc\u00e9 is being taken care of right now. Thankfully, we were able to determine the poison pretty quickly with his symptoms and the residue on the glass. We\u2019re starting him on chelation. As long as he holds out a little longer, he\u2019ll make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p><i>As long as he holds out</i> is what stuck in Steve\u2019s mind. So there was still a chance Tony could die. \u201cI need to be there,\u201d he ground out, lurching forward from the chair he had been sat in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the nurse caught his arm. \u201cOkay, okay, let me take you there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve let him lead the way, and they were to Tony\u2019s bed where an IV was still being put in his arm, and the man was already intubated. Steve collapsed unceremoniously into the seat beside Tony opposite to the side the nurse was on, grabbing Tony\u2019s hand. He squeezed just tight enough to let Tony know he was there, that Tony had to pull through. The words he had spoken earlier that night were running through his head on repeat and he felt sick. <i>Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.</i>\u00a0</p><p>How could someone do something like this to someone like Tony? All in the name of \u00a0him being Captain America, \u2018unsoiled\u2019? The idea of Steve being with another man was so frightful to someone that they\u2019d poison Iron Man just to stop it? It was completely illogical and \u00a0crazy, but that was the point. Steve was terrified in this very moment, and it was coupled with a rage and illogical desire to beat the waiter to death. Such violence wouldn\u2019t help Tony survive, and it would do zero good for the world, but the idea of it alone helped assuage some of Steve\u2019s fear. Fear could truly turn the gentlest of men to inhumane acts. It shouldn\u2019t have been such a surprise to Steve, he had already seen it played out in the war, but the shock of it was real everytime he faced that reality. Tony would be okay, he had to be, but Steve would be haunted by this forever.</p>",

People do dangerous things when they fear what they don\u2019t understand, and apparently two men in love is just too spooky for them.\n\n<br></p>[[MORE]]<p><b><br></b>\t\u201cFear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.\u201d - Marian\u00a0Anderson</p><p>Steve Rogers often forgot that he wasn\u2019t just a man. Captain America was a symbol of hope and patriotism, and the man behind the mask was often put on a pedestal. The average american who didn\u2019t personally know him typically had their own distinct ideas about who Steve should be. Tony tried to make the man understand that, but he never wanted to listen.\t</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! They can think what they want but I know who I am, Tony, and I don\u2019t care if people like it,\u201d Steve shouted. The argument wasn\u2019t a new one, and his patience was beginning to wear thin. He understands that Tony\u2019s heart is in the right place, but the genius was not hearing his words.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Tony threw his hands up in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re Captain fucking America!\u201d He ignored Steve\u2019s muttered \u2018language.\u2019 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you care about the public opinion, the public will make themselves heard anyway. When people decide they hate something you do, they don\u2019t just say it, they riot. When they like what you do, they throw parades to celebrate.\u201d He sighed, the anger draining out of him, leaving only weariness. \u201cI wish I was wrong, you could cause a civil war just be saying the wrong thing, Steve. We can\u2019t be public.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>That was the crux of it all, wasn\u2019t it? Steve wanted the world to know how important Tony was to him, but Tony kept blocking his attempts to talk about their relationship to the press. Everytime a question about his love life came up, he would open his mouth to answer only for Tony to divert their attention with one of his latest scandals. Reporters would shout loudly over each other for a chance to get the great Tony Stark\u2019s comment on something controversial, and Steve\u2019s responses would be dead on his lips. Tonight was going to be the end of it. Steve had made sure of his plan. It didn\u2019t matter this time how much Tony tried to talk him out of it. The world would know about his feelings and his sexual orientation.\t</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 2018. Nobody is going to riot because Captain America is gay.\u201d Steve was done with this conversation. Tony\u2019s attitude was spoiling his good mood. \u201cI\u2019m going to go for a run. Be ready to leave at seven.\u201d He left the lab before Tony could say more. Pepper and the Avengers\u2019 PR agent had set up the interview on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> several months back. According to them, Kimmel wanted to talk to the two of them about being the Avengers\u2019 leaders, and how their different leadership styles meshed during missions. When Steve had called Kimmel\u2019s assistant with his idea last week, Jimmy himself had called him back to tell him it was a go.\t</p><p>\u201cThe audience will love it!\u201d Kimmel exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll throw it into the middle of the interview, so there\u2019s time for Mr. Stark\u2019s reaction to play out whatever it is. When I tell him that you wrote the next question, that\u2019ll be your cue. Oh, I\u2019m so excited! My show is going to be talked about for weeks!\u201d\t</p><p>Steve grinned into his phone. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful you\u2019re allowing it Mr. Kimmel, I\u2019m sorry to take away time from what you had planned.\u201d\t</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! This is way better than anything my writers could come up with!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Steve checked his hair in the mirror for the fifth time. He felt like a walking flag in his navy blue suit, with red tie and white shirt, but Pepper had brow beat him into wearing it. Tony was going to be wearing a gold tie with a deep red suit and shirt. Tony loved it, but Steve wished they didn\u2019t have to be so obviously mimicking their uniforms. It made him feel like they weren\u2019t allowed to be Steve and Tony, they were only allowed to be Captain America and Iron Man. He was reminded of his fear of being a dancing monkey that had began all the war back in WWII.\u00a0</p><p>The small black box in his pocket brought Steve back to the present. He patted the lump, taking a deep breath. He was<i> not </i>nervous. Tony was going to say yes. All Steve needed to do was ask. The question was really a formality; Steve and Tony had been promising each other eternity for awhile now. Tony wasn\u2019t ashamed of being with Steve. They were only a secret because Tony thought the public couldn\u2019t handle Steve being with a man. That was all. \u00a0The knock on the door forced him to give up on the internal pep talk.\t</p><p>\u201cSteve! Happy is waiting!\u201d\t</p><p>Steve opened the door where Tony was still knocking. He smiled down at his handsome boyfriend, stealing a kiss. The aroma of his aftershave burned Steve\u2019s nostrils a little. He loved it all the same. No matter how hard Tony tried, he\u2019d always have the slight smell of metal and oil clinging to him that Steve loved. \u201cLet\u2019s go, love.\u201d\t</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>Steve watched Tony answer another question and the rest of the room could\u2019ve disappeared for all he cared. When the billionaire really got going in an interview, his real personality would begin to bleed through the cocky public persona. His easy going responses put even the most rowdy reporters at ease and he expertly steered conversation to topics he was comfortable with. Growing up in the spotlight had shaped him into the perfect interviewee that Steve, with his awkward shyness, could never hope to be.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2026 So sure, we disagree now and again, but it never puts a mission in jeopardy. Cap will always defer to me on aerial combat, and I\u2019ll defer to him ground combat in the end,\u201d Tony finished his answer, smiling over at Steve. Steve resisted the urge to lean over for a kiss right then.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe next question is directed at you Mr. Stark, and it was actually written by Captain America himself!\u201d The applause erupted when Steve stood. Tony met his eyes, confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 he mouthed the words. Steve only gave him a nervous smile in response.\u00a0</p><p>As the applause died down, Steve realized he couldn\u2019t back out of this now. He got down on one knee, ignoring the way the audience began screaming in excitement. Steve was focused only on Tony\u2019s reactions. The brunette\u2019s confused look slowly morphed into a scarily blank face, but Steve could see the fear in the man\u2019s eyes mixed with anxious excitement. There was so much there in the brown eyes, and maybe this had been a horrible mistake. Steve held his breath as he pulled the little box out and opened it.\t</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart had stopped. He was certain of it. What was Steve thinking!? He felt dizzy, and oh yeah, maybe he needed to breathe. He took in a shaky breath. He couldn\u2019t even tell anymore if he was ecstatic or terrified. Of course he had wanted this, more than anyone could imagine, but Steve was not thinking this through. The right wing news was going to tear them to shreds tomorrow. A hush fell over the audience, and Tony could feel the people leaning forward on their seats in anticipation, but his own gaze was locked onto the kneeling blond.\u00a0\t</p><p>\u201cAnthony Edward Stark, will you marry me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony forgot his own very valid fears when the words hit him. Steve wanted to marry him! How many times had he dreamed about this very moment? The fact that they were on live television faded away and Tony needed to keep breathing. Steve\u2019s face was so hopeful and nervous, and that made Tony want to burst out laughing. Did the man honestly think Tony could ever say no to him? He cleared his throat. \u201cYes,\u201d it came out as a whisper. \u201cYes,\u201d he said louder this time. \u201cOf course, you idiot, now get up here.\u201d\t</p><p>Tony pulled the stupidly grinning Steve off his knees and into a kiss. The audience went wild and their host was saying something about happy couples and a commercial break, but all the two men cared about was each other. Tony swore he could feel Steve\u2019s heartbeat thrumming through him. Steve smiled against his lips, trying to pull back, but Tony clutched the man\u2019s jacket tight. Steve would not escape him that easily.\t</p><p>Kimmel clearing his throat startled them both back to reality. Steve blushed a deep scarlet that matched his tie, and Tony smirked at how swollen his lips looked. \u201cWhile I understand the sentiment, gentleman, we\u2019ll be back live in a two minutes. So maybe the ring shouldn\u2019t be on the floor?\u201d He pointed to the forgotten black box Steve had dropped.\u00a0</p><p>Steve snatched the box back up, slipping the ring onto Tony\u2019s finger. When they were back in their seats, much closer together on the couch now, Tony actually looked at the ring for the first time. It was a simple silver ring with a blue stone the colour of Steve\u2019s eyes. On close inspection, the band itself had an intricate design carved into it that made reminded Tony of a circuit board. It was too perfect, and Tony was grinning at it like a smitten schoolgirl when the band and applause indicated the end of the adbreak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, Mr. Stark, show the cameras your beautiful ring!\u201d Tony held up his hand as the camera zoomed in, wiggling his fingers excitedly. \u201cIt really is something, isn\u2019t it? Captain Rogers, where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>Steve squeezed Tony\u2019s other hand in his lap. \u201cI, uh, well, I got the stone from an antique store, but I made it.\u201d Tony gaped at his fianc\u00e9. When had the man found time?\t</p><p>\u201cOh, wow!\u201d Kimmel leaned back in his chair in clear surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I knew you could make jewelry. Is this something you\u2019ve done a lot?\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled. His elation had rid him of all his usual shyness. Tony had said yes! \u201cIt\u2019s my first attempt at jewelry, I\u2019ll admit. I\u2019m not very into metalworking, Tony being the metal expert I leave it to him, but I did go to art school before I enlisted. I know a thing or two about design and aesthetic.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! I forgot about the art school. I\u2019m a bit rusty on my 1940s Steve Rogers trivia, I\u2019ll admit. I did go to your exhibit at the museum once, though.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the interview went by in a blur for the two of them. Tony wanted nothing more than to get Steve out of those clothes so he could show him how much he really appreciated the proposal. While he wasn\u2019t necessarily against jumping the man on TV, public indecency was frowned upon and whatnot. When they got home, Tony couldn\u2019t even strip immediately like he wanted, because the Avengers were waiting with a banner and surprise party. Tony and Steve grinned their way through the congratulations, making sure they spent a proper amount of time enjoying the party, but they both just wanted to be alone.</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d Tony growled after he slammed their door shut. Steve had no complaints with the fervor, only helped Tony to strip them both down as quickly as possible. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that on television,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was husky with arousal. Steve allowed him to hold him down on the bed, just watching the smaller man kiss a line down his front before gasping in surprise when Tony nipped the inside of his thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>Steve huffed. He was too distracted by the sensation of Tony\u2019s hands on him to think clearly. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be complaining,\u201d he replied dizzily. Tony teased at his tip with his tongue, and Steve hissed. His hips bucked before he could stop them, but Tony smirked up at him, victorious. He had Steve at his mercy in five minutes tops every time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m not complaining,\u201d he murmured, crawling back up to silence Steve\u2019s moan with his own mouth as he wrapped a hand around Steve\u2019s penis. He gave a lazy stroke, impressed with how quickly Steve could be so hard. He began sucking at Steve\u2019s neck, pulling his hand away to scratch ten red lines up Steve\u2019s abs and chest. The air hitting the raw skin was a perfect contrast to the moist warmth of Tony\u2019s mouth on Steve\u2019s neck. Tony pulled back to look down at Steve from above. His pupils were blown wide and Steve thought he had never looked more beautiful. \u201cYou are insane, though,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was strained, his own erection untouched so far. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to leave the tower for weeks without being harassed by reporters.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve ignored Tony\u2019s hand this time when he tried to block Steve from grabbing him. He felt Tony twitch eagerly in his grasp as he watched Tony throw his head back with a moan. Tony\u2019s sounds were always the best part for Steve. The man could make the most obscene noises, and it was the only time Steve could make him fumble his words. Steve reached into the drawer beside him, pulling out the lube. \u201cI really don\u2019t care,\u201d Steve responded before sticking a slicked finger inside his new fianc\u00e9. He grinned when Tony whined and pushed down onto the finger, already begging for more.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>Tony had been predictably correct. The next morning, every news station across TV and radio was talking about Captain America\u2019s engagement to Iron Man. Steve decided his morning run was not worth it when he saw the crowd waiting right outside the tower. He decided to ignore Tony\u2019s \u2018I told you so\u2019 smug face when he returned from the lobby and headed to the gym to use the treadmill. Tony was still in the kitchen watching another news channel an hour later.</p><p>Steve walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around Tony, who leaned back for a kiss. \u201cHow was your run?\u201d he smirked up at Steve.</p><p>Steve merely returned the smirk. \u201cStill worth it,\u201d he kissed Tony again, savoring the coffee taste. Tony returned to the news on the tablet in front of him, holding out his empty mug towards Steve. Steve shook his head fondly as he refilled the coffee before moving to make his second breakfast. \u201cHave you eaten anything today?\u201d he called behind his shoulder.</p><p>Tony only hummed in response, too focused on whatever the reporter was saying in front of him to actually listen to what Steve had asked. Steve couldn\u2019t hear anything, so the captions must be on. He gave up and decided to make Tony some food anyway, since he likely hadn\u2019t had anything besides coffee. If he didn\u2019t eat it, Clint certainly always would, so it\u2019d hardly go to waste. Tony let out a frustrated growl behind him. \u201cTony,\u201d he sighed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ignore them? That\u2019s what you normally do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d He finished his coffee and set it on the counter a little too hard. \u201cI\u2019m used to the things they say about me, but now they\u2019re saying horrible things about you! Well, mostly me still and how I must have duped you or am a bad influence but still! Fox is saying you\u2019ve betrayed you values,\u201d he looked to see why Steve had stopped making cooking noises. The blond looked much angrier than Tony was expecting. He had seem so unperturbed by it all only a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cThey said that you duped me?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was low and dangerous. \u201cThat you influence me negatively!?\u201d It rose to a near shout. Tony flinched instinctively, not used to Steve\u2019s actually angry voice in the close quarters of the small kitchen. Steve lowered his voice again, annoyed that he had made Tony flinch. \u201cJARVIS, call Anne and have her come over today if she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight on it, Captain Rogers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony gaped at the man, lost. \u201cWhy are you talking to PR? I thought the plan was to ignore them until they moved onto the next big story?\u201d He watched Steve war with himself, his face twitching with conflicting emotions. He moved forward, turned off the stovetop before Steve burned his food, and grabbed Steve\u2019s hands from underneath his crossed arms. Steve watched their hands for a moment, before meeting Tony\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat is bothering you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he reopened them he looked much calmer. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. JARVIS, can you cancel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the idea that I\u2019m somehow better than you I guess. Like why not ask if I was the one who duped you?\u201d Steve looked so sad and confused, Tony felt so heartless for the laugh that slipped past his lips unwanted. Steve pulled his hands away, irritated.</p><p>\u201cWait, no, sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to laugh,\u201d Tony started. Steve had turned back to cooking, though, and wasn\u2019t looking at Tony. \u201cSteve, please.\u201d</p><p>Steve kept cooking. \u201cGo on Tony,\u201d he said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, the idea of you duping me was really funny to me, I didn\u2019t mean to actually laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the idea of me duping you is fine?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Tony felt like he had walked into some sort of trap. That there was a wrong answer here. Maybe he should work around the question rather than answering directly. \u201cWell if one of us were better than the other, you\u2019re clearly the better one.\u201d That was the wrong answer. All of Steve\u2019s movements became sharp and harsh, slamming plates down and dumping food on them messily before throwing utensils in the sink. The clamour seemed to solidify that Tony had fucked up.\u00a0</p><p>Steve sat down at the counter, so Tony took his own seat warily. They ate in tense silence for several long minutes before Steve looked up at him again. He looked sad instead of angry. \u201cYou believe that don\u2019t you?\u201d Tony ran through the conversation again, not sure what was being asked. \u201cThat I\u2019m better than you. That you duped me.\u201d The questions had become statements.\u00a0</p><p>Tony felt like an idiot for not realizing what was bothering the man earlier. Of course it was because he thought they were equals. Tony and the rest of the world knew that Steve was a better person, but Steve had come to believe that Tony was as good as himself. Tony wasn\u2019t complaining, but he knew it wasn\u2019t true. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he spoke sincerely. He couldn\u2019t lie and tell Steve that he was wrong, but he could apologize for it.</p><p>Steve took Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you are.\u201d He kissed Tony on the forehead. \u201cI love you so much, and I will make you believe that you deserve me someday.\u201d Tony threw him a lopsided smile. He would love that to happen.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>By the time the Stark Industries Halloween Gala rolled around a few months later, the stories about Steve and Tony had died down. Here and there a piece would show up offering someone\u2019s opinion on the matter, but everyone had moved onto more important things for the most part. Like what the two engaged superheroes would be wearing to the Gala.</p><p>\u201cI really think you could pull off a dress, shellhead,\u201d Clint said at dinner that night. Thor had brought a tabloid magazine to the table with an article speculating about their attire. \u201cThen maybe the conservatives will be a little happier about Steve\u2019s gayness if you\u2019re the feminine one.\u201d\u00a0The rest of the Avengers had found the whole debacle immensely amusing. Clint especially loved to poke fun at the stories where Tony was an evil seducer that turned Captain America gay.\u00a0</p><p>Tony pretended to think about it. \u201cI suppose I could really piss them all off by shaving and wearing a wig. Though that may offend the drag or trans communities. I\u2019ve always wanted to get into drag, though. Imagine me, a drag queen. Iron maiden, I could be a dominatrix-esque drag queen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I would love to help you come up with routines!\u201d Thor enthused. It may or may not actually be one of Tony\u2019s secret dreams, but he knew he\u2019d never be able to get into it without a media shit-storm claiming he was trying to poke fun or was a bigot. Really, he wasn\u2019t sure where the idea had come about that Tony would be conservative or right-wing was beyond him. His dad may have been a capitalist douche bag, but even Howard had thought being anti-LGBTQ+ was just plain stupid. Like who cares what people do in their private lives? If it\u2019s not hurting anyone\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never realized how much I wanted to see you in drag,\u201d Natasha commented, eyeing him intensely. \u201cAnd I see Steve is on the same page,\u201d she glanced over at the blushing man, only causing his blush to deepen.\u00a0</p><p>Tony spit out his drink. \u201cWait, Steve, is it true?\u201d He turned to look at his fianc\u00e9 excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, well, I, uhm,\u201d he spluttered. \u201cI would want you to keep the goatee!\u201d he blurted out. Tony could not have found a more adorable man to marry. He pulled Steve in for a kiss, that quickly turned a bit too sexually charged for the dinner table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, God, get a room!\u201d Clint flung some peas at Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Tony ignored the projectiles, but pulled away nonetheless. \u201cI can dress in drag for you,\u201d he whispered in Steve\u2019s ear before going back to his dinner as though nothing had happened. Steve might just pass out from how red he was getting. Tony tried to keep his expression innocent, only grinning in victory inside his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have come up with a few outfit pairs for you, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Coulson spoke, dry as always, so Tony couldn\u2019t tell if he was serious. The way Clint whipped around in surprise told him that Coulson wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cI worked on it with Darcy,\u201d he said with a shrug as though that explained anything at all.\u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t deny that he was curious. \u201cI\u2019d love to see them,\u201d he told Coulson, happy to change the subject from Tony in drag. Not even he had known he wanted that until the picture had popped into his head. \u201cThe Gala is masquerade though, right?\u201d Steve turned to look at Tony.</p><p>Tony nodded. \u201cYeah, although most people only have their masks on in the beginning for pictures.\u201d He scrunched up his nose. \u201cThey get weirdly sweaty.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m adding you to our google doc, Cap,\u201d Phil said while he typed on his phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo I have to go?\u201d Bruce asked from the other end of the table? \u201cI know we were all invited, but I hate these things.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned at his best friend. \u201cWell I can hardly force you, but it\u2019d look better if the Avengers all showed up so the press doesn\u2019t come up with some stupid theory like that we\u2019re not getting along or something. Knowing them they might decide you hate that Steve and I are together. I\u2019ve seen some hilarious fan theories that you\u2019re jealous because you and me were meant to be,\u201d Tony snorted.</p><p>Bruce\u2019s cheeks turned pink. \u201cYou and me? You\u2019re not really my type.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, right!?\u201d Tony was still laughing hysterically. \u201cSo you\u2019ll come?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Bruce nodded in defeat, \u201cIf it\u2019ll keep them from theorizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u2026\u00a0</p><p>They ended up on tuxes with each other\u2019s usual colour schemes. Tony wore a light blue vest, with matching pinstripes on his pants. The tux jacket and bowtie were black with a blue shimmer that you could see only when the light hit it right. He thought it looked perfect with his engagement ring, and he used one of those blue tinted mascaras to accentuate his naturally long lashes. Now that he knew Steve had a thing for it, he finally had an excuse to start exploring some of the more feminine parts of vanity he\u2019d always wanted to, but he\u2019d start slow. There was the public to consider, of course.</p><p>Steve wore a maroon vest with a black tux, and his bow tie matched the vest. The best part, in Tony\u2019s opinion, was the gold glittery shimmer that was over the whole tux set. Tony wasn\u2019t sure how his designer friend, Janet Van Dyne, had done it, but it looked like someone had very lightly sprayed the whole thing with gold glitter spray paint. Steve\u2019s mask was an arc-reactor blue, as he called it, feathered along one side with gold feathers. Tony\u2019s was a phantom of the opera half face style white, with a red and blue gradient of tiny, sparkly stars along the outer edge. Together they looked simultaneously gorgeous and ridiculous.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did I get such a handsome fianc\u00e9?\u201d Steve asked in wonder as they headed out for the limo, already assaulted by paparazzi. The security detail for the Avengers was being handled by SHIELD and SI together given the amount of super-powered enemies they had all acquired over the years. Tony had the bracelets to call the suit if needed, Steve had the shield waiting at the gala in a closet, Clint had his foldable bow with arrows stored next to Steve\u2019s shield, Thor was always able to call Mjolnir, and Phil and Natasha were strapped with handguns and knives.</p><p>Tony grinned, waving at a couple of photographers happily. \u201cBy being a sweet, sensitive artist who throws a disc at nazis and aliens,\u201d he answered without missing a beat. Steve\u2019s resulting laugh sounded musical to his ears. He felt like he was walking on air tonight. This was their first formal public event since the engagement, and though they\u2019d of course gone on dates and missions together since, he felt like this was his first real opportunity to show off his fianc\u00e9. There was a slightly bitter thought in the back of his mind that he\u2019d like to see Howard\u2019s stupid face when he found out his beloved perfect Steve was marrying his failure son Tony, but he easily pushed it away. Steve was going to marry him, had announced it publicly, his life was perfect.\u00a0</p><p>When they arrived and stepped out of the limo, there were not only photographers, but reporters too. They stopped off to one side to answer a few questions before they got in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCaptain America, what do you say to the family values activists who say you\u2019ve gone over to the dark side and should be stripped of your title?\u201d A woman from the back shouted.</p><p>Steve took it in stride. Tony had been practicing with him for months, so he\u2019d be prepared for far worse questions than this. \u201cI say that I am sorry they are so frightened by what they don\u2019t understand. Just because a man loving another man is different than their own love lives does not make their idea of a family more valid than LGBTQ+ families, and their self-appointed cause of family values is a misguided bigotry.\u201d</p><p>Tony was so proud. \u201cDo you honestly think they\u2019re afraid of gays or is it maybe that they just hate them?\u201d A man nearby asked. Tony leaned over to whisper in Steve\u2019s ear that it was Ian Gerund, a reporter for <i>Out Magazine</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked the man in the eyes the whole time he responded, which obviously made the man a little uncomfortable. Reporters were not used to such directness with their shouted questions, as Tony had warned him. \u201cI do honestly think that. I also think there is some genuine hate out there. Hate often stems from fear, though, and as Marian Anderson, one of my favourite singers said, \u2018Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.\u2019 Our only hope is to continue to meet hate and fear with love and acceptance, but defend ourselves when attacked.\u201dThe reporters nearby had clearly not been prepared for such well thought out responses, and there was a small wave of confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark! Are you really ready to be sexually exclusive with one person \u2018til death do you part?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t help the painful tightening of his hand around Tony\u2019s. The questions directed at them were so different and obviously judgmental about the two of them and it pissed him off. Everyone was prepared for Steve to be an innocent backwards old man and for Tony to be a promiscuous conniving bastard. Tony, on the other hand, was used to it. He shot the offending reporter a wicked grin. \u201cOh, Steve is plenty sexually fulfilling to me, sweet-cheeks. Sorry you missed out on your opportunity,\u201d he finished with a wink. Steve thought that was a perfect time to leave.</p><p>\u201cSorry folks, we have people to see and dances to dance,\u201d Steve said, strained. He tugged on Tony\u2019s hand, but the man had no qualms about following anyway. He hated talking to reporters as much as Steve did. He just hid it better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did so well, babe.\u201d He pulled Steve\u2019s hands to his lips, kissing the knuckles. \u201cProud of you.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled at him, but his eyes were a little pinched. \u201cYeah, thanks for the practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, love. They\u2019ll eventually stop treating you like that. It\u2019s just hard for some people to recognize that not everyone in the 40s was straight and hated gays,\u201d Tony spoke quietly, misunderstanding the reason for the distress.</p><p>Steve kissed him, which conveniently gave him the excuse to be right at Tony\u2019s eye level as he said, \u201cI could care less how they treat me. It\u2019s how they treat you like an amoral, selfish party-boy who is going to cheat on me first chance he gets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I was for a long time,\u201d Tony reminded him. Steve didn\u2019t have a chance to respond before the greetings and small talk of the night began.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark! Captain Rogers! So good to see you.\u201d Steve didn\u2019t recognize the man, though Tony seemed to. Sometimes it seemed to Steve that Tony knew everyone in New York, though. \u201cIt really is a lovely event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Germaine, thank you for coming. I don\u2019t believe you two have actually met, this is Captain Steve Rogers, my fianc\u00e9,\u201d he used the title feeling giddy. \u201cSteve, this is Lt. Frances Germaine. We met while I was working on the Stylus project, right?\u201d</p><p>Lt. Germaine nodded. \u201cYou were showing us your new remote controls for a drone that allowed more precise aim and birdseye view so there\u2019d be less accidental civilian casualties,\u201d he reminded Tony.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh yes, hope that worked out,\u201d Tony remarked. \u201cIt was a little before Afghanistan when I was still designing while wasted so,\u201d he shrugged with his most self-deprecating smile.\u00a0</p><p>Steve frowned at Tony, but Germaine gave a knowing chuckle. \u201cIt saved numerous lives from unnecessary accidents, I assure you,\u201d he placed a comforting hand on the genius\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYou really weren\u2019t the devil people made you out to be, y\u2019know. The wake up call about SI accountability and double-dealing was important, but you should cut yourself some slack. Even as a kid you were doing good work.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave a strained smile. \u201cThanks, Lieutenant. I hope you enjoy the party.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The man caught on to the dismissal. \u201cNice to meet you, Captain.\u201d They shook hands and he departed. Tony snagged a three drinks off a roaming tray and handed one to Steve. He drained one, placing it back on the tray, and kept the other.</p><p>Before Steve could comment on the conversation that had just happened, he heard the familiar gleeful squeal of Janet. \u201cOh, boys, you look fabulous! Give me a little spin,\u201d she motioned. They obeyed, laughing. \u201cYes! Perfect! The coattails had me worried there for you Cap, your proportions are wonky. Didn\u2019t want them to look too short. Oh! Tony, darling, I haven\u2019t seen the ring in person, gimme,\u201d she held out her hand expectantly.</p><p>Tony was laughing and enjoying himself again, previous conversation with the Lieutenant long forgotten. He handed the ring over and the two started gushing about Steve\u2019s taste. Steve was still thinking about the previous conversation, so he was a little startled when the two of them were looking at him expectantly. \u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><p>Janet burst out laughing. \u201cI asked you how long it took you to make the ring?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve blushed, embarrassed. \u201cOh, only like a week after I found the right stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how long before that have you been planning to ask me?\u201d Tony asked, hand on his hip. He only got even sassier around Janet. The two together could be a nightmare sometimes. When Tony, Janet, and Clint were all three in a room, one\u2019s only hope was to flee before you got caught in their whirlwind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTwo years?\u201d Steve answered hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThat was before we had even started dating!!!\u201d Tony exclaimed.\u00a0</p><p>Steve scratched at the back of his head, not having a good response for this. He had kind of been hoping it would never cross Tony\u2019s mind to ask. \u201cYeah, I may have been in love with you and overly optimistic for a long time before we confessed to each other,\u201d he attempted to explain.</p><p>\u201cThat is the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Janet remarked. Tony just looked at him with wide eyes, feeling like he was falling in love with Steve all over again. This man was far better than he could have ever dreamed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Janet, your outfits are lovely and we need to get together soon and catch up,\u201d Tony started without looking away from Steve, \u201cbut I need to take this man to the dancefloor, <i>now</i>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I understand,\u201d Janet responded too seriously. \u201cGet on with it!\u201d She faux whispered to Steve while he was led away by Tony.</p><p>They danced to a song Steve didn\u2019t recognize, but it hardly mattered. He only had eyes for Tony and followed the man\u2019s lead. Tony had been taught to dance when he was three and it more than made up for Steve\u2019s two left feet. Tony finished his drink so he could use two hands again, placing it on the passing waiter\u2019s tray. He frowned at Steve\u2019s untouched drink before snatching it, draining it, and also placing it on said waiter\u2019s tray. The waiter scowled before he walked away. Had that been the same one as before?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had three drinks already and this is only our first dance,\u201d Steve remarked lightly. He wasn\u2019t worried. Tony hadn\u2019t gotten too drunk since they\u2019d gotten engaged. The genius seemed to only get past buzzed when he was upset or depressed.\u00a0</p><p>Tony waved him off. \u201cThree drinks is nothing for me, you know that,\u201d he smiled brightly. He wasn\u2019t wrong. Tony often didn\u2019t feel anything until the fifth drink depending on the strength, and these were just glasses of champagne. He typically drank straight liquor. \u201cI wish they\u2019d play something slower,\u201d he said casually, pulling Steve into him.</p><p>It was like it was planned, and maybe it was, Steve thought. This was a SI organized party afterall. The music shifted to a slow song, and it took Steve a until the vocals to realize it was. \u201cIs this-?\u201d he felt at a loss for words. He had never mentioned his love for Marian Anderson before.\u00a0</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips quirked sideways, a cross between a smile and a nervous squint. \u201c<i>Solitude</i>, or <i>The Jewish Girl\u2019s Song </i>as performed by Marian Anderson? Yes.\u201d</p><p>Steve felt his eyes well up with tears. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d He asked softly. Tony was up against him, head resting against Steve\u2019s chest as they slowly danced to the movement of Marian\u2019s voice. The orchestral part didn\u2019t move much, so it made more sense to set one\u2019s movements to the woman\u2019s emotional performance. Tony waited until the song finished to answer Steve\u2019s question. Steve vaguely realized that the rest of the large ballroom was full of people confused by the sudden change in language and style, but it didn\u2019t matter. They\u2019d get over it when the regular modern music returned.</p><p>\u201cWell, I may have been playing different artists in the background when you\u2019re around and gauging your reactions with JARVIS\u2019 help. We eventually narrowed down your best unconscious smiles to music that style-wise and time period led to Marian Anderson, so I figured she must be one of your faves, and then you quoted her outside and I\u2019m so glad I wasn\u2019t wrong, because sometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out what you liked from your old life and-\u201d the man was rambling nervously, and they both knew it.\u00a0</p><p>Steve placed a finger to his lips, silencing the man. \u201cEverytime I think you\u2019re done surprising me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou blow away my expectations again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony absolutely beamed at him. It had been a very long and difficult project, trying to figure out some of Steve\u2019s interests. The man was so easygoing and not picky sometimes that it was impossible to tell what he actually liked and what he just didn\u2019t mind. Tony wished Steve was a little more outspoken, but he also appreciated the little mysteries he had to work to solve about Steve. It kept the man interesting. His next project was trying to figure out the supersoldier\u2019s favourite painters and art styles for a wedding portrait, but that was still a secret. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you like it. I bought the film for the original recording of her performance at the Lincoln Memorial,\u201d Tony was actually blushing a little. He very rarely blushed. His olive italian complexion made it harder to show than Steve\u2019s pale irish white, but he also didn\u2019t have much shame anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Steve gasped in surprise, pulling Tony into him and holding on tight for a moment. The mention thrust him back to 1939 when the historic performance had been the talk of the nation. Marian had been such a big deal, paving the way for African American singers, and she got to sing at the Lincoln Memorial. Steve\u2019s mother had followed the woman\u2019s career closely, always reminding Steve that until the blacks were treated right, the immigrants had no hope. She had died only months before the Lincoln Memorial performance. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The rest of the night seemed to be going by in the background. Steve just followed his partner\u2019s lead, making small talk here and there, dancing, clapping, showing off their relationship, etc. Something at the back of his mind was bothering him, but he couldn\u2019t quite place it, so he pushed it aside and focused on Tony. The billionaire was in his element, as much as he was loathe to admit it. Tony Stark was a socialite as well as a shut-in engineer. Tony liked to convince himself that the rich celebrity persona was all a facade, and a lot of it was, but Steve could tell that the man also felt at home at these events sometimes. Now if the world worked Tony\u2019s way, there\u2019d only be one or two events a year, but if all of them suddenly disappeared, Steve thought Tony would probably miss it more than he expected.</p><p>It was when Tony placed his sixth empty champagne glass on a tray behind him that Steve realized what was bothering him. Out of the thirty or so roaming servers in the room, the same one always seemed to gravitate towards them. Tony had only come in contact with the one waiter, though he probably didn\u2019t notice at all. At first, it could\u2019ve been explained away by the staff having assigned areas of the room. By now, though, Steve and Tony had been all over the large hall, Tony being one of the main draws of the event. They had to talk to all the big SI contributors.</p><p>Tony\u2019s energy had been flagging over the last hour. He had gone from looking excited and flamboyant to looking tired and withdrawn. Steve caught him wiping a sweaty brow a few times, but until now, had only assumed it was due to the running around in a tux in a fairly hot room. No one else seemed to be sweating though. \u201cHey, wait up!\u201d Steve called out, jogging after the man until he caught up with the waiter. Tony watched him go in confusion, but stayed where he was, not wanting to seem rude while he was still trapped in conversation with one of the major shareholders in his company.\u00a0</p><p>The waiter turned to face Steve, mild surprise on his face. He looked so nondescript. An average height white male, light brown hair, probably middle aged. It was a wonder Steve had recognized him as familiar at all. That was one of Phil\u2019s assets as a SHIELD agent, looking nondescript. Steve idly wondered if being around nondescript agents enough to get to know them helped him be better at picking up on nuances within the average appearance. The man smiled politely. \u201cMay I help you with something, Captain Rogers?\u201d</p><p>Steve watched his expressions carefully. If there was anything suspicious about the man, he was good at hiding it. \u201cHave you been following us?\u201d he asked right out.</p><p>The waiter\u2019s face showed a split-second of surprise before returning to the polite smile.\u00a0Steve probably wouldn\u2019t have caught it if it weren\u2019t for Natasha\u2019s training in microexpressions. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d he pretended to be confused. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t know what set off his alarm bells, but he was sure enough of himself to be okay with making a scene. He snatched the tray from the man\u2019s hands and placed it on a nearby table. People close by started watching the strange exchange. Steve then grabbed the man\u2019s arm and twisted it painfully behind his back. \u201cDon\u2019t play stupid.\u201d He hissed into the man\u2019s ear.</p><p>A hysterical giggle tumbled from the waiter\u2019s lips. \u201cYour observational skills are as impressive as I expected,\u201d the man responded smugly. \u201cI only worry it took you too long.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound worried at all. Steve decided then and there that he hated the smug bastard.\u00a0</p><p>Slamming the man onto the same nearby table where he hat set the tray, Steve sent several glasses flying off the table or rolling and smashing loudly on the ground. A woman somewhere screamed. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cSteve! What are you doing!?\u201d Tony was marching towards them with two guards.</p><p>Steve took a steadying breath through his nose. \u201cThis man did something, Tony, I just don\u2019t know what,\u201d Steve grit out angrily. The man smirked at Steve. He was asking to get his nose broken.</p><p>Tony just looked more confused and irritated. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Let the man go, Steve.\u201d Tony placed a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but if this guy did do something, let security handle it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked back and forth between the smug bastard and his love, ignoring the awkward silence that had descended on the party while the drama unfolded. Tony was right, he didn\u2019t know what had gotten into him. He stood, pushing the waiter towards one of the guards, who caught the stumbling man easily and pinned his arms behind his back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what came over me,\u201d he murmured, head down. He had almost certainly ruined the party, and had definitely embarrassed Tony in front of the business world.\u00a0</p><p>When Tony didn\u2019t respond, he raised his head so he could see the man\u2019s expression. He was beginning to look very pale, and a bead of sweat ran down the un-masked side of his face. It seemed like a weird time for Steve to notice that they had never removed their masks like Tony said he normally did, but Steve\u2019s mind was all over the place. He stepped towards the man, \u201cTony?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time it kicked in,\u201d the smug asshole called out, and Tony turned slowly towards him, looking shocked and confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWha?\u201d Tony stepped towards him but stumbled, and Steve had to lunge to catch him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>Everyone was watching the scene unfold. Tony was in his arms looking dazed, breathing too quickly. Steve looked back at the asshole, and when they met eyes the man spoke again. \u201cHe was the problem, see? Now you can be Captain America again, unsoiled!\u201d There was a mad glint to the man\u2019s eyes. The guard holding him began dragging him away so they could question him in private. Pepper was approaching from the other direction with medics on either side of her.</p><p>Steve looked down again, terror beginning to take its icy hold on his heart. \u201cTony? Sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up at him, scared himself.\u00a0\u201cSteve? I-\u201d he shuddered in Steve\u2019s arms. \u201cI don\u2019t feel well.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d he tried to sound convincing as he laid the man on the ground for the medics to take over and examine. He stayed as close as he could so Tony could still see him. It was clear that panic was starting to take over for Tony though, and he reached out for Steve. His chest was heaving visibly.\u00a0</p><p>Steve grabbed one of the glasses he knew Tony had drank from, more thankful than he\u2019d ever been for his eidetic memory. \u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019ll be on this,\u201d he showed the medic who wasn\u2019t currently taking Tony\u2019s pulse.</p><p>\u201cGood, bring it with you,\u201d the medic commanded. \u201cWe gotta go, now.\u201d</p><p>Another two had arrived with a stretcher and they were lifting Tony onto it. Steve followed beside them, holding Tony\u2019s outstretched hand. Tony looked like he was about to say something, but instead cried out in pain and clutched at his abdomen. His breathing remained labored all the way to the helicopter, where it stopped altogether. Steve was gently pushed into a seat while they started manually inflating Tony\u2019s lungs, and Steve\u2019s world was spinning. Tony \u00a0was writhing in pain, still semi-conscious and all Steve could do was watch helplessly. When they landed at the hospital, Steve tried to stand and follow, but his knees locked in place and he was so dizzy.\u00a0</p><p>A nurse was there at his side, and when had he laid down on the ground. \u201cHey, you\u2019re okay, it\u2019s just emotional shock. Let\u2019s get you a blanket and some water, okay?\u201d The man in scrubs said. Steve nodded, allowing the man to help him into shaky legs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d he asked, hoping the guy new what he meant.\u00a0</p><p>Thankfully, he did. \u201cYou fianc\u00e9 is being taken care of right now. Thankfully, we were able to determine the poison pretty quickly with his symptoms and the residue on the glass. We\u2019re starting him on chelation. As long as he holds out a little longer, he\u2019ll make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p><i>As long as he holds out</i> is what stuck in Steve\u2019s mind. So there was still a chance Tony could die. \u201cI need to be there,\u201d he ground out, lurching forward from the chair he had been sat in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the nurse caught his arm. \u201cOkay, okay, let me take you there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve let him lead the way, and they were to Tony\u2019s bed where an IV was still being put in his arm, and the man was already intubated. Steve collapsed unceremoniously into the seat beside Tony opposite to the side the nurse was on, grabbing Tony\u2019s hand. He squeezed just tight enough to let Tony know he was there, that Tony had to pull through. The words he had spoken earlier that night were running through his head on repeat and he felt sick. <i>Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.</i>\u00a0</p><p>How could someone do something like this to someone like Tony? All in the name of \u00a0him being Captain America, \u2018unsoiled\u2019? The idea of Steve being with another man was so frightful to someone that they\u2019d poison Iron Man just to stop it? It was completely illogical and \u00a0crazy, but that was the point. Steve was terrified in this very moment, and it was coupled with a rage and illogical desire to beat the waiter to death. Such violence wouldn\u2019t help Tony survive, and it would do zero good for the world, but the idea of it alone helped assuage some of Steve\u2019s fear. Fear could truly turn the gentlest of men to inhumane acts. It shouldn\u2019t have been such a surprise to Steve, he had already seen it played out in the war, but the shock of it was real everytime he faced that reality. Tony would be okay, he had to be, but Steve would be haunted by this forever.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Summary:</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man<b> inhuman</b>.&rdquo;<b>&nbsp;</b>- Marian Anderson<br />When Steve proposes to Tony, some of the homophobic Captain America fans come out of the woodwork with a lot to say. People do dangerous things when they fear what they don&rsquo;t understand, and apparently two men in love is just too spooky for them.\n\n<br /></p><p><b><br /></b>\t&ldquo;Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.&rdquo; - Marian&nbsp;Anderson</p><p>Steve Rogers often forgot that he wasn&rsquo;t just a man. Captain America was a symbol of hope and patriotism, and the man behind the mask was often put on a pedestal. The average american who didn&rsquo;t personally know him typically had their own distinct ideas about who Steve should be. Tony tried to make the man understand that, but he never wanted to listen.\t</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter! They can think what they want but I know who I am, Tony, and I don&rsquo;t care if people like it,&rdquo; Steve shouted. The argument wasn&rsquo;t a new one, and his patience was beginning to wear thin. He understands that Tony&rsquo;s heart is in the right place, but the genius was not hearing his words.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Tony threw his hands up in frustration. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Captain fucking America!&rdquo; He ignored Steve&rsquo;s muttered &lsquo;language.&rsquo; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you care about the public opinion, the public will make themselves heard anyway. When people decide they hate something you do, they don&rsquo;t just say it, they riot. When they like what you do, they throw parades to celebrate.&rdquo; He sighed, the anger draining out of him, leaving only weariness. &ldquo;I wish I was wrong, you could cause a civil war just be saying the wrong thing, Steve. We can&rsquo;t be public.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>That was the crux of it all, wasn&rsquo;t it? Steve wanted the world to know how important Tony was to him, but Tony kept blocking his attempts to talk about their relationship to the press. Everytime a question about his love life came up, he would open his mouth to answer only for Tony to divert their attention with one of his latest scandals. Reporters would shout loudly over each other for a chance to get the great Tony Stark&rsquo;s comment on something controversial, and Steve&rsquo;s responses would be dead on his lips. Tonight was going to be the end of it. Steve had made sure of his plan. It didn&rsquo;t matter this time how much Tony tried to talk him out of it. The world would know about his feelings and his sexual orientation.\t</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 2018. Nobody is going to riot because Captain America is gay.&rdquo; Steve was done with this conversation. Tony&rsquo;s attitude was spoiling his good mood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go for a run. Be ready to leave at seven.&rdquo; He left the lab before Tony could say more. Pepper and the Avengers&rsquo; PR agent had set up the interview on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> several months back. According to them, Kimmel wanted to talk to the two of them about being the Avengers&rsquo; leaders, and how their different leadership styles meshed during missions. When Steve had called Kimmel&rsquo;s assistant with his idea last week, Jimmy himself had called him back to tell him it was a go.\t</p><p>&ldquo;The audience will love it!&rdquo; Kimmel exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw it into the middle of the interview, so there&rsquo;s time for Mr. Stark&rsquo;s reaction to play out whatever it is. When I tell him that you wrote the next question, that&rsquo;ll be your cue. Oh, I&rsquo;m so excited! My show is going to be talked about for weeks!&rdquo;\t</p><p>Steve grinned into his phone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thankful you&rsquo;re allowing it Mr. Kimmel, I&rsquo;m sorry to take away time from what you had planned.&rdquo;\t</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous! This is way better than anything my writers could come up with!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Steve checked his hair in the mirror for the fifth time. He felt like a walking flag in his navy blue suit, with red tie and white shirt, but Pepper had brow beat him into wearing it. Tony was going to be wearing a gold tie with a deep red suit and shirt. Tony loved it, but Steve wished they didn&rsquo;t have to be so obviously mimicking their uniforms. It made him feel like they weren&rsquo;t allowed to be Steve and Tony, they were only allowed to be Captain America and Iron Man. He was reminded of his fear of being a dancing monkey that had began all the war back in WWII.&nbsp;</p><p>The small black box in his pocket brought Steve back to the present. He patted the lump, taking a deep breath. He was<i> not </i>nervous. Tony was going to say yes. All Steve needed to do was ask. The question was really a formality; Steve and Tony had been promising each other eternity for awhile now. Tony wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of being with Steve. They were only a secret because Tony thought the public couldn&rsquo;t handle Steve being with a man. That was all. &nbsp;The knock on the door forced him to give up on the internal pep talk.\t</p><p>&ldquo;Steve! Happy is waiting!&rdquo;\t</p><p>Steve opened the door where Tony was still knocking. He smiled down at his handsome boyfriend, stealing a kiss. The aroma of his aftershave burned Steve&rsquo;s nostrils a little. He loved it all the same. No matter how hard Tony tried, he&rsquo;d always have the slight smell of metal and oil clinging to him that Steve loved. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, love.&rdquo;\t</p><p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve watched Tony answer another question and the rest of the room could&rsquo;ve disappeared for all he cared. When the billionaire really got going in an interview, his real personality would begin to bleed through the cocky public persona. His easy going responses put even the most rowdy reporters at ease and he expertly steered conversation to topics he was comfortable with. Growing up in the spotlight had shaped him into the perfect interviewee that Steve, with his awkward shyness, could never hope to be.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; So sure, we disagree now and again, but it never puts a mission in jeopardy. Cap will always defer to me on aerial combat, and I&rsquo;ll defer to him ground combat in the end,&rdquo; Tony finished his answer, smiling over at Steve. Steve resisted the urge to lean over for a kiss right then.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The next question is directed at you Mr. Stark, and it was actually written by Captain America himself!&rdquo; The applause erupted when Steve stood. Tony met his eyes, confused.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; he mouthed the words. Steve only gave him a nervous smile in response.&nbsp;</p><p>As the applause died down, Steve realized he couldn&rsquo;t back out of this now. He got down on one knee, ignoring the way the audience began screaming in excitement. Steve was focused only on Tony&rsquo;s reactions. The brunette&rsquo;s confused look slowly morphed into a scarily blank face, but Steve could see the fear in the man&rsquo;s eyes mixed with anxious excitement. There was so much there in the brown eyes, and maybe this had been a horrible mistake. Steve held his breath as he pulled the little box out and opened it.\t</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s heart had stopped. He was certain of it. What was Steve thinking!? He felt dizzy, and oh yeah, maybe he needed to breathe. He took in a shaky breath. He couldn&rsquo;t even tell anymore if he was ecstatic or terrified. Of course he had wanted this, more than anyone could imagine, but Steve was not thinking this through. The right wing news was going to tear them to shreds tomorrow. A hush fell over the audience, and Tony could feel the people leaning forward on their seats in anticipation, but his own gaze was locked onto the kneeling blond.&nbsp;\t</p><p>&ldquo;Anthony Edward Stark, will you marry me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony forgot his own very valid fears when the words hit him. Steve wanted to marry him! How many times had he dreamed about this very moment? The fact that they were on live television faded away and Tony needed to keep breathing. Steve&rsquo;s face was so hopeful and nervous, and that made Tony want to burst out laughing. Did the man honestly think Tony could ever say no to him? He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it came out as a whisper. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said louder this time. &ldquo;Of course, you idiot, now get up here.&rdquo;\t</p><p>Tony pulled the stupidly grinning Steve off his knees and into a kiss. The audience went wild and their host was saying something about happy couples and a commercial break, but all the two men cared about was each other. Tony swore he could feel Steve&rsquo;s heartbeat thrumming through him. Steve smiled against his lips, trying to pull back, but Tony clutched the man&rsquo;s jacket tight. Steve would not escape him that easily.\t</p><p>Kimmel clearing his throat startled them both back to reality. Steve blushed a deep scarlet that matched his tie, and Tony smirked at how swollen his lips looked. &ldquo;While I understand the sentiment, gentleman, we&rsquo;ll be back live in a two minutes. So maybe the ring shouldn&rsquo;t be on the floor?&rdquo; He pointed to the forgotten black box Steve had dropped.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve snatched the box back up, slipping the ring onto Tony&rsquo;s finger. When they were back in their seats, much closer together on the couch now, Tony actually looked at the ring for the first time. It was a simple silver ring with a blue stone the colour of Steve&rsquo;s eyes. On close inspection, the band itself had an intricate design carved into it that made reminded Tony of a circuit board. It was too perfect, and Tony was grinning at it like a smitten schoolgirl when the band and applause indicated the end of the adbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, Mr. Stark, show the cameras your beautiful ring!&rdquo; Tony held up his hand as the camera zoomed in, wiggling his fingers excitedly. &ldquo;It really is something, isn&rsquo;t it? Captain Rogers, where did you get it?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve squeezed Tony&rsquo;s other hand in his lap. &ldquo;I, uh, well, I got the stone from an antique store, but I made it.&rdquo; Tony gaped at his fianc&eacute;. When had the man found time?\t</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, wow!&rdquo; Kimmel leaned back in his chair in clear surprise. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I knew you could make jewelry. Is this something you&rsquo;ve done a lot?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve chuckled. His elation had rid him of all his usual shyness. Tony had said yes! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first attempt at jewelry, I&rsquo;ll admit. I&rsquo;m not very into metalworking, Tony being the metal expert I leave it to him, but I did go to art school before I enlisted. I know a thing or two about design and aesthetic.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! I forgot about the art school. I&rsquo;m a bit rusty on my 1940s Steve Rogers trivia, I&rsquo;ll admit. I did go to your exhibit at the museum once, though.&rdquo;</p><p>The rest of the interview went by in a blur for the two of them. Tony wanted nothing more than to get Steve out of those clothes so he could show him how much he really appreciated the proposal. While he wasn&rsquo;t necessarily against jumping the man on TV, public indecency was frowned upon and whatnot. When they got home, Tony couldn&rsquo;t even strip immediately like he wanted, because the Avengers were waiting with a banner and surprise party. Tony and Steve grinned their way through the congratulations, making sure they spent a proper amount of time enjoying the party, but they both just wanted to be alone.</p><p>&ldquo;Finally!&rdquo; Tony growled after he slammed their door shut. Steve had no complaints with the fervor, only helped Tony to strip them both down as quickly as possible. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you did that on television,&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice was husky with arousal. Steve allowed him to hold him down on the bed, just watching the smaller man kiss a line down his front before gasping in surprise when Tony nipped the inside of his thigh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve huffed. He was too distracted by the sensation of Tony&rsquo;s hands on him to think clearly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be complaining,&rdquo; he replied dizzily. Tony teased at his tip with his tongue, and Steve hissed. His hips bucked before he could stop them, but Tony smirked up at him, victorious. He had Steve at his mercy in five minutes tops every time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m not complaining,&rdquo; he murmured, crawling back up to silence Steve&rsquo;s moan with his own mouth as he wrapped a hand around Steve&rsquo;s penis. He gave a lazy stroke, impressed with how quickly Steve could be so hard. He began sucking at Steve&rsquo;s neck, pulling his hand away to scratch ten red lines up Steve&rsquo;s abs and chest. The air hitting the raw skin was a perfect contrast to the moist warmth of Tony&rsquo;s mouth on Steve&rsquo;s neck. Tony pulled back to look down at Steve from above. His pupils were blown wide and Steve thought he had never looked more beautiful. &ldquo;You are insane, though,&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice was strained, his own erection untouched so far. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to be able to leave the tower for weeks without being harassed by reporters.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve ignored Tony&rsquo;s hand this time when he tried to block Steve from grabbing him. He felt Tony twitch eagerly in his grasp as he watched Tony throw his head back with a moan. Tony&rsquo;s sounds were always the best part for Steve. The man could make the most obscene noises, and it was the only time Steve could make him fumble his words. Steve reached into the drawer beside him, pulling out the lube. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Steve responded before sticking a slicked finger inside his new fianc&eacute;. He grinned when Tony whined and pushed down onto the finger, already begging for more.&nbsp;</p><p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony had been predictably correct. The next morning, every news station across TV and radio was talking about Captain America&rsquo;s engagement to Iron Man. Steve decided his morning run was not worth it when he saw the crowd waiting right outside the tower. He decided to ignore Tony&rsquo;s &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo; smug face when he returned from the lobby and headed to the gym to use the treadmill. Tony was still in the kitchen watching another news channel an hour later.</p><p>Steve walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around Tony, who leaned back for a kiss. &ldquo;How was your run?&rdquo; he smirked up at Steve.</p><p>Steve merely returned the smirk. &ldquo;Still worth it,&rdquo; he kissed Tony again, savoring the coffee taste. Tony returned to the news on the tablet in front of him, holding out his empty mug towards Steve. Steve shook his head fondly as he refilled the coffee before moving to make his second breakfast. &ldquo;Have you eaten anything today?&rdquo; he called behind his shoulder.</p><p>Tony only hummed in response, too focused on whatever the reporter was saying in front of him to actually listen to what Steve had asked. Steve couldn&rsquo;t hear anything, so the captions must be on. He gave up and decided to make Tony some food anyway, since he likely hadn&rsquo;t had anything besides coffee. If he didn&rsquo;t eat it, Clint certainly always would, so it&rsquo;d hardly go to waste. Tony let out a frustrated growl behind him. &ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just ignore them? That&rsquo;s what you normally do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; He finished his coffee and set it on the counter a little too hard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to the things they say about me, but now they&rsquo;re saying horrible things about you! Well, mostly me still and how I must have duped you or am a bad influence but still! Fox is saying you&rsquo;ve betrayed you values,&rdquo; he looked to see why Steve had stopped making cooking noises. The blond looked much angrier than Tony was expecting. He had seem so unperturbed by it all only a moment ago.</p><p>&ldquo;They said that you duped me?&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice was low and dangerous. &ldquo;That you influence me negatively!?&rdquo; It rose to a near shout. Tony flinched instinctively, not used to Steve&rsquo;s actually angry voice in the close quarters of the small kitchen. Steve lowered his voice again, annoyed that he had made Tony flinch. &ldquo;JARVIS, call Anne and have her come over today if she can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right on it, Captain Rogers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony gaped at the man, lost. &ldquo;Why are you talking to PR? I thought the plan was to ignore them until they moved onto the next big story?&rdquo; He watched Steve war with himself, his face twitching with conflicting emotions. He moved forward, turned off the stovetop before Steve burned his food, and grabbed Steve&rsquo;s hands from underneath his crossed arms. Steve watched their hands for a moment, before meeting Tony&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;What is bothering you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he reopened them he looked much calmer. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. JARVIS, can you cancel that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the idea that I&rsquo;m somehow better than you I guess. Like why not ask if I was the one who duped you?&rdquo; Steve looked so sad and confused, Tony felt so heartless for the laugh that slipped past his lips unwanted. Steve pulled his hands away, irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, no, sorry! I didn&rsquo;t mean to laugh,&rdquo; Tony started. Steve had turned back to cooking, though, and wasn&rsquo;t looking at Tony. &ldquo;Steve, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve kept cooking. &ldquo;Go on Tony,&rdquo; he said tiredly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, the idea of you duping me was really funny to me, I didn&rsquo;t mean to actually laugh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the idea of me duping you is fine?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>Tony felt like he had walked into some sort of trap. That there was a wrong answer here. Maybe he should work around the question rather than answering directly. &ldquo;Well if one of us were better than the other, you&rsquo;re clearly the better one.&rdquo; That was the wrong answer. All of Steve&rsquo;s movements became sharp and harsh, slamming plates down and dumping food on them messily before throwing utensils in the sink. The clamour seemed to solidify that Tony had fucked up.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve sat down at the counter, so Tony took his own seat warily. They ate in tense silence for several long minutes before Steve looked up at him again. He looked sad instead of angry. &ldquo;You believe that don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Tony ran through the conversation again, not sure what was being asked. &ldquo;That I&rsquo;m better than you. That you duped me.&rdquo; The questions had become statements.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony felt like an idiot for not realizing what was bothering the man earlier. Of course it was because he thought they were equals. Tony and the rest of the world knew that Steve was a better person, but Steve had come to believe that Tony was as good as himself. Tony wasn&rsquo;t complaining, but he knew it wasn&rsquo;t true. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he spoke sincerely. He couldn&rsquo;t lie and tell Steve that he was wrong, but he could apologize for it.</p><p>Steve took Tony&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I know you are.&rdquo; He kissed Tony on the forehead. &ldquo;I love you so much, and I will make you believe that you deserve me someday.&rdquo; Tony threw him a lopsided smile. He would love that to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>By the time the Stark Industries Halloween Gala rolled around a few months later, the stories about Steve and Tony had died down. Here and there a piece would show up offering someone&rsquo;s opinion on the matter, but everyone had moved onto more important things for the most part. Like what the two engaged superheroes would be wearing to the Gala.</p><p>&ldquo;I really think you could pull off a dress, shellhead,&rdquo; Clint said at dinner that night. Thor had brought a tabloid magazine to the table with an article speculating about their attire. &ldquo;Then maybe the conservatives will be a little happier about Steve&rsquo;s gayness if you&rsquo;re the feminine one.&rdquo;&nbsp;The rest of the Avengers had found the whole debacle immensely amusing. Clint especially loved to poke fun at the stories where Tony was an evil seducer that turned Captain America gay.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony pretended to think about it. &ldquo;I suppose I could really piss them all off by shaving and wearing a wig. Though that may offend the drag or trans communities. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to get into drag, though. Imagine me, a drag queen. Iron maiden, I could be a dominatrix-esque drag queen!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I would love to help you come up with routines!&rdquo; Thor enthused. It may or may not actually be one of Tony&rsquo;s secret dreams, but he knew he&rsquo;d never be able to get into it without a media shit-storm claiming he was trying to poke fun or was a bigot. Really, he wasn&rsquo;t sure where the idea had come about that Tony would be conservative or right-wing was beyond him. His dad may have been a capitalist douche bag, but even Howard had thought being anti-LGBTQ+ was just plain stupid. Like who cares what people do in their private lives? If it&rsquo;s not hurting anyone&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I never realized how much I wanted to see you in drag,&rdquo; Natasha commented, eyeing him intensely. &ldquo;And I see Steve is on the same page,&rdquo; she glanced over at the blushing man, only causing his blush to deepen.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony spit out his drink. &ldquo;Wait, Steve, is it true?&rdquo; He turned to look at his fianc&eacute; excitedly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I, well, I, uhm,&rdquo; he spluttered. &ldquo;I would want you to keep the goatee!&rdquo; he blurted out. Tony could not have found a more adorable man to marry. He pulled Steve in for a kiss, that quickly turned a bit too sexually charged for the dinner table.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, God, get a room!&rdquo; Clint flung some peas at Tony.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony ignored the projectiles, but pulled away nonetheless. &ldquo;I can dress in drag for you,&rdquo; he whispered in Steve&rsquo;s ear before going back to his dinner as though nothing had happened. Steve might just pass out from how red he was getting. Tony tried to keep his expression innocent, only grinning in victory inside his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have come up with a few outfit pairs for you, if you&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; Coulson spoke, dry as always, so Tony couldn&rsquo;t tell if he was serious. The way Clint whipped around in surprise told him that Coulson wasn&rsquo;t joking. &ldquo;I worked on it with Darcy,&rdquo; he said with a shrug as though that explained anything at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve couldn&rsquo;t deny that he was curious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see them,&rdquo; he told Coulson, happy to change the subject from Tony in drag. Not even he had known he wanted that until the picture had popped into his head. &ldquo;The Gala is masquerade though, right?&rdquo; Steve turned to look at Tony.</p><p>Tony nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, although most people only have their masks on in the beginning for pictures.&rdquo; He scrunched up his nose. &ldquo;They get weirdly sweaty.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m adding you to our google doc, Cap,&rdquo; Phil said while he typed on his phone.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do I have to go?&rdquo; Bruce asked from the other end of the table? &ldquo;I know we were all invited, but I hate these things.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony frowned at his best friend. &ldquo;Well I can hardly force you, but it&rsquo;d look better if the Avengers all showed up so the press doesn&rsquo;t come up with some stupid theory like that we&rsquo;re not getting along or something. Knowing them they might decide you hate that Steve and I are together. I&rsquo;ve seen some hilarious fan theories that you&rsquo;re jealous because you and me were meant to be,&rdquo; Tony snorted.</p><p>Bruce&rsquo;s cheeks turned pink. &ldquo;You and me? You&rsquo;re not really my type.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, right!?&rdquo; Tony was still laughing hysterically. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll come?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce nodded in defeat, &ldquo;If it&rsquo;ll keep them from theorizing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>They ended up on tuxes with each other&rsquo;s usual colour schemes. Tony wore a light blue vest, with matching pinstripes on his pants. The tux jacket and bowtie were black with a blue shimmer that you could see only when the light hit it right. He thought it looked perfect with his engagement ring, and he used one of those blue tinted mascaras to accentuate his naturally long lashes. Now that he knew Steve had a thing for it, he finally had an excuse to start exploring some of the more feminine parts of vanity he&rsquo;d always wanted to, but he&rsquo;d start slow. There was the public to consider, of course.</p><p>Steve wore a maroon vest with a black tux, and his bow tie matched the vest. The best part, in Tony&rsquo;s opinion, was the gold glittery shimmer that was over the whole tux set. Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure how his designer friend, Janet Van Dyne, had done it, but it looked like someone had very lightly sprayed the whole thing with gold glitter spray paint. Steve&rsquo;s mask was an arc-reactor blue, as he called it, feathered along one side with gold feathers. Tony&rsquo;s was a phantom of the opera half face style white, with a red and blue gradient of tiny, sparkly stars along the outer edge. Together they looked simultaneously gorgeous and ridiculous.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How did I get such a handsome fianc&eacute;?&rdquo; Steve asked in wonder as they headed out for the limo, already assaulted by paparazzi. The security detail for the Avengers was being handled by SHIELD and SI together given the amount of super-powered enemies they had all acquired over the years. Tony had the bracelets to call the suit if needed, Steve had the shield waiting at the gala in a closet, Clint had his foldable bow with arrows stored next to Steve&rsquo;s shield, Thor was always able to call Mjolnir, and Phil and Natasha were strapped with handguns and knives.</p><p>Tony grinned, waving at a couple of photographers happily. &ldquo;By being a sweet, sensitive artist who throws a disc at nazis and aliens,&rdquo; he answered without missing a beat. Steve&rsquo;s resulting laugh sounded musical to his ears. He felt like he was walking on air tonight. This was their first formal public event since the engagement, and though they&rsquo;d of course gone on dates and missions together since, he felt like this was his first real opportunity to show off his fianc&eacute;. There was a slightly bitter thought in the back of his mind that he&rsquo;d like to see Howard&rsquo;s stupid face when he found out his beloved perfect Steve was marrying his failure son Tony, but he easily pushed it away. Steve was going to marry him, had announced it publicly, his life was perfect.&nbsp;</p><p>When they arrived and stepped out of the limo, there were not only photographers, but reporters too. They stopped off to one side to answer a few questions before they got in.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Captain America, what do you say to the family values activists who say you&rsquo;ve gone over to the dark side and should be stripped of your title?&rdquo; A woman from the back shouted.</p><p>Steve took it in stride. Tony had been practicing with him for months, so he&rsquo;d be prepared for far worse questions than this. &ldquo;I say that I am sorry they are so frightened by what they don&rsquo;t understand. Just because a man loving another man is different than their own love lives does not make their idea of a family more valid than LGBTQ+ families, and their self-appointed cause of family values is a misguided bigotry.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony was so proud. &ldquo;Do you honestly think they&rsquo;re afraid of gays or is it maybe that they just hate them?&rdquo; A man nearby asked. Tony leaned over to whisper in Steve&rsquo;s ear that it was Ian Gerund, a reporter for <i>Out Magazine</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve looked the man in the eyes the whole time he responded, which obviously made the man a little uncomfortable. Reporters were not used to such directness with their shouted questions, as Tony had warned him. &ldquo;I do honestly think that. I also think there is some genuine hate out there. Hate often stems from fear, though, and as Marian Anderson, one of my favourite singers said, &lsquo;Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.&rsquo; Our only hope is to continue to meet hate and fear with love and acceptance, but defend ourselves when attacked.&rdquo;The reporters nearby had clearly not been prepared for such well thought out responses, and there was a small wave of confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark! Are you really ready to be sexually exclusive with one person &lsquo;til death do you part?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve couldn&rsquo;t help the painful tightening of his hand around Tony&rsquo;s. The questions directed at them were so different and obviously judgmental about the two of them and it pissed him off. Everyone was prepared for Steve to be an innocent backwards old man and for Tony to be a promiscuous conniving bastard. Tony, on the other hand, was used to it. He shot the offending reporter a wicked grin. &ldquo;Oh, Steve is plenty sexually fulfilling to me, sweet-cheeks. Sorry you missed out on your opportunity,&rdquo; he finished with a wink. Steve thought that was a perfect time to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry folks, we have people to see and dances to dance,&rdquo; Steve said, strained. He tugged on Tony&rsquo;s hand, but the man had no qualms about following anyway. He hated talking to reporters as much as Steve did. He just hid it better.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You did so well, babe.&rdquo; He pulled Steve&rsquo;s hands to his lips, kissing the knuckles. &ldquo;Proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled at him, but his eyes were a little pinched. &ldquo;Yeah, thanks for the practice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, love. They&rsquo;ll eventually stop treating you like that. It&rsquo;s just hard for some people to recognize that not everyone in the 40s was straight and hated gays,&rdquo; Tony spoke quietly, misunderstanding the reason for the distress.</p><p>Steve kissed him, which conveniently gave him the excuse to be right at Tony&rsquo;s eye level as he said, &ldquo;I could care less how they treat me. It&rsquo;s how they treat you like an amoral, selfish party-boy who is going to cheat on me first chance he gets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I was for a long time,&rdquo; Tony reminded him. Steve didn&rsquo;t have a chance to respond before the greetings and small talk of the night began.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark! Captain Rogers! So good to see you.&rdquo; Steve didn&rsquo;t recognize the man, though Tony seemed to. Sometimes it seemed to Steve that Tony knew everyone in New York, though. &ldquo;It really is a lovely event.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Germaine, thank you for coming. I don&rsquo;t believe you two have actually met, this is Captain Steve Rogers, my fianc&eacute;,&rdquo; he used the title feeling giddy. &ldquo;Steve, this is Lt. Frances Germaine. We met while I was working on the Stylus project, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Lt. Germaine nodded. &ldquo;You were showing us your new remote controls for a drone that allowed more precise aim and birdseye view so there&rsquo;d be less accidental civilian casualties,&rdquo; he reminded Tony.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yes, hope that worked out,&rdquo; Tony remarked. &ldquo;It was a little before Afghanistan when I was still designing while wasted so,&rdquo; he shrugged with his most self-deprecating smile.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve frowned at Tony, but Germaine gave a knowing chuckle. &ldquo;It saved numerous lives from unnecessary accidents, I assure you,&rdquo; he placed a comforting hand on the genius&rsquo; shoulder. &ldquo;You really weren&rsquo;t the devil people made you out to be, y&rsquo;know. The wake up call about SI accountability and double-dealing was important, but you should cut yourself some slack. Even as a kid you were doing good work.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gave a strained smile. &ldquo;Thanks, Lieutenant. I hope you enjoy the party.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The man caught on to the dismissal. &ldquo;Nice to meet you, Captain.&rdquo; They shook hands and he departed. Tony snagged a three drinks off a roaming tray and handed one to Steve. He drained one, placing it back on the tray, and kept the other.</p><p>Before Steve could comment on the conversation that had just happened, he heard the familiar gleeful squeal of Janet. &ldquo;Oh, boys, you look fabulous! Give me a little spin,&rdquo; she motioned. They obeyed, laughing. &ldquo;Yes! Perfect! The coattails had me worried there for you Cap, your proportions are wonky. Didn&rsquo;t want them to look too short. Oh! Tony, darling, I haven&rsquo;t seen the ring in person, gimme,&rdquo; she held out her hand expectantly.</p><p>Tony was laughing and enjoying himself again, previous conversation with the Lieutenant long forgotten. He handed the ring over and the two started gushing about Steve&rsquo;s taste. Steve was still thinking about the previous conversation, so he was a little startled when the two of them were looking at him expectantly. &ldquo;Huh? What?&rdquo;</p><p>Janet burst out laughing. &ldquo;I asked you how long it took you to make the ring?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve blushed, embarrassed. &ldquo;Oh, only like a week after I found the right stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So how long before that have you been planning to ask me?&rdquo; Tony asked, hand on his hip. He only got even sassier around Janet. The two together could be a nightmare sometimes. When Tony, Janet, and Clint were all three in a room, one&rsquo;s only hope was to flee before you got caught in their whirlwind.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Two years?&rdquo; Steve answered hesitantly.</p><p>&ldquo;That was before we had even started dating!!!&rdquo; Tony exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve scratched at the back of his head, not having a good response for this. He had kind of been hoping it would never cross Tony&rsquo;s mind to ask. &ldquo;Yeah, I may have been in love with you and overly optimistic for a long time before we confessed to each other,&rdquo; he attempted to explain.</p><p>&ldquo;That is the cutest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard,&rdquo; Janet remarked. Tony just looked at him with wide eyes, feeling like he was falling in love with Steve all over again. This man was far better than he could have ever dreamed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Janet, your outfits are lovely and we need to get together soon and catch up,&rdquo; Tony started without looking away from Steve, &ldquo;but I need to take this man to the dancefloor, <i>now</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I understand,&rdquo; Janet responded too seriously. &ldquo;Get on with it!&rdquo; She faux whispered to Steve while he was led away by Tony.</p><p>They danced to a song Steve didn&rsquo;t recognize, but it hardly mattered. He only had eyes for Tony and followed the man&rsquo;s lead. Tony had been taught to dance when he was three and it more than made up for Steve&rsquo;s two left feet. Tony finished his drink so he could use two hands again, placing it on the passing waiter&rsquo;s tray. He frowned at Steve&rsquo;s untouched drink before snatching it, draining it, and also placing it on said waiter&rsquo;s tray. The waiter scowled before he walked away. Had that been the same one as before?</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had three drinks already and this is only our first dance,&rdquo; Steve remarked lightly. He wasn&rsquo;t worried. Tony hadn&rsquo;t gotten too drunk since they&rsquo;d gotten engaged. The genius seemed to only get past buzzed when he was upset or depressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony waved him off. &ldquo;Three drinks is nothing for me, you know that,&rdquo; he smiled brightly. He wasn&rsquo;t wrong. Tony often didn&rsquo;t feel anything until the fifth drink depending on the strength, and these were just glasses of champagne. He typically drank straight liquor. &ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d play something slower,&rdquo; he said casually, pulling Steve into him.</p><p>It was like it was planned, and maybe it was, Steve thought. This was a SI organized party afterall. The music shifted to a slow song, and it took Steve a until the vocals to realize it was. &ldquo;Is this-?&rdquo; he felt at a loss for words. He had never mentioned his love for Marian Anderson before.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s lips quirked sideways, a cross between a smile and a nervous squint. &ldquo;<i>Solitude</i>, or <i>The Jewish Girl&rsquo;s Song </i>as performed by Marian Anderson? Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve felt his eyes well up with tears. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; He asked softly. Tony was up against him, head resting against Steve&rsquo;s chest as they slowly danced to the movement of Marian&rsquo;s voice. The orchestral part didn&rsquo;t move much, so it made more sense to set one&rsquo;s movements to the woman&rsquo;s emotional performance. Tony waited until the song finished to answer Steve&rsquo;s question. Steve vaguely realized that the rest of the large ballroom was full of people confused by the sudden change in language and style, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. They&rsquo;d get over it when the regular modern music returned.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I may have been playing different artists in the background when you&rsquo;re around and gauging your reactions with JARVIS&rsquo; help. We eventually narrowed down your best unconscious smiles to music that style-wise and time period led to Marian Anderson, so I figured she must be one of your faves, and then you quoted her outside and I&rsquo;m so glad I wasn&rsquo;t wrong, because sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to figure out what you liked from your old life and-&rdquo; the man was rambling nervously, and they both knew it.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve placed a finger to his lips, silencing the man. &ldquo;Everytime I think you&rsquo;re done surprising me,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;You blow away my expectations again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony absolutely beamed at him. It had been a very long and difficult project, trying to figure out some of Steve&rsquo;s interests. The man was so easygoing and not picky sometimes that it was impossible to tell what he actually liked and what he just didn&rsquo;t mind. Tony wished Steve was a little more outspoken, but he also appreciated the little mysteries he had to work to solve about Steve. It kept the man interesting. His next project was trying to figure out the supersoldier&rsquo;s favourite painters and art styles for a wedding portrait, but that was still a secret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you like it. I bought the film for the original recording of her performance at the Lincoln Memorial,&rdquo; Tony was actually blushing a little. He very rarely blushed. His olive italian complexion made it harder to show than Steve&rsquo;s pale irish white, but he also didn&rsquo;t have much shame anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve gasped in surprise, pulling Tony into him and holding on tight for a moment. The mention thrust him back to 1939 when the historic performance had been the talk of the nation. Marian had been such a big deal, paving the way for African American singers, and she got to sing at the Lincoln Memorial. Steve&rsquo;s mother had followed the woman&rsquo;s career closely, always reminding Steve that until the blacks were treated right, the immigrants had no hope. She had died only months before the Lincoln Memorial performance. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>The rest of the night seemed to be going by in the background. Steve just followed his partner&rsquo;s lead, making small talk here and there, dancing, clapping, showing off their relationship, etc. Something at the back of his mind was bothering him, but he couldn&rsquo;t quite place it, so he pushed it aside and focused on Tony. The billionaire was in his element, as much as he was loathe to admit it. Tony Stark was a socialite as well as a shut-in engineer. Tony liked to convince himself that the rich celebrity persona was all a facade, and a lot of it was, but Steve could tell that the man also felt at home at these events sometimes. Now if the world worked Tony&rsquo;s way, there&rsquo;d only be one or two events a year, but if all of them suddenly disappeared, Steve thought Tony would probably miss it more than he expected.</p><p>It was when Tony placed his sixth empty champagne glass on a tray behind him that Steve realized what was bothering him. Out of the thirty or so roaming servers in the room, the same one always seemed to gravitate towards them. Tony had only come in contact with the one waiter, though he probably didn&rsquo;t notice at all. At first, it could&rsquo;ve been explained away by the staff having assigned areas of the room. By now, though, Steve and Tony had been all over the large hall, Tony being one of the main draws of the event. They had to talk to all the big SI contributors.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s energy had been flagging over the last hour. He had gone from looking excited and flamboyant to looking tired and withdrawn. Steve caught him wiping a sweaty brow a few times, but until now, had only assumed it was due to the running around in a tux in a fairly hot room. No one else seemed to be sweating though. &ldquo;Hey, wait up!&rdquo; Steve called out, jogging after the man until he caught up with the waiter. Tony watched him go in confusion, but stayed where he was, not wanting to seem rude while he was still trapped in conversation with one of the major shareholders in his company.&nbsp;</p><p>The waiter turned to face Steve, mild surprise on his face. He looked so nondescript. An average height white male, light brown hair, probably middle aged. It was a wonder Steve had recognized him as familiar at all. That was one of Phil&rsquo;s assets as a SHIELD agent, looking nondescript. Steve idly wondered if being around nondescript agents enough to get to know them helped him be better at picking up on nuances within the average appearance. The man smiled politely. &ldquo;May I help you with something, Captain Rogers?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve watched his expressions carefully. If there was anything suspicious about the man, he was good at hiding it. &ldquo;Have you been following us?&rdquo; he asked right out.</p><p>The waiter&rsquo;s face showed a split-second of surprise before returning to the polite smile.&nbsp;Steve probably wouldn&rsquo;t have caught it if it weren&rsquo;t for Natasha&rsquo;s training in microexpressions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo; he pretended to be confused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve didn&rsquo;t know what set off his alarm bells, but he was sure enough of himself to be okay with making a scene. He snatched the tray from the man&rsquo;s hands and placed it on a nearby table. People close by started watching the strange exchange. Steve then grabbed the man&rsquo;s arm and twisted it painfully behind his back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play stupid.&rdquo; He hissed into the man&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>A hysterical giggle tumbled from the waiter&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Your observational skills are as impressive as I expected,&rdquo; the man responded smugly. &ldquo;I only worry it took you too long.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t sound worried at all. Steve decided then and there that he hated the smug bastard.&nbsp;</p><p>Slamming the man onto the same nearby table where he hat set the tray, Steve sent several glasses flying off the table or rolling and smashing loudly on the ground. A woman somewhere screamed. &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve! What are you doing!?&rdquo; Tony was marching towards them with two guards.</p><p>Steve took a steadying breath through his nose. &ldquo;This man did something, Tony, I just don&rsquo;t know what,&rdquo; Steve grit out angrily. The man smirked at Steve. He was asking to get his nose broken.</p><p>Tony just looked more confused and irritated. &ldquo;What are you talking about? Let the man go, Steve.&rdquo; Tony placed a hand on Steve&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on, but if this guy did do something, let security handle it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve looked back and forth between the smug bastard and his love, ignoring the awkward silence that had descended on the party while the drama unfolded. Tony was right, he didn&rsquo;t know what had gotten into him. He stood, pushing the waiter towards one of the guards, who caught the stumbling man easily and pinned his arms behind his back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what came over me,&rdquo; he murmured, head down. He had almost certainly ruined the party, and had definitely embarrassed Tony in front of the business world.&nbsp;</p><p>When Tony didn&rsquo;t respond, he raised his head so he could see the man&rsquo;s expression. He was beginning to look very pale, and a bead of sweat ran down the un-masked side of his face. It seemed like a weird time for Steve to notice that they had never removed their masks like Tony said he normally did, but Steve&rsquo;s mind was all over the place. He stepped towards the man, &ldquo;Tony?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time it kicked in,&rdquo; the smug asshole called out, and Tony turned slowly towards him, looking shocked and confused.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wha?&rdquo; Tony stepped towards him but stumbled, and Steve had to lunge to catch him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone was watching the scene unfold. Tony was in his arms looking dazed, breathing too quickly. Steve looked back at the asshole, and when they met eyes the man spoke again. &ldquo;He was the problem, see? Now you can be Captain America again, unsoiled!&rdquo; There was a mad glint to the man&rsquo;s eyes. The guard holding him began dragging him away so they could question him in private. Pepper was approaching from the other direction with medics on either side of her.</p><p>Steve looked down again, terror beginning to take its icy hold on his heart. &ldquo;Tony? Sweetheart?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked up at him, scared himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;Steve? I-&rdquo; he shuddered in Steve&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be okay,&rdquo; he tried to sound convincing as he laid the man on the ground for the medics to take over and examine. He stayed as close as he could so Tony could still see him. It was clear that panic was starting to take over for Tony though, and he reached out for Steve. His chest was heaving visibly.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve grabbed one of the glasses he knew Tony had drank from, more thankful than he&rsquo;d ever been for his eidetic memory. &ldquo;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;ll be on this,&rdquo; he showed the medic who wasn&rsquo;t currently taking Tony&rsquo;s pulse.</p><p>&ldquo;Good, bring it with you,&rdquo; the medic commanded. &ldquo;We gotta go, now.&rdquo;</p><p>Another two had arrived with a stretcher and they were lifting Tony onto it. Steve followed beside them, holding Tony&rsquo;s outstretched hand. Tony looked like he was about to say something, but instead cried out in pain and clutched at his abdomen. His breathing remained labored all the way to the helicopter, where it stopped altogether. Steve was gently pushed into a seat while they started manually inflating Tony&rsquo;s lungs, and Steve&rsquo;s world was spinning. Tony &nbsp;was writhing in pain, still semi-conscious and all Steve could do was watch helplessly. When they landed at the hospital, Steve tried to stand and follow, but his knees locked in place and he was so dizzy.&nbsp;</p><p>A nurse was there at his side, and when had he laid down on the ground. &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re okay, it&rsquo;s just emotional shock. Let&rsquo;s get you a blanket and some water, okay?&rdquo; The man in scrubs said. Steve nodded, allowing the man to help him into shaky legs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; he asked, hoping the guy new what he meant.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, he did. &ldquo;You fianc&eacute; is being taken care of right now. Thankfully, we were able to determine the poison pretty quickly with his symptoms and the residue on the glass. We&rsquo;re starting him on chelation. As long as he holds out a little longer, he&rsquo;ll make a full recovery.&rdquo;</p><p><i>As long as he holds out</i> is what stuck in Steve&rsquo;s mind. So there was still a chance Tony could die. &ldquo;I need to be there,&rdquo; he ground out, lurching forward from the chair he had been sat in.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; the nurse caught his arm. &ldquo;Okay, okay, let me take you there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve let him lead the way, and they were to Tony&rsquo;s bed where an IV was still being put in his arm, and the man was already intubated. Steve collapsed unceremoniously into the seat beside Tony opposite to the side the nurse was on, grabbing Tony&rsquo;s hand. He squeezed just tight enough to let Tony know he was there, that Tony had to pull through. The words he had spoken earlier that night were running through his head on repeat and he felt sick. <i>Fear is a disease that eats away at logic and makes man inhuman.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>How could someone do something like this to someone like Tony? All in the name of &nbsp;him being Captain America, &lsquo;unsoiled&rsquo;? The idea of Steve being with another man was so frightful to someone that they&rsquo;d poison Iron Man just to stop it? It was completely illogical and &nbsp;crazy, but that was the point. Steve was terrified in this very moment, and it was coupled with a rage and illogical desire to beat the waiter to death. Such violence wouldn&rsquo;t help Tony survive, and it would do zero good for the world, but the idea of it alone helped assuage some of Steve&rsquo;s fear. Fear could truly turn the gentlest of men to inhumane acts. It shouldn&rsquo;t have been such a surprise to Steve, he had already seen it played out in the war, but the shock of it was real everytime he faced that reality. Tony would be okay, he had to be, but Steve would be haunted by this forever.</p>",
