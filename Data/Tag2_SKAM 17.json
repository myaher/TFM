He&rsquo;s not just a clown and a goofy character, and I remember\nhow some people in the fandom started liking him a lot after that moment,\nbecause we finally got to see the boy beneath the horndog.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f1dc2800bc01b2b01f6b53b9cbd815c/tumblr_inline_psyj1i7vaP1wz88wg_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Kanye West aussi est\nbipolaire.</b></p><p>I mean&hellip; </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c8ca563f2e70ace29fe62e4d61c3a3a/tumblr_inline_psyj1pJLv01wz88wg_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c68d9768ed962e56cf5095066544d0a2/tumblr_inline_psyj1yxtsD1wz88wg_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Expressive\nmuch?

Eliott on one side Lucas on the other. The space between them hurt to look at but Eliott didn&rsquo;t dare move any closer. Lucas sat curled tightly into himself like the air brushing his skin hurt. Eliotts fingers twitched wanting to run his fingered through Lucas hair or hold his hand anything to comfort the boy. </p><p>Eliott took a deep breath. </p><p>\u201cLucas i-\u201c </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWait wait, can I say something first.\u201d Lucas interrupted, his eyes closed. </p><p>\u201cYeah yes of course\u201d Eliott nodded silently praying this won\u2019t be Lucas telling him this is the end. That This is their end. Tha-</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Eliott blinked taken aback. </p><p>\u201cI know it must not have been easy to be around me these past few weeks. I know I\u2019ve been distant and I know I\u2019ve been kind of horrible to be around.\u201d Eliott bit back a denial not wanting to interrupt him.</p><p>Lucas sat his hands in his lap playing with the loose string on the hem of his shirt. Eliott&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I haven&rsquo;t been handling everything very well and I took it out on you. I\u2019m having a harder time adjusting to these advanced classes then I thought I would and I\u2019m not even sure if I like science anymore which made me freak out about my future. I was always on uneven ground growing up and I thought I finally had my life figured out but now I\u2019m not so sure and it scared me. Then everything with my dad and mom just&hellip;just set me over the edge.\u201d He rushed it all out in one breath quieting in shame at the end. </p><p>\u201cWhen I came home and it was a mess it made me feel like my life was a mess too, that I had nothing under control which is why I got so upset. But I didn&rsquo;t</p><p> mean to lash out and be so horrible to you. Never you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas dam was starting to break. His voice becoming higher and more frantic with each labored breath he took.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend Eliott, you&rsquo;re my favorite person in the entire world and I love you so much. The best thing that ever happened to me is when you came into my life and I never wanted to do anything to mess that up but I did, I ruined it and I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Lucas sobbed.</p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t resist anymore he jumped over to lucas side of the couch and pulled Lucas face in his hands. </p><p>\u201cHey hey Lucas, shhh it\u2019s okay.\u201d Eliott pulled him to his chest breathing as slowly as he could. </p><p>Lucas was hesitant at first but eventually clung to Eliott\u2019s chest and sobbed into his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Lucas, just breath baby. You\u2019re okay. We\u2019re okay.\u201d Eliott rocked them gently murmuring sweet things into Lucas hair placing a Kiss on his forehead. </p><p>\u201cYou could never ruin us Lucas ever.\u201d</p><p>Eliott Whispered strongly, a few stray tears falling onto Lucas head as he carded through his hair comfortingly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here forever Lucas, I\u2019m not going anywhere I promise. I\u2019m so sorry I made you feel that way.\u201d Eliott said, his voice getting thicker, emotions flooding out. </p><p>Lucas knew eliott was starting to cry even with his face tucked into the taller boys neck and wrapped his arms around his waist giving him a loving squeeze. Even when Lucas is so broken down he is still worrying about Eliott and trying to comfort him forgetting about himself to make sure Eliott was okay.</p><p>\u201cYou do so much for me. You love me even when you\u2019ve seen me at my absolute worst, you make me feel so safe and happier than I\u2019ve ever been. You listen and see me and understand me even when I don\u2019t understand myself. You make me the best Eliott in any universe and I still don&rsquo;t deserve you\u201d</p><p>Lucas breath had calmed down but Eliott was still rocking them. Maybe to soothe himself more than to comfort his boyfriend at this point. Lucas was rubbing circles across Eliott\u2019s back calming him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I keep hurting you.\u201d Eliott whispered </p><p>\u201cI never want to hurt you or scare you or make you think I feel anything but absolute love for you.\u201d </p><p>Eliott placed his firm warm hands on either side of Lucas cheeks needing him too look Eliott in the eye to understand exactly how he felt. </p><p>\u201cYou are the most important thing in my life Lucas. If everything else in the world is wrong as long as you&rsquo;re okay and you\u2019re with me nothing else matters.\u201d </p><p>The rough pad of Elliott&rsquo;s thumb stroked \u00a0across Lucas flushed cheeks. </p><p> \u201cI love you so so much. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d Eliott said his voice steady with absolutely no room for argument. </p><p>Lucas lips pulled up in a small smile his eyes clearing and sparkling blue again as they always should be, filled to the brim with love. The pain and sadness that they held mere minutes ago all but a distant memory. </p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d </p><p>Eliott wrapped Lucas in the tightest hug he has ever given and Lucas did the same. The two crying boys sat in the silent apartment wrapped in their own world together. Eliott slowly pulled away and just looked at Lucas. </p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d Lucas giggled but nodded</p><p>\u201cYou don&rsquo;t have to ask.\u201d </p><p>Eliott pulled Lucas towards him the two melted together into a sweet kiss. </p><p>They stayed there for a moment with no further intentions, no pressure to move any further than this. Just comfort and love.</p><p>The pulled away after a few moments with a sigh. Eliott proceeded to pepper kisses all over Lucas face making the younger boy giggle. Lucas gave him a smile his eyes sparkling with the remaining tears. Eliott sighed closing his eyes and resting their foreheads together.</p><p>They sat there for a moment breathing each other in. The traffic faded away in the background, the evening turning sharply into night. The world quieted around them as the streetlights shone through the curtains painting the room a warm yellow.</p><p>Eliott didn&rsquo;t want to break the peace but something was itching in the back of his head. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened with your parents?\u201d Eliott whispered. Afraid of spooking the boy. </p><p>Lucas looked down with a sigh. He was quiet for a few minutes Eliott thought he had forgotten his question and opened his lips to ask again.. </p><p>\u201cMy mom. She had an episode. It was&hellip; pretty bad this time.\u201d Lucas finally answered in a small voice. </p><p>He pulled away looking Lucas in the eye. He took the smaller boys hands in his own giving them a small squeeze in support. </p><p>\u201cMy dad went to visit her a few weeks ago and brought Josephine, the woman I told you about? Well turns out they are um getting married and my dad thought the best way to tell my mom was to take his shiny new fiance to the clinic he threw her in.\u201d</p><p>Anger flooded Lucas face as it often did when talking about his father. Eliott pulled him closer wrapping an arm around his shoulder urging him to continue. </p><p>\u201cThis episode, it wasn\u2019t the worst but it lasted so long this time I was afraid I would never get her back.\u201d Lucas wiped a tear off his cheek shifting farthing into Eliott\u2019s embrace. </p><p>\u201cHer case worker Kathryn has been keeping me updated but it\u2019s been a few days since I\u2019ve heard anything so I don&rsquo;t know.\u201d </p><p>Eliott was shocked Lucas had kept all of this to himself for so long. He knew Lucas had been struggling but he had no idea it was about something this severe. </p><p>\u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d Eliott asked tentatively. \u00a0</p><p>Lucas nodded his head he pulled his phone out of his back pocket opened it to their thread of messages and it and handed it to Eliott. </p><p>He scrolled through the messages week\u2019s and week\u2019s of Lucas trying to reach out but only being sent verses about judgment and sin and return from his mother. </p><p>Lucas was sniffling. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called a hundred times I want to talk to her and help her as best I can but I can only do so much when she\u2019s like this. I just felt worthless\u201d</p><p>Eliott recalls Lucas being on his phone more often than usual but he figured it had been something to do with Yann or one of the girls. </p><p>He scrolled to the last two weeks of messages.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1206\" data-orig-width=\"1012\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec8137d7e01bc9cf4fb6b688046c7786/tumblr_inline_psyh47g1Ic1rr0qs8_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1206\" data-orig-width=\"1012\"/></figure><p></p><p>\tEliott felt horrible. How could he not see this? Lucas mother was his family. She and Lucas had been suffering for weeks and he just didn&rsquo;t know ? What kind of a boyfriend was he. </p><p>He silently handed the phone back to Lucas and tightened his hand around the boys shoulders to reassure himself that Lucas was really there. </p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d He breathed out part of him too scared of the answer to voice the question out loudly. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know I-\u201c Lucas looked up collecting his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to burden you with it I guess?\u201d He spoke quietly. Eliott was Hurt.</p><p>\u201cBurden m-, Lucas? She is your mother, she is my family too, what happens to her and what\u2019s going on in her life is important to me, it&rsquo;s never a burden.\u201d Eliott said shaking his head in disbelief. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know. I really do know that it&rsquo;s just\u2026 when this kind of thing happens it\u00a0 reminds me of everything we have been through and I hate having to remember my life that way. She has been so good for so long before my dad screwed it up just like he screwed up our lives before and it makes me remember&hellip; how broken my family really is. I just don&rsquo;t like remembering that that was my life.\u201d Lucas finished quietly </p><p>Elliot&rsquo;s face softened He pulled the boy into his arms </p><p>\u201cYour family is not broken Lucas. Yes, your dad did horrible things and I Wish I could take those memories so you don&rsquo;t have to live with them I really do. But, you have your mom who loves you, and Yann and Arthur and Basile and the girls and me. You will always have me. And <i>we</i> are not broken okay?\u201d Eliott said firmly. </p><p>Lucas nodded. Eliott has never said something with so much conviction before, with no room for negotiation Lucas had not choice but to believe him. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>They sat together for a while longer holding each other, Elliott laying on his back With Lucas pulled flush against his chest, talking about everything and nothing. Plans for a trip south in the summer, what to do for Arthur\u2019s birthday, maybe painting their bedroom blue, a new recipe that Elliott found which will surely end in disaster. Just talking to talk.</p><p>After a while they both fell silent just wrapped up in each other enjoying the quiet moment. </p><p>\u201cI feel gross\u201d Lucas said loudly wiping his nose on the back of his sleeve. </p><p>Well so much for that quiet moment. </p><p>Eliottt burst out laughing his chest vibrating underneath Lucas with every chuckle. He looked up fondly at the boy, his eyes sparkling, his cheeks blotchy, and pink his hair sticking up in every direction his nose rubbed raw on his sleeve. He was beautiful. </p><p>He rolled them over so Luca was on his side on the couch then stood up holding his hand out for the boy </p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He smiled down at him</p><p>Lucas raised his eyebrows but took Eliott\u2019s had nonetheless and followed him. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Eliott led them to the bathroom. Lucas was so tired from his roller coaster of a day he just sat down on the toilet lid while Eliott turned the shower on. The hot water warmed the room almost instantly and the steam cleared his nose and soothed his raw throat relaxing his aching muscles. He closed his eyes for a second while his boyfriend went to get them clothes to change into. He felt Eliott fingers thread through his hair pushing it away from his face and kissing his forehead, he opened his eyes and everything was ready for them.</p><p> \u201cShowers ready babe, are you too tired?\u201d Eliott asked his, still running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cNo no I\u2019m good just give me a second\u201d Lucas said rubbing his sleepy eyes trying to wake up enough to take a much needed shower. </p><p>Eliott stood in front of him and started to undress himself, throwing his shirt into the hamper and kicking of his jeans and boxers. </p><p>Lucas eyes were only half way open and his head was resting back against the wall but still let out a little wolf whistle to his boyfriend. </p><p>Eliott chuckled shaking his head at his sleepy boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to help you get undressed.\u201d Eliott asked both walking to stand right in front of Lucas with both hands on his shoulders squeezing them lightly. </p><p>Lucas let out a little pfft. </p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s ever been a question\u201d he giggled </p><p>He held out his hands and Eliott pulled him up to a standing position. Lucas lifted his arms and attempted to pull his shirt over his head. It got stuck on his shoulders and he really didn&rsquo;t have the energy to care. </p><p>\u201cA little help please\u201d he chuckled, his voice muffled but the cotton all wrapped around his head </p><p>Eliott laughed at the sight of his boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cWhat am I gonna do with you?\u201d He said, shaking his head. </p><p>Eliott helped him pull his shirt over his head and then helped him get his pants and boxers off. </p><p>When they were both finally undressed Eliott walked a tried Lucas into the shower. </p><p>He closed the door behind him and pulled the shorter boy to his chest. </p><p>Lucas was already close to passing out but now with the hot water pounding the knots out of his shoulders and Eliott&rsquo;s scent surround him as he pressed his face further into the taller boys neck he was really having a hard time staying awake. </p><p>Eliott reached over and grabbed their coconut scented body was squeezing a heaping dollop on a wash cloth and rubbed it across Lucas back soothingly working the strain out of his muscles and cleaning the grime of the day off of him. He leaned him away to rub his chest and shoulders until he was squeaky clean. Eliott spent longer then he probably needed to washing Lucas but he wanted his boy to feel good and cared for and loved. </p><p>Eliott took their sweet smelling shampoo bottle in his hands intending on washing Lucas hair but Lucas grappled his wrist. </p><p>\u201cWait! I wanna do yours first.\u201d Lucas said quietly </p><p>Eliott chuckled but handed the bottle to Lucas nodding. </p><p>Lucas took some of the shampoo into his hands and reached up on his tiptoes to scrub Eliott\u2019s hair. He was struggling a bit with his balance which was much funnier to the taller boy then it probably should have been. He was stifling laughs while Lucas did a little jig failing to stay still on his toes. </p><p>Lucas Huffed and smiled</p><p> \u201cYou know you could actually help me instead of laughing like a jackass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u201d Eliott said still laughing but leant down resting his head on Lucas shoulder so the shorter boy wouldn\u2019t have to reach so far up to him. </p><p>Lucas shook his head laughing </p><p>\u201cAsshole\u201d He said fondly. </p><p>Lucas combed the shampoo through Elliot&rsquo;s hair. His nails massaging his scalp working the product into his hair and skin. The sweet smell wafting in the room mixing with the steam till it surrounded them.</p><p>After scrubbing his hair a lot longer then he definitely needed he pulled Eliotts head up from his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cThere, squeaky clean.\u201d He said with a smile.</p><p>Eliott smiled back at him turning around quickly to rinse out the shampoo before squeezing some onto his own palm. </p><p>\u201cMy turn\u201d</p><p>Lucas walked stood in front of him while Eliott scrubbed his hair. He massages his scalp and his temples then reached around to rub the back of his neck. </p><p>Lucas was so relaxed he closed his eyes and let out a little sigh. He held onto Eliotts waist for balance rubbing his hands slowly up and down his sides. </p><p>The repetitive motion luled them both into a trance. Lucas still had his eyes closed, feeling almost numb he was so relaxed. </p><p>Eliott kissed his forehead, bringing him back to life. </p><p>\u201cCome one, lets go to bed.\u201d Eliott smiled down at him. </p><p>They stepped out of the shower drying themselves off pulled on some clean T-shirt\u2019s and boxers then made their way to their bedroom. </p><p>Lucas climbed into the bed instantly sinking deep into the cold clean sheets and pulled their comforter up to his chin. Eliott walked over and opened the curtains before turning the light off. His boyfriend never could sleep in a completely dark room. </p><p>Eliott finally climbed into and instantly pulled Lucas tight into his arms. The shorter boys head was tucked safely under Eliotts chin and his ear was resting right above his heart.The steady thrumming of Eliotts heart comforting Lucas and sending him to the brink of sleep. </p><p>But sleep didn\u2019t come for Lucas. </p><p>He laid there thinking about the good moments he and Eliott had, all the hugs, the talks, the kisses. But all those memories were being overshadowed by one big ugly one that sat in front of his mind. The only thing he saw when he closed his eyes. </p><p>Eliott felt Lucas stiffen up more and more as they laid together. He rubbed his warm hands across Lucas back trying to soothe whatever was going on in his mind. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Eliott whispered to Lucas. </p><p>Lucas took a minute to respond not sure if it he should tell Eliott what was going through his head but they had been so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0honest with each other today he didn&rsquo;t want to break that. </p><p>\u201cYou\u201d he finally Settled on. It wasn\u2019t untrue but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth and Eliott knew that. </p><p>He nodded and \u00a0tightened his grip on Lucas waist. </p><p>Lucas was quiet after that and Eliott thought he had finally fallen asleep when Lucas spoke again quietly almost a whisper, like he didn\u2019t actually want Eliott to hear him say it. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026. I can&rsquo;t watch you do that again Eliott.\u201d Lucas said his voice cracking and it broke Eliott&rsquo;s heart all over again.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded pulling him back to his chest trying to protect him from the world. </p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger\u201d Lucas started then paused breathing for a moment </p><p> \u201cWhen my parents were really starting to break apart, I watched my dad walk out on us over and over again. Every time he walked out that door I never knew if it was the last time I would ever see him until finally\u2026 it was.\u201d </p><p>Eliott tightened his arms around Lucas. His arms a barricade between Lucas and the world outside their bedroom. </p><p>\u201cI need you to do something for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnything\u201d Eliott replied instantly Rubbing his hands across Lucas back and through his hair. </p><p>\u201cIf you need space or, if we argue and you need some time away from me.. please, just please don\u2019t walk out the door. Tell me you need to be alone and ill leave the minute you need it. I will leave you alone for as long as you need I promise just don&rsquo;t walk out on me because\u2026\u201d Lucas paused tears falling faster down his cheeks</p><p> \u201cI know I&rsquo;ll always come back to you. But you might not always come back to me.\u201d Lucas was quiet expect the soft tears falling from his eyes. </p><p>Eliott pulled him away with a hand on either side of his face. Eliott was heartbroken that Lucas felt this way. </p><p>\u201cLucas\u2026 I\u201d Eliott started but Lucas cut him off before his thought was even out. </p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s irrational. I know in my heart you love me and don\u2019t want to leave me. I don\u2019t doubt that even for a second when I\u2019m good but\u2026 in the bad times when my head and my heart aren\u2019t on the same page I just\u2026 I need you to do this for me. To make me feel safe. Please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded. He had a soft expression on his face as he cupped Lucas face and wiped the tears spilling out of his eyes. He had cried so much today it\u2019s amazing there\u2019s any tears left. </p><p>Lucas smiled up at him and smiled, nodding.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d </p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything for a while after that \u00a0they just looked at each other. Lying nose to nose breathing each other and the moment. \u00a0Eliott moved slowly and placed a kiss on Lucas forehead so gentle it almost hurt then another on his cheek before finally pressing their lips together. Eliott kissed Lucas soft but deeply into him trying to engrain Lucas with his love forever. </p><p>They pulled apart and looked at each other again. Lucas tilted his head up and pressed a little kiss to the tip of Eliotts nose. </p><p>Eliott smiled and pulled Lucas to him crushing him against his chest wrapping his arms around his shoulders and burying his face in his soft hair. \u00a0</p><p>Lucas wrapped his arms tightly around waist holding him close. </p><p>\u201c I love you\u201d Eliott said quietly, his lips pressing to words into Lucas skin, his voice muffled by their closeness.</p><p>\u201cSo so much\u201d</p><p>Lucas squeezed his eyes closed entwined their legs and wrapped his arms impossibly tight around Eliotts waist.</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d He said. </p><p>\u201cSo so much\u201d</p><p>The End.</p><p>================================================</p><p>That\u2019s all Folks!

I was always on uneven ground growing up and I thought I finally had my life figured out but now I\u2019m not so sure and it scared me. Then everything with my dad and mom just\u2026just set me over the edge.\u201d He rushed it all out in one breath quieting in shame at the end. </p><p>\u201cWhen I came home and it was a mess it made me feel like my life was a mess too, that I had nothing under control which is why I got so upset. But I didn\u2019t</p><p> mean to lash out and be so horrible to you. Never you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas dam was starting to break. His voice becoming higher and more frantic with each labored breath he took.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend Eliott, you\u2019re my favorite person in the entire world and I love you so much. The best thing that ever happened to me is when you came into my life and I never wanted to do anything to mess that up but I did, I ruined it and I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Lucas sobbed.</p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t resist anymore he jumped over to lucas side of the couch and pulled Lucas face in his hands. </p><p>\u201cHey hey Lucas, shhh it\u2019s okay.\u201d Eliott pulled him to his chest breathing as slowly as he could. </p><p>Lucas was hesitant at first but eventually clung to Eliott\u2019s chest and sobbed into his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Lucas, just breath baby. You\u2019re okay. We\u2019re okay.\u201d Eliott rocked them gently murmuring sweet things into Lucas hair placing a Kiss on his forehead. </p><p>\u201cYou could never ruin us Lucas ever.\u201d</p><p>Eliott Whispered strongly, a few stray tears falling onto Lucas head as he carded through his hair comfortingly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here forever Lucas, I\u2019m not going anywhere I promise. I\u2019m so sorry I made you feel that way.\u201d Eliott said, his voice getting thicker, emotions flooding out. </p><p>Lucas knew eliott was starting to cry even with his face tucked into the taller boys neck and wrapped his arms around his waist giving him a loving squeeze. Even when Lucas is so broken down he is still worrying about Eliott and trying to comfort him forgetting about himself to make sure Eliott was okay.</p><p>\u201cYou do so much for me. You love me even when you\u2019ve seen me at my absolute worst, you make me feel so safe and happier than I\u2019ve ever been. You listen and see me and understand me even when I don\u2019t understand myself. You make me the best Eliott in any universe and I still don\u2019t deserve you\u201d</p><p>Lucas breath had calmed down but Eliott was still rocking them. Maybe to soothe himself more than to comfort his boyfriend at this point. Lucas was rubbing circles across Eliott\u2019s back calming him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I keep hurting you.\u201d Eliott whispered </p><p>\u201cI never want to hurt you or scare you or make you think I feel anything but absolute love for you.\u201d </p><p>Eliott placed his firm warm hands on either side of Lucas cheeks needing him too look Eliott in the eye to understand exactly how he felt. </p><p>\u201cYou are the most important thing in my life Lucas. If everything else in the world is wrong as long as you\u2019re okay and you\u2019re with me nothing else matters.\u201d </p><p>The rough pad of Elliott\u2019s thumb stroked \u00a0across Lucas flushed cheeks. </p><p> \u201cI love you so so much. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d Eliott said his voice steady with absolutely no room for argument. </p><p>Lucas lips pulled up in a small smile his eyes clearing and sparkling blue again as they always should be, filled to the brim with love. The pain and sadness that they held mere minutes ago all but a distant memory. </p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d </p><p>Eliott wrapped Lucas in the tightest hug he has ever given and Lucas did the same. The two crying boys sat in the silent apartment wrapped in their own world together. Eliott slowly pulled away and just looked at Lucas. </p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d Lucas giggled but nodded</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d </p><p>Eliott pulled Lucas towards him the two melted together into a sweet kiss. </p><p>They stayed there for a moment with no further intentions, no pressure to move any further than this. Just comfort and love.</p><p>The pulled away after a few moments with a sigh. Eliott proceeded to pepper kisses all over Lucas face making the younger boy giggle. Lucas gave him a smile his eyes sparkling with the remaining tears. Eliott sighed closing his eyes and resting their foreheads together.</p><p>They sat there for a moment breathing each other in. The traffic faded away in the background, the evening turning sharply into night. The world quieted around them as the streetlights shone through the curtains painting the room a warm yellow.</p><p>Eliott didn\u2019t want to break the peace but something was itching in the back of his head. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened with your parents?\u201d Eliott whispered. Afraid of spooking the boy. </p><p>Lucas looked down with a sigh. He was quiet for a few minutes Eliott thought he had forgotten his question and opened his lips to ask again.. </p><p>\u201cMy mom. She had an episode. It was\u2026 pretty bad this time.\u201d Lucas finally answered in a small voice. </p><p>He pulled away looking Lucas in the eye. He took the smaller boys hands in his own giving them a small squeeze in support. </p><p>\u201cMy dad went to visit her a few weeks ago and brought Josephine, the woman I told you about? Well turns out they are um getting married and my dad thought the best way to tell my mom was to take his shiny new fiance to the clinic he threw her in.\u201d</p><p>Anger flooded Lucas face as it often did when talking about his father. Eliott pulled him closer wrapping an arm around his shoulder urging him to continue. </p><p>\u201cThis episode, it wasn\u2019t the worst but it lasted so long this time I was afraid I would never get her back.\u201d Lucas wiped a tear off his cheek shifting farthing into Eliott\u2019s embrace. </p><p>\u201cHer case worker Kathryn has been keeping me updated but it\u2019s been a few days since I\u2019ve heard anything so I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>Eliott was shocked Lucas had kept all of this to himself for so long. He knew Lucas had been struggling but he had no idea it was about something this severe. </p><p>\u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d Eliott asked tentatively. \u00a0</p><p>Lucas nodded his head he pulled his phone out of his back pocket opened it to their thread of messages and it and handed it to Eliott. </p><p>He scrolled through the messages week\u2019s and week\u2019s of Lucas trying to reach out but only being sent verses about judgment and sin and return from his mother. </p><p>Lucas was sniffling. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called a hundred times I want to talk to her and help her as best I can but I can only do so much when she\u2019s like this. I just felt worthless\u201d</p><p>Eliott recalls Lucas being on his phone more often than usual but he figured it had been something to do with Yann or one of the girls. </p><p>He scrolled to the last two weeks of messages.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1206\" data-orig-width=\"1012\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec8137d7e01bc9cf4fb6b688046c7786/tumblr_inline_psyh47g1Ic1rr0qs8_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1206\" data-orig-width=\"1012\"></figure><p></p><p>\tEliott felt horrible. How could he not see this? Lucas mother was his family. She and Lucas had been suffering for weeks and he just didn\u2019t know ? What kind of a boyfriend was he. </p><p>He silently handed the phone back to Lucas and tightened his hand around the boys shoulders to reassure himself that Lucas was really there. </p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d He breathed out part of him too scared of the answer to voice the question out loudly. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know I-\u201c Lucas looked up collecting his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to burden you with it I guess?\u201d He spoke quietly. Eliott was Hurt.</p><p>\u201cBurden m-, Lucas? She is your mother, she is my family too, what happens to her and what\u2019s going on in her life is important to me, it\u2019s never a burden.\u201d Eliott said shaking his head in disbelief. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know. I really do know that it\u2019s just\u2026 when this kind of thing happens it\u00a0 reminds me of everything we have been through and I hate having to remember my life that way. She has been so good for so long before my dad screwed it up just like he screwed up our lives before and it makes me remember\u2026 how broken my family really is. I just don\u2019t like remembering that that was my life.\u201d Lucas finished quietly </p><p>Elliot\u2019s face softened He pulled the boy into his arms </p><p>\u201cYour family is not broken Lucas. Yes, your dad did horrible things and I Wish I could take those memories so you don\u2019t have to live with them I really do. But, you have your mom who loves you, and Yann and Arthur and Basile and the girls and me. You will always have me. And <i>we</i> are not broken okay?\u201d Eliott said firmly. </p><p>Lucas nodded. Eliott has never said something with so much conviction before, with no room for negotiation Lucas had not choice but to believe him. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>They sat together for a while longer holding each other, Elliott laying on his back With Lucas pulled flush against his chest, talking about everything and nothing. Plans for a trip south in the summer, what to do for Arthur\u2019s birthday, maybe painting their bedroom blue, a new recipe that Elliott found which will surely end in disaster. Just talking to talk.</p><p>After a while they both fell silent just wrapped up in each other enjoying the quiet moment. </p><p>\u201cI feel gross\u201d Lucas said loudly wiping his nose on the back of his sleeve. </p><p>Well so much for that quiet moment. </p><p>Eliottt burst out laughing his chest vibrating underneath Lucas with every chuckle. He looked up fondly at the boy, his eyes sparkling, his cheeks blotchy, and pink his hair sticking up in every direction his nose rubbed raw on his sleeve. He was beautiful. </p><p>He rolled them over so Luca was on his side on the couch then stood up holding his hand out for the boy </p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He smiled down at him</p><p>Lucas raised his eyebrows but took Eliott\u2019s had nonetheless and followed him. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Eliott led them to the bathroom. Lucas was so tired from his roller coaster of a day he just sat down on the toilet lid while Eliott turned the shower on. The hot water warmed the room almost instantly and the steam cleared his nose and soothed his raw throat relaxing his aching muscles. He closed his eyes for a second while his boyfriend went to get them clothes to change into. He felt Eliott fingers thread through his hair pushing it away from his face and kissing his forehead, he opened his eyes and everything was ready for them.</p><p> \u201cShowers ready babe, are you too tired?\u201d Eliott asked his, still running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cNo no I\u2019m good just give me a second\u201d Lucas said rubbing his sleepy eyes trying to wake up enough to take a much needed shower. </p><p>Eliott stood in front of him and started to undress himself, throwing his shirt into the hamper and kicking of his jeans and boxers. </p><p>Lucas eyes were only half way open and his head was resting back against the wall but still let out a little wolf whistle to his boyfriend. </p><p>Eliott chuckled shaking his head at his sleepy boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to help you get undressed.\u201d Eliott asked both walking to stand right in front of Lucas with both hands on his shoulders squeezing them lightly. </p><p>Lucas let out a little pfft. </p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s ever been a question\u201d he giggled </p><p>He held out his hands and Eliott pulled him up to a standing position. Lucas lifted his arms and attempted to pull his shirt over his head. It got stuck on his shoulders and he really didn\u2019t have the energy to care. </p><p>\u201cA little help please\u201d he chuckled, his voice muffled but the cotton all wrapped around his head </p><p>Eliott laughed at the sight of his boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cWhat am I gonna do with you?\u201d He said, shaking his head. </p><p>Eliott helped him pull his shirt over his head and then helped him get his pants and boxers off. </p><p>When they were both finally undressed Eliott walked a tried Lucas into the shower. </p><p>He closed the door behind him and pulled the shorter boy to his chest. </p><p>Lucas was already close to passing out but now with the hot water pounding the knots out of his shoulders and Eliott\u2019s scent surround him as he pressed his face further into the taller boys neck he was really having a hard time staying awake. </p><p>Eliott reached over and grabbed their coconut scented body was squeezing a heaping dollop on a wash cloth and rubbed it across Lucas back soothingly working the strain out of his muscles and cleaning the grime of the day off of him. He leaned him away to rub his chest and shoulders until he was squeaky clean. Eliott spent longer then he probably needed to washing Lucas but he wanted his boy to feel good and cared for and loved. </p><p>Eliott took their sweet smelling shampoo bottle in his hands intending on washing Lucas hair but Lucas grappled his wrist. </p><p>\u201cWait! I wanna do yours first.\u201d Lucas said quietly </p><p>Eliott chuckled but handed the bottle to Lucas nodding. </p><p>Lucas took some of the shampoo into his hands and reached up on his tiptoes to scrub Eliott\u2019s hair. He was struggling a bit with his balance which was much funnier to the taller boy then it probably should have been. He was stifling laughs while Lucas did a little jig failing to stay still on his toes. </p><p>Lucas Huffed and smiled</p><p> \u201cYou know you could actually help me instead of laughing like a jackass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u201d Eliott said still laughing but leant down resting his head on Lucas shoulder so the shorter boy wouldn\u2019t have to reach so far up to him. </p><p>Lucas shook his head laughing </p><p>\u201cAsshole\u201d He said fondly. </p><p>Lucas combed the shampoo through Elliot\u2019s hair. His nails massaging his scalp working the product into his hair and skin. The sweet smell wafting in the room mixing with the steam till it surrounded them.</p><p>After scrubbing his hair a lot longer then he definitely needed he pulled Eliotts head up from his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cThere, squeaky clean.\u201d He said with a smile.</p><p>Eliott smiled back at him turning around quickly to rinse out the shampoo before squeezing some onto his own palm. </p><p>\u201cMy turn\u201d</p><p>Lucas walked stood in front of him while Eliott scrubbed his hair. He massages his scalp and his temples then reached around to rub the back of his neck. </p><p>Lucas was so relaxed he closed his eyes and let out a little sigh. He held onto Eliotts waist for balance rubbing his hands slowly up and down his sides. </p><p>The repetitive motion luled them both into a trance. Lucas still had his eyes closed, feeling almost numb he was so relaxed. </p><p>Eliott kissed his forehead, bringing him back to life. </p><p>\u201cCome one, lets go to bed.\u201d Eliott smiled down at him. </p><p>They stepped out of the shower drying themselves off pulled on some clean T-shirt\u2019s and boxers then made their way to their bedroom. </p><p>Lucas climbed into the bed instantly sinking deep into the cold clean sheets and pulled their comforter up to his chin. Eliott walked over and opened the curtains before turning the light off. His boyfriend never could sleep in a completely dark room. </p><p>Eliott finally climbed into and instantly pulled Lucas tight into his arms. The shorter boys head was tucked safely under Eliotts chin and his ear was resting right above his heart.The steady thrumming of Eliotts heart comforting Lucas and sending him to the brink of sleep. </p><p>But sleep didn\u2019t come for Lucas. </p><p>He laid there thinking about the good moments he and Eliott had, all the hugs, the talks, the kisses. But all those memories were being overshadowed by one big ugly one that sat in front of his mind. The only thing he saw when he closed his eyes. </p><p>Eliott felt Lucas stiffen up more and more as they laid together. He rubbed his warm hands across Lucas back trying to soothe whatever was going on in his mind. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Eliott whispered to Lucas. </p><p>Lucas took a minute to respond not sure if it he should tell Eliott what was going through his head but they had been so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0honest with each other today he didn\u2019t want to break that. </p><p>\u201cYou\u201d he finally Settled on. It wasn\u2019t untrue but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth and Eliott knew that. </p><p>He nodded and \u00a0tightened his grip on Lucas waist. </p><p>Lucas was quiet after that and Eliott thought he had finally fallen asleep when Lucas spoke again quietly almost a whisper, like he didn\u2019t actually want Eliott to hear him say it. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026. I can\u2019t watch you do that again Eliott.\u201d Lucas said his voice cracking and it broke Eliott\u2019s heart all over again.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded pulling him back to his chest trying to protect him from the world. </p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger\u201d Lucas started then paused breathing for a moment </p><p> \u201cWhen my parents were really starting to break apart, I watched my dad walk out on us over and over again. Every time he walked out that door I never knew if it was the last time I would ever see him until finally\u2026 it was.\u201d </p><p>Eliott tightened his arms around Lucas. His arms a barricade between Lucas and the world outside their bedroom. </p><p>\u201cI need you to do something for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnything\u201d Eliott replied instantly Rubbing his hands across Lucas back and through his hair. </p><p>\u201cIf you need space or, if we argue and you need some time away from me.. please, just please don\u2019t walk out the door. Tell me you need to be alone and ill leave the minute you need it. I will leave you alone for as long as you need I promise just don\u2019t walk out on me because\u2026\u201d Lucas paused tears falling faster down his cheeks</p><p> \u201cI know I\u2019ll always come back to you. But you might not always come back to me.\u201d Lucas was quiet expect the soft tears falling from his eyes. </p><p>Eliott pulled him away with a hand on either side of his face. Eliott was heartbroken that Lucas felt this way. </p><p>\u201cLucas\u2026 I\u201d Eliott started but Lucas cut him off before his thought was even out. </p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s irrational. I know in my heart you love me and don\u2019t want to leave me. I don\u2019t doubt that even for a second when I\u2019m good but\u2026 in the bad times when my head and my heart aren\u2019t on the same page I just\u2026 I need you to do this for me. To make me feel safe. Please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded. He had a soft expression on his face as he cupped Lucas face and wiped the tears spilling out of his eyes. He had cried so much today it\u2019s amazing there\u2019s any tears left. </p><p>Lucas smiled up at him and smiled, nodding.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d </p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything for a while after that \u00a0they just looked at each other. Lying nose to nose breathing each other and the moment. \u00a0Eliott moved slowly and placed a kiss on Lucas forehead so gentle it almost hurt then another on his cheek before finally pressing their lips together. Eliott kissed Lucas soft but deeply into him trying to engrain Lucas with his love forever. </p><p>They pulled apart and looked at each other again. Lucas tilted his head up and pressed a little kiss to the tip of Eliotts nose. </p><p>Eliott smiled and pulled Lucas to him crushing him against his chest wrapping his arms around his shoulders and burying his face in his soft hair. \u00a0</p><p>Lucas wrapped his arms tightly around waist holding him close. </p><p>\u201c I love you\u201d Eliott said quietly, his lips pressing to words into Lucas skin, his voice muffled by their closeness.</p><p>\u201cSo so much\u201d</p><p>Lucas squeezed his eyes closed entwined their legs and wrapped his arms impossibly tight around Eliotts waist.</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d He said. </p><p>\u201cSo so much\u201d</p><p>The End.</p><p>================================================</p><p>That\u2019s all Folks!

Eliott on one side Lucas on the other. The space between them hurt to look at but Eliott didn\u2019t dare move any closer. Lucas sat curled tightly into himself like the air brushing his skin hurt. Eliotts fingers twitched wanting to run his fingered through Lucas hair or hold his hand anything to comfort the boy. </p><p>Eliott took a deep breath. </p><p>\u201cLucas i-\u201c </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWait wait, can I say something first.\u201d Lucas interrupted, his eyes closed. </p><p>\u201cYeah yes of course\u201d Eliott nodded silently praying this won\u2019t be Lucas telling him this is the end. That This is their end. Tha-</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Eliott blinked taken aback. </p><p>\u201cI know it must not have been easy to be around me these past few weeks. I know I\u2019ve been distant and I know I\u2019ve been kind of horrible to be around.\u201d Eliott bit back a denial not wanting to interrupt him.</p><p>Lucas sat his hands in his lap playing with the loose string on the hem of his shirt. Eliott\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I haven\u2019t been handling everything very well and I took it out on you. I\u2019m having a harder time adjusting to these advanced classes then I thought I would and I\u2019m not even sure if I like science anymore which made me freak out about my future. I was always on uneven ground growing up and I thought I finally had my life figured out but now I\u2019m not so sure and it scared me. Then everything with my dad and mom just\u2026just set me over the edge.\u201d He rushed it all out in one breath quieting in shame at the end. </p><p>\u201cWhen I came home and it was a mess it made me feel like my life was a mess too, that I had nothing under control which is why I got so upset. But I didn\u2019t</p><p> mean to lash out and be so horrible to you. Never you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas dam was starting to break. His voice becoming higher and more frantic with each labored breath he took.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend Eliott, you\u2019re my favorite person in the entire world and I love you so much. The best thing that ever happened to me is when you came into my life and I never wanted to do anything to mess that up but I did, I ruined it and I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Lucas sobbed.</p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t resist anymore he jumped over to lucas side of the couch and pulled Lucas face in his hands. </p><p>\u201cHey hey Lucas, shhh it\u2019s okay.\u201d Eliott pulled him to his chest breathing as slowly as he could. </p><p>Lucas was hesitant at first but eventually clung to Eliott\u2019s chest and sobbed into his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Lucas, just breath baby. You\u2019re okay. We\u2019re okay.\u201d Eliott rocked them gently murmuring sweet things into Lucas hair placing a Kiss on his forehead. </p><p>\u201cYou could never ruin us Lucas ever.\u201d</p><p>Eliott Whispered strongly, a few stray tears falling onto Lucas head as he carded through his hair comfortingly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here forever Lucas, I\u2019m not going anywhere I promise. I\u2019m so sorry I made you feel that way.\u201d Eliott said, his voice getting thicker, emotions flooding out. </p><p>Lucas knew eliott was starting to cry even with his face tucked into the taller boys neck and wrapped his arms around his waist giving him a loving squeeze. Even when Lucas is so broken down he is still worrying about Eliott and trying to comfort him forgetting about himself to make sure Eliott was okay.</p><p>\u201cYou do so much for me. You love me even when you\u2019ve seen me at my absolute worst, you make me feel so safe and happier than I\u2019ve ever been. You listen and see me and understand me even when I don\u2019t understand myself. You make me the best Eliott in any universe and I still don\u2019t deserve you\u201d</p><p>Lucas breath had calmed down but Eliott was still rocking them. Maybe to soothe himself more than to comfort his boyfriend at this point. Lucas was rubbing circles across Eliott\u2019s back calming him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I keep hurting you.\u201d Eliott whispered </p><p>\u201cI never want to hurt you or scare you or make you think I feel anything but absolute love for you.\u201d </p><p>Eliott placed his firm warm hands on either side of Lucas cheeks needing him too look Eliott in the eye to understand exactly how he felt. </p><p>\u201cYou are the most important thing in my life Lucas. If everything else in the world is wrong as long as you\u2019re okay and you\u2019re with me nothing else matters.\u201d </p><p>The rough pad of Elliott\u2019s thumb stroked \u00a0across Lucas flushed cheeks. </p><p> \u201cI love you so so much. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d Eliott said his voice steady with absolutely no room for argument. </p><p>Lucas lips pulled up in a small smile his eyes clearing and sparkling blue again as they always should be, filled to the brim with love. The pain and sadness that they held mere minutes ago all but a distant memory. </p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d </p><p>Eliott wrapped Lucas in the tightest hug he has ever given and Lucas did the same. The two crying boys sat in the silent apartment wrapped in their own world together. Eliott slowly pulled away and just looked at Lucas. </p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d Lucas giggled but nodded</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d </p><p>Eliott pulled Lucas towards him the two melted together into a sweet kiss. </p><p>They stayed there for a moment with no further intentions, no pressure to move any further than this. Just comfort and love.</p><p>The pulled away after a few moments with a sigh. Eliott proceeded to pepper kisses all over Lucas face making the younger boy giggle. Lucas gave him a smile his eyes sparkling with the remaining tears. Eliott sighed closing his eyes and resting their foreheads together.</p><p>They sat there for a moment breathing each other in. The traffic faded away in the background, the evening turning sharply into night. The world quieted around them as the streetlights shone through the curtains painting the room a warm yellow.</p><p>Eliott didn\u2019t want to break the peace but something was itching in the back of his head. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened with your parents?\u201d Eliott whispered. Afraid of spooking the boy. </p><p>Lucas looked down with a sigh. He was quiet for a few minutes Eliott thought he had forgotten his question and opened his lips to ask again.. </p><p>\u201cMy mom. She had an episode. It was\u2026 pretty bad this time.\u201d Lucas finally answered in a small voice. </p><p>He pulled away looking Lucas in the eye. He took the smaller boys hands in his own giving them a small squeeze in support. </p><p>\u201cMy dad went to visit her a few weeks ago and brought Josephine, the woman I told you about? Well turns out they are um getting married and my dad thought the best way to tell my mom was to take his shiny new fiance to the clinic he threw her in.\u201d</p><p>Anger flooded Lucas face as it often did when talking about his father. Eliott pulled him closer wrapping an arm around his shoulder urging him to continue. </p><p>\u201cThis episode, it wasn\u2019t the worst but it lasted so long this time I was afraid I would never get her back.\u201d Lucas wiped a tear off his cheek shifting farthing into Eliott\u2019s embrace. </p><p>\u201cHer case worker Kathryn has been keeping me updated but it\u2019s been a few days since I\u2019ve heard anything so I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>Eliott was shocked Lucas had kept all of this to himself for so long. He knew Lucas had been struggling but he had no idea it was about something this severe. </p><p>\u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d Eliott asked tentatively. \u00a0</p><p>Lucas nodded his head he pulled his phone out of his back pocket opened it to their thread of messages and it and handed it to Eliott. </p><p>He scrolled through the messages week\u2019s and week\u2019s of Lucas trying to reach out but only being sent verses about judgment and sin and return from his mother. </p><p>Lucas was sniffling. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called a hundred times I want to talk to her and help her as best I can but I can only do so much when she\u2019s like this. I just felt worthless\u201d</p><p>Eliott recalls Lucas being on his phone more often than usual but he figured it had been something to do with Yann or one of the girls. </p><p>He scrolled to the last two weeks of messages.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1206\" data-orig-width=\"1012\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec8137d7e01bc9cf4fb6b688046c7786/tumblr_inline_psyh47g1Ic1rr0qs8_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1206\" data-orig-width=\"1012\"></figure><p></p><p>\tEliott felt horrible. How could he not see this? Lucas mother was his family. She and Lucas had been suffering for weeks and he just didn\u2019t know ? What kind of a boyfriend was he. </p><p>He silently handed the phone back to Lucas and tightened his hand around the boys shoulders to reassure himself that Lucas was really there. </p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d He breathed out part of him too scared of the answer to voice the question out loudly. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know I-\u201c Lucas looked up collecting his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to burden you with it I guess?\u201d He spoke quietly. Eliott was Hurt.</p><p>\u201cBurden m-, Lucas? She is your mother, she is my family too, what happens to her and what\u2019s going on in her life is important to me, it\u2019s never a burden.\u201d Eliott said shaking his head in disbelief. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know. I really do know that it\u2019s just\u2026 when this kind of thing happens it\u00a0 reminds me of everything we have been through and I hate having to remember my life that way. She has been so good for so long before my dad screwed it up just like he screwed up our lives before and it makes me remember\u2026 how broken my family really is. I just don\u2019t like remembering that that was my life.\u201d Lucas finished quietly </p><p>Elliot\u2019s face softened He pulled the boy into his arms </p><p>\u201cYour family is not broken Lucas. Yes, your dad did horrible things and I Wish I could take those memories so you don\u2019t have to live with them I really do. But, you have your mom who loves you, and Yann and Arthur and Basile and the girls and me. You will always have me. And <i>we</i> are not broken okay?\u201d Eliott said firmly. </p><p>Lucas nodded. Eliott has never said something with so much conviction before, with no room for negotiation Lucas had not choice but to believe him. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>They sat together for a while longer holding each other, Elliott laying on his back With Lucas pulled flush against his chest, talking about everything and nothing. Plans for a trip south in the summer, what to do for Arthur\u2019s birthday, maybe painting their bedroom blue, a new recipe that Elliott found which will surely end in disaster. Just talking to talk.</p><p>After a while they both fell silent just wrapped up in each other enjoying the quiet moment. </p><p>\u201cI feel gross\u201d Lucas said loudly wiping his nose on the back of his sleeve. </p><p>Well so much for that quiet moment. </p><p>Eliottt burst out laughing his chest vibrating underneath Lucas with every chuckle. He looked up fondly at the boy, his eyes sparkling, his cheeks blotchy, and pink his hair sticking up in every direction his nose rubbed raw on his sleeve. He was beautiful. </p><p>He rolled them over so Luca was on his side on the couch then stood up holding his hand out for the boy </p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He smiled down at him</p><p>Lucas raised his eyebrows but took Eliott\u2019s had nonetheless and followed him. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Eliott led them to the bathroom. Lucas was so tired from his roller coaster of a day he just sat down on the toilet lid while Eliott turned the shower on. The hot water warmed the room almost instantly and the steam cleared his nose and soothed his raw throat relaxing his aching muscles. He closed his eyes for a second while his boyfriend went to get them clothes to change into. He felt Eliott fingers thread through his hair pushing it away from his face and kissing his forehead, he opened his eyes and everything was ready for them.</p><p> \u201cShowers ready babe, are you too tired?\u201d Eliott asked his, still running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cNo no I\u2019m good just give me a second\u201d Lucas said rubbing his sleepy eyes trying to wake up enough to take a much needed shower. </p><p>Eliott stood in front of him and started to undress himself, throwing his shirt into the hamper and kicking of his jeans and boxers. </p><p>Lucas eyes were only half way open and his head was resting back against the wall but still let out a little wolf whistle to his boyfriend. </p><p>Eliott chuckled shaking his head at his sleepy boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to help you get undressed.\u201d Eliott asked both walking to stand right in front of Lucas with both hands on his shoulders squeezing them lightly. </p><p>Lucas let out a little pfft. </p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s ever been a question\u201d he giggled </p><p>He held out his hands and Eliott pulled him up to a standing position. Lucas lifted his arms and attempted to pull his shirt over his head. It got stuck on his shoulders and he really didn\u2019t have the energy to care. </p><p>\u201cA little help please\u201d he chuckled, his voice muffled but the cotton all wrapped around his head </p><p>Eliott laughed at the sight of his boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cWhat am I gonna do with you?\u201d He said, shaking his head. </p><p>Eliott helped him pull his shirt over his head and then helped him get his pants and boxers off. </p><p>When they were both finally undressed Eliott walked a tried Lucas into the shower. </p><p>He closed the door behind him and pulled the shorter boy to his chest. </p><p>Lucas was already close to passing out but now with the hot water pounding the knots out of his shoulders and Eliott\u2019s scent surround him as he pressed his face further into the taller boys neck he was really having a hard time staying awake. </p><p>Eliott reached over and grabbed their coconut scented body was squeezing a heaping dollop on a wash cloth and rubbed it across Lucas back soothingly working the strain out of his muscles and cleaning the grime of the day off of him. He leaned him away to rub his chest and shoulders until he was squeaky clean. Eliott spent longer then he probably needed to washing Lucas but he wanted his boy to feel good and cared for and loved. </p><p>Eliott took their sweet smelling shampoo bottle in his hands intending on washing Lucas hair but Lucas grappled his wrist. </p><p>\u201cWait! I wanna do yours first.\u201d Lucas said quietly </p><p>Eliott chuckled but handed the bottle to Lucas nodding. </p><p>Lucas took some of the shampoo into his hands and reached up on his tiptoes to scrub Eliott\u2019s hair. He was struggling a bit with his balance which was much funnier to the taller boy then it probably should have been. He was stifling laughs while Lucas did a little jig failing to stay still on his toes. </p><p>Lucas Huffed and smiled</p><p> \u201cYou know you could actually help me instead of laughing like a jackass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u201d Eliott said still laughing but leant down resting his head on Lucas shoulder so the shorter boy wouldn\u2019t have to reach so far up to him. </p><p>Lucas shook his head laughing </p><p>\u201cAsshole\u201d He said fondly. </p><p>Lucas combed the shampoo through Elliot\u2019s hair. His nails massaging his scalp working the product into his hair and skin. The sweet smell wafting in the room mixing with the steam till it surrounded them.</p><p>After scrubbing his hair a lot longer then he definitely needed he pulled Eliotts head up from his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cThere, squeaky clean.\u201d He said with a smile.</p><p>Eliott smiled back at him turning around quickly to rinse out the shampoo before squeezing some onto his own palm. </p><p>\u201cMy turn\u201d</p><p>Lucas walked stood in front of him while Eliott scrubbed his hair. He massages his scalp and his temples then reached around to rub the back of his neck. </p><p>Lucas was so relaxed he closed his eyes and let out a little sigh. He held onto Eliotts waist for balance rubbing his hands slowly up and down his sides. </p><p>The repetitive motion luled them both into a trance. Lucas still had his eyes closed, feeling almost numb he was so relaxed. </p><p>Eliott kissed his forehead, bringing him back to life. </p><p>\u201cCome one, lets go to bed.\u201d Eliott smiled down at him. </p><p>They stepped out of the shower drying themselves off pulled on some clean T-shirt\u2019s and boxers then made their way to their bedroom. </p><p>Lucas climbed into the bed instantly sinking deep into the cold clean sheets and pulled their comforter up to his chin. Eliott walked over and opened the curtains before turning the light off. His boyfriend never could sleep in a completely dark room. </p><p>Eliott finally climbed into and instantly pulled Lucas tight into his arms. The shorter boys head was tucked safely under Eliotts chin and his ear was resting right above his heart.The steady thrumming of Eliotts heart comforting Lucas and sending him to the brink of sleep. </p><p>But sleep didn\u2019t come for Lucas. </p><p>He laid there thinking about the good moments he and Eliott had, all the hugs, the talks, the kisses. But all those memories were being overshadowed by one big ugly one that sat in front of his mind. The only thing he saw when he closed his eyes. </p><p>Eliott felt Lucas stiffen up more and more as they laid together. He rubbed his warm hands across Lucas back trying to soothe whatever was going on in his mind. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Eliott whispered to Lucas. </p><p>Lucas took a minute to respond not sure if it he should tell Eliott what was going through his head but they had been so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0honest with each other today he didn\u2019t want to break that. </p><p>\u201cYou\u201d he finally Settled on. It wasn\u2019t untrue but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth and Eliott knew that. </p><p>He nodded and \u00a0tightened his grip on Lucas waist. </p><p>Lucas was quiet after that and Eliott thought he had finally fallen asleep when Lucas spoke again quietly almost a whisper, like he didn\u2019t actually want Eliott to hear him say it. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026. I can\u2019t watch you do that again Eliott.\u201d Lucas said his voice cracking and it broke Eliott\u2019s heart all over again.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded pulling him back to his chest trying to protect him from the world. </p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger\u201d Lucas started then paused breathing for a moment </p><p> \u201cWhen my parents were really starting to break apart, I watched my dad walk out on us over and over again. Every time he walked out that door I never knew if it was the last time I would ever see him until finally\u2026 it was.\u201d </p><p>Eliott tightened his arms around Lucas. His arms a barricade between Lucas and the world outside their bedroom. </p><p>\u201cI need you to do something for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnything\u201d Eliott replied instantly Rubbing his hands across Lucas back and through his hair. </p><p>\u201cIf you need space or, if we argue and you need some time away from me.. please, just please don\u2019t walk out the door. Tell me you need to be alone and ill leave the minute you need it. I will leave you alone for as long as you need I promise just don\u2019t walk out on me because\u2026\u201d Lucas paused tears falling faster down his cheeks</p><p> \u201cI know I\u2019ll always come back to you. But you might not always come back to me.\u201d Lucas was quiet expect the soft tears falling from his eyes. </p><p>Eliott pulled him away with a hand on either side of his face. Eliott was heartbroken that Lucas felt this way. </p><p>\u201cLucas\u2026 I\u201d Eliott started but Lucas cut him off before his thought was even out. </p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s irrational. I know in my heart you love me and don\u2019t want to leave me. I don\u2019t doubt that even for a second when I\u2019m good but\u2026 in the bad times when my head and my heart aren\u2019t on the same page I just\u2026 I need you to do this for me. To make me feel safe. Please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d</p><p>Eliott nodded. He had a soft expression on his face as he cupped Lucas face and wiped the tears spilling out of his eyes. He had cried so much today it\u2019s amazing there\u2019s any tears left. </p><p>Lucas smiled up at him and smiled, nodding.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d </p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything for a while after that \u00a0they just looked at each other. Lying nose to nose breathing each other and the moment. \u00a0Eliott moved slowly and placed a kiss on Lucas forehead so gentle it almost hurt then another on his cheek before finally pressing their lips together. Eliott kissed Lucas soft but deeply into him trying to engrain Lucas with his love forever. </p><p>They pulled apart and looked at each other again. Lucas tilted his head up and pressed a little kiss to the tip of Eliotts nose. </p><p>Eliott smiled and pulled Lucas to him crushing him against his chest wrapping his arms around his shoulders and burying his face in his soft hair. \u00a0</p><p>Lucas wrapped his arms tightly around waist holding him close. </p><p>\u201c I love you\u201d Eliott said quietly, his lips pressing to words into Lucas skin, his voice muffled by their closeness.</p><p>\u201cSo so much\u201d</p><p>Lucas squeezed his eyes closed entwined their legs and wrapped his arms impossibly tight around Eliotts waist.</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d He said. </p><p>\u201cSo so much\u201d</p><p>The End.</p><p>================================================</p><p>That\u2019s all Folks!

Eliott on one side Lucas on the other. The space between them hurt to look at but Eliott didn&rsquo;t dare move any closer. Lucas sat curled tightly into himself like the air brushing his skin hurt. Eliotts fingers twitched wanting to run his fingered through Lucas hair or hold his hand anything to comfort the boy. </p><p>Eliott took a deep breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Lucas i-&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait wait, can I say something first.&rdquo; Lucas interrupted, his eyes closed. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah yes of course&rdquo; Eliott nodded silently praying this won&rsquo;t be Lucas telling him this is the end.

Eliott&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;The truth is, I haven&rsquo;t been handling everything very well and I took it out on you.

The best thing that ever happened to me is when you came into my life and I never wanted to do anything to mess that up but I did, I ruined it and I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; Lucas sobbed.</p><p>Eliott couldn&rsquo;t resist anymore he jumped over to lucas side of the couch and pulled Lucas face in his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey hey Lucas, shhh it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Eliott pulled him to his chest breathing as slowly as he could. </p><p>Lucas was hesitant at first but eventually clung to Eliott&rsquo;s chest and sobbed into his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Lucas, just breath baby.

Even when Lucas is so broken down he is still worrying about Eliott and trying to comfort him forgetting about himself to make sure Eliott was okay.</p><p>&ldquo;You do so much for me.

You make me the best Eliott in any universe and I still don&rsquo;t deserve you&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas breath had calmed down but Eliott was still rocking them. Maybe to soothe himself more than to comfort his boyfriend at this point. Lucas was rubbing circles across Eliott&rsquo;s back calming him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I keep hurting you.&rdquo; Eliott whispered </p><p>&ldquo;I never want to hurt you or scare you or make you think I feel anything but absolute love for you.&rdquo; </p><p>Eliott placed his firm warm hands on either side of Lucas cheeks needing him too look Eliott in the eye to understand exactly how he felt. </p><p>&ldquo;You are the most important thing in my life Lucas. If everything else in the world is wrong as long as you&rsquo;re okay and you&rsquo;re with me nothing else matters.&rdquo; </p><p>The rough pad of Elliott&rsquo;s thumb stroked &nbsp;across Lucas flushed cheeks. </p><p> &ldquo;I love you so so much. Nothing will ever change that.&rdquo; Eliott said his voice steady with absolutely no room for argument. </p><p>Lucas lips pulled up in a small smile his eyes clearing and sparkling blue again as they always should be, filled to the brim with love. The pain and sadness that they held mere minutes ago all but a distant memory. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too&rdquo; </p><p>Eliott wrapped Lucas in the tightest hug he has ever given and Lucas did the same. The two crying boys sat in the silent apartment wrapped in their own world together. Eliott slowly pulled away and just looked at Lucas. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I kiss you?&rdquo; Lucas giggled but nodded</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to ask.&rdquo; </p><p>Eliott pulled Lucas towards him the two melted together into a sweet kiss. </p><p>They stayed there for a moment with no further intentions, no pressure to move any further than this. Just comfort and love.</p><p>The pulled away after a few moments with a sigh. Eliott proceeded to pepper kisses all over Lucas face making the younger boy giggle. Lucas gave him a smile his eyes sparkling with the remaining tears. Eliott sighed closing his eyes and resting their foreheads together.</p><p>They sat there for a moment breathing each other in. The traffic faded away in the background, the evening turning sharply into night. The world quieted around them as the streetlights shone through the curtains painting the room a warm yellow.</p><p>Eliott didn&rsquo;t want to break the peace but something was itching in the back of his head. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened with your parents?&rdquo; Eliott whispered. Afraid of spooking the boy. </p><p>Lucas looked down with a sigh. He was quiet for a few minutes Eliott thought he had forgotten his question and opened his lips to ask again.. </p><p>&ldquo;My mom. She had an episode. It was&hellip; pretty bad this time.&rdquo; Lucas finally answered in a small voice. </p><p>He pulled away looking Lucas in the eye. He took the smaller boys hands in his own giving them a small squeeze in support. </p><p>&ldquo;My dad went to visit her a few weeks ago and brought Josephine, the woman I told you about? Well turns out they are um getting married and my dad thought the best way to tell my mom was to take his shiny new fiance to the clinic he threw her in.&rdquo;</p><p>Anger flooded Lucas face as it often did when talking about his father. Eliott pulled him closer wrapping an arm around his shoulder urging him to continue. </p><p>&ldquo;This episode, it wasn&rsquo;t the worst but it lasted so long this time I was afraid I would never get her back.&rdquo; Lucas wiped a tear off his cheek shifting farthing into Eliott&rsquo;s embrace. </p><p>&ldquo;Her case worker Kathryn has been keeping me updated but it&rsquo;s been a few days since I&rsquo;ve heard anything so I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p><p>Eliott was shocked Lucas had kept all of this to himself for so long. He knew Lucas had been struggling but he had no idea it was about something this severe. </p><p>&ldquo;Is it really that bad?&rdquo; Eliott asked tentatively. &nbsp;</p><p>Lucas nodded his head he pulled his phone out of his back pocket opened it to their thread of messages and it and handed it to Eliott. </p><p>He scrolled through the messages week&rsquo;s and week&rsquo;s of Lucas trying to reach out but only being sent verses about judgment and sin and return from his mother. </p><p>Lucas was sniffling. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve called a hundred times I want to talk to her and help her as best I can but I can only do so much when she&rsquo;s like this. I just felt worthless&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott recalls Lucas being on his phone more often than usual but he figured it had been something to do with Yann or one of the girls. </p><p>He scrolled to the last two weeks of messages.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec8137d7e01bc9cf4fb6b688046c7786/tumblr_inline_psyh47g1Ic1rr0qs8_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\tEliott felt horrible. How could he not see this? Lucas mother was his family. She and Lucas had been suffering for weeks and he just didn&rsquo;t know ? What kind of a boyfriend was he. </p><p>He silently handed the phone back to Lucas and tightened his hand around the boys shoulders to reassure himself that Lucas was really there. </p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; He breathed out part of him too scared of the answer to voice the question out loudly. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know I-&ldquo; Lucas looked up collecting his thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to burden you with it I guess?&rdquo; He spoke quietly. Eliott was Hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Burden m-, Lucas? She is your mother, she is my family too, what happens to her and what&rsquo;s going on in her life is important to me, it&rsquo;s never a burden.&rdquo; Eliott said shaking his head in disbelief. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I really do know that it&rsquo;s just&hellip; when this kind of thing happens it&nbsp; reminds me of everything we have been through and I hate having to remember my life that way. She has been so good for so long before my dad screwed it up just like he screwed up our lives before and it makes me remember&hellip; how broken my family really is. I just don&rsquo;t like remembering that that was my life.&rdquo; Lucas finished quietly </p><p>Elliot&rsquo;s face softened He pulled the boy into his arms </p><p>&ldquo;Your family is not broken Lucas. Yes, your dad did horrible things and I Wish I could take those memories so you don&rsquo;t have to live with them I really do. But, you have your mom who loves you, and Yann and Arthur and Basile and the girls and me. You will always have me. And <i>we</i> are not broken okay?&rdquo; Eliott said firmly. </p><p>Lucas nodded. Eliott has never said something with so much conviction before, with no room for negotiation Lucas had not choice but to believe him. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>They sat together for a while longer holding each other, Elliott laying on his back With Lucas pulled flush against his chest, talking about everything and nothing. Plans for a trip south in the summer, what to do for Arthur&rsquo;s birthday, maybe painting their bedroom blue, a new recipe that Elliott found which will surely end in disaster. Just talking to talk.</p><p>After a while they both fell silent just wrapped up in each other enjoying the quiet moment. </p><p>&ldquo;I feel gross&rdquo; Lucas said loudly wiping his nose on the back of his sleeve. </p><p>Well so much for that quiet moment. </p><p>Eliottt burst out laughing his chest vibrating underneath Lucas with every chuckle. He looked up fondly at the boy, his eyes sparkling, his cheeks blotchy, and pink his hair sticking up in every direction his nose rubbed raw on his sleeve. He was beautiful. </p><p>He rolled them over so Luca was on his side on the couch then stood up holding his hand out for the boy </p><p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; He smiled down at him</p><p>Lucas raised his eyebrows but took Eliott&rsquo;s had nonetheless and followed him. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Eliott led them to the bathroom. Lucas was so tired from his roller coaster of a day he just sat down on the toilet lid while Eliott turned the shower on. The hot water warmed the room almost instantly and the steam cleared his nose and soothed his raw throat relaxing his aching muscles. He closed his eyes for a second while his boyfriend went to get them clothes to change into. He felt Eliott fingers thread through his hair pushing it away from his face and kissing his forehead, he opened his eyes and everything was ready for them.</p><p> &ldquo;Showers ready babe, are you too tired?&rdquo; Eliott asked his, still running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;No no I&rsquo;m good just give me a second&rdquo; Lucas said rubbing his sleepy eyes trying to wake up enough to take a much needed shower. </p><p>Eliott stood in front of him and started to undress himself, throwing his shirt into the hamper and kicking of his jeans and boxers. </p><p>Lucas eyes were only half way open and his head was resting back against the wall but still let out a little wolf whistle to his boyfriend. </p><p>Eliott chuckled shaking his head at his sleepy boyfriend. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to help you get undressed.&rdquo; Eliott asked both walking to stand right in front of Lucas with both hands on his shoulders squeezing them lightly. </p><p>Lucas let out a little pfft. </p><p>&ldquo;Like that&rsquo;s ever been a question&rdquo; he giggled </p><p>He held out his hands and Eliott pulled him up to a standing position. Lucas lifted his arms and attempted to pull his shirt over his head. It got stuck on his shoulders and he really didn&rsquo;t have the energy to care. </p><p>&ldquo;A little help please&rdquo; he chuckled, his voice muffled but the cotton all wrapped around his head </p><p>Eliott laughed at the sight of his boyfriend. </p><p>&ldquo;What am I gonna do with you?&rdquo; He said, shaking his head. </p><p>Eliott helped him pull his shirt over his head and then helped him get his pants and boxers off. </p><p>When they were both finally undressed Eliott walked a tried Lucas into the shower. </p><p>He closed the door behind him and pulled the shorter boy to his chest. </p><p>Lucas was already close to passing out but now with the hot water pounding the knots out of his shoulders and Eliott&rsquo;s scent surround him as he pressed his face further into the taller boys neck he was really having a hard time staying awake. </p><p>Eliott reached over and grabbed their coconut scented body was squeezing a heaping dollop on a wash cloth and rubbed it across Lucas back soothingly working the strain out of his muscles and cleaning the grime of the day off of him. He leaned him away to rub his chest and shoulders until he was squeaky clean. Eliott spent longer then he probably needed to washing Lucas but he wanted his boy to feel good and cared for and loved. </p><p>Eliott took their sweet smelling shampoo bottle in his hands intending on washing Lucas hair but Lucas grappled his wrist. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait! I wanna do yours first.&rdquo; Lucas said quietly </p><p>Eliott chuckled but handed the bottle to Lucas nodding. </p><p>Lucas took some of the shampoo into his hands and reached up on his tiptoes to scrub Eliott&rsquo;s hair. He was struggling a bit with his balance which was much funnier to the taller boy then it probably should have been. He was stifling laughs while Lucas did a little jig failing to stay still on his toes. </p><p>Lucas Huffed and smiled</p><p> &ldquo;You know you could actually help me instead of laughing like a jackass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; Eliott said still laughing but leant down resting his head on Lucas shoulder so the shorter boy wouldn&rsquo;t have to reach so far up to him. </p><p>Lucas shook his head laughing </p><p>&ldquo;Asshole&rdquo; He said fondly. </p><p>Lucas combed the shampoo through Elliot&rsquo;s hair. His nails massaging his scalp working the product into his hair and skin. The sweet smell wafting in the room mixing with the steam till it surrounded them.</p><p>After scrubbing his hair a lot longer then he definitely needed he pulled Eliotts head up from his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;There, squeaky clean.&rdquo; He said with a smile.</p><p>Eliott smiled back at him turning around quickly to rinse out the shampoo before squeezing some onto his own palm. </p><p>&ldquo;My turn&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas walked stood in front of him while Eliott scrubbed his hair. He massages his scalp and his temples then reached around to rub the back of his neck. </p><p>Lucas was so relaxed he closed his eyes and let out a little sigh. He held onto Eliotts waist for balance rubbing his hands slowly up and down his sides. </p><p>The repetitive motion luled them both into a trance. Lucas still had his eyes closed, feeling almost numb he was so relaxed. </p><p>Eliott kissed his forehead, bringing him back to life. </p><p>&ldquo;Come one, lets go to bed.&rdquo; Eliott smiled down at him. </p><p>They stepped out of the shower drying themselves off pulled on some clean T-shirt&rsquo;s and boxers then made their way to their bedroom. </p><p>Lucas climbed into the bed instantly sinking deep into the cold clean sheets and pulled their comforter up to his chin. Eliott walked over and opened the curtains before turning the light off. His boyfriend never could sleep in a completely dark room. </p><p>Eliott finally climbed into and instantly pulled Lucas tight into his arms. The shorter boys head was tucked safely under Eliotts chin and his ear was resting right above his heart.The steady thrumming of Eliotts heart comforting Lucas and sending him to the brink of sleep. </p><p>But sleep didn&rsquo;t come for Lucas. </p><p>He laid there thinking about the good moments he and Eliott had, all the hugs, the talks, the kisses. But all those memories were being overshadowed by one big ugly one that sat in front of his mind. The only thing he saw when he closed his eyes. </p><p>Eliott felt Lucas stiffen up more and more as they laid together. He rubbed his warm hands across Lucas back trying to soothe whatever was going on in his mind. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; Eliott whispered to Lucas. </p><p>Lucas took a minute to respond not sure if it he should tell Eliott what was going through his head but they had been so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honest with each other today he didn&rsquo;t want to break that. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rdquo; he finally Settled on. It wasn&rsquo;t untrue but it wasn&rsquo;t the whole truth and Eliott knew that. </p><p>He nodded and &nbsp;tightened his grip on Lucas waist. </p><p>Lucas was quiet after that and Eliott thought he had finally fallen asleep when Lucas spoke again quietly almost a whisper, like he didn&rsquo;t actually want Eliott to hear him say it. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t watch you do that again Eliott.&rdquo; Lucas said his voice cracking and it broke Eliott&rsquo;s heart all over again.</p><p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott nodded pulling him back to his chest trying to protect him from the world. </p><p>&ldquo;When I was younger&rdquo; Lucas started then paused breathing for a moment </p><p> &ldquo;When my parents were really starting to break apart, I watched my dad walk out on us over and over again. Every time he walked out that door I never knew if it was the last time I would ever see him until finally&hellip; it was.&rdquo; </p><p>Eliott tightened his arms around Lucas. His arms a barricade between Lucas and the world outside their bedroom. </p><p>&ldquo;I need you to do something for me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Anything&rdquo; Eliott replied instantly Rubbing his hands across Lucas back and through his hair. </p><p>&ldquo;If you need space or, if we argue and you need some time away from me.. please, just please don&rsquo;t walk out the door. Tell me you need to be alone and ill leave the minute you need it. I will leave you alone for as long as you need I promise just don&rsquo;t walk out on me because&hellip;&rdquo; Lucas paused tears falling faster down his cheeks</p><p> &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ll always come back to you. But you might not always come back to me.&rdquo; Lucas was quiet expect the soft tears falling from his eyes. </p><p>Eliott pulled him away with a hand on either side of his face. Eliott was heartbroken that Lucas felt this way. </p><p>&ldquo;Lucas&hellip; I&rdquo; Eliott started but Lucas cut him off before his thought was even out. </p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s irrational. I know in my heart you love me and don&rsquo;t want to leave me. I don&rsquo;t doubt that even for a second when I&rsquo;m good but&hellip; in the bad times when my head and my heart aren&rsquo;t on the same page I just&hellip; I need you to do this for me. To make me feel safe. Please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott nodded. He had a soft expression on his face as he cupped Lucas face and wiped the tears spilling out of his eyes. He had cried so much today it&rsquo;s amazing there&rsquo;s any tears left. </p><p>Lucas smiled up at him and smiled, nodding.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p>They didn&rsquo;t say anything for a while after that &nbsp;they just looked at each other. Lying nose to nose breathing each other and the moment. &nbsp;Eliott moved slowly and placed a kiss on Lucas forehead so gentle it almost hurt then another on his cheek before finally pressing their lips together. Eliott kissed Lucas soft but deeply into him trying to engrain Lucas with his love forever. </p><p>They pulled apart and looked at each other again. Lucas tilted his head up and pressed a little kiss to the tip of Eliotts nose. </p><p>Eliott smiled and pulled Lucas to him crushing him against his chest wrapping his arms around his shoulders and burying his face in his soft hair. &nbsp;</p><p>Lucas wrapped his arms tightly around waist holding him close. </p><p>&ldquo; I love you&rdquo; Eliott said quietly, his lips pressing to words into Lucas skin, his voice muffled by their closeness.</p><p>&ldquo;So so much&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas squeezed his eyes closed entwined their legs and wrapped his arms impossibly tight around Eliotts waist.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too&rdquo; He said. </p><p>&ldquo;So so much&rdquo;</p><p>The End.</p><p>================================================</p><p>That&rsquo;s all Folks! (I&rsquo;m so sorry this was so long lol) Thank you so so so much for reading this fic I hope you liked it and where satisfied with the ending!! </p><p>If you have any ideas for little fics and want me to write something don&rsquo;t be shy feel free to ask me! </p></p>",

I still liked it) Imane&rsquo;s season is that compared to Sana&rsquo;s where the relationships are those of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; teenagers in France they made most of them almost toxic/problematic at times and made characters like Eliott and Lucas fight and it felt so unnecessary when Manon and Charles are already fighting in the same scene. Sofiane dated Manon and was pretty ambiguous as a character in the end when he could have been more fleshed out, seen with Idriss and their friends, etc&hellip; In short, I think they made it too negative and heavy. It&rsquo;d have worked better in show with like 25 episodes to resolve everything satisfyingly and not with a show like Skam with only 10 episodes of 20 minutes.</p>",
