        "body": "<p>When Bruce was ten, he got a board game called \u201cGuess Who?\u201d for his birthday. It was brand new back then, just published, and his mother paid more for it than she could probably afford. It was probably also a bit too childish for Bruce, who was ten and advanced for his age, but he loved the game to pieces.</p><p>On some gloomy mornings, when Brian wasn\u2019t home, Rebecca would sit and play with him, and Bruce cherished every game with her. They played thirteen games before summer came and Rebecca tried to run away with Bruce, and Brian killed her. When Brian was locked up and Bruce went to live with the Walters\u2019, he took the game with him. </p><p>It took three years before Jen found it and asked him to play. He looked at the box, still looking new and carrying too many memories and he got mad, threw her out, and cried the whole evening. When she came to apologize the next day, he offered to play with her himself. When he went on the run, he sneaked back to his old flat for the game that was full of memories of his mother and Jen. </p><p>Every time, when running, he would make sure the game was safe somewhere, and every time he would come back for it. </p><p>When he moved into The Tower, he put it on a shelf and he felt strangely settled, having it there like that, for the first time since it was in his and Jen\u2019s room. He felt like it belonged on that shelf the way he belonged in that room. </p><p>So well. Bruce wouldn\u2019t say he was a fan of board games. He liked them just fine, but that one? He loved that one. Still, when Tony announced a board game team evening, Bruce couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>They all ended up sprawled around the living room, bowl of popcorn laying around because popcorn was a part of bonding nights even if movies weren\u2019t involved, and Tony brought a huge stack of board games. Or to be precise, he brought a huge stack of Avengers licensed board games. </p><p>Steve was staring at them as if he wasn\u2019t sure if they were real or just Tony\u2019s home made prank, Natasha kept stuffing herself with popcorn with mild interest, Clint looked excited as he started talking to Tony about the titles and Thor laughed. </p><p>Bruce smiled, and started shuffling the boxes, checking what games there were. He passes a Rummikub (seriously? How do you make a themed Rummikub? Marketing was amazing) and Monopoly, which quickly gets snatched by still over-hyped Clint, and then he sees it. </p><p>This box looks just the same but he\u2019s the one on the cards and there\u2019s Clint, and Tony, and Steve, even Rhodey and other superheroes. There\u2019s Matt and Jen and Jessica and there\u2019s Charles and Eric and Ororo&hellip; Bruce feels an elbow nudge in his side and turns to find Tony smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cWanna play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a two person game, Tony. It\u2019s a team night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Tony smiles and Bruce feels so grateful for the friendship, the <i>home</i> Tony offered him, all of them, here. \u201cThe other decided on Monopoly and I <i>loathe</i> Monopoly plus it\u2019s best for four players. Let\u2019s let them have fun explaining it to Thor and we enjoy describing ourselves, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Bruce wants to make a jab how of course Tony loves a game that allows him to focus on who he is but decides not to be an asshole.
