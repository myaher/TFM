(Happy ending bc they deserve it)</p><p>*This was in my notes from agesss ago, but I scrapped it bc I didn\u2019t like it at the time. I\u2019ve changed a few things and now (hopefully) it\u2019s better.*</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cHey, can you ask TJ if he likes me?\u201d</p><p>A choked noise escaped Buffy, and she violently began coughing through a mouthful of vanilla milkshake. Cyrus rushed to her aid, apologising profusely as he clapped her on the back. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating!\u201d she yelled once she had successfully swallowed her milkshake. </p><p>Cyrus just folded his arms, pouting stubbornly. \u00a0\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat never works on me and you know it. Unlike TJ, I don\u2019t turn into an agreeable puddle whenever you pout.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus chose to ignore the comment. \u201cBuffy, do it for me. Your <i>best friend</i>.\u201d he begged.</p><p>She scoffed and picked up a baby tater, toying with it as she contemplated. \u201c<i>Fine</i>.\u201d she huffed. \u201cI\u2019m blaming <i>you </i>if TJ laughs in my face though.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus grinned. \u201cThank you! I love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. What brought this on, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell&hellip;he\u2019s been avoiding me all week.\u201d</p><p>Buffy lowered the baby tater she was holding then, her face soft. \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s been avoiding you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked.\u201d Cyrus sighed. \u201cFirst of all, on Monday, he didn\u2019t sit with me at lunch. This may seem innocent enough, but when I asked him about it later he panicked, said it was nothing and changed the subject! Then, on Tuesday, he couldn\u2019t walk home with me after school and he acted just as suspicious! Then, on Wednesday-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay - I get the point,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him. In fact, speaking of the devil&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He followed Buddy\u2019s gaze towards the entrance, and sure enough TJ had walked into the diner. His eyes met Cyrus\u2019 and a bright smile immediately came to his lips. </p><p>Before he could even take a step in their direction however, Buffy was standing up and marching over to him.</p><p>Cyrus braced himself for some aggression from his friend, but to his surprise it never came. TJ asked her a question, before nodding and gesturing to a table in the corner of the diner.</p><p>He sighed and pulled out his phone, knowing well that there was no way he could eavesdrop without being noticed.</p><p>After a few minutes of scrolling, Cyrus was already becoming restless. He shifted a few times in his seat, before hesitantly standing up and looking around. He walked in the vague direction of their table, pretending to tap away at his phone as he passed. He kept a few metres between them, and was able to catch a fleeting snippet of what Buffy was saying to his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot, TJ. Just tell him what happened!\u201d </p><p><i>Tell me that </i>what <i>happened?</i></p><p>He turned away and grabbed some napkins from the counter, his mind reeling. Soon, he sat back down at his table, trying desperately not to overthink what TJ could possibly be keeping from him.</p><p>After another minute or so, his boyfriend slid into the booth next to him and wrapped an arm around him, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey, muffin. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d he responded automatically, forcing a smile onto his lips. \u201cWere you busy again at lunch today?\u201d</p><p>He felt TJ tense next to him, and he let out a deflated sigh. </p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll be free again next week.\u201d </p><p>Buffy coughed pointedly and gave him a brief glare before returning to her milkshake. </p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;how about we get out of here?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cBut Buffy-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d she interrupted. \u201cGo with him, Cyrus.\u201d </p><p>\u201c&hellip;Okay.\u201d</p><p>There was an unusual distance between them as they walked outside, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but feel worried. </p><p>He hadn\u2019t even considered the possibility of TJ wanting to break up with him, but now it was all he could think about. It made sense the more he thought about it; he had always viewed himself as being <i>miles </i>out of the athlete\u2019s league. Maybe TJ had finally realised this too.</p><p>The boy looked over at him as they began to walk through the freshly-fallen leaves, and Cyrus\u2019 heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he began. \u201cYou asked Buffy to ask me if I still like you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question; it was a statement. Cyrus couldn\u2019t deny it, although a part of him wanted to, so he just shoved his hands in his pockets and nodded meekly.</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned that you think I\u2019ve been avoiding you all week.\u201d</p><p>Another meek nod.</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, I like you so much that I can\u2019t believe it sometimes. You\u2019re the best thing to ever happen to me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus relaxed almost instantly at that, ducking his hide a blush that he really couldn\u2019t attribute to the cold.</p><p>TJ moved closer to him until their swinging hands were brushing as they walked. Cyrus heard him take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I may have gotten myself into a bit of a situation at school last Friday.\u201d</p><p>The brown-haired boy immediately froze. TJ stopped walking when he realised this and turned around.</p><p>\u201cTJ&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you think! Or - maybe it is. I\u2019m not sure. You just mean a lot to me and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>TJ bowed his head, shame written all over his face. He mumbled something then, but it was so jumbled that Cyrus couldn\u2019t make it out.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got into a fight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou <i>what</i>-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt was just a few punches!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few punches? Great, now I don\u2019t need to be worried-\u201c</p><p>\u201cCyrus, I\u2019m <i>fine!</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were at detention everyday this week, weren\u2019t you? At lunch? And after school?\u201d</p><p>TJ slowly lifted his head. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus began to tug at his hair, which was a particularly bad nervous habit he had picked up over the last couple of months. The athlete quickly noticed this and stepped forward with a frown, gently swatting the boy\u2019s hands away from his hair.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, everything\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHow did it even happen? Did you start it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo you used violence for no reason whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>For the few moments neither of them spoke. They just stood amongst the leaves, staring at each other as if they could silently finish their conversation through facial expressions alone. </p><p>TJ looked conflicted. Cyrus had his arms folded and an eyebrow raised expectantly. Tension was beginning to crackle in the air around them.</p><p>\u201c<i>God</i>. He was talking about you, okay?! He was saying stuff about you being gay! I just got mad and it seemed like the quickest way to get back at him. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but soften as he stepped forward, a reluctant smile tugging at his lips. </p><p>\u201cYou were defending me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my <i>gosh</i>, TJ. You\u2019re an idiot for doing that, but&hellip;the intent was sweet. Just - please don\u2019t punch people unless you really, really have to. There\u2019s usually other options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really, really had to.\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy couldn\u2019t help but snort. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>TJ beamed at him then, and Cyrus was completely done for.</p><p>\u201cYou make it very hard for me to be mad at you, you know?\u201d </p><p>As if to prove his point, the shorter boy stepped forward and looped his arms around TJ\u2019s neck. The athlete smirked and lowered his hands to Cyrus\u2019 waist.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help my charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019m still mad that you got a week\u2019s worth of detentions without telling me, you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ dragged his eyes down to Cyrus\u2019 lips in an almost exaggerated fashion. \u201cThat sucks. How can I make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy could already feel his heart racing; a side effect that hadn\u2019t decreased in the slightest since they had first started dating. </p><p>\u201cWell&hellip;\u201d he trailed off, pretending to think about it for a moment. \u201cI <i>guess </i>a kiss wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d </p><p>TJ was more than happy to oblige, and soon, he was dipping his head and connecting his lips with Cyrus\u2019. As always, the shorter boy felt himself melting as he pressed into it, trying hard to fight back a smile.</p><p>Although they eventually had to separate for air, they remained at the same proximity. </p><p>\u201cWhat was he saying about me?\u201d Cyrus mumbled. </p><p>TJ just shook his head. \u201cIt was stupid stuff. Can we kiss again?\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy smiled and nodded. He couldn\u2019t find it within himself to worry about other people when this ridiculous (but cute) boy was right in front of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGet down here then, you giant.\u201d</p><p>The athlete grinned and leant down the slightest amount, leaving a purposeful gap between their lips.</p><p>\u201cI think you may be catching up a bit.\u201d</p><p>He giggled at that. \u201cWatch out - I\u2019ll be the taller one soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not get too ahead of ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted and stood on his tippy-toes, splaying his hands across TJ\u2019s chest for balance and bringing their lips together again.</p>",

(Happy ending bc they deserve it)</p><p>*This was in my notes from agesss ago, but I scrapped it bc I didn\u2019t like it at the time. I\u2019ve changed a few things and now (hopefully) it\u2019s better.*</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cHey, can you ask TJ if he likes me?\u201d</p><p>A choked noise escaped Buffy, and she violently began coughing through a mouthful of vanilla milkshake. Cyrus rushed to her aid, apologising profusely as he clapped her on the back. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating!\u201d she yelled once she had successfully swallowed her milkshake. </p><p>Cyrus just folded his arms, pouting stubbornly. \u00a0\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat never works on me and you know it. Unlike TJ, I don\u2019t turn into an agreeable puddle whenever you pout.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus chose to ignore the comment. \u201cBuffy, do it for me. Your <i>best friend</i>.\u201d he begged.</p><p>She scoffed and picked up a baby tater, toying with it as she contemplated. \u201c<i>Fine</i>.\u201d she huffed. \u201cI\u2019m blaming <i>you </i>if TJ laughs in my face though.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus grinned. \u201cThank you! I love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. What brought this on, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026he\u2019s been avoiding me all week.\u201d</p><p>Buffy lowered the baby tater she was holding then, her face soft. \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s been avoiding you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked.\u201d Cyrus sighed. \u201cFirst of all, on Monday, he didn\u2019t sit with me at lunch. This may seem innocent enough, but when I asked him about it later he panicked, said it was nothing and changed the subject! Then, on Tuesday, he couldn\u2019t walk home with me after school and he acted just as suspicious! Then, on Wednesday-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay - I get the point,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him. In fact, speaking of the devil\u2026\u201d</p><p>He followed Buddy\u2019s gaze towards the entrance, and sure enough TJ had walked into the diner. His eyes met Cyrus\u2019 and a bright smile immediately came to his lips. </p><p>Before he could even take a step in their direction however, Buffy was standing up and marching over to him.</p><p>Cyrus braced himself for some aggression from his friend, but to his surprise it never came. TJ asked her a question, before nodding and gesturing to a table in the corner of the diner.</p><p>He sighed and pulled out his phone, knowing well that there was no way he could eavesdrop without being noticed.</p><p>After a few minutes of scrolling, Cyrus was already becoming restless. He shifted a few times in his seat, before hesitantly standing up and looking around. He walked in the vague direction of their table, pretending to tap away at his phone as he passed. He kept a few metres between them, and was able to catch a fleeting snippet of what Buffy was saying to his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot, TJ. Just tell him what happened!\u201d </p><p><i>Tell me that </i>what <i>happened?</i></p><p>He turned away and grabbed some napkins from the counter, his mind reeling. Soon, he sat back down at his table, trying desperately not to overthink what TJ could possibly be keeping from him.</p><p>After another minute or so, his boyfriend slid into the booth next to him and wrapped an arm around him, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey, muffin. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d he responded automatically, forcing a smile onto his lips. \u201cWere you busy again at lunch today?\u201d</p><p>He felt TJ tense next to him, and he let out a deflated sigh. </p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll be free again next week.\u201d </p><p>Buffy coughed pointedly and gave him a brief glare before returning to her milkshake. </p><p>\u201cUm\u2026how about we get out of here?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cBut Buffy-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d she interrupted. \u201cGo with him, Cyrus.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d</p><p>There was an unusual distance between them as they walked outside, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but feel worried. </p><p>He hadn\u2019t even considered the possibility of TJ wanting to break up with him, but now it was all he could think about. It made sense the more he thought about it; he had always viewed himself as being <i>miles </i>out of the athlete\u2019s league. Maybe TJ had finally realised this too.</p><p>The boy looked over at him as they began to walk through the freshly-fallen leaves, and Cyrus\u2019 heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he began. \u201cYou asked Buffy to ask me if I still like you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question; it was a statement. Cyrus couldn\u2019t deny it, although a part of him wanted to, so he just shoved his hands in his pockets and nodded meekly.</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned that you think I\u2019ve been avoiding you all week.\u201d</p><p>Another meek nod.</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, I like you so much that I can\u2019t believe it sometimes. You\u2019re the best thing to ever happen to me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus relaxed almost instantly at that, ducking his hide a blush that he really couldn\u2019t attribute to the cold.</p><p>TJ moved closer to him until their swinging hands were brushing as they walked. Cyrus heard him take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I may have gotten myself into a bit of a situation at school last Friday.\u201d</p><p>The brown-haired boy immediately froze. TJ stopped walking when he realised this and turned around.</p><p>\u201cTJ\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you think! Or - maybe it is. I\u2019m not sure. You just mean a lot to me and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>TJ bowed his head, shame written all over his face. He mumbled something then, but it was so jumbled that Cyrus couldn\u2019t make it out.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got into a fight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou <i>what</i>-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt was just a few punches!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few punches? Great, now I don\u2019t need to be worried-\u201c</p><p>\u201cCyrus, I\u2019m <i>fine!</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were at detention everyday this week, weren\u2019t you? At lunch? And after school?\u201d</p><p>TJ slowly lifted his head. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus began to tug at his hair, which was a particularly bad nervous habit he had picked up over the last couple of months. The athlete quickly noticed this and stepped forward with a frown, gently swatting the boy\u2019s hands away from his hair.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, everything\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHow did it even happen? Did you start it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo you used violence for no reason whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>For the few moments neither of them spoke. They just stood amongst the leaves, staring at each other as if they could silently finish their conversation through facial expressions alone. </p><p>TJ looked conflicted. Cyrus had his arms folded and an eyebrow raised expectantly. Tension was beginning to crackle in the air around them.</p><p>\u201c<i>God</i>. He was talking about you, okay?! He was saying stuff about you being gay! I just got mad and it seemed like the quickest way to get back at him. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but soften as he stepped forward, a reluctant smile tugging at his lips. </p><p>\u201cYou were defending me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my <i>gosh</i>, TJ. You\u2019re an idiot for doing that, but\u2026the intent was sweet. Just - please don\u2019t punch people unless you really, really have to. There\u2019s usually other options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really, really had to.\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy couldn\u2019t help but snort. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>TJ beamed at him then, and Cyrus was completely done for.</p><p>\u201cYou make it very hard for me to be mad at you, you know?\u201d </p><p>As if to prove his point, the shorter boy stepped forward and looped his arms around TJ\u2019s neck. The athlete smirked and lowered his hands to Cyrus\u2019 waist.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help my charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019m still mad that you got a week\u2019s worth of detentions without telling me, you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ dragged his eyes down to Cyrus\u2019 lips in an almost exaggerated fashion. \u201cThat sucks. How can I make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy could already feel his heart racing; a side effect that hadn\u2019t decreased in the slightest since they had first started dating. </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he trailed off, pretending to think about it for a moment. \u201cI <i>guess </i>a kiss wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d </p><p>TJ was more than happy to oblige, and soon, he was dipping his head and connecting his lips with Cyrus\u2019. As always, the shorter boy felt himself melting as he pressed into it, trying hard to fight back a smile.</p><p>Although they eventually had to separate for air, they remained at the same proximity. </p><p>\u201cWhat was he saying about me?\u201d Cyrus mumbled. </p><p>TJ just shook his head. \u201cIt was stupid stuff. Can we kiss again?\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy smiled and nodded. He couldn\u2019t find it within himself to worry about other people when this ridiculous (but cute) boy was right in front of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGet down here then, you giant.\u201d</p><p>The athlete grinned and leant down the slightest amount, leaving a purposeful gap between their lips.</p><p>\u201cI think you may be catching up a bit.\u201d</p><p>He giggled at that. \u201cWatch out - I\u2019ll be the taller one soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not get too ahead of ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted and stood on his tippy-toes, splaying his hands across TJ\u2019s chest for balance and bringing their lips together again.</p></p>",

Hey.\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>Buffy blinked and woke up suddenly. It was so sudden, in fact, that TJ was a bit startled when she sat up right away. \u201cG\u2019morning,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d TJ, with some effort, moved to a standing position and offered a hand to Buffy. She took it, seeming a bit surprised.</p><p>\u201cSo. Do you, um, want something to eat?\u201d Buffy asked, standing up as well.</p><p>TJ glanced at his phone\u2014 it was nearly noon. \u201cOh, shoot. I have work in an hour. I should probably go,\u201d he said, clearly wanting nothing of the sort.</p><p>\u201cOh.

See you.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>They exchanged a civil nod and TJ opened the door. \u201cOh, and, TJ,\u201d Buffy said, after a moment of consideration, \u201cgood luck. With everything. With Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Buffy exclaimed. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d TJ turned and smirked.</p><p>\u201cDo you, uh, want to come to the Spoon later? With me and Andi and Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d TJ said after thinking for a minute. \u201cI get off at 2:30.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee you around, Driscoll.\u201d</p><p>The door shut, and the former rivals each let out a breath neither had realized they\u2019d been holding. </p><p>Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a door was opening. Cyrus Goodman was stepping into Andi Mack\u2019s living room. </p><p>\u201cHey, Andi,\u201d said Cyrus brightly, walking into his friend\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy,\u201d Andi replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br/><br/></p><p>\u201cOh, not much. How about you?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus and Andi sat down at the kitchen table, where Andi poured two glasses of watermelon juice. \u201cThe same. Bex and Cece are out trying on wedding dresses. Bowie\u2019s at the Red Rooster. I\u2019ve just been hanging out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go with Bex? I would\u2019ve thought that you would have jumped at the chance to pair wedding planning with fashion.\u201d Cyrus sipped the juice and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wanted to, but Cece thought that I shouldn\u2019t see her until the wedding day. Bad luck or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet Bex would\u2019ve rather had you go in her place.\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed. \u201cYeah.\u201d There was a pause between the two. Peace. It wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortable in the slightest; the two friends were close enough that they could just sit in silence for hours and have a good time. Andi piped up again after a moment, though. \u201cSo, have you heard from Buffy today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Cyrus had texted Buffy earlier, but she hadn\u2019t responded. He told Andi this then, and a concerned look crossed her face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. Buffy\u2019s usually quick to text back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Probably just slept in.\u201d </p><p>As if on cue, Andi\u2019s phone beeped. \u201cIt\u2019s Buffy,\u201d she informed Cyrus. \u201cShe wants to meet us at the Spoon in a little bit. 2 and a half hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. She say anything else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh, yeah&hellip;she\u2019s typing.\u201d Another beep.

I\u2019m glad they\u2019re getting along. Wonder why, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Weird.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, the pair approached their group\u2019s longtime meeting spot. \u201cYou ready?\u201d Andi asked Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>Andi shrugged, looking reluctant, but she followed Cyrus into the Spoon as the bell tinkled. She scanned the room and located her best friend sitting across from her former rival. Andi nudged Cyrus and gestured in TJ\u2019s and Buffy\u2019s direction, and they began walking towards the others.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys!\u201d Buffy greeted them cheerfully as Andi sat next to her and Cyrus sat next to TJ. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Andi responded, nodding. Cyrus gave a small wave.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d asked Cyrus, looking from TJ to Buffy.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d Buffy said casually. \u201cHey, Amber. We ordered for you guys.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus and Andi greeted Amber as she served four milkshakes\u2013 vanilla for Andi, strawberry for Buffy, chocolate for Cyrus, and Oreo for TJ\u2013 and two orders of baby taters. </p><p>\u201cBon appetit,\u201d Amber muttered, walking away tiredly.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Andi began awkwardly. \u201cWhy\u2026are you guys, um, hanging out?\u201d</p><p>TJ and Buffy looked at each other, half-smiling. \u201cWell,\u201d Buffy said tentatively. \u201cWe, um, had a sleepover last night.\u201d</p><p>Andi and Cyrus were surprised, to say the least. \u201cWell!\u201d Cyrus said, a bit too loud. \u201cUm, I\u2019m glad you guys are getting along!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d TJ said, giving Buffy a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cThis is\u2026bizarre,\u201d Andi whispered, leaning across the table to Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cI have to agree,\u201d he responded.</p><p>After TJ went to work, Buffy stood up. \u201cI should head out, too. Got some&hellip;stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff?\u201d asked Andi pointedly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stuff. School stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d called Cyrus as she left.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up with that?\u201d Andi whispered confidentially.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus was oblivious.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re, like, obviously dating, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cyrus said, realizing. \u201cThat\u2019s&hellip;nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s so bad! What if TJ hurts her?\u201d</p><p>But Cyrus wasn\u2019t listening. He agreed that, yes, it was bad, but unlike Andi, he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on why.</p>",

He blinked for a few seconds and looked down to see Buffy, still sleeping on the floor next to the couch. He sat up, nudged her shoulder and whispered. \u201cBuffy. Hey.\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>Buffy blinked and woke up suddenly. It was so sudden, in fact, that TJ was a bit startled when she sat up right away. \u201cG\u2019morning,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d TJ, with some effort, moved to a standing position and offered a hand to Buffy. She took it, seeming a bit surprised.</p><p>\u201cSo. Do you, um, want something to eat?\u201d Buffy asked, standing up as well.</p><p>TJ glanced at his phone\u2014 it was nearly noon. \u201cOh, shoot. I have work in an hour. I should probably go,\u201d he said, clearly wanting nothing of the sort.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Buffy nodded. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll see you at school.\u201d</p><p>TJ was zipping up his jacket. \u201cYeah. See you.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>They exchanged a civil nod and TJ opened the door. \u201cOh, and, TJ,\u201d Buffy said, after a moment of consideration, \u201cgood luck. With everything. With Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Buffy exclaimed. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d TJ turned and smirked.</p><p>\u201cDo you, uh, want to come to the Spoon later? With me and Andi and Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d TJ said after thinking for a minute. \u201cI get off at 2:30.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee you around, Driscoll.\u201d</p><p>The door shut, and the former rivals each let out a breath neither had realized they\u2019d been holding. </p><p>Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a door was opening. Cyrus Goodman was stepping into Andi Mack\u2019s living room. </p><p>\u201cHey, Andi,\u201d said Cyrus brightly, walking into his friend\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cy,\u201d Andi replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cOh, not much. How about you?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus and Andi sat down at the kitchen table, where Andi poured two glasses of watermelon juice. \u201cThe same. Bex and Cece are out trying on wedding dresses. Bowie\u2019s at the Red Rooster. I\u2019ve just been hanging out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go with Bex? I would\u2019ve thought that you would have jumped at the chance to pair wedding planning with fashion.\u201d Cyrus sipped the juice and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wanted to, but Cece thought that I shouldn\u2019t see her until the wedding day. Bad luck or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet Bex would\u2019ve rather had you go in her place.\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed. \u201cYeah.\u201d There was a pause between the two. Peace. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable in the slightest; the two friends were close enough that they could just sit in silence for hours and have a good time. Andi piped up again after a moment, though. \u201cSo, have you heard from Buffy today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Cyrus had texted Buffy earlier, but she hadn\u2019t responded. He told Andi this then, and a concerned look crossed her face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. Buffy\u2019s usually quick to text back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Probably just slept in.\u201d </p><p>As if on cue, Andi\u2019s phone beeped. \u201cIt\u2019s Buffy,\u201d she informed Cyrus. \u201cShe wants to meet us at the Spoon in a little bit. 2 and a half hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. She say anything else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2026she\u2019s typing.\u201d Another beep. Andi looked at her phone in shock.<br><br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bringing TJ.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus raised his eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s great! I\u2019m glad they\u2019re getting along. Wonder why, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Weird.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, the pair approached their group\u2019s longtime meeting spot. \u201cYou ready?\u201d Andi asked Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>Andi shrugged, looking reluctant, but she followed Cyrus into the Spoon as the bell tinkled. She scanned the room and located her best friend sitting across from her former rival.
