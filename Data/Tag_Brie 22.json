Little sniffles and cries managed to sneak out every few seconds, making you more frustrated and upset. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou cheated on me! I thought we were happy!\u201d You yelled as even more tears came out. Brie looked at you with her own watery eyes and frown. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWe were happy and we can still be happy, baby. You just have to give me a chance.\u201d Brie calmly said. She knew the best way to deal with you after one too many drinks was to stay calm and hushed. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo! You broke my heart, Brie! You broke my heart.\u201d You couldn\u2019t tell, but you were shaking like there was no heat in the room. Before you got the chance to fall, Brie quickly wrapped her arms around you and pulled you against her body. The hug broke something inside you and you let out serval loud sobs. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI still love you.\u201d You managed to sob while nuzzling into Brie\u2019s chest. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI know. I love you too, baby.\u201d Brie gently rubbed small circles on your back while you continued to sob. It took a few minutes but you managed to calm yourself down. </i></p><p><i>\u201cLet\u2019s get you cleaned up and into bed, okay?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Brie helped you into the guest bathroom and turned on the shower for you. \u201cI\u2019m going to be right outside the door if you need me.\u201d She told you before closing the door, leaving you alone for the first time that night. The shower was a bit of a blur, figuratively and literally, but Brie was right there waiting for you with pajamas in her hands. </i></p><p><i>After you changed into the pajamas, which consisted of your shirt and Brie\u2019s sweat pants, you climbed into bed. Brie placed a trash can by the side of the bed and a water bottle on the night stand. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you going to sleep with me tonight?\u201d You asked, already feeling your eye lids get heavy. Brie shook her head as she sat down on the couch on the opposite side of the room. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to sleep on the couch in case you get sick.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I want you to sleep with me.\u201d Now you were pouting which made Brie crack a smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo you don\u2019t, y/n. You\u2019ll regret it in the morning.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I miss you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI miss you too, baby, but I know you\u2019ll be upset if we wake up together.\u201d You wanted to argue with that, but something inside you knew she was right. </i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay. Will you make me waffles tomorrow?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling up to it, yeah.\u201d Brie said with that adorable laugh you missed hearing. </i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay. Goodnight, Brie.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cGoodnight, y/n.\u201d </i></p><p>The next morning, you woke up feeling exhausted. Your head hurt and you felt like you\u2019d slept maybe an hour versus seven hours. After stretching, you sat up and were instantly hit with the memory of the previous night\u2019s events. </p><p>Drinking with your friends, publicly crying over Brie, getting kicked out of the bar for crying, taking an Uber to Brie\u2019s, and belligerently yelling at her. You felt a knot form in your stomach at the memories. She had been so good to you even though you screamed at her. </p><p>You climbed out of bed and tiptoed into the hallway. Soft music played as Brie fumbled around in the kitchen. When you rounded the corner, you saw Brie gently swaying to the music while frying bacon. You cleared your throat to get her attention. </p><p>\u201cGood morning. How are you feeling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cExhausted. Last night was&hellip;rough.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrust me, I know.\u201d She said with a small giggle. </p><p>\u201cI made you waffles if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d Brie nodded her head towards a small stack of waffles sitting on the kitchen island. </p><p>You weren\u2019t starving, but you didn\u2019t want the waffles go to waste. You took your usual seat at the island and started to pick at your breakfast. It took Brie a few minutes to finish her breakfast, but she eventually joined you while staying on the opposite side of the island. The scene felt safe and familiar to you, making it feel easy to talk to Brie instead of yelling. </p><p>\u201cBacon, huh?\u201d You asked because bacon was not apart of the Captain Marvel diet. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s cheat day.\u201d Almost instantly Brie realized what she said. Her head shot up and her eyes widened when she looked at you. </p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to say that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. As long as were apologizing, I\u2019m sorry for showing up and yelling at you last night.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, I deserved it. Plus, it was nice to see you again for the first time in two months, even if you were yelling at me.\u201d It was quiet for a few minutes before you spoke up. </p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about us, Brie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know we do.\u201d Brie hung her head low and pushed her breakfast away. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay together?\u201d You asked while shuffling pieces of food around the plate. </p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re the love of my life, y/n.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why did you cheat on me? I know you were upset about our fight, but why didn\u2019t you walk away if you loved me so much? Help me understand, Brie.\u201d You said, feeling proud that you could talk to her without getting upset or yelling.  </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know&hellip;I was really upset and felt like you cared about work more than me. We were fighting so much it felt like we were going to break up any second.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou could have talked to me about feeling this way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, I wasn\u2019t thinking. When I woke up the next morning, you were all I could think about.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf only you thought about me that night. Maybe we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, y/n. I\u2019ll do anything to prove how much I love you.\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything in response. You looked down at your plate and tried to process everything you were feeling. Ever since you found out about Brie cheating you were sure you wanted to break up. But hearing Brie say the things she was saying and seeing the remorse in her eyes was really making you rethink what you wanted. </p><p>\u201cY/n, do you still want to be together?\u201d You let out a sigh and looked up at Brie.  </p><p>\u201cYes, I still want to be with you.\u201d Brie\u2019s eyes lit up and she quickly ran over to you. Before she got the chance to wrap her arms around you, you placed a firm hand on her chest. </p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s going to take some time for us to get back to the way things used to be. I still don\u2019t feel like I can trust you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI understand. Thank you for giving us a second chance.\u201d Your girlfriend happily smiled at you, forcing you to also smile. You dropped your hand from Brie\u2019s chest as you stood up. Cautiously, you wrapped your arms around Brie and rested your head on her chest.</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d You mumbled as Brie held you close. </p><p>\u201cI missed you too, baby.\u201d The two of you stood in silence for a while, happy to be back together. You knew it would take a while before you could fully trust Brie and have your relationship return to normal, but you were excited to have the love of your life back. </p>",

Brie shook her head as she sat down on the couch on the opposite side of the room. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to sleep on the couch in case you get sick.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I want you to sleep with me.\u201d Now you were pouting which made Brie crack a smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo you don\u2019t, y/n. You\u2019ll regret it in the morning.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I miss you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI miss you too, baby, but I know you\u2019ll be upset if we wake up together.\u201d You wanted to argue with that, but something inside you knew she was right. </i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay. Will you make me waffles tomorrow?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling up to it, yeah.\u201d Brie said with that adorable laugh you missed hearing. </i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay. Goodnight, Brie.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cGoodnight, y/n.\u201d </i></p><p>The next morning, you woke up feeling exhausted. Your head hurt and you felt like you\u2019d slept maybe an hour versus seven hours. After stretching, you sat up and were instantly hit with the memory of the previous night\u2019s events. </p><p>Drinking with your friends, publicly crying over Brie, getting kicked out of the bar for crying, taking an Uber to Brie\u2019s, and belligerently yelling at her. You felt a knot form in your stomach at the memories. She had been so good to you even though you screamed at her. </p><p>You climbed out of bed and tiptoed into the hallway. Soft music played as Brie fumbled around in the kitchen. When you rounded the corner, you saw Brie gently swaying to the music while frying bacon. You cleared your throat to get her attention. </p><p>\u201cGood morning. How are you feeling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cExhausted. Last night was\u2026rough.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrust me, I know.\u201d She said with a small giggle. </p><p>\u201cI made you waffles if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d Brie nodded her head towards a small stack of waffles sitting on the kitchen island. </p><p>You weren\u2019t starving, but you didn\u2019t want the waffles go to waste. You took your usual seat at the island and started to pick at your breakfast. It took Brie a few minutes to finish her breakfast, but she eventually joined you while staying on the opposite side of the island. The scene felt safe and familiar to you, making it feel easy to talk to Brie instead of yelling. </p><p>\u201cBacon, huh?\u201d You asked because bacon was not apart of the Captain Marvel diet. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s cheat day.\u201d Almost instantly Brie realized what she said. Her head shot up and her eyes widened when she looked at you. </p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to say that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. As long as were apologizing, I\u2019m sorry for showing up and yelling at you last night.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, I deserved it. Plus, it was nice to see you again for the first time in two months, even if you were yelling at me.\u201d It was quiet for a few minutes before you spoke up. </p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about us, Brie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know we do.\u201d Brie hung her head low and pushed her breakfast away. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay together?\u201d You asked while shuffling pieces of food around the plate. </p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re the love of my life, y/n.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why did you cheat on me? I know you were upset about our fight, but why didn\u2019t you walk away if you loved me so much? Help me understand, Brie.\u201d You said, feeling proud that you could talk to her without getting upset or yelling.  </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026I was really upset and felt like you cared about work more than me. We were fighting so much it felt like we were going to break up any second.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou could have talked to me about feeling this way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, I wasn\u2019t thinking. When I woke up the next morning, you were all I could think about.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf only you thought about me that night. Maybe we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, y/n. I\u2019ll do anything to prove how much I love you.\u201d </p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything in response. You looked down at your plate and tried to process everything you were feeling. Ever since you found out about Brie cheating you were sure you wanted to break up. But hearing Brie say the things she was saying and seeing the remorse in her eyes was really making you rethink what you wanted. </p><p>\u201cY/n, do you still want to be together?\u201d You let out a sigh and looked up at Brie.  </p><p>\u201cYes, I still want to be with you.\u201d Brie\u2019s eyes lit up and she quickly ran over to you. Before she got the chance to wrap her arms around you, you placed a firm hand on her chest. </p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s going to take some time for us to get back to the way things used to be. I still don\u2019t feel like I can trust you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI understand. Thank you for giving us a second chance.\u201d Your girlfriend happily smiled at you, forcing you to also smile. You dropped your hand from Brie\u2019s chest as you stood up. Cautiously, you wrapped your arms around Brie and rested your head on her chest.</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d You mumbled as Brie held you close. </p><p>\u201cI missed you too, baby.\u201d The two of you stood in silence for a while, happy to be back together. You knew it would take a while before you could fully trust Brie and have your relationship return to normal, but you were excited to have the love of your life back. </p></p>",

I still don&rsquo;t feel like I can trust you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I understand. Thank you for giving us a second chance.&rdquo; Your girlfriend happily smiled at you, forcing you to also smile. You dropped your hand from Brie&rsquo;s chest as you stood up. Cautiously, you wrapped your arms around Brie and rested your head on her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo; You mumbled as Brie held you close. </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too, baby.&rdquo; The two of you stood in silence for a while, happy to be back together. You knew it would take a while before you could fully trust Brie and have your relationship return to normal, but you were excited to have the love of your life back. </p></p>",
