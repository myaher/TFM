Turning the page of his newspaper, he couldn\u2019t stop\nhimself from laughing: wearing the Saviour\u2019s colour has been the only logical\nchoice he made when he planned to meet the son of a Death Eater in King Cross. The\nAurors were patrolling everywhere, looking for allies of the Dark Wizard, and\nMuggle one has been given pictures of the fugitives. If he wasn\u2019t amongst them\nand came back to the house alive, then he would consider himself lucky.\nOtherwise, stupid would be perfectly suiting.</p><p>10h58.\nWith a deep breath, Blaise stood up and, checking conscientiously his\nsurroundings, stride toward platform 9<sup>&frac34;</sup>. \u00a0The entire plan was stupid. He didn\u2019t even\nknow if Theo had read his owl. Letters were still opened daily, and a coded one\ncould have been considered dubious. And even if he got it, who said he\u2019d be\ncoming? They had never been great friends. The risk was too high. Anyone could\nbe an Auror, or a muggle Auror. Who knew what does a muggle Auror looked like? </p><p>10h59.\nHe still had a few seconds. Breathing in and out, he pretended to lace his\nshoes, giving time for the weird looking guy to pass. </p><p>At\n11h, he had crossed the wall and stood alone on the platform. </p><p>\u201cShit\nshit shit\u2026\u201d he mumbled, searching for a hint of a human being. Theo wasn\u2019t\nthere. No one was there. He\u2019s been pathetic, thinking his plan has the smallest\nchance of succeed. <i>When the week is over</i>\ncould have meant Sunday and not Monday and <i>where\nit had all begun </i>how fucking precise! </p><p>At\n11h02, he decided that he would leave the station at 05. Here he was the\neasiest target of the whole United Kingdom. There were cameras everywhere in\nthe muggle part of the station; his beanie and an atrocious muggle jumper\nwouldn\u2019t be a sufficient disguise if the authorities were really working hand\nin hand to capture every witches and wizards suspected of being linked to\nVoldemort. And he was sure to be on the list. </p><p>11h03.\nHe shouldn\u2019t have stayed with Draco after he took the Mark. He shouldn\u2019t have\nstarted to talk to Theo when Draco did. He should have been there for Draco\nbefore he took the Mark in the first place. Should have forced him to leave his\nhome when his wonky father got out of Azkaban. Should have run away to France\nwhen Voldemort had return. Mistakes on mistakes, that\u2019s what he\u2019s done with his\nlast two years.</p><p>11h04.\nSomething caught his eyes. A raven had landed on the platform, eyeing him. Did\nraven could eye people? Clenching his fist, he took a deep breath and decided\nthat those last sixty seconds could get screwed.

The\nraven fell to the ground, petrified, soon followed by another, and a third one until\nall the birds were left lifeless. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d he asked himself in\nhorror as he finally lowered his wand. Around him, circling him, were dozen of raven,\ndraining from their blood. The fall has been lethal. He stumbled and felt his\nentire body react to the ferric smell filling his nostrils. He couldn\u2019t stay\nthere. The scattered feathers, the blood dripping on the ground, it was a\nslaughter. Feeling his stomach constrict again, he started running until he\ncrossed the wall. He had to get away from there as quickly as possible. He had\nto leave King Cross before anyone found out the mess he made. He had to be home\nwhen the entire Auror department would be deployed, looking for the dark wizard\nwho just performed a sinister ritual. He needed a plan. He needed to breathe.\nHe needed to puke. But a hand grabbed his arm and pulled him behind the pillar\nwith force before he could even try to steady himself. Panic invaded him as he\nfell his own body hit the bricks, suddenly blind to the world surrounding him. <i>It\u2019s over</i> he cannot helped fearing as a\nhand covered hastily his mouth. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><i><a href=\"https://sweetlialia.tumblr.com/post/180512982310/a-new-home-part-9\">Next part</a></i></p><hr><p>Thank\nyou for reading!

He should have been there for Draco\nbefore he took the Mark in the first place. Should have forced him to leave his\nhome when his wonky father got out of Azkaban. Should have run away to France\nwhen Voldemort had return. Mistakes on mistakes, that\u2019s what he\u2019s done with his\nlast two years.</p><p>11h04.\nSomething caught his eyes.

The Ministry fights within itself as Percy Weasley and Hermione Granger battle for the position of Minister of Magic, tearing the fabric holding wizarding society together. </small></p>\n<h2><i>see how fast they fall apart&hellip;<i></i></i></h2><p><small>\nWill you fight for what you believe, or take the path of least resistance?

Your final year at Hogwarts couldn\u2019t possibly be any stranger than the previous six&hellip;but seven is one of the most powerful numbers in magic, after all.</p><p>[ <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16475342/chapters/38583497\">AO3 Link</a> ]</p><p>\n\n<b>Author\u2019s Notes:</b> Co-written by Andrew. Follow the blog @ <a href=\"http://mahpiohanzia.tumblr.com\">http://mahpiohanzia.tumblr.com</a></p><p>\n\n<b>Notes: </b>what do you guys think so far?? please let me know!<br/></p><!-- more --><p>If you were asked to sum yourself up in a single word, that word would be \u2018tired\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>The final couple years\u2019 curriculum at Hogwarts was dedicated to preparing students for N.E.W.T.s at the end of their seventh year. Your workload for year six was overwhelming, and with graduation on the horizon, you had no reason to doubt year seven would be even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Your stellar academic performance so far was wholly attributed to hard work and sheer force of will&ndash;doubly so, as you entered the tail-end of your education. Within the past year, to keep up with the quality of your coursework, you\u2019d evolved into a hyper-focused, largely isolated monstrosity of a workaholic; you never considered yourself antisocial before, but there were only so many times you could turn down your roomates\u2019 invitations to hang out before they stopped asking altogether.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, you kept huddled against the window of your compartment, rain showering the glass as the constant rumble of the train rocked you to sleep. You were practically swaddled within your robes, having changed into your uniform early for the sole purpose of sleeping as much as you could on the way there.</p>\n\n<p>Although you\u2019d fallen asleep alone, by the time you reached Hogsmeade Station, you woke to the anxious chatter of fellow members from Slytherin house, who\u2019d used your colours as territorial claim to the train compartment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d squeaked a small second-year girl sitting across from you. \u201cThey\u2019re awake!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A young man with broad shoulders and fantastic hair looked over at you, concerned. \u201cDid you actually sleep through that whole thing? You weren\u2019t just faking?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t get much sleep last night,\u201d you lied, annoyed at having to explain yourself. You rubbed at your eyes beneath your glasses. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When the rest of the compartment exchanged wary glances, you realized at once that something was <em>very </em>wrong.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The enchanted ceiling showed a dark, muddied sky still recovering from the evening storm, as if the weather mirrored the dim atmosphere of the Great Hall. Beneath the light of a thousand flickering candles, the entire school sat in rapt attention during Dumbledore\u2019s announcements, with many of the younger years breaking into nervous discussion at the mention of dementors. In light of recent events, you were told, security at Hogwarts had been escalated, with the infamous wraiths of Azkaban now guarding every entrance to the grounds.</p>\n\n<p>When your housemates filled you in on the dementor-related mishap on the train, you were suddenly very glad to be a heavy sleeper.</p>\n\n<p>Shifting gears, Dumbledore went on to introduce the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor: a rather plain, shabby-looking gentleman who looked as if he hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in years. Even more surprising, however, was the retirement of Professor Kettleburn, and the appointment of Hagrid to the position of Care of Magical Creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone had taken Professor Kettleburn\u2019s class, but <em>everyone </em>knew Hagrid.</p>\n\n<p>After the last of the dessert disappeared and bedtime was finally called, you used the ensuing crowd as cover to approach the end of the staff table where Hagrid sat.</p>\n\n<p>You caught his eye, and offered a handshake. \u201cCongratulations, <em>Professor </em>Hagrid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used ter that!\u201d the large man bellowed, going red in the cheeks as his hands practically swallowed yours. \u201cAppreciate it, though&ndash;<em>really </em>lookin\u2019 forward ter it. Got some <em>great </em>lessons planned. Will I be seein\u2019 yeh there, erm&hellip;sorry, didn\u2019 catch yer name?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You reintroduced yourself. \u201cAnd no, unfortunately&ndash;I never got the O.W.L.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh, well&hellip;\u201d He hesitated for a moment, glancing at the green and silver of your robes, before shaking his shaggy head and waving a hand dismissively. \u201cNonsense&ndash;yeh ever wan\u2019 ter sit in on a lesson, yeh jus\u2019 let me know. I\u2019d be glad ter have yeh.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlanning extra lessons before receiving your timetable?\u201d came the stern voice of a familiar witch. \u201cQuite optimistic for a seventh-year.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hagrid straightened up like <em>he </em>was the one in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>An older woman stepped out from behind him, wearing dark green robes and a strict expression, her grey hair pulled into a tight bun beneath her pointed hat. Although never an unfair teacher, she exuded a presence that always made you feel like she\u2019d caught you in the act of doing something unsavoury&ndash;this would make you nervous, which would make her suspicious, which would toss you into an endless feedback loop of looking highly suspect over absolutely nothing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor McGonagall,\u201d you greeted with false cheer. \u201cHave a good summer?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Her intense gaze did not falter. \u201cDid you receive my note before the start of term?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI did, ma\u2019am, yes. Your office, Friday evening.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood. Now, enough dawdling&ndash;please make your way to the dormitories with the rest of your house.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You obliged, taking the excuse to break eye contact with her as you retreated from the staff table.</p>\n\n<p>You glanced a goodbye at Hagrid, who mouthed \u2018Let me know\u2019 and gave you a thumbs up as you left.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<center><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1030\" data-orig-width=\"1498\" data-orig-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f3758244fda50859cf353db60af0cf3/tumblr_inline_pioyxagRYO1qc1gpe_540.png\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-height=\"1030\" data-orig-width=\"1498\" data-orig-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\"/></figure></center>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\">[ Image Full View ]</a></center>\n\n<p>Save for some minor changes, your timetable was the same as that of your previous year. The large amount of free periods once gave you the misconception of free time, back when you were na\u00efve to the ways of the world, but after the near-daily ten-hour study sessions of your sixth year, you knew better than to fall for <em>that </em>illusion again.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping time would be important this year, so you\u2019d bought a watch over the summer&ndash;simple and black, with silver embellishments. The watch itself was charmed to zap you with a small electric shock at set times throughout the day. You enchanted it with your school schedule.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for the first few weeks of term to be punctuated with various mishaps that spread around the school like wildfire. Draco Malfoy, the pompous third-year son of a powerful political figure, managed to get himself injured the first day of classes, and rumour had it he was milking it for all it was worth.</p>\n\n<p>You never subscribed to pure-blood elitism or discrimination, nor did the majority of your house&ndash;more than half of the entire Hogwarts student body was half-blood or Muggleborn, after all, Slytherin population included. Yet, it was people <em>like </em>Malfoy who reminded you that the loudest, most obnoxious members of any group were the ones responsible for its reputation, and whenever you caught the pathetic thirteen-year-old boy strutting through the halls, retelling the increasingly outlandish tale of how he almost lost his arm to a rabid Hippogriff, you couldn\u2019t help but feel deep embarrassment for your house.</p>\n\n<p>There was little time to dwell, however.</p>\n\n<p>Seventh-year N.E.W.T. courses featured advanced-level magic with smaller, mixed-house classes, meaning much stronger individual attention and higher workloads. Two days into term and the assigned readings were already threatening to consume your entire weekend, and the only reason you wanted Friday to be over was to get a headstart on Monday\u2019s assignments.</p>\n\n<p>Your last class of the week was your first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, and somehow, Professor Lupin looked even <em>worse </em>than he did at the start-of-term feast.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you were only a few feet away from him, you learned he was a taller man, his tousled brown hair salted with touches of grey far beyond his years. He wore clothes a half-size too large for his frame; the fabric of his cardigan was pilling at the edges, and his robes had clearly been darned in several places. It was a good thing none of the classroom windows were open, you thought to yourself, as a stiff breeze would\u2019ve been sure to knock him over.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood afternoon, class,\u201d he began, his voice much stronger than his posture. \u201cMy name is R.J. Lupin, and I have the honour of being your Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher this term. You may call me \u2018Professor.\u2019 I assure you I have been called worse things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The class gave a small laugh.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, in an attempt to establish myself as your favourite teacher <em>right </em>at the start of term, I will be administering a test for our very first class.\u201d There was a collective sigh, but Lupin was already raising a hand to placate the room. \u201cNot to worry, not to worry&ndash;this won\u2019t be graded. It\u2019s just a little something to gauge the level of your study progress. I\u2019ve come to understand that your sixth-year N.E.W.T. lessons were rather&hellip;inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Lockhart was a quack,\u201d shouted a voice from the back row. Sounds of agreement and jeering filled the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll the more reason for this test,\u201d he said. \u201cYour N.E.W.T.s are at the end of this year, and if I am to prepare you for them, I must learn <em>exactly </em>what you don\u2019t know.\u201d He took his wand from his inner pocket and gave it a wave. From a large stack on his desk, folded sheets of parchment distributed themselves around the class. \u201cAgain, this is <em>not </em>being marked&ndash;answer what you can, leave blank what you cannot. You have thirty minutes. Begin.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You unfolded the parchment in front of you, dipped your quill into your inkwell, and set to work.</p>\n\n<p>The exam began with simple questions that could be answered in a few words or less, about dark magical creatures, general defensive spell knowledge, and various incantations. As you progressed through the parchment, however, the questions grew more complicated; there were sections in which to illustrate differences between mirrored and non-mirrored wand movements, the most efficient methods of spell-chaining, and questions regarding counterspell theories you only vaguely remembered reading about. As instructed, you began skipping questions you didn\u2019t know the answer to, until you reached the end and realized in a heart-sinking panic that nearly half of your test was blank.</p>\n\n<p>All too quickly, Lupin called time, and with another wave of his wand, gathered the papers back to his desk. As your half-empty parchment slid away, you immediately glanced around the room to gauge overall impressions of the exam; thankfully, at least you weren\u2019t the <em>only </em>one looking bewildered.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood, good&ndash;thank you, this will be very helpful.\u201d Lupin arranged the completed exams back into a neat pile on his desk. \u201cAs I\u2019ll need some time to get up to speed, I will <em>not </em>be assigning any homework this weekend&ndash;however, I <em>would </em>like to finish today\u2019s class with a bit of a practical test. Everyone, put away your things and pair up, please, facing one another.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As everyone packed up and got to their feet, Lupin moved the rows of desks up against the walls, clearing enough room on the floor for two lines of students. By process of elimination, you ended up pairing against a familiar, burly seventh-year with short hair and a strong jawline&ndash;the infamously tenacious Quidditch Captain of the Gryffindor team, Oliver Wood.</p>\n\n<p>Wood pursed his lips and gave you a polite smile. You returned it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, get out your wands,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI\u2019d like to measure your proficiency with nonverbal spellwork. Should be very straightforward.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You pulled out your wand from your inner robe pocket: a jet-black length of carved wood, the edges where your fingers rested worn to a dark grey. Nonverbal spells were a well-practiced skill learned at the beginning of your previous year&ndash;even if Lockhart didn\u2019t teach them, <em>every </em>spell learned across classes during your sixth year was expected to be performed without speaking.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThose on my right,\u201d Lupin called out, raising a hand to indicate the row, \u201cwill cast a Stunning Spell on their opponent without speaking, on my mark. Those on my left will cast a Shield Charm in return, <em>also </em>without speaking. For those casting Shield Charms, please <em>dissipate </em>the Stun instead of <em>deflecting </em>it&ndash;I\u2019d appreciate keeping my classroom intact, if possible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The students in your row would be performing first.</p>\n\n<p>You made eye contact with Wood and nodded, making sure he was ready. He nodded back.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWands at the ready, very good. Three, two, one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>With a sharp flick of your wrist, you cast a Stunning Spell in Wood\u2019s direction. A burst of red light shot from the end of your wand. Wood shielded himself against it easily, dissipating your spell into a small wisp of red smoke. All your neighbors shared identical results.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cLet\u2019s switch, now, wands at the ready. Three, two, one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mirroring the rest of the students in his row, Wood raised his wand at you, and cast the spell.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until the jet of red light sped towards you when you realized you\u2019d forgotten the Shield Charm incantation completely.</p>\n\n<p>Muscle memory alone drew your wand in front of you with the correct motion, but without the proper incantation to go with it, the Stun ricocheted off the end of your wand&ndash;and straight into your own face.</p>\n\n<p>You were on your back in an instant, halfway across the classroom floor.</p>\n\n<p>Gasps of shocked laughter accompanied the loud, painful ringing in your ears. Somewhere in the distance, you could hear Wood apologizing like mad.</p>\n\n<p>The ceiling of the classroom spun and blurred into your vision. Your eyes were stinging, and you were trying to will them <em>not </em>to water up, if only to save what little dignity you had left&ndash;you weren\u2019t <em>actually </em>crying, you were experiencing that awful, biting, welling reflex of getting hit hard in the face, but you knew there was no difference to the outside eye.</p>\n\n<p>You tasted copper in the back of your throat long before you realized your nose was bleeding.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, there were a pair of hands on you&ndash;someone was guiding you to your feet, hooking one of your arms around their shoulders to help you walk.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cClass dismissed,\u201d Lupin said abruptly, leading you from the room.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>The first week of term was typically the busiest for Madam Pomfrey, and today was no exception. By the sound of it, she had her hands full tending to several first-years who, on a dare from a rival house, ignored instructions during Herbology and were now paying a painful, swollen price for it.</p>\n\n<p>You sat in silence in the Hospital Wing lobby, one hand still wrapped tightly around your wand, the other holding your sleeve against your nose to stifle the bleeding. Your face was burning&ndash;partly from the pain, partly from the sheer embarrassment of having a <em>teacher </em>waiting there with you in the neighboring seat.</p>\n\n<p>More than anything, you wished Lupin would\u2019ve just left you there to stew in peace, but the man seemed dead-set on doing the exact opposite. He\u2019d helped you to the Hospital Wing, after all&ndash;there was no polite way of asking him to leave.</p>\n\n<p>There was also no <em>polite </em>way of holding back the frustration bubbling inside you, either, so after several minutes of idle silence, you stopped trying.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Protego </em>,\u201d you snarled. The injury dulled your syllables, like you had a stuffy nose. \u201cThe incantation is <em>Protego </em>. That\u2019s <em>fourth-year </em>stuff, for Merlin\u2019s sake&ndash;how am I supposed to pass my N.E.W.T.s if I can\u2019t remember <em>Protego </em>?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d he said, softly. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for doing a practical test without having a proper understanding of everyone\u2019s abilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know the spell,\u201d you snapped. \u201cI just&ndash;\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c&ndash;haven\u2019t used it in a long time, I understand. But this could\u2019ve been avoided if I simply had everyone recite the spells before we began casting them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, this could\u2019ve been <em>avoided </em>if I just remembered the bloody spell. I was the only one in the class who forgot it, this is on me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn oversight on both our parts, then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His tone sounded final, and you bit back the urge to argue. You weren\u2019t sure why he was being so understanding about this whole thing, but you knew you\u2019d be a fool to challenge it.</p>\n\n<p>With one part of your robe sleeve thoroughly soaked with blood, you made a disgusted noise as you folded over a dry part of the fabric and pressed your leaking nose to it. \u201cS\u2019pose I won\u2019t be gracing the cover of the Daily Prophet any time soon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Lupin leaned over in his chair and looked at you, reacquainting himself with your injury. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d he assured. \u201cWhen I was your age, I fumbled a fairly standard Conjuring Spell during class. I learned two things that day: that enunciation is <em>vital </em>, even if it\u2019s just in your head&ndash;and that birds like to go for the eyes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You gave a snort of laughter, then an immediate curse of pain as it reminded you that your nose was broken.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, sounding more amused than sincere.</p>\n\n<p>You shrugged it off. \u201cDid that really happen?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFeel free to ask Professor McGonagall yourself. Definitely wasn\u2019t one of my <em>proudest </em>exams.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d You dangled the wand in your other hand in a hopeless sort of motion. \u201cThis isn\u2019t one of my proudest days, either.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the antique you have there,\u201d he said, motioning towards your wand. \u201cEbony?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d You looked it over. Did he just call your wand <em>old </em>? \u201cMy grandfather left it to me. Phoenix feather cores are rather rare&ndash;I guess he reckoned I could squeeze another lifetime out of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You shrugged, sliding the wand back into your inner robe pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I guess. A little temperamental. It, uh.\u201d You clicked your tongue and motioned to your face. \u201cDoesn\u2019t like unclear instructions.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He leaned in for a whisper. \u201cIn its defence, I doubt many of us do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Remembering not to laugh, you instead smiled into your sleeve.</p>\n\n<p>Without warning, Madam Pomfrey swept into the lobby, her stark-white robes billowing behind her as she towered over your seated form. She moved your arm from your nose, holding your chin and tilting your face from side to side as if she were examining a particularly interesting fruit. \u201cAnd what have we here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA rebounded Stunning Spell,\u201d said Lupin.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBroken nose and a black eye, easy fix.\u201d She turned heel and made her way back into the main ward. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Now that you were being looked after, Lupin got to his feet and prepared to leave before Madam Pomfrey managed to shoo him away, grabbing his robe from the back of his chair and folding it over his forearm. Your conversation had made you feel so at ease that you\u2019d forgotten to be embarrassed he was still there.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d He reached into the pocket of his cardigan and pulled out your pair of broken glasses.</p>\n\n<p>(No wonder everything was still blurry.)</p>\n\n<p>Lupin tapped on your glasses with his wand, repairing them at once. Before you could say anything, he\u2019d leaned over and slid them carefully back onto your face, minding your injury; his fingers brushed against your cheeks as your vision became clear, and his face was just close enough for you to learn his eyes were green.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere we are,\u201d he smiled. \u201cJust like new.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You mumbled a small \u2018thanks\u2019 as he straightened back up to full height.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight, then. See you Monday.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You stared after him while he left, at least until the sudden, unexpected pain of Madam Pomfrey\u2019s spell snapped both you and your nose back to reality.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p><em>The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 7 </em>was propped open in front of you during dinner that evening.</p>\n\n<p>Though you were only two days into term, N.E.W.T. preparations were fully underway, starting with condensed reviews of nearly every spell, potion, and number chart you encountered throughout your first six years. Though Lupin hadn\u2019t assigned any homework, you wanted to get a head start on reviewing your old Defence Against the Dark Arts notes to prevent any repeat incidents involving embarrassingly basic spells. You <em>also </em>had a one-on-one meeting with McGonagall later that evening.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of having more than dinner on your plate that night, your attention constantly drifted towards the only empty seat at the staff table.</p>\n\n<p>Lupin wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere between the fifth and tenth glances at the staff table, your book slipped out of your hand, and page 24 received a healthy serving of gravy.</p>\n\n<p>You decided you were being ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>You would pay his office a visit and dispel the day\u2019s awkwardness before your next lesson, if only to prevent making a complete ass of yourself two Defence Against the Dark Arts classes in a row.</p>\n\n<p>After dinner, you made your way up to the second-floor corridor, mentally rehearsing bullet points of conversation on the way. You were going to apologize for causing a scene in his class earlier that afternoon. You would thank him for his help getting you to the Hospital Wing. You would promise to do better in his class. That was all. Simple and clearcut.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, just to clear the air.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a deep breath, you knocked on his office door.</p>\n\n<p>There was no answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor?\u201d you called. Maybe he\u2019d already retired to his living quarters for the night&ndash;he certainly didn\u2019t look well earlier in class.</p>\n\n<p>However, as you knocked again, you noticed the doors to his office were locked&ndash;not just fastened shut, but <em>magically sealed </em>.</p>\n\n<p>Behind you, a sharp voice spat out your last name.</p>\n\n<p>The call gave you a start.</p>\n\n<p>Be it due to your gross lack of awareness or his unspoken mastery of stealth, Snape had managed to make it all the way down the second-floor hallway without you noticing his approach.</p>\n\n<p>Snape looked down his nose at you, his gaze cold and unblinking. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Your first instinct was to lie, but your second instinct thought better of it. \u201cI&hellip;caused a disruption in Professor Lupin\u2019s class earlier today.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You swallowed. Of course he would\u2019ve heard. \u201cYeah, so&hellip;I came to apologize.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe most sincere apology,\u201d he started, raising a brow, \u201cwould be to simply <em>improve </em>your behaviour in class going forward, would it not?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure we were on good terms.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wrong answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFive points from Slytherin.\u201d The corner of Snape\u2019s nose curled, as if he suddenly smelled something foul. \u201cWe do not <em>grovel </em>for forgiveness in this house. You would do well to remember that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You bit your tongue. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, unless I\u2019m mistaken, you have a meeting to attend.\u201d He stepped aside without looking at you, making a path for you to pass by. \u201cIf you are late, I will know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As if on cue, your watch gave you a small <em>bzzt </em>on the wrist, marking your fifteen-minute warning.</p>\n\n<p>You mumbled a final, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d before passing him on your way back down the corridor.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>Out of everything you would have to face this year, you thought you were looking <em>forward </em>the completion of your Animagus training.</p>\n\n<p>Like everyone else, you first learned about Animagi in Transfiguration class during your third year. When asked about the process to become one, however, McGonagall was quick to inform you that it was an extremely rare skill not to be studied lightly; being an Animagus trained under Dumbledore himself, McGonagall wouldn\u2019t consider taking in any candidate who proved themselves anything short of outstanding in her field.</p>\n\n<p>This meant achieving top grades in both Transfiguration class and the mounds of prerequisite extracurricular homework she assigned you&ndash;term after term, year after year&ndash;just to convince her you were worthy of her time.</p>\n\n<p>This meant keeping your head down and not giving Snape, as your head of house, any excuse to deny you permission to pursue the additional line of study.</p>\n\n<p>This meant getting an Outstanding in <em>both </em>your Transfiguration <em>and </em>Potions O.W.L.s to qualify for private lessons with McGonagall throughout your sixth year.</p>\n\n<p>Becoming an Animagus was, above all else, an extremely <em>bizarre </em>goal&ndash;a complex, demanding, high-risk process to endure for the acquisition of an esoteric skill with little to no practical use. One\u2019s efforts were much better spent in something more valuable, practical, and marketable&ndash;but that was <em>why </em>you wanted to do it.</p>\n\n<p>The journey was for you and you alone, just to prove you could make it.</p>\n\n<p>At least, that\u2019s what you thought.</p>\n\n<p>McGonagall sat silent behind her desk, leaning forward as she kept her hands folded in front of her. She stared at you over the rim of her glasses, studying your pale expression, while your eyes remained fixated on the small crystal phial sitting on the desk between the two of you.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you going to be sick?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d you croaked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI urge you to do it away from my desk, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You gave a nervous laugh, though your eyes didn\u2019t move from the phial.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can revisit this next month if you\u2019re having doubts,\u201d she suggested, a bristle of impatience in her voice.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo doubts,\u201d you replied. \u201cJust nerves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d Her intensity eased, just a little. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been studying for this for almost four years,\u201d you said. \u201cIt always seemed so far away. \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus unless I get good marks on this assignment.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus unless I get perfect O.W.L.s.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus until I qualify for registration in year seven.\u2019 But <em>now </em>.\u201d You breathed another small laugh. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got the Mandrake leaf sitting right in front of me and I\u2019m <em>terrified </em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs you should be.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You tore your eyes from the phial and looked up at her, surprised.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe successful completion of the final Animagus ritual is one of the most daunting feats in the field of Transfiguration,\u201d she said, quite severely. \u201cThe slightest misstep <em>will </em>have disastrous results&ndash;permanent disfiguration at best, and at <em>worst </em>&hellip;well. Let\u2019s just say St. Mungo\u2019s has a long-term residents ward for a reason. You\u2019d be a fool <em>not </em>to be terrified.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor&ndash;\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat being said,\u201d she continued, raising a finger to quiet you. \u201cThe <em>reason </em>this process is so involved is because it is meant to teach you the virtues of <em>knowledge </em>and <em>patience </em>. You may not find day-to-day use in becoming an Animagus, but having studied the skill <em>successfully </em>these past few years has given you a framework of discipline that you will carry with you for the rest of your life.

Your workload for year six was overwhelming, and with graduation on the horizon, you had no reason to doubt year seven would be even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Your stellar academic performance so far was wholly attributed to hard work and sheer force of will\u2013doubly so, as you entered the tail-end of your education. Within the past year, to keep up with the quality of your coursework, you\u2019d evolved into a hyper-focused, largely isolated monstrosity of a workaholic; you never considered yourself antisocial before, but there were only so many times you could turn down your roomates\u2019 invitations to hang out before they stopped asking altogether.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, you kept huddled against the window of your compartment, rain showering the glass as the constant rumble of the train rocked you to sleep. You were practically swaddled within your robes, having changed into your uniform early for the sole purpose of sleeping as much as you could on the way there.</p>\n\n<p>Although you\u2019d fallen asleep alone, by the time you reached Hogsmeade Station, you woke to the anxious chatter of fellow members from Slytherin house, who\u2019d used your colours as territorial claim to the train compartment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d squeaked a small second-year girl sitting across from you. \u201cThey\u2019re awake!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A young man with broad shoulders and fantastic hair looked over at you, concerned. \u201cDid you actually sleep through that whole thing? You weren\u2019t just faking?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t get much sleep last night,\u201d you lied, annoyed at having to explain yourself. You rubbed at your eyes beneath your glasses. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When the rest of the compartment exchanged wary glances, you realized at once that something was <em>very </em>wrong.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The enchanted ceiling showed a dark, muddied sky still recovering from the evening storm, as if the weather mirrored the dim atmosphere of the Great Hall. Beneath the light of a thousand flickering candles, the entire school sat in rapt attention during Dumbledore\u2019s announcements, with many of the younger years breaking into nervous discussion at the mention of dementors. In light of recent events, you were told, security at Hogwarts had been escalated, with the infamous wraiths of Azkaban now guarding every entrance to the grounds.</p>\n\n<p>When your housemates filled you in on the dementor-related mishap on the train, you were suddenly very glad to be a heavy sleeper.</p>\n\n<p>Shifting gears, Dumbledore went on to introduce the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor: a rather plain, shabby-looking gentleman who looked as if he hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in years. Even more surprising, however, was the retirement of Professor Kettleburn, and the appointment of Hagrid to the position of Care of Magical Creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone had taken Professor Kettleburn\u2019s class, but <em>everyone </em>knew Hagrid.</p>\n\n<p>After the last of the dessert disappeared and bedtime was finally called, you used the ensuing crowd as cover to approach the end of the staff table where Hagrid sat.</p>\n\n<p>You caught his eye, and offered a handshake. \u201cCongratulations, <em>Professor </em>Hagrid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used ter that!\u201d the large man bellowed, going red in the cheeks as his hands practically swallowed yours. \u201cAppreciate it, though\u2013<em>really </em>lookin\u2019 forward ter it. Got some <em>great </em>lessons planned. Will I be seein\u2019 yeh there, erm\u2026sorry, didn\u2019 catch yer name?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You reintroduced yourself. \u201cAnd no, unfortunately\u2013I never got the O.W.L.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh, well\u2026\u201d He hesitated for a moment, glancing at the green and silver of your robes, before shaking his shaggy head and waving a hand dismissively. \u201cNonsense\u2013yeh ever wan\u2019 ter sit in on a lesson, yeh jus\u2019 let me know. I\u2019d be glad ter have yeh.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlanning extra lessons before receiving your timetable?\u201d came the stern voice of a familiar witch. \u201cQuite optimistic for a seventh-year.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hagrid straightened up like <em>he </em>was the one in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>An older woman stepped out from behind him, wearing dark green robes and a strict expression, her grey hair pulled into a tight bun beneath her pointed hat. Although never an unfair teacher, she exuded a presence that always made you feel like she\u2019d caught you in the act of doing something unsavoury\u2013this would make you nervous, which would make her suspicious, which would toss you into an endless feedback loop of looking highly suspect over absolutely nothing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor McGonagall,\u201d you greeted with false cheer. \u201cHave a good summer?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Her intense gaze did not falter. \u201cDid you receive my note before the start of term?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI did, ma\u2019am, yes. Your office, Friday evening.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood. Now, enough dawdling\u2013please make your way to the dormitories with the rest of your house.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You obliged, taking the excuse to break eye contact with her as you retreated from the staff table.</p>\n\n<p>You glanced a goodbye at Hagrid, who mouthed \u2018Let me know\u2019 and gave you a thumbs up as you left.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<center><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1030\" data-orig-width=\"1498\" data-orig-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f3758244fda50859cf353db60af0cf3/tumblr_inline_pioyxagRYO1qc1gpe_540.png\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-height=\"1030\" data-orig-width=\"1498\" data-orig-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\"></figure></center>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\">[ Image Full View ]</a></center>\n\n<p>Save for some minor changes, your timetable was the same as that of your previous year. The large amount of free periods once gave you the misconception of free time, back when you were na\u00efve to the ways of the world, but after the near-daily ten-hour study sessions of your sixth year, you knew better than to fall for <em>that </em>illusion again.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping time would be important this year, so you\u2019d bought a watch over the summer\u2013simple and black, with silver embellishments. The watch itself was charmed to zap you with a small electric shock at set times throughout the day. You enchanted it with your school schedule.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for the first few weeks of term to be punctuated with various mishaps that spread around the school like wildfire. Draco Malfoy, the pompous third-year son of a powerful political figure, managed to get himself injured the first day of classes, and rumour had it he was milking it for all it was worth.</p>\n\n<p>You never subscribed to pure-blood elitism or discrimination, nor did the majority of your house\u2013more than half of the entire Hogwarts student body was half-blood or Muggleborn, after all, Slytherin population included. Yet, it was people <em>like </em>Malfoy who reminded you that the loudest, most obnoxious members of any group were the ones responsible for its reputation, and whenever you caught the pathetic thirteen-year-old boy strutting through the halls, retelling the increasingly outlandish tale of how he almost lost his arm to a rabid Hippogriff, you couldn\u2019t help but feel deep embarrassment for your house.</p>\n\n<p>There was little time to dwell, however.</p>\n\n<p>Seventh-year N.E.W.T. courses featured advanced-level magic with smaller, mixed-house classes, meaning much stronger individual attention and higher workloads. Two days into term and the assigned readings were already threatening to consume your entire weekend, and the only reason you wanted Friday to be over was to get a headstart on Monday\u2019s assignments.</p>\n\n<p>Your last class of the week was your first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, and somehow, Professor Lupin looked even <em>worse </em>than he did at the start-of-term feast.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you were only a few feet away from him, you learned he was a taller man, his tousled brown hair salted with touches of grey far beyond his years. He wore clothes a half-size too large for his frame; the fabric of his cardigan was pilling at the edges, and his robes had clearly been darned in several places. It was a good thing none of the classroom windows were open, you thought to yourself, as a stiff breeze would\u2019ve been sure to knock him over.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood afternoon, class,\u201d he began, his voice much stronger than his posture. \u201cMy name is R.J. Lupin, and I have the honour of being your Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher this term. You may call me \u2018Professor.\u2019 I assure you I have been called worse things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The class gave a small laugh.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, in an attempt to establish myself as your favourite teacher <em>right </em>at the start of term, I will be administering a test for our very first class.\u201d There was a collective sigh, but Lupin was already raising a hand to placate the room. \u201cNot to worry, not to worry\u2013this won\u2019t be graded. It\u2019s just a little something to gauge the level of your study progress. I\u2019ve come to understand that your sixth-year N.E.W.T. lessons were rather\u2026inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Lockhart was a quack,\u201d shouted a voice from the back row. Sounds of agreement and jeering filled the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll the more reason for this test,\u201d he said. \u201cYour N.E.W.T.s are at the end of this year, and if I am to prepare you for them, I must learn <em>exactly </em>what you don\u2019t know.\u201d He took his wand from his inner pocket and gave it a wave. From a large stack on his desk, folded sheets of parchment distributed themselves around the class. \u201cAgain, this is <em>not </em>being marked\u2013answer what you can, leave blank what you cannot. You have thirty minutes. Begin.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You unfolded the parchment in front of you, dipped your quill into your inkwell, and set to work.</p>\n\n<p>The exam began with simple questions that could be answered in a few words or less, about dark magical creatures, general defensive spell knowledge, and various incantations. As you progressed through the parchment, however, the questions grew more complicated; there were sections in which to illustrate differences between mirrored and non-mirrored wand movements, the most efficient methods of spell-chaining, and questions regarding counterspell theories you only vaguely remembered reading about. As instructed, you began skipping questions you didn\u2019t know the answer to, until you reached the end and realized in a heart-sinking panic that nearly half of your test was blank.</p>\n\n<p>All too quickly, Lupin called time, and with another wave of his wand, gathered the papers back to his desk. As your half-empty parchment slid away, you immediately glanced around the room to gauge overall impressions of the exam; thankfully, at least you weren\u2019t the <em>only </em>one looking bewildered.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood, good\u2013thank you, this will be very helpful.\u201d Lupin arranged the completed exams back into a neat pile on his desk. \u201cAs I\u2019ll need some time to get up to speed, I will <em>not </em>be assigning any homework this weekend\u2013however, I <em>would </em>like to finish today\u2019s class with a bit of a practical test. Everyone, put away your things and pair up, please, facing one another.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As everyone packed up and got to their feet, Lupin moved the rows of desks up against the walls, clearing enough room on the floor for two lines of students. By process of elimination, you ended up pairing against a familiar, burly seventh-year with short hair and a strong jawline\u2013the infamously tenacious Quidditch Captain of the Gryffindor team, Oliver Wood.</p>\n\n<p>Wood pursed his lips and gave you a polite smile. You returned it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, get out your wands,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI\u2019d like to measure your proficiency with nonverbal spellwork. Should be very straightforward.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You pulled out your wand from your inner robe pocket: a jet-black length of carved wood, the edges where your fingers rested worn to a dark grey. Nonverbal spells were a well-practiced skill learned at the beginning of your previous year\u2013even if Lockhart didn\u2019t teach them, <em>every </em>spell learned across classes during your sixth year was expected to be performed without speaking.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThose on my right,\u201d Lupin called out, raising a hand to indicate the row, \u201cwill cast a Stunning Spell on their opponent without speaking, on my mark. Those on my left will cast a Shield Charm in return, <em>also </em>without speaking. For those casting Shield Charms, please <em>dissipate </em>the Stun instead of <em>deflecting </em>it\u2013I\u2019d appreciate keeping my classroom intact, if possible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The students in your row would be performing first.</p>\n\n<p>You made eye contact with Wood and nodded, making sure he was ready. He nodded back.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWands at the ready, very good. Three, two, one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>With a sharp flick of your wrist, you cast a Stunning Spell in Wood\u2019s direction. A burst of red light shot from the end of your wand. Wood shielded himself against it easily, dissipating your spell into a small wisp of red smoke. All your neighbors shared identical results.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cLet\u2019s switch, now, wands at the ready. Three, two, one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mirroring the rest of the students in his row, Wood raised his wand at you, and cast the spell.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until the jet of red light sped towards you when you realized you\u2019d forgotten the Shield Charm incantation completely.</p>\n\n<p>Muscle memory alone drew your wand in front of you with the correct motion, but without the proper incantation to go with it, the Stun ricocheted off the end of your wand\u2013and straight into your own face.</p>\n\n<p>You were on your back in an instant, halfway across the classroom floor.</p>\n\n<p>Gasps of shocked laughter accompanied the loud, painful ringing in your ears. Somewhere in the distance, you could hear Wood apologizing like mad.</p>\n\n<p>The ceiling of the classroom spun and blurred into your vision. Your eyes were stinging, and you were trying to will them <em>not </em>to water up, if only to save what little dignity you had left\u2013you weren\u2019t <em>actually </em>crying, you were experiencing that awful, biting, welling reflex of getting hit hard in the face, but you knew there was no difference to the outside eye.</p>\n\n<p>You tasted copper in the back of your throat long before you realized your nose was bleeding.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, there were a pair of hands on you\u2013someone was guiding you to your feet, hooking one of your arms around their shoulders to help you walk.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cClass dismissed,\u201d Lupin said abruptly, leading you from the room.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>The first week of term was typically the busiest for Madam Pomfrey, and today was no exception. By the sound of it, she had her hands full tending to several first-years who, on a dare from a rival house, ignored instructions during Herbology and were now paying a painful, swollen price for it.</p>\n\n<p>You sat in silence in the Hospital Wing lobby, one hand still wrapped tightly around your wand, the other holding your sleeve against your nose to stifle the bleeding. Your face was burning\u2013partly from the pain, partly from the sheer embarrassment of having a <em>teacher </em>waiting there with you in the neighboring seat.</p>\n\n<p>More than anything, you wished Lupin would\u2019ve just left you there to stew in peace, but the man seemed dead-set on doing the exact opposite. He\u2019d helped you to the Hospital Wing, after all\u2013there was no polite way of asking him to leave.</p>\n\n<p>There was also no <em>polite </em>way of holding back the frustration bubbling inside you, either, so after several minutes of idle silence, you stopped trying.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Protego </em>,\u201d you snarled. The injury dulled your syllables, like you had a stuffy nose. \u201cThe incantation is <em>Protego </em>. That\u2019s <em>fourth-year </em>stuff, for Merlin\u2019s sake\u2013how am I supposed to pass my N.E.W.T.s if I can\u2019t remember <em>Protego </em>?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d he said, softly. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for doing a practical test without having a proper understanding of everyone\u2019s abilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know the spell,\u201d you snapped. \u201cI just\u2013\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2013haven\u2019t used it in a long time, I understand. But this could\u2019ve been avoided if I simply had everyone recite the spells before we began casting them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, this could\u2019ve been <em>avoided </em>if I just remembered the bloody spell. I was the only one in the class who forgot it, this is on me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn oversight on both our parts, then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His tone sounded final, and you bit back the urge to argue. You weren\u2019t sure why he was being so understanding about this whole thing, but you knew you\u2019d be a fool to challenge it.</p>\n\n<p>With one part of your robe sleeve thoroughly soaked with blood, you made a disgusted noise as you folded over a dry part of the fabric and pressed your leaking nose to it. \u201cS\u2019pose I won\u2019t be gracing the cover of the Daily Prophet any time soon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Lupin leaned over in his chair and looked at you, reacquainting himself with your injury. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d he assured. \u201cWhen I was your age, I fumbled a fairly standard Conjuring Spell during class. I learned two things that day: that enunciation is <em>vital </em>, even if it\u2019s just in your head\u2013and that birds like to go for the eyes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You gave a snort of laughter, then an immediate curse of pain as it reminded you that your nose was broken.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, sounding more amused than sincere.</p>\n\n<p>You shrugged it off. \u201cDid that really happen?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFeel free to ask Professor McGonagall yourself. Definitely wasn\u2019t one of my <em>proudest </em>exams.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d You dangled the wand in your other hand in a hopeless sort of motion. \u201cThis isn\u2019t one of my proudest days, either.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the antique you have there,\u201d he said, motioning towards your wand. \u201cEbony?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d You looked it over. Did he just call your wand <em>old </em>? \u201cMy grandfather left it to me. Phoenix feather cores are rather rare\u2013I guess he reckoned I could squeeze another lifetime out of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You shrugged, sliding the wand back into your inner robe pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I guess. A little temperamental. It, uh.\u201d You clicked your tongue and motioned to your face. \u201cDoesn\u2019t like unclear instructions.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He leaned in for a whisper. \u201cIn its defence, I doubt many of us do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Remembering not to laugh, you instead smiled into your sleeve.</p>\n\n<p>Without warning, Madam Pomfrey swept into the lobby, her stark-white robes billowing behind her as she towered over your seated form. She moved your arm from your nose, holding your chin and tilting your face from side to side as if she were examining a particularly interesting fruit. \u201cAnd what have we here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA rebounded Stunning Spell,\u201d said Lupin.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBroken nose and a black eye, easy fix.\u201d She turned heel and made her way back into the main ward. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Now that you were being looked after, Lupin got to his feet and prepared to leave before Madam Pomfrey managed to shoo him away, grabbing his robe from the back of his chair and folding it over his forearm. Your conversation had made you feel so at ease that you\u2019d forgotten to be embarrassed he was still there.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d He reached into the pocket of his cardigan and pulled out your pair of broken glasses.</p>\n\n<p>(No wonder everything was still blurry.)</p>\n\n<p>Lupin tapped on your glasses with his wand, repairing them at once. Before you could say anything, he\u2019d leaned over and slid them carefully back onto your face, minding your injury; his fingers brushed against your cheeks as your vision became clear, and his face was just close enough for you to learn his eyes were green.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere we are,\u201d he smiled. \u201cJust like new.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You mumbled a small \u2018thanks\u2019 as he straightened back up to full height.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight, then. See you Monday.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You stared after him while he left, at least until the sudden, unexpected pain of Madam Pomfrey\u2019s spell snapped both you and your nose back to reality.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p><em>The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 7 </em>was propped open in front of you during dinner that evening.</p>\n\n<p>Though you were only two days into term, N.E.W.T. preparations were fully underway, starting with condensed reviews of nearly every spell, potion, and number chart you encountered throughout your first six years. Though Lupin hadn\u2019t assigned any homework, you wanted to get a head start on reviewing your old Defence Against the Dark Arts notes to prevent any repeat incidents involving embarrassingly basic spells. You <em>also </em>had a one-on-one meeting with McGonagall later that evening.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of having more than dinner on your plate that night, your attention constantly drifted towards the only empty seat at the staff table.</p>\n\n<p>Lupin wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere between the fifth and tenth glances at the staff table, your book slipped out of your hand, and page 24 received a healthy serving of gravy.</p>\n\n<p>You decided you were being ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>You would pay his office a visit and dispel the day\u2019s awkwardness before your next lesson, if only to prevent making a complete ass of yourself two Defence Against the Dark Arts classes in a row.</p>\n\n<p>After dinner, you made your way up to the second-floor corridor, mentally rehearsing bullet points of conversation on the way. You were going to apologize for causing a scene in his class earlier that afternoon. You would thank him for his help getting you to the Hospital Wing. You would promise to do better in his class. That was all. Simple and clearcut.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, just to clear the air.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a deep breath, you knocked on his office door.</p>\n\n<p>There was no answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor?\u201d you called. Maybe he\u2019d already retired to his living quarters for the night\u2013he certainly didn\u2019t look well earlier in class.</p>\n\n<p>However, as you knocked again, you noticed the doors to his office were locked\u2013not just fastened shut, but <em>magically sealed </em>.</p>\n\n<p>Behind you, a sharp voice spat out your last name.</p>\n\n<p>The call gave you a start.</p>\n\n<p>Be it due to your gross lack of awareness or his unspoken mastery of stealth, Snape had managed to make it all the way down the second-floor hallway without you noticing his approach.</p>\n\n<p>Snape looked down his nose at you, his gaze cold and unblinking. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Your first instinct was to lie, but your second instinct thought better of it. \u201cI\u2026caused a disruption in Professor Lupin\u2019s class earlier today.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You swallowed. Of course he would\u2019ve heard. \u201cYeah, so\u2026I came to apologize.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe most sincere apology,\u201d he started, raising a brow, \u201cwould be to simply <em>improve </em>your behaviour in class going forward, would it not?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure we were on good terms.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wrong answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFive points from Slytherin.\u201d The corner of Snape\u2019s nose curled, as if he suddenly smelled something foul. \u201cWe do not <em>grovel </em>for forgiveness in this house. You would do well to remember that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You bit your tongue. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, unless I\u2019m mistaken, you have a meeting to attend.\u201d He stepped aside without looking at you, making a path for you to pass by. \u201cIf you are late, I will know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As if on cue, your watch gave you a small <em>bzzt </em>on the wrist, marking your fifteen-minute warning.</p>\n\n<p>You mumbled a final, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d before passing him on your way back down the corridor.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>Out of everything you would have to face this year, you thought you were looking <em>forward </em>the completion of your Animagus training.</p>\n\n<p>Like everyone else, you first learned about Animagi in Transfiguration class during your third year. When asked about the process to become one, however, McGonagall was quick to inform you that it was an extremely rare skill not to be studied lightly; being an Animagus trained under Dumbledore himself, McGonagall wouldn\u2019t consider taking in any candidate who proved themselves anything short of outstanding in her field.</p>\n\n<p>This meant achieving top grades in both Transfiguration class and the mounds of prerequisite extracurricular homework she assigned you\u2013term after term, year after year\u2013just to convince her you were worthy of her time.</p>\n\n<p>This meant keeping your head down and not giving Snape, as your head of house, any excuse to deny you permission to pursue the additional line of study.</p>\n\n<p>This meant getting an Outstanding in <em>both </em>your Transfiguration <em>and </em>Potions O.W.L.s to qualify for private lessons with McGonagall throughout your sixth year.</p>\n\n<p>Becoming an Animagus was, above all else, an extremely <em>bizarre </em>goal\u2013a complex, demanding, high-risk process to endure for the acquisition of an esoteric skill with little to no practical use. One\u2019s efforts were much better spent in something more valuable, practical, and marketable\u2013but that was <em>why </em>you wanted to do it.</p>\n\n<p>The journey was for you and you alone, just to prove you could make it.</p>\n\n<p>At least, that\u2019s what you thought.</p>\n\n<p>McGonagall sat silent behind her desk, leaning forward as she kept her hands folded in front of her. She stared at you over the rim of her glasses, studying your pale expression, while your eyes remained fixated on the small crystal phial sitting on the desk between the two of you.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you going to be sick?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d you croaked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI urge you to do it away from my desk, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You gave a nervous laugh, though your eyes didn\u2019t move from the phial.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can revisit this next month if you\u2019re having doubts,\u201d she suggested, a bristle of impatience in her voice.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo doubts,\u201d you replied. \u201cJust nerves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d Her intensity eased, just a little. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been studying for this for almost four years,\u201d you said. \u201cIt always seemed so far away. \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus unless I get good marks on this assignment.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus unless I get perfect O.W.L.s.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus until I qualify for registration in year seven.\u2019 But <em>now </em>.\u201d You breathed another small laugh. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got the Mandrake leaf sitting right in front of me and I\u2019m <em>terrified </em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs you should be.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You tore your eyes from the phial and looked up at her, surprised.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe successful completion of the final Animagus ritual is one of the most daunting feats in the field of Transfiguration,\u201d she said, quite severely. \u201cThe slightest misstep <em>will </em>have disastrous results\u2013permanent disfiguration at best, and at <em>worst </em>\u2026well. Let\u2019s just say St. Mungo\u2019s has a long-term residents ward for a reason. You\u2019d be a fool <em>not </em>to be terrified.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor\u2013\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat being said,\u201d she continued, raising a finger to quiet you. \u201cThe <em>reason </em>this process is so involved is because it is meant to teach you the virtues of <em>knowledge </em>and <em>patience </em>. You may not find day-to-day use in becoming an Animagus, but having studied the skill <em>successfully </em>these past few years has given you a framework of discipline that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. Now,\u201d she motioned to the phial, \u201ctell me why I called you here today.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a full moon, Professor. I have to put the leaf in my mouth tonight, and keep it there until the beginning of the next cycle.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOctober 6th.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat will you do then?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMeet with Professor Snape that evening to create the Animagus potion under the light of the full moon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd if the full moon isn\u2019t completely visible on the night of October 6th?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDiscard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd if Professor Snape is unavailable to help you the night of October 6th?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDiscard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd if the leaf is swallowed or otherwise removed from your mouth at <em>any time </em>between now and the night of October 6th?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDiscard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d With a graceful nonchalance, McGonagall picked up the crystal phial containing the Mandrake leaf, and placed it into the palm of your hand. \u201cYou\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Your heart already feeling lighter, you beamed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThank you, Professor.\u201d</p>",

Your final year at Hogwarts couldn\u2019t possibly be any stranger than the previous six\u2026but seven is one of the most powerful numbers in magic, after all.</p><p>[ <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16475342/chapters/38583497\">AO3 Link</a> ]</p><p>\n\n<b>Author\u2019s Notes:</b> Co-written by Andrew. Follow the blog @ <a href=\"http://mahpiohanzia.tumblr.com\">http://mahpiohanzia.tumblr.com</a></p><p>\n\n<b>Notes: </b>what do you guys think so far?? please let me know!<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>If you were asked to sum yourself up in a single word, that word would be \u2018tired\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>The final couple years\u2019 curriculum at Hogwarts was dedicated to preparing students for N.E.W.T.s at the end of their seventh year. Your workload for year six was overwhelming, and with graduation on the horizon, you had no reason to doubt year seven would be even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Your stellar academic performance so far was wholly attributed to hard work and sheer force of will\u2013doubly so, as you entered the tail-end of your education. Within the past year, to keep up with the quality of your coursework, you\u2019d evolved into a hyper-focused, largely isolated monstrosity of a workaholic; you never considered yourself antisocial before, but there were only so many times you could turn down your roomates\u2019 invitations to hang out before they stopped asking altogether.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, you kept huddled against the window of your compartment, rain showering the glass as the constant rumble of the train rocked you to sleep. You were practically swaddled within your robes, having changed into your uniform early for the sole purpose of sleeping as much as you could on the way there.</p>\n\n<p>Although you\u2019d fallen asleep alone, by the time you reached Hogsmeade Station, you woke to the anxious chatter of fellow members from Slytherin house, who\u2019d used your colours as territorial claim to the train compartment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d squeaked a small second-year girl sitting across from you. \u201cThey\u2019re awake!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A young man with broad shoulders and fantastic hair looked over at you, concerned. \u201cDid you actually sleep through that whole thing? You weren\u2019t just faking?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t get much sleep last night,\u201d you lied, annoyed at having to explain yourself. You rubbed at your eyes beneath your glasses. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When the rest of the compartment exchanged wary glances, you realized at once that something was <em>very </em>wrong.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The enchanted ceiling showed a dark, muddied sky still recovering from the evening storm, as if the weather mirrored the dim atmosphere of the Great Hall. Beneath the light of a thousand flickering candles, the entire school sat in rapt attention during Dumbledore\u2019s announcements, with many of the younger years breaking into nervous discussion at the mention of dementors. In light of recent events, you were told, security at Hogwarts had been escalated, with the infamous wraiths of Azkaban now guarding every entrance to the grounds.</p>\n\n<p>When your housemates filled you in on the dementor-related mishap on the train, you were suddenly very glad to be a heavy sleeper.</p>\n\n<p>Shifting gears, Dumbledore went on to introduce the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor: a rather plain, shabby-looking gentleman who looked as if he hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in years. Even more surprising, however, was the retirement of Professor Kettleburn, and the appointment of Hagrid to the position of Care of Magical Creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone had taken Professor Kettleburn\u2019s class, but <em>everyone </em>knew Hagrid.</p>\n\n<p>After the last of the dessert disappeared and bedtime was finally called, you used the ensuing crowd as cover to approach the end of the staff table where Hagrid sat.</p>\n\n<p>You caught his eye, and offered a handshake. \u201cCongratulations, <em>Professor </em>Hagrid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used ter that!\u201d the large man bellowed, going red in the cheeks as his hands practically swallowed yours. \u201cAppreciate it, though\u2013<em>really </em>lookin\u2019 forward ter it. Got some <em>great </em>lessons planned. Will I be seein\u2019 yeh there, erm\u2026sorry, didn\u2019 catch yer name?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You reintroduced yourself. \u201cAnd no, unfortunately\u2013I never got the O.W.L.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh, well\u2026\u201d He hesitated for a moment, glancing at the green and silver of your robes, before shaking his shaggy head and waving a hand dismissively. \u201cNonsense\u2013yeh ever wan\u2019 ter sit in on a lesson, yeh jus\u2019 let me know. I\u2019d be glad ter have yeh.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlanning extra lessons before receiving your timetable?\u201d came the stern voice of a familiar witch. \u201cQuite optimistic for a seventh-year.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hagrid straightened up like <em>he </em>was the one in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>An older woman stepped out from behind him, wearing dark green robes and a strict expression, her grey hair pulled into a tight bun beneath her pointed hat. Although never an unfair teacher, she exuded a presence that always made you feel like she\u2019d caught you in the act of doing something unsavoury\u2013this would make you nervous, which would make her suspicious, which would toss you into an endless feedback loop of looking highly suspect over absolutely nothing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor McGonagall,\u201d you greeted with false cheer. \u201cHave a good summer?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Her intense gaze did not falter. \u201cDid you receive my note before the start of term?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI did, ma\u2019am, yes. Your office, Friday evening.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood. Now, enough dawdling\u2013please make your way to the dormitories with the rest of your house.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You obliged, taking the excuse to break eye contact with her as you retreated from the staff table.</p>\n\n<p>You glanced a goodbye at Hagrid, who mouthed \u2018Let me know\u2019 and gave you a thumbs up as you left.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<center><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1030\" data-orig-width=\"1498\" data-orig-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f3758244fda50859cf353db60af0cf3/tumblr_inline_pioyxagRYO1qc1gpe_540.png\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-height=\"1030\" data-orig-width=\"1498\" data-orig-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\"></figure></center>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\">[ Image Full View ]</a></center>\n\n<p>Save for some minor changes, your timetable was the same as that of your previous year. The large amount of free periods once gave you the misconception of free time, back when you were na\u00efve to the ways of the world, but after the near-daily ten-hour study sessions of your sixth year, you knew better than to fall for <em>that </em>illusion again.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping time would be important this year, so you\u2019d bought a watch over the summer\u2013simple and black, with silver embellishments. The watch itself was charmed to zap you with a small electric shock at set times throughout the day. You enchanted it with your school schedule.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for the first few weeks of term to be punctuated with various mishaps that spread around the school like wildfire. Draco Malfoy, the pompous third-year son of a powerful political figure, managed to get himself injured the first day of classes, and rumour had it he was milking it for all it was worth.</p>\n\n<p>You never subscribed to pure-blood elitism or discrimination, nor did the majority of your house\u2013more than half of the entire Hogwarts student body was half-blood or Muggleborn, after all, Slytherin population included. Yet, it was people <em>like </em>Malfoy who reminded you that the loudest, most obnoxious members of any group were the ones responsible for its reputation, and whenever you caught the pathetic thirteen-year-old boy strutting through the halls, retelling the increasingly outlandish tale of how he almost lost his arm to a rabid Hippogriff, you couldn\u2019t help but feel deep embarrassment for your house.</p>\n\n<p>There was little time to dwell, however.</p>\n\n<p>Seventh-year N.E.W.T. courses featured advanced-level magic with smaller, mixed-house classes, meaning much stronger individual attention and higher workloads. Two days into term and the assigned readings were already threatening to consume your entire weekend, and the only reason you wanted Friday to be over was to get a headstart on Monday\u2019s assignments.</p>\n\n<p>Your last class of the week was your first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, and somehow, Professor Lupin looked even <em>worse </em>than he did at the start-of-term feast.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you were only a few feet away from him, you learned he was a taller man, his tousled brown hair salted with touches of grey far beyond his years. He wore clothes a half-size too large for his frame; the fabric of his cardigan was pilling at the edges, and his robes had clearly been darned in several places. It was a good thing none of the classroom windows were open, you thought to yourself, as a stiff breeze would\u2019ve been sure to knock him over.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood afternoon, class,\u201d he began, his voice much stronger than his posture. \u201cMy name is R.J. Lupin, and I have the honour of being your Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher this term. You may call me \u2018Professor.\u2019 I assure you I have been called worse things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The class gave a small laugh.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, in an attempt to establish myself as your favourite teacher <em>right </em>at the start of term, I will be administering a test for our very first class.\u201d There was a collective sigh, but Lupin was already raising a hand to placate the room. \u201cNot to worry, not to worry\u2013this won\u2019t be graded. It\u2019s just a little something to gauge the level of your study progress. I\u2019ve come to understand that your sixth-year N.E.W.T. lessons were rather\u2026inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Lockhart was a quack,\u201d shouted a voice from the back row. Sounds of agreement and jeering filled the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll the more reason for this test,\u201d he said. \u201cYour N.E.W.T.s are at the end of this year, and if I am to prepare you for them, I must learn <em>exactly </em>what you don\u2019t know.\u201d He took his wand from his inner pocket and gave it a wave. From a large stack on his desk, folded sheets of parchment distributed themselves around the class. \u201cAgain, this is <em>not </em>being marked\u2013answer what you can, leave blank what you cannot. You have thirty minutes. Begin.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You unfolded the parchment in front of you, dipped your quill into your inkwell, and set to work.</p>\n\n<p>The exam began with simple questions that could be answered in a few words or less, about dark magical creatures, general defensive spell knowledge, and various incantations. As you progressed through the parchment, however, the questions grew more complicated; there were sections in which to illustrate differences between mirrored and non-mirrored wand movements, the most efficient methods of spell-chaining, and questions regarding counterspell theories you only vaguely remembered reading about. As instructed, you began skipping questions you didn\u2019t know the answer to, until you reached the end and realized in a heart-sinking panic that nearly half of your test was blank.</p>\n\n<p>All too quickly, Lupin called time, and with another wave of his wand, gathered the papers back to his desk. As your half-empty parchment slid away, you immediately glanced around the room to gauge overall impressions of the exam; thankfully, at least you weren\u2019t the <em>only </em>one looking bewildered.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood, good\u2013thank you, this will be very helpful.\u201d Lupin arranged the completed exams back into a neat pile on his desk. \u201cAs I\u2019ll need some time to get up to speed, I will <em>not </em>be assigning any homework this weekend\u2013however, I <em>would </em>like to finish today\u2019s class with a bit of a practical test. Everyone, put away your things and pair up, please, facing one another.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As everyone packed up and got to their feet, Lupin moved the rows of desks up against the walls, clearing enough room on the floor for two lines of students. By process of elimination, you ended up pairing against a familiar, burly seventh-year with short hair and a strong jawline\u2013the infamously tenacious Quidditch Captain of the Gryffindor team, Oliver Wood.</p>\n\n<p>Wood pursed his lips and gave you a polite smile. You returned it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, get out your wands,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI\u2019d like to measure your proficiency with nonverbal spellwork. Should be very straightforward.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You pulled out your wand from your inner robe pocket: a jet-black length of carved wood, the edges where your fingers rested worn to a dark grey. Nonverbal spells were a well-practiced skill learned at the beginning of your previous year\u2013even if Lockhart didn\u2019t teach them, <em>every </em>spell learned across classes during your sixth year was expected to be performed without speaking.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThose on my right,\u201d Lupin called out, raising a hand to indicate the row, \u201cwill cast a Stunning Spell on their opponent without speaking, on my mark. Those on my left will cast a Shield Charm in return, <em>also </em>without speaking. For those casting Shield Charms, please <em>dissipate </em>the Stun instead of <em>deflecting </em>it\u2013I\u2019d appreciate keeping my classroom intact, if possible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The students in your row would be performing first.</p>\n\n<p>You made eye contact with Wood and nodded, making sure he was ready. He nodded back.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWands at the ready, very good. Three, two, one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>With a sharp flick of your wrist, you cast a Stunning Spell in Wood\u2019s direction. A burst of red light shot from the end of your wand. Wood shielded himself against it easily, dissipating your spell into a small wisp of red smoke. All your neighbors shared identical results.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cLet\u2019s switch, now, wands at the ready. Three, two, one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mirroring the rest of the students in his row, Wood raised his wand at you, and cast the spell.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until the jet of red light sped towards you when you realized you\u2019d forgotten the Shield Charm incantation completely.</p>\n\n<p>Muscle memory alone drew your wand in front of you with the correct motion, but without the proper incantation to go with it, the Stun ricocheted off the end of your wand\u2013and straight into your own face.</p>\n\n<p>You were on your back in an instant, halfway across the classroom floor.</p>\n\n<p>Gasps of shocked laughter accompanied the loud, painful ringing in your ears. Somewhere in the distance, you could hear Wood apologizing like mad.</p>\n\n<p>The ceiling of the classroom spun and blurred into your vision. Your eyes were stinging, and you were trying to will them <em>not </em>to water up, if only to save what little dignity you had left\u2013you weren\u2019t <em>actually </em>crying, you were experiencing that awful, biting, welling reflex of getting hit hard in the face, but you knew there was no difference to the outside eye.</p>\n\n<p>You tasted copper in the back of your throat long before you realized your nose was bleeding.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, there were a pair of hands on you\u2013someone was guiding you to your feet, hooking one of your arms around their shoulders to help you walk.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cClass dismissed,\u201d Lupin said abruptly, leading you from the room.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>The first week of term was typically the busiest for Madam Pomfrey, and today was no exception. By the sound of it, she had her hands full tending to several first-years who, on a dare from a rival house, ignored instructions during Herbology and were now paying a painful, swollen price for it.</p>\n\n<p>You sat in silence in the Hospital Wing lobby, one hand still wrapped tightly around your wand, the other holding your sleeve against your nose to stifle the bleeding. Your face was burning\u2013partly from the pain, partly from the sheer embarrassment of having a <em>teacher </em>waiting there with you in the neighboring seat.</p>\n\n<p>More than anything, you wished Lupin would\u2019ve just left you there to stew in peace, but the man seemed dead-set on doing the exact opposite. He\u2019d helped you to the Hospital Wing, after all\u2013there was no polite way of asking him to leave.</p>\n\n<p>There was also no <em>polite </em>way of holding back the frustration bubbling inside you, either, so after several minutes of idle silence, you stopped trying.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Protego </em>,\u201d you snarled. The injury dulled your syllables, like you had a stuffy nose. \u201cThe incantation is <em>Protego </em>. That\u2019s <em>fourth-year </em>stuff, for Merlin\u2019s sake\u2013how am I supposed to pass my N.E.W.T.s if I can\u2019t remember <em>Protego </em>?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d he said, softly. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for doing a practical test without having a proper understanding of everyone\u2019s abilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know the spell,\u201d you snapped. \u201cI just\u2013\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2013haven\u2019t used it in a long time, I understand. But this could\u2019ve been avoided if I simply had everyone recite the spells before we began casting them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, this could\u2019ve been <em>avoided </em>if I just remembered the bloody spell. I was the only one in the class who forgot it, this is on me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn oversight on both our parts, then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His tone sounded final, and you bit back the urge to argue. You weren\u2019t sure why he was being so understanding about this whole thing, but you knew you\u2019d be a fool to challenge it.</p>\n\n<p>With one part of your robe sleeve thoroughly soaked with blood, you made a disgusted noise as you folded over a dry part of the fabric and pressed your leaking nose to it. \u201cS\u2019pose I won\u2019t be gracing the cover of the Daily Prophet any time soon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Lupin leaned over in his chair and looked at you, reacquainting himself with your injury. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d he assured. \u201cWhen I was your age, I fumbled a fairly standard Conjuring Spell during class. I learned two things that day: that enunciation is <em>vital </em>, even if it\u2019s just in your head\u2013and that birds like to go for the eyes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You gave a snort of laughter, then an immediate curse of pain as it reminded you that your nose was broken.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, sounding more amused than sincere.</p>\n\n<p>You shrugged it off. \u201cDid that really happen?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFeel free to ask Professor McGonagall yourself. Definitely wasn\u2019t one of my <em>proudest </em>exams.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d You dangled the wand in your other hand in a hopeless sort of motion. \u201cThis isn\u2019t one of my proudest days, either.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the antique you have there,\u201d he said, motioning towards your wand. \u201cEbony?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d You looked it over. Did he just call your wand <em>old </em>? \u201cMy grandfather left it to me. Phoenix feather cores are rather rare\u2013I guess he reckoned I could squeeze another lifetime out of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You shrugged, sliding the wand back into your inner robe pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I guess. A little temperamental. It, uh.\u201d You clicked your tongue and motioned to your face. \u201cDoesn\u2019t like unclear instructions.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He leaned in for a whisper. \u201cIn its defence, I doubt many of us do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Remembering not to laugh, you instead smiled into your sleeve.</p>\n\n<p>Without warning, Madam Pomfrey swept into the lobby, her stark-white robes billowing behind her as she towered over your seated form. She moved your arm from your nose, holding your chin and tilting your face from side to side as if she were examining a particularly interesting fruit. \u201cAnd what have we here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA rebounded Stunning Spell,\u201d said Lupin.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBroken nose and a black eye, easy fix.\u201d She turned heel and made her way back into the main ward. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Now that you were being looked after, Lupin got to his feet and prepared to leave before Madam Pomfrey managed to shoo him away, grabbing his robe from the back of his chair and folding it over his forearm. Your conversation had made you feel so at ease that you\u2019d forgotten to be embarrassed he was still there.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d He reached into the pocket of his cardigan and pulled out your pair of broken glasses.</p>\n\n<p>(No wonder everything was still blurry.)</p>\n\n<p>Lupin tapped on your glasses with his wand, repairing them at once. Before you could say anything, he\u2019d leaned over and slid them carefully back onto your face, minding your injury; his fingers brushed against your cheeks as your vision became clear, and his face was just close enough for you to learn his eyes were green.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere we are,\u201d he smiled. \u201cJust like new.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You mumbled a small \u2018thanks\u2019 as he straightened back up to full height.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight, then. See you Monday.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You stared after him while he left, at least until the sudden, unexpected pain of Madam Pomfrey\u2019s spell snapped both you and your nose back to reality.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p><em>The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 7 </em>was propped open in front of you during dinner that evening.</p>\n\n<p>Though you were only two days into term, N.E.W.T. preparations were fully underway, starting with condensed reviews of nearly every spell, potion, and number chart you encountered throughout your first six years. Though Lupin hadn\u2019t assigned any homework, you wanted to get a head start on reviewing your old Defence Against the Dark Arts notes to prevent any repeat incidents involving embarrassingly basic spells. You <em>also </em>had a one-on-one meeting with McGonagall later that evening.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of having more than dinner on your plate that night, your attention constantly drifted towards the only empty seat at the staff table.</p>\n\n<p>Lupin wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere between the fifth and tenth glances at the staff table, your book slipped out of your hand, and page 24 received a healthy serving of gravy.</p>\n\n<p>You decided you were being ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>You would pay his office a visit and dispel the day\u2019s awkwardness before your next lesson, if only to prevent making a complete ass of yourself two Defence Against the Dark Arts classes in a row.</p>\n\n<p>After dinner, you made your way up to the second-floor corridor, mentally rehearsing bullet points of conversation on the way. You were going to apologize for causing a scene in his class earlier that afternoon. You would thank him for his help getting you to the Hospital Wing. You would promise to do better in his class. That was all. Simple and clearcut.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, just to clear the air.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a deep breath, you knocked on his office door.</p>\n\n<p>There was no answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor?\u201d you called. Maybe he\u2019d already retired to his living quarters for the night\u2013he certainly didn\u2019t look well earlier in class.</p>\n\n<p>However, as you knocked again, you noticed the doors to his office were locked\u2013not just fastened shut, but <em>magically sealed </em>.</p>\n\n<p>Behind you, a sharp voice spat out your last name.</p>\n\n<p>The call gave you a start.</p>\n\n<p>Be it due to your gross lack of awareness or his unspoken mastery of stealth, Snape had managed to make it all the way down the second-floor hallway without you noticing his approach.</p>\n\n<p>Snape looked down his nose at you, his gaze cold and unblinking. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Your first instinct was to lie, but your second instinct thought better of it. \u201cI\u2026caused a disruption in Professor Lupin\u2019s class earlier today.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You swallowed. Of course he would\u2019ve heard. \u201cYeah, so\u2026I came to apologize.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe most sincere apology,\u201d he started, raising a brow, \u201cwould be to simply <em>improve </em>your behaviour in class going forward, would it not?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure we were on good terms.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wrong answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFive points from Slytherin.\u201d The corner of Snape\u2019s nose curled, as if he suddenly smelled something foul. \u201cWe do not <em>grovel </em>for forgiveness in this house. You would do well to remember that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You bit your tongue. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow, unless I\u2019m mistaken, you have a meeting to attend.\u201d He stepped aside without looking at you, making a path for you to pass by. \u201cIf you are late, I will know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As if on cue, your watch gave you a small <em>bzzt </em>on the wrist, marking your fifteen-minute warning.</p>\n\n<p>You mumbled a final, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d before passing him on your way back down the corridor.</p>\n\n<center>-</center>\n\n<p>Out of everything you would have to face this year, you thought you were looking <em>forward </em>the completion of your Animagus training.</p>\n\n<p>Like everyone else, you first learned about Animagi in Transfiguration class during your third year. When asked about the process to become one, however, McGonagall was quick to inform you that it was an extremely rare skill not to be studied lightly; being an Animagus trained under Dumbledore himself, McGonagall wouldn\u2019t consider taking in any candidate who proved themselves anything short of outstanding in her field.</p>\n\n<p>This meant achieving top grades in both Transfiguration class and the mounds of prerequisite extracurricular homework she assigned you\u2013term after term, year after year\u2013just to convince her you were worthy of her time.</p>\n\n<p>This meant keeping your head down and not giving Snape, as your head of house, any excuse to deny you permission to pursue the additional line of study.</p>\n\n<p>This meant getting an Outstanding in <em>both </em>your Transfiguration <em>and </em>Potions O.W.L.s to qualify for private lessons with McGonagall throughout your sixth year.</p>\n\n<p>Becoming an Animagus was, above all else, an extremely <em>bizarre </em>goal\u2013a complex, demanding, high-risk process to endure for the acquisition of an esoteric skill with little to no practical use. One\u2019s efforts were much better spent in something more valuable, practical, and marketable\u2013but that was <em>why </em>you wanted to do it.</p>\n\n<p>The journey was for you and you alone, just to prove you could make it.</p>\n\n<p>At least, that\u2019s what you thought.</p>\n\n<p>McGonagall sat silent behind her desk, leaning forward as she kept her hands folded in front of her. She stared at you over the rim of her glasses, studying your pale expression, while your eyes remained fixated on the small crystal phial sitting on the desk between the two of you.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you going to be sick?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d you croaked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI urge you to do it away from my desk, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You gave a nervous laugh, though your eyes didn\u2019t move from the phial.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can revisit this next month if you\u2019re having doubts,\u201d she suggested, a bristle of impatience in her voice.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo doubts,\u201d you replied. \u201cJust nerves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d Her intensity eased, just a little. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been studying for this for almost four years,\u201d you said. \u201cIt always seemed so far away. \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus unless I get good marks on this assignment.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus unless I get perfect O.W.L.s.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t be an Animagus until I qualify for registration in year seven.\u2019 But <em>now </em>.\u201d You breathed another small laugh. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got the Mandrake leaf sitting right in front of me and I\u2019m <em>terrified </em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs you should be.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You tore your eyes from the phial and looked up at her, surprised.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe successful completion of the final Animagus ritual is one of the most daunting feats in the field of Transfiguration,\u201d she said, quite severely. \u201cThe slightest misstep <em>will </em>have disastrous results\u2013permanent disfiguration at best, and at <em>worst </em>\u2026well. Let\u2019s just say St. Mungo\u2019s has a long-term residents ward for a reason. You\u2019d be a fool <em>not </em>to be terrified.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProfessor\u2013\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat being said,\u201d she continued, raising a finger to quiet you. \u201cThe <em>reason </em>this process is so involved is because it is meant to teach you the virtues of <em>knowledge </em>and <em>patience </em>. You may not find day-to-day use in becoming an Animagus, but having studied the skill <em>successfully </em>these past few years has given you a framework of discipline that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. Now,\u201d she motioned to the phial, \u201ctell me why I called you here today.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2026it\u2019s a full moon, Professor. I have to put the leaf in my mouth tonight, and keep it there until the beginning of the next cycle.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOctober 6th.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat will you do then?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMeet with Professor Snape that evening to create the Animagus potion under the light of the full moon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd if the full moon isn\u2019t completely visible on the night of October 6th?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDiscard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd if Professor Snape is unavailable to help you the night of October 6th?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDiscard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd if the leaf is swallowed or otherwise removed from your mouth at <em>any time </em>between now and the night of October 6th?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDiscard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d With a graceful nonchalance, McGonagall picked up the crystal phial containing the Mandrake leaf, and placed it into the palm of your hand. \u201cYou\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Your heart already feeling lighter, you beamed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThank you, Professor.\u201d</p>",

Your workload for year six was overwhelming, and with graduation on the horizon, you had no reason to doubt year seven would be even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Your stellar academic performance so far was wholly attributed to hard work and sheer force of will&ndash;doubly so, as you entered the tail-end of your education. Within the past year, to keep up with the quality of your coursework, you&rsquo;d evolved into a hyper-focused, largely isolated monstrosity of a workaholic; you never considered yourself antisocial before, but there were only so many times you could turn down your roomates&rsquo; invitations to hang out before they stopped asking altogether.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, you kept huddled against the window of your compartment, rain showering the glass as the constant rumble of the train rocked you to sleep. You were practically swaddled within your robes, having changed into your uniform early for the sole purpose of sleeping as much as you could on the way there.</p>\n\n<p>Although you&rsquo;d fallen asleep alone, by the time you reached Hogsmeade Station, you woke to the anxious chatter of fellow members from Slytherin house, who&rsquo;d used your colours as territorial claim to the train compartment.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; squeaked a small second-year girl sitting across from you. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>A young man with broad shoulders and fantastic hair looked over at you, concerned. &ldquo;Did you actually sleep through that whole thing? You weren&rsquo;t just faking?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night,&rdquo; you lied, annoyed at having to explain yourself. You rubbed at your eyes beneath your glasses. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>When the rest of the compartment exchanged wary glances, you realized at once that something was <em>very </em>wrong.</p>\n\n-\n\n<p>&ldquo;It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The enchanted ceiling showed a dark, muddied sky still recovering from the evening storm, as if the weather mirrored the dim atmosphere of the Great Hall. Beneath the light of a thousand flickering candles, the entire school sat in rapt attention during Dumbledore&rsquo;s announcements, with many of the younger years breaking into nervous discussion at the mention of dementors. In light of recent events, you were told, security at Hogwarts had been escalated, with the infamous wraiths of Azkaban now guarding every entrance to the grounds.</p>\n\n<p>When your housemates filled you in on the dementor-related mishap on the train, you were suddenly very glad to be a heavy sleeper.</p>\n\n<p>Shifting gears, Dumbledore went on to introduce the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor: a rather plain, shabby-looking gentleman who looked as if he hadn&rsquo;t had a good night&rsquo;s sleep in years. Even more surprising, however, was the retirement of Professor Kettleburn, and the appointment of Hagrid to the position of Care of Magical Creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone had taken Professor Kettleburn&rsquo;s class, but <em>everyone </em>knew Hagrid.</p>\n\n<p>After the last of the dessert disappeared and bedtime was finally called, you used the ensuing crowd as cover to approach the end of the staff table where Hagrid sat.</p>\n\n<p>You caught his eye, and offered a handshake. &ldquo;Congratulations, <em>Professor </em>Hagrid.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get used ter that!&rdquo; the large man bellowed, going red in the cheeks as his hands practically swallowed yours. &ldquo;Appreciate it, though&ndash;<em>really </em>lookin&rsquo; forward ter it. Got some <em>great </em>lessons planned. Will I be seein&rsquo; yeh there, erm&hellip;sorry, didn&rsquo; catch yer name?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You reintroduced yourself. &ldquo;And no, unfortunately&ndash;I never got the O.W.L.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ah, well&hellip;&rdquo; He hesitated for a moment, glancing at the green and silver of your robes, before shaking his shaggy head and waving a hand dismissively. &ldquo;Nonsense&ndash;yeh ever wan&rsquo; ter sit in on a lesson, yeh jus&rsquo; let me know. I&rsquo;d be glad ter have yeh.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Planning extra lessons before receiving your timetable?&rdquo; came the stern voice of a familiar witch. &ldquo;Quite optimistic for a seventh-year.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Hagrid straightened up like <em>he </em>was the one in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>An older woman stepped out from behind him, wearing dark green robes and a strict expression, her grey hair pulled into a tight bun beneath her pointed hat. Although never an unfair teacher, she exuded a presence that always made you feel like she&rsquo;d caught you in the act of doing something unsavoury&ndash;this would make you nervous, which would make her suspicious, which would toss you into an endless feedback loop of looking highly suspect over absolutely nothing.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Professor McGonagall,&rdquo; you greeted with false cheer. &ldquo;Have a good summer?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you.&rdquo; Her intense gaze did not falter. &ldquo;Did you receive my note before the start of term?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I did, ma&rsquo;am, yes. Your office, Friday evening.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Good. Now, enough dawdling&ndash;please make your way to the dormitories with the rest of your house.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You obliged, taking the excuse to break eye contact with her as you retreated from the staff table.</p>\n\n<p>You glanced a goodbye at Hagrid, who mouthed &lsquo;Let me know&rsquo; and gave you a thumbs up as you left.</p>\n\n-\n\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f3758244fda50859cf353db60af0cf3/tumblr_inline_pioyxagRYO1qc1gpe_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure>\n\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aUaLJv.png\">[ Image Full View ]</a>\n\n<p>Save for some minor changes, your timetable was the same as that of your previous year. The large amount of free periods once gave you the misconception of free time, back when you were na&iuml;ve to the ways of the world, but after the near-daily ten-hour study sessions of your sixth year, you knew better than to fall for <em>that </em>illusion again.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping time would be important this year, so you&rsquo;d bought a watch over the summer&ndash;simple and black, with silver embellishments. The watch itself was charmed to zap you with a small electric shock at set times throughout the day. You enchanted it with your school schedule.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t unusual for the first few weeks of term to be punctuated with various mishaps that spread around the school like wildfire. Draco Malfoy, the pompous third-year son of a powerful political figure, managed to get himself injured the first day of classes, and rumour had it he was milking it for all it was worth.</p>\n\n<p>You never subscribed to pure-blood elitism or discrimination, nor did the majority of your house&ndash;more than half of the entire Hogwarts student body was half-blood or Muggleborn, after all, Slytherin population included. Yet, it was people <em>like </em>Malfoy who reminded you that the loudest, most obnoxious members of any group were the ones responsible for its reputation, and whenever you caught the pathetic thirteen-year-old boy strutting through the halls, retelling the increasingly outlandish tale of how he almost lost his arm to a rabid Hippogriff, you couldn&rsquo;t help but feel deep embarrassment for your house.</p>\n\n<p>There was little time to dwell, however.</p>\n\n<p>Seventh-year N.E.W.T. courses featured advanced-level magic with smaller, mixed-house classes, meaning much stronger individual attention and higher workloads. Two days into term and the assigned readings were already threatening to consume your entire weekend, and the only reason you wanted Friday to be over was to get a headstart on Monday&rsquo;s assignments.</p>\n\n<p>Your last class of the week was your first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, and somehow, Professor Lupin looked even <em>worse </em>than he did at the start-of-term feast.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you were only a few feet away from him, you learned he was a taller man, his tousled brown hair salted with touches of grey far beyond his years. He wore clothes a half-size too large for his frame; the fabric of his cardigan was pilling at the edges, and his robes had clearly been darned in several places. It was a good thing none of the classroom windows were open, you thought to yourself, as a stiff breeze would&rsquo;ve been sure to knock him over.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, class,&rdquo; he began, his voice much stronger than his posture. &ldquo;My name is R.J. Lupin, and I have the honour of being your Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher this term. You may call me &lsquo;Professor.&rsquo; I assure you I have been called worse things.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The class gave a small laugh.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, in an attempt to establish myself as your favourite teacher <em>right </em>at the start of term, I will be administering a test for our very first class.&rdquo; There was a collective sigh, but Lupin was already raising a hand to placate the room. &ldquo;Not to worry, not to worry&ndash;this won&rsquo;t be graded. It&rsquo;s just a little something to gauge the level of your study progress. I&rsquo;ve come to understand that your sixth-year N.E.W.T. lessons were rather&hellip;inconsistent.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because Lockhart was a quack,&rdquo; shouted a voice from the back row. Sounds of agreement and jeering filled the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;All the more reason for this test,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your N.E.W.T.s are at the end of this year, and if I am to prepare you for them, I must learn <em>exactly </em>what you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He took his wand from his inner pocket and gave it a wave. From a large stack on his desk, folded sheets of parchment distributed themselves around the class. &ldquo;Again, this is <em>not </em>being marked&ndash;answer what you can, leave blank what you cannot. You have thirty minutes. Begin.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You unfolded the parchment in front of you, dipped your quill into your inkwell, and set to work.</p>\n\n<p>The exam began with simple questions that could be answered in a few words or less, about dark magical creatures, general defensive spell knowledge, and various incantations. As you progressed through the parchment, however, the questions grew more complicated; there were sections in which to illustrate differences between mirrored and non-mirrored wand movements, the most efficient methods of spell-chaining, and questions regarding counterspell theories you only vaguely remembered reading about. As instructed, you began skipping questions you didn&rsquo;t know the answer to, until you reached the end and realized in a heart-sinking panic that nearly half of your test was blank.</p>\n\n<p>All too quickly, Lupin called time, and with another wave of his wand, gathered the papers back to his desk. As your half-empty parchment slid away, you immediately glanced around the room to gauge overall impressions of the exam; thankfully, at least you weren&rsquo;t the <em>only </em>one looking bewildered.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Good, good&ndash;thank you, this will be very helpful.&rdquo; Lupin arranged the completed exams back into a neat pile on his desk. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;ll need some time to get up to speed, I will <em>not </em>be assigning any homework this weekend&ndash;however, I <em>would </em>like to finish today&rsquo;s class with a bit of a practical test. Everyone, put away your things and pair up, please, facing one another.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>As everyone packed up and got to their feet, Lupin moved the rows of desks up against the walls, clearing enough room on the floor for two lines of students. By process of elimination, you ended up pairing against a familiar, burly seventh-year with short hair and a strong jawline&ndash;the infamously tenacious Quidditch Captain of the Gryffindor team, Oliver Wood.</p>\n\n<p>Wood pursed his lips and gave you a polite smile. You returned it.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, get out your wands,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to measure your proficiency with nonverbal spellwork. Should be very straightforward.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You pulled out your wand from your inner robe pocket: a jet-black length of carved wood, the edges where your fingers rested worn to a dark grey. Nonverbal spells were a well-practiced skill learned at the beginning of your previous year&ndash;even if Lockhart didn&rsquo;t teach them, <em>every </em>spell learned across classes during your sixth year was expected to be performed without speaking.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Those on my right,&rdquo; Lupin called out, raising a hand to indicate the row, &ldquo;will cast a Stunning Spell on their opponent without speaking, on my mark. Those on my left will cast a Shield Charm in return, <em>also </em>without speaking. For those casting Shield Charms, please <em>dissipate </em>the Stun instead of <em>deflecting </em>it&ndash;I&rsquo;d appreciate keeping my classroom intact, if possible.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The students in your row would be performing first.</p>\n\n<p>You made eye contact with Wood and nodded, making sure he was ready. He nodded back.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Wands at the ready, very good. Three, two, one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>With a sharp flick of your wrist, you cast a Stunning Spell in Wood&rsquo;s direction. A burst of red light shot from the end of your wand. Wood shielded himself against it easily, dissipating your spell into a small wisp of red smoke. All your neighbors shared identical results.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s switch, now, wands at the ready. Three, two, one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Mirroring the rest of the students in his row, Wood raised his wand at you, and cast the spell.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the jet of red light sped towards you when you realized you&rsquo;d forgotten the Shield Charm incantation completely.</p>\n\n<p>Muscle memory alone drew your wand in front of you with the correct motion, but without the proper incantation to go with it, the Stun ricocheted off the end of your wand&ndash;and straight into your own face.</p>\n\n<p>You were on your back in an instant, halfway across the classroom floor.</p>\n\n<p>Gasps of shocked laughter accompanied the loud, painful ringing in your ears. Somewhere in the distance, you could hear Wood apologizing like mad.</p>\n\n<p>The ceiling of the classroom spun and blurred into your vision. Your eyes were stinging, and you were trying to will them <em>not </em>to water up, if only to save what little dignity you had left&ndash;you weren&rsquo;t <em>actually </em>crying, you were experiencing that awful, biting, welling reflex of getting hit hard in the face, but you knew there was no difference to the outside eye.</p>\n\n<p>You tasted copper in the back of your throat long before you realized your nose was bleeding.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, there were a pair of hands on you&ndash;someone was guiding you to your feet, hooking one of your arms around their shoulders to help you walk.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Class dismissed,&rdquo; Lupin said abruptly, leading you from the room.</p>\n\n-\n\n<p>The first week of term was typically the busiest for Madam Pomfrey, and today was no exception. By the sound of it, she had her hands full tending to several first-years who, on a dare from a rival house, ignored instructions during Herbology and were now paying a painful, swollen price for it.</p>\n\n<p>You sat in silence in the Hospital Wing lobby, one hand still wrapped tightly around your wand, the other holding your sleeve against your nose to stifle the bleeding. Your face was burning&ndash;partly from the pain, partly from the sheer embarrassment of having a <em>teacher </em>waiting there with you in the neighboring seat.</p>\n\n<p>More than anything, you wished Lupin would&rsquo;ve just left you there to stew in peace, but the man seemed dead-set on doing the exact opposite. He&rsquo;d helped you to the Hospital Wing, after all&ndash;there was no polite way of asking him to leave.</p>\n\n<p>There was also no <em>polite </em>way of holding back the frustration bubbling inside you, either, so after several minutes of idle silence, you stopped trying.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Protego </em>,&rdquo; you snarled. The injury dulled your syllables, like you had a stuffy nose. &ldquo;The incantation is <em>Protego </em>. That&rsquo;s <em>fourth-year </em>stuff, for Merlin&rsquo;s sake&ndash;how am I supposed to pass my N.E.W.T.s if I can&rsquo;t remember <em>Protego </em>?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve nothing to be ashamed of,&rdquo; he said, softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault for doing a practical test without having a proper understanding of everyone&rsquo;s abilities.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I know the spell,&rdquo; you snapped. &ldquo;I just&ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&ndash;haven&rsquo;t used it in a long time, I understand. But this could&rsquo;ve been avoided if I simply had everyone recite the spells before we began casting them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, this could&rsquo;ve been <em>avoided </em>if I just remembered the bloody spell. I was the only one in the class who forgot it, this is on me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;An oversight on both our parts, then.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>His tone sounded final, and you bit back the urge to argue. You weren&rsquo;t sure why he was being so understanding about this whole thing, but you knew you&rsquo;d be a fool to challenge it.</p>\n\n<p>With one part of your robe sleeve thoroughly soaked with blood, you made a disgusted noise as you folded over a dry part of the fabric and pressed your leaking nose to it. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I won&rsquo;t be gracing the cover of the Daily Prophet any time soon.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Lupin leaned over in his chair and looked at you, reacquainting himself with your injury. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that bad,&rdquo; he assured. &ldquo;When I was your age, I fumbled a fairly standard Conjuring Spell during class. I learned two things that day: that enunciation is <em>vital </em>, even if it&rsquo;s just in your head&ndash;and that birds like to go for the eyes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You gave a snort of laughter, then an immediate curse of pain as it reminded you that your nose was broken.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said, sounding more amused than sincere.</p>\n\n<p>You shrugged it off. &ldquo;Did that really happen?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Feel free to ask Professor McGonagall yourself. Definitely wasn&rsquo;t one of my <em>proudest </em>exams.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, well.&rdquo; You dangled the wand in your other hand in a hopeless sort of motion. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t one of my proudest days, either.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite the antique you have there,&rdquo; he said, motioning towards your wand. &ldquo;Ebony?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh. Yeah.&rdquo; You looked it over. Did he just call your wand <em>old </em>? &ldquo;My grandfather left it to me. Phoenix feather cores are rather rare&ndash;I guess he reckoned I could squeeze another lifetime out of it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that working out for you?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You shrugged, sliding the wand back into your inner robe pocket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, I guess. A little temperamental. It, uh.&rdquo; You clicked your tongue and motioned to your face. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t like unclear instructions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He leaned in for a whisper. &ldquo;In its defence, I doubt many of us do.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Remembering not to laugh, you instead smiled into your sleeve.</p>\n\n<p>Without warning, Madam Pomfrey swept into the lobby, her stark-white robes billowing behind her as she towered over your seated form. She moved your arm from your nose, holding your chin and tilting your face from side to side as if she were examining a particularly interesting fruit. &ldquo;And what have we here?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A rebounded Stunning Spell,&rdquo; said Lupin.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Broken nose and a black eye, easy fix.&rdquo; She turned heel and made her way back into the main ward. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Now that you were being looked after, Lupin got to his feet and prepared to leave before Madam Pomfrey managed to shoo him away, grabbing his robe from the back of his chair and folding it over his forearm. Your conversation had made you feel so at ease that you&rsquo;d forgotten to be embarrassed he was still there.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; He reached into the pocket of his cardigan and pulled out your pair of broken glasses.</p>\n\n<p>(No wonder everything was still blurry.)</p>\n\n<p>Lupin tapped on your glasses with his wand, repairing them at once. Before you could say anything, he&rsquo;d leaned over and slid them carefully back onto your face, minding your injury; his fingers brushed against your cheeks as your vision became clear, and his face was just close enough for you to learn his eyes were green.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There we are,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Just like new.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You mumbled a small &lsquo;thanks&rsquo; as he straightened back up to full height.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Right, then. See you Monday.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You stared after him while he left, at least until the sudden, unexpected pain of Madam Pomfrey&rsquo;s spell snapped both you and your nose back to reality.</p>\n\n-\n\n<p><em>The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 7 </em>was propped open in front of you during dinner that evening.</p>\n\n<p>Though you were only two days into term, N.E.W.T. preparations were fully underway, starting with condensed reviews of nearly every spell, potion, and number chart you encountered throughout your first six years. Though Lupin hadn&rsquo;t assigned any homework, you wanted to get a head start on reviewing your old Defence Against the Dark Arts notes to prevent any repeat incidents involving embarrassingly basic spells. You <em>also </em>had a one-on-one meeting with McGonagall later that evening.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of having more than dinner on your plate that night, your attention constantly drifted towards the only empty seat at the staff table.</p>\n\n<p>Lupin wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere between the fifth and tenth glances at the staff table, your book slipped out of your hand, and page 24 received a healthy serving of gravy.</p>\n\n<p>You decided you were being ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>You would pay his office a visit and dispel the day&rsquo;s awkwardness before your next lesson, if only to prevent making a complete ass of yourself two Defence Against the Dark Arts classes in a row.</p>\n\n<p>After dinner, you made your way up to the second-floor corridor, mentally rehearsing bullet points of conversation on the way. You were going to apologize for causing a scene in his class earlier that afternoon. You would thank him for his help getting you to the Hospital Wing. You would promise to do better in his class. That was all. Simple and clearcut.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, just to clear the air.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a deep breath, you knocked on his office door.</p>\n\n<p>There was no answer.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Professor?&rdquo; you called. Maybe he&rsquo;d already retired to his living quarters for the night&ndash;he certainly didn&rsquo;t look well earlier in class.</p>\n\n<p>However, as you knocked again, you noticed the doors to his office were locked&ndash;not just fastened shut, but <em>magically sealed </em>.</p>\n\n<p>Behind you, a sharp voice spat out your last name.</p>\n\n<p>The call gave you a start.</p>\n\n<p>Be it due to your gross lack of awareness or his unspoken mastery of stealth, Snape had managed to make it all the way down the second-floor hallway without you noticing his approach.</p>\n\n<p>Snape looked down his nose at you, his gaze cold and unblinking. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Your first instinct was to lie, but your second instinct thought better of it. &ldquo;I&hellip;caused a disruption in Professor Lupin&rsquo;s class earlier today.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;So I heard.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You swallowed. Of course he would&rsquo;ve heard. &ldquo;Yeah, so&hellip;I came to apologize.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The most sincere apology,&rdquo; he started, raising a brow, &ldquo;would be to simply <em>improve </em>your behaviour in class going forward, would it not?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to make sure we were on good terms.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Wrong answer.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Five points from Slytherin.&rdquo; The corner of Snape&rsquo;s nose curled, as if he suddenly smelled something foul. &ldquo;We do not <em>grovel </em>for forgiveness in this house. You would do well to remember that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You bit your tongue. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, you have a meeting to attend.&rdquo; He stepped aside without looking at you, making a path for you to pass by. &ldquo;If you are late, I will know.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>As if on cue, your watch gave you a small <em>bzzt </em>on the wrist, marking your fifteen-minute warning.</p>\n\n<p>You mumbled a final, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; before passing him on your way back down the corridor.</p>\n\n-\n\n<p>Out of everything you would have to face this year, you thought you were looking <em>forward </em>the completion of your Animagus training.</p>\n\n<p>Like everyone else, you first learned about Animagi in Transfiguration class during your third year. When asked about the process to become one, however, McGonagall was quick to inform you that it was an extremely rare skill not to be studied lightly; being an Animagus trained under Dumbledore himself, McGonagall wouldn&rsquo;t consider taking in any candidate who proved themselves anything short of outstanding in her field.</p>\n\n<p>This meant achieving top grades in both Transfiguration class and the mounds of prerequisite extracurricular homework she assigned you&ndash;term after term, year after year&ndash;just to convince her you were worthy of her time.</p>\n\n<p>This meant keeping your head down and not giving Snape, as your head of house, any excuse to deny you permission to pursue the additional line of study.</p>\n\n<p>This meant getting an Outstanding in <em>both </em>your Transfiguration <em>and </em>Potions O.W.L.s to qualify for private lessons with McGonagall throughout your sixth year.</p>\n\n<p>Becoming an Animagus was, above all else, an extremely <em>bizarre </em>goal&ndash;a complex, demanding, high-risk process to endure for the acquisition of an esoteric skill with little to no practical use. One&rsquo;s efforts were much better spent in something more valuable, practical, and marketable&ndash;but that was <em>why </em>you wanted to do it.</p>\n\n<p>The journey was for you and you alone, just to prove you could make it.</p>\n\n<p>At least, that&rsquo;s what you thought.</p>\n\n<p>McGonagall sat silent behind her desk, leaning forward as she kept her hands folded in front of her. She stared at you over the rim of her glasses, studying your pale expression, while your eyes remained fixated on the small crystal phial sitting on the desk between the two of you.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Are you going to be sick?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; you croaked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I urge you to do it away from my desk, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You gave a nervous laugh, though your eyes didn&rsquo;t move from the phial.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We can revisit this next month if you&rsquo;re having doubts,&rdquo; she suggested, a bristle of impatience in her voice.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No doubts,&rdquo; you replied. &ldquo;Just nerves.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s on your mind.&rdquo; Her intensity eased, just a little. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been studying for this for almost four years,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;It always seemed so far away. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be an Animagus unless I get good marks on this assignment.&rsquo; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be an Animagus unless I get perfect O.W.L.s.&rsquo; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be an Animagus until I qualify for registration in year seven.&rsquo; But <em>now </em>.&rdquo; You breathed another small laugh. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got the Mandrake leaf sitting right in front of me and I&rsquo;m <em>terrified </em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As you should be.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You tore your eyes from the phial and looked up at her, surprised.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The successful completion of the final Animagus ritual is one of the most daunting feats in the field of Transfiguration,&rdquo; she said, quite severely. &ldquo;The slightest misstep <em>will </em>have disastrous results&ndash;permanent disfiguration at best, and at <em>worst </em>&hellip;well. Let&rsquo;s just say St. Mungo&rsquo;s has a long-term residents ward for a reason. You&rsquo;d be a fool <em>not </em>to be terrified.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Professor&ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That being said,&rdquo; she continued, raising a finger to quiet you. &ldquo;The <em>reason </em>this process is so involved is because it is meant to teach you the virtues of <em>knowledge </em>and <em>patience </em>. You may not find day-to-day use in becoming an Animagus, but having studied the skill <em>successfully </em>these past few years has given you a framework of discipline that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. Now,&rdquo; she motioned to the phial, &ldquo;tell me why I called you here today.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s a full moon, Professor. I have to put the leaf in my mouth tonight, and keep it there until the beginning of the next cycle.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Which is?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;October 6th.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What will you do then?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Meet with Professor Snape that evening to create the Animagus potion under the light of the full moon.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And if the full moon isn&rsquo;t completely visible on the night of October 6th?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Discard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And if Professor Snape is unavailable to help you the night of October 6th?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Discard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And if the leaf is swallowed or otherwise removed from your mouth at <em>any time </em>between now and the night of October 6th?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Discard the leaf, come to you, and start over again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; With a graceful nonchalance, McGonagall picked up the crystal phial containing the Mandrake leaf, and placed it into the palm of your hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Your heart already feeling lighter, you beamed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Professor.&rdquo;</p>",
