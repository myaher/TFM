Every year, Couture threw parties for each holiday \u2013 the Couture\n\u2018birthday\u2019, Halloween, Christmas, New Year\u2019s and the like. Halloween was only less\nthan a month away so the party was being planned but that was all you knew;\nonly the heads of each department \u2013 so in your case, Namjoon \u2013 were involved in\nplanning to keep it a surprise for everyone else. Last years was massive, it\nwas held at Octagon; a club that was very expensive and very hard to get in to\nand many celebrities \u2013 who are always invited \u2013<i> actually </i>showed up last year. </p><p>Hoseok, being the head of his department,\nwas now subject to all of your interrogations. </p><p>He shook his head, \u2018you know it\u2019s a\nsurprise!\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Oh please give us a hint!\u2019 Tae pouted,\n\u2018I just need to know whether to get my hopes up for a repeat of last year.\u2019</p><p>Hoseok remained adamant, \u2018no guys, you\u2019ll\njust have to wait and see!\u2019 He laughed before walking towards the elevator to\ngo back to his floor. Your eyes followed him as the elevator doors opened and\nyou saw Yoongi step out before Hoseok stepped in; the two offering one another\na quick greeting before your eyes darted back to Jimin and Tae who were still\ntheorising about the party.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t spoken to or seen Yoongi since\nFriday. You were still angry at him for leaving you high and dry \u2013 sure, you\nfinished yourself off but it would\u2019ve been better if he had helped you; not\nthat you\u2019d ever tell him that.</p><p>\u2018\u2026maybe J Lo will be there?\u2019 Tae gasped.</p><p>\u2018\u2026or they will have a free bar again?\u2019\nJimin beamed.</p><p>You hummed, \u2018I don\u2019t know, I feel like\nthere\u2019s too much going on for it to be <i>exactly</i>\nlike last year\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like what?\u2019 Tae interrupted and then you\nrealised your mistake. </p><p>With the cuts, you can only imagine how\nplanning a Halloween party was the least of Namjoon\u2019s problems but Tae and\nJimin were still in the dark about it all, everyone was. </p><p>\u2018Uh, you know like in the celeb world,\nmovies and music and stuff, not many celebrities will probably come.\u2019 You tried\nyour best to recover and thankfully Jimin and Tae seemed none the wiser to your\nawful cover up.</p><p>\u2018True but then <i>last </i>year, there was \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N? Can I speak to you in your office\nfor a moment?\u2019 you heard a voice behind you and turned around to see Yoongi.\nYou glared as though on instinct before composing yourself in front of Tae and\nJimin.</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 you smiled through gritted\nteeth before turning to the people you actually wanted to speak to, \u2018I\u2019ll see\nyou guys later.\u2019</p><p>They said goodbye and you walked to your\noffice, Yoongi trailing closely behind.</p><p>You were surprised Yoongi had initiated\nthe conversation, you wondered if maybe he was going to apologise for Friday.\nYou took a deep breath as you held the door open to your office and closed it\nafter Yoongi had walked in after you.</p><p>You crossed your arms and faced him, \u2018so,\nare you going to apolo \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You need to be more careful.\u2019 He\ninterrupted you.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You nearly blew it with Jimin and\nTaehyung out there. We can\u2019t let anyone know about the cuts and you nearly told\nthem. Have you told them already? Have you told anyone?\u2019</p><p><i>Oh.\nSo this was why he actually wanted to speak to you. But then, why did you feel\nlike he meant something else?</i></p><p>\u2018Were you listening to our conversation?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I may have overheard things; I<i> did </i>have to walk past you to get to my\ndesk. But that doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u2019</p><p>You rolled your eyes, \u2018no, I haven\u2019t told\nanyone and I\u2019m not going to. About <i>anything</i>.\u2019</p><p>And you meant <i>anything</i>. You did not want anyone knowing about yours and Yoongi\u2019s\nrendezvous on Friday. \u00a0</p><p>He smirked, \u2018are you ashamed of what\nhappened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not a kid, I always know what I\u2019m\ndoing so no, I\u2019m not ashamed. But I must break the news that it\u2019s not going to\nhappen again. For your information, I finished myself off after you left and I\nthink I\u2019m going to continue with that rather than,\u2019 you gestured to you and\nhim, \u2018<i>this</i>. I did a better job myself\nanyway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure.\u2019 He glared at you, tight\nlipped, though you saw the hint of a slight smirk. \u2018That\u2019s a shame, really.\u2019 He\nfeigned a sigh, \u2018I was going to apologise to you for leaving you there. I\nthought about it over the weekend and I know I would have hated to be left\ndenied one of nature\u2019s finest pleasures.\u2019 You scoffed but he continued, \u2018I was\ngoing to offer a redemption round but if you\u2019d rather do it yourself \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018W \u2013 wait, a redemption round?\u2019 you\nspluttered.</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m sure no one would miss me for\na while if I was to,\u2019 he walked towards you as he looked you up and down, his\neyes filled with lust and you went weak at the knees, \u2018finish what I started.\u2019</p><p>You watched him through hooded eyes as he\npressed a few kisses across your shoulder before kissing your neck. </p><p>This was dangerous. The only thing\nseparating the two of you from the rest of the office was glass. You didn\u2019t\nwant anyone to know and this was a huge risk, you knew that, yet you didn\u2019t\nstop Yoongi as his hands held your waist and caressed your sides before\nreaching down to cup your ass. </p><p>Your eyes fluttered closed as his lips\nfound the sweet spot on your neck but all too quickly he pulled away and walked\ntowards the door. </p><p>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 You quizzed,\ndisappointed at the sudden lack of contact.</p><p>\u2018You said it wouldn\u2019t happen again and\nI\u2019m just following your request.\u2019 He held his hands up in defence and you knew\nhe was teasing you. </p><p>You shouldn\u2019t give in. You were stronger\nthan that. And doing it in your office? There were too many risks.</p><p>\u2018Well, I, uh, I suppose one more time\ncouldn\u2019t hurt.\u2019 Your voice betrayed you; releasing statements before your brain\ncould even fathom them.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s smile was devious and you all of\na sudden didn\u2019t feel so betrayed by your mouth anymore.</p><p>He was mere centimetres away from you\nagain, \u2018you\u2019ve got to be quiet though, can you do that for me?\u2019 </p><p>You nodded as you grabbed his neck and\npulled him to you, connecting your lips and forgetting about the mass of people\nsat at their desks behind your door. </p><p>He kissed you back; your kisses were open\nmouthed and a constant fight for control yet the way he bent to hold the backs\nof your thighs, lifting you up to straddle his waist and press you against your\ndesk had you acquiescing to his power in seconds. </p><p>His lips trailed down your neck as you\nperched on the edge of your desk, lifting your hips to press against his\ngrowing bulge as he stood in between your parted legs. </p><p>\u2018You must have been so angry with me,\nhuh?\u2019 He murmured, his kisses sloppy against your neck. </p><p>You hummed, focusing on the way his hand\ntrailed up your leg and under your skirt, making patterns across your inner\nthigh causing you to shiver at the contact.</p><p>\u2018Angry at how I left you there, all wet,\nhuh?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018So angry,\u2019 you whispered, your eyes\nclosed and eyebrows furrowed as his fingers inched closer and closer to where\nyou needed him. </p><p>\u2018You were so wet, I can still remember\nit,\u2019 he spoke softly, \u2018are you as wet for me now as you were then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God, yes Yoongi.\u2019 Your voice was shaky.</p><p>You wanted to yell at him, tell him off\nfor treating it like a game when he left you there. But the memory of Friday\nwas in your head and you wanted more. You felt him use two fingers to push your\npanties aside and your breathing hitched in your throat as you knew you were\ngoing to get what you wanted. </p><p>Slowly, his fingers ran along your folds,\n\u2018so fucking wet,\u2019 he chuckled darkly before the two digits entered you. You bit\nyour lip to prevent yourself from crying out as your head fell against his\nshoulder and his fingers swirled around your walls. You were a mess already and\nhe had only just begun. </p><p>He pumped his fingers in and out of you\nwhilst he continued his assault on your neck, filling the room with a\ncombination of the lewd sounds. You were panting, your hands clutching to the\nedge of your desk and trying your best not to make a noise as he established a\nrhythm. But all too quickly, he removed his fingers from you and you couldn\u2019t\nstop a whine leaving your mouth. \u2018Y-yoongi, please I \u2013\u2019</p><p>He hushed you by placing his two fingers,\ncoated in your juices, in your mouth which you sucked clean without hesitation\nas he watched, \u2018I bet you taste just as sweet as I remember.\u2019</p><p>You smirked up at him, opening your legs\na little wider as an invitation causing your skirt to bunch up around your\nwaist but he shook his head, \u2018I\u2019m in charge here.\u2019 He spoke lowly as he began\nto unbuckle his belt, \u2018remember that trick you pulled on me last time?\u2019 He\nasked as he grabbed your wrists and bound them together with his belt, \u2018I\ndidn\u2019t appreciate it, baby. So, you\u2019ll have a taste of your own medicine.\u2019 </p><p>In that moment, you knew he wanted to\nexert his authority. It explained why he left you to finish the job last time;\nhe was punishing you for taking control and tying him up. Despite his pettiness,\nyou were insanely turned on and no part of you wanted to protest.</p><p>He held your wrists above your head with\none of his hands, with the other he removed your panties and then began palming\nhimself through his trousers; you began struggling in your restraints: you were\nthrobbing and it seemed he was not going to relieve you any time soon. </p><p>He shook his head, \u2018no touching.\u2019 </p><p>You threw your head back in frustration\nas he chuckled, removing his hand from his crotch to his back pocket and\npulling out a condom packet, ripping it open with his teeth. \u2018I came prepared\nthis time,\u2019 he winked at you as he rolled the condom along his length. </p><p>You licked your lips at the sight, \u2018please\nYoongi,\u2019 you sighed, \u2018let me touch you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I said no touching.\u2019 His voice was stern\nand only contributed to the wetness between your thighs. </p><p>He positioned himself by your entrance\nand your breath hitched in your throat in anticipation; he brushed the tip\nalong your folds and you moaned instantly at the feeling. </p><p>He laughed breathily at your reaction,\n\u2018you\u2019re a mess already babygirl.\u2019</p><p>He finally entered you, releasing a low\ngroan you could tell he had tried to restrain as you moaned along with him. </p><p>His head rested in the crook of your neck\nas he picked up the pace, moving in and out of you at a steady rhythm. Strings\nof whimpers and moans left your mouth and it was apparent you had forgotten the\nthin walls of your office, but Yoongi hadn\u2019t. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got to be quiet or I\u2019ll have to\nstop.\u2019 He spoke and you bit your lip in a bid to do as you were told.</p><p>But the pleasure was too much, as was the\ndull ache that was forming in your arms having been held up by Yoongi for too\nlong. The moans leaving your mouth were relentless and anyone walking past your\noffice would definitely be able to hear you. </p><p>Yoongi huffed as he pulled out of you\nwithout warning. You whined, \u2018I\u2019ll be quiet, please, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 You stammered\nbetween breaths, desperate for him to resume your stimulation. </p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything as he guided you\nup, his erection red and pulsing against his stomach. He sat on one of the\nchairs to your desk and turned you around to guide you on to him, your back to\nhis chest, \u2018it\u2019s just a precaution, sweetie.\u2019 He whispered against your ear as\nyou sunk onto him and he held his hand over your mouth, the other holding onto\nyour hip to help your movements. You moaned as his length filled you but his\nhand muffled the sound. You wanted to hold on to something, anything, but your\nwrists were still bound together in front of you.</p><p>You moved up and down his length,\nswirling your hips to provoke the hisses from his mouth. You couldn\u2019t see him\nbut you knew he was straining from making any sounds and your whimpers were\nsubsiding with the hold he had over your mouth. </p><p>It was thrilling really, doing this in\nyour office. The door was unlocked and the walls were thin; anyone could walk\nin and see you or walk past and hear you; not to mention, Namjoon\u2019s office was\nonly next door. Yet, none of these thoughts stopped you from grinding on him,\nthrowing your head back to rest against his shoulder and feeling his heavy breathing\nagainst you. </p><p>His hand that was formerly on your hip\ntravelled up your side and under your shirt to cup your breast underneath your\nbra \u2013 a lace one you\u2019d worn in hopes of getting some action. He massaged it,\npinching your nipple with his forefinger and thumb occasionally whilst he began\nslowly kissing your neck, starting out with pecks before leaving a trail of\nopen mouthed kisses. </p><p>You felt him throb inside you and you\nknew it wouldn\u2019t be long before he reached his climax. You knew you were\nnearing yours but needed that extra push; you went to reach to touch yourself\nbut you remembered you were bound and unable to do so. You deflated in Yoongi\u2019s\nhold, sighing and whining at the revelation.</p><p>Sensing this, Yoongi whispered in your\near, \u2018you want to touch yourself don\u2019t you baby?\u2019</p><p>You nodded vehemently; his hand clasped\nover your mouth preventing you from showing your affirmation verbally. </p><p>\u2018If you hadn\u2019t tied <i>me</i> up last time, you\u2019d be able to touch yourself right now,\nwouldn\u2019t you?\u2019 He chastised you and you grinded your hips in response. His hand\nthat was fondling your breast moved to hold your hip in a bid to halt your\nmovements and he emitted a moan from his throat signifying your grinding had\nhad an effect on him. </p><p>He removed his hand from your mouth and\nyou panted relentlessly, \u2018please, Yoongi,\u2019 you breathed. You weren\u2019t sure what\nyou were begging for exactly, you just needed release; you were so close. </p><p>\u2018Can you promise me you\u2019ll be quiet?\u2019 </p><p>You couldn\u2019t promise him you would, but\nyou nodded anyway, desperate for him to do something. </p><p>\u2018Hmm? Use your words baby,\u2019 he spoke\nlowly before continuing leaving kisses along your neck and shoulder. </p><p>\u2018I promise. Please, make me cum Yoongi.\nTouch me, anything, please.\u2019 You pleaded through breaths, your eyebrows furrowed\nand your body jolting as he thrusted into you. </p><p>\u2018Good girl,\u2019 he whispered into your ear\nbefore his hand reached down to your core and he began to circle your clit with\nhis forefinger and middle finger. Your eyes rolled back at the feeling and your\nmouth was agape but no sound thankfully came out, you were too caught up in the\nfeeling to make a sound. </p><p>His thrusts picked up speed and his\nfingers worked your clit in time to his thrusts; the sound of his breathing\nbecame louder and faster and you knew he was close. The pooling in your stomach\nsignified you were close too. </p><p>Before long, you were jolting against him\nand biting your lip to prevent yourself from screaming out his name as your\norgasm washed over you. A moan escaped your lips but Yoongi didn\u2019t seem to\nnotice as he concentrated on chasing his own high. </p><p>You felt raw and sensitive as he\ncontinued thrusting into you, riding out your high but you moved your hips\nweakly in an attempt to help him. There was a pause and a strained groan as you\nfelt him release into the condom before relaxing into the chair as he caught\nhis breath. </p><p>The room was filled with each of your\npanting breaths as you adjusted yourself so he was no longer inside you \u2013 a\nwhimper escaping your lips at the absence. He reached his arms around your body\nto unbuckle the belt from your wrists and you moved them in circles,\nfamiliarising yourself with the freedom. </p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 Yoongi murmured, placing his\narms around your waist as you both recovered. </p><p>You nodded, \u2018yeah.\u2019 You smiled, turning\nto peck him on the lips. The position was intimate \u2013 you\u2019d never cuddled each\nother before, and to do so after sex was definitely unexpected.</p><p>You rested against him for mere moments\nwhen you suddenly became conscious of everyone outside your office \u2013 anyone\ncould have heard or figured out what was going on. You removed yourself from\nhis hold and stood up, adjusting your clothing and locating your underwear to\nput them on. From the noise behind you, you could tell Yoongi was doing the\nsame, buckling his belt and clearing his throat. </p><p>You turned to face him, suddenly awkward\nand unsure of what everything meant as he looked at you questioningly. He\nhesitantly took the few steps separating you from him, \u2018I needed that.\u2019 He\nsmirked and you rolled your eyes but bit your lip all the same, \u2018we\u2019d better\nget back to work. I\u2019ll see you in the meeting later yeah?\u2019</p><p>The meeting. You\u2019d forgotten about that.\nYou\u2019d received an email from Namjoon the night before informing you that\nSeokjin had called for a meeting with you, Namjoon, Yoongi and Jungkook to\ndiscuss plans of action. You\u2019d been dreading it and Yoongi had definitely taken\nyour mind off of it. Until now.</p><p>You nodded as he cupped your face and\npressed a kiss to your lips before leaving your office, acting as nonchalant as\npossible. </p><p>You\u2019d just inspected your office,\nensuring there was no evidence of what happened when not even a minute had\npassed before you heard a knock at your door. Your heart beat much faster than\nnormal and you silently prayed it was Yoongi again.</p><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 you called out, your voice\ntimid. </p><p>The door opened and Jimin and Tae walked\nin. You were conscious of the smell of sex in the air and the imperfections in\nyour hair and make up as a result. They, however, seemed none the wiser. </p><p>\u2018H-hi,\u2019 you smiled, your face a bright\nshade of red.</p><p>\u2018We just wanted to let you know how the\ninterview with Lee Jisoo went.\u2019 Tae beamed at you as he and Jimin each took a\nseat opposite you. You winced as you realised Jimin was sitting on the chair\nyou and Yoongi were on mere minutes before. </p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 You kept your replies short,\nworried that the shakiness in your voice would reveal too much. </p><p>\u2018So, it went really well, we thought. She\nanswered a lot of the questions we had prepared \u2013\u2019 Jimin began.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, so we asked what drew her to the\nrole for her new movie and how she thinks people will react to it \u2026\u2019 Tae\ninterrupted.</p><p>They spoke but you were too busy looking\naround the room as something in the back of your mind was alerting you that you\nhad forgotten something. You were sure there was some evidence of what you and\nYoongi had just done. Jimin and Tae were friends of yours and they would be\nunlikely to get you in trouble but sex in your office was a level of\nunprofessionalism you were not willing to advocate. Your eyes scanned the parts\nof Jimin\u2019s chair that he wasn\u2019t covering but inwardly sighed in relief as you\nfound nothing.</p><p>Perhaps you were being paranoid. </p><p>\u2018\u2026she really liked our idea for the\nphotoshoot so there was no trouble with that. The outfits looked amazing on\nher, Hoseok did such a good job\u2026\u2019 Jimin continued. </p><p>You were unsure why they had come to\nvisit you with such information. Perhaps that was why you were paranoid. They\nwould typically just send you the finished product for you and Namjoon to\napprove of before it went for print. So the fact that they were telling you\nthis made you think if there was another reason they were here and that\u2019s why\nyour eyes continued searching around the room.</p><p>\u2018Y/N?\u2019 Tae\u2019s voice caught your attention\nand you looked at him like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>You cleared your throat, \u2018sorry?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you okay? Your eyes keep moving\naround?\u2019 He questioned.</p><p>\u2018Oh, I think I\u2019ve got something in my\neye, sorry.\u2019 You laughed awkwardly and blinked a few times before going to rub\nyour eye to make your story more convincing.</p><p>The way Tae and Jimin looked at you\nemphasised you were not at all convincing. But they continued the conversation\nall the same. </p><p>It was as you had brought your hand away\nfrom your eye when the trash can next to your desk captured your attention.\nInside it, was a poorly discarded cum filled condom. You had never felt more\nanger at Yoongi than you had in that moment. You quickly averted your gaze,\nhoping Jimin and Tae wouldn\u2019t look there too. </p><p>It was apparent that they had not yet\nnoticed but the way you tapped your foot impatiently in a habit of fear was\nlikely to make them even more suspicious. Jimin was speaking but your mind was\ntoo preoccupied to acknowledge what he was saying. Tae was the object of your\nfocus as his eyes wandered around the room, taking in the details of your\noffice. He could look in the trash can at any moment. </p><p>You quickly grabbed a few tissues from\nthe tissue box on your desk and held them to your face in a feigned sneeze.\nYour attempt was poor but you excused yourself anyway and put the tissues in\nthe bin quickly covering the condom. The relief you felt in that moment was\nimmense. </p><p>They hadn\u2019t noticed. </p><p>You relaxed and began listening to them\nproperly. This time, Tae was speaking, \u2018we were able to get her comment on the\nrecent scandal between her and Kwon Joon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s brilliant!\u2019 You exclaimed,\nbecause it really was. The scandal was recent and you knew a large readership\nwill be attracted if the magazine was to publish it. A large readership may\nalso help the current situation and prevent any terminations of employees. You\nwere beaming.</p><p>\u2018It is.\u2019 Jimin sighed, \u2018but we found out\ntoday that Retro already interviewed Lee Jisoo and she spoke to them about it.\nThey published it today and everyone went crazy for it. When we publish it, it\nwould already be old news.\u2019 </p><p>You instantly deflated, your hopes dashed\nin a few sentences. </p><p>\u2018We just wanted to let you know so you\nand Namjoon can decide whether the article should include that bit. I wrote two\n\u2013 one with and one without so I can email them to you both now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019d be good. Thanks guys.\u2019 You smiled\nas they stood to leave. </p><p>Just as they were leaving, Tae turned\nback to you, \u2018did you do something in here?\u2019</p><p>You seemed to choke on air as you\nspluttered, \u2018what? What do you mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Something just seems different, the\npaint maybe?\u2019</p><p>You shook your head, \u2018no. No difference.\u2019\n</p><p>He shrugged, \u2018huh.\u2019 Before saying goodbye\nand leaving you to alert Namjoon of the bad news.</p><p>No, there was nothing different about\nyour office, really. Except for the fact it had now been christened by yours\nand Yoongi\u2019s antics. As well as the filing cabinet that had contained the\nemployee\u2019s files Yoongi once asked for was now empty, though this was a change\nyou had yet to notice yourself. \u00a0</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>You, Namjoon, Jungkook and Yoongi were\ncurrently in the elevator going up to Seokjin\u2019s office. You had told Namjoon\nabout what Jimin and Tae had informed you and he looked defeated, because you\nnow had to inform Seokjin of your progress. It was the end of the day and\neveryone else was going or had already gone home but now was the only time\nSeokjin could hold a meeting.</p><p>To say you were nervous was an\nunderstatement; you were unsure of what the current situation would mean. You\nthought there would still be time but it seemed that decisions were going to\nhave to be made soon.</p><p>No one said anything in the elevator,\nthough you were extremely aware of Yoongi standing next to you and his hand\ntrailing patterns lightly along your side. Namjoon and Jungkook were stood in\nfront of you both so could not see but that did not eliminate the possibility\nof one of them turning around. Fortunately, the doors opened and you were all\nwelcomed into Seokjin\u2019s office as he greeted you all before anyone could see\nYoongi\u2019s actions. </p><p>\u2018I just wanted a quick meeting to find\nout how everything is going and if you two wanted to share any thing you\u2019ve\nfound.\u2019 Seokjin addressed Yoongi and Jungkook and you stared at Yoongi who\nseemed unphased by your presence as he gave his answer.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve found numerous possibilities for a\nreduction in outgoings that could help the department\u2019s economic position.\u2019 He\nhanded Seokjin a small binder filled with paper, \u2018they\u2019re in there. We\nsuggested long term changes such as ones to the magazine itself which could\nprove cost effective. But there are some changes that could be made which would\nhave immediate effect.\u2019</p><p>Seokjin briefly looked through the binder\nand nodded his head, \u2018I think changes that take immediate effect would be more\nbeneficial to us. What ideas did you have in mind?\u2019</p><p>Jungkook took a deep breath, \u2018we looked\nthrough employee files and spoke to Namjoon about the possibility of employee\ntermination. We agreed that offering redundancy may be in our best interests\nfor the workers though.\u2019</p><p>Your heart began to race in anger. They\nhad access to the employee files? Namjoon knew about this? </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help yourself from asking\nquestions, \u2018how did you get the employee files?\u2019 you addressed them both but\nyour glare was fixated on Yoongi.</p><p>It was Namjoon who answered though, \u2018I gave\nthe files to them. They needed them to do their job, Y/N.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You spoke to them about redundancies?\u2019\nyou couldn\u2019t hide the feeling of being betrayed in your voice.</p><p>\u2018We just needed to think about what\u2019s\nbest for the department.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But why didn\u2019t you talk to me?\u2019 you\nbarely whispered. You thought you and Namjoon were a team and you\u2019d be\nincluded, especially in circumstances like this. </p><p>Seokjin could sense the tension and spoke\nbefore Namjoon could, \u2018Y/N, I trust you\u2019re working <i>with </i>Yoongi and Jungkook, and not against them.\u2019</p><p>You winced, forgetting Seokjin was in the\nroom and that he would not approve of your lack of professionalism.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s been a pleasure to work with,\nSeokjin.\u2019 Yoongi assured Seokjin and you looked up to see him avoiding your\ngaze.</p><p>You were grateful for his input despite the\ncurrent anger you felt towards him and decided it was best to keep quiet for\nwhatever was left of the meeting. Fortunately for you, it wasn\u2019t much longer.</p><p>\u2018Good. I won\u2019t be receiving another financial report until the end of the week so depending on that, we\u2019ll perhaps wait to see how the next issue goes before kicking things into gear. Thanks guys.\u2019 Seokjin dismissed you all. </p><p>You got up quickly and raced to the\nelevator, hoping it would come and you could go down to your office before\nanyone else could get in with you. But the world was not on your side as all\nthree men, Yoongi, Namjoon and Jungkook got in with you. </p><p>You stood in the corner and was unable to\nlook any of them in the eye; you felt awkward and not sure what to say or how\nto feel. </p><p>\u2018Y/N, it was a brief conversation, I\ndidn\u2019t think it had much importance to talk to you about.\u2019 Namjoon spoke\ngently.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019 You offered him a weak smile.\nNo decisions were actually made and as you stood their rationalising it, you\nrealised it was Yoongi you were upset with. You felt, with what was going on\nbetween the two of you, he could be more honest with you.</p><p>The elevator got to your floor and you\nfound retreat in the office, the others bidding you goodbye as they collected\ntheir things to leave. You sat in your chair and took a deep breath, closing\nyour eyes and leaning back in your chair. You had a habit of pushing the\nproblem with the company to the back of your mind \u2013 you didn\u2019t want anything\nbad to happen \u2013 so to be met with reality like this was too much.</p><p>The door opened and you didn\u2019t even need\nto open your eyes to know it was Yoongi who had the confidence to walk in to\nyour office without knocking. </p><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 he asked and you opened\nyour eyes to see he had sat in one of the chairs opposite you. He was sat in\nthe chair you fucked on hours before and you knew, unlike Jimin, Yoongi had sat\nthere deliberately. </p><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me what was going\non?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I knew you were not going to give me the\nfiles so I went to Namjoon instead. No matter what is going on between us, I\nstill have a job to do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, and that includes keeping me\ninformed. I need to know what\u2019s going on.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What? So you can complain like always?\u2019\nhe spat.</p><p>\u2018I do not complain, I simply want you to\nhave enough decency to think of the employees as people \u2013 you can\u2019t just fire\nthem without thinking how it may affect them.\u2019 Your voice was raised and you\nwere grateful everyone else had gone home.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing and you know\nit. I\u2019m here to make suggestions for all of us to come to conclusions but\nyou\u2019re not making this easy. You\u2019re acting like a child and being completely\nunprofessional. I mean I had to lie to Seokjin up there for you. Do you really\nthink you\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with when you disagree with everything I\ndo? No, you haven\u2019t \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You shouldn\u2019t have stuck up for me then,\nshould you?\u2019 you glared at him. \u00a0</p><p>He went to hold your hand across your\ndesk but you placed your hands in your lap to prevent him from doing so. \u2018I\ndidn\u2019t want you to get in trouble with Seokjin, cos we all know you would\nhave.\u2019 </p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything and just crossed\nyour arms, looking anywhere but at him. There was a slight pause before he\nspoke, \u2018stop being a brat.\u2019 He spoke softly and playfully and you were sure you\ncould see a hint of smile on his face. He was trying to lighten the mood, but\nyou proved difficult, like always.</p><p>\u2018Leave me alone Yoongi.\u2019</p><p>He sighed before standing up, \u2018you\u2019re\nmaking this so much harder than it needs to be right now.\u2019 He said, his voice\ntired and defeated. You found yourself unable to conjure a reply and only\nwatched him as he picked up his things and went into the elevator, the doors\nclosing behind him. </p>",

Every year, Couture threw parties for each holiday \u2013 the Couture\n\u2018birthday\u2019, Halloween, Christmas, New Year\u2019s and the like. Halloween was only less\nthan a month away so the party was being planned but that was all you knew;\nonly the heads of each department \u2013 so in your case, Namjoon \u2013 were involved in\nplanning to keep it a surprise for everyone else. Last years was massive, it\nwas held at Octagon; a club that was very expensive and very hard to get in to\nand many celebrities \u2013 who are always invited \u2013<i> actually </i>showed up last year. </p><p>Hoseok, being the head of his department,\nwas now subject to all of your interrogations. </p><p>He shook his head, \u2018you know it\u2019s a\nsurprise!\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Oh please give us a hint!\u2019 Tae pouted,\n\u2018I just need to know whether to get my hopes up for a repeat of last year.\u2019</p><p>Hoseok remained adamant, \u2018no guys, you\u2019ll\njust have to wait and see!\u2019 He laughed before walking towards the elevator to\ngo back to his floor. Your eyes followed him as the elevator doors opened and\nyou saw Yoongi step out before Hoseok stepped in; the two offering one another\na quick greeting before your eyes darted back to Jimin and Tae who were still\ntheorising about the party.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t spoken to or seen Yoongi since\nFriday. You were still angry at him for leaving you high and dry \u2013 sure, you\nfinished yourself off but it would\u2019ve been better if he had helped you; not\nthat you\u2019d ever tell him that.</p><p>\u2018\u2026maybe J Lo will be there?\u2019 Tae gasped.</p><p>\u2018\u2026or they will have a free bar again?\u2019\nJimin beamed.</p><p>You hummed, \u2018I don\u2019t know, I feel like\nthere\u2019s too much going on for it to be <i>exactly</i>\nlike last year\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like what?\u2019 Tae interrupted and then you\nrealised your mistake. </p><p>With the cuts, you can only imagine how\nplanning a Halloween party was the least of Namjoon\u2019s problems but Tae and\nJimin were still in the dark about it all, everyone was. </p><p>\u2018Uh, you know like in the celeb world,\nmovies and music and stuff, not many celebrities will probably come.\u2019 You tried\nyour best to recover and thankfully Jimin and Tae seemed none the wiser to your\nawful cover up.</p><p>\u2018True but then <i>last </i>year, there was \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N? Can I speak to you in your office\nfor a moment?\u2019 you heard a voice behind you and turned around to see Yoongi.\nYou glared as though on instinct before composing yourself in front of Tae and\nJimin.</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 you smiled through gritted\nteeth before turning to the people you actually wanted to speak to, \u2018I\u2019ll see\nyou guys later.\u2019</p><p>They said goodbye and you walked to your\noffice, Yoongi trailing closely behind.</p><p>You were surprised Yoongi had initiated\nthe conversation, you wondered if maybe he was going to apologise for Friday.\nYou took a deep breath as you held the door open to your office and closed it\nafter Yoongi had walked in after you.</p><p>You crossed your arms and faced him, \u2018so,\nare you going to apolo \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You need to be more careful.\u2019 He\ninterrupted you.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You nearly blew it with Jimin and\nTaehyung out there. We can\u2019t let anyone know about the cuts and you nearly told\nthem. Have you told them already? Have you told anyone?\u2019</p><p><i>Oh.\nSo this was why he actually wanted to speak to you. But then, why did you feel\nlike he meant something else?</i></p><p>\u2018Were you listening to our conversation?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I may have overheard things; I<i> did </i>have to walk past you to get to my\ndesk. But that doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u2019</p><p>You rolled your eyes, \u2018no, I haven\u2019t told\nanyone and I\u2019m not going to. About <i>anything</i>.\u2019</p><p>And you meant <i>anything</i>. You did not want anyone knowing about yours and Yoongi\u2019s\nrendezvous on Friday. \u00a0</p><p>He smirked, \u2018are you ashamed of what\nhappened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not a kid, I always know what I\u2019m\ndoing so no, I\u2019m not ashamed. But I must break the news that it\u2019s not going to\nhappen again. For your information, I finished myself off after you left and I\nthink I\u2019m going to continue with that rather than,\u2019 you gestured to you and\nhim, \u2018<i>this</i>. I did a better job myself\nanyway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure.\u2019 He glared at you, tight\nlipped, though you saw the hint of a slight smirk. \u2018That\u2019s a shame, really.\u2019 He\nfeigned a sigh, \u2018I was going to apologise to you for leaving you there. I\nthought about it over the weekend and I know I would have hated to be left\ndenied one of nature\u2019s finest pleasures.\u2019 You scoffed but he continued, \u2018I was\ngoing to offer a redemption round but if you\u2019d rather do it yourself \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018W \u2013 wait, a redemption round?\u2019 you\nspluttered.</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m sure no one would miss me for\na while if I was to,\u2019 he walked towards you as he looked you up and down, his\neyes filled with lust and you went weak at the knees, \u2018finish what I started.\u2019</p><p>You watched him through hooded eyes as he\npressed a few kisses across your shoulder before kissing your neck. </p><p>This was dangerous. The only thing\nseparating the two of you from the rest of the office was glass. You didn\u2019t\nwant anyone to know and this was a huge risk, you knew that, yet you didn\u2019t\nstop Yoongi as his hands held your waist and caressed your sides before\nreaching down to cup your ass. </p><p>Your eyes fluttered closed as his lips\nfound the sweet spot on your neck but all too quickly he pulled away and walked\ntowards the door. </p><p>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 You quizzed,\ndisappointed at the sudden lack of contact.</p><p>\u2018You said it wouldn\u2019t happen again and\nI\u2019m just following your request.\u2019 He held his hands up in defence and you knew\nhe was teasing you. </p><p>You shouldn\u2019t give in. You were stronger\nthan that. And doing it in your office? There were too many risks.</p><p>\u2018Well, I, uh, I suppose one more time\ncouldn\u2019t hurt.\u2019 Your voice betrayed you; releasing statements before your brain\ncould even fathom them.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s smile was devious and you all of\na sudden didn\u2019t feel so betrayed by your mouth anymore.</p><p>He was mere centimetres away from you\nagain, \u2018you\u2019ve got to be quiet though, can you do that for me?\u2019 </p><p>You nodded as you grabbed his neck and\npulled him to you, connecting your lips and forgetting about the mass of people\nsat at their desks behind your door. </p><p>He kissed you back; your kisses were open\nmouthed and a constant fight for control yet the way he bent to hold the backs\nof your thighs, lifting you up to straddle his waist and press you against your\ndesk had you acquiescing to his power in seconds. </p><p>His lips trailed down your neck as you\nperched on the edge of your desk, lifting your hips to press against his\ngrowing bulge as he stood in between your parted legs. </p><p>\u2018You must have been so angry with me,\nhuh?\u2019 He murmured, his kisses sloppy against your neck. </p><p>You hummed, focusing on the way his hand\ntrailed up your leg and under your skirt, making patterns across your inner\nthigh causing you to shiver at the contact.</p><p>\u2018Angry at how I left you there, all wet,\nhuh?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018So angry,\u2019 you whispered, your eyes\nclosed and eyebrows furrowed as his fingers inched closer and closer to where\nyou needed him. </p><p>\u2018You were so wet, I can still remember\nit,\u2019 he spoke softly, \u2018are you as wet for me now as you were then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God, yes Yoongi.\u2019 Your voice was shaky.</p><p>You wanted to yell at him, tell him off\nfor treating it like a game when he left you there. But the memory of Friday\nwas in your head and you wanted more. You felt him use two fingers to push your\npanties aside and your breathing hitched in your throat as you knew you were\ngoing to get what you wanted. </p><p>Slowly, his fingers ran along your folds,\n\u2018so fucking wet,\u2019 he chuckled darkly before the two digits entered you. You bit\nyour lip to prevent yourself from crying out as your head fell against his\nshoulder and his fingers swirled around your walls. You were a mess already and\nhe had only just begun. </p><p>He pumped his fingers in and out of you\nwhilst he continued his assault on your neck, filling the room with a\ncombination of the lewd sounds. You were panting, your hands clutching to the\nedge of your desk and trying your best not to make a noise as he established a\nrhythm. But all too quickly, he removed his fingers from you and you couldn\u2019t\nstop a whine leaving your mouth. \u2018Y-yoongi, please I \u2013\u2019</p><p>He hushed you by placing his two fingers,\ncoated in your juices, in your mouth which you sucked clean without hesitation\nas he watched, \u2018I bet you taste just as sweet as I remember.\u2019</p><p>You smirked up at him, opening your legs\na little wider as an invitation causing your skirt to bunch up around your\nwaist but he shook his head, \u2018I\u2019m in charge here.\u2019 He spoke lowly as he began\nto unbuckle his belt, \u2018remember that trick you pulled on me last time?\u2019 He\nasked as he grabbed your wrists and bound them together with his belt, \u2018I\ndidn\u2019t appreciate it, baby. So, you\u2019ll have a taste of your own medicine.\u2019 </p><p>In that moment, you knew he wanted to\nexert his authority. It explained why he left you to finish the job last time;\nhe was punishing you for taking control and tying him up. Despite his pettiness,\nyou were insanely turned on and no part of you wanted to protest.</p><p>He held your wrists above your head with\none of his hands, with the other he removed your panties and then began palming\nhimself through his trousers; you began struggling in your restraints: you were\nthrobbing and it seemed he was not going to relieve you any time soon. </p><p>He shook his head, \u2018no touching.\u2019 </p><p>You threw your head back in frustration\nas he chuckled, removing his hand from his crotch to his back pocket and\npulling out a condom packet, ripping it open with his teeth. \u2018I came prepared\nthis time,\u2019 he winked at you as he rolled the condom along his length. </p><p>You licked your lips at the sight, \u2018please\nYoongi,\u2019 you sighed, \u2018let me touch you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I said no touching.\u2019 His voice was stern\nand only contributed to the wetness between your thighs. </p><p>He positioned himself by your entrance\nand your breath hitched in your throat in anticipation; he brushed the tip\nalong your folds and you moaned instantly at the feeling. </p><p>He laughed breathily at your reaction,\n\u2018you\u2019re a mess already babygirl.\u2019</p><p>He finally entered you, releasing a low\ngroan you could tell he had tried to restrain as you moaned along with him. </p><p>His head rested in the crook of your neck\nas he picked up the pace, moving in and out of you at a steady rhythm. Strings\nof whimpers and moans left your mouth and it was apparent you had forgotten the\nthin walls of your office, but Yoongi hadn\u2019t. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got to be quiet or I\u2019ll have to\nstop.\u2019 He spoke and you bit your lip in a bid to do as you were told.</p><p>But the pleasure was too much, as was the\ndull ache that was forming in your arms having been held up by Yoongi for too\nlong. The moans leaving your mouth were relentless and anyone walking past your\noffice would definitely be able to hear you. </p><p>Yoongi huffed as he pulled out of you\nwithout warning. You whined, \u2018I\u2019ll be quiet, please, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 You stammered\nbetween breaths, desperate for him to resume your stimulation. </p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything as he guided you\nup, his erection red and pulsing against his stomach. He sat on one of the\nchairs to your desk and turned you around to guide you on to him, your back to\nhis chest, \u2018it\u2019s just a precaution, sweetie.\u2019 He whispered against your ear as\nyou sunk onto him and he held his hand over your mouth, the other holding onto\nyour hip to help your movements. You moaned as his length filled you but his\nhand muffled the sound. You wanted to hold on to something, anything, but your\nwrists were still bound together in front of you.</p><p>You moved up and down his length,\nswirling your hips to provoke the hisses from his mouth. You couldn\u2019t see him\nbut you knew he was straining from making any sounds and your whimpers were\nsubsiding with the hold he had over your mouth. </p><p>It was thrilling really, doing this in\nyour office. The door was unlocked and the walls were thin; anyone could walk\nin and see you or walk past and hear you; not to mention, Namjoon\u2019s office was\nonly next door. Yet, none of these thoughts stopped you from grinding on him,\nthrowing your head back to rest against his shoulder and feeling his heavy breathing\nagainst you. </p><p>His hand that was formerly on your hip\ntravelled up your side and under your shirt to cup your breast underneath your\nbra \u2013 a lace one you\u2019d worn in hopes of getting some action. He massaged it,\npinching your nipple with his forefinger and thumb occasionally whilst he began\nslowly kissing your neck, starting out with pecks before leaving a trail of\nopen mouthed kisses. </p><p>You felt him throb inside you and you\nknew it wouldn\u2019t be long before he reached his climax. You knew you were\nnearing yours but needed that extra push; you went to reach to touch yourself\nbut you remembered you were bound and unable to do so. You deflated in Yoongi\u2019s\nhold, sighing and whining at the revelation.</p><p>Sensing this, Yoongi whispered in your\near, \u2018you want to touch yourself don\u2019t you baby?\u2019</p><p>You nodded vehemently; his hand clasped\nover your mouth preventing you from showing your affirmation verbally. </p><p>\u2018If you hadn\u2019t tied <i>me</i> up last time, you\u2019d be able to touch yourself right now,\nwouldn\u2019t you?\u2019 He chastised you and you grinded your hips in response. His hand\nthat was fondling your breast moved to hold your hip in a bid to halt your\nmovements and he emitted a moan from his throat signifying your grinding had\nhad an effect on him. </p><p>He removed his hand from your mouth and\nyou panted relentlessly, \u2018please, Yoongi,\u2019 you breathed. You weren\u2019t sure what\nyou were begging for exactly, you just needed release; you were so close. </p><p>\u2018Can you promise me you\u2019ll be quiet?\u2019 </p><p>You couldn\u2019t promise him you would, but\nyou nodded anyway, desperate for him to do something. </p><p>\u2018Hmm? Use your words baby,\u2019 he spoke\nlowly before continuing leaving kisses along your neck and shoulder. </p><p>\u2018I promise. Please, make me cum Yoongi.\nTouch me, anything, please.\u2019 You pleaded through breaths, your eyebrows furrowed\nand your body jolting as he thrusted into you. </p><p>\u2018Good girl,\u2019 he whispered into your ear\nbefore his hand reached down to your core and he began to circle your clit with\nhis forefinger and middle finger. Your eyes rolled back at the feeling and your\nmouth was agape but no sound thankfully came out, you were too caught up in the\nfeeling to make a sound. </p><p>His thrusts picked up speed and his\nfingers worked your clit in time to his thrusts; the sound of his breathing\nbecame louder and faster and you knew he was close. The pooling in your stomach\nsignified you were close too. </p><p>Before long, you were jolting against him\nand biting your lip to prevent yourself from screaming out his name as your\norgasm washed over you. A moan escaped your lips but Yoongi didn\u2019t seem to\nnotice as he concentrated on chasing his own high. </p><p>You felt raw and sensitive as he\ncontinued thrusting into you, riding out your high but you moved your hips\nweakly in an attempt to help him. There was a pause and a strained groan as you\nfelt him release into the condom before relaxing into the chair as he caught\nhis breath. </p><p>The room was filled with each of your\npanting breaths as you adjusted yourself so he was no longer inside you \u2013 a\nwhimper escaping your lips at the absence. He reached his arms around your body\nto unbuckle the belt from your wrists and you moved them in circles,\nfamiliarising yourself with the freedom. </p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 Yoongi murmured, placing his\narms around your waist as you both recovered. </p><p>You nodded, \u2018yeah.\u2019 You smiled, turning\nto peck him on the lips. The position was intimate \u2013 you\u2019d never cuddled each\nother before, and to do so after sex was definitely unexpected.</p><p>You rested against him for mere moments\nwhen you suddenly became conscious of everyone outside your office \u2013 anyone\ncould have heard or figured out what was going on. You removed yourself from\nhis hold and stood up, adjusting your clothing and locating your underwear to\nput them on. From the noise behind you, you could tell Yoongi was doing the\nsame, buckling his belt and clearing his throat. </p><p>You turned to face him, suddenly awkward\nand unsure of what everything meant as he looked at you questioningly. He\nhesitantly took the few steps separating you from him, \u2018I needed that.\u2019 He\nsmirked and you rolled your eyes but bit your lip all the same, \u2018we\u2019d better\nget back to work. I\u2019ll see you in the meeting later yeah?\u2019</p><p>The meeting. You\u2019d forgotten about that.\nYou\u2019d received an email from Namjoon the night before informing you that\nSeokjin had called for a meeting with you, Namjoon, Yoongi and Jungkook to\ndiscuss plans of action. You\u2019d been dreading it and Yoongi had definitely taken\nyour mind off of it. Until now.</p><p>You nodded as he cupped your face and\npressed a kiss to your lips before leaving your office, acting as nonchalant as\npossible. </p><p>You\u2019d just inspected your office,\nensuring there was no evidence of what happened when not even a minute had\npassed before you heard a knock at your door. Your heart beat much faster than\nnormal and you silently prayed it was Yoongi again.</p><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 you called out, your voice\ntimid. </p><p>The door opened and Jimin and Tae walked\nin. You were conscious of the smell of sex in the air and the imperfections in\nyour hair and make up as a result. They, however, seemed none the wiser. </p><p>\u2018H-hi,\u2019 you smiled, your face a bright\nshade of red.</p><p>\u2018We just wanted to let you know how the\ninterview with Lee Jisoo went.\u2019 Tae beamed at you as he and Jimin each took a\nseat opposite you. You winced as you realised Jimin was sitting on the chair\nyou and Yoongi were on mere minutes before. </p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 You kept your replies short,\nworried that the shakiness in your voice would reveal too much. </p><p>\u2018So, it went really well, we thought. She\nanswered a lot of the questions we had prepared \u2013\u2019 Jimin began.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, so we asked what drew her to the\nrole for her new movie and how she thinks people will react to it \u2026\u2019 Tae\ninterrupted.</p><p>They spoke but you were too busy looking\naround the room as something in the back of your mind was alerting you that you\nhad forgotten something. You were sure there was some evidence of what you and\nYoongi had just done. Jimin and Tae were friends of yours and they would be\nunlikely to get you in trouble but sex in your office was a level of\nunprofessionalism you were not willing to advocate. Your eyes scanned the parts\nof Jimin\u2019s chair that he wasn\u2019t covering but inwardly sighed in relief as you\nfound nothing.</p><p>Perhaps you were being paranoid. </p><p>\u2018\u2026she really liked our idea for the\nphotoshoot so there was no trouble with that. The outfits looked amazing on\nher, Hoseok did such a good job\u2026\u2019 Jimin continued. </p><p>You were unsure why they had come to\nvisit you with such information. Perhaps that was why you were paranoid. They\nwould typically just send you the finished product for you and Namjoon to\napprove of before it went for print. So the fact that they were telling you\nthis made you think if there was another reason they were here and that\u2019s why\nyour eyes continued searching around the room.</p><p>\u2018Y/N?\u2019 Tae\u2019s voice caught your attention\nand you looked at him like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>You cleared your throat, \u2018sorry?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you okay? Your eyes keep moving\naround?\u2019 He questioned.</p><p>\u2018Oh, I think I\u2019ve got something in my\neye, sorry.\u2019 You laughed awkwardly and blinked a few times before going to rub\nyour eye to make your story more convincing.</p><p>The way Tae and Jimin looked at you\nemphasised you were not at all convincing. But they continued the conversation\nall the same. </p><p>It was as you had brought your hand away\nfrom your eye when the trash can next to your desk captured your attention.\nInside it, was a poorly discarded cum filled condom. You had never felt more\nanger at Yoongi than you had in that moment. You quickly averted your gaze,\nhoping Jimin and Tae wouldn\u2019t look there too. </p><p>It was apparent that they had not yet\nnoticed but the way you tapped your foot impatiently in a habit of fear was\nlikely to make them even more suspicious. Jimin was speaking but your mind was\ntoo preoccupied to acknowledge what he was saying. Tae was the object of your\nfocus as his eyes wandered around the room, taking in the details of your\noffice. He could look in the trash can at any moment. </p><p>You quickly grabbed a few tissues from\nthe tissue box on your desk and held them to your face in a feigned sneeze.\nYour attempt was poor but you excused yourself anyway and put the tissues in\nthe bin quickly covering the condom. The relief you felt in that moment was\nimmense. </p><p>They hadn\u2019t noticed. </p><p>You relaxed and began listening to them\nproperly. This time, Tae was speaking, \u2018we were able to get her comment on the\nrecent scandal between her and Kwon Joon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s brilliant!\u2019 You exclaimed,\nbecause it really was. The scandal was recent and you knew a large readership\nwill be attracted if the magazine was to publish it. A large readership may\nalso help the current situation and prevent any terminations of employees. You\nwere beaming.</p><p>\u2018It is.\u2019 Jimin sighed, \u2018but we found out\ntoday that Retro already interviewed Lee Jisoo and she spoke to them about it.\nThey published it today and everyone went crazy for it. When we publish it, it\nwould already be old news.\u2019 </p><p>You instantly deflated, your hopes dashed\nin a few sentences. </p><p>\u2018We just wanted to let you know so you\nand Namjoon can decide whether the article should include that bit. I wrote two\n\u2013 one with and one without so I can email them to you both now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019d be good. Thanks guys.\u2019 You smiled\nas they stood to leave. </p><p>Just as they were leaving, Tae turned\nback to you, \u2018did you do something in here?\u2019</p><p>You seemed to choke on air as you\nspluttered, \u2018what? What do you mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Something just seems different, the\npaint maybe?\u2019</p><p>You shook your head, \u2018no. No difference.\u2019\n</p><p>He shrugged, \u2018huh.\u2019 Before saying goodbye\nand leaving you to alert Namjoon of the bad news.</p><p>No, there was nothing different about\nyour office, really. Except for the fact it had now been christened by yours\nand Yoongi\u2019s antics. As well as the filing cabinet that had contained the\nemployee\u2019s files Yoongi once asked for was now empty, though this was a change\nyou had yet to notice yourself. \u00a0</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>You, Namjoon, Jungkook and Yoongi were\ncurrently in the elevator going up to Seokjin\u2019s office. You had told Namjoon\nabout what Jimin and Tae had informed you and he looked defeated, because you\nnow had to inform Seokjin of your progress. It was the end of the day and\neveryone else was going or had already gone home but now was the only time\nSeokjin could hold a meeting.</p><p>To say you were nervous was an\nunderstatement; you were unsure of what the current situation would mean. You\nthought there would still be time but it seemed that decisions were going to\nhave to be made soon.</p><p>No one said anything in the elevator,\nthough you were extremely aware of Yoongi standing next to you and his hand\ntrailing patterns lightly along your side. Namjoon and Jungkook were stood in\nfront of you both so could not see but that did not eliminate the possibility\nof one of them turning around. Fortunately, the doors opened and you were all\nwelcomed into Seokjin\u2019s office as he greeted you all before anyone could see\nYoongi\u2019s actions. </p><p>\u2018I just wanted a quick meeting to find\nout how everything is going and if you two wanted to share any thing you\u2019ve\nfound.\u2019 Seokjin addressed Yoongi and Jungkook and you stared at Yoongi who\nseemed unphased by your presence as he gave his answer.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve found numerous possibilities for a\nreduction in outgoings that could help the department\u2019s economic position.\u2019 He\nhanded Seokjin a small binder filled with paper, \u2018they\u2019re in there. We\nsuggested long term changes such as ones to the magazine itself which could\nprove cost effective. But there are some changes that could be made which would\nhave immediate effect.\u2019</p><p>Seokjin briefly looked through the binder\nand nodded his head, \u2018I think changes that take immediate effect would be more\nbeneficial to us. What ideas did you have in mind?\u2019</p><p>Jungkook took a deep breath, \u2018we looked\nthrough employee files and spoke to Namjoon about the possibility of employee\ntermination. We agreed that offering redundancy may be in our best interests\nfor the workers though.\u2019</p><p>Your heart began to race in anger. They\nhad access to the employee files? Namjoon knew about this? </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help yourself from asking\nquestions, \u2018how did you get the employee files?\u2019 you addressed them both but\nyour glare was fixated on Yoongi.</p><p>It was Namjoon who answered though, \u2018I gave\nthe files to them. They needed them to do their job, Y/N.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You spoke to them about redundancies?\u2019\nyou couldn\u2019t hide the feeling of being betrayed in your voice.</p><p>\u2018We just needed to think about what\u2019s\nbest for the department.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But why didn\u2019t you talk to me?\u2019 you\nbarely whispered. You thought you and Namjoon were a team and you\u2019d be\nincluded, especially in circumstances like this. </p><p>Seokjin could sense the tension and spoke\nbefore Namjoon could, \u2018Y/N, I trust you\u2019re working <i>with </i>Yoongi and Jungkook, and not against them.\u2019</p><p>You winced, forgetting Seokjin was in the\nroom and that he would not approve of your lack of professionalism.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s been a pleasure to work with,\nSeokjin.\u2019 Yoongi assured Seokjin and you looked up to see him avoiding your\ngaze.</p><p>You were grateful for his input despite the\ncurrent anger you felt towards him and decided it was best to keep quiet for\nwhatever was left of the meeting. Fortunately for you, it wasn\u2019t much longer.</p><p>\u2018Good. I won\u2019t be receiving another financial report until the end of the week so depending on that, we\u2019ll perhaps wait to see how the next issue goes before kicking things into gear. Thanks guys.\u2019 Seokjin dismissed you all. </p><p>You got up quickly and raced to the\nelevator, hoping it would come and you could go down to your office before\nanyone else could get in with you. But the world was not on your side as all\nthree men, Yoongi, Namjoon and Jungkook got in with you. </p><p>You stood in the corner and was unable to\nlook any of them in the eye; you felt awkward and not sure what to say or how\nto feel. </p><p>\u2018Y/N, it was a brief conversation, I\ndidn\u2019t think it had much importance to talk to you about.\u2019 Namjoon spoke\ngently.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019 You offered him a weak smile.\nNo decisions were actually made and as you stood their rationalising it, you\nrealised it was Yoongi you were upset with. You felt, with what was going on\nbetween the two of you, he could be more honest with you.</p><p>The elevator got to your floor and you\nfound retreat in the office, the others bidding you goodbye as they collected\ntheir things to leave. You sat in your chair and took a deep breath, closing\nyour eyes and leaning back in your chair. You had a habit of pushing the\nproblem with the company to the back of your mind \u2013 you didn\u2019t want anything\nbad to happen \u2013 so to be met with reality like this was too much.</p><p>The door opened and you didn\u2019t even need\nto open your eyes to know it was Yoongi who had the confidence to walk in to\nyour office without knocking. </p><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 he asked and you opened\nyour eyes to see he had sat in one of the chairs opposite you. He was sat in\nthe chair you fucked on hours before and you knew, unlike Jimin, Yoongi had sat\nthere deliberately. </p><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me what was going\non?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I knew you were not going to give me the\nfiles so I went to Namjoon instead. No matter what is going on between us, I\nstill have a job to do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, and that includes keeping me\ninformed. I need to know what\u2019s going on.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What? So you can complain like always?\u2019\nhe spat.</p><p>\u2018I do not complain, I simply want you to\nhave enough decency to think of the employees as people \u2013 you can\u2019t just fire\nthem without thinking how it may affect them.\u2019 Your voice was raised and you\nwere grateful everyone else had gone home.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing and you know\nit. I\u2019m here to make suggestions for all of us to come to conclusions but\nyou\u2019re not making this easy. You\u2019re acting like a child and being completely\nunprofessional. I mean I had to lie to Seokjin up there for you. Do you really\nthink you\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with when you disagree with everything I\ndo? No, you haven\u2019t \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You shouldn\u2019t have stuck up for me then,\nshould you?\u2019 you glared at him. \u00a0</p><p>He went to hold your hand across your\ndesk but you placed your hands in your lap to prevent him from doing so. \u2018I\ndidn\u2019t want you to get in trouble with Seokjin, cos we all know you would\nhave.\u2019 </p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything and just crossed\nyour arms, looking anywhere but at him. There was a slight pause before he\nspoke, \u2018stop being a brat.\u2019 He spoke softly and playfully and you were sure you\ncould see a hint of smile on his face. He was trying to lighten the mood, but\nyou proved difficult, like always.</p><p>\u2018Leave me alone Yoongi.\u2019</p><p>He sighed before standing up, \u2018you\u2019re\nmaking this so much harder than it needs to be right now.\u2019 He said, his voice\ntired and defeated. You found yourself unable to conjure a reply and only\nwatched him as he picked up his things and went into the elevator, the doors\nclosing behind him. </p></p>",

Every year, Couture threw parties for each holiday \u2013 the Couture\n\u2018birthday\u2019, Halloween, Christmas, New Year\u2019s and the like. Halloween was only less\nthan a month away so the party was being planned but that was all you knew;\nonly the heads of each department \u2013 so in your case, Namjoon \u2013 were involved in\nplanning to keep it a surprise for everyone else. Last years was massive, it\nwas held at Octagon; a club that was very expensive and very hard to get in to\nand many celebrities \u2013 who are always invited \u2013<i> actually </i>showed up last year. </p><p>Hoseok, being the head of his department,\nwas now subject to all of your interrogations. </p><p>He shook his head, \u2018you know it\u2019s a\nsurprise!\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Oh please give us a hint!\u2019 Tae pouted,\n\u2018I just need to know whether to get my hopes up for a repeat of last year.\u2019</p><p>Hoseok remained adamant, \u2018no guys, you\u2019ll\njust have to wait and see!\u2019 He laughed before walking towards the elevator to\ngo back to his floor. Your eyes followed him as the elevator doors opened and\nyou saw Yoongi step out before Hoseok stepped in; the two offering one another\na quick greeting before your eyes darted back to Jimin and Tae who were still\ntheorising about the party.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t spoken to or seen Yoongi since\nFriday. You were still angry at him for leaving you high and dry \u2013 sure, you\nfinished yourself off but it would\u2019ve been better if he had helped you; not\nthat you\u2019d ever tell him that.</p><p>\u2018\u2026maybe J Lo will be there?\u2019 Tae gasped.</p><p>\u2018\u2026or they will have a free bar again?\u2019\nJimin beamed.</p><p>You hummed, \u2018I don\u2019t know, I feel like\nthere\u2019s too much going on for it to be <i>exactly</i>\nlike last year\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like what?\u2019 Tae interrupted and then you\nrealised your mistake. </p><p>With the cuts, you can only imagine how\nplanning a Halloween party was the least of Namjoon\u2019s problems but Tae and\nJimin were still in the dark about it all, everyone was. </p><p>\u2018Uh, you know like in the celeb world,\nmovies and music and stuff, not many celebrities will probably come.\u2019 You tried\nyour best to recover and thankfully Jimin and Tae seemed none the wiser to your\nawful cover up.</p><p>\u2018True but then <i>last </i>year, there was \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N? Can I speak to you in your office\nfor a moment?\u2019 you heard a voice behind you and turned around to see Yoongi.\nYou glared as though on instinct before composing yourself in front of Tae and\nJimin.</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 you smiled through gritted\nteeth before turning to the people you actually wanted to speak to, \u2018I\u2019ll see\nyou guys later.\u2019</p><p>They said goodbye and you walked to your\noffice, Yoongi trailing closely behind.</p><p>You were surprised Yoongi had initiated\nthe conversation, you wondered if maybe he was going to apologise for Friday.\nYou took a deep breath as you held the door open to your office and closed it\nafter Yoongi had walked in after you.</p><p>You crossed your arms and faced him, \u2018so,\nare you going to apolo \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You need to be more careful.\u2019 He\ninterrupted you.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You nearly blew it with Jimin and\nTaehyung out there. We can\u2019t let anyone know about the cuts and you nearly told\nthem. Have you told them already? Have you told anyone?\u2019</p><p><i>Oh.\nSo this was why he actually wanted to speak to you. But then, why did you feel\nlike he meant something else?</i></p><p>\u2018Were you listening to our conversation?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I may have overheard things; I<i> did </i>have to walk past you to get to my\ndesk. But that doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u2019</p><p>You rolled your eyes, \u2018no, I haven\u2019t told\nanyone and I\u2019m not going to. About <i>anything</i>.\u2019</p><p>And you meant <i>anything</i>. You did not want anyone knowing about yours and Yoongi\u2019s\nrendezvous on Friday. \u00a0</p><p>He smirked, \u2018are you ashamed of what\nhappened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not a kid, I always know what I\u2019m\ndoing so no, I\u2019m not ashamed. But I must break the news that it\u2019s not going to\nhappen again. For your information, I finished myself off after you left and I\nthink I\u2019m going to continue with that rather than,\u2019 you gestured to you and\nhim, \u2018<i>this</i>. I did a better job myself\nanyway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure.\u2019 He glared at you, tight\nlipped, though you saw the hint of a slight smirk. \u2018That\u2019s a shame, really.\u2019 He\nfeigned a sigh, \u2018I was going to apologise to you for leaving you there. I\nthought about it over the weekend and I know I would have hated to be left\ndenied one of nature\u2019s finest pleasures.\u2019 You scoffed but he continued, \u2018I was\ngoing to offer a redemption round but if you\u2019d rather do it yourself \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018W \u2013 wait, a redemption round?\u2019 you\nspluttered.</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m sure no one would miss me for\na while if I was to,\u2019 he walked towards you as he looked you up and down, his\neyes filled with lust and you went weak at the knees, \u2018finish what I started.\u2019</p><p>You watched him through hooded eyes as he\npressed a few kisses across your shoulder before kissing your neck. </p><p>This was dangerous. The only thing\nseparating the two of you from the rest of the office was glass. You didn\u2019t\nwant anyone to know and this was a huge risk, you knew that, yet you didn\u2019t\nstop Yoongi as his hands held your waist and caressed your sides before\nreaching down to cup your ass. </p><p>Your eyes fluttered closed as his lips\nfound the sweet spot on your neck but all too quickly he pulled away and walked\ntowards the door. </p><p>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 You quizzed,\ndisappointed at the sudden lack of contact.</p><p>\u2018You said it wouldn\u2019t happen again and\nI\u2019m just following your request.\u2019 He held his hands up in defence and you knew\nhe was teasing you. </p><p>You shouldn\u2019t give in. You were stronger\nthan that. And doing it in your office? There were too many risks.</p><p>\u2018Well, I, uh, I suppose one more time\ncouldn\u2019t hurt.\u2019 Your voice betrayed you; releasing statements before your brain\ncould even fathom them.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s smile was devious and you all of\na sudden didn\u2019t feel so betrayed by your mouth anymore.</p><p>He was mere centimetres away from you\nagain, \u2018you\u2019ve got to be quiet though, can you do that for me?\u2019 </p><p>You nodded as you grabbed his neck and\npulled him to you, connecting your lips and forgetting about the mass of people\nsat at their desks behind your door. </p><p>He kissed you back; your kisses were open\nmouthed and a constant fight for control yet the way he bent to hold the backs\nof your thighs, lifting you up to straddle his waist and press you against your\ndesk had you acquiescing to his power in seconds. </p><p>His lips trailed down your neck as you\nperched on the edge of your desk, lifting your hips to press against his\ngrowing bulge as he stood in between your parted legs. </p><p>\u2018You must have been so angry with me,\nhuh?\u2019 He murmured, his kisses sloppy against your neck. </p><p>You hummed, focusing on the way his hand\ntrailed up your leg and under your skirt, making patterns across your inner\nthigh causing you to shiver at the contact.</p><p>\u2018Angry at how I left you there, all wet,\nhuh?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018So angry,\u2019 you whispered, your eyes\nclosed and eyebrows furrowed as his fingers inched closer and closer to where\nyou needed him. </p><p>\u2018You were so wet, I can still remember\nit,\u2019 he spoke softly, \u2018are you as wet for me now as you were then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God, yes Yoongi.\u2019 Your voice was shaky.</p><p>You wanted to yell at him, tell him off\nfor treating it like a game when he left you there. But the memory of Friday\nwas in your head and you wanted more. You felt him use two fingers to push your\npanties aside and your breathing hitched in your throat as you knew you were\ngoing to get what you wanted. </p><p>Slowly, his fingers ran along your folds,\n\u2018so fucking wet,\u2019 he chuckled darkly before the two digits entered you. You bit\nyour lip to prevent yourself from crying out as your head fell against his\nshoulder and his fingers swirled around your walls. You were a mess already and\nhe had only just begun. </p><p>He pumped his fingers in and out of you\nwhilst he continued his assault on your neck, filling the room with a\ncombination of the lewd sounds. You were panting, your hands clutching to the\nedge of your desk and trying your best not to make a noise as he established a\nrhythm. But all too quickly, he removed his fingers from you and you couldn\u2019t\nstop a whine leaving your mouth. \u2018Y-yoongi, please I \u2013\u2019</p><p>He hushed you by placing his two fingers,\ncoated in your juices, in your mouth which you sucked clean without hesitation\nas he watched, \u2018I bet you taste just as sweet as I remember.\u2019</p><p>You smirked up at him, opening your legs\na little wider as an invitation causing your skirt to bunch up around your\nwaist but he shook his head, \u2018I\u2019m in charge here.\u2019 He spoke lowly as he began\nto unbuckle his belt, \u2018remember that trick you pulled on me last time?\u2019 He\nasked as he grabbed your wrists and bound them together with his belt, \u2018I\ndidn\u2019t appreciate it, baby. So, you\u2019ll have a taste of your own medicine.\u2019 </p><p>In that moment, you knew he wanted to\nexert his authority. It explained why he left you to finish the job last time;\nhe was punishing you for taking control and tying him up. Despite his pettiness,\nyou were insanely turned on and no part of you wanted to protest.</p><p>He held your wrists above your head with\none of his hands, with the other he removed your panties and then began palming\nhimself through his trousers; you began struggling in your restraints: you were\nthrobbing and it seemed he was not going to relieve you any time soon. </p><p>He shook his head, \u2018no touching.\u2019 </p><p>You threw your head back in frustration\nas he chuckled, removing his hand from his crotch to his back pocket and\npulling out a condom packet, ripping it open with his teeth. \u2018I came prepared\nthis time,\u2019 he winked at you as he rolled the condom along his length. </p><p>You licked your lips at the sight, \u2018please\nYoongi,\u2019 you sighed, \u2018let me touch you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I said no touching.\u2019 His voice was stern\nand only contributed to the wetness between your thighs. </p><p>He positioned himself by your entrance\nand your breath hitched in your throat in anticipation; he brushed the tip\nalong your folds and you moaned instantly at the feeling. </p><p>He laughed breathily at your reaction,\n\u2018you\u2019re a mess already babygirl.\u2019</p><p>He finally entered you, releasing a low\ngroan you could tell he had tried to restrain as you moaned along with him. </p><p>His head rested in the crook of your neck\nas he picked up the pace, moving in and out of you at a steady rhythm. Strings\nof whimpers and moans left your mouth and it was apparent you had forgotten the\nthin walls of your office, but Yoongi hadn\u2019t. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got to be quiet or I\u2019ll have to\nstop.\u2019 He spoke and you bit your lip in a bid to do as you were told.</p><p>But the pleasure was too much, as was the\ndull ache that was forming in your arms having been held up by Yoongi for too\nlong. The moans leaving your mouth were relentless and anyone walking past your\noffice would definitely be able to hear you. </p><p>Yoongi huffed as he pulled out of you\nwithout warning. You whined, \u2018I\u2019ll be quiet, please, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 You stammered\nbetween breaths, desperate for him to resume your stimulation. </p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything as he guided you\nup, his erection red and pulsing against his stomach. He sat on one of the\nchairs to your desk and turned you around to guide you on to him, your back to\nhis chest, \u2018it\u2019s just a precaution, sweetie.\u2019 He whispered against your ear as\nyou sunk onto him and he held his hand over your mouth, the other holding onto\nyour hip to help your movements. You moaned as his length filled you but his\nhand muffled the sound. You wanted to hold on to something, anything, but your\nwrists were still bound together in front of you.</p><p>You moved up and down his length,\nswirling your hips to provoke the hisses from his mouth. You couldn\u2019t see him\nbut you knew he was straining from making any sounds and your whimpers were\nsubsiding with the hold he had over your mouth. </p><p>It was thrilling really, doing this in\nyour office. The door was unlocked and the walls were thin; anyone could walk\nin and see you or walk past and hear you; not to mention, Namjoon\u2019s office was\nonly next door. Yet, none of these thoughts stopped you from grinding on him,\nthrowing your head back to rest against his shoulder and feeling his heavy breathing\nagainst you. </p><p>His hand that was formerly on your hip\ntravelled up your side and under your shirt to cup your breast underneath your\nbra \u2013 a lace one you\u2019d worn in hopes of getting some action. He massaged it,\npinching your nipple with his forefinger and thumb occasionally whilst he began\nslowly kissing your neck, starting out with pecks before leaving a trail of\nopen mouthed kisses. </p><p>You felt him throb inside you and you\nknew it wouldn\u2019t be long before he reached his climax. You knew you were\nnearing yours but needed that extra push; you went to reach to touch yourself\nbut you remembered you were bound and unable to do so. You deflated in Yoongi\u2019s\nhold, sighing and whining at the revelation.</p><p>Sensing this, Yoongi whispered in your\near, \u2018you want to touch yourself don\u2019t you baby?\u2019</p><p>You nodded vehemently; his hand clasped\nover your mouth preventing you from showing your affirmation verbally. </p><p>\u2018If you hadn\u2019t tied <i>me</i> up last time, you\u2019d be able to touch yourself right now,\nwouldn\u2019t you?\u2019 He chastised you and you grinded your hips in response. His hand\nthat was fondling your breast moved to hold your hip in a bid to halt your\nmovements and he emitted a moan from his throat signifying your grinding had\nhad an effect on him. </p><p>He removed his hand from your mouth and\nyou panted relentlessly, \u2018please, Yoongi,\u2019 you breathed. You weren\u2019t sure what\nyou were begging for exactly, you just needed release; you were so close. </p><p>\u2018Can you promise me you\u2019ll be quiet?\u2019 </p><p>You couldn\u2019t promise him you would, but\nyou nodded anyway, desperate for him to do something. </p><p>\u2018Hmm? Use your words baby,\u2019 he spoke\nlowly before continuing leaving kisses along your neck and shoulder. </p><p>\u2018I promise. Please, make me cum Yoongi.\nTouch me, anything, please.\u2019 You pleaded through breaths, your eyebrows furrowed\nand your body jolting as he thrusted into you. </p><p>\u2018Good girl,\u2019 he whispered into your ear\nbefore his hand reached down to your core and he began to circle your clit with\nhis forefinger and middle finger. Your eyes rolled back at the feeling and your\nmouth was agape but no sound thankfully came out, you were too caught up in the\nfeeling to make a sound. </p><p>His thrusts picked up speed and his\nfingers worked your clit in time to his thrusts; the sound of his breathing\nbecame louder and faster and you knew he was close. The pooling in your stomach\nsignified you were close too. </p><p>Before long, you were jolting against him\nand biting your lip to prevent yourself from screaming out his name as your\norgasm washed over you. A moan escaped your lips but Yoongi didn\u2019t seem to\nnotice as he concentrated on chasing his own high. </p><p>You felt raw and sensitive as he\ncontinued thrusting into you, riding out your high but you moved your hips\nweakly in an attempt to help him. There was a pause and a strained groan as you\nfelt him release into the condom before relaxing into the chair as he caught\nhis breath. </p><p>The room was filled with each of your\npanting breaths as you adjusted yourself so he was no longer inside you \u2013 a\nwhimper escaping your lips at the absence. He reached his arms around your body\nto unbuckle the belt from your wrists and you moved them in circles,\nfamiliarising yourself with the freedom. </p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 Yoongi murmured, placing his\narms around your waist as you both recovered. </p><p>You nodded, \u2018yeah.\u2019 You smiled, turning\nto peck him on the lips. The position was intimate \u2013 you\u2019d never cuddled each\nother before, and to do so after sex was definitely unexpected.</p><p>You rested against him for mere moments\nwhen you suddenly became conscious of everyone outside your office \u2013 anyone\ncould have heard or figured out what was going on. You removed yourself from\nhis hold and stood up, adjusting your clothing and locating your underwear to\nput them on. From the noise behind you, you could tell Yoongi was doing the\nsame, buckling his belt and clearing his throat. </p><p>You turned to face him, suddenly awkward\nand unsure of what everything meant as he looked at you questioningly. He\nhesitantly took the few steps separating you from him, \u2018I needed that.\u2019 He\nsmirked and you rolled your eyes but bit your lip all the same, \u2018we\u2019d better\nget back to work. I\u2019ll see you in the meeting later yeah?\u2019</p><p>The meeting. You\u2019d forgotten about that.\nYou\u2019d received an email from Namjoon the night before informing you that\nSeokjin had called for a meeting with you, Namjoon, Yoongi and Jungkook to\ndiscuss plans of action. You\u2019d been dreading it and Yoongi had definitely taken\nyour mind off of it. Until now.</p><p>You nodded as he cupped your face and\npressed a kiss to your lips before leaving your office, acting as nonchalant as\npossible. </p><p>You\u2019d just inspected your office,\nensuring there was no evidence of what happened when not even a minute had\npassed before you heard a knock at your door. Your heart beat much faster than\nnormal and you silently prayed it was Yoongi again.</p><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 you called out, your voice\ntimid. </p><p>The door opened and Jimin and Tae walked\nin. You were conscious of the smell of sex in the air and the imperfections in\nyour hair and make up as a result. They, however, seemed none the wiser. </p><p>\u2018H-hi,\u2019 you smiled, your face a bright\nshade of red.</p><p>\u2018We just wanted to let you know how the\ninterview with Lee Jisoo went.\u2019 Tae beamed at you as he and Jimin each took a\nseat opposite you. You winced as you realised Jimin was sitting on the chair\nyou and Yoongi were on mere minutes before. </p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 You kept your replies short,\nworried that the shakiness in your voice would reveal too much. </p><p>\u2018So, it went really well, we thought. She\nanswered a lot of the questions we had prepared \u2013\u2019 Jimin began.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, so we asked what drew her to the\nrole for her new movie and how she thinks people will react to it \u2026\u2019 Tae\ninterrupted.</p><p>They spoke but you were too busy looking\naround the room as something in the back of your mind was alerting you that you\nhad forgotten something. You were sure there was some evidence of what you and\nYoongi had just done. Jimin and Tae were friends of yours and they would be\nunlikely to get you in trouble but sex in your office was a level of\nunprofessionalism you were not willing to advocate. Your eyes scanned the parts\nof Jimin\u2019s chair that he wasn\u2019t covering but inwardly sighed in relief as you\nfound nothing.</p><p>Perhaps you were being paranoid. </p><p>\u2018\u2026she really liked our idea for the\nphotoshoot so there was no trouble with that. The outfits looked amazing on\nher, Hoseok did such a good job\u2026\u2019 Jimin continued. </p><p>You were unsure why they had come to\nvisit you with such information. Perhaps that was why you were paranoid. They\nwould typically just send you the finished product for you and Namjoon to\napprove of before it went for print. So the fact that they were telling you\nthis made you think if there was another reason they were here and that\u2019s why\nyour eyes continued searching around the room.</p><p>\u2018Y/N?\u2019 Tae\u2019s voice caught your attention\nand you looked at him like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>You cleared your throat, \u2018sorry?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you okay? Your eyes keep moving\naround?\u2019 He questioned.</p><p>\u2018Oh, I think I\u2019ve got something in my\neye, sorry.\u2019 You laughed awkwardly and blinked a few times before going to rub\nyour eye to make your story more convincing.</p><p>The way Tae and Jimin looked at you\nemphasised you were not at all convincing. But they continued the conversation\nall the same. </p><p>It was as you had brought your hand away\nfrom your eye when the trash can next to your desk captured your attention.\nInside it, was a poorly discarded cum filled condom. You had never felt more\nanger at Yoongi than you had in that moment. You quickly averted your gaze,\nhoping Jimin and Tae wouldn\u2019t look there too. </p><p>It was apparent that they had not yet\nnoticed but the way you tapped your foot impatiently in a habit of fear was\nlikely to make them even more suspicious. Jimin was speaking but your mind was\ntoo preoccupied to acknowledge what he was saying. Tae was the object of your\nfocus as his eyes wandered around the room, taking in the details of your\noffice. He could look in the trash can at any moment. </p><p>You quickly grabbed a few tissues from\nthe tissue box on your desk and held them to your face in a feigned sneeze.\nYour attempt was poor but you excused yourself anyway and put the tissues in\nthe bin quickly covering the condom. The relief you felt in that moment was\nimmense. </p><p>They hadn\u2019t noticed. </p><p>You relaxed and began listening to them\nproperly. This time, Tae was speaking, \u2018we were able to get her comment on the\nrecent scandal between her and Kwon Joon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s brilliant!\u2019 You exclaimed,\nbecause it really was. The scandal was recent and you knew a large readership\nwill be attracted if the magazine was to publish it. A large readership may\nalso help the current situation and prevent any terminations of employees. You\nwere beaming.</p><p>\u2018It is.\u2019 Jimin sighed, \u2018but we found out\ntoday that Retro already interviewed Lee Jisoo and she spoke to them about it.\nThey published it today and everyone went crazy for it. When we publish it, it\nwould already be old news.\u2019 </p><p>You instantly deflated, your hopes dashed\nin a few sentences. </p><p>\u2018We just wanted to let you know so you\nand Namjoon can decide whether the article should include that bit. I wrote two\n\u2013 one with and one without so I can email them to you both now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019d be good. Thanks guys.\u2019 You smiled\nas they stood to leave. </p><p>Just as they were leaving, Tae turned\nback to you, \u2018did you do something in here?\u2019</p><p>You seemed to choke on air as you\nspluttered, \u2018what? What do you mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Something just seems different, the\npaint maybe?\u2019</p><p>You shook your head, \u2018no. No difference.\u2019\n</p><p>He shrugged, \u2018huh.\u2019 Before saying goodbye\nand leaving you to alert Namjoon of the bad news.</p><p>No, there was nothing different about\nyour office, really. Except for the fact it had now been christened by yours\nand Yoongi\u2019s antics. As well as the filing cabinet that had contained the\nemployee\u2019s files Yoongi once asked for was now empty, though this was a change\nyou had yet to notice yourself. \u00a0</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>You, Namjoon, Jungkook and Yoongi were\ncurrently in the elevator going up to Seokjin\u2019s office. You had told Namjoon\nabout what Jimin and Tae had informed you and he looked defeated, because you\nnow had to inform Seokjin of your progress. It was the end of the day and\neveryone else was going or had already gone home but now was the only time\nSeokjin could hold a meeting.</p><p>To say you were nervous was an\nunderstatement; you were unsure of what the current situation would mean. You\nthought there would still be time but it seemed that decisions were going to\nhave to be made soon.</p><p>No one said anything in the elevator,\nthough you were extremely aware of Yoongi standing next to you and his hand\ntrailing patterns lightly along your side. Namjoon and Jungkook were stood in\nfront of you both so could not see but that did not eliminate the possibility\nof one of them turning around. Fortunately, the doors opened and you were all\nwelcomed into Seokjin\u2019s office as he greeted you all before anyone could see\nYoongi\u2019s actions. </p><p>\u2018I just wanted a quick meeting to find\nout how everything is going and if you two wanted to share any thing you\u2019ve\nfound.\u2019 Seokjin addressed Yoongi and Jungkook and you stared at Yoongi who\nseemed unphased by your presence as he gave his answer.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve found numerous possibilities for a\nreduction in outgoings that could help the department\u2019s economic position.\u2019 He\nhanded Seokjin a small binder filled with paper, \u2018they\u2019re in there. We\nsuggested long term changes such as ones to the magazine itself which could\nprove cost effective. But there are some changes that could be made which would\nhave immediate effect.\u2019</p><p>Seokjin briefly looked through the binder\nand nodded his head, \u2018I think changes that take immediate effect would be more\nbeneficial to us. What ideas did you have in mind?\u2019</p><p>Jungkook took a deep breath, \u2018we looked\nthrough employee files and spoke to Namjoon about the possibility of employee\ntermination. We agreed that offering redundancy may be in our best interests\nfor the workers though.\u2019</p><p>Your heart began to race in anger. They\nhad access to the employee files? Namjoon knew about this? </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help yourself from asking\nquestions, \u2018how did you get the employee files?\u2019 you addressed them both but\nyour glare was fixated on Yoongi.</p><p>It was Namjoon who answered though, \u2018I gave\nthe files to them. They needed them to do their job, Y/N.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You spoke to them about redundancies?\u2019\nyou couldn\u2019t hide the feeling of being betrayed in your voice.</p><p>\u2018We just needed to think about what\u2019s\nbest for the department.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But why didn\u2019t you talk to me?\u2019 you\nbarely whispered. You thought you and Namjoon were a team and you\u2019d be\nincluded, especially in circumstances like this. </p><p>Seokjin could sense the tension and spoke\nbefore Namjoon could, \u2018Y/N, I trust you\u2019re working <i>with </i>Yoongi and Jungkook, and not against them.\u2019</p><p>You winced, forgetting Seokjin was in the\nroom and that he would not approve of your lack of professionalism.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s been a pleasure to work with,\nSeokjin.\u2019 Yoongi assured Seokjin and you looked up to see him avoiding your\ngaze.</p><p>You were grateful for his input despite the\ncurrent anger you felt towards him and decided it was best to keep quiet for\nwhatever was left of the meeting. Fortunately for you, it wasn\u2019t much longer.</p><p>\u2018Good. I won\u2019t be receiving another financial report until the end of the week so depending on that, we\u2019ll perhaps wait to see how the next issue goes before kicking things into gear. Thanks guys.\u2019 Seokjin dismissed you all. </p><p>You got up quickly and raced to the\nelevator, hoping it would come and you could go down to your office before\nanyone else could get in with you. But the world was not on your side as all\nthree men, Yoongi, Namjoon and Jungkook got in with you. </p><p>You stood in the corner and was unable to\nlook any of them in the eye; you felt awkward and not sure what to say or how\nto feel. </p><p>\u2018Y/N, it was a brief conversation, I\ndidn\u2019t think it had much importance to talk to you about.\u2019 Namjoon spoke\ngently.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019 You offered him a weak smile.\nNo decisions were actually made and as you stood their rationalising it, you\nrealised it was Yoongi you were upset with. You felt, with what was going on\nbetween the two of you, he could be more honest with you.</p><p>The elevator got to your floor and you\nfound retreat in the office, the others bidding you goodbye as they collected\ntheir things to leave. You sat in your chair and took a deep breath, closing\nyour eyes and leaning back in your chair. You had a habit of pushing the\nproblem with the company to the back of your mind \u2013 you didn\u2019t want anything\nbad to happen \u2013 so to be met with reality like this was too much.</p><p>The door opened and you didn\u2019t even need\nto open your eyes to know it was Yoongi who had the confidence to walk in to\nyour office without knocking. </p><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 he asked and you opened\nyour eyes to see he had sat in one of the chairs opposite you. He was sat in\nthe chair you fucked on hours before and you knew, unlike Jimin, Yoongi had sat\nthere deliberately. </p><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me what was going\non?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I knew you were not going to give me the\nfiles so I went to Namjoon instead. No matter what is going on between us, I\nstill have a job to do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, and that includes keeping me\ninformed. I need to know what\u2019s going on.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What? So you can complain like always?\u2019\nhe spat.</p><p>\u2018I do not complain, I simply want you to\nhave enough decency to think of the employees as people \u2013 you can\u2019t just fire\nthem without thinking how it may affect them.\u2019 Your voice was raised and you\nwere grateful everyone else had gone home.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing and you know\nit. I\u2019m here to make suggestions for all of us to come to conclusions but\nyou\u2019re not making this easy. You\u2019re acting like a child and being completely\nunprofessional. I mean I had to lie to Seokjin up there for you. Do you really\nthink you\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with when you disagree with everything I\ndo? No, you haven\u2019t \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You shouldn\u2019t have stuck up for me then,\nshould you?\u2019 you glared at him. \u00a0</p><p>He went to hold your hand across your\ndesk but you placed your hands in your lap to prevent him from doing so. \u2018I\ndidn\u2019t want you to get in trouble with Seokjin, cos we all know you would\nhave.\u2019 </p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything and just crossed\nyour arms, looking anywhere but at him. There was a slight pause before he\nspoke, \u2018stop being a brat.\u2019 He spoke softly and playfully and you were sure you\ncould see a hint of smile on his face. He was trying to lighten the mood, but\nyou proved difficult, like always.</p><p>\u2018Leave me alone Yoongi.\u2019</p><p>He sighed before standing up, \u2018you\u2019re\nmaking this so much harder than it needs to be right now.\u2019 He said, his voice\ntired and defeated. You found yourself unable to conjure a reply and only\nwatched him as he picked up his things and went into the elevator, the doors\nclosing behind him. </p></p>",

Every year, Couture threw parties for each holiday &ndash; the Couture\n&lsquo;birthday&rsquo;, Halloween, Christmas, New Year&rsquo;s and the like. Halloween was only less\nthan a month away so the party was being planned but that was all you knew;\nonly the heads of each department &ndash; so in your case, Namjoon &ndash; were involved in\nplanning to keep it a surprise for everyone else. Last years was massive, it\nwas held at Octagon; a club that was very expensive and very hard to get in to\nand many celebrities &ndash; who are always invited &ndash;<i> actually </i>showed up last year. </p><p>Hoseok, being the head of his department,\nwas now subject to all of your interrogations. </p><p>He shook his head, &lsquo;you know it&rsquo;s a\nsurprise!&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Oh please give us a hint!&rsquo; Tae pouted,\n&lsquo;I just need to know whether to get my hopes up for a repeat of last year.&rsquo;</p><p>Hoseok remained adamant, &lsquo;no guys, you&rsquo;ll\njust have to wait and see!&rsquo; He laughed before walking towards the elevator to\ngo back to his floor. Your eyes followed him as the elevator doors opened and\nyou saw Yoongi step out before Hoseok stepped in; the two offering one another\na quick greeting before your eyes darted back to Jimin and Tae who were still\ntheorising about the party.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t spoken to or seen Yoongi since\nFriday. You were still angry at him for leaving you high and dry &ndash; sure, you\nfinished yourself off but it would&rsquo;ve been better if he had helped you; not\nthat you&rsquo;d ever tell him that.</p><p>&lsquo;&hellip;maybe J Lo will be there?&rsquo; Tae gasped.</p><p>&lsquo;&hellip;or they will have a free bar again?&rsquo;\nJimin beamed.</p><p>You hummed, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I feel like\nthere&rsquo;s too much going on for it to be <i>exactly</i>\nlike last year&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Like what?&rsquo; Tae interrupted and then you\nrealised your mistake. </p><p>With the cuts, you can only imagine how\nplanning a Halloween party was the least of Namjoon&rsquo;s problems but Tae and\nJimin were still in the dark about it all, everyone was. </p><p>&lsquo;Uh, you know like in the celeb world,\nmovies and music and stuff, not many celebrities will probably come.&rsquo; You tried\nyour best to recover and thankfully Jimin and Tae seemed none the wiser to your\nawful cover up.</p><p>&lsquo;True but then <i>last </i>year, there was &ndash;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Y/N? Can I speak to you in your office\nfor a moment?&rsquo; you heard a voice behind you and turned around to see Yoongi.\nYou glared as though on instinct before composing yourself in front of Tae and\nJimin.</p><p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; you smiled through gritted\nteeth before turning to the people you actually wanted to speak to, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see\nyou guys later.&rsquo;</p><p>They said goodbye and you walked to your\noffice, Yoongi trailing closely behind.</p><p>You were surprised Yoongi had initiated\nthe conversation, you wondered if maybe he was going to apologise for Friday.\nYou took a deep breath as you held the door open to your office and closed it\nafter Yoongi had walked in after you.</p><p>You crossed your arms and faced him, &lsquo;so,\nare you going to apolo &ndash;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You need to be more careful.&rsquo; He\ninterrupted you.</p><p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You nearly blew it with Jimin and\nTaehyung out there. We can&rsquo;t let anyone know about the cuts and you nearly told\nthem. Have you told them already? Have you told anyone?&rsquo;</p><p><i>Oh.\nSo this was why he actually wanted to speak to you. But then, why did you feel\nlike he meant something else?</i></p><p>&lsquo;Were you listening to our conversation?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I may have overheard things; I<i> did </i>have to walk past you to get to my\ndesk. But that doesn&rsquo;t answer my question.&rsquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes, &lsquo;no, I haven&rsquo;t told\nanyone and I&rsquo;m not going to. About <i>anything</i>.&rsquo;</p><p>And you meant <i>anything</i>. You did not want anyone knowing about yours and Yoongi&rsquo;s\nrendezvous on Friday. &nbsp;</p><p>He smirked, &lsquo;are you ashamed of what\nhappened?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a kid, I always know what I&rsquo;m\ndoing so no, I&rsquo;m not ashamed. But I must break the news that it&rsquo;s not going to\nhappen again. For your information, I finished myself off after you left and I\nthink I&rsquo;m going to continue with that rather than,&rsquo; you gestured to you and\nhim, &lsquo;<i>this</i>. I did a better job myself\nanyway.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo; He glared at you, tight\nlipped, though you saw the hint of a slight smirk. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a shame, really.&rsquo; He\nfeigned a sigh, &lsquo;I was going to apologise to you for leaving you there. I\nthought about it over the weekend and I know I would have hated to be left\ndenied one of nature&rsquo;s finest pleasures.&rsquo; You scoffed but he continued, &lsquo;I was\ngoing to offer a redemption round but if you&rsquo;d rather do it yourself &ndash;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;W &ndash; wait, a redemption round?&rsquo; you\nspluttered.</p><p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure no one would miss me for\na while if I was to,&rsquo; he walked towards you as he looked you up and down, his\neyes filled with lust and you went weak at the knees, &lsquo;finish what I started.&rsquo;</p><p>You watched him through hooded eyes as he\npressed a few kisses across your shoulder before kissing your neck. </p><p>This was dangerous. The only thing\nseparating the two of you from the rest of the office was glass. You didn&rsquo;t\nwant anyone to know and this was a huge risk, you knew that, yet you didn&rsquo;t\nstop Yoongi as his hands held your waist and caressed your sides before\nreaching down to cup your ass. </p><p>Your eyes fluttered closed as his lips\nfound the sweet spot on your neck but all too quickly he pulled away and walked\ntowards the door. </p><p>&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; You quizzed,\ndisappointed at the sudden lack of contact.</p><p>&lsquo;You said it wouldn&rsquo;t happen again and\nI&rsquo;m just following your request.&rsquo; He held his hands up in defence and you knew\nhe was teasing you. </p><p>You shouldn&rsquo;t give in. You were stronger\nthan that. And doing it in your office? There were too many risks.</p><p>&lsquo;Well, I, uh, I suppose one more time\ncouldn&rsquo;t hurt.&rsquo; Your voice betrayed you; releasing statements before your brain\ncould even fathom them.</p><p>Yoongi&rsquo;s smile was devious and you all of\na sudden didn&rsquo;t feel so betrayed by your mouth anymore.</p><p>He was mere centimetres away from you\nagain, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve got to be quiet though, can you do that for me?&rsquo; </p><p>You nodded as you grabbed his neck and\npulled him to you, connecting your lips and forgetting about the mass of people\nsat at their desks behind your door. </p><p>He kissed you back; your kisses were open\nmouthed and a constant fight for control yet the way he bent to hold the backs\nof your thighs, lifting you up to straddle his waist and press you against your\ndesk had you acquiescing to his power in seconds. </p><p>His lips trailed down your neck as you\nperched on the edge of your desk, lifting your hips to press against his\ngrowing bulge as he stood in between your parted legs. </p><p>&lsquo;You must have been so angry with me,\nhuh?&rsquo; He murmured, his kisses sloppy against your neck. </p><p>You hummed, focusing on the way his hand\ntrailed up your leg and under your skirt, making patterns across your inner\nthigh causing you to shiver at the contact.</p><p>&lsquo;Angry at how I left you there, all wet,\nhuh?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;So angry,&rsquo; you whispered, your eyes\nclosed and eyebrows furrowed as his fingers inched closer and closer to where\nyou needed him. </p><p>&lsquo;You were so wet, I can still remember\nit,&rsquo; he spoke softly, &lsquo;are you as wet for me now as you were then?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;God, yes Yoongi.&rsquo; Your voice was shaky.</p><p>You wanted to yell at him, tell him off\nfor treating it like a game when he left you there. But the memory of Friday\nwas in your head and you wanted more. You felt him use two fingers to push your\npanties aside and your breathing hitched in your throat as you knew you were\ngoing to get what you wanted. </p><p>Slowly, his fingers ran along your folds,\n&lsquo;so fucking wet,&rsquo; he chuckled darkly before the two digits entered you. You bit\nyour lip to prevent yourself from crying out as your head fell against his\nshoulder and his fingers swirled around your walls. You were a mess already and\nhe had only just begun. </p><p>He pumped his fingers in and out of you\nwhilst he continued his assault on your neck, filling the room with a\ncombination of the lewd sounds. You were panting, your hands clutching to the\nedge of your desk and trying your best not to make a noise as he established a\nrhythm. But all too quickly, he removed his fingers from you and you couldn&rsquo;t\nstop a whine leaving your mouth. &lsquo;Y-yoongi, please I &ndash;&rsquo;</p><p>He hushed you by placing his two fingers,\ncoated in your juices, in your mouth which you sucked clean without hesitation\nas he watched, &lsquo;I bet you taste just as sweet as I remember.&rsquo;</p><p>You smirked up at him, opening your legs\na little wider as an invitation causing your skirt to bunch up around your\nwaist but he shook his head, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in charge here.&rsquo; He spoke lowly as he began\nto unbuckle his belt, &lsquo;remember that trick you pulled on me last time?&rsquo; He\nasked as he grabbed your wrists and bound them together with his belt, &lsquo;I\ndidn&rsquo;t appreciate it, baby. So, you&rsquo;ll have a taste of your own medicine.&rsquo; </p><p>In that moment, you knew he wanted to\nexert his authority. It explained why he left you to finish the job last time;\nhe was punishing you for taking control and tying him up. Despite his pettiness,\nyou were insanely turned on and no part of you wanted to protest.</p><p>He held your wrists above your head with\none of his hands, with the other he removed your panties and then began palming\nhimself through his trousers; you began struggling in your restraints: you were\nthrobbing and it seemed he was not going to relieve you any time soon. </p><p>He shook his head, &lsquo;no touching.&rsquo; </p><p>You threw your head back in frustration\nas he chuckled, removing his hand from his crotch to his back pocket and\npulling out a condom packet, ripping it open with his teeth. &lsquo;I came prepared\nthis time,&rsquo; he winked at you as he rolled the condom along his length. </p><p>You licked your lips at the sight, &lsquo;please\nYoongi,&rsquo; you sighed, &lsquo;let me touch you.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I said no touching.&rsquo; His voice was stern\nand only contributed to the wetness between your thighs. </p><p>He positioned himself by your entrance\nand your breath hitched in your throat in anticipation; he brushed the tip\nalong your folds and you moaned instantly at the feeling. </p><p>He laughed breathily at your reaction,\n&lsquo;you&rsquo;re a mess already babygirl.&rsquo;</p><p>He finally entered you, releasing a low\ngroan you could tell he had tried to restrain as you moaned along with him. </p><p>His head rested in the crook of your neck\nas he picked up the pace, moving in and out of you at a steady rhythm. Strings\nof whimpers and moans left your mouth and it was apparent you had forgotten the\nthin walls of your office, but Yoongi hadn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be quiet or I&rsquo;ll have to\nstop.&rsquo; He spoke and you bit your lip in a bid to do as you were told.</p><p>But the pleasure was too much, as was the\ndull ache that was forming in your arms having been held up by Yoongi for too\nlong. The moans leaving your mouth were relentless and anyone walking past your\noffice would definitely be able to hear you. </p><p>Yoongi huffed as he pulled out of you\nwithout warning. You whined, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be quiet, please, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rsquo; You stammered\nbetween breaths, desperate for him to resume your stimulation. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t say anything as he guided you\nup, his erection red and pulsing against his stomach. He sat on one of the\nchairs to your desk and turned you around to guide you on to him, your back to\nhis chest, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just a precaution, sweetie.&rsquo; He whispered against your ear as\nyou sunk onto him and he held his hand over your mouth, the other holding onto\nyour hip to help your movements. You moaned as his length filled you but his\nhand muffled the sound. You wanted to hold on to something, anything, but your\nwrists were still bound together in front of you.</p><p>You moved up and down his length,\nswirling your hips to provoke the hisses from his mouth. You couldn&rsquo;t see him\nbut you knew he was straining from making any sounds and your whimpers were\nsubsiding with the hold he had over your mouth. </p><p>It was thrilling really, doing this in\nyour office. The door was unlocked and the walls were thin; anyone could walk\nin and see you or walk past and hear you; not to mention, Namjoon&rsquo;s office was\nonly next door. Yet, none of these thoughts stopped you from grinding on him,\nthrowing your head back to rest against his shoulder and feeling his heavy breathing\nagainst you. </p><p>His hand that was formerly on your hip\ntravelled up your side and under your shirt to cup your breast underneath your\nbra &ndash; a lace one you&rsquo;d worn in hopes of getting some action. He massaged it,\npinching your nipple with his forefinger and thumb occasionally whilst he began\nslowly kissing your neck, starting out with pecks before leaving a trail of\nopen mouthed kisses. </p><p>You felt him throb inside you and you\nknew it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before he reached his climax. You knew you were\nnearing yours but needed that extra push; you went to reach to touch yourself\nbut you remembered you were bound and unable to do so. You deflated in Yoongi&rsquo;s\nhold, sighing and whining at the revelation.</p><p>Sensing this, Yoongi whispered in your\near, &lsquo;you want to touch yourself don&rsquo;t you baby?&rsquo;</p><p>You nodded vehemently; his hand clasped\nover your mouth preventing you from showing your affirmation verbally. </p><p>&lsquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t tied <i>me</i> up last time, you&rsquo;d be able to touch yourself right now,\nwouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; He chastised you and you grinded your hips in response. His hand\nthat was fondling your breast moved to hold your hip in a bid to halt your\nmovements and he emitted a moan from his throat signifying your grinding had\nhad an effect on him. </p><p>He removed his hand from your mouth and\nyou panted relentlessly, &lsquo;please, Yoongi,&rsquo; you breathed. You weren&rsquo;t sure what\nyou were begging for exactly, you just needed release; you were so close. </p><p>&lsquo;Can you promise me you&rsquo;ll be quiet?&rsquo; </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t promise him you would, but\nyou nodded anyway, desperate for him to do something. </p><p>&lsquo;Hmm? Use your words baby,&rsquo; he spoke\nlowly before continuing leaving kisses along your neck and shoulder. </p><p>&lsquo;I promise. Please, make me cum Yoongi.\nTouch me, anything, please.&rsquo; You pleaded through breaths, your eyebrows furrowed\nand your body jolting as he thrusted into you. </p><p>&lsquo;Good girl,&rsquo; he whispered into your ear\nbefore his hand reached down to your core and he began to circle your clit with\nhis forefinger and middle finger. Your eyes rolled back at the feeling and your\nmouth was agape but no sound thankfully came out, you were too caught up in the\nfeeling to make a sound. </p><p>His thrusts picked up speed and his\nfingers worked your clit in time to his thrusts; the sound of his breathing\nbecame louder and faster and you knew he was close. The pooling in your stomach\nsignified you were close too. </p><p>Before long, you were jolting against him\nand biting your lip to prevent yourself from screaming out his name as your\norgasm washed over you. A moan escaped your lips but Yoongi didn&rsquo;t seem to\nnotice as he concentrated on chasing his own high. </p><p>You felt raw and sensitive as he\ncontinued thrusting into you, riding out your high but you moved your hips\nweakly in an attempt to help him. There was a pause and a strained groan as you\nfelt him release into the condom before relaxing into the chair as he caught\nhis breath. </p><p>The room was filled with each of your\npanting breaths as you adjusted yourself so he was no longer inside you &ndash; a\nwhimper escaping your lips at the absence. He reached his arms around your body\nto unbuckle the belt from your wrists and you moved them in circles,\nfamiliarising yourself with the freedom. </p><p>&lsquo;You okay?&rsquo; Yoongi murmured, placing his\narms around your waist as you both recovered. </p><p>You nodded, &lsquo;yeah.&rsquo; You smiled, turning\nto peck him on the lips. The position was intimate &ndash; you&rsquo;d never cuddled each\nother before, and to do so after sex was definitely unexpected.</p><p>You rested against him for mere moments\nwhen you suddenly became conscious of everyone outside your office &ndash; anyone\ncould have heard or figured out what was going on. You removed yourself from\nhis hold and stood up, adjusting your clothing and locating your underwear to\nput them on. From the noise behind you, you could tell Yoongi was doing the\nsame, buckling his belt and clearing his throat. </p><p>You turned to face him, suddenly awkward\nand unsure of what everything meant as he looked at you questioningly. He\nhesitantly took the few steps separating you from him, &lsquo;I needed that.&rsquo; He\nsmirked and you rolled your eyes but bit your lip all the same, &lsquo;we&rsquo;d better\nget back to work. I&rsquo;ll see you in the meeting later yeah?&rsquo;</p><p>The meeting. You&rsquo;d forgotten about that.\nYou&rsquo;d received an email from Namjoon the night before informing you that\nSeokjin had called for a meeting with you, Namjoon, Yoongi and Jungkook to\ndiscuss plans of action. You&rsquo;d been dreading it and Yoongi had definitely taken\nyour mind off of it. Until now.</p><p>You nodded as he cupped your face and\npressed a kiss to your lips before leaving your office, acting as nonchalant as\npossible. </p><p>You&rsquo;d just inspected your office,\nensuring there was no evidence of what happened when not even a minute had\npassed before you heard a knock at your door. Your heart beat much faster than\nnormal and you silently prayed it was Yoongi again.</p><p>&lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; you called out, your voice\ntimid. </p><p>The door opened and Jimin and Tae walked\nin. You were conscious of the smell of sex in the air and the imperfections in\nyour hair and make up as a result. They, however, seemed none the wiser. </p><p>&lsquo;H-hi,&rsquo; you smiled, your face a bright\nshade of red.</p><p>&lsquo;We just wanted to let you know how the\ninterview with Lee Jisoo went.&rsquo; Tae beamed at you as he and Jimin each took a\nseat opposite you. You winced as you realised Jimin was sitting on the chair\nyou and Yoongi were on mere minutes before. </p><p>&lsquo;Of course.&rsquo; You kept your replies short,\nworried that the shakiness in your voice would reveal too much. </p><p>&lsquo;So, it went really well, we thought. She\nanswered a lot of the questions we had prepared &ndash;&rsquo; Jimin began.</p><p>&lsquo;Yeah, so we asked what drew her to the\nrole for her new movie and how she thinks people will react to it &hellip;&rsquo; Tae\ninterrupted.</p><p>They spoke but you were too busy looking\naround the room as something in the back of your mind was alerting you that you\nhad forgotten something. You were sure there was some evidence of what you and\nYoongi had just done. Jimin and Tae were friends of yours and they would be\nunlikely to get you in trouble but sex in your office was a level of\nunprofessionalism you were not willing to advocate. Your eyes scanned the parts\nof Jimin&rsquo;s chair that he wasn&rsquo;t covering but inwardly sighed in relief as you\nfound nothing.</p><p>Perhaps you were being paranoid. </p><p>&lsquo;&hellip;she really liked our idea for the\nphotoshoot so there was no trouble with that. The outfits looked amazing on\nher, Hoseok did such a good job&hellip;&rsquo; Jimin continued. </p><p>You were unsure why they had come to\nvisit you with such information. Perhaps that was why you were paranoid. They\nwould typically just send you the finished product for you and Namjoon to\napprove of before it went for print. So the fact that they were telling you\nthis made you think if there was another reason they were here and that&rsquo;s why\nyour eyes continued searching around the room.</p><p>&lsquo;Y/N?&rsquo; Tae&rsquo;s voice caught your attention\nand you looked at him like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>You cleared your throat, &lsquo;sorry?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Are you okay? Your eyes keep moving\naround?&rsquo; He questioned.</p><p>&lsquo;Oh, I think I&rsquo;ve got something in my\neye, sorry.&rsquo; You laughed awkwardly and blinked a few times before going to rub\nyour eye to make your story more convincing.</p><p>The way Tae and Jimin looked at you\nemphasised you were not at all convincing. But they continued the conversation\nall the same. </p><p>It was as you had brought your hand away\nfrom your eye when the trash can next to your desk captured your attention.\nInside it, was a poorly discarded cum filled condom. You had never felt more\nanger at Yoongi than you had in that moment. You quickly averted your gaze,\nhoping Jimin and Tae wouldn&rsquo;t look there too. </p><p>It was apparent that they had not yet\nnoticed but the way you tapped your foot impatiently in a habit of fear was\nlikely to make them even more suspicious. Jimin was speaking but your mind was\ntoo preoccupied to acknowledge what he was saying. Tae was the object of your\nfocus as his eyes wandered around the room, taking in the details of your\noffice. He could look in the trash can at any moment. </p><p>You quickly grabbed a few tissues from\nthe tissue box on your desk and held them to your face in a feigned sneeze.\nYour attempt was poor but you excused yourself anyway and put the tissues in\nthe bin quickly covering the condom. The relief you felt in that moment was\nimmense. </p><p>They hadn&rsquo;t noticed. </p><p>You relaxed and began listening to them\nproperly. This time, Tae was speaking, &lsquo;we were able to get her comment on the\nrecent scandal between her and Kwon Joon.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s brilliant!&rsquo; You exclaimed,\nbecause it really was. The scandal was recent and you knew a large readership\nwill be attracted if the magazine was to publish it. A large readership may\nalso help the current situation and prevent any terminations of employees. You\nwere beaming.</p><p>&lsquo;It is.&rsquo; Jimin sighed, &lsquo;but we found out\ntoday that Retro already interviewed Lee Jisoo and she spoke to them about it.\nThey published it today and everyone went crazy for it. When we publish it, it\nwould already be old news.&rsquo; </p><p>You instantly deflated, your hopes dashed\nin a few sentences. </p><p>&lsquo;We just wanted to let you know so you\nand Namjoon can decide whether the article should include that bit. I wrote two\n&ndash; one with and one without so I can email them to you both now.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;d be good. Thanks guys.&rsquo; You smiled\nas they stood to leave. </p><p>Just as they were leaving, Tae turned\nback to you, &lsquo;did you do something in here?&rsquo;</p><p>You seemed to choke on air as you\nspluttered, &lsquo;what? What do you mean?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Something just seems different, the\npaint maybe?&rsquo;</p><p>You shook your head, &lsquo;no. No difference.&rsquo;\n</p><p>He shrugged, &lsquo;huh.&rsquo; Before saying goodbye\nand leaving you to alert Namjoon of the bad news.</p><p>No, there was nothing different about\nyour office, really. Except for the fact it had now been christened by yours\nand Yoongi&rsquo;s antics. As well as the filing cabinet that had contained the\nemployee&rsquo;s files Yoongi once asked for was now empty, though this was a change\nyou had yet to notice yourself. &nbsp;</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>You, Namjoon, Jungkook and Yoongi were\ncurrently in the elevator going up to Seokjin&rsquo;s office. You had told Namjoon\nabout what Jimin and Tae had informed you and he looked defeated, because you\nnow had to inform Seokjin of your progress. It was the end of the day and\neveryone else was going or had already gone home but now was the only time\nSeokjin could hold a meeting.</p><p>To say you were nervous was an\nunderstatement; you were unsure of what the current situation would mean. You\nthought there would still be time but it seemed that decisions were going to\nhave to be made soon.</p><p>No one said anything in the elevator,\nthough you were extremely aware of Yoongi standing next to you and his hand\ntrailing patterns lightly along your side. Namjoon and Jungkook were stood in\nfront of you both so could not see but that did not eliminate the possibility\nof one of them turning around. Fortunately, the doors opened and you were all\nwelcomed into Seokjin&rsquo;s office as he greeted you all before anyone could see\nYoongi&rsquo;s actions. </p><p>&lsquo;I just wanted a quick meeting to find\nout how everything is going and if you two wanted to share any thing you&rsquo;ve\nfound.&rsquo; Seokjin addressed Yoongi and Jungkook and you stared at Yoongi who\nseemed unphased by your presence as he gave his answer.</p><p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve found numerous possibilities for a\nreduction in outgoings that could help the department&rsquo;s economic position.&rsquo; He\nhanded Seokjin a small binder filled with paper, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re in there. We\nsuggested long term changes such as ones to the magazine itself which could\nprove cost effective. But there are some changes that could be made which would\nhave immediate effect.&rsquo;</p><p>Seokjin briefly looked through the binder\nand nodded his head, &lsquo;I think changes that take immediate effect would be more\nbeneficial to us. What ideas did you have in mind?&rsquo;</p><p>Jungkook took a deep breath, &lsquo;we looked\nthrough employee files and spoke to Namjoon about the possibility of employee\ntermination. We agreed that offering redundancy may be in our best interests\nfor the workers though.&rsquo;</p><p>Your heart began to race in anger. They\nhad access to the employee files? Namjoon knew about this? </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help yourself from asking\nquestions, &lsquo;how did you get the employee files?&rsquo; you addressed them both but\nyour glare was fixated on Yoongi.</p><p>It was Namjoon who answered though, &lsquo;I gave\nthe files to them. They needed them to do their job, Y/N.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;You spoke to them about redundancies?&rsquo;\nyou couldn&rsquo;t hide the feeling of being betrayed in your voice.</p><p>&lsquo;We just needed to think about what&rsquo;s\nbest for the department.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you talk to me?&rsquo; you\nbarely whispered. You thought you and Namjoon were a team and you&rsquo;d be\nincluded, especially in circumstances like this. </p><p>Seokjin could sense the tension and spoke\nbefore Namjoon could, &lsquo;Y/N, I trust you&rsquo;re working <i>with </i>Yoongi and Jungkook, and not against them.&rsquo;</p><p>You winced, forgetting Seokjin was in the\nroom and that he would not approve of your lack of professionalism.</p><p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s been a pleasure to work with,\nSeokjin.&rsquo; Yoongi assured Seokjin and you looked up to see him avoiding your\ngaze.</p><p>You were grateful for his input despite the\ncurrent anger you felt towards him and decided it was best to keep quiet for\nwhatever was left of the meeting. Fortunately for you, it wasn&rsquo;t much longer.</p><p>&lsquo;Good. I won&rsquo;t be receiving another financial report until the end of the week so depending on that, we&rsquo;ll perhaps wait to see how the next issue goes before kicking things into gear. Thanks guys.&rsquo; Seokjin dismissed you all. </p><p>You got up quickly and raced to the\nelevator, hoping it would come and you could go down to your office before\nanyone else could get in with you. But the world was not on your side as all\nthree men, Yoongi, Namjoon and Jungkook got in with you. </p><p>You stood in the corner and was unable to\nlook any of them in the eye; you felt awkward and not sure what to say or how\nto feel. </p><p>&lsquo;Y/N, it was a brief conversation, I\ndidn&rsquo;t think it had much importance to talk to you about.&rsquo; Namjoon spoke\ngently.</p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rsquo; You offered him a weak smile.\nNo decisions were actually made and as you stood their rationalising it, you\nrealised it was Yoongi you were upset with. You felt, with what was going on\nbetween the two of you, he could be more honest with you.</p><p>The elevator got to your floor and you\nfound retreat in the office, the others bidding you goodbye as they collected\ntheir things to leave. You sat in your chair and took a deep breath, closing\nyour eyes and leaning back in your chair. You had a habit of pushing the\nproblem with the company to the back of your mind &ndash; you didn&rsquo;t want anything\nbad to happen &ndash; so to be met with reality like this was too much.</p><p>The door opened and you didn&rsquo;t even need\nto open your eyes to know it was Yoongi who had the confidence to walk in to\nyour office without knocking. </p><p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo; he asked and you opened\nyour eyes to see he had sat in one of the chairs opposite you. He was sat in\nthe chair you fucked on hours before and you knew, unlike Jimin, Yoongi had sat\nthere deliberately. </p><p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me what was going\non?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I knew you were not going to give me the\nfiles so I went to Namjoon instead. No matter what is going on between us, I\nstill have a job to do.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Yes, and that includes keeping me\ninformed. I need to know what&rsquo;s going on.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;What? So you can complain like always?&rsquo;\nhe spat.</p><p>&lsquo;I do not complain, I simply want you to\nhave enough decency to think of the employees as people &ndash; you can&rsquo;t just fire\nthem without thinking how it may affect them.&rsquo; Your voice was raised and you\nwere grateful everyone else had gone home.</p><p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m doing and you know\nit. I&rsquo;m here to make suggestions for all of us to come to conclusions but\nyou&rsquo;re not making this easy. You&rsquo;re acting like a child and being completely\nunprofessional. I mean I had to lie to Seokjin up there for you. Do you really\nthink you&rsquo;ve been a pleasure to work with when you disagree with everything I\ndo? No, you haven&rsquo;t &ndash;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have stuck up for me then,\nshould you?&rsquo; you glared at him. &nbsp;</p><p>He went to hold your hand across your\ndesk but you placed your hands in your lap to prevent him from doing so. &lsquo;I\ndidn&rsquo;t want you to get in trouble with Seokjin, cos we all know you would\nhave.&rsquo; </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t say anything and just crossed\nyour arms, looking anywhere but at him. There was a slight pause before he\nspoke, &lsquo;stop being a brat.&rsquo; He spoke softly and playfully and you were sure you\ncould see a hint of smile on his face. He was trying to lighten the mood, but\nyou proved difficult, like always.</p><p>&lsquo;Leave me alone Yoongi.&rsquo;</p><p>He sighed before standing up, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re\nmaking this so much harder than it needs to be right now.&rsquo; He said, his voice\ntired and defeated. You found yourself unable to conjure a reply and only\nwatched him as he picked up his things and went into the elevator, the doors\nclosing behind him. </p></p>",
