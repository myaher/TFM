        "body": "<p><b>A/N: </b>A couple of years ago, I made a dumb\u00a0<a href=\"http://apiratecalledav.tumblr.com/post/166125057751/and-on-todays-episode-of-work-is-so-painfully\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> about how work\nwas so boring that my brain went, \u201cHey, wouldn\u2019t it be hilarious and adorable\nif Arya and Gendry\u2019s kids called Sandor Clagane \u2018Uncle Sandy?\u2019\u201d </p><p>I got some requests to write a fan fic and I started a one shot\nbut never finished it<b>.</b>This is more the GOT universe, since it\u2019s fresher in my\nmind than ASOIF and there\u2019s more \u201croom to play\u201d with backstories and such. Plus\nRory McCann would totally own being \u201cUncle Sandy.\u201d ;)\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Please keep in mind that I haven\u2019t written anything in <b>forever</b> and this is way out of my comfort zone. <br/></p><p>It\u2019s Sandor\u2019s POV, so there\u2019s a good bit of language.<b><br/></b></p><hr><p>Sandor Clagane spots the daughters first. They\u2019re a fair\ndistance away and it\u2019s been well over a year since he\u2019s seen them, but he\u2019d\nknow them anywhere. They may have their father\u2019s hair and eyes, but otherwise,\nthey are entirely their mother. \u00a0The\nolder one must be seven or eight. \u00a0She\u2019s called Nell but that\u2019s short for\nsomething Sandor can\u2019t remember. And the younger one is\u2026 Brenna? Branna?\nBrenna. She looks about five. \u00a0</p><p>He looks around for their mother and father, the Girl and\nthe lad. It strikes him now how stupid it is that he still thinks of them that\nway. \u00a0The Girl would be about\ntwenty-eight by now and the lad is maybe thirty-three? They are long grown and\nhaven\u2019t been a girl and a lad for many years now. \u00a0</p><p>But\u2026 old habits. The Girl, the lad, Little Bird, the prince,\nthe king\u2026 the butcher\u2019s boy. \u00a0Titles,\nepithets, those are easier than names. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been for ages. Almost\nhis whole life, ever since\u2014</p><p><i>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t name\nthem, Sandor. You\u2019ll get too attached.\u201d </i></p><p>He clenches his teeth and shakes his head, needing to make\nthat sweet little voice quiet.</p><p> <i>\u201cIf you name them, it will make you sadder to lose them.\u201d</i></p><p>It\u2019s true. Death is sadder when they have names.</p><p>Having names can also make it harder to kill them. </p><p>He sees the lad first. Gendry. </p><p>The corner of Gendry\u2019s mouth turns upwards in surprise and\nhe makes his way over to Sandor. They don\u2019t speak; merely grasp each other\u2019s\nhands briefly and nod. \u00a0</p><p>Gendry turns in the direction to where his daughters are\nplaying. \u201cGirls?\u201d he calls, cupping his hands around his mouth to make himself\nlouder. \u201cCome see who\u2019s here!\u201d </p><p>The children\u2019s heads snap up in unison at the sound of their\nfather\u2019s voice. \u00a0\u201cOh, look!\u201d the older\none cries. Her voice echoes incredibly loud and shrill in the way only children\ncan manage. \u201cDo you know who that is? It\u2019s Uncle Sandy!\u201d</p><p>Sandor\u2019s mind goes blank for a moment, unable to comprehend\nwhat he just heard. \u00a0He feels an eye\ntwitch and his upper lip curl. He\u2019s not surprised they called him \u201cUncle.\u201d The\nlast time he was here, the Girl\u2014 either unwilling or unable to explain their affiliation\nto her daughters\u2014had referred to Sandor as her uncle. \u00a0But <i>Sandy</i>?\nUncle <i>Sandy</i>? Seven<i> fucking </i>hells! </p><p>It\u2019s worse than the Hound. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p> He once heard that wheezing,\nold grand maester refer to a condition where something bursts in a man\u2019s brain\nand blood leaks inside his skull. Sandor wonders if that\u2019s happening to him\nnow. His eyes dart over to the lad, incredulous and silently demanding an\nexplanation. </p><p>Gendry smiles ruefully and opens his mouth, but before he can\nspeak, a loud, almost manic giggle cuts through the air. </p><p>Sandor whips his head around to find the Girl standing at\nhis other side, an infant in her arms. It\u2019s a boy, he thinks, but he can\u2019t be\nsure. He hadn\u2019t heard that she\u2019d had another child. She makes no move to\nfurther greet him, even as her laughter dies down into quiet chuckling.</p><p>\u201cEr, Nell likes to tell the other children stories about\nyour adventures with Arya and me,\u201d Gendry says when he can finally make his\nvoice heard. \u201cA few of them said that Sandor Clegane sounded like\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014A villain,\u201d the Girl offers, her laughter flaring up\nagain. </p><p>\u201cRight, so\u2026 Er, you became\u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2014Ser Sandy!\u201d the Girl manages to gasp between fits of snickering.</p><p>\u201cAnd whose idea was that, I wonder?\u201d Sandor grumbles, eyes\nnarrowed. \u00a0</p><p>The Girl raises and lowers one shoulder, still smirking. \u00a0</p><p>Looking at her shit eating grin, Sandor realizes that he got\noff easy. Knowing the Girl, she probably entertained the idea of telling her\nchildren to call him Ser-Shit-for-Brains or Grand Maester Piss Crumpet. \u00a0\u201cFuck\u2019s sake.\u201d <br/></p><!-- more --><p>When the Girl speaks again, her voice is warm and her face\nhas softened into a more welcoming expression. \u201cThis is Daren,\u201d she says,\nadjusting the boy so that Sandor can get a look at his face. Anyone else would\nnow crow about how beautiful he is or ramble on about which parent he looks\nlike more. But aside from his black hair and blue eyes, he is as nondescript as\na peeled potato as far as Sandor is concerned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014 looks like a hearty little fellow.\u201d</p><p>Sandor is spared from saying anything else as something\nsmall and fast collides with his middle. He looks down to see that the older\ndaughter has thrown her arms around him. He stares down at Nell in helpless confusion\nfor a moment before awkwardly patting the top of her head. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have!\u201d Nell says proudly. She releases him and peers over\nher shoulder, realizing that Brenna has kept her distance, awkwardly twisting\nthe sleeves of her dress. Nell turns and takes her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be\nshy! You remember Uncle Sandy, don\u2019t you? He saved you, remember?\u201d</p><p>A smile slowly forms on Brenna\u2019s face. \u201cI \u2018member.\u201d She\nreleases her sister\u2019s hand and tentatively embraces Sandor as well. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it saving,\u201d Sandor says gruffly, recalling\nthe incident the children are referring to. </p><p>Though perhaps not as prissy and dainty as the average girl,\nBrenna is not nearly as rowdy or wild as her sister and mother. \u00a0She prefers to wear dresses, insects send her\ninto panic, and she utterly <i>loathes </i>filth.\n</p><p>The last time Sandor visited, Nell and Brenna raced around in\nthe early spring with other youngsters. The melting snow and ice turned much of\nthe grass into a damp, muddy quagmire. \u00a0Brenna\nwith her shorter legs was already lagging behind the other children when she\nslipped down one of the hills and tumbled into a pile of muck. She lay there rigid,\nher face frozen in a blank sort of horror Sandor associated with men who were slowly\nbleeding to death. </p><p>Sandor reached her first. He perfunctorily scooped her up\nand carried her away, back to solid ground and into her father\u2019s arms. </p><p>Gendry peered into Brenna\u2019s face anxiously while the Girl tentatively\nprobed her, looking for any serious injury. Sandor felt certain that the Girl\nmust have been thinking about her brother who had been thrown from a tower, his\nbody left shattered when he wasn\u2019t much older than Brenna. </p><p>After a long, terrifying moment, Brenna blinked\nand let out a pitiful, \u201cBlech!\u201d</p><p>Her parents half laughed, half sobbed in relief and brought\nher home to get cleaned up. \u00a0</p><p>Sandor looks down at Brenna now, noticing that her dress has\nbeen tied into knots around her calves, presumably to spare it from dragging in\nthe dirt. Her alterations reveal that she\u2019s also wearing tall, sturdy boots. Sandor\nalmost smiles. Any other mother would be horrified by her attire. </p><p>\u201cDid you bring us presents?\u201d asks Nell hopefully.</p><p>\u201c<i>Elyn</i>!\u201d the Girl\nsays at the same time Gendry says, \u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d</p><p>Nell grins sheepishly. \u201cWell, he always brings us presents\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sandor rolls his eyes and reaches into his pocket and hands\nNell a roughly made ring. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to wear this for a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty!\u201d she says, taking it from him and examining it. </p><p>\u201cSee the hinge under the stone? There\u2019s a compartment and you\ncan put poison in there.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d she says with much more enthusiasm and slips the ring\nonto her thumb but it\u2019s still quite loose.</p><p>The Girl chuckles and tells Nell that she can wear it on a\nchain until she grows more. Nell looks disappointed by that.</p><p> Less sure of Brenna\u2019s\ntastes, Sandor hesitantly hands her a wooden knight but her eyes light up as her\nsmall hand closes over it.</p><p>\u201cHe can look after my dolls,\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cLike you\ndid for Mummy and Auntie Sansa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, little one,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019ll take good care\nof them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d the Girl prompts. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Uncle Sandy!\u201d Nell and Brenna say in unison. </p><p>Sandor doesn\u2019t answer them, simply scowls at the Girl, who muffles her laughter into her husband\u2019s shoulder.</p><hr><p>Something dull digs into Sandor\u2019s side and he opens one of\nhis eyes the smallest of fractions. He didn\u2019t realize that he fell asleep. \u00a0He sat on one of the low wooden tables to\nwatch the sunrise before breakfast. It was the first morning that felt like\nsummer in over a decade and he closed his eyes instinctively as he felt the\nsunlight touch his face. He turns his head this way and that, feeling stiff and\nsore. He can\u2019t remember the last time he slept outside. </p><p>Nell grins at him, a wooden sword clutched in her hands. That\nmust have been what she prodded him with. \u201cSorry but you missed breakfast and Mum\nsays that you\u2019re so old now that we should make sure you\u2019re not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot dead,\u201d he confirms, even though he feels like he might\nnot be far off. </p><p> \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been\nwondering. What was your horse\u2019s name? The one you had when you and Mum tried\nto get to the Vale?\u201d Nell asks suddenly. \u201cBecause when I tell the stories, I\u2019ve\nbeen calling him Grey Wind, like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStranger,\u201d he says slowly. A name he\u2019d partially chosen to\nirritate his father and also partially meant to sound unfriendly, to inspire\ndistance. \u00a0The plan was both success and\nfailure; Sandor <i>loved</i> that horse and yet by some glorious miracle, managed to keep\nhim for more than twenty years, until he mercifully, peacefully succumbed to\nold age. The one constant in Sandor\u2019s life besides misery. Sandor buried Stranger himself, refusing all\noffers of help, even Ray\u2019s. The only living creature he\u2019d ever properly named.\nWith one exception. </p><p>Before he can stop it, he sees a flash of that fat barn cat\nwith its litter of kittens and he can almost feel <i>her</i> hand in his.</p><p><i>\u201cWe should call that\none Shadow!\u201d he exclaimed, his free hand pointing to the kitten with all black\nfur.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo! You mustn\u2019t name\nthem, Sandor,\u201d she said despairingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll get too attached to them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He looked up at her,\nconfused.</i></p><p><i> \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 they are very small and fragile.\nSomething might hurt them. If you name them, it will make you sadder to lose\nthem.\u201d</i></p><p>On some level, she must have suspected their fate all along\nbecause something\u2014 or more accurately, some<i>one\u2014\ndid </i>come to hurt them a few days later. \u00a0He clenches his fist and forces away the\nmemory of those dead kittens, their little bodies lying broken while their\nmother yowled. </p><p>Why is it that he remembers <i>that </i>so clearly and almost nothing about his sister? (Because<i> yes</i>, she <i>was </i>his sister and fuck his father for trying to tell him she was\njust some childhood playmate.) \u00a0The only\nthings he can remember about her is how her hand felt in his, that she was the\nmiddle child, and how she begged him not to name those damn cats. But nothing\nelse. Not her face, not her age, or the things she liked to do. Not even her\nname. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Stranger\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound very nice,\u201d Nell says, her voice\nbringing Sandor back to the present. She wrinkles her nose. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep\ncalling him Grey Wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that, child,\u201d he says, absently. \u201cThe horse doesn\u2019t\ngive two shits what you call him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said <i>shit</i>!\u201d\nShe giggles and she sounds so much like her mother that a shiver claws its way\nup Sandor\u2019s spine. It\u2019s surprisingly eerie to hear the Girl\u2019s voice come from\nthis younger, slightly discolored version of her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard worse\u2014 from your parents.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cBut not from other adults.\n My friend Maris asked me if it was true\nthat Auntie Sansa killed Mad King Joffrey. I told her I didn\u2019t know but if she\ndid, he deserved it because Mum said he was a rat-faced cunt!\u201d </p><p>Sandor nearly chokes on a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHer mum got<i> really</i>\nangry! And looked at me like I just kicked a baby! But Jon Tarly\u2019s mother said\nthat if the worst thing that ever happens to your child is that she hears some\ncurse words, you should stop complaining and be grateful.\u201d</p><p> \u201cFair point,\u201d says\nSandor.</p><p>\u201cThe complaining part or the rat-faced cunt part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Nell giggles again. This time, the laugh is her own. \u201cI\u2019m going to practice now.\u201d She gestures\nwith her wooden sword, further down towards the trees where Brenna is gathering\nup blossoms into a long chain. \u201cI\u2019m getting good,\u201d Nell says and turns on her\nheel and flounces away. </p><p>Hearing her sister\u2019s approach, Brenna looks up then sees\nSandor in the distance. \u201cHullo, Uncle Sandy!\u201d Brenna chirps. </p><p>He raises his hand in greeting. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have knocked me on my back if I called you Sandy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Sandor says, not bothering to look around, no longer\ntaken aback by the Girl\u2019s stealth. \u201cBut you were never half as a sweet as those\ntwo.\u201d He tries to make his voice sound as offhand as possible and looks away. </p><p>\u201cTrue!\u201d the Girl agrees as she settles down next to him,\ncradling her son close to her. \u201cThey get that from their father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom <i>him</i>? He\u2019s\nthe only one I\u2019ve ever met more sullen than you. Quieter, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you don\u2019t bring out that side of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fuck for that.\u201d</p><p>She snickers. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them to call you Sandy,\u201d she\nsays, suddenly serious. \u201cWell, not exactly. \u00a0When Brenna was learning to talk, Nell wanted\nto know why we all suddenly had that \u2018eee\u2019 sound at the end of our names\u2014\nMummy, Daddy, Nellie, Auntie Sansa, Uncle Jonny. I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just how\nyou talk to small children. \u00a0But I said\nit was to help babies learn who their family members are. Who is part of the\npack and who isn\u2019t. \u00a0So when their\nfriends said \u2018Sandor Clegane\u2019 sounded scary, I think Nell wanted to make sure\neveryone knew that\u2014\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a screech and Brenna screams, \u201cNell! NELL!\u201d<br/></p><p>Sandor and the Girl both tense, ready to spring to their\nfeet until their eyes fall on Brenna and see that there is no real danger. While\nwinding her way in between the branches of trees, Brenna somehow managed to walk\nface first into a mass of cobwebs. </p><p>\u201cNell!\u201d Brenna cries again, tearing at the webs. \u201cAre they\nin my hair? I think they\u2019re in my hair!\u201d</p><p>Nell, who seems to have dropped her sword, reaches Brenna\u2019s\nside. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Stay still.\u201d </p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s astounding that\nyou managed to produce someone so\u201d\u2014 the word \u201cfussy\u201d is at the tip of Sandor\u2019s\ntongue, closely followed by \u201cgirlish\u201d but those seem too harsh so he changes\ndirection \u2014\u201cgentle.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI<i> know</i>,\u201d says the Girl, her voice full of affection as Nell combs\nher fingers through Brenna\u2019s hair and plucks out a live spider. \u201cI\u2019m glad Nell\ndotes on Brenna. But I always worry that it won\u2019t last. They\u2019re so different.\nEvery day, I wake up and wonder if today\u2019s the day: that from now on they\u2019ll be\nlike Sansa and me when we were younger. We were so awful to each other\u2026 I don\u2019t\nknow how our mother stood it. I don\u2019t think I could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different. There were six of you, and then the Greyjoy\nboy. It was only the two of <i>them</i> for\na long time&hellip; I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be days when they\u2019ll want to tear\neach other\u2019s hair out but\u2026\u201d </p><p>He waits for her to laugh at him, to make a comment about\nhim getting soft in his old age but she takes him by surprise. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says, actually heartfelt and he finally meets\nher eye. They hold each other\u2019s gaze for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cHold out your hands,\u201d the Girl says suddenly.</p><p>Sandor looks at her blankly then realizes that she wants him\nto take the baby. She can\u2019t be serious. \u201cOh, fuck off.\u201d</p><p>She raises an eyebrow and glares at him but doesn\u2019t say\nanything. </p><p>Sandor eyes her, surprised to see that his refusal hurt her.\nBut then he thinks about the butcher\u2019s boy, the oldest and deepest wound\nbetween them, and what it means that she was willing to let him hold her son. \u00a0A lump starts to form in Sandor\u2019s throat. \u201cGo\non then,\u201d he mutters, extending his arms. He can\u2019t help but add, \u201cEven though\nyou\u2019re only doing it so you can take the piss out of me.\u201d</p><p> \u201cHe\u2019s not a loaf of\nbread! There, that\u2019s it. See? \u00a0Not so bad\nis it, you miserable old shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better company than his mother,\u201d Sandor retorts. \u00a0</p><p>Even though he feels utterly ridiculous, he has to admit\nthat there is something miraculous about holding this tiny, delicate human\nbeing in his hands. After a moment, Sandor\u2019s novelty has worn off for the baby\nand he starts to fuss. \u00a0</p><p>Sandor grimaces and holds the boy out to the Girl. </p><p>\u201cYou could try rocking him.\u201d</p><p>Sandor grunts and the Girl smiles as she takes her child\nback, expertly soothing him. </p><p>\u201cOooh, Nell! Nell, I can feel one near my ear! Get it!\u201d\nBrenna wails. Then adds quickly, \u201cBut don\u2019t hurt it!\u201d</p><p>Little Brenna\u2019s screams for Nell echo in Sandor\u2019s ears,\ndistorting into a slightly deeper, more panicked, more desperate voice. His\nown.</p><p><i>As the fire drew\ncloser and closer to his face, he started to yell for her, his sister. Even\nthough she\u2019d been gone for ages, ever since their father told her to go find their\nbrother and make him come inside for dinner. Sandor couldn\u2019t help but call for her.\nBecause </i>she <i>was always the one who\nsaved him. </i>She<i> was the one who\npunched their brother\u2019s shoulder when he held Sandor in a headlock for too\nlong, when he knocked Sandor over and wouldn\u2019t let him back up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNell! </i>Nell<i>!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Even when he could no\nlonger do anything but scream incoherently, her name continued to ring through\nhis head: Nell, Nell, Nell. \u00a0</i></p><p>Eleanor. <i>Eleanor!</i>\nHis sister\u2019s name was Eleanor. She didn\u2019t like Nell after Gregor started\ncalling her \u201cSmelly Nellie\u201d but Sandor slipped when he was frightened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Sandor says abruptly, watching Nell continue\nto carefully and patiently peel off strands of spider web from her younger\nsister. \u201cAnd a good big sister.\u201d He swallows. \u201cLike my sister was.\u201d His voice\nis steadier than he expected but also much quieter. \u00a0He\u2019s not even sure if the Girl heard him. \u201cNell,\u201d\nhe murmurs. \u00a0But whether he meant Nell\nClegane or Nell Baratheon, he isn\u2019t sure. </p><p>\u201cYour sister was\u2014 real?\u201d the Girl asks.</p><p>He swallows and nods. \u201cEleanor Clegane.\u201d A pause. \u201cFirst\nname on my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour \u2018list\u2019? Is it like <i>my</i>\nlist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe opposite of yours,\u201d Sandor says. \u201cIt\u2019s the list of\npeople\u2026\u201d <i>I\u2019d die for</i>. \u201cThe list of\npeople I\u2019d kill <i>for</i>.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth turns up. \u201cWithout having to pay\nyou, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he says. \u201cNo payment required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. How many people are on that list of yours?\u201d\nshe asks.</p><p>He looks away from her. \u201cAbout ten, still living.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear who\u2019s on it. Do I know any of them? \u201d </p><p>Sandor turns his head and sees something truly astonishing: Arya\nStark smiling at him. \u00a0\u201cAll right,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cIf it will shut you up, I\u2019ll name them.\u201d</p><hr><p><b>A/N ii:</b> In the books, I feel like Sandor does have some\nattachment/detachment issues with names (threatening to beat Arya if she said\nMycah\u2019s name again has stayed with me) but in the show, it\u2019s dialed up to\neleven. He almost never uses people\u2019s names, and when he does it\u2019s almost\nalways mockingly. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if it was\nintentional or not, but I always liked the contrast between Arya\u2019s obsession\nwith saying names and the way Sandor avoided them. I also thought it would be\ncool if he made a list that was the opposite of Arya\u2019s; the names of people he\nwants to protect. \u00a0</p><p>I had the majority of this written in like, 2017 but I\nwasn\u2019t sure what to call the Clegane sister. And then Eleanor hit me with it\u2019s\nnice \u201c-or\u201d ending. Of course, like 2 days later, I discover that it\u2019s a pretty\npopular fanon name for her. Also Nell is an old nickname for Eleanor and the\ncoincidence gave me chills and a better reason for Sandor to remember her name.</p><p>As for the kids names\u2014 Elyn/Nell for Catelyn and Ned, Brenna\nfor Bran, Brienne, and Sansa, and Daren for Davos and Yoren. I wanted them to\nhave names that honored people important to Gendry and Arya without going full\nAlbus Severus Potter. \u00a0:P</p>",

Anyone else would\nnow crow about how beautiful he is or ramble on about which parent he looks\nlike more. But aside from his black hair and blue eyes, he is as nondescript as\na peeled potato as far as Sandor is concerned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014 looks like a hearty little fellow.\u201d</p><p>Sandor is spared from saying anything else as something\nsmall and fast collides with his middle. He looks down to see that the older\ndaughter has thrown her arms around him. He stares down at Nell in helpless confusion\nfor a moment before awkwardly patting the top of her head. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have!\u201d Nell says proudly. She releases him and peers over\nher shoulder, realizing that Brenna has kept her distance, awkwardly twisting\nthe sleeves of her dress. Nell turns and takes her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be\nshy! You remember Uncle Sandy, don\u2019t you? He saved you, remember?\u201d</p><p>A smile slowly forms on Brenna\u2019s face. \u201cI \u2018member.\u201d She\nreleases her sister\u2019s hand and tentatively embraces Sandor as well. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it saving,\u201d Sandor says gruffly, recalling\nthe incident the children are referring to. </p><p>Though perhaps not as prissy and dainty as the average girl,\nBrenna is not nearly as rowdy or wild as her sister and mother. \u00a0She prefers to wear dresses, insects send her\ninto panic, and she utterly <i>loathes </i>filth.\n</p><p>The last time Sandor visited, Nell and Brenna raced around in\nthe early spring with other youngsters. The melting snow and ice turned much of\nthe grass into a damp, muddy quagmire. \u00a0Brenna\nwith her shorter legs was already lagging behind the other children when she\nslipped down one of the hills and tumbled into a pile of muck. She lay there rigid,\nher face frozen in a blank sort of horror Sandor associated with men who were slowly\nbleeding to death. </p><p>Sandor reached her first. He perfunctorily scooped her up\nand carried her away, back to solid ground and into her father\u2019s arms. </p><p>Gendry peered into Brenna\u2019s face anxiously while the Girl tentatively\nprobed her, looking for any serious injury. Sandor felt certain that the Girl\nmust have been thinking about her brother who had been thrown from a tower, his\nbody left shattered when he wasn\u2019t much older than Brenna. </p><p>After a long, terrifying moment, Brenna blinked\nand let out a pitiful, \u201cBlech!\u201d</p><p>Her parents half laughed, half sobbed in relief and brought\nher home to get cleaned up. \u00a0</p><p>Sandor looks down at Brenna now, noticing that her dress has\nbeen tied into knots around her calves, presumably to spare it from dragging in\nthe dirt. Her alterations reveal that she\u2019s also wearing tall, sturdy boots. Sandor\nalmost smiles. Any other mother would be horrified by her attire. </p><p>\u201cDid you bring us presents?\u201d asks Nell hopefully.</p><p>\u201c<i>Elyn</i>!\u201d the Girl\nsays at the same time Gendry says, \u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d</p><p>Nell grins sheepishly. \u201cWell, he always brings us presents\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sandor rolls his eyes and reaches into his pocket and hands\nNell a roughly made ring. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to wear this for a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty!\u201d she says, taking it from him and examining it. </p><p>\u201cSee the hinge under the stone? There\u2019s a compartment and you\ncan put poison in there.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d she says with much more enthusiasm and slips the ring\nonto her thumb but it\u2019s still quite loose.</p><p>The Girl chuckles and tells Nell that she can wear it on a\nchain until she grows more. Nell looks disappointed by that.</p><p> Less sure of Brenna\u2019s\ntastes, Sandor hesitantly hands her a wooden knight but her eyes light up as her\nsmall hand closes over it.</p><p>\u201cHe can look after my dolls,\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cLike you\ndid for Mummy and Auntie Sansa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, little one,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019ll take good care\nof them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d the Girl prompts. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Uncle Sandy!\u201d Nell and Brenna say in unison. </p><p>Sandor doesn\u2019t answer them, simply scowls at the Girl, who muffles her laughter into her husband\u2019s shoulder.</p><hr><p>Something dull digs into Sandor\u2019s side and he opens one of\nhis eyes the smallest of fractions. He didn\u2019t realize that he fell asleep. \u00a0He sat on one of the low wooden tables to\nwatch the sunrise before breakfast. It was the first morning that felt like\nsummer in over a decade and he closed his eyes instinctively as he felt the\nsunlight touch his face. He turns his head this way and that, feeling stiff and\nsore. He can\u2019t remember the last time he slept outside. </p><p>Nell grins at him, a wooden sword clutched in her hands. That\nmust have been what she prodded him with. \u201cSorry but you missed breakfast and Mum\nsays that you\u2019re so old now that we should make sure you\u2019re not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot dead,\u201d he confirms, even though he feels like he might\nnot be far off. </p><p> \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been\nwondering. What was your horse\u2019s name? The one you had when you and Mum tried\nto get to the Vale?\u201d Nell asks suddenly. \u201cBecause when I tell the stories, I\u2019ve\nbeen calling him Grey Wind, like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStranger,\u201d he says slowly. A name he\u2019d partially chosen to\nirritate his father and also partially meant to sound unfriendly, to inspire\ndistance. \u00a0The plan was both success and\nfailure; Sandor <i>loved</i> that horse and yet by some glorious miracle, managed to keep\nhim for more than twenty years, until he mercifully, peacefully succumbed to\nold age. The one constant in Sandor\u2019s life besides misery. Sandor buried Stranger himself, refusing all\noffers of help, even Ray\u2019s. The only living creature he\u2019d ever properly named.\nWith one exception. </p><p>Before he can stop it, he sees a flash of that fat barn cat\nwith its litter of kittens and he can almost feel <i>her</i> hand in his.</p><p><i>\u201cWe should call that\none Shadow!\u201d he exclaimed, his free hand pointing to the kitten with all black\nfur.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo! You mustn\u2019t name\nthem, Sandor,\u201d she said despairingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll get too attached to them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He looked up at her,\nconfused.</i></p><p><i> \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 they are very small and fragile.\nSomething might hurt them. If you name them, it will make you sadder to lose\nthem.\u201d</i></p><p>On some level, she must have suspected their fate all along\nbecause something\u2014 or more accurately, some<i>one\u2014\ndid </i>come to hurt them a few days later. \u00a0He clenches his fist and forces away the\nmemory of those dead kittens, their little bodies lying broken while their\nmother yowled. </p><p>Why is it that he remembers <i>that </i>so clearly and almost nothing about his sister? (Because<i> yes</i>, she <i>was </i>his sister and fuck his father for trying to tell him she was\njust some childhood playmate.) \u00a0The only\nthings he can remember about her is how her hand felt in his, that she was the\nmiddle child, and how she begged him not to name those damn cats. But nothing\nelse. Not her face, not her age, or the things she liked to do. Not even her\nname. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Stranger\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound very nice,\u201d Nell says, her voice\nbringing Sandor back to the present. She wrinkles her nose. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep\ncalling him Grey Wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that, child,\u201d he says, absently. \u201cThe horse doesn\u2019t\ngive two shits what you call him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said <i>shit</i>!\u201d\nShe giggles and she sounds so much like her mother that a shiver claws its way\nup Sandor\u2019s spine. It\u2019s surprisingly eerie to hear the Girl\u2019s voice come from\nthis younger, slightly discolored version of her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard worse\u2014 from your parents.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cBut not from other adults.\n My friend Maris asked me if it was true\nthat Auntie Sansa killed Mad King Joffrey. I told her I didn\u2019t know but if she\ndid, he deserved it because Mum said he was a rat-faced cunt!\u201d </p><p>Sandor nearly chokes on a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHer mum got<i> really</i>\nangry! And looked at me like I just kicked a baby! But Jon Tarly\u2019s mother said\nthat if the worst thing that ever happens to your child is that she hears some\ncurse words, you should stop complaining and be grateful.\u201d</p><p> \u201cFair point,\u201d says\nSandor.</p><p>\u201cThe complaining part or the rat-faced cunt part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Nell giggles again. This time, the laugh is her own. \u201cI\u2019m going to practice now.\u201d She gestures\nwith her wooden sword, further down towards the trees where Brenna is gathering\nup blossoms into a long chain. \u201cI\u2019m getting good,\u201d Nell says and turns on her\nheel and flounces away. </p><p>Hearing her sister\u2019s approach, Brenna looks up then sees\nSandor in the distance. \u201cHullo, Uncle Sandy!\u201d Brenna chirps. </p><p>He raises his hand in greeting. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have knocked me on my back if I called you Sandy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Sandor says, not bothering to look around, no longer\ntaken aback by the Girl\u2019s stealth. \u201cBut you were never half as a sweet as those\ntwo.\u201d He tries to make his voice sound as offhand as possible and looks away. </p><p>\u201cTrue!\u201d the Girl agrees as she settles down next to him,\ncradling her son close to her. \u201cThey get that from their father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom <i>him</i>? He\u2019s\nthe only one I\u2019ve ever met more sullen than you. Quieter, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you don\u2019t bring out that side of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fuck for that.\u201d</p><p>She snickers. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them to call you Sandy,\u201d she\nsays, suddenly serious. \u201cWell, not exactly. \u00a0When Brenna was learning to talk, Nell wanted\nto know why we all suddenly had that \u2018eee\u2019 sound at the end of our names\u2014\nMummy, Daddy, Nellie, Auntie Sansa, Uncle Jonny. I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just how\nyou talk to small children. \u00a0But I said\nit was to help babies learn who their family members are. Who is part of the\npack and who isn\u2019t. \u00a0So when their\nfriends said \u2018Sandor Clegane\u2019 sounded scary, I think Nell wanted to make sure\neveryone knew that\u2014\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a screech and Brenna screams, \u201cNell! NELL!\u201d<br></p><p>Sandor and the Girl both tense, ready to spring to their\nfeet until their eyes fall on Brenna and see that there is no real danger. While\nwinding her way in between the branches of trees, Brenna somehow managed to walk\nface first into a mass of cobwebs. </p><p>\u201cNell!\u201d Brenna cries again, tearing at the webs. \u201cAre they\nin my hair? I think they\u2019re in my hair!\u201d</p><p>Nell, who seems to have dropped her sword, reaches Brenna\u2019s\nside. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Stay still.\u201d </p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s astounding that\nyou managed to produce someone so\u201d\u2014 the word \u201cfussy\u201d is at the tip of Sandor\u2019s\ntongue, closely followed by \u201cgirlish\u201d but those seem too harsh so he changes\ndirection \u2014\u201cgentle.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI<i> know</i>,\u201d says the Girl, her voice full of affection as Nell combs\nher fingers through Brenna\u2019s hair and plucks out a live spider. \u201cI\u2019m glad Nell\ndotes on Brenna. But I always worry that it won\u2019t last. They\u2019re so different.\nEvery day, I wake up and wonder if today\u2019s the day: that from now on they\u2019ll be\nlike Sansa and me when we were younger. We were so awful to each other\u2026 I don\u2019t\nknow how our mother stood it. I don\u2019t think I could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different. There were six of you, and then the Greyjoy\nboy. It was only the two of <i>them</i> for\na long time\u2026 I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be days when they\u2019ll want to tear\neach other\u2019s hair out but\u2026\u201d </p><p>He waits for her to laugh at him, to make a comment about\nhim getting soft in his old age but she takes him by surprise. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says, actually heartfelt and he finally meets\nher eye. They hold each other\u2019s gaze for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cHold out your hands,\u201d the Girl says suddenly.</p><p>Sandor looks at her blankly then realizes that she wants him\nto take the baby. She can\u2019t be serious. \u201cOh, fuck off.\u201d</p><p>She raises an eyebrow and glares at him but doesn\u2019t say\nanything. </p><p>Sandor eyes her, surprised to see that his refusal hurt her.\nBut then he thinks about the butcher\u2019s boy, the oldest and deepest wound\nbetween them, and what it means that she was willing to let him hold her son. \u00a0A lump starts to form in Sandor\u2019s throat. \u201cGo\non then,\u201d he mutters, extending his arms. He can\u2019t help but add, \u201cEven though\nyou\u2019re only doing it so you can take the piss out of me.\u201d</p><p> \u201cHe\u2019s not a loaf of\nbread! There, that\u2019s it. See? \u00a0Not so bad\nis it, you miserable old shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better company than his mother,\u201d Sandor retorts. \u00a0</p><p>Even though he feels utterly ridiculous, he has to admit\nthat there is something miraculous about holding this tiny, delicate human\nbeing in his hands. After a moment, Sandor\u2019s novelty has worn off for the baby\nand he starts to fuss. \u00a0</p><p>Sandor grimaces and holds the boy out to the Girl. </p><p>\u201cYou could try rocking him.\u201d</p><p>Sandor grunts and the Girl smiles as she takes her child\nback, expertly soothing him. </p><p>\u201cOooh, Nell! Nell, I can feel one near my ear! Get it!\u201d\nBrenna wails. Then adds quickly, \u201cBut don\u2019t hurt it!\u201d</p><p>Little Brenna\u2019s screams for Nell echo in Sandor\u2019s ears,\ndistorting into a slightly deeper, more panicked, more desperate voice. His\nown.</p><p><i>As the fire drew\ncloser and closer to his face, he started to yell for her, his sister. Even\nthough she\u2019d been gone for ages, ever since their father told her to go find their\nbrother and make him come inside for dinner. Sandor couldn\u2019t help but call for her.\nBecause </i>she <i>was always the one who\nsaved him. </i>She<i> was the one who\npunched their brother\u2019s shoulder when he held Sandor in a headlock for too\nlong, when he knocked Sandor over and wouldn\u2019t let him back up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNell! </i>Nell<i>!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Even when he could no\nlonger do anything but scream incoherently, her name continued to ring through\nhis head: Nell, Nell, Nell. \u00a0</i></p><p>Eleanor. <i>Eleanor!</i>\nHis sister\u2019s name was Eleanor. She didn\u2019t like Nell after Gregor started\ncalling her \u201cSmelly Nellie\u201d but Sandor slipped when he was frightened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Sandor says abruptly, watching Nell continue\nto carefully and patiently peel off strands of spider web from her younger\nsister. \u201cAnd a good big sister.\u201d He swallows. \u201cLike my sister was.\u201d His voice\nis steadier than he expected but also much quieter. \u00a0He\u2019s not even sure if the Girl heard him. \u201cNell,\u201d\nhe murmurs. \u00a0But whether he meant Nell\nClegane or Nell Baratheon, he isn\u2019t sure. </p><p>\u201cYour sister was\u2014 real?\u201d the Girl asks.</p><p>He swallows and nods. \u201cEleanor Clegane.\u201d A pause. \u201cFirst\nname on my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour \u2018list\u2019? Is it like <i>my</i>\nlist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe opposite of yours,\u201d Sandor says. \u201cIt\u2019s the list of\npeople\u2026\u201d <i>I\u2019d die for</i>. \u201cThe list of\npeople I\u2019d kill <i>for</i>.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth turns up. \u201cWithout having to pay\nyou, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he says. \u201cNo payment required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. How many people are on that list of yours?\u201d\nshe asks.</p><p>He looks away from her. \u201cAbout ten, still living.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear who\u2019s on it. Do I know any of them? \u201d </p><p>Sandor turns his head and sees something truly astonishing: Arya\nStark smiling at him. \u00a0\u201cAll right,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cIf it will shut you up, I\u2019ll name them.\u201d</p><hr><p><b>A/N ii:</b> In the books, I feel like Sandor does have some\nattachment/detachment issues with names (threatening to beat Arya if she said\nMycah\u2019s name again has stayed with me) but in the show, it\u2019s dialed up to\neleven. He almost never uses people\u2019s names, and when he does it\u2019s almost\nalways mockingly. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if it was\nintentional or not, but I always liked the contrast between Arya\u2019s obsession\nwith saying names and the way Sandor avoided them. I also thought it would be\ncool if he made a list that was the opposite of Arya\u2019s; the names of people he\nwants to protect. \u00a0</p><p>I had the majority of this written in like, 2017 but I\nwasn\u2019t sure what to call the Clegane sister. And then Eleanor hit me with it\u2019s\nnice \u201c-or\u201d ending. Of course, like 2 days later, I discover that it\u2019s a pretty\npopular fanon name for her. Also Nell is an old nickname for Eleanor and the\ncoincidence gave me chills and a better reason for Sandor to remember her name.</p><p>As for the kids names\u2014 Elyn/Nell for Catelyn and Ned, Brenna\nfor Bran, Brienne, and Sansa, and Daren for Davos and Yoren. I wanted them to\nhave names that honored people important to Gendry and Arya without going full\nAlbus Severus Potter. \u00a0:P</p>",

Plus\nRory McCann would totally own being \u201cUncle Sandy.\u201d ;)\u00a0 <br></p><p>Please keep in mind that I haven\u2019t written anything in <b>forever</b> and this is way out of my comfort zone. <br></p><p>It\u2019s Sandor\u2019s POV, so there\u2019s a good bit of language.<b><br></b></p><hr><p>Sandor Clagane spots the daughters first. They\u2019re a fair\ndistance away and it\u2019s been well over a year since he\u2019s seen them, but he\u2019d\nknow them anywhere. They may have their father\u2019s hair and eyes, but otherwise,\nthey are entirely their mother. \u00a0The\nolder one must be seven or eight. \u00a0She\u2019s called Nell but that\u2019s short for\nsomething Sandor can\u2019t remember. And the younger one is\u2026 Brenna? Branna?\nBrenna. She looks about five. \u00a0</p><p>He looks around for their mother and father, the Girl and\nthe lad. It strikes him now how stupid it is that he still thinks of them that\nway. \u00a0The Girl would be about\ntwenty-eight by now and the lad is maybe thirty-three? They are long grown and\nhaven\u2019t been a girl and a lad for many years now. \u00a0</p><p>But\u2026 old habits. The Girl, the lad, Little Bird, the prince,\nthe king\u2026 the butcher\u2019s boy. \u00a0Titles,\nepithets, those are easier than names. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been for ages. Almost\nhis whole life, ever since\u2014</p><p><i>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t name\nthem, Sandor. You\u2019ll get too attached.\u201d </i></p><p>He clenches his teeth and shakes his head, needing to make\nthat sweet little voice quiet.</p><p> <i>\u201cIf you name them, it will make you sadder to lose them.\u201d</i></p><p>It\u2019s true. Death is sadder when they have names.</p><p>Having names can also make it harder to kill them. </p><p>He sees the lad first. Gendry. </p><p>The corner of Gendry\u2019s mouth turns upwards in surprise and\nhe makes his way over to Sandor. They don\u2019t speak; merely grasp each other\u2019s\nhands briefly and nod. \u00a0</p><p>Gendry turns in the direction to where his daughters are\nplaying. \u201cGirls?\u201d he calls, cupping his hands around his mouth to make himself\nlouder. \u201cCome see who\u2019s here!\u201d </p><p>The children\u2019s heads snap up in unison at the sound of their\nfather\u2019s voice. \u00a0\u201cOh, look!\u201d the older\none cries. Her voice echoes incredibly loud and shrill in the way only children\ncan manage. \u201cDo you know who that is? It\u2019s Uncle Sandy!\u201d</p><p>Sandor\u2019s mind goes blank for a moment, unable to comprehend\nwhat he just heard. \u00a0He feels an eye\ntwitch and his upper lip curl. He\u2019s not surprised they called him \u201cUncle.\u201d The\nlast time he was here, the Girl\u2014 either unwilling or unable to explain their affiliation\nto her daughters\u2014had referred to Sandor as her uncle. \u00a0But <i>Sandy</i>?\nUncle <i>Sandy</i>? Seven<i> fucking </i>hells! </p><p>It\u2019s worse than the Hound. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p> He once heard that wheezing,\nold grand maester refer to a condition where something bursts in a man\u2019s brain\nand blood leaks inside his skull. Sandor wonders if that\u2019s happening to him\nnow. His eyes dart over to the lad, incredulous and silently demanding an\nexplanation. </p><p>Gendry smiles ruefully and opens his mouth, but before he can\nspeak, a loud, almost manic giggle cuts through the air. </p><p>Sandor whips his head around to find the Girl standing at\nhis other side, an infant in her arms. It\u2019s a boy, he thinks, but he can\u2019t be\nsure. He hadn\u2019t heard that she\u2019d had another child. She makes no move to\nfurther greet him, even as her laughter dies down into quiet chuckling.</p><p>\u201cEr, Nell likes to tell the other children stories about\nyour adventures with Arya and me,\u201d Gendry says when he can finally make his\nvoice heard. \u201cA few of them said that Sandor Clegane sounded like\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014A villain,\u201d the Girl offers, her laughter flaring up\nagain. </p><p>\u201cRight, so\u2026 Er, you became\u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2014Ser Sandy!\u201d the Girl manages to gasp between fits of snickering.</p><p>\u201cAnd whose idea was that, I wonder?\u201d Sandor grumbles, eyes\nnarrowed. \u00a0</p><p>The Girl raises and lowers one shoulder, still smirking. \u00a0</p><p>Looking at her shit eating grin, Sandor realizes that he got\noff easy. Knowing the Girl, she probably entertained the idea of telling her\nchildren to call him Ser-Shit-for-Brains or Grand Maester Piss Crumpet. \u00a0\u201cFuck\u2019s sake.\u201d <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>When the Girl speaks again, her voice is warm and her face\nhas softened into a more welcoming expression. \u201cThis is Daren,\u201d she says,\nadjusting the boy so that Sandor can get a look at his face. Anyone else would\nnow crow about how beautiful he is or ramble on about which parent he looks\nlike more. But aside from his black hair and blue eyes, he is as nondescript as\na peeled potato as far as Sandor is concerned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014 looks like a hearty little fellow.\u201d</p><p>Sandor is spared from saying anything else as something\nsmall and fast collides with his middle. He looks down to see that the older\ndaughter has thrown her arms around him. He stares down at Nell in helpless confusion\nfor a moment before awkwardly patting the top of her head. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have!\u201d Nell says proudly. She releases him and peers over\nher shoulder, realizing that Brenna has kept her distance, awkwardly twisting\nthe sleeves of her dress. Nell turns and takes her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be\nshy! You remember Uncle Sandy, don\u2019t you? He saved you, remember?\u201d</p><p>A smile slowly forms on Brenna\u2019s face. \u201cI \u2018member.\u201d She\nreleases her sister\u2019s hand and tentatively embraces Sandor as well. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it saving,\u201d Sandor says gruffly, recalling\nthe incident the children are referring to. </p><p>Though perhaps not as prissy and dainty as the average girl,\nBrenna is not nearly as rowdy or wild as her sister and mother. \u00a0She prefers to wear dresses, insects send her\ninto panic, and she utterly <i>loathes </i>filth.\n</p><p>The last time Sandor visited, Nell and Brenna raced around in\nthe early spring with other youngsters. The melting snow and ice turned much of\nthe grass into a damp, muddy quagmire. \u00a0Brenna\nwith her shorter legs was already lagging behind the other children when she\nslipped down one of the hills and tumbled into a pile of muck. She lay there rigid,\nher face frozen in a blank sort of horror Sandor associated with men who were slowly\nbleeding to death. </p><p>Sandor reached her first. He perfunctorily scooped her up\nand carried her away, back to solid ground and into her father\u2019s arms. </p><p>Gendry peered into Brenna\u2019s face anxiously while the Girl tentatively\nprobed her, looking for any serious injury. Sandor felt certain that the Girl\nmust have been thinking about her brother who had been thrown from a tower, his\nbody left shattered when he wasn\u2019t much older than Brenna. </p><p>After a long, terrifying moment, Brenna blinked\nand let out a pitiful, \u201cBlech!\u201d</p><p>Her parents half laughed, half sobbed in relief and brought\nher home to get cleaned up. \u00a0</p><p>Sandor looks down at Brenna now, noticing that her dress has\nbeen tied into knots around her calves, presumably to spare it from dragging in\nthe dirt. Her alterations reveal that she\u2019s also wearing tall, sturdy boots. Sandor\nalmost smiles. Any other mother would be horrified by her attire. </p><p>\u201cDid you bring us presents?\u201d asks Nell hopefully.</p><p>\u201c<i>Elyn</i>!\u201d the Girl\nsays at the same time Gendry says, \u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d</p><p>Nell grins sheepishly. \u201cWell, he always brings us presents\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sandor rolls his eyes and reaches into his pocket and hands\nNell a roughly made ring. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to wear this for a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty!\u201d she says, taking it from him and examining it. </p><p>\u201cSee the hinge under the stone? There\u2019s a compartment and you\ncan put poison in there.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d she says with much more enthusiasm and slips the ring\nonto her thumb but it\u2019s still quite loose.</p><p>The Girl chuckles and tells Nell that she can wear it on a\nchain until she grows more. Nell looks disappointed by that.</p><p> Less sure of Brenna\u2019s\ntastes, Sandor hesitantly hands her a wooden knight but her eyes light up as her\nsmall hand closes over it.</p><p>\u201cHe can look after my dolls,\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cLike you\ndid for Mummy and Auntie Sansa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, little one,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019ll take good care\nof them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d the Girl prompts. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Uncle Sandy!\u201d Nell and Brenna say in unison. </p><p>Sandor doesn\u2019t answer them, simply scowls at the Girl, who muffles her laughter into her husband\u2019s shoulder.</p><hr><p>Something dull digs into Sandor\u2019s side and he opens one of\nhis eyes the smallest of fractions. He didn\u2019t realize that he fell asleep. \u00a0He sat on one of the low wooden tables to\nwatch the sunrise before breakfast. It was the first morning that felt like\nsummer in over a decade and he closed his eyes instinctively as he felt the\nsunlight touch his face. He turns his head this way and that, feeling stiff and\nsore. He can\u2019t remember the last time he slept outside. </p><p>Nell grins at him, a wooden sword clutched in her hands. That\nmust have been what she prodded him with. \u201cSorry but you missed breakfast and Mum\nsays that you\u2019re so old now that we should make sure you\u2019re not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot dead,\u201d he confirms, even though he feels like he might\nnot be far off. </p><p> \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been\nwondering. What was your horse\u2019s name? The one you had when you and Mum tried\nto get to the Vale?\u201d Nell asks suddenly. \u201cBecause when I tell the stories, I\u2019ve\nbeen calling him Grey Wind, like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStranger,\u201d he says slowly. A name he\u2019d partially chosen to\nirritate his father and also partially meant to sound unfriendly, to inspire\ndistance. \u00a0The plan was both success and\nfailure; Sandor <i>loved</i> that horse and yet by some glorious miracle, managed to keep\nhim for more than twenty years, until he mercifully, peacefully succumbed to\nold age. The one constant in Sandor\u2019s life besides misery. Sandor buried Stranger himself, refusing all\noffers of help, even Ray\u2019s. The only living creature he\u2019d ever properly named.\nWith one exception. </p><p>Before he can stop it, he sees a flash of that fat barn cat\nwith its litter of kittens and he can almost feel <i>her</i> hand in his.</p><p><i>\u201cWe should call that\none Shadow!\u201d he exclaimed, his free hand pointing to the kitten with all black\nfur.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo! You mustn\u2019t name\nthem, Sandor,\u201d she said despairingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll get too attached to them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He looked up at her,\nconfused.</i></p><p><i> \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 they are very small and fragile.\nSomething might hurt them. If you name them, it will make you sadder to lose\nthem.\u201d</i></p><p>On some level, she must have suspected their fate all along\nbecause something\u2014 or more accurately, some<i>one\u2014\ndid </i>come to hurt them a few days later. \u00a0He clenches his fist and forces away the\nmemory of those dead kittens, their little bodies lying broken while their\nmother yowled. </p><p>Why is it that he remembers <i>that </i>so clearly and almost nothing about his sister? (Because<i> yes</i>, she <i>was </i>his sister and fuck his father for trying to tell him she was\njust some childhood playmate.) \u00a0The only\nthings he can remember about her is how her hand felt in his, that she was the\nmiddle child, and how she begged him not to name those damn cats. But nothing\nelse. Not her face, not her age, or the things she liked to do. Not even her\nname. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Stranger\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound very nice,\u201d Nell says, her voice\nbringing Sandor back to the present. She wrinkles her nose. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep\ncalling him Grey Wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that, child,\u201d he says, absently. \u201cThe horse doesn\u2019t\ngive two shits what you call him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said <i>shit</i>!\u201d\nShe giggles and she sounds so much like her mother that a shiver claws its way\nup Sandor\u2019s spine. It\u2019s surprisingly eerie to hear the Girl\u2019s voice come from\nthis younger, slightly discolored version of her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard worse\u2014 from your parents.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cBut not from other adults.\n My friend Maris asked me if it was true\nthat Auntie Sansa killed Mad King Joffrey. I told her I didn\u2019t know but if she\ndid, he deserved it because Mum said he was a rat-faced cunt!\u201d </p><p>Sandor nearly chokes on a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHer mum got<i> really</i>\nangry! And looked at me like I just kicked a baby! But Jon Tarly\u2019s mother said\nthat if the worst thing that ever happens to your child is that she hears some\ncurse words, you should stop complaining and be grateful.\u201d</p><p> \u201cFair point,\u201d says\nSandor.</p><p>\u201cThe complaining part or the rat-faced cunt part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Nell giggles again. This time, the laugh is her own. \u201cI\u2019m going to practice now.\u201d She gestures\nwith her wooden sword, further down towards the trees where Brenna is gathering\nup blossoms into a long chain. \u201cI\u2019m getting good,\u201d Nell says and turns on her\nheel and flounces away. </p><p>Hearing her sister\u2019s approach, Brenna looks up then sees\nSandor in the distance. \u201cHullo, Uncle Sandy!\u201d Brenna chirps. </p><p>He raises his hand in greeting. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have knocked me on my back if I called you Sandy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Sandor says, not bothering to look around, no longer\ntaken aback by the Girl\u2019s stealth. \u201cBut you were never half as a sweet as those\ntwo.\u201d He tries to make his voice sound as offhand as possible and looks away. </p><p>\u201cTrue!\u201d the Girl agrees as she settles down next to him,\ncradling her son close to her. \u201cThey get that from their father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom <i>him</i>? He\u2019s\nthe only one I\u2019ve ever met more sullen than you. Quieter, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you don\u2019t bring out that side of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fuck for that.\u201d</p><p>She snickers. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them to call you Sandy,\u201d she\nsays, suddenly serious. \u201cWell, not exactly. \u00a0When Brenna was learning to talk, Nell wanted\nto know why we all suddenly had that \u2018eee\u2019 sound at the end of our names\u2014\nMummy, Daddy, Nellie, Auntie Sansa, Uncle Jonny. I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just how\nyou talk to small children. \u00a0But I said\nit was to help babies learn who their family members are. Who is part of the\npack and who isn\u2019t. \u00a0So when their\nfriends said \u2018Sandor Clegane\u2019 sounded scary, I think Nell wanted to make sure\neveryone knew that\u2014\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a screech and Brenna screams, \u201cNell! NELL!\u201d<br></p><p>Sandor and the Girl both tense, ready to spring to their\nfeet until their eyes fall on Brenna and see that there is no real danger. While\nwinding her way in between the branches of trees, Brenna somehow managed to walk\nface first into a mass of cobwebs. </p><p>\u201cNell!\u201d Brenna cries again, tearing at the webs. \u201cAre they\nin my hair? I think they\u2019re in my hair!\u201d</p><p>Nell, who seems to have dropped her sword, reaches Brenna\u2019s\nside. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Stay still.\u201d </p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s astounding that\nyou managed to produce someone so\u201d\u2014 the word \u201cfussy\u201d is at the tip of Sandor\u2019s\ntongue, closely followed by \u201cgirlish\u201d but those seem too harsh so he changes\ndirection \u2014\u201cgentle.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI<i> know</i>,\u201d says the Girl, her voice full of affection as Nell combs\nher fingers through Brenna\u2019s hair and plucks out a live spider. \u201cI\u2019m glad Nell\ndotes on Brenna. But I always worry that it won\u2019t last. They\u2019re so different.\nEvery day, I wake up and wonder if today\u2019s the day: that from now on they\u2019ll be\nlike Sansa and me when we were younger. We were so awful to each other\u2026 I don\u2019t\nknow how our mother stood it. I don\u2019t think I could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different. There were six of you, and then the Greyjoy\nboy. It was only the two of <i>them</i> for\na long time\u2026 I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be days when they\u2019ll want to tear\neach other\u2019s hair out but\u2026\u201d </p><p>He waits for her to laugh at him, to make a comment about\nhim getting soft in his old age but she takes him by surprise. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says, actually heartfelt and he finally meets\nher eye. They hold each other\u2019s gaze for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cHold out your hands,\u201d the Girl says suddenly.</p><p>Sandor looks at her blankly then realizes that she wants him\nto take the baby. She can\u2019t be serious. \u201cOh, fuck off.\u201d</p><p>She raises an eyebrow and glares at him but doesn\u2019t say\nanything. </p><p>Sandor eyes her, surprised to see that his refusal hurt her.\nBut then he thinks about the butcher\u2019s boy, the oldest and deepest wound\nbetween them, and what it means that she was willing to let him hold her son. \u00a0A lump starts to form in Sandor\u2019s throat. \u201cGo\non then,\u201d he mutters, extending his arms. He can\u2019t help but add, \u201cEven though\nyou\u2019re only doing it so you can take the piss out of me.\u201d</p><p> \u201cHe\u2019s not a loaf of\nbread! There, that\u2019s it. See? \u00a0Not so bad\nis it, you miserable old shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better company than his mother,\u201d Sandor retorts. \u00a0</p><p>Even though he feels utterly ridiculous, he has to admit\nthat there is something miraculous about holding this tiny, delicate human\nbeing in his hands. After a moment, Sandor\u2019s novelty has worn off for the baby\nand he starts to fuss. \u00a0</p><p>Sandor grimaces and holds the boy out to the Girl. </p><p>\u201cYou could try rocking him.\u201d</p><p>Sandor grunts and the Girl smiles as she takes her child\nback, expertly soothing him. </p><p>\u201cOooh, Nell! Nell, I can feel one near my ear! Get it!\u201d\nBrenna wails. Then adds quickly, \u201cBut don\u2019t hurt it!\u201d</p><p>Little Brenna\u2019s screams for Nell echo in Sandor\u2019s ears,\ndistorting into a slightly deeper, more panicked, more desperate voice. His\nown.</p><p><i>As the fire drew\ncloser and closer to his face, he started to yell for her, his sister. Even\nthough she\u2019d been gone for ages, ever since their father told her to go find their\nbrother and make him come inside for dinner. Sandor couldn\u2019t help but call for her.\nBecause </i>she <i>was always the one who\nsaved him. </i>She<i> was the one who\npunched their brother\u2019s shoulder when he held Sandor in a headlock for too\nlong, when he knocked Sandor over and wouldn\u2019t let him back up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNell! </i>Nell<i>!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Even when he could no\nlonger do anything but scream incoherently, her name continued to ring through\nhis head: Nell, Nell, Nell. \u00a0</i></p><p>Eleanor. <i>Eleanor!</i>\nHis sister\u2019s name was Eleanor. She didn\u2019t like Nell after Gregor started\ncalling her \u201cSmelly Nellie\u201d but Sandor slipped when he was frightened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Sandor says abruptly, watching Nell continue\nto carefully and patiently peel off strands of spider web from her younger\nsister. \u201cAnd a good big sister.\u201d He swallows. \u201cLike my sister was.\u201d His voice\nis steadier than he expected but also much quieter. \u00a0He\u2019s not even sure if the Girl heard him. \u201cNell,\u201d\nhe murmurs. \u00a0But whether he meant Nell\nClegane or Nell Baratheon, he isn\u2019t sure. </p><p>\u201cYour sister was\u2014 real?\u201d the Girl asks.</p><p>He swallows and nods. \u201cEleanor Clegane.\u201d A pause. \u201cFirst\nname on my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour \u2018list\u2019? Is it like <i>my</i>\nlist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe opposite of yours,\u201d Sandor says. \u201cIt\u2019s the list of\npeople\u2026\u201d <i>I\u2019d die for</i>. \u201cThe list of\npeople I\u2019d kill <i>for</i>.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth turns up. \u201cWithout having to pay\nyou, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he says. \u201cNo payment required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. How many people are on that list of yours?\u201d\nshe asks.</p><p>He looks away from her. \u201cAbout ten, still living.\u201d \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear who\u2019s on it. Do I know any of them? \u201d </p><p>Sandor turns his head and sees something truly astonishing: Arya\nStark smiling at him. \u00a0\u201cAll right,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cIf it will shut you up, I\u2019ll name them.\u201d</p><hr><p><b>A/N ii:</b> In the books, I feel like Sandor does have some\nattachment/detachment issues with names (threatening to beat Arya if she said\nMycah\u2019s name again has stayed with me) but in the show, it\u2019s dialed up to\neleven. He almost never uses people\u2019s names, and when he does it\u2019s almost\nalways mockingly. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if it was\nintentional or not, but I always liked the contrast between Arya\u2019s obsession\nwith saying names and the way Sandor avoided them. I also thought it would be\ncool if he made a list that was the opposite of Arya\u2019s; the names of people he\nwants to protect. \u00a0</p><p>I had the majority of this written in like, 2017 but I\nwasn\u2019t sure what to call the Clegane sister. And then Eleanor hit me with it\u2019s\nnice \u201c-or\u201d ending. Of course, like 2 days later, I discover that it\u2019s a pretty\npopular fanon name for her. Also Nell is an old nickname for Eleanor and the\ncoincidence gave me chills and a better reason for Sandor to remember her name.</p><p>As for the kids names\u2014 Elyn/Nell for Catelyn and Ned, Brenna\nfor Bran, Brienne, and Sansa, and Daren for Davos and Yoren. I wanted them to\nhave names that honored people important to Gendry and Arya without going full\nAlbus Severus Potter. \u00a0:P</p>",

They may have their father&rsquo;s hair and eyes, but otherwise,\nthey are entirely their mother. &nbsp;The\nolder one must be seven or eight. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s called Nell but that&rsquo;s short for\nsomething Sandor can&rsquo;t remember. And the younger one is&hellip; Brenna? Branna?\nBrenna. She looks about five. &nbsp;</p><p>He looks around for their mother and father, the Girl and\nthe lad. It strikes him now how stupid it is that he still thinks of them that\nway. &nbsp;The Girl would be about\ntwenty-eight by now and the lad is maybe thirty-three? They are long grown and\nhaven&rsquo;t been a girl and a lad for many years now. &nbsp;</p><p>But&hellip; old habits. The Girl, the lad, Little Bird, the prince,\nthe king&hellip; the butcher&rsquo;s boy. &nbsp;Titles,\nepithets, those are easier than names. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s been for ages. Almost\nhis whole life, ever since&mdash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t name\nthem, Sandor. You&rsquo;ll get too attached.&rdquo; </i></p><p>He clenches his teeth and shakes his head, needing to make\nthat sweet little voice quiet.</p><p> <i>&ldquo;If you name them, it will make you sadder to lose them.&rdquo;</i></p><p>It&rsquo;s true. Death is sadder when they have names.</p><p>Having names can also make it harder to kill them. </p><p>He sees the lad first. Gendry. </p><p>The corner of Gendry&rsquo;s mouth turns upwards in surprise and\nhe makes his way over to Sandor. They don&rsquo;t speak; merely grasp each other&rsquo;s\nhands briefly and nod. &nbsp;</p><p>Gendry turns in the direction to where his daughters are\nplaying. &ldquo;Girls?&rdquo; he calls, cupping his hands around his mouth to make himself\nlouder. &ldquo;Come see who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; </p><p>The children&rsquo;s heads snap up in unison at the sound of their\nfather&rsquo;s voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, look!&rdquo; the older\none cries. Her voice echoes incredibly loud and shrill in the way only children\ncan manage. &ldquo;Do you know who that is? It&rsquo;s Uncle Sandy!&rdquo;</p><p>Sandor&rsquo;s mind goes blank for a moment, unable to comprehend\nwhat he just heard. &nbsp;He feels an eye\ntwitch and his upper lip curl. He&rsquo;s not surprised they called him &ldquo;Uncle.&rdquo; The\nlast time he was here, the Girl&mdash; either unwilling or unable to explain their affiliation\nto her daughters&mdash;had referred to Sandor as her uncle. &nbsp;But <i>Sandy</i>?\nUncle <i>Sandy</i>? Seven<i> fucking </i>hells! </p><p>It&rsquo;s worse than the Hound. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p> He once heard that wheezing,\nold grand maester refer to a condition where something bursts in a man&rsquo;s brain\nand blood leaks inside his skull. Sandor wonders if that&rsquo;s happening to him\nnow. His eyes dart over to the lad, incredulous and silently demanding an\nexplanation. </p><p>Gendry smiles ruefully and opens his mouth, but before he can\nspeak, a loud, almost manic giggle cuts through the air. </p><p>Sandor whips his head around to find the Girl standing at\nhis other side, an infant in her arms. It&rsquo;s a boy, he thinks, but he can&rsquo;t be\nsure. He hadn&rsquo;t heard that she&rsquo;d had another child. She makes no move to\nfurther greet him, even as her laughter dies down into quiet chuckling.</p><p>&ldquo;Er, Nell likes to tell the other children stories about\nyour adventures with Arya and me,&rdquo; Gendry says when he can finally make his\nvoice heard. &ldquo;A few of them said that Sandor Clegane sounded like&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;A villain,&rdquo; the Girl offers, her laughter flaring up\nagain. </p><p>&ldquo;Right, so&hellip; Er, you became&mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Ser Sandy!&rdquo; the Girl manages to gasp between fits of snickering.</p><p>&ldquo;And whose idea was that, I wonder?&rdquo; Sandor grumbles, eyes\nnarrowed. &nbsp;</p><p>The Girl raises and lowers one shoulder, still smirking. &nbsp;</p><p>Looking at her shit eating grin, Sandor realizes that he got\noff easy. Knowing the Girl, she probably entertained the idea of telling her\nchildren to call him Ser-Shit-for-Brains or Grand Maester Piss Crumpet. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>When the Girl speaks again, her voice is warm and her face\nhas softened into a more welcoming expression. &ldquo;This is Daren,&rdquo; she says,\nadjusting the boy so that Sandor can get a look at his face. Anyone else would\nnow crow about how beautiful he is or ramble on about which parent he looks\nlike more. But aside from his black hair and blue eyes, he is as nondescript as\na peeled potato as far as Sandor is concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;He&mdash; looks like a hearty little fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>Sandor is spared from saying anything else as something\nsmall and fast collides with his middle. He looks down to see that the older\ndaughter has thrown her arms around him. He stares down at Nell in helpless confusion\nfor a moment before awkwardly patting the top of her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotten tall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have!&rdquo; Nell says proudly. She releases him and peers over\nher shoulder, realizing that Brenna has kept her distance, awkwardly twisting\nthe sleeves of her dress. Nell turns and takes her sister&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be\nshy! You remember Uncle Sandy, don&rsquo;t you? He saved you, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>A smile slowly forms on Brenna&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I &lsquo;member.&rdquo; She\nreleases her sister&rsquo;s hand and tentatively embraces Sandor as well. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it saving,&rdquo; Sandor says gruffly, recalling\nthe incident the children are referring to. </p><p>Though perhaps not as prissy and dainty as the average girl,\nBrenna is not nearly as rowdy or wild as her sister and mother. &nbsp;She prefers to wear dresses, insects send her\ninto panic, and she utterly <i>loathes </i>filth.\n</p><p>The last time Sandor visited, Nell and Brenna raced around in\nthe early spring with other youngsters. The melting snow and ice turned much of\nthe grass into a damp, muddy quagmire. &nbsp;Brenna\nwith her shorter legs was already lagging behind the other children when she\nslipped down one of the hills and tumbled into a pile of muck. She lay there rigid,\nher face frozen in a blank sort of horror Sandor associated with men who were slowly\nbleeding to death. </p><p>Sandor reached her first. He perfunctorily scooped her up\nand carried her away, back to solid ground and into her father&rsquo;s arms. </p><p>Gendry peered into Brenna&rsquo;s face anxiously while the Girl tentatively\nprobed her, looking for any serious injury. Sandor felt certain that the Girl\nmust have been thinking about her brother who had been thrown from a tower, his\nbody left shattered when he wasn&rsquo;t much older than Brenna. </p><p>After a long, terrifying moment, Brenna blinked\nand let out a pitiful, &ldquo;Blech!&rdquo;</p><p>Her parents half laughed, half sobbed in relief and brought\nher home to get cleaned up. &nbsp;</p><p>Sandor looks down at Brenna now, noticing that her dress has\nbeen tied into knots around her calves, presumably to spare it from dragging in\nthe dirt. Her alterations reveal that she&rsquo;s also wearing tall, sturdy boots. Sandor\nalmost smiles. Any other mother would be horrified by her attire. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you bring us presents?&rdquo; asks Nell hopefully.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Elyn</i>!&rdquo; the Girl\nsays at the same time Gendry says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rude.&rdquo;</p><p>Nell grins sheepishly. &ldquo;Well, he always brings us presents&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Sandor rolls his eyes and reaches into his pocket and hands\nNell a roughly made ring. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to wear this for a few years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty!&rdquo; she says, taking it from him and examining it. </p><p>&ldquo;See the hinge under the stone? There&rsquo;s a compartment and you\ncan put poison in there.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh!&rdquo; she says with much more enthusiasm and slips the ring\nonto her thumb but it&rsquo;s still quite loose.</p><p>The Girl chuckles and tells Nell that she can wear it on a\nchain until she grows more. Nell looks disappointed by that.</p><p> Less sure of Brenna&rsquo;s\ntastes, Sandor hesitantly hands her a wooden knight but her eyes light up as her\nsmall hand closes over it.</p><p>&ldquo;He can look after my dolls,&rdquo; she says excitedly. &ldquo;Like you\ndid for Mummy and Auntie Sansa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, little one,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll take good care\nof them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; the Girl prompts. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Uncle Sandy!&rdquo; Nell and Brenna say in unison. </p><p>Sandor doesn&rsquo;t answer them, simply scowls at the Girl, who muffles her laughter into her husband&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><hr /><p>Something dull digs into Sandor&rsquo;s side and he opens one of\nhis eyes the smallest of fractions. He didn&rsquo;t realize that he fell asleep. &nbsp;He sat on one of the low wooden tables to\nwatch the sunrise before breakfast. It was the first morning that felt like\nsummer in over a decade and he closed his eyes instinctively as he felt the\nsunlight touch his face. He turns his head this way and that, feeling stiff and\nsore. He can&rsquo;t remember the last time he slept outside. </p><p>Nell grins at him, a wooden sword clutched in her hands. That\nmust have been what she prodded him with. &ldquo;Sorry but you missed breakfast and Mum\nsays that you&rsquo;re so old now that we should make sure you&rsquo;re not dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not dead,&rdquo; he confirms, even though he feels like he might\nnot be far off. </p><p> &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve been\nwondering. What was your horse&rsquo;s name? The one you had when you and Mum tried\nto get to the Vale?&rdquo; Nell asks suddenly. &ldquo;Because when I tell the stories, I&rsquo;ve\nbeen calling him Grey Wind, like&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; he says slowly. A name he&rsquo;d partially chosen to\nirritate his father and also partially meant to sound unfriendly, to inspire\ndistance. &nbsp;The plan was both success and\nfailure; Sandor <i>loved</i> that horse and yet by some glorious miracle, managed to keep\nhim for more than twenty years, until he mercifully, peacefully succumbed to\nold age. The one constant in Sandor&rsquo;s life besides misery. Sandor buried Stranger himself, refusing all\noffers of help, even Ray&rsquo;s. The only living creature he&rsquo;d ever properly named.\nWith one exception. </p><p>Before he can stop it, he sees a flash of that fat barn cat\nwith its litter of kittens and he can almost feel <i>her</i> hand in his.</p><p><i>&ldquo;We should call that\none Shadow!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his free hand pointing to the kitten with all black\nfur.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No! You mustn&rsquo;t name\nthem, Sandor,&rdquo; she said despairingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get too attached to them.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He looked up at her,\nconfused.</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; they are very small and fragile.\nSomething might hurt them. If you name them, it will make you sadder to lose\nthem.&rdquo;</i></p><p>On some level, she must have suspected their fate all along\nbecause something&mdash; or more accurately, some<i>one&mdash;\ndid </i>come to hurt them a few days later. &nbsp;He clenches his fist and forces away the\nmemory of those dead kittens, their little bodies lying broken while their\nmother yowled. </p><p>Why is it that he remembers <i>that </i>so clearly and almost nothing about his sister? (Because<i> yes</i>, she <i>was </i>his sister and fuck his father for trying to tell him she was\njust some childhood playmate.) &nbsp;The only\nthings he can remember about her is how her hand felt in his, that she was the\nmiddle child, and how she begged him not to name those damn cats. But nothing\nelse. Not her face, not her age, or the things she liked to do. Not even her\nname. </p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stranger&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound very nice,&rdquo; Nell says, her voice\nbringing Sandor back to the present. She wrinkles her nose. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll keep\ncalling him Grey Wind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do that, child,&rdquo; he says, absently. &ldquo;The horse doesn&rsquo;t\ngive two shits what you call him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You said <i>shit</i>!&rdquo;\nShe giggles and she sounds so much like her mother that a shiver claws its way\nup Sandor&rsquo;s spine. It&rsquo;s surprisingly eerie to hear the Girl&rsquo;s voice come from\nthis younger, slightly discolored version of her. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard worse&mdash; from your parents.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she says matter-of-factly. &ldquo;But not from other adults.\n My friend Maris asked me if it was true\nthat Auntie Sansa killed Mad King Joffrey. I told her I didn&rsquo;t know but if she\ndid, he deserved it because Mum said he was a rat-faced cunt!&rdquo; </p><p>Sandor nearly chokes on a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Her mum got<i> really</i>\nangry! And looked at me like I just kicked a baby! But Jon Tarly&rsquo;s mother said\nthat if the worst thing that ever happens to your child is that she hears some\ncurse words, you should stop complaining and be grateful.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Fair point,&rdquo; says\nSandor.</p><p>&ldquo;The complaining part or the rat-faced cunt part?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p><p>Nell giggles again. This time, the laugh is her own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to practice now.&rdquo; She gestures\nwith her wooden sword, further down towards the trees where Brenna is gathering\nup blossoms into a long chain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting good,&rdquo; Nell says and turns on her\nheel and flounces away. </p><p>Hearing her sister&rsquo;s approach, Brenna looks up then sees\nSandor in the distance. &ldquo;Hullo, Uncle Sandy!&rdquo; Brenna chirps. </p><p>He raises his hand in greeting. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have knocked me on my back if I called you Sandy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; Sandor says, not bothering to look around, no longer\ntaken aback by the Girl&rsquo;s stealth. &ldquo;But you were never half as a sweet as those\ntwo.&rdquo; He tries to make his voice sound as offhand as possible and looks away. </p><p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; the Girl agrees as she settles down next to him,\ncradling her son close to her. &ldquo;They get that from their father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From <i>him</i>? He&rsquo;s\nthe only one I&rsquo;ve ever met more sullen than you. Quieter, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you don&rsquo;t bring out that side of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank fuck for that.&rdquo;</p><p>She snickers. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell them to call you Sandy,&rdquo; she\nsays, suddenly serious. &ldquo;Well, not exactly. &nbsp;When Brenna was learning to talk, Nell wanted\nto know why we all suddenly had that &lsquo;eee&rsquo; sound at the end of our names&mdash;\nMummy, Daddy, Nellie, Auntie Sansa, Uncle Jonny. I didn&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s just how\nyou talk to small children. &nbsp;But I said\nit was to help babies learn who their family members are. Who is part of the\npack and who isn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;So when their\nfriends said &lsquo;Sandor Clegane&rsquo; sounded scary, I think Nell wanted to make sure\neveryone knew that&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a screech and Brenna screams, &ldquo;Nell! NELL!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sandor and the Girl both tense, ready to spring to their\nfeet until their eyes fall on Brenna and see that there is no real danger. While\nwinding her way in between the branches of trees, Brenna somehow managed to walk\nface first into a mass of cobwebs. </p><p>&ldquo;Nell!&rdquo; Brenna cries again, tearing at the webs. &ldquo;Are they\nin my hair? I think they&rsquo;re in my hair!&rdquo;</p><p>Nell, who seems to have dropped her sword, reaches Brenna&rsquo;s\nside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Stay still.&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s astounding that\nyou managed to produce someone so&rdquo;&mdash; the word &ldquo;fussy&rdquo; is at the tip of Sandor&rsquo;s\ntongue, closely followed by &ldquo;girlish&rdquo; but those seem too harsh so he changes\ndirection &mdash;&ldquo;gentle.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I<i> know</i>,&rdquo; says the Girl, her voice full of affection as Nell combs\nher fingers through Brenna&rsquo;s hair and plucks out a live spider. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Nell\ndotes on Brenna. But I always worry that it won&rsquo;t last. They&rsquo;re so different.\nEvery day, I wake up and wonder if today&rsquo;s the day: that from now on they&rsquo;ll be\nlike Sansa and me when we were younger. We were so awful to each other&hellip; I don&rsquo;t\nknow how our mother stood it. I don&rsquo;t think I could.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different. There were six of you, and then the Greyjoy\nboy. It was only the two of <i>them</i> for\na long time&hellip; I&rsquo;m not saying there won&rsquo;t be days when they&rsquo;ll want to tear\neach other&rsquo;s hair out but&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>He waits for her to laugh at him, to make a comment about\nhim getting soft in his old age but she takes him by surprise. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she says, actually heartfelt and he finally meets\nher eye. They hold each other&rsquo;s gaze for a long moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold out your hands,&rdquo; the Girl says suddenly.</p><p>Sandor looks at her blankly then realizes that she wants him\nto take the baby. She can&rsquo;t be serious. &ldquo;Oh, fuck off.&rdquo;</p><p>She raises an eyebrow and glares at him but doesn&rsquo;t say\nanything. </p><p>Sandor eyes her, surprised to see that his refusal hurt her.\nBut then he thinks about the butcher&rsquo;s boy, the oldest and deepest wound\nbetween them, and what it means that she was willing to let him hold her son. &nbsp;A lump starts to form in Sandor&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;Go\non then,&rdquo; he mutters, extending his arms. He can&rsquo;t help but add, &ldquo;Even though\nyou&rsquo;re only doing it so you can take the piss out of me.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a loaf of\nbread! There, that&rsquo;s it. See? &nbsp;Not so bad\nis it, you miserable old shit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better company than his mother,&rdquo; Sandor retorts. &nbsp;</p><p>Even though he feels utterly ridiculous, he has to admit\nthat there is something miraculous about holding this tiny, delicate human\nbeing in his hands. After a moment, Sandor&rsquo;s novelty has worn off for the baby\nand he starts to fuss. &nbsp;</p><p>Sandor grimaces and holds the boy out to the Girl. </p><p>&ldquo;You could try rocking him.&rdquo;</p><p>Sandor grunts and the Girl smiles as she takes her child\nback, expertly soothing him. </p><p>&ldquo;Oooh, Nell! Nell, I can feel one near my ear! Get it!&rdquo;\nBrenna wails. Then adds quickly, &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t hurt it!&rdquo;</p><p>Little Brenna&rsquo;s screams for Nell echo in Sandor&rsquo;s ears,\ndistorting into a slightly deeper, more panicked, more desperate voice. His\nown.</p><p><i>As the fire drew\ncloser and closer to his face, he started to yell for her, his sister. Even\nthough she&rsquo;d been gone for ages, ever since their father told her to go find their\nbrother and make him come inside for dinner. Sandor couldn&rsquo;t help but call for her.\nBecause </i>she <i>was always the one who\nsaved him. </i>She<i> was the one who\npunched their brother&rsquo;s shoulder when he held Sandor in a headlock for too\nlong, when he knocked Sandor over and wouldn&rsquo;t let him back up.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nell! </i>Nell<i>!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Even when he could no\nlonger do anything but scream incoherently, her name continued to ring through\nhis head: Nell, Nell, Nell. &nbsp;</i></p><p>Eleanor. <i>Eleanor!</i>\nHis sister&rsquo;s name was Eleanor. She didn&rsquo;t like Nell after Gregor started\ncalling her &ldquo;Smelly Nellie&rdquo; but Sandor slipped when he was frightened.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good girl,&rdquo; Sandor says abruptly, watching Nell continue\nto carefully and patiently peel off strands of spider web from her younger\nsister. &ldquo;And a good big sister.&rdquo; He swallows. &ldquo;Like my sister was.&rdquo; His voice\nis steadier than he expected but also much quieter. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s not even sure if the Girl heard him. &ldquo;Nell,&rdquo;\nhe murmurs. &nbsp;But whether he meant Nell\nClegane or Nell Baratheon, he isn&rsquo;t sure. </p><p>&ldquo;Your sister was&mdash; real?&rdquo; the Girl asks.</p><p>He swallows and nods. &ldquo;Eleanor Clegane.&rdquo; A pause. &ldquo;First\nname on my list.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your &lsquo;list&rsquo;? Is it like <i>my</i>\nlist?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The opposite of yours,&rdquo; Sandor says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the list of\npeople&hellip;&rdquo; <i>I&rsquo;d die for</i>. &ldquo;The list of\npeople I&rsquo;d kill <i>for</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>The corner of her mouth turns up. &ldquo;Without having to pay\nyou, you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;No payment required.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting. How many people are on that list of yours?&rdquo;\nshe asks.</p><p>He looks away from her. &ldquo;About ten, still living.&rdquo; &nbsp; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear who&rsquo;s on it. Do I know any of them? &rdquo; </p><p>Sandor turns his head and sees something truly astonishing: Arya\nStark smiling at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he\nsays. &ldquo;If it will shut you up, I&rsquo;ll name them.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><b>A/N ii:</b> In the books, I feel like Sandor does have some\nattachment/detachment issues with names (threatening to beat Arya if she said\nMycah&rsquo;s name again has stayed with me) but in the show, it&rsquo;s dialed up to\neleven. He almost never uses people&rsquo;s names, and when he does it&rsquo;s almost\nalways mockingly. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know if it was\nintentional or not, but I always liked the contrast between Arya&rsquo;s obsession\nwith saying names and the way Sandor avoided them. I also thought it would be\ncool if he made a list that was the opposite of Arya&rsquo;s; the names of people he\nwants to protect. &nbsp;</p><p>I had the majority of this written in like, 2017 but I\nwasn&rsquo;t sure what to call the Clegane sister. And then Eleanor hit me with it&rsquo;s\nnice &ldquo;-or&rdquo; ending. Of course, like 2 days later, I discover that it&rsquo;s a pretty\npopular fanon name for her. Also Nell is an old nickname for Eleanor and the\ncoincidence gave me chills and a better reason for Sandor to remember her name.</p><p>As for the kids names&mdash; Elyn/Nell for Catelyn and Ned, Brenna\nfor Bran, Brienne, and Sansa, and Daren for Davos and Yoren. I wanted them to\nhave names that honored people important to Gendry and Arya without going full\nAlbus Severus Potter. &nbsp;:P</p>",

They&rsquo;re a fair\ndistance away and it&rsquo;s been well over a year since he&rsquo;s seen them, but he&rsquo;d\nknow them anywhere. They may have their father&rsquo;s hair and eyes, but otherwise,\nthey are entirely their mother. &nbsp;The\nolder one must be seven or eight. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s called Nell but that&rsquo;s short for\nsomething Sandor can&rsquo;t remember. And the younger one is&hellip; Brenna? Branna?\nBrenna. She looks about five. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He looks around for their mother and father, the Girl and\nthe lad. It strikes him now how stupid it is that he still thinks of them that\nway. &nbsp;The Girl would be about\ntwenty-eight by now and the lad is maybe thirty-three? They are long grown and\nhaven&rsquo;t been a girl and a lad for many years now. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>But&hellip; old habits. The Girl, the lad, Little Bird, the prince,\nthe king&hellip; the butcher&rsquo;s boy. &nbsp;Titles,\nepithets, those are easier than names. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s been for ages.

Gendry. </p>\n<p>The corner of Gendry&rsquo;s mouth turns upwards in surprise and\nhe makes his way over to Sandor. They don&rsquo;t speak; merely grasp each other&rsquo;s\nhands briefly and nod. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gendry turns in the direction to where his daughters are\nplaying. &ldquo;Girls?&rdquo; he calls, cupping his hands around his mouth to make himself\nlouder. &ldquo;Come see who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; </p>\n<p>The children&rsquo;s heads snap up in unison at the sound of their\nfather&rsquo;s voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, look!&rdquo; the older\none cries.

It&rsquo;s Uncle Sandy!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sandor&rsquo;s mind goes blank for a moment, unable to comprehend\nwhat he just heard. &nbsp;He feels an eye\ntwitch and his upper lip curl. He&rsquo;s not surprised they called him &ldquo;Uncle.&rdquo; The\nlast time he was here, the Girl&mdash; either unwilling or unable to explain their affiliation\nto her daughters&mdash;had referred to Sandor as her uncle. &nbsp;But <i>Sandy</i>?\nUncle <i>Sandy</i>? Seven<i> fucking </i>hells! </p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worse than the Hound. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p> He once heard that wheezing,\nold grand maester refer to a condition where something bursts in a man&rsquo;s brain\nand blood leaks inside his skull. Sandor wonders if that&rsquo;s happening to him\nnow. His eyes dart over to the lad, incredulous and silently demanding an\nexplanation. </p>\n<p>Gendry smiles ruefully and opens his mouth, but before he can\nspeak, a loud, almost manic giggle cuts through the air. </p>\n<p>Sandor whips his head around to find the Girl standing at\nhis other side, an infant in her arms. It&rsquo;s a boy, he thinks, but he can&rsquo;t be\nsure. He hadn&rsquo;t heard that she&rsquo;d had another child. She makes no move to\nfurther greet him, even as her laughter dies down into quiet chuckling.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Er, Nell likes to tell the other children stories about\nyour adventures with Arya and me,&rdquo; Gendry says when he can finally make his\nvoice heard. &ldquo;A few of them said that Sandor Clegane sounded like&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&mdash;A villain,&rdquo; the Girl offers, her laughter flaring up\nagain. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Right, so&hellip; Er, you became&mdash;&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Ser Sandy!&rdquo; the Girl manages to gasp between fits of snickering.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And whose idea was that, I wonder?&rdquo; Sandor grumbles, eyes\nnarrowed. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Girl raises and lowers one shoulder, still smirking. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Looking at her shit eating grin, Sandor realizes that he got\noff easy. Knowing the Girl, she probably entertained the idea of telling her\nchildren to call him Ser-Shit-for-Brains or Grand Maester Piss Crumpet. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; <br /></p>\n</p>",
