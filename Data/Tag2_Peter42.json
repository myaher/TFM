made your way passed peter\u2019s locker, spotting him and ned. you smiled, making eye contact with ned. you started making your way over, but mj arrived next to the pair, taking all of peter\u2019s attention.\u00a0</p><p>you glanced back and forth between ned and mj, ned sending you a soft smile as you walked passed your three friends, opting out on standing with them. ned nudged peter\u2019s foot, which caused him to look over at his best friend.</p><p>\u201cwhat?\u201d peter asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s missing here?\u201d ned asked, gesturing at your lack of presence. peter shrugged, attention turning back to mj, smiling as she talked to him about the latest book she read.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>ned rolled his eyes, leaning over and flicking his forehead,\u201ddude!\u201d</p><p>\u201cow! what?!\u201d peter asked, scrunching up his eyebrows.<br/></p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re serious right now?\u201d<br/></p><p>peter sent his friend a confused expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cuno,\u201d ned pointed to himself,\u201ddos,\u201d he pointed at peter,\u201dtres.\u201d he pointed at the empty air next to him.<br/></p><p>\u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cdude, c\u2019mon! you\u2019re seriously that fucking oblivious that you don\u2019t even realize y/n isn\u2019t standing with us.\u201d<br/></p><p>he shrugged,\u201dmaybe she\u2019s running late.\u201d</p><p>the bell cut the pair off and peter wrapped his arm around mj\u2019s shoulder,\u201di\u2019ll catch you at lunch.\u201d</p><p>ned rolled his eyes, walking down the hallway to where you were watching behind your locker door.</p><p>\u201che\u2019s becoming a real asshole.\u201d<br/></p><p>you chuckled,\u201dwell, that\u2019s not surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201ci mean, seriously! he didn\u2019t even realize that you weren\u2019t there!\u201d<br/></p><p>you felt the lump in your throat grow, nodding softly,\u201dyep..\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cy/n-\u201d</p><p>\u201ci\u2019m gonna be late to english.\u201d you sent him a reassuring smile, but ned watched with concern as you walked down the hallway, hand coming up to your cheek to wipe the tear away. he sighed, turning on his own heels to walk towards his own class.<br/></p><p>by the time lunch rolled around, you were convinced that peter parker had thought you were invisible. when you went to go sit in your usual spot in chemistry, mj was sitting there, peter watching her with love filled eyes.</p><p>you were happy for him, you really were, but there was this jealous ping that struck your heart anytime you saw the two of them together. it made your blood boil but made you want to sob at the same time.</p><p>you loved peter parker, but he was in love with michelle jones.</p><p>you took your usual spot next to ned, the next seat over being peter\u2019s. when he walked up to your table, mj\u2019s hand in his, he frowned before looking at you.</p><p>\u201chey, do you mind sitting on the other side of ned so mj can sit?\u201d</p><p>ned looked back at his best friend, disbelief written on his expression. you swallowed, feeling everyone at your table watch you get up from your spot, slamming your lunch tray down on the other side of ned, lettuce from your salad flinging onto flash.</p><p>\u201cyo, keep your school lettuce off the gucci-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cshut the fuck up, flash!\u201d you yelled, blood boiling at this point. it was the small things that ticked you off, from the fact that he didn\u2019t notice you this morning, to your seat in chemistry, and now your seat at lunch. yeah, you were pretty ticked off.</p><p>flash swallowed, nodding as he watched you pick at the greens. you finally threw your plastic fork down, grabbing your backpack from the table before taking your phone out of your back pocket.</p><p>\u201cwhere are you going?\u201d ned asked.<br/></p><p>\u201canywhere that isn\u2019t near peter fucking parker.\u201d you mumbled, peter\u2019s head snapping up at your mention of his name. he watched as you walked off, leaving the cafeteria.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201chold on, mj,\u201d he said, cutting her off in the middle of her sentence,\u201di\u2019ll be back, alright?\u201d<br/></p><p>she nodded, watching as her boyfriend ran after you. he watched as you wiped the tears from your eyes, making your way down the hall quickly.</p><p>\u201cy/n!\u201d he called,\u201dwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhy the fuck do you care?\u201d you asked, spinning around so fast that your backpack flung off your shoulder. he watched with wild eyes, seeing the mascara form at your undereyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cbecause i\u2019m your best friend&hellip;?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like it, peter!\u201d you were yelling, not really caring about the fact that teachers could probably hear you,\u201dyou\u2019ve been ignoring me since you got the balls to ask mj out! don\u2019t act like i haven\u2019t noticed because i have! jesus, you\u2019re so far up her ass i\u2019m surprised you\u2019re even standing here right now!\u201d</p><p>he pulled his eyebrows together,\u201dwhat\u2019re you talking about?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou know what i\u2019m talking about!\u201d you said, running a hand through your hair,\u201dned\u2019s been trying to get you to even acknowledge my existence lately and all i get in return is\u00a0\u2018hey can you move\u2019? really peter?\u201d<br/></p><p>he finally realized as he watched you storm up to him,\u201dy/n-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cand to think,\u201d you laughed,\u201di was actually falling for you, peter.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>his eyes widened, his heart twisting as you admitted your feelings for him.\u00a0</p><p>you let out a sob, hand weakly shoving against his shoulder. you wish you weren\u2019t so vulnerable when it came to him, but you couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>he grabbed your arm, pulling you into his chest,\u201dy/n-\u201d</p><p>you wrapped your arms around his torso loosely, sobbing into his sweater,\u201di love you, dammit.\u201d</p><p>he frowned, leaning his head on yours,\u201di know, i\u2019m sorry, y/n.\u201d</p><p>his voice was softer than a feather but it shattered you like glass. you buried your face into his chest, hiccuping after sobbing for a couple minutes. you pulled away, cheeks turning hot in embarrassment,\u201dgod, i\u2019m sorry, i\u2019m so sorry-\u201d</p><p>\u201cdon\u2019t even think about apologizing to me,\u201d he said,\u201dnever apologize for your feelings.\u201d<br/></p><p>you stayed silent for a moment,\u201dpromise me something, pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cmm?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201ctreat her right,\u201d you said,\u201dshe\u2019s a great girl, don\u2019t fuck it up.\u201d<br/></p><p>he nodded, pressing a kiss to your hair,\u201di promise.\u201d</p><hr><p><b><i>tagged:</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1blnsOEFmFRBooOs_BbVsr0qjNwvMuA8uJnjgL9JXr08/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">add

and ned. you smiled, making eye contact with ned. you started making your way over, but mj arrived next to the pair, taking all of peter\u2019s attention.\u00a0</p><p>you glanced back and forth between ned and mj, ned sending you a soft smile as you walked passed your three friends, opting out on standing with them. ned nudged peter\u2019s foot, which caused him to look over at his best friend.</p><p>\u201cwhat?\u201d peter asked.<br></p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s missing here?\u201d ned asked, gesturing at your lack of presence. peter shrugged, attention turning back to mj, smiling as she talked to him about the latest book she read.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>ned rolled his eyes, leaning over and flicking his forehead,\u201ddude!\u201d</p><p>\u201cow! what?!\u201d peter asked, scrunching up his eyebrows.<br></p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re serious right now?\u201d<br></p><p>peter sent his friend a confused expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cuno,\u201d ned pointed to himself,\u201ddos,\u201d he pointed at peter,\u201dtres.\u201d he pointed at the empty air next to him.<br></p><p>\u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cdude, c\u2019mon! you\u2019re seriously that fucking oblivious that you don\u2019t even realize y/n isn\u2019t standing with us.\u201d<br></p><p>he shrugged,\u201dmaybe she\u2019s running late.\u201d</p><p>the bell cut the pair off and peter wrapped his arm around mj\u2019s shoulder,\u201di\u2019ll catch you at lunch.\u201d</p><p>ned rolled his eyes, walking down the hallway to where you were watching behind your locker door.</p><p>\u201che\u2019s becoming a real asshole.\u201d<br></p><p>you chuckled,\u201dwell, that\u2019s not surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201ci mean, seriously! he didn\u2019t even realize that you weren\u2019t there!\u201d<br></p><p>you felt the lump in your throat grow, nodding softly,\u201dyep..\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cy/n-\u201d</p><p>\u201ci\u2019m gonna be late to english.\u201d you sent him a reassuring smile, but ned watched with concern as you walked down the hallway, hand coming up to your cheek to wipe the tear away. he sighed, turning on his own heels to walk towards his own class.<br></p><p>by the time lunch rolled around, you were convinced that peter parker had thought you were invisible. when you went to go sit in your usual spot in chemistry, mj was sitting there, peter watching her with love filled eyes.</p><p>you were happy for him, you really were, but there was this jealous ping that struck your heart anytime you saw the two of them together. it made your blood boil but made you want to sob at the same time.</p><p>you loved peter parker, but he was in love with michelle jones.</p><p>you took your usual spot next to ned, the next seat over being peter\u2019s. when he walked up to your table, mj\u2019s hand in his, he frowned before looking at you.</p><p>\u201chey, do you mind sitting on the other side of ned so mj can sit?\u201d</p><p>ned looked back at his best friend, disbelief written on his expression. you swallowed, feeling everyone at your table watch you get up from your spot, slamming your lunch tray down on the other side of ned, lettuce from your salad flinging onto flash.</p><p>\u201cyo, keep your school lettuce off the gucci-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cshut the fuck up, flash!\u201d you yelled, blood boiling at this point. it was the small things that ticked you off, from the fact that he didn\u2019t notice you this morning, to your seat in chemistry, and now your seat at lunch. yeah, you were pretty ticked off.</p><p>flash swallowed, nodding as he watched you pick at the greens. you finally threw your plastic fork down, grabbing your backpack from the table before taking your phone out of your back pocket.</p><p>\u201cwhere are you going?\u201d ned asked.<br></p><p>\u201canywhere that isn\u2019t near peter fucking parker.\u201d you mumbled, peter\u2019s head snapping up at your mention of his name. he watched as you walked off, leaving the cafeteria.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201chold on, mj,\u201d he said, cutting her off in the middle of her sentence,\u201di\u2019ll be back, alright?\u201d<br></p><p>she nodded, watching as her boyfriend ran after you. he watched as you wiped the tears from your eyes, making your way down the hall quickly.</p><p>\u201cy/n!\u201d he called,\u201dwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhy the fuck do you care?\u201d you asked, spinning around so fast that your backpack flung off your shoulder. he watched with wild eyes, seeing the mascara form at your undereyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cbecause i\u2019m your best friend\u2026?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like it, peter!\u201d you were yelling, not really caring about the fact that teachers could probably hear you,\u201dyou\u2019ve been ignoring me since you got the balls to ask mj out! don\u2019t act like i haven\u2019t noticed because i have! jesus, you\u2019re so far up her ass i\u2019m surprised you\u2019re even standing here right now!\u201d</p><p>he pulled his eyebrows together,\u201dwhat\u2019re you talking about?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou know what i\u2019m talking about!\u201d you said, running a hand through your hair,\u201dned\u2019s been trying to get you to even acknowledge my existence lately and all i get in return is\u00a0\u2018hey can you move\u2019? really peter?\u201d<br></p><p>he finally realized as he watched you storm up to him,\u201dy/n-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cand to think,\u201d you laughed,\u201di was actually falling for you, peter.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>his eyes widened, his heart twisting as you admitted your feelings for him.\u00a0</p><p>you let out a sob, hand weakly shoving against his shoulder. you wish you weren\u2019t so vulnerable when it came to him, but you couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>he grabbed your arm, pulling you into his chest,\u201dy/n-\u201d</p><p>you wrapped your arms around his torso loosely, sobbing into his sweater,\u201di love you, dammit.\u201d</p><p>he frowned, leaning his head on yours,\u201di know, i\u2019m sorry, y/n.\u201d</p><p>his voice was softer than a feather but it shattered you like glass. you buried your face into his chest, hiccuping after sobbing for a couple minutes. you pulled away, cheeks turning hot in embarrassment,\u201dgod, i\u2019m sorry, i\u2019m so sorry-\u201d</p><p>\u201cdon\u2019t even think about apologizing to me,\u201d he said,\u201dnever apologize for your feelings.\u201d<br></p><p>you stayed silent for a moment,\u201dpromise me something, pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cmm?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201ctreat her right,\u201d you said,\u201dshe\u2019s a great girl, don\u2019t fuck it up.\u201d<br></p><p>he nodded, pressing a kiss to your hair,\u201di promise.\u201d</p><hr><p><b><i>tagged:</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1blnsOEFmFRBooOs_BbVsr0qjNwvMuA8uJnjgL9JXr08/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">add

and ned. you smiled, making eye contact with ned. you started making your way over, but mj arrived next to the pair, taking all of peter\u2019s attention.\u00a0</p><p>you glanced back and forth between ned and mj, ned sending you a soft smile as you walked passed your three friends, opting out on standing with them. ned nudged peter\u2019s foot, which caused him to look over at his best friend.</p><p>\u201cwhat?\u201d peter asked.<br></p><p>\u201cwhat\u2019s missing here?\u201d ned asked, gesturing at your lack of presence. peter shrugged, attention turning back to mj, smiling as she talked to him about the latest book she read.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>ned rolled his eyes, leaning over and flicking his forehead,\u201ddude!\u201d</p><p>\u201cow! what?!\u201d peter asked, scrunching up his eyebrows.<br></p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re serious right now?\u201d<br></p><p>peter sent his friend a confused expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cuno,\u201d ned pointed to himself,\u201ddos,\u201d he pointed at peter,\u201dtres.\u201d he pointed at the empty air next to him.<br></p><p>\u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cdude, c\u2019mon! you\u2019re seriously that fucking oblivious that you don\u2019t even realize y/n isn\u2019t standing with us.\u201d<br></p><p>he shrugged,\u201dmaybe she\u2019s running late.\u201d</p><p>the bell cut the pair off and peter wrapped his arm around mj\u2019s shoulder,\u201di\u2019ll catch you at lunch.\u201d</p><p>ned rolled his eyes, walking down the hallway to where you were watching behind your locker door.</p><p>\u201che\u2019s becoming a real asshole.\u201d<br></p><p>you chuckled,\u201dwell, that\u2019s not surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201ci mean, seriously! he didn\u2019t even realize that you weren\u2019t there!\u201d<br></p><p>you felt the lump in your throat grow, nodding softly,\u201dyep..\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cy/n-\u201d</p><p>\u201ci\u2019m gonna be late to english.\u201d you sent him a reassuring smile, but ned watched with concern as you walked down the hallway, hand coming up to your cheek to wipe the tear away. he sighed, turning on his own heels to walk towards his own class.<br></p><p>by the time lunch rolled around, you were convinced that peter parker had thought you were invisible. when you went to go sit in your usual spot in chemistry, mj was sitting there, peter watching her with love filled eyes.</p><p>you were happy for him, you really were, but there was this jealous ping that struck your heart anytime you saw the two of them together. it made your blood boil but made you want to sob at the same time.</p><p>you loved peter parker, but he was in love with michelle jones.</p><p>you took your usual spot next to ned, the next seat over being peter\u2019s. when he walked up to your table, mj\u2019s hand in his, he frowned before looking at you.</p><p>\u201chey, do you mind sitting on the other side of ned so mj can sit?\u201d</p><p>ned looked back at his best friend, disbelief written on his expression. you swallowed, feeling everyone at your table watch you get up from your spot, slamming your lunch tray down on the other side of ned, lettuce from your salad flinging onto flash.</p><p>\u201cyo, keep your school lettuce off the gucci-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cshut the fuck up, flash!\u201d you yelled, blood boiling at this point. it was the small things that ticked you off, from the fact that he didn\u2019t notice you this morning, to your seat in chemistry, and now your seat at lunch. yeah, you were pretty ticked off.</p><p>flash swallowed, nodding as he watched you pick at the greens. you finally threw your plastic fork down, grabbing your backpack from the table before taking your phone out of your back pocket.</p><p>\u201cwhere are you going?\u201d ned asked.<br></p><p>\u201canywhere that isn\u2019t near peter fucking parker.\u201d you mumbled, peter\u2019s head snapping up at your mention of his name. he watched as you walked off, leaving the cafeteria.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201chold on, mj,\u201d he said, cutting her off in the middle of her sentence,\u201di\u2019ll be back, alright?\u201d<br></p><p>she nodded, watching as her boyfriend ran after you. he watched as you wiped the tears from your eyes, making your way down the hall quickly.</p><p>\u201cy/n!\u201d he called,\u201dwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhy the fuck do you care?\u201d you asked, spinning around so fast that your backpack flung off your shoulder. he watched with wild eyes, seeing the mascara form at your undereyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cbecause i\u2019m your best friend\u2026?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like it, peter!\u201d you were yelling, not really caring about the fact that teachers could probably hear you,\u201dyou\u2019ve been ignoring me since you got the balls to ask mj out! don\u2019t act like i haven\u2019t noticed because i have! jesus, you\u2019re so far up her ass i\u2019m surprised you\u2019re even standing here right now!\u201d</p><p>he pulled his eyebrows together,\u201dwhat\u2019re you talking about?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou know what i\u2019m talking about!\u201d you said, running a hand through your hair,\u201dned\u2019s been trying to get you to even acknowledge my existence lately and all i get in return is\u00a0\u2018hey can you move\u2019? really peter?\u201d<br></p><p>he finally realized as he watched you storm up to him,\u201dy/n-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cand to think,\u201d you laughed,\u201di was actually falling for you, peter.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>his eyes widened, his heart twisting as you admitted your feelings for him.\u00a0</p><p>you let out a sob, hand weakly shoving against his shoulder. you wish you weren\u2019t so vulnerable when it came to him, but you couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>he grabbed your arm, pulling you into his chest,\u201dy/n-\u201d</p><p>you wrapped your arms around his torso loosely, sobbing into his sweater,\u201di love you, dammit.\u201d</p><p>he frowned, leaning his head on yours,\u201di know, i\u2019m sorry, y/n.\u201d</p><p>his voice was softer than a feather but it shattered you like glass. you buried your face into his chest, hiccuping after sobbing for a couple minutes. you pulled away, cheeks turning hot in embarrassment,\u201dgod, i\u2019m sorry, i\u2019m so sorry-\u201d</p><p>\u201cdon\u2019t even think about apologizing to me,\u201d he said,\u201dnever apologize for your feelings.\u201d<br></p><p>you stayed silent for a moment,\u201dpromise me something, pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cmm?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201ctreat her right,\u201d you said,\u201dshe\u2019s a great girl, don\u2019t fuck it up.\u201d<br></p><p>he nodded, pressing a kiss to your

target=\"_blank\">insp</a>.</p><hr /><p>you made your way down the halls of midtown, bumping passed the people who took up most of the hallway. you made your way passed peter&rsquo;s locker, spotting him and ned. you smiled, making eye contact with ned. you started making your way over, but mj arrived next to the pair, taking all of peter&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp;</p><p>you glanced back and forth between ned and mj, ned sending you a soft smile as you walked passed your three friends, opting out on standing with them. ned nudged peter&rsquo;s foot, which caused him to look over at his best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;what?&rdquo; peter asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s missing here?&rdquo; ned asked, gesturing at your lack of presence. peter shrugged, attention turning back to mj, smiling as she talked to him about the latest book she read.<br /></p><p>ned rolled his eyes, leaning over and flicking his forehead,&rdquo;dude!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;ow! what?!&rdquo; peter asked, scrunching up his eyebrows.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re serious right now?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>peter sent his friend a confused expression.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;uno,&rdquo; ned pointed to himself,&rdquo;dos,&rdquo; he pointed at peter,&rdquo;tres.&rdquo; he pointed at the empty air next to him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;what does that mean?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;dude, c&rsquo;mon! you&rsquo;re seriously that fucking oblivious that you don&rsquo;t even realize y/n isn&rsquo;t standing with us.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>he shrugged,&rdquo;maybe she&rsquo;s running late.&rdquo;</p><p>the bell cut the pair off and peter wrapped his arm around mj&rsquo;s shoulder,&rdquo;i&rsquo;ll catch you at lunch.&rdquo;</p><p>ned rolled his eyes, walking down the hallway to where you were watching behind your locker door.</p><p>&ldquo;he&rsquo;s becoming a real asshole.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>you chuckled,&rdquo;well, that&rsquo;s not surprising.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;i mean, seriously! he didn&rsquo;t even realize that you weren&rsquo;t there!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>you felt the lump in your throat grow, nodding softly,&rdquo;yep..&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;y/n-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m gonna be late to english.&rdquo; you sent him a reassuring smile, but ned watched with concern as you walked down the hallway, hand coming up to your cheek to wipe the tear away. he sighed, turning on his own heels to walk towards his own class.<br /></p><p>by the time lunch rolled around, you were convinced that peter parker had thought you were invisible. when you went to go sit in your usual spot in chemistry, mj was sitting there, peter watching her with love filled eyes.</p><p>you were happy for him, you really were, but there was this jealous ping that struck your heart anytime you saw the two of them together. it made your blood boil but made you want to sob at the same time.</p><p>you loved peter parker, but he was in love with michelle jones.</p><p>you took your usual spot next to ned, the next seat over being peter&rsquo;s. when he walked up to your table, mj&rsquo;s hand in his, he frowned before looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;hey, do you mind sitting on the other side of ned so mj can sit?&rdquo;</p><p>ned looked back at his best friend, disbelief written on his expression. you swallowed, feeling everyone at your table watch you get up from your spot, slamming your lunch tray down on the other side of ned, lettuce from your salad flinging onto flash.</p><p>&ldquo;yo, keep your school lettuce off the gucci-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;shut the fuck up, flash!&rdquo; you yelled, blood boiling at this point. it was the small things that ticked you off, from the fact that he didn&rsquo;t notice you this morning, to your seat in chemistry, and now your seat at lunch. yeah, you were pretty ticked off.</p><p>flash swallowed, nodding as he watched you pick at the greens. you finally threw your plastic fork down, grabbing your backpack from the table before taking your phone out of your back pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;where are you going?&rdquo; ned asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;anywhere that isn&rsquo;t near peter fucking parker.&rdquo; you mumbled, peter&rsquo;s head snapping up at your mention of his name. he watched as you walked off, leaving the cafeteria.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;hold on, mj,&rdquo; he said, cutting her off in the middle of her sentence,&rdquo;i&rsquo;ll be back, alright?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>she nodded, watching as her boyfriend ran after you. he watched as you wiped the tears from your eyes, making your way down the hall quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;y/n!&rdquo; he called,&rdquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;why the fuck do you care?&rdquo; you asked, spinning around so fast that your backpack flung off your shoulder. he watched with wild eyes, seeing the mascara form at your undereyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;because i&rsquo;m your best friend&hellip;?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t feel like it, peter!&rdquo; you were yelling, not really caring about the fact that teachers could probably hear you,&rdquo;you&rsquo;ve been ignoring me since you got the balls to ask mj out! don&rsquo;t act like i haven&rsquo;t noticed because i have! jesus, you&rsquo;re so far up her ass i&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;re even standing here right now!&rdquo;</p><p>he pulled his eyebrows together,&rdquo;what&rsquo;re you talking about?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;you know what i&rsquo;m talking about!&rdquo; you said, running a hand through your hair,&rdquo;ned&rsquo;s been trying to get you to even acknowledge my existence lately and all i get in return is&nbsp;&lsquo;hey can you move&rsquo;? really peter?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>he finally realized as he watched you storm up to him,&rdquo;y/n-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;and to think,&rdquo; you laughed,&rdquo;i was actually falling for you, peter.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>his eyes widened, his heart twisting as you admitted your feelings for him.&nbsp;</p><p>you let out a sob, hand weakly shoving against his shoulder. you wish you weren&rsquo;t so vulnerable when it came to him, but you couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p><p>he grabbed your arm, pulling you into his chest,&rdquo;y/n-&rdquo;</p><p>you wrapped your arms around his torso loosely, sobbing into his sweater,&rdquo;i love you, dammit.&rdquo;</p><p>he frowned, leaning his head on yours,&rdquo;i know, i&rsquo;m sorry, y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>his voice was softer than a feather but it shattered you like glass. you buried your face into his chest, hiccuping after sobbing for a couple minutes. you pulled away, cheeks turning hot in embarrassment,&rdquo;god, i&rsquo;m sorry, i&rsquo;m so sorry-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t even think about apologizing to me,&rdquo; he said,&rdquo;never apologize for your feelings.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>you stayed silent for a moment,&rdquo;promise me something, pete?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;mm?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;treat her right,&rdquo; you said,&rdquo;she&rsquo;s a great girl, don&rsquo;t fuck it up.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>he nodded, pressing a kiss to your hair,&rdquo;i promise.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><b><i>tagged:</i></b></p><p><a

She let her short light brown hair flow with the wind as she meditated. She smelled the saltiness of the water, feeling the wind bring it up to kiss her cheeks from where she sat on her families dock. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she felt this calm. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She knew her great grandfather had travelled back in time to stay with her great grandmother, and that most of her memories were messed up. He told her himself since he wanted her to know of his past that was in the future. Sure she could see the resemblance in the history books that she read for fun, but she never really thought of it until he brought it up. </p><p>Since her family was one of the smartest thanks to her Great-grandmother she didn\u2019t attend public school, or any school at all really. Sydney Rogers was a mystery to the world just the way her parent\u2019s wanted. Not that she minded all too much; she spent her time reading up on her great-grandfather\u2019s past rendezvous, and all about Tony Stark\u2019s findings in the scientific field, only having access because her Grandpa Steve asked Pepper for the access codes to his files. Pepper allowed it because she figured that someone is gonna need to continue to further Tony\u2019s work and who better than someone that is the descendant of Steve Rogers.</p><p>However, Sydney\u2019s relaxation didn\u2019t last long before her father called her for supper, which completely ruined her concentration on the world around her and put her back in a slightly sour mood. </p><p>She sighed and pulled herself up from the ground her blue eyes opening as she turned to head inside for dinner.</p><p>~~With Sam and Bucky~~</p><p>\u201cBuck, there\u2019s no way we can find someone that doesn\u2019t want to be found,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWell then Steve is just gonna have to tell us now isn\u2019t he?\u201d Bucky asked as he barged into Steve\u2019s room. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop him,\u201d Sam warned Steve.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me who Anthony and Sydney Rogers are, and why you didn\u2019t tell us you had a grandson and great-granddaughter sooner,\u201d Bucky demanded. </p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow at Bucky noting his attitude. \u201cMy grandson asked me to keep him and his family out of all the \u2018crazy.\u2019 The most he has asked of me is that I get access to Tony\u2019s files for his daughter to study since she\u2019s gotten bored learning all she can about history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk but where are they?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t remember I haven\u2019t been there in a very long time. You could ask Peter, I know he and Sydney have been pen-pals. Sydney said she wanted to learn more about his spider powers,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling us that your great-granddaughter is some kinda Tony Stark super genius?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah really,\u201d Bucky said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what she is, but what I do know is that Pepper has given up a lot of money to let Sydney become the new Tony Stark,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess it\u2019s time to go find Parker,\u201d Sam said. Bucky nodded and they bid their farewells to Steve and headed to the small apartment in Queens.</p><p>Once the two arrived Peter\u2019s Aunt May answered the door and let them go see Peter who was in his room.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Bucky, Mr. Sam w-what are you doing here?\u201d Peter asked hiding the piece of paper he was writing on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to hide Peter?\u201d Sam asked</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you writing to Sydney?\u201d Bucky asked.</p><p>\u201cH-how did you know?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cWe asked Steve about Sydney, and her father,\u201d Sam said. Peter nodded. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find her,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cSo what\u2019s her address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uh its 04 Freedom Drive in upstate New York,\u201d Peter said already planning on going there today.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Sam rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was planning on going there anyway you\u2019re welcome to join me. She just wanted notes on the progression of my powers,\u201d Peter said smiling grabbing his backpack and the piece of paper.</p><p>The three drove up to Sydney\u2019s house, and they were greeted by a fairly normal house other than the fact that it looked like a mansion. Peter smiled and ran up to the door knocking just like he normally does on the weekends.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d A soft female voice asked.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker.\u201d </p><p>The door swung open and revealed a short girl, around five foot two, with bright blue eyes, short light brown hair, thick rimmed glasses and a small smile on her face. What shocked the two older men was the fact that her father stood not too far behind her, and he looked just like Steve post-serum. </p><p>Sydney pulled Peter into the house rushing him to her lab in the basement leaving her father to deal with the two grown men that stood on the porch.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you two?\u201d Her father asked.</p><p>\u201cUh sir we\u2019re just wondering if we could speak to your daughter,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cYou see since the Avengers are a bit sparse these days we wanted to speak to her about joining. Not for combat, but for helping develop new gear, and organizing missions,\u201d Sam continued.</p><p>\u201cCome in, I\u2019ll speak to you about this. My name is Anthony by the way,\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cJames, but you can call me Bucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel, but I prefer Sam.\u201d</p><p>As the adults talked Peter and Sydney were calmly setting him up on her scanner. She was typing while he put on the two bracelets that had wires coming off of them.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s all of his files treating you?\u201d Peter asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat! I know its sad that he\u2019s gone, but I love learning everything I can from him,\u201d she said smiling. Peter smiled watching her spin around in her lab chair to her big computer.</p><p>\u201cAlright, scan commencing in 5\u2026 4\u2026 3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026\u201d she pointed to him and he felt a tiny shock in both wrists and then everything was done. \u201cAlright, cool we&rsquo;re done. Thanks so much Peter! I know you don&rsquo;t want many people to know you&rsquo;re Spiderman so this really means a lot.\u201d</p><p>The three men that were conversing upstairs came down to see Sydney and she was pulling out a microchip to give to Peter.</p><p>\u201cI developed something that Mr. Stark had planned in a backup file for after the fight.

Not for combat, but for helping develop new gear, and organizing missions,&rdquo; Sam continued.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in, I&rsquo;ll speak to you about this. My name is Anthony by the way,&rdquo; He said.</p><p>&ldquo;James, but you can call me Bucky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Samuel, but I prefer Sam.&rdquo;</p><p>As the adults talked Peter and Sydney were calmly setting him up on her scanner. She was typing while he put on the two bracelets that had wires coming off of them.</p><p>&ldquo;So how&rsquo;s all of his files treating you?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Great! I know its sad that he&rsquo;s gone, but I love learning everything I can from him,&rdquo; she said smiling. Peter smiled watching her spin around in her lab chair to her big computer.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, scan commencing in 5&hellip; 4&hellip; 3&hellip; 2&hellip; 1&hellip;&rdquo; she pointed to him and he felt a tiny shock in both wrists and then everything was done. &ldquo;Alright, cool we&rsquo;re done. Thanks so much Peter! I know you don&rsquo;t want many people to know you&rsquo;re Spiderman so this really means a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>The three men that were conversing upstairs came down to see Sydney and she was pulling out a microchip to give to Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;I developed something that Mr. Stark had planned in a backup file for after the fight. I hope you like it cuz this is the only way for me to thank you. I already installed it in Ms. Potts house for her and Morgan so come here,&rdquo; she said waving him over.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I see your suit?&rdquo; Peter handed her his suit and she pulled out Karen&rsquo;s chip and replaced it with the new one. </p><p>&ldquo;Try it out,&rdquo; she said. Peter took the garment and stepped in letting the mech suit form to his body. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No way&hellip;.&rdquo; Peter trailed off covering, what would be, his mouth. </p><p>The three adults watched. Her father was smiling proudly, while Sam and Bucky watched in shock. They hadn&rsquo;t thought that she would be this advanced when they first found out about her, but this was just on a different scale.</p>",

The bus hissed to a stop in front of me, and I stepped up without taking my eyes off my phone. I didn\u2019t need to listen to the other stop names: it was 4 stops to my apartment. I turned up my music as a baby started to cry behind me. </p><p>Four stops later I hopped off the bus, and began to walk down the street as I continued to scroll. I took a left towards the coffee shop a few blocks from my apartment and walked up the block only looking up to place my hand on the door.</p><p>I ran into the door and looked up. This was not my coffee shop, instead I was looking into a dark restaurant with a health department notice taped in the window. I looked around at my surroundings and irritably sighed as I closed the article on my phone and pulled up my maps. I had no clue where I was. I retraced my steps back to the bus stop and looked to see when the next bus would arrive and checked my phone. The next bus wouldn\u2019t be here for an hour and a half. It was starting to get dark and I began to get nervous as I looked around. I took a deep breath and decided to walk home. Stuffing my hands in my pockets I began the long walk home.</p><p>After a couple of blocks, I began to feel like I was being watched. I looked around and noticed a white car with tinted windows turn onto the otherwise empty street. A man got out of the back seat in front of the bodega behind me.</p><p>I turned as the car drove past me and stopped at the stop sign and I let out a sigh of relief as I felt my shoulders relax. </p><p>Suddenly, another man jumped out of the car and started to walk towards me. I heard footsteps behind me get closer and felt panic sweep over me. I turned toward the street and stepped off the side walk as I felt a hand grab my elbow. I tried to tug my arm out of his grip, but he pulled me back to the side walk as I struggled against him.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me!\u201d I shouted at him, hearing the panic in my voice as I swung my free arm to punch at him. He grabbed my other wrist and I fought against him as he began to pull me toward the car as the other man continued to walk towards us. </p><p>I started to scream for help and the man I was wrestling against pulled me toward him and clamped his hand over my mouth. I bit down onto his finger and heard him yell as I felt the warm salty taste of blood in my mouth. He let me go, and I turned to run away. I screamed as I felt the other man grab me by my hair and began to cry. My hands wrapped around the hand tangled in my hair as the man I bit slapped me across the face.</p><p>I continued to struggle as I was dragged towards the car, tears streaming down my face. The man pulling my hair opened the car door and tried to pull me down into the car with him but I braced my self against the door frame as he tugged on my hair.</p><p>\u201cGrab her legs,\u201d he said, and I began to kick at him as he tried to grab my ankles. The grip on my hair tightened and I shouted in pain as my head was yanked back against the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStop- hgugh! struggling you stupid-mph- brat.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden there was a loud <i>thwip</i>, and the car door slammed on the man\u2019s hand. There was a sticky sheet of what looked like stringy plastic wrap holding his hand to the door. He screamed and immediately let go of my hair, and the man that had been trying to grab my ankles stood up just before the same stringy substance wrapped around him and slammed him against the car. His knees buckled but he was stuck to the car from whatever that stuff was. </p><p>Stumbling backwards, I tripped over my attacker\u2019s shoe and felt strong arms stop me from falling and immediately began to fight against them.</p><p>\u201cHey-ouch- stop! I-ow! Just-mph\u201d I turned and took a few clumsy steps backwards. I was standing in front of Spiderman. \u201cIt\u2019s okay! I\u2019m not gonna hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I felt my shoulders relax, only to jump away from the car as the driver opened the door. It slammed shut as Spiderman shot a string at him from his hand. </p><p>\u201cJust a sec,\u201d I heard him say as he leapt up on to the car and began to shoot that stuff around the car, making sure the doors wouldn\u2019t open again. He jumped off the car And landed right in front of me. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asked. His voice sounded&hellip; familiar. I tilted my head trying to place his voice. He couldn\u2019t have been much older than me. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I said, glancing back at the car. I felt a lump in my throat and took a deep, shaky breath. \u201cAs okay as someone can be after almost being abducted.\u201d </p><p>He turned to look down the street and looked back at me.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, holding his hand out. \u201cLet me take you home.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at his hand, and nervously bit my lip. I looked back up at him and he nodded. I tentatively placed my hand in his, and he pulled me into his chest. </p><p>\u201cHang on to me,\u201d he said and I wrapped my arms around his neck, blushing as he wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me against him. </p><p>He lifted his arm and before I knew it we were soaring into the air. I gasped loudly and his grip tightened as he held me against him. I pressed my face into the crook of his neck, clinging to him for dear life.</p><p>\u201cCan I get some directions?\u201d he asked into my ear. </p><p>\u201cOh-uh- yeah,\u201d I said, turning my head as he carefully shifted me so I could see where we were going. I began to direct him and we flew through the streets, and every so often I\u2019d feel his grip tighten around my waist. After about 5 minutes, I could see my apartment building. </p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d I said nodding towards the brick building. \u201cThe front door is on the other side of the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take you straight to your room if you want,\u201d he said as we got closer. \u201cIf you\u2019ve missed curfew or something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe front door is fine,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t stop trying to place his voice, I\u2019d heard that voice from somewhere before. </p><p>He nodded and swung us around the building and into an alley across the street. My feet touched the ground and I felt his other hand on my waist, stabilizing me as I stumbled a little. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said sheepishly as I let go of him and took a few steps away from him.</p><p>\u201cWell, you were a long way from home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t gonna let-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not for the lift,\u201d I said, trying to decide what to tell my parents. \u201cThose guys-I don\u2019t know what I\u2026\u201d</p><p>I trailed off and looked at the ground as I felt tears building in the corners of my eyes. I saw him moving in my peripherals and flinched when I felt his hand on my shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I looked up at the man in the mask. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now. You\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at the apartments and Spiderman\u2019s hand left my shoulder. When I turned back he was half way up the building. </p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d I shouted, making him look down at me. He seemed to freeze above me and he muttered something under his breath.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah! Yeah, of course you do!\u201d he said as he climbed the rest of the way up the building.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d </p><p>I took a few steps back so I could still see him as he climbed over the roof and looked over the edge at me. The white eye pieces on his mask narrowed as if he was scrutinizing me. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman!\u201d </p><p>And then he was gone, leaving me alone in the darkened alley. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>I decided not to tell anyone what had happened. Even if I did, who was going to believe my story? I walked up the steps to Midtown High and sighed as I weaved in and out of students. </p><p><i>Same shit as always, </i>I thought to myself. I reached my locker and began to sort through what I needed for first and second period. </p><p>Someone walked up from behind me and leaned against the locker next to me. I looked over and smiled at MJ. She looked irritated, but then again, she always looks like that.</p><p>\u201cHave you done the calc study guide yet?\u201d she asked, crossing her arms. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I huffed fishing a binder out of my backpack. \u201cBut keep reminding me. If I don\u2019t get at least an A- I\u2019m going to fail the class.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be rude,\u201d she said uncrossing her arms as I shut my locker. We started down the hall. \u201cAnd a B is not failing.\u201d</p><p>At the end of the hall I caught sight of Ned and Peter and immediately felt my stomach to a flip. </p><p>MJ noticed. </p><p>\u201cMaybe Peter can help,\u201d she said elbowing me in the ribs. </p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I said elbowing her back. </p><p>\u201cHey, just a suggestion,\u201d she said as I opened the door to our biology classroom. \u201cIf you\u2019re dead set on that A- and I know you are- it might be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMJ,\u201d I said seriously. \u201cDrop it.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged at me and we sat next to each other on the same lab bench. We quipped back and forth while more students took their seats. Peter and Ned sat across from us and I caught Peter\u2019s eye as he pulled out the chair in front of MJ. He smiled at me as he sat down. I smiled and quickly looked away to hide my pink cheeks. </p><p>As class started I immediately lost focus and rested my chin in the palm of my hand. As much as I loved the idea of Peter tutoring me, I knew I\u2019d never be able to focus. I glanced over at him as he copied notes from the board. His curly brown hair covering his eyes as he leaned over his notebook. Every now and then he\u2019d look up and rest his chin in the palm of his hand and I could briefly see the light hit his brown eyes. </p><p>My butt vibrated, pulling me back to the classroom. I glanced up to check that our teacher wasn\u2019t looking and pulled my phone out of my back pocket. It was a text from MJ. </p><p>MJ: ur eyes glaze over when ur day dreaming</p><p>I looked over to see her discretely holding her notebook so I could clearly see what she\u2019d drawn. It was a cartoon version of me with hearts for eyes and drool dripping from my mouth. I texted back the middle finger emoji and put my phone in my backpack, signaling to MJ that I was done talking about Peter\u2026 for now. </p><p>I continued to day dream and vaguely heard our teacher wrapping up his lecture and going over the specifics for the project. </p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s due a week from today, so next Wednesday,\u201d he said, reaching for a sheet of paper on his desk. He began reading names from his list and two by two students stood up and met at the door to leave. </p><p>\u201cMichelle -Ned\u2026\u201d </p><p>Ned stood up in front of me and MJ didn\u2019t move, continuing to scroll through her phone. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)- Peter\u2026\u201d </p><p>My eyes widened and I felt my cheeks begin to get warm. I glanced at Peter and we both sheepishly smiled at each other. Out of the corner of my eye<i> </i>I could see MJ as she turned to look at me with that stupid shit eating grin on her face. She got up so quickly it was almost comical, and she made a big show about getting Ned to walk with her to \u201cdiscuss the project.\u201d </p><p>I stood up and turned to meet Peter at the end of the lab bench. We awkwardly greeted each other and began to leave class, our shoulders brushing against each other every couple steps. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been reading a couple articles,\u201d I said, as I turned down the hall towards my locker. My heart fluttered as I noted that this had been the first one-on-one conversation I\u2019d ever had with him. \u201cBut if you have something else, we can do that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really looked into anything, yet,\u201d he said, glancing up from the floor at me. When his eyes met mine I felt my cheeks getting warm again and quickly looked away. </p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it more after school,\u201d he said, quickly. \u201dDo you want to work on it at my place or your place- unless you\u2019re not comfortable with- we can meet in a more public-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe can go to your place, if you want?\u201d I said uncertainly. \u201cMy parents are super nosy and we\u2019d never get anything done..\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll meet up after school?\u201d he asked, pulling out his phone. He seemed nervous but he was also smiling, so I couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking. \u201cDo I already have your number?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and we exchanged numbers as we rounded the corner. I looked up and saw MJ and Ned standing at my locker whispering to each other. As soon as we were within ear shot the stopped talking and there was an awkward silence as we all stared at each other. </p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ned blurted nervously. MJ rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSmooth, Ned. Smooth,\u201d she said. He looked a little embarrassed and quickly changed the subject. </p><p>\u201cAre we gonna start the new lego set I got after school today?\u201d Ned asked Peter. \u201cI finally got the Millennium Falcon.\u201d</p><p>I opened my locker and saw Peter scratching the back of his neck out of the corner of my eye. </p><p>\u201cActually, (Y/N) and I are gonna start working on our project after school,\u201d Peter said. </p><p>I shut my locker and turned around as Ned was about to start complaining but MJ cut in. </p><p>\u201cMaybe you can help (Y/N) with her calc study guide,\u201d she said. I glared at her as Peter turned to look at her. \u201cThe test is Friday and she won\u2019t shut up about how she\u2019s gonna fail.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf you want I can help you with the study guide today, and we can start on the project today and finish it over the weekend,\u201d he said, looking back at me. I glanced at MJ behind Peter\u2019s back and she gave me a subtle thumbs up. </p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 sure,\u201d I said tucking a stray hair behind my ear. My cheeks felt like they were burning as he smiled back at me. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t mind do you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Ned said. \u201cPet-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s no trouble,\u201d Peter said quickly, glancing at Ned. \u201cWe have to get going- to, uh, class.\u201d</p><p>Ned looked confused, but didn\u2019t respond and began to follow Peter. I watched them leave and turned back to MJ who was grinning back down at me. </p><p>\u201cNot a single word,\u201d I said as I turned away from my locker and she followed me off to second period, cackling. </p>",

Also, I\u2019ve been very uncreative and I\u2019m open to people sending me requests but I don\u2019t want the expectation to be that I will fulfill all requests. So yeah, please give me feed back b/c while this is a creative out let for me I\u2019d love to know what people think.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/13b531ff44409610b829d49a7f4982b5/tumblr_inline_pro7a8Rspe1wqrypt_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p>I walked down the street towards the bus stop, my eyes glued to my phone as I read through a scientific article I needed for a project and I shoved my earbuds in and began blasting a new band I\u2019d recently heard about. The bus hissed to a stop in front of me, and I stepped up without taking my eyes off my phone. I didn\u2019t need to listen to the other stop names: it was 4 stops to my apartment. I turned up my music as a baby started to cry behind me. </p><p>Four stops later I hopped off the bus, and began to walk down the street as I continued to scroll. I took a left towards the coffee shop a few blocks from my apartment and walked up the block only looking up to place my hand on the door.</p><p>I ran into the door and looked up. This was not my coffee shop, instead I was looking into a dark restaurant with a health department notice taped in the window. I looked around at my surroundings and irritably sighed as I closed the article on my phone and pulled up my maps. I had no clue where I was. I retraced my steps back to the bus stop and looked to see when the next bus would arrive and checked my phone. The next bus wouldn\u2019t be here for an hour and a half. It was starting to get dark and I began to get nervous as I looked around. I took a deep breath and decided to walk home. Stuffing my hands in my pockets I began the long walk home.</p><p>After a couple of blocks, I began to feel like I was being watched. I looked around and noticed a white car with tinted windows turn onto the otherwise empty street. A man got out of the back seat in front of the bodega behind me.</p><p>I turned as the car drove past me and stopped at the stop sign and I let out a sigh of relief as I felt my shoulders relax. </p><p>Suddenly, another man jumped out of the car and started to walk towards me. I heard footsteps behind me get closer and felt panic sweep over me. I turned toward the street and stepped off the side walk as I felt a hand grab my elbow. I tried to tug my arm out of his grip, but he pulled me back to the side walk as I struggled against him.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me!\u201d I shouted at him, hearing the panic in my voice as I swung my free arm to punch at him. He grabbed my other wrist and I fought against him as he began to pull me toward the car as the other man continued to walk towards us. </p><p>I started to scream for help and the man I was wrestling against pulled me toward him and clamped his hand over my mouth. I bit down onto his finger and heard him yell as I felt the warm salty taste of blood in my mouth. He let me go, and I turned to run away. I screamed as I felt the other man grab me by my hair and began to cry. My hands wrapped around the hand tangled in my hair as the man I bit slapped me across the face.</p><p>I continued to struggle as I was dragged towards the car, tears streaming down my face. The man pulling my hair opened the car door and tried to pull me down into the car with him but I braced my self against the door frame as he tugged on my hair.</p><p>\u201cGrab her legs,\u201d he said, and I began to kick at him as he tried to grab my ankles.

The bus hissed to a stop in front of me, and I stepped up without taking my eyes off my phone. I didn\u2019t need to listen to the other stop names: it was 4 stops to my apartment. I turned up my music as a baby started to cry behind me. </p><p>Four stops later I hopped off the bus, and began to walk down the street as I continued to scroll. I took a left towards the coffee shop a few blocks from my apartment and walked up the block only looking up to place my hand on the door.</p><p>I ran into the door and looked up. This was not my coffee shop, instead I was looking into a dark restaurant with a health department notice taped in the window. I looked around at my surroundings and irritably sighed as I closed the article on my phone and pulled up my maps. I had no clue where I was. I retraced my steps back to the bus stop and looked to see when the next bus would arrive and checked my phone. The next bus wouldn\u2019t be here for an hour and a half. It was starting to get dark and I began to get nervous as I looked around. I took a deep breath and decided to walk home. Stuffing my hands in my pockets I began the long walk home.</p><p>After a couple of blocks, I began to feel like I was being watched. I looked around and noticed a white car with tinted windows turn onto the otherwise empty street. A man got out of the back seat in front of the bodega behind me.</p><p>I turned as the car drove past me and stopped at the stop sign and I let out a sigh of relief as I felt my shoulders relax. </p><p>Suddenly, another man jumped out of the car and started to walk towards me. I heard footsteps behind me get closer and felt panic sweep over me. I turned toward the street and stepped off the side walk as I felt a hand grab my elbow. I tried to tug my arm out of his grip, but he pulled me back to the side walk as I struggled against him.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me!\u201d I shouted at him, hearing the panic in my voice as I swung my free arm to punch at him. He grabbed my other wrist and I fought against him as he began to pull me toward the car as the other man continued to walk towards us. </p><p>I started to scream for help and the man I was wrestling against pulled me toward him and clamped his hand over my mouth. I bit down onto his finger and heard him yell as I felt the warm salty taste of blood in my mouth. He let me go, and I turned to run away. I screamed as I felt the other man grab me by my hair and began to cry. My hands wrapped around the hand tangled in my hair as the man I bit slapped me across the face.</p><p>I continued to struggle as I was dragged towards the car, tears streaming down my face. The man pulling my hair opened the car door and tried to pull me down into the car with him but I braced my self against the door frame as he tugged on my hair.</p><p>\u201cGrab her legs,\u201d he said, and I began to kick at him as he tried to grab my ankles. The grip on my hair tightened and I shouted in pain as my head was yanked back against the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStop- hgugh! struggling you stupid-mph- brat.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden there was a loud <i>thwip</i>, and the car door slammed on the man\u2019s hand. There was a sticky sheet of what looked like stringy plastic wrap holding his hand to the door. He screamed and immediately let go of my hair, and the man that had been trying to grab my ankles stood up just before the same stringy substance wrapped around him and slammed him against the car. His knees buckled but he was stuck to the car from whatever that stuff was. </p><p>Stumbling backwards, I tripped over my attacker\u2019s shoe and felt strong arms stop me from falling and immediately began to fight against them.</p><p>\u201cHey-ouch- stop! I-ow! Just-mph\u201d I turned and took a few clumsy steps backwards. I was standing in front of Spiderman. \u201cIt\u2019s okay! I\u2019m not gonna hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I felt my shoulders relax, only to jump away from the car as the driver opened the door. It slammed shut as Spiderman shot a string at him from his hand. </p><p>\u201cJust a sec,\u201d I heard him say as he leapt up on to the car and began to shoot that stuff around the car, making sure the doors wouldn\u2019t open again. He jumped off the car And landed right in front of me. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asked. His voice sounded\u2026 familiar. I tilted my head trying to place his voice. He couldn\u2019t have been much older than me. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I said, glancing back at the car. I felt a lump in my throat and took a deep, shaky breath. \u201cAs okay as someone can be after almost being abducted.\u201d </p><p>He turned to look down the street and looked back at me.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, holding his hand out. \u201cLet me take you home.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at his hand, and nervously bit my lip. I looked back up at him and he nodded. I tentatively placed my hand in his, and he pulled me into his chest. </p><p>\u201cHang on to me,\u201d he said and I wrapped my arms around his neck, blushing as he wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me against him. </p><p>He lifted his arm and before I knew it we were soaring into the air. I gasped loudly and his grip tightened as he held me against him. I pressed my face into the crook of his neck, clinging to him for dear life.</p><p>\u201cCan I get some directions?\u201d he asked into my ear. </p><p>\u201cOh-uh- yeah,\u201d I said, turning my head as he carefully shifted me so I could see where we were going. I began to direct him and we flew through the streets, and every so often I\u2019d feel his grip tighten around my waist. After about 5 minutes, I could see my apartment building. </p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d I said nodding towards the brick building. \u201cThe front door is on the other side of the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take you straight to your room if you want,\u201d he said as we got closer. \u201cIf you\u2019ve missed curfew or something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe front door is fine,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t stop trying to place his voice, I\u2019d heard that voice from somewhere before. </p><p>He nodded and swung us around the building and into an alley across the street. My feet touched the ground and I felt his other hand on my waist, stabilizing me as I stumbled a little. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said sheepishly as I let go of him and took a few steps away from him.</p><p>\u201cWell, you were a long way from home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t gonna let-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not for the lift,\u201d I said, trying to decide what to tell my parents. \u201cThose guys-I don\u2019t know what I\u2026\u201d</p><p>I trailed off and looked at the ground as I felt tears building in the corners of my eyes. I saw him moving in my peripherals and flinched when I felt his hand on my shoulder. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I looked up at the man in the mask. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now. You\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at the apartments and Spiderman\u2019s hand left my shoulder. When I turned back he was half way up the building. </p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d I shouted, making him look down at me. He seemed to freeze above me and he muttered something under his breath.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah! Yeah, of course you do!\u201d he said as he climbed the rest of the way up the building.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d </p><p>I took a few steps back so I could still see him as he climbed over the roof and looked over the edge at me. The white eye pieces on his mask narrowed as if he was scrutinizing me. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman!\u201d </p><p>And then he was gone, leaving me alone in the darkened alley. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>I decided not to tell anyone what had happened. Even if I did, who was going to believe my story? I walked up the steps to Midtown High and sighed as I weaved in and out of students. </p><p><i>Same shit as always, </i>I thought to myself. I reached my locker and began to sort through what I needed for first and second period. </p><p>Someone walked up from behind me and leaned against the locker next to me. I looked over and smiled at MJ. She looked irritated, but then again, she always looks like that.</p><p>\u201cHave you done the calc study guide yet?\u201d she asked, crossing her arms. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I huffed fishing a binder out of my backpack. \u201cBut keep reminding me. If I don\u2019t get at least an A- I\u2019m going to fail the class.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be rude,\u201d she said uncrossing her arms as I shut my locker. We started down the hall. \u201cAnd a B is not failing.\u201d</p><p>At the end of the hall I caught sight of Ned and Peter and immediately felt my stomach to a flip. </p><p>MJ noticed. </p><p>\u201cMaybe Peter can help,\u201d she said elbowing me in the ribs. </p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I said elbowing her back. </p><p>\u201cHey, just a suggestion,\u201d she said as I opened the door to our biology classroom. \u201cIf you\u2019re dead set on that A- and I know you are- it might be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMJ,\u201d I said seriously. \u201cDrop it.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged at me and we sat next to each other on the same lab bench. We quipped back and forth while more students took their seats. Peter and Ned sat across from us and I caught Peter\u2019s eye as he pulled out the chair in front of MJ. He smiled at me as he sat down. I smiled and quickly looked away to hide my pink cheeks. </p><p>As class started I immediately lost focus and rested my chin in the palm of my hand. As much as I loved the idea of Peter tutoring me, I knew I\u2019d never be able to focus. I glanced over at him as he copied notes from the board. His curly brown hair covering his eyes as he leaned over his notebook. Every now and then he\u2019d look up and rest his chin in the palm of his hand and I could briefly see the light hit his brown eyes. </p><p>My butt vibrated, pulling me back to the classroom. I glanced up to check that our teacher wasn\u2019t looking and pulled my phone out of my back pocket. It was a text from MJ. </p><p>MJ: ur eyes glaze over when ur day dreaming</p><p>I looked over to see her discretely holding her notebook so I could clearly see what she\u2019d drawn. It was a cartoon version of me with hearts for eyes and drool dripping from my mouth. I texted back the middle finger emoji and put my phone in my backpack, signaling to MJ that I was done talking about Peter\u2026 for now. </p><p>I continued to day dream and vaguely heard our teacher wrapping up his lecture and going over the specifics for the project. </p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s due a week from today, so next Wednesday,\u201d he said, reaching for a sheet of paper on his desk. He began reading names from his list and two by two students stood up and met at the door to leave. </p><p>\u201cMichelle -Ned\u2026\u201d </p><p>Ned stood up in front of me and MJ didn\u2019t move, continuing to scroll through her phone. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)- Peter\u2026\u201d </p><p>My eyes widened and I felt my cheeks begin to get warm. I glanced at Peter and we both sheepishly smiled at each other. Out of the corner of my eye<i> </i>I could see MJ as she turned to look at me with that stupid shit eating grin on her face. She got up so quickly it was almost comical, and she made a big show about getting Ned to walk with her to \u201cdiscuss the project.\u201d </p><p>I stood up and turned to meet Peter at the end of the lab bench. We awkwardly greeted each other and began to leave class, our shoulders brushing against each other every couple steps. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been reading a couple articles,\u201d I said, as I turned down the hall towards my locker. My heart fluttered as I noted that this had been the first one-on-one conversation I\u2019d ever had with him. \u201cBut if you have something else, we can do that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really looked into anything, yet,\u201d he said, glancing up from the floor at me.

Stuffing my hands in my pockets I began the long walk home.</p><p>After a couple of blocks, I began to feel like I was being watched. I looked around and noticed a white car with tinted windows turn onto the otherwise empty street. A man got out of the back seat in front of the bodega behind me.</p><p>I turned as the car drove past me and stopped at the stop sign and I let out a sigh of relief as I felt my shoulders relax. </p><p>Suddenly, another man jumped out of the car and started to walk towards me. I heard footsteps behind me get closer and felt panic sweep over me. I turned toward the street and stepped off the side walk as I felt a hand grab my elbow. I tried to tug my arm out of his grip, but he pulled me back to the side walk as I struggled against him.</p><p>&ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo; I shouted at him, hearing the panic in my voice as I swung my free arm to punch at him. He grabbed my other wrist and I fought against him as he began to pull me toward the car as the other man continued to walk towards us. </p><p>I started to scream for help and the man I was wrestling against pulled me toward him and clamped his hand over my mouth. I bit down onto his finger and heard him yell as I felt the warm salty taste of blood in my mouth. He let me go, and I turned to run away. I screamed as I felt the other man grab me by my hair and began to cry. My hands wrapped around the hand tangled in my hair as the man I bit slapped me across the face.</p><p>I continued to struggle as I was dragged towards the car, tears streaming down my face. The man pulling my hair opened the car door and tried to pull me down into the car with him but I braced my self against the door frame as he tugged on my hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Grab her legs,&rdquo; he said, and I began to kick at him as he tried to grab my ankles. The grip on my hair tightened and I shouted in pain as my head was yanked back against the man&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Stop- hgugh! struggling you stupid-mph- brat.&rdquo;</p><p>All of a sudden there was a loud <i>thwip</i>, and the car door slammed on the man&rsquo;s hand. There was a sticky sheet of what looked like stringy plastic wrap holding his hand to the door. He screamed and immediately let go of my hair, and the man that had been trying to grab my ankles stood up just before the same stringy substance wrapped around him and slammed him against the car. His knees buckled but he was stuck to the car from whatever that stuff was. </p><p>Stumbling backwards, I tripped over my attacker&rsquo;s shoe and felt strong arms stop me from falling and immediately began to fight against them.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey-ouch- stop! I-ow! Just-mph&rdquo; I turned and took a few clumsy steps backwards. I was standing in front of Spiderman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay! I&rsquo;m not gonna hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>I felt my shoulders relax, only to jump away from the car as the driver opened the door. It slammed shut as Spiderman shot a string at him from his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Just a sec,&rdquo; I heard him say as he leapt up on to the car and began to shoot that stuff around the car, making sure the doors wouldn&rsquo;t open again. He jumped off the car And landed right in front of me. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; He asked. His voice sounded&hellip; familiar. I tilted my head trying to place his voice. He couldn&rsquo;t have been much older than me. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah,&rdquo; I said, glancing back at the car. I felt a lump in my throat and took a deep, shaky breath. &ldquo;As okay as someone can be after almost being abducted.&rdquo; </p><p>He turned to look down the street and looked back at me.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, holding his hand out. &ldquo;Let me take you home.&rdquo;</p><p>I glanced down at his hand, and nervously bit my lip. I looked back up at him and he nodded. I tentatively placed my hand in his, and he pulled me into his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Hang on to me,&rdquo; he said and I wrapped my arms around his neck, blushing as he wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me against him. </p><p>He lifted his arm and before I knew it we were soaring into the air. I gasped loudly and his grip tightened as he held me against him. I pressed my face into the crook of his neck, clinging to him for dear life.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I get some directions?&rdquo; he asked into my ear. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh-uh- yeah,&rdquo; I said, turning my head as he carefully shifted me so I could see where we were going. I began to direct him and we flew through the streets, and every so often I&rsquo;d feel his grip tighten around my waist. After about 5 minutes, I could see my apartment building. </p><p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; I said nodding towards the brick building. &ldquo;The front door is on the other side of the building.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can take you straight to your room if you want,&rdquo; he said as we got closer. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve missed curfew or something.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The front door is fine,&rdquo; I said. I couldn&rsquo;t stop trying to place his voice, I&rsquo;d heard that voice from somewhere before. </p><p>He nodded and swung us around the building and into an alley across the street. My feet touched the ground and I felt his other hand on my waist, stabilizing me as I stumbled a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said sheepishly as I let go of him and took a few steps away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you were a long way from home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I wasn&rsquo;t gonna let-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, not for the lift,&rdquo; I said, trying to decide what to tell my parents. &ldquo;Those guys-I don&rsquo;t know what I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I trailed off and looked at the ground as I felt tears building in the corners of my eyes. I saw him moving in my peripherals and flinched when I felt his hand on my shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; I looked up at the man in the mask. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe now. You&rsquo;re home.&rdquo;</p><p>I glanced over at the apartments and Spiderman&rsquo;s hand left my shoulder. When I turned back he was half way up the building. </p><p>&ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo; I shouted, making him look down at me. He seemed to freeze above me and he muttered something under his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; yeah! Yeah, of course you do!&rdquo; he said as he climbed the rest of the way up the building.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; </p><p>I took a few steps back so I could still see him as he climbed over the roof and looked over the edge at me. The white eye pieces on his mask narrowed as if he was scrutinizing me. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman!&rdquo; </p><p>And then he was gone, leaving me alone in the darkened alley. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>I decided not to tell anyone what had happened. Even if I did, who was going to believe my story? I walked up the steps to Midtown High and sighed as I weaved in and out of students. </p><p><i>Same shit as always, </i>I thought to myself. I reached my locker and began to sort through what I needed for first and second period. </p><p>Someone walked up from behind me and leaned against the locker next to me. I looked over and smiled at MJ. She looked irritated, but then again, she always looks like that.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you done the calc study guide yet?&rdquo; she asked, crossing her arms. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I huffed fishing a binder out of my backpack. &ldquo;But keep reminding me. If I don&rsquo;t get at least an A- I&rsquo;m going to fail the class.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be rude,&rdquo; she said uncrossing her arms as I shut my locker. We started down the hall. &ldquo;And a B is not failing.&rdquo;</p><p>At the end of the hall I caught sight of Ned and Peter and immediately felt my stomach to a flip. </p><p>MJ noticed. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe Peter can help,&rdquo; she said elbowing me in the ribs. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off,&rdquo; I said elbowing her back. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, just a suggestion,&rdquo; she said as I opened the door to our biology classroom. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re dead set on that A- and I know you are- it might be a good idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;MJ,&rdquo; I said seriously. &ldquo;Drop it.&rdquo;</p><p>She shrugged at me and we sat next to each other on the same lab bench. We quipped back and forth while more students took their seats. Peter and Ned sat across from us and I caught Peter&rsquo;s eye as he pulled out the chair in front of MJ. He smiled at me as he sat down. I smiled and quickly looked away to hide my pink cheeks. </p><p>As class started I immediately lost focus and rested my chin in the palm of my hand. As much as I loved the idea of Peter tutoring me, I knew I&rsquo;d never be able to focus. I glanced over at him as he copied notes from the board. His curly brown hair covering his eyes as he leaned over his notebook. Every now and then he&rsquo;d look up and rest his chin in the palm of his hand and I could briefly see the light hit his brown eyes. </p><p>My butt vibrated, pulling me back to the classroom. I glanced up to check that our teacher wasn&rsquo;t looking and pulled my phone out of my back pocket. It was a text from MJ. </p><p>MJ: ur eyes glaze over when ur day dreaming</p><p>I looked over to see her discretely holding her notebook so I could clearly see what she&rsquo;d drawn. It was a cartoon version of me with hearts for eyes and drool dripping from my mouth. I texted back the middle finger emoji and put my phone in my backpack, signaling to MJ that I was done talking about Peter&hellip; for now. </p><p>I continued to day dream and vaguely heard our teacher wrapping up his lecture and going over the specifics for the project. </p><p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s due a week from today, so next Wednesday,&rdquo; he said, reaching for a sheet of paper on his desk. He began reading names from his list and two by two students stood up and met at the door to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Michelle -Ned&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Ned stood up in front of me and MJ didn&rsquo;t move, continuing to scroll through her phone. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)- Peter&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>My eyes widened and I felt my cheeks begin to get warm. I glanced at Peter and we both sheepishly smiled at each other. Out of the corner of my eye<i> </i>I could see MJ as she turned to look at me with that stupid shit eating grin on her face. She got up so quickly it was almost comical, and she made a big show about getting Ned to walk with her to &ldquo;discuss the project.&rdquo; </p><p>I stood up and turned to meet Peter at the end of the lab bench. We awkwardly greeted each other and began to leave class, our shoulders brushing against each other every couple steps. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already been reading a couple articles,&rdquo; I said, as I turned down the hall towards my locker. My heart fluttered as I noted that this had been the first one-on-one conversation I&rsquo;d ever had with him. &ldquo;But if you have something else, we can do that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t really looked into anything, yet,&rdquo; he said, glancing up from the floor at me. When his eyes met mine I felt my cheeks getting warm again and quickly looked away. </p><p>&ldquo;We can talk about it more after school,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &rdquo;Do you want to work on it at my place or your place- unless you&rsquo;re not comfortable with- we can meet in a more public-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can go to your place, if you want?&rdquo; I said uncertainly. &ldquo;My parents are super nosy and we&rsquo;d never get anything done..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll meet up after school?&rdquo; he asked, pulling out his phone. He seemed nervous but he was also smiling, so I couldn&rsquo;t tell what he was thinking. &ldquo;Do I already have your number?&rdquo;</p><p>I shook my head and we exchanged numbers as we rounded the corner. I looked up and saw MJ and Ned standing at my locker whispering to each other. As soon as we were within ear shot the stopped talking and there was an awkward silence as we all stared at each other. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Ned blurted nervously. MJ rolled her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Smooth, Ned. Smooth,&rdquo; she said. He looked a little embarrassed and quickly changed the subject. </p><p>&ldquo;Are we gonna start the new lego set I got after school today?&rdquo; Ned asked Peter. &ldquo;I finally got the Millennium Falcon.&rdquo;</p><p>I opened my locker and saw Peter scratching the back of his neck out of the corner of my eye. </p><p>&ldquo;Actually, (Y/N) and I are gonna start working on our project after school,&rdquo; Peter said. </p><p>I shut my locker and turned around as Ned was about to start complaining but MJ cut in. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you can help (Y/N) with her calc study guide,&rdquo; she said. I glared at her as Peter turned to look at her. &ldquo;The test is Friday and she won&rsquo;t shut up about how she&rsquo;s gonna fail.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If you want I can help you with the study guide today, and we can start on the project today and finish it over the weekend,&rdquo; he said, looking back at me. I glanced at MJ behind Peter&rsquo;s back and she gave me a subtle thumbs up. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; sure,&rdquo; I said tucking a stray hair behind my ear. My cheeks felt like they were burning as he smiled back at me. &ldquo;I mean, you don&rsquo;t mind do you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding?&rdquo; Ned said. &ldquo;Pet-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s no trouble,&rdquo; Peter said quickly, glancing at Ned. &ldquo;We have to get going- to, uh, class.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned looked confused, but didn&rsquo;t respond and began to follow Peter. I watched them leave and turned back to MJ who was grinning back down at me. </p><p>&ldquo;Not a single word,&rdquo; I said as I turned away from my locker and she followed me off to second period, cackling. </p></p>",

        "body": "<p>A little bit of Morgan Stark angst. Around 1k words. Spoilers for Endgame ahead!!\u00a0</p><hr><p><b></b></p><p>Sometimes, Morgan gets mad. Really mad. She\u2019s a smart girl, and the worst part is that she knows she is. But no matter what a genius she might be, emotional maturity is something she can only gain with age. </p><p>Morgan is sixteen, and she\u2019s pissed. </p><p>Mom is away. She had an emergency company trip to Asia, somewhere in Japan. Morgan doesn\u2019t actually care. This happens a lot. Mom is old now, but she has always been a workaholic. She used to say Dad was like that, he was way worse. She doesn\u2019t talk about dad very much anymore. </p><p>It\u2019s been like that for years. Like he\u2019s fading away. </p><p>Morgan wishes she could remember him. She has some memories, but they\u2019re vage. Those kinds of very early memories she\u2019s not really sure if they\u2019re real, a dream, a reconstruction of stories she\u2019s heard from other people, or a combination of all three. It\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t know how he looks like: in the decade that has passed since his death, Tony Stark\u2019s image has become almost like a pagan saint. Everywhere she goes, somewhere, there\u2019s something of him. A sticker on a school binder, someone with an Iron Man phone case, the new biopic that\u2019s coming out with that stupid actor who harassed Mom for like a month&hellip;</p><p>The giant Iron Man mural in the park a few blocks away from her school. And Morgan hates it. </p><p>It\u2019s so corny. People even leave flowers and candles sometimes. She once saw one of her classmates praying to the image of her deceased father for a good grade on his algebra test. Some inexplicable rage had taken over her body that day, and she had then proceeded to \u201caccidentally\u201d make the boy\u2019s backpack explode. He hadn\u2019t been wearing it, and Morgan explained that she didn\u2019t want to physically harm him, no matter how much Mom had screamed. </p><p>But that day, it\u2019s dark. It\u2019s going to rain. She\u2019s carrying spray paint, because Miles had asked her to drop by the store close to her school and get him that new shade of red he was dying to try. </p><p>And Morgan is pissed. </p><!-- more --><p>But she\u2019s also an idiot. At least when it comes to her emotional processing anyway. So when the cops catch her drawing obscenities over the stupid mural, she doesn\u2019t have any better idea than to run. And she gets caught, easily. Because she can\u2019t run fast, or jump buildings, or climb walls, or fly. She isn\u2019t special like that. Sometimes she feels like she isn\u2019t special at all. </p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d asks the police woman sitting by the desk. Morgan fidgets with her handcuffs, her eyes glued to the ground. </p><p>\u201cSixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d </p><p>She can\u2019t really answer that, can she? The lake house had stopped being a home years ago. The apartment in Manhattan is almost always empty. The mansion in California is her favourite place, but is not a home. </p><p>\u201cQueens,\u201d she lies. The policewoman keeps writing down everything in her computer. She seems pissed. </p><p>Another policeman walks by the desk and stopps to read the computer screen. He makes a strange face and then turns to Morgan. </p><p>\u201cVandalizing an Iron Man memorial? What the hell\u2019s your problem, kid?\u201d </p><p>Morgan feels her cheeks turn red and her neck heat up. She would snap back at him if it wouldn\u2019t make her situation way worse. </p><p>The policewoman doesn\u2019t even blink. \u201cRead her name, Carl.\u201d </p><p>The guy, Carl, opens his eyes like plates once he reads her name on the computer. He looks confused, then laughs. </p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we all get pissed at our folks from time to time,\u201d he says, and then walks away laughing. </p><p>Morgan feels mortified. The police woman keeps taking her information and remains indifferent. </p><p>\u201cI need the phone number of your mother, a tutor, or responsible adult that can come to pick you up. Then I\u2019ll discuss with them the terms of your penalizing.\u201d </p><p>Calling Mom is impossible, she\u2019s on the other side of the globe. Happy would come, but she would sell her out to mom. Same with Uncle Rhodey. She had no other option. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do now?\u201d asks Peter\u2019s very tired voice from behind her. Morgan raises her head to meet him as he enters the police station. He looks exhausted, and Morgan feels awful for dragging him all the way across the city for this. </p><p>\u201cYou must be Mr. Parker,\u201d greets him the policewoman, and proceeds to explain to him the situation. As the seconds pass, Morgan can feel Peter\u2019s increasing glare into her neck, but she remains with her eyes to the ground. </p><p>After deciding that paying a penalty fee should be enough punishment, they let them go. She\u2019s relieved, the fee is about ten grand, and she can easily pay that from her allowance without Mom finding out. What she doesn\u2019t expect is Peter\u2019s judgmental face when she informs him.</p><p>\u201cYou know you got lucky, right?,\u201d he says, very slowly. Morgan frowns. </p><p>\u201cI got caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not because of that. You got away with it.\u201d</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t understand. \u201cI\u2019m paying a fee-\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a bitter laugh. \u201cYeah, pocket money for you. You got away with a pat in the back. How do you think this situation would\u2019ve ended up if Miles had gotten caught doing what you were doing?\u201d</p><p>Morgan stares at him. \u201cHe wouldn&rsquo;t have been caught, because he\u2019s spiderman. He can run from the police.\u201d </p><p>Now, Peter is definitely mad. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also not a white rich brat.\u201d </p><p>He has a good point, but Morgan won\u2019t allow him to berate her. \u201cWhy are you so mad? It\u2019s just a graffiti.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t answer for a few seconds. It almost looks like he won\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any mural that you destroyed, Mo. It was an Iron Man Memorial. I honestly can\u2019t understand how incredibly disrespectful-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care so much?\u201d interrupts him Morgan, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t your father.\u201d </p><p>An ugly silence settles between them. For some reason, Morgan feels like crying. She doesn&rsquo;t let any tears betray her, and keeps looking at Peter, challenging. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t look mad anymore, just sad. He can\u2019t meet her eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says after a long minute. \u201cNo he wasn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>Morgan crosses her arms in her chest, not feeling the gratification of the win at all. </p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Peter sighs. \u201cBut he was yours. You should have more respect for that.\u201d </p><p>They don\u2019t say much else after that. Peter walks her to her apartment, talks to Happy and MJ over the phone, orders a pizza, and stays the night with her. Morgan just wants him gone. She just wants to be alone. </p><p>When Peter wakes her up the next morning with breakfast and her lunch ready for school, she asks for forgiveness. There\u2019s nothing to forgive, Mo, he says, but it feels empty. When he leaves for work and leaves her alone in her huge apartment that she occasionally shares with her mother and an ever present ghost, only then she allows herself to cry. </p>",

He looks confused, then laughs. </p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we all get pissed at our folks from time to time,\u201d he says, and then walks away laughing. </p><p>Morgan feels mortified. The police woman keeps taking her information and remains indifferent. </p><p>\u201cI need the phone number of your mother, a tutor, or responsible adult that can come to pick you up. Then I\u2019ll discuss with them the terms of your penalizing.\u201d </p><p>Calling Mom is impossible, she\u2019s on the other side of the globe. Happy would come, but she would sell her out to mom. Same with Uncle Rhodey. She had no other option. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do now?\u201d asks Peter\u2019s very tired voice from behind her. Morgan raises her head to meet him as he enters the police station. He looks exhausted, and Morgan feels awful for dragging him all the way across the city for this. </p><p>\u201cYou must be Mr. Parker,\u201d greets him the policewoman, and proceeds to explain to him the situation. As the seconds pass, Morgan can feel Peter\u2019s increasing glare into her neck, but she remains with her eyes to the ground. </p><p>After deciding that paying a penalty fee should be enough punishment, they let them go. She\u2019s relieved, the fee is about ten grand, and she can easily pay that from her allowance without Mom finding out.

You got away with a pat in the back. How do you think this situation would\u2019ve ended up if Miles had gotten caught doing what you were doing?\u201d</p><p>Morgan stares at him. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have been caught, because he\u2019s spiderman. He can run from the police.\u201d </p><p>Now, Peter is definitely mad. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also not a white rich brat.\u201d </p><p>He has a good point, but Morgan won\u2019t allow him to berate her. \u201cWhy are you so mad? It\u2019s just a graffiti.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t answer for a few seconds. It almost looks like he won\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any mural that you destroyed, Mo. It was an Iron Man Memorial. I honestly can\u2019t understand how incredibly disrespectful-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care so much?\u201d interrupts him Morgan, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t your father.\u201d </p><p>An ugly silence settles between them. For some reason, Morgan feels like crying. She doesn\u2019t let any tears betray her, and keeps looking at Peter, challenging. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t look mad anymore, just sad. He can\u2019t meet her eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says after a long minute. \u201cNo he wasn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>Morgan crosses her arms in her chest, not feeling the gratification of the win at all. </p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Peter sighs. \u201cBut he was yours. You should have more respect for that.\u201d </p><p>They don\u2019t say much else after that. Peter walks her to her apartment, talks to Happy and MJ over the phone, orders a pizza, and stays the night with her. Morgan just wants him gone. She just wants to be alone. </p><p>When Peter wakes her up the next morning with breakfast and her lunch ready for school, she asks for forgiveness. There\u2019s nothing to forgive, Mo, he says, but it feels empty. When he leaves for work and leaves her alone in her huge apartment that she occasionally shares with her mother and an ever present ghost, only then she allows herself to cry. </p>",

He can&rsquo;t meet her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says after a long minute. &ldquo;No he wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>Morgan crosses her arms in her chest, not feeling the gratification of the win at all. </p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sighs. &ldquo;But he was yours. You should have more respect for that.&rdquo; </p><p>They don&rsquo;t say much else after that. Peter walks her to her apartment, talks to Happy and MJ over the phone, orders a pizza, and stays the night with her. Morgan just wants him gone. She just wants to be alone. </p><p>When Peter wakes her up the next morning with breakfast and her lunch ready for school, she asks for forgiveness. There&rsquo;s nothing to forgive, Mo, he says, but it feels empty. When he leaves for work and leaves her alone in her huge apartment that she occasionally shares with her mother and an ever present ghost, only then she allows herself to cry. </p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>A little bit of Morgan Stark angst. Around 1k words. Spoilers for Endgame ahead!!&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b></b></p>\n<p>Sometimes, Morgan gets mad. Really mad. She&rsquo;s a smart girl, and the worst part is that she knows she is. But no matter what a genius she might be, emotional maturity is something she can only gain with age. </p>\n<p>Morgan is sixteen, and she&rsquo;s pissed. </p>\n<p>Mom is away. She had an emergency company trip to Asia, somewhere in Japan. Morgan doesn&rsquo;t actually care. This happens a lot. Mom is old now, but she has always been a workaholic. She used to say Dad was like that, he was way worse. She doesn&rsquo;t talk about dad very much anymore. </p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been like that for years. Like he&rsquo;s fading away. </p>\n<p>Morgan wishes she could remember him. She has some memories, but they&rsquo;re vage. Those kinds of very early memories she&rsquo;s not really sure if they&rsquo;re real, a dream, a reconstruction of stories she&rsquo;s heard from other people, or a combination of all three. It&rsquo;s not like she doesn&rsquo;t know how he looks like: in the decade that has passed since his death, Tony Stark&rsquo;s image has become almost like a pagan saint. Everywhere she goes, somewhere, there&rsquo;s something of him. A sticker on a school binder, someone with an Iron Man phone case, the new biopic that&rsquo;s coming out with that stupid actor who harassed Mom for like a month&hellip;</p>\n<p>The giant Iron Man mural in the park a few blocks away from her school. And Morgan hates it. </p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s so corny. People even leave flowers and candles sometimes. She once saw one of her classmates praying to the image of her deceased father for a good grade on his algebra test. Some inexplicable rage had taken over her body that day, and she had then proceeded to &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; make the boy&rsquo;s backpack explode. He hadn&rsquo;t been wearing it, and Morgan explained that she didn&rsquo;t want to physically harm him, no matter how much Mom had screamed. </p>\n<p>But that day, it&rsquo;s dark. It&rsquo;s going to rain. She&rsquo;s carrying spray paint, because Miles had asked her to drop by the store close to her school and get him that new shade of red he was dying to try. </p>\n<p>And Morgan is pissed. </p>\n</p>",
