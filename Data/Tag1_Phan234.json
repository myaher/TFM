        "question": "this is a thought that has been stuck in my head for a while and i need to share it... don\u2019t you feel like in their old videos there were lots of jumpcuts and now there aren\u2019t as many? it keeps me thinking how much they do actively and purposefully leave in the videos to make people theorize about those things that they left and how much it\u2019s just them being more open to us. it\u2019s hard to read. what do you think?",
        "answer": "<p>I\u2019m gonna be 100% honest with you here, I never even notice jumpcuts. Ever. After every single video there will be a thousand posts about \u201csuspicious jumpcuts\u201d and I have to specifically go back and watch for them in order to notice them at all. The only time a jump cut will stick out to me, is if it\u2019s <i>very</i> weirdly placed. (Like the jump cut just before Phil says fuck in gtpwtw) </p><p><br/></p><p>Though, I think the difference in number of jumpcuts per video probably has a little bit to do with how comfortable they are, and a little to do with how editing styles have changed over the years. </p><p><br/></p><p>Obviously their level of comfort with sharing certain things and making certain jokes has shifted and changed over the years. I feel like 2012-2015 was the era of \u201cedit that out, they\u2019ll just use it as phan proof\u201d. And since then, they seem to care less and less about how we interpret certain things. They seem to have more of a \u201clet them think what they want to think\u201d attitude these days. </p><p><br/></p><p>But part of it is also just the way videos are edited and presented now. Lots of jump cuts and transitions and obvious editing was more in style a few years ago, and now people tend to go more \u201cseamless\u201d. If that makes sense? </p><p><br/></p><p>So to answer your question, I think maybe it\u2019s a bit of both. I think part of it is just them being more comfortable with themselves, and their relationship (whether it\u2019s romantic or not) and not caring so much how their every word and action will be interpreted. But I do think they\u2019ll occasionally stumble upon a \u201cdemon moment\u201d while editing, and leave it in just to watch people react. Balance. </p>",

He blinks, but those cobalt eyes don\u2019t dissipate. The grinning Gengar on Phil\u2019s hat remains exactly where it is, level with Dan\u2019s eyes as Phil sinks down from his tiptoes. Dan\u2019s lips are vibrating, his breaths are shallow. As he floats down from the astral plane, the noises and sights and smells outside of Phil and his melon conditioner and caramel flavoured lips re-emerge. There\u2019s a great deal of elevated chatter from all sides of the room, which Dan slowly realises is probably about him. He hears someone laugh, then shout \u201cwoo, get it, guys\u201d. Warmth spreads through his cheeks, down his neck.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dan says; his voice is a husk of itself. He feels as if someone slipped something stronger than caffeine into the espresso he chucked down a while ago. \u201cI should get back to work. My shift doesn\u2019t end for another hour.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s face falls. He\u2019s looking at Dan like he\u2019s worried he\u2019s about to break into pieces. \u201cOh, okay.\u201d He shifts from foot to foot. \u201cWill you come over after? I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He glances around, room spinning into a blur of muted colours and half-familiar faces. It seems most of the coffee shop is watching them, their caffeinated blood and elevated heart rates pushing excitable, gossip-hungry expressions onto their faces. Dan takes a step backwards. The floor feels spongy beneath his feet. The air is viscous; breathing it is like swallowing lungfuls of warm water. Just as he\u2019s starting to turn from Phil, to walk back towards the counter, back to something that makes sense, something solid and sure, Phil grabs his wrist. Dan can do nothing except stare at the spot where Phil\u2019s skin meets his, utterly dazed.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d Phil asks, panicked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I just went straight in there, that was probably really stupid. I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to catch up with my feelings.\u201d He frowns, shaking his head. \u201cOr something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dan swallows. Phil\u2019s fingers are tightly locked around his wrist, but it isn\u2019t painful. It\u2019s quite grounding. He lifts his eyes to meet Phil\u2019s, heart speeding up. \u201cThis is a lot to process. Let\u2019s talk after\u2026\u201d Dan flaps his hand to the general vicinity of the caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Phil agrees. Neither of them move, too caught up in their unbroken stare. Tentatively, Phil\u2019s thumb sweeps back and forth over the back of Dan\u2019s hand. It\u2019s been sore ever since he punched Hardy. It\u2019s a sweet, simple gesture, one that melts Dan\u2019s heart. He feels a slow, cautious smile creeping up. Before it can fully form, Phil releases him, cheeks softly pink. He shoves his hands into his back pockets. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 go sit down then. Let me know when you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a coffee?\u201d Dan asks. He pauses, awkwardly flapping a hand in the air. \u201cOn me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Phil says, beaming. \u201cThe usual.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>As the streetlights splash warm, custard yellows over the two of them, Phil reaches out and takes Dan\u2019s hand. Dan is so startled he almost trips, but Phil\u2019s grip stabilises him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Dan asks, unable to hide the hiccup of laughter that escapes.</p><p>Phil is the picture of innocence. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShocking, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019m not the\u2026 holding hands type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll cope.\u201d Phil\u2019s fingers slip between Dan\u2019s, tightening considerably.</p><p>Dan thinks about protesting further, but considering it would more than likely be pointless, he doesn\u2019t bother. This whole night has been so surreal, he can cope with this one further peculiarity. As they continue walking, Dan\u2019s fingers start to curl around Phil\u2019s of their own accord. He\u2019s never held anyone\u2019s hand before in this way; he never imagined it would feel this natural. Dan had been under the impression that couples only did the cutesy stuff to rub their romance in everyone\u2019s faces, the way an Instagram model posts photos of a brunch they won\u2019t be eating. Perhaps there&rsquo;s something to this PDA-lark, after all. </p><p>The caf\u00e9 is a twenty minute walk from Phil\u2019s; with each step, Dan is painfully aware of the unnatural silence bubbled around them. Usually, Phil\u2019s chatter is constant, to the point where Dan rarely needs to interject. Now, he\u2019s quiet, just letting their joined hands swing gently to and fro. Ten minutes pass this way, and Dan can\u2019t take the slew of paranoid thoughts pounding in his mind a second longer.</p><p>\u201cI need a cigarette,\u201d he says, digging in his pocket. He finds the pack and draws it out, then pauses, looking pointedly down at Phil\u2019s hand, clasped in his. \u201cUh..\u201d</p><p>Phil is smiling, eyebrows raised, feigning ignorance. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>Dan just rolls his eyes, then nudges the pack open with his nose, using his teeth to pluck one of the Djarums out. Phil watches in amusement as he struggles to tuck the pack away, then draw out a lighter and light the end, all with one hand. He manages, just, then shoots Phil a withering look.</p><p>\u201cCome on, nerd,\u201d Dan says, smoke streaming through his lips, then tugs on Phil\u2019s hand, and they walk on.</p><p>*</p><p>When they step over Phil\u2019s threshold, Mrs Lester\u2019s foot is on the bottom stair, just heading up. She turns in surprise, a smile spreading over her tired face. Dan tries not to overthink it when Phil releases his hand at the sight of her, but without it, he feels wobbly, as if it was keeping him balanced.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello boys,\u201d Mrs Lester says. \u201cDid you have a nice-\u201d She stops, gasping, and approaches Dan, hands outstretched. \u201cOh Dan, honey! Look at you!\u201d</p><p>Her small hands cradle his face.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, remembering. \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil told me you were in a bit of a tussle,\u201d she says, tutting. Her fingers stroke lightly over the bruises. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was this bad. You must be more careful with yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her words don\u2019t irritate him, surprisingly. Despite her mumsy tone, Dan knows it\u2019s coming from a place of genuine love and concern. Something he forgets Phil\u2019s mum is all too happy to bestow upon him, no questions asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was dumb,\u201d Dan readily admits. \u201cWon\u2019t be doing it again in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>She tuts again, but removes her hands from his face, letting them fall to her sides. She turns to Phil. \u201cLook after him, won\u2019t you darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Mum.\u201d</p><p>Mrs Lester sighs, moving back towards the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m just off to bed then, loves. Are you hungry? There\u2019s some dinner left in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>Phil glances at Dan questioningly. He leans in close to whisper, \u201cwhen was the last time you ate?\u201d</p><p>Mind blanking, Dan shrugs. \u201cHonestly don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, mum,\u201d Phil calls, already headed for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs Lester,\u201d Dan says. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKath, love,\u201d she reminds him for the umpteenth time. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, of course. Night.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s hunger had transcended physical sensation until the scent of Kath\u2019s lasagne, heating up in the microwave, filled his nostrils. He eats the slice Phil hands him in seconds, leaning against one of the kitchen counters.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Dan says, licking the fork clean. \u201cYour mum\u2019s a genius.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, still chewing. \u201cYou inhaled that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I was starving,\u201d Dan says with a frown, trying to remember the last time he ate a hot meal.</p><p>He goes to the sink to wash his bowl, as he\u2019s done countless times in Phil\u2019s kitchen. Just as he\u2019s placed it on the drying rack, he turns to find Phil has crowded up behind him, so close it makes Dan jump. Again, his fingertips tingle, and his heart leaps into his throat.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil half-whispers. He brushes Dan&rsquo;s cheek, lightly, just with his fingertips. \u201cCould I\u2026\u201d</p><p>The end of the question is lost, because Dan closes the millimetres between their mouths. His mind still swims with questions, with confusion and doubt and anxiety about what this all means, but Phil is gorgeous, and he\u2019s adorably unsure. If Dan could find the courage, which seems to have entirely abandoned him, he\u2019d take Phil upstairs right now and greedily drink down this epiphany he&rsquo;s apparently had in every possible way he could. As it happens, Phil is the one to pull Dan towards the stairs. He abandons his half-eaten meal in favour of leading Dan up to his room, stopping every few seconds to kiss him again. Each press of his lips is preceded by a sweet, hesitant glance into Dan\u2019s eyes, as if to check whether it\u2019s still okay, whether Dan still wants it. His cute, completely redundant nervousness only makes him more difficult to resist. </p><p>Phil closes his bedroom door behind them, softly. Dan sits on his bed, watching as Phil draws the curtains, switches on his bedside lamp, turns off the overhead light. He sits beside Dan once he&rsquo;s run out of tasks, and winds their fingers together again. This time, Dan doesn\u2019t complain. For a few endless moments, they just sit quietly, hands joined. This moment feels climactic somehow, as if they\u2019re supposed to be in the throes of some great passionate exchange that\u2019s been building in all the years they\u2019ve known one another. But Dan, for perhaps the first time, doesn\u2019t want to do anything else just yet. He wants to sit, and make sense of what\u2019s happening, and for Phil to not let go of his hand while he sorts it all out.</p><p>He\u2019s not certain, but he thinks Phil might feel very much the same.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to watch Buffy?\u201d</p><p>Dan lets out a breathy laugh. He nods. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil does let go then, but he gives Dan\u2019s hand a squeeze, as if to say it won\u2019t be forever. He gets out some pyjamas for them both, then switches on his TV, pretending to be busy sorting out the settings and wires while Dan gets changed. It takes a lot of willpower not to stare as Phil strips off right in front of him, in light of all that\u2019s happened this evening, but Dan can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s not quite the time. Phil joins him on the bed, and they turn their attention to the episode beginning, though Dan is quite sure that neither of them are able to focus on a single word. It\u2019s so strange, to do something so familiar, something he\u2019s done with Phil just like this, hundreds of times, and for it to feel totally alien. The negative part of Dan\u2019s brain whispers cruel things to him. </p><p>Now that you\u2019ve crossed the line of friendship, you can never go back.</p><p>He squashes the thought down as best he can, but it doesn\u2019t entirely fade. A minute or so passes, and Phil finds his hand again. It\u2019s soothing, and sweet, so Dan squeezes hard. Phil turns, concerned, and lifts his arm, places it around Dan\u2019s shoulders, pulling him close.</p><p>*</p><p>As soon as Phil opens his eyes, he knows he is alone. The thought panics him instantly, and he sits bolt upright, not even noticing that his bedroom is still shrouded in darkness, or that his window is cracked open, letting a chill in. He blinks, reaching blindly for his glasses. His stomach lurches, and he curses at himself internally for being so impulsive, for acting so rashly, for scaring Dan off by unloading too much, too quickly. He\u2019s already projecting to where he will start looking for Dan \u2013 his house, Ozone, the caf\u00e9 \u2013 when a movement catches his eye. There\u2019s a small orange glow in the corner by the window. Phil sucks in a breath, the unmistakeable scent of smoky cherry dancing in the frigid air. He freezes, then switches on his bedside light.</p><p>The soft, dim light is just enough to illuminate the shape of Dan, sat on the window ledge, smoking out of the open window. It takes a moment for Phil\u2019s eyes to adjust to the sight of him. He\u2019s wearing Phil\u2019s black t-shirt, which is covered in tiny white ghosts. He\u2019s so skinny at the moment that it hangs off him; he looks ethereal himself, like he\u2019s only half here.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil says, quietly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Dan turns at the sound of his voice. His expression is haunted. His fingers play with the pearl in his ear. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Phil sits up properly, bleary from exhaustion. His stomach is knotted with nerves. \u201cCome back to bed, I\u2019ll stay up and chat with you for a while.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes a long drag on his cigarette, then stubs it out, chucking the butt out of the window. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking\u2026\u201d Dan starts to say. Phil waits for him to complete the sentence, but he seems to think better of it.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Phil urges. \u201cPlease. Is it too much? Did I overwhelm you?\u201d</p><p>Dan swings his legs round, placing his feet on the desk beneath the ledge. He sits there, hands underneath his thighs, deliberating. \u201cThat painting you did. Of Amanda. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d He pauses, eyes trained on Phil\u2019s carpet. \u201cIt took you so long. All that time and energy. I just don\u2019t understand why you would do it if\u2026 if you didn\u2019t actually feel that way about her.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, voice fluttery with nerves. \u201cI get why you\u2019d think that.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes are distant when he lifts them. \u201cYou told me, at the caf\u00e9, that you were just\u2026 projecting your feelings for me onto her, right?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a lump in Dan\u2019s throat, strangling his words, though he\u2019s trying his best to hide it. </p><p>Phil nods again. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if that\u2019s true,\u201d Dan shakes his head. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be me you\u2019d painted sky high on a big canvas? It just doesn\u2019t make sense-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Phil interrupts.</p><p>He\u2019s already throwing the covers off himself, feet landing on the soft carpet. He goes to his desk, plucks a sketchbook at random from the dozens stacked about. He hands it to Dan, who takes it wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look inside,\u201d Phil tells him.</p><p>He crosses back to sink onto the bed, waiting. He&rsquo;s bone-tired, still - it must be 3am, or thereabouts - but he can feel the importance of this. Dan opens the sketchbook cautiously, clearly puzzled. As he takes in what\u2019s inside, his expression melts into surprise, then awe. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches. He can feel his cheeks pinkening as Dan turns page after page, but it\u2019s worth it.</p><p>\u201cHow- when did you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI painted one picture of Amanda, and honestly I hated every second,\u201d Phil says, sincerely. \u201cI was trying to get it so perfect, because I felt like it needed to be this\u2026 accurate portrait of her, y\u2019know? I don\u2019t paint like that normally. Usually I find something, or someone, to inspire me, and I just let myself run with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many,\u201d Dan breathes, wide-eyed.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t help laughing then. When Dan shoots him a questioning look, he only laughs harder. \u201cCheck one of the others. There\u2019s a few stacked on the desk there. Some in the drawers. I\u2019ve got some more in my bag. Couple in the studio, too.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Dan is still. Then, he leans down to pluck another sketchbook from a pile on the desk. He opens it at a random page, balks at the contents, then promptly closes it again. He leans down for a second time, grabbing three more sketchbooks. He looks in each one, flicking through the worn pages like it\u2019s a flipbook.</p><p>As he watches Dan, Phil starts to grow uneasy. It occurs to him that perhaps this seems a tad obsessive. Then Dan drops the books to the desk, the sound of them hitting the wood with a thud. He grips the ledge for a second, knuckles white, staring down at the ground. Phil\u2019s breathing quickens, suddenly nervous of Dan\u2019s reaction. Dan clambers down from the ledge one careful foot at a time, crouching on the desk, then sliding to the floor. He crosses the room to Phil, still sat on the bed, and stands before him. His fingers are shaking, Phil notices.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u2026 what- why would you\u2026\u201d he trails off.</p><p>Phil swallows, not sure how to explain without weirding Dan out more. \u201cYou\u2019re my muse, Dan. I squeezed out one painting of Amanda that I don\u2019t even like. One that doesn\u2019t represent me at all. I can\u2019t even count the times I\u2019ve drawn you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips disappear as he presses them together. \u201cThe way you draw me. You make me look\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Phil finishes for him. \u201cBecause you are. Every time I look, I see new colours in your eyes. I see you smile in a different way. It\u2019s so inspiring, just watching you, just having you in front of me. I\u2019ve filled so many sketchbooks with you, but I could fill a thousand more, just trying to capture your- your&hellip;\u201d Phil flaps a hand in the air, losing the word. \u201cEssence.\u201d</p><p>Dan slides a knee onto the bed at Phil\u2019s hip, then brings his other up on the other side, seating himself in Phil\u2019s lap. Phil might have stopped breathing, but he\u2019s too shocked to check. Dan is the kind of severe, electrifying beauty that is almost frightening to behold. The sort of exotic flower you should observe from a safe distance, but never touch, lest it poison you with one prick of its thorns. To have him this close is maddening; his eyes are almost black in the low light, and filled with intensity. He radiates warmth, like a dark, burning star. He smells like sharp, sour cherry, and Phil knows he tastes even better. He wants to slide his hands up Dan\u2019s sides, under the loose ghost t-shirt. He wants to draw Dan towards him, to suck another hickey into his pale skin, to kiss the grey, angry bruises on his face.</p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers rake through Phil\u2019s hair. He leans down, pushing their lips together; Phil can feel him tremble. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he whispers in the non-existent space between their mouths.</p><p>Hesitantly, Phil lets his hands float to Dan\u2019s sides. He stays on top of the t-shirt though, for now. He wants to get this right; this moment is weighty with the importance of something new and filled with potential. With every sentence he utters to reassure Dan of his feelings, Phil beats another of the demons Dan carries on his bony shoulders back into the shadows. But even now he can feel them watching suspiciously, waiting for a sign that Phil might fuck this all up, so they can spring back to their former positions.</p><p>Phil matches that dark, unwavering gaze and doesn\u2019t let himself so much as blink. \u201cYou deserve so much more than you believe, Dan.\u201d</p><p>Dan kisses him again, and this time Phil tastes salt water, like a thin film between their lips. He winds his arms around Dan\u2019s waist, holding tightly. They kiss for what seems like hours; Dan falls forwards, pushing Phil to the bed, making it too easy to just lose themselves in the taste, the touch of each other. Phil is too afraid to do more than just stroke lightly over Dan\u2019s waist, his arms, his face. Dan too, seems to feel this is more than enough, and keeps his hands in Phil\u2019s hair, then winds them around his neck. Eventually, Phil is not sure when, but they must slow, and then stop. He drifts on the periphery of sleep, fingers trailing across warm skin, the duvet keeping the cold wind from the open window at bay.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, by the way,\u201d Dan says into the silence, though perhaps Phil is already dreaming. \u201cI don\u2019t think I said it, before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Phil replies. His smile is warm, treacly across his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not\u2026 say it very much,\u201d Dan warns him, and Phil just smiles wider. \u201cI\u2019m gonna say right off the bat that I doubt I\u2019ll be very good at&hellip; all that. But I do, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Phil is almost asleep, sure, but he\u2019s still got enough energy to tease Dan a little.</p><p>Dan swats him in the arm. \u201cFuck off, once was hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Phil prods him in the ribs. \u201cDan, what do you promise?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs. There\u2019s a silence, and Phil wonders if maybe he won\u2019t be able to summon the courage to utter it a second time, if maybe he\u2019s fallen asleep. Then, there\u2019s the light graze of cherry scented lips by his ear, and the silky warm rush of Dan\u2019s breath as he whispers: \u201cI love you, nerd.\u201d</p><p><b>(Chapter Twelve coming next Tuesday at 8pm GMT!)</b></p>",

Dan&rsquo;s lips are vibrating, his breaths are shallow. As he floats down from the astral plane, the noises and sights and smells outside of Phil and his melon conditioner and caramel flavoured lips re-emerge.

That is, until Phil starts talking about Amanda Jones.<br></i><b>Word Count:</b> WIP (Estimated 12-15 chapters) updates every Tuesday<br><b>Rating:</b> Explicit<br><b>Warnings:</b> Smoking, swearing, heavy drinking, drug mentions, implied prostitution, broken home, class divide/classism, pining, light homophobia, sex <br><br></p><p><b>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/177738852529/some-kind-of-folliful-new-fic\">Chapter One</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/177982263491/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Two</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178227297225/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Three</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178454752236/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Four</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178671704545/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Five</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178676195090/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Six</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178893484577/edgelorddan-x-obliviousbisexualphil-au-chapter\">Chapter Seven</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/179122232205/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Eight</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/179356571622/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Nine</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/179631011615/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Ten</a>]</b></p><p><b>[<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15894954%2Fchapters%2F37042212&amp;t=YWVmOTliMzc0MTkyZDFjZTFkMzVmMzM4NmFlOGJjZDJmODI1Njk5YixVNUVvdGxGag%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AA-PgA5Z7k9tbi8i-ePCy7Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffeels-forever.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F177763348310%2Fsome-kind-of-folliful-new-fic&amp;m=1\">Ao3</a>!]</b></p><p>When Dan opens his eyes, Phil is still standing in front of him. He blinks, but those cobalt eyes don\u2019t dissipate. The grinning Gengar on Phil\u2019s hat remains exactly where it is, level with Dan\u2019s eyes as Phil sinks down from his tiptoes. Dan\u2019s lips are vibrating, his breaths are shallow. As he floats down from the astral plane, the noises and sights and smells outside of Phil and his melon conditioner and caramel flavoured lips re-emerge. There\u2019s a great deal of elevated chatter from all sides of the room, which Dan slowly realises is probably about him. He hears someone laugh, then shout \u201cwoo, get it, guys\u201d. Warmth spreads through his cheeks, down his neck.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dan says; his voice is a husk of itself. He feels as if someone slipped something stronger than caffeine into the espresso he chucked down a while ago. \u201cI should get back to work. My shift doesn\u2019t end for another hour.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s face falls. He\u2019s looking at Dan like he\u2019s worried he\u2019s about to break into pieces. \u201cOh, okay.\u201d He shifts from foot to foot. \u201cWill you come over after? I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He glances around, room spinning into a blur of muted colours and half-familiar faces. It seems most of the coffee shop is watching them, their caffeinated blood and elevated heart rates pushing excitable, gossip-hungry expressions onto their faces. Dan takes a step backwards. The floor feels spongy beneath his feet. The air is viscous; breathing it is like swallowing lungfuls of warm water. Just as he\u2019s starting to turn from Phil, to walk back towards the counter, back to something that makes sense, something solid and sure, Phil grabs his wrist. Dan can do nothing except stare at the spot where Phil\u2019s skin meets his, utterly dazed.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d Phil asks, panicked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I just went straight in there, that was probably really stupid. I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to catch up with my feelings.\u201d He frowns, shaking his head. \u201cOr something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dan swallows. Phil\u2019s fingers are tightly locked around his wrist, but it isn\u2019t painful. It\u2019s quite grounding. He lifts his eyes to meet Phil\u2019s, heart speeding up. \u201cThis is a lot to process. Let\u2019s talk after\u2026\u201d Dan flaps his hand to the general vicinity of the caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Phil agrees. Neither of them move, too caught up in their unbroken stare. Tentatively, Phil\u2019s thumb sweeps back and forth over the back of Dan\u2019s hand. It\u2019s been sore ever since he punched Hardy. It\u2019s a sweet, simple gesture, one that melts Dan\u2019s heart. He feels a slow, cautious smile creeping up. Before it can fully form, Phil releases him, cheeks softly pink. He shoves his hands into his back pockets. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 go sit down then. Let me know when you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a coffee?\u201d Dan asks. He pauses, awkwardly flapping a hand in the air. \u201cOn me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Phil says, beaming. \u201cThe usual.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>As the streetlights splash warm, custard yellows over the two of them, Phil reaches out and takes Dan\u2019s hand. Dan is so startled he almost trips, but Phil\u2019s grip stabilises him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Dan asks, unable to hide the hiccup of laughter that escapes.</p><p>Phil is the picture of innocence. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShocking, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019m not the\u2026 holding hands type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll cope.\u201d Phil\u2019s fingers slip between Dan\u2019s, tightening considerably.</p><p>Dan thinks about protesting further, but considering it would more than likely be pointless, he doesn\u2019t bother. This whole night has been so surreal, he can cope with this one further peculiarity. As they continue walking, Dan\u2019s fingers start to curl around Phil\u2019s of their own accord. He\u2019s never held anyone\u2019s hand before in this way; he never imagined it would feel this natural. Dan had been under the impression that couples only did the cutesy stuff to rub their romance in everyone\u2019s faces, the way an Instagram model posts photos of a brunch they won\u2019t be eating. Perhaps there\u2019s something to this PDA-lark, after all. </p><p>The caf\u00e9 is a twenty minute walk from Phil\u2019s; with each step, Dan is painfully aware of the unnatural silence bubbled around them. Usually, Phil\u2019s chatter is constant, to the point where Dan rarely needs to interject. Now, he\u2019s quiet, just letting their joined hands swing gently to and fro. Ten minutes pass this way, and Dan can\u2019t take the slew of paranoid thoughts pounding in his mind a second longer.</p><p>\u201cI need a cigarette,\u201d he says, digging in his pocket. He finds the pack and draws it out, then pauses, looking pointedly down at Phil\u2019s hand, clasped in his. \u201cUh..\u201d</p><p>Phil is smiling, eyebrows raised, feigning ignorance. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>Dan just rolls his eyes, then nudges the pack open with his nose, using his teeth to pluck one of the Djarums out. Phil watches in amusement as he struggles to tuck the pack away, then draw out a lighter and light the end, all with one hand. He manages, just, then shoots Phil a withering look.</p><p>\u201cCome on, nerd,\u201d Dan says, smoke streaming through his lips, then tugs on Phil\u2019s hand, and they walk on.</p><p>*</p><p>When they step over Phil\u2019s threshold, Mrs Lester\u2019s foot is on the bottom stair, just heading up. She turns in surprise, a smile spreading over her tired face. Dan tries not to overthink it when Phil releases his hand at the sight of her, but without it, he feels wobbly, as if it was keeping him balanced.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello boys,\u201d Mrs Lester says. \u201cDid you have a nice-\u201d She stops, gasping, and approaches Dan, hands outstretched. \u201cOh Dan, honey! Look at you!\u201d</p><p>Her small hands cradle his face.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, remembering. \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil told me you were in a bit of a tussle,\u201d she says, tutting. Her fingers stroke lightly over the bruises. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was this bad. You must be more careful with yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her words don\u2019t irritate him, surprisingly. Despite her mumsy tone, Dan knows it\u2019s coming from a place of genuine love and concern. Something he forgets Phil\u2019s mum is all too happy to bestow upon him, no questions asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was dumb,\u201d Dan readily admits. \u201cWon\u2019t be doing it again in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>She tuts again, but removes her hands from his face, letting them fall to her sides. She turns to Phil. \u201cLook after him, won\u2019t you darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Mum.\u201d</p><p>Mrs Lester sighs, moving back towards the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m just off to bed then, loves. Are you hungry? There\u2019s some dinner left in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>Phil glances at Dan questioningly. He leans in close to whisper, \u201cwhen was the last time you ate?\u201d</p><p>Mind blanking, Dan shrugs. \u201cHonestly don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, mum,\u201d Phil calls, already headed for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs Lester,\u201d Dan says. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKath, love,\u201d she reminds him for the umpteenth time. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, of course. Night.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s hunger had transcended physical sensation until the scent of Kath\u2019s lasagne, heating up in the microwave, filled his nostrils. He eats the slice Phil hands him in seconds, leaning against one of the kitchen counters.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Dan says, licking the fork clean. \u201cYour mum\u2019s a genius.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, still chewing. \u201cYou inhaled that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I was starving,\u201d Dan says with a frown, trying to remember the last time he ate a hot meal.</p><p>He goes to the sink to wash his bowl, as he\u2019s done countless times in Phil\u2019s kitchen. Just as he\u2019s placed it on the drying rack, he turns to find Phil has crowded up behind him, so close it makes Dan jump. Again, his fingertips tingle, and his heart leaps into his throat.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil half-whispers. He brushes Dan\u2019s cheek, lightly, just with his fingertips. \u201cCould I\u2026\u201d</p><p>The end of the question is lost, because Dan closes the millimetres between their mouths. His mind still swims with questions, with confusion and doubt and anxiety about what this all means, but Phil is gorgeous, and he\u2019s adorably unsure. If Dan could find the courage, which seems to have entirely abandoned him, he\u2019d take Phil upstairs right now and greedily drink down this epiphany he\u2019s apparently had in every possible way he could. As it happens, Phil is the one to pull Dan towards the stairs. He abandons his half-eaten meal in favour of leading Dan up to his room, stopping every few seconds to kiss him again. Each press of his lips is preceded by a sweet, hesitant glance into Dan\u2019s eyes, as if to check whether it\u2019s still okay, whether Dan still wants it. His cute, completely redundant nervousness only makes him more difficult to resist. </p><p>Phil closes his bedroom door behind them, softly. Dan sits on his bed, watching as Phil draws the curtains, switches on his bedside lamp, turns off the overhead light. He sits beside Dan once he\u2019s run out of tasks, and winds their fingers together again. This time, Dan doesn\u2019t complain. For a few endless moments, they just sit quietly, hands joined. This moment feels climactic somehow, as if they\u2019re supposed to be in the throes of some great passionate exchange that\u2019s been building in all the years they\u2019ve known one another. But Dan, for perhaps the first time, doesn\u2019t want to do anything else just yet. He wants to sit, and make sense of what\u2019s happening, and for Phil to not let go of his hand while he sorts it all out.</p><p>He\u2019s not certain, but he thinks Phil might feel very much the same.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to watch Buffy?\u201d</p><p>Dan lets out a breathy laugh. He nods. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil does let go then, but he gives Dan\u2019s hand a squeeze, as if to say it won\u2019t be forever. He gets out some pyjamas for them both, then switches on his TV, pretending to be busy sorting out the settings and wires while Dan gets changed. It takes a lot of willpower not to stare as Phil strips off right in front of him, in light of all that\u2019s happened this evening, but Dan can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s not quite the time. Phil joins him on the bed, and they turn their attention to the episode beginning, though Dan is quite sure that neither of them are able to focus on a single word. It\u2019s so strange, to do something so familiar, something he\u2019s done with Phil just like this, hundreds of times, and for it to feel totally alien. The negative part of Dan\u2019s brain whispers cruel things to him. </p><p>Now that you\u2019ve crossed the line of friendship, you can never go back.</p><p>He squashes the thought down as best he can, but it doesn\u2019t entirely fade. A minute or so passes, and Phil finds his hand again. It\u2019s soothing, and sweet, so Dan squeezes hard. Phil turns, concerned, and lifts his arm, places it around Dan\u2019s shoulders, pulling him close.</p><p>*</p><p>As soon as Phil opens his eyes, he knows he is alone. The thought panics him instantly, and he sits bolt upright, not even noticing that his bedroom is still shrouded in darkness, or that his window is cracked open, letting a chill in. He blinks, reaching blindly for his glasses. His stomach lurches, and he curses at himself internally for being so impulsive, for acting so rashly, for scaring Dan off by unloading too much, too quickly. He\u2019s already projecting to where he will start looking for Dan \u2013 his house, Ozone, the caf\u00e9 \u2013 when a movement catches his eye. There\u2019s a small orange glow in the corner by the window. Phil sucks in a breath, the unmistakeable scent of smoky cherry dancing in the frigid air. He freezes, then switches on his bedside light.</p><p>The soft, dim light is just enough to illuminate the shape of Dan, sat on the window ledge, smoking out of the open window. It takes a moment for Phil\u2019s eyes to adjust to the sight of him. He\u2019s wearing Phil\u2019s black t-shirt, which is covered in tiny white ghosts. He\u2019s so skinny at the moment that it hangs off him; he looks ethereal himself, like he\u2019s only half here.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil says, quietly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Dan turns at the sound of his voice. His expression is haunted. His fingers play with the pearl in his ear. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Phil sits up properly, bleary from exhaustion. His stomach is knotted with nerves. \u201cCome back to bed, I\u2019ll stay up and chat with you for a while.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes a long drag on his cigarette, then stubs it out, chucking the butt out of the window. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking\u2026\u201d Dan starts to say. Phil waits for him to complete the sentence, but he seems to think better of it.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Phil urges. \u201cPlease. Is it too much? Did I overwhelm you?\u201d</p><p>Dan swings his legs round, placing his feet on the desk beneath the ledge. He sits there, hands underneath his thighs, deliberating. \u201cThat painting you did. Of Amanda. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d He pauses, eyes trained on Phil\u2019s carpet. \u201cIt took you so long. All that time and energy. I just don\u2019t understand why you would do it if\u2026 if you didn\u2019t actually feel that way about her.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, voice fluttery with nerves. \u201cI get why you\u2019d think that.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes are distant when he lifts them. \u201cYou told me, at the caf\u00e9, that you were just\u2026 projecting your feelings for me onto her, right?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a lump in Dan\u2019s throat, strangling his words, though he\u2019s trying his best to hide it. </p><p>Phil nods again. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if that\u2019s true,\u201d Dan shakes his head. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be me you\u2019d painted sky high on a big canvas? It just doesn\u2019t make sense-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Phil interrupts.</p><p>He\u2019s already throwing the covers off himself, feet landing on the soft carpet. He goes to his desk, plucks a sketchbook at random from the dozens stacked about. He hands it to Dan, who takes it wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look inside,\u201d Phil tells him.</p><p>He crosses back to sink onto the bed, waiting. He\u2019s bone-tired, still - it must be 3am, or thereabouts - but he can feel the importance of this. Dan opens the sketchbook cautiously, clearly puzzled. As he takes in what\u2019s inside, his expression melts into surprise, then awe. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches. He can feel his cheeks pinkening as Dan turns page after page, but it\u2019s worth it.</p><p>\u201cHow- when did you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI painted one picture of Amanda, and honestly I hated every second,\u201d Phil says, sincerely. \u201cI was trying to get it so perfect, because I felt like it needed to be this\u2026 accurate portrait of her, y\u2019know? I don\u2019t paint like that normally. Usually I find something, or someone, to inspire me, and I just let myself run with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many,\u201d Dan breathes, wide-eyed.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t help laughing then. When Dan shoots him a questioning look, he only laughs harder. \u201cCheck one of the others. There\u2019s a few stacked on the desk there. Some in the drawers. I\u2019ve got some more in my bag. Couple in the studio, too.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Dan is still. Then, he leans down to pluck another sketchbook from a pile on the desk. He opens it at a random page, balks at the contents, then promptly closes it again. He leans down for a second time, grabbing three more sketchbooks. He looks in each one, flicking through the worn pages like it\u2019s a flipbook.</p><p>As he watches Dan, Phil starts to grow uneasy. It occurs to him that perhaps this seems a tad obsessive. Then Dan drops the books to the desk, the sound of them hitting the wood with a thud. He grips the ledge for a second, knuckles white, staring down at the ground. Phil\u2019s breathing quickens, suddenly nervous of Dan\u2019s reaction. Dan clambers down from the ledge one careful foot at a time, crouching on the desk, then sliding to the floor. He crosses the room to Phil, still sat on the bed, and stands before him. His fingers are shaking, Phil notices.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u2026 what- why would you\u2026\u201d he trails off.</p><p>Phil swallows, not sure how to explain without weirding Dan out more. \u201cYou\u2019re my muse, Dan. I squeezed out one painting of Amanda that I don\u2019t even like. One that doesn\u2019t represent me at all. I can\u2019t even count the times I\u2019ve drawn you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips disappear as he presses them together. \u201cThe way you draw me. You make me look\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Phil finishes for him. \u201cBecause you are. Every time I look, I see new colours in your eyes. I see you smile in a different way. It\u2019s so inspiring, just watching you, just having you in front of me. I\u2019ve filled so many sketchbooks with you, but I could fill a thousand more, just trying to capture your- your\u2026\u201d Phil flaps a hand in the air, losing the word. \u201cEssence.\u201d</p><p>Dan slides a knee onto the bed at Phil\u2019s hip, then brings his other up on the other side, seating himself in Phil\u2019s lap. Phil might have stopped breathing, but he\u2019s too shocked to check. Dan is the kind of severe, electrifying beauty that is almost frightening to behold. The sort of exotic flower you should observe from a safe distance, but never touch, lest it poison you with one prick of its thorns. To have him this close is maddening; his eyes are almost black in the low light, and filled with intensity. He radiates warmth, like a dark, burning star. He smells like sharp, sour cherry, and Phil knows he tastes even better. He wants to slide his hands up Dan\u2019s sides, under the loose ghost t-shirt. He wants to draw Dan towards him, to suck another hickey into his pale skin, to kiss the grey, angry bruises on his face.</p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers rake through Phil\u2019s hair. He leans down, pushing their lips together; Phil can feel him tremble. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he whispers in the non-existent space between their mouths.</p><p>Hesitantly, Phil lets his hands float to Dan\u2019s sides. He stays on top of the t-shirt though, for now. He wants to get this right; this moment is weighty with the importance of something new and filled with potential. With every sentence he utters to reassure Dan of his feelings, Phil beats another of the demons Dan carries on his bony shoulders back into the shadows. But even now he can feel them watching suspiciously, waiting for a sign that Phil might fuck this all up, so they can spring back to their former positions.</p><p>Phil matches that dark, unwavering gaze and doesn\u2019t let himself so much as blink. \u201cYou deserve so much more than you believe, Dan.\u201d</p><p>Dan kisses him again, and this time Phil tastes salt water, like a thin film between their lips. He winds his arms around Dan\u2019s waist, holding tightly. They kiss for what seems like hours; Dan falls forwards, pushing Phil to the bed, making it too easy to just lose themselves in the taste, the touch of each other. Phil is too afraid to do more than just stroke lightly over Dan\u2019s waist, his arms, his face. Dan too, seems to feel this is more than enough, and keeps his hands in Phil\u2019s hair, then winds them around his neck. Eventually, Phil is not sure when, but they must slow, and then stop. He drifts on the periphery of sleep, fingers trailing across warm skin, the duvet keeping the cold wind from the open window at bay.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, by the way,\u201d Dan says into the silence, though perhaps Phil is already dreaming. \u201cI don\u2019t think I said it, before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Phil replies. His smile is warm, treacly across his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not\u2026 say it very much,\u201d Dan warns him, and Phil just smiles wider. \u201cI\u2019m gonna say right off the bat that I doubt I\u2019ll be very good at\u2026 all that. But I do, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Phil is almost asleep, sure, but he\u2019s still got enough energy to tease Dan a little.</p><p>Dan swats him in the arm. \u201cFuck off, once was hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Phil prods him in the ribs. \u201cDan, what do you promise?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs. There\u2019s a silence, and Phil wonders if maybe he won\u2019t be able to summon the courage to utter it a second time, if maybe he\u2019s fallen asleep. Then, there\u2019s the light graze of cherry scented lips by his ear, and the silky warm rush of Dan\u2019s breath as he whispers: \u201cI love you, nerd.\u201d</p><p><b>(Chapter Twelve coming next Tuesday at 8pm GMT!)</b></p>",

He blinks, but those cobalt eyes don\u2019t dissipate. The grinning Gengar on Phil\u2019s hat remains exactly where it is, level with Dan\u2019s eyes as Phil sinks down from his tiptoes. Dan\u2019s lips are vibrating, his breaths are shallow. As he floats down from the astral plane, the noises and sights and smells outside of Phil and his melon conditioner and caramel flavoured lips re-emerge. There\u2019s a great deal of elevated chatter from all sides of the room, which Dan slowly realises is probably about him. He hears someone laugh, then shout \u201cwoo, get it, guys\u201d. Warmth spreads through his cheeks, down his neck.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dan says; his voice is a husk of itself. He feels as if someone slipped something stronger than caffeine into the espresso he chucked down a while ago. \u201cI should get back to work. My shift doesn\u2019t end for another hour.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s face falls. He\u2019s looking at Dan like he\u2019s worried he\u2019s about to break into pieces. \u201cOh, okay.\u201d He shifts from foot to foot. \u201cWill you come over after? I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He glances around, room spinning into a blur of muted colours and half-familiar faces. It seems most of the coffee shop is watching them, their caffeinated blood and elevated heart rates pushing excitable, gossip-hungry expressions onto their faces. Dan takes a step backwards. The floor feels spongy beneath his feet. The air is viscous; breathing it is like swallowing lungfuls of warm water. Just as he\u2019s starting to turn from Phil, to walk back towards the counter, back to something that makes sense, something solid and sure, Phil grabs his wrist. Dan can do nothing except stare at the spot where Phil\u2019s skin meets his, utterly dazed.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d Phil asks, panicked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I just went straight in there, that was probably really stupid. I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to catch up with my feelings.\u201d He frowns, shaking his head. \u201cOr something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dan swallows. Phil\u2019s fingers are tightly locked around his wrist, but it isn\u2019t painful. It\u2019s quite grounding. He lifts his eyes to meet Phil\u2019s, heart speeding up. \u201cThis is a lot to process. Let\u2019s talk after\u2026\u201d Dan flaps his hand to the general vicinity of the caf\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Phil agrees. Neither of them move, too caught up in their unbroken stare. Tentatively, Phil\u2019s thumb sweeps back and forth over the back of Dan\u2019s hand. It\u2019s been sore ever since he punched Hardy. It\u2019s a sweet, simple gesture, one that melts Dan\u2019s heart. He feels a slow, cautious smile creeping up. Before it can fully form, Phil releases him, cheeks softly pink. He shoves his hands into his back pockets. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 go sit down then. Let me know when you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a coffee?\u201d Dan asks. He pauses, awkwardly flapping a hand in the air. \u201cOn me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Phil says, beaming. \u201cThe usual.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>As the streetlights splash warm, custard yellows over the two of them, Phil reaches out and takes Dan\u2019s hand. Dan is so startled he almost trips, but Phil\u2019s grip stabilises him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Dan asks, unable to hide the hiccup of laughter that escapes.</p><p>Phil is the picture of innocence. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShocking, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019m not the\u2026 holding hands type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll cope.\u201d Phil\u2019s fingers slip between Dan\u2019s, tightening considerably.</p><p>Dan thinks about protesting further, but considering it would more than likely be pointless, he doesn\u2019t bother. This whole night has been so surreal, he can cope with this one further peculiarity. As they continue walking, Dan\u2019s fingers start to curl around Phil\u2019s of their own accord. He\u2019s never held anyone\u2019s hand before in this way; he never imagined it would feel this natural. Dan had been under the impression that couples only did the cutesy stuff to rub their romance in everyone\u2019s faces, the way an Instagram model posts photos of a brunch they won\u2019t be eating. Perhaps there\u2019s something to this PDA-lark, after all. </p><p>The caf\u00e9 is a twenty minute walk from Phil\u2019s; with each step, Dan is painfully aware of the unnatural silence bubbled around them. Usually, Phil\u2019s chatter is constant, to the point where Dan rarely needs to interject. Now, he\u2019s quiet, just letting their joined hands swing gently to and fro. Ten minutes pass this way, and Dan can\u2019t take the slew of paranoid thoughts pounding in his mind a second longer.</p><p>\u201cI need a cigarette,\u201d he says, digging in his pocket. He finds the pack and draws it out, then pauses, looking pointedly down at Phil\u2019s hand, clasped in his. \u201cUh..\u201d</p><p>Phil is smiling, eyebrows raised, feigning ignorance. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>Dan just rolls his eyes, then nudges the pack open with his nose, using his teeth to pluck one of the Djarums out. Phil watches in amusement as he struggles to tuck the pack away, then draw out a lighter and light the end, all with one hand. He manages, just, then shoots Phil a withering look.</p><p>\u201cCome on, nerd,\u201d Dan says, smoke streaming through his lips, then tugs on Phil\u2019s hand, and they walk on.</p><p>*</p><p>When they step over Phil\u2019s threshold, Mrs Lester\u2019s foot is on the bottom stair, just heading up. She turns in surprise, a smile spreading over her tired face. Dan tries not to overthink it when Phil releases his hand at the sight of her, but without it, he feels wobbly, as if it was keeping him balanced.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello boys,\u201d Mrs Lester says. \u201cDid you have a nice-\u201d She stops, gasping, and approaches Dan, hands outstretched. \u201cOh Dan, honey! Look at you!\u201d</p><p>Her small hands cradle his face.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, remembering. \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil told me you were in a bit of a tussle,\u201d she says, tutting. Her fingers stroke lightly over the bruises. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was this bad. You must be more careful with yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her words don\u2019t irritate him, surprisingly. Despite her mumsy tone, Dan knows it\u2019s coming from a place of genuine love and concern. Something he forgets Phil\u2019s mum is all too happy to bestow upon him, no questions asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was dumb,\u201d Dan readily admits. \u201cWon\u2019t be doing it again in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>She tuts again, but removes her hands from his face, letting them fall to her sides. She turns to Phil. \u201cLook after him, won\u2019t you darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Mum.\u201d</p><p>Mrs Lester sighs, moving back towards the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m just off to bed then, loves. Are you hungry? There\u2019s some dinner left in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>Phil glances at Dan questioningly. He leans in close to whisper, \u201cwhen was the last time you ate?\u201d</p><p>Mind blanking, Dan shrugs. \u201cHonestly don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, mum,\u201d Phil calls, already headed for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs Lester,\u201d Dan says. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKath, love,\u201d she reminds him for the umpteenth time. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, of course. Night.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s hunger had transcended physical sensation until the scent of Kath\u2019s lasagne, heating up in the microwave, filled his nostrils. He eats the slice Phil hands him in seconds, leaning against one of the kitchen counters.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Dan says, licking the fork clean. \u201cYour mum\u2019s a genius.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, still chewing. \u201cYou inhaled that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I was starving,\u201d Dan says with a frown, trying to remember the last time he ate a hot meal.</p><p>He goes to the sink to wash his bowl, as he\u2019s done countless times in Phil\u2019s kitchen. Just as he\u2019s placed it on the drying rack, he turns to find Phil has crowded up behind him, so close it makes Dan jump. Again, his fingertips tingle, and his heart leaps into his throat.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil half-whispers. He brushes Dan\u2019s cheek, lightly, just with his fingertips. \u201cCould I\u2026\u201d</p><p>The end of the question is lost, because Dan closes the millimetres between their mouths. His mind still swims with questions, with confusion and doubt and anxiety about what this all means, but Phil is gorgeous, and he\u2019s adorably unsure. If Dan could find the courage, which seems to have entirely abandoned him, he\u2019d take Phil upstairs right now and greedily drink down this epiphany he\u2019s apparently had in every possible way he could. As it happens, Phil is the one to pull Dan towards the stairs. He abandons his half-eaten meal in favour of leading Dan up to his room, stopping every few seconds to kiss him again. Each press of his lips is preceded by a sweet, hesitant glance into Dan\u2019s eyes, as if to check whether it\u2019s still okay, whether Dan still wants it. His cute, completely redundant nervousness only makes him more difficult to resist. </p><p>Phil closes his bedroom door behind them, softly. Dan sits on his bed, watching as Phil draws the curtains, switches on his bedside lamp, turns off the overhead light. He sits beside Dan once he\u2019s run out of tasks, and winds their fingers together again. This time, Dan doesn\u2019t complain. For a few endless moments, they just sit quietly, hands joined. This moment feels climactic somehow, as if they\u2019re supposed to be in the throes of some great passionate exchange that\u2019s been building in all the years they\u2019ve known one another. But Dan, for perhaps the first time, doesn\u2019t want to do anything else just yet. He wants to sit, and make sense of what\u2019s happening, and for Phil to not let go of his hand while he sorts it all out.</p><p>He\u2019s not certain, but he thinks Phil might feel very much the same.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to watch Buffy?\u201d</p><p>Dan lets out a breathy laugh. He nods. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil does let go then, but he gives Dan\u2019s hand a squeeze, as if to say it won\u2019t be forever. He gets out some pyjamas for them both, then switches on his TV, pretending to be busy sorting out the settings and wires while Dan gets changed. It takes a lot of willpower not to stare as Phil strips off right in front of him, in light of all that\u2019s happened this evening, but Dan can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s not quite the time. Phil joins him on the bed, and they turn their attention to the episode beginning, though Dan is quite sure that neither of them are able to focus on a single word. It\u2019s so strange, to do something so familiar, something he\u2019s done with Phil just like this, hundreds of times, and for it to feel totally alien. The negative part of Dan\u2019s brain whispers cruel things to him. </p><p>Now that you\u2019ve crossed the line of friendship, you can never go back.</p><p>He squashes the thought down as best he can, but it doesn\u2019t entirely fade. A minute or so passes, and Phil finds his hand again. It\u2019s soothing, and sweet, so Dan squeezes hard. Phil turns, concerned, and lifts his arm, places it around Dan\u2019s shoulders, pulling him close.</p><p>*</p><p>As soon as Phil opens his eyes, he knows he is alone. The thought panics him instantly, and he sits bolt upright, not even noticing that his bedroom is still shrouded in darkness, or that his window is cracked open, letting a chill in. He blinks, reaching blindly for his glasses. His stomach lurches, and he curses at himself internally for being so impulsive, for acting so rashly, for scaring Dan off by unloading too much, too quickly. He\u2019s already projecting to where he will start looking for Dan \u2013 his house, Ozone, the caf\u00e9 \u2013 when a movement catches his eye. There\u2019s a small orange glow in the corner by the window. Phil sucks in a breath, the unmistakeable scent of smoky cherry dancing in the frigid air. He freezes, then switches on his bedside light.</p><p>The soft, dim light is just enough to illuminate the shape of Dan, sat on the window ledge, smoking out of the open window. It takes a moment for Phil\u2019s eyes to adjust to the sight of him. He\u2019s wearing Phil\u2019s black t-shirt, which is covered in tiny white ghosts. He\u2019s so skinny at the moment that it hangs off him; he looks ethereal himself, like he\u2019s only half here.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil says, quietly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Dan turns at the sound of his voice. His expression is haunted. His fingers play with the pearl in his ear. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Phil sits up properly, bleary from exhaustion. His stomach is knotted with nerves. \u201cCome back to bed, I\u2019ll stay up and chat with you for a while.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes a long drag on his cigarette, then stubs it out, chucking the butt out of the window. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking\u2026\u201d Dan starts to say. Phil waits for him to complete the sentence, but he seems to think better of it.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Phil urges. \u201cPlease. Is it too much? Did I overwhelm you?\u201d</p><p>Dan swings his legs round, placing his feet on the desk beneath the ledge. He sits there, hands underneath his thighs, deliberating. \u201cThat painting you did. Of Amanda. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d He pauses, eyes trained on Phil\u2019s carpet. \u201cIt took you so long. All that time and energy. I just don\u2019t understand why you would do it if\u2026 if you didn\u2019t actually feel that way about her.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, voice fluttery with nerves. \u201cI get why you\u2019d think that.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes are distant when he lifts them. \u201cYou told me, at the caf\u00e9, that you were just\u2026 projecting your feelings for me onto her, right?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a lump in Dan\u2019s throat, strangling his words, though he\u2019s trying his best to hide it. </p><p>Phil nods again. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if that\u2019s true,\u201d Dan shakes his head. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be me you\u2019d painted sky high on a big canvas? It just doesn\u2019t make sense-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Phil interrupts.</p><p>He\u2019s already throwing the covers off himself, feet landing on the soft carpet. He goes to his desk, plucks a sketchbook at random from the dozens stacked about. He hands it to Dan, who takes it wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look inside,\u201d Phil tells him.</p><p>He crosses back to sink onto the bed, waiting. He\u2019s bone-tired, still - it must be 3am, or thereabouts - but he can feel the importance of this. Dan opens the sketchbook cautiously, clearly puzzled. As he takes in what\u2019s inside, his expression melts into surprise, then awe. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches. He can feel his cheeks pinkening as Dan turns page after page, but it\u2019s worth it.</p><p>\u201cHow- when did you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI painted one picture of Amanda, and honestly I hated every second,\u201d Phil says, sincerely. \u201cI was trying to get it so perfect, because I felt like it needed to be this\u2026 accurate portrait of her, y\u2019know? I don\u2019t paint like that normally. Usually I find something, or someone, to inspire me, and I just let myself run with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many,\u201d Dan breathes, wide-eyed.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t help laughing then. When Dan shoots him a questioning look, he only laughs harder. \u201cCheck one of the others. There\u2019s a few stacked on the desk there. Some in the drawers. I\u2019ve got some more in my bag. Couple in the studio, too.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Dan is still. Then, he leans down to pluck another sketchbook from a pile on the desk. He opens it at a random page, balks at the contents, then promptly closes it again. He leans down for a second time, grabbing three more sketchbooks. He looks in each one, flicking through the worn pages like it\u2019s a flipbook.</p><p>As he watches Dan, Phil starts to grow uneasy. It occurs to him that perhaps this seems a tad obsessive. Then Dan drops the books to the desk, the sound of them hitting the wood with a thud. He grips the ledge for a second, knuckles white, staring down at the ground. Phil\u2019s breathing quickens, suddenly nervous of Dan\u2019s reaction. Dan clambers down from the ledge one careful foot at a time, crouching on the desk, then sliding to the floor. He crosses the room to Phil, still sat on the bed, and stands before him. His fingers are shaking, Phil notices.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u2026 what- why would you\u2026\u201d he trails off.</p><p>Phil swallows, not sure how to explain without weirding Dan out more. \u201cYou\u2019re my muse, Dan. I squeezed out one painting of Amanda that I don\u2019t even like. One that doesn\u2019t represent me at all. I can\u2019t even count the times I\u2019ve drawn you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips disappear as he presses them together. \u201cThe way you draw me. You make me look\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Phil finishes for him. \u201cBecause you are. Every time I look, I see new colours in your eyes. I see you smile in a different way. It\u2019s so inspiring, just watching you, just having you in front of me. I\u2019ve filled so many sketchbooks with you, but I could fill a thousand more, just trying to capture your- your\u2026\u201d Phil flaps a hand in the air, losing the word. \u201cEssence.\u201d</p><p>Dan slides a knee onto the bed at Phil\u2019s hip, then brings his other up on the other side, seating himself in Phil\u2019s lap. Phil might have stopped breathing, but he\u2019s too shocked to check. Dan is the kind of severe, electrifying beauty that is almost frightening to behold. The sort of exotic flower you should observe from a safe distance, but never touch, lest it poison you with one prick of its thorns. To have him this close is maddening; his eyes are almost black in the low light, and filled with intensity. He radiates warmth, like a dark, burning star. He smells like sharp, sour cherry, and Phil knows he tastes even better. He wants to slide his hands up Dan\u2019s sides, under the loose ghost t-shirt. He wants to draw Dan towards him, to suck another hickey into his pale skin, to kiss the grey, angry bruises on his face.</p><p>Dan\u2019s fingers rake through Phil\u2019s hair. He leans down, pushing their lips together; Phil can feel him tremble. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he whispers in the non-existent space between their mouths.</p><p>Hesitantly, Phil lets his hands float to Dan\u2019s sides. He stays on top of the t-shirt though, for now. He wants to get this right; this moment is weighty with the importance of something new and filled with potential. With every sentence he utters to reassure Dan of his feelings, Phil beats another of the demons Dan carries on his bony shoulders back into the shadows. But even now he can feel them watching suspiciously, waiting for a sign that Phil might fuck this all up, so they can spring back to their former positions.</p><p>Phil matches that dark, unwavering gaze and doesn\u2019t let himself so much as blink. \u201cYou deserve so much more than you believe, Dan.\u201d</p><p>Dan kisses him again, and this time Phil tastes salt water, like a thin film between their lips. He winds his arms around Dan\u2019s waist, holding tightly. They kiss for what seems like hours; Dan falls forwards, pushing Phil to the bed, making it too easy to just lose themselves in the taste, the touch of each other. Phil is too afraid to do more than just stroke lightly over Dan\u2019s waist, his arms, his face. Dan too, seems to feel this is more than enough, and keeps his hands in Phil\u2019s hair, then winds them around his neck. Eventually, Phil is not sure when, but they must slow, and then stop. He drifts on the periphery of sleep, fingers trailing across warm skin, the duvet keeping the cold wind from the open window at bay.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, by the way,\u201d Dan says into the silence, though perhaps Phil is already dreaming. \u201cI don\u2019t think I said it, before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Phil replies. His smile is warm, treacly across his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not\u2026 say it very much,\u201d Dan warns him, and Phil just smiles wider. \u201cI\u2019m gonna say right off the bat that I doubt I\u2019ll be very good at\u2026 all that. But I do, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Phil is almost asleep, sure, but he\u2019s still got enough energy to tease Dan a little.</p><p>Dan swats him in the arm. \u201cFuck off, once was hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Phil prods him in the ribs. \u201cDan, what do you promise?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs. There\u2019s a silence, and Phil wonders if maybe he won\u2019t be able to summon the courage to utter it a second time, if maybe he\u2019s fallen asleep. Then, there\u2019s the light graze of cherry scented lips by his ear, and the silky warm rush of Dan\u2019s breath as he whispers: \u201cI love you, nerd.\u201d</p><p><b>(Chapter Twelve coming next Tuesday at 8pm GMT!)</b></p>",

He blinks, but those cobalt eyes don&rsquo;t dissipate. The grinning Gengar on Phil&rsquo;s hat remains exactly where it is, level with Dan&rsquo;s eyes as Phil sinks down from his tiptoes. Dan&rsquo;s lips are vibrating, his breaths are shallow. As he floats down from the astral plane, the noises and sights and smells outside of Phil and his melon conditioner and caramel flavoured lips re-emerge. There&rsquo;s a great deal of elevated chatter from all sides of the room, which Dan slowly realises is probably about him. He hears someone laugh, then shout &ldquo;woo, get it, guys&rdquo;. Warmth spreads through his cheeks, down his neck.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Dan says; his voice is a husk of itself. He feels as if someone slipped something stronger than caffeine into the espresso he chucked down a while ago. &ldquo;I should get back to work. My shift doesn&rsquo;t end for another hour.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s face falls. He&rsquo;s looking at Dan like he&rsquo;s worried he&rsquo;s about to break into pieces. &ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo; He shifts from foot to foot. &ldquo;Will you come over after? I&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Dan says.</p><p>He glances around, room spinning into a blur of muted colours and half-familiar faces. It seems most of the coffee shop is watching them, their caffeinated blood and elevated heart rates pushing excitable, gossip-hungry expressions onto their faces. Dan takes a step backwards. The floor feels spongy beneath his feet. The air is viscous; breathing it is like swallowing lungfuls of warm water. Just as he&rsquo;s starting to turn from Phil, to walk back towards the counter, back to something that makes sense, something solid and sure, Phil grabs his wrist. Dan can do nothing except stare at the spot where Phil&rsquo;s skin meets his, utterly dazed.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, are you okay?&rdquo; Phil asks, panicked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I just went straight in there, that was probably really stupid. I&rsquo;m just&hellip; trying to catch up with my feelings.&rdquo; He frowns, shaking his head. &ldquo;Or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Dan swallows. Phil&rsquo;s fingers are tightly locked around his wrist, but it isn&rsquo;t painful. It&rsquo;s quite grounding. He lifts his eyes to meet Phil&rsquo;s, heart speeding up. &ldquo;This is a lot to process. Let&rsquo;s talk after&hellip;&rdquo; Dan flaps his hand to the general vicinity of the caf&eacute;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay,&rdquo; Phil agrees. Neither of them move, too caught up in their unbroken stare. Tentatively, Phil&rsquo;s thumb sweeps back and forth over the back of Dan&rsquo;s hand. It&rsquo;s been sore ever since he punched Hardy. It&rsquo;s a sweet, simple gesture, one that melts Dan&rsquo;s heart. He feels a slow, cautious smile creeping up. Before it can fully form, Phil releases him, cheeks softly pink. He shoves his hands into his back pockets. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just&hellip; go sit down then. Let me know when you&rsquo;re ready to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want a coffee?&rdquo; Dan asks. He pauses, awkwardly flapping a hand in the air. &ldquo;On me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay,&rdquo; Phil says, beaming. &ldquo;The usual.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>As the streetlights splash warm, custard yellows over the two of them, Phil reaches out and takes Dan&rsquo;s hand. Dan is so startled he almost trips, but Phil&rsquo;s grip stabilises him.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; Dan asks, unable to hide the hiccup of laughter that escapes.</p><p>Phil is the picture of innocence. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shocking, I&rsquo;m sure, but I&rsquo;m not the&hellip; holding hands type.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll cope.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s fingers slip between Dan&rsquo;s, tightening considerably.</p><p>Dan thinks about protesting further, but considering it would more than likely be pointless, he doesn&rsquo;t bother. This whole night has been so surreal, he can cope with this one further peculiarity. As they continue walking, Dan&rsquo;s fingers start to curl around Phil&rsquo;s of their own accord. He&rsquo;s never held anyone&rsquo;s hand before in this way; he never imagined it would feel this natural. Dan had been under the impression that couples only did the cutesy stuff to rub their romance in everyone&rsquo;s faces, the way an Instagram model posts photos of a brunch they won&rsquo;t be eating. Perhaps there&rsquo;s something to this PDA-lark, after all. </p><p>The caf&eacute; is a twenty minute walk from Phil&rsquo;s; with each step, Dan is painfully aware of the unnatural silence bubbled around them. Usually, Phil&rsquo;s chatter is constant, to the point where Dan rarely needs to interject. Now, he&rsquo;s quiet, just letting their joined hands swing gently to and fro. Ten minutes pass this way, and Dan can&rsquo;t take the slew of paranoid thoughts pounding in his mind a second longer.</p><p>&ldquo;I need a cigarette,&rdquo; he says, digging in his pocket. He finds the pack and draws it out, then pauses, looking pointedly down at Phil&rsquo;s hand, clasped in his. &ldquo;Uh..&rdquo;</p><p>Phil is smiling, eyebrows raised, feigning ignorance. &ldquo;Problem?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan just rolls his eyes, then nudges the pack open with his nose, using his teeth to pluck one of the Djarums out. Phil watches in amusement as he struggles to tuck the pack away, then draw out a lighter and light the end, all with one hand. He manages, just, then shoots Phil a withering look.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, nerd,&rdquo; Dan says, smoke streaming through his lips, then tugs on Phil&rsquo;s hand, and they walk on.</p><p>*</p><p>When they step over Phil&rsquo;s threshold, Mrs Lester&rsquo;s foot is on the bottom stair, just heading up. She turns in surprise, a smile spreading over her tired face. Dan tries not to overthink it when Phil releases his hand at the sight of her, but without it, he feels wobbly, as if it was keeping him balanced.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hello boys,&rdquo; Mrs Lester says. &ldquo;Did you have a nice-&rdquo; She stops, gasping, and approaches Dan, hands outstretched. &ldquo;Oh Dan, honey! Look at you!&rdquo;</p><p>Her small hands cradle his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says, remembering. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil told me you were in a bit of a tussle,&rdquo; she says, tutting. Her fingers stroke lightly over the bruises. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was this bad. You must be more careful with yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Her words don&rsquo;t irritate him, surprisingly. Despite her mumsy tone, Dan knows it&rsquo;s coming from a place of genuine love and concern. Something he forgets Phil&rsquo;s mum is all too happy to bestow upon him, no questions asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I was dumb,&rdquo; Dan readily admits. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be doing it again in a hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>She tuts again, but removes her hands from his face, letting them fall to her sides. She turns to Phil. &ldquo;Look after him, won&rsquo;t you darling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will, Mum.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs Lester sighs, moving back towards the stairs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just off to bed then, loves. Are you hungry? There&rsquo;s some dinner left in the fridge.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil glances at Dan questioningly. He leans in close to whisper, &ldquo;when was the last time you ate?&rdquo;</p><p>Mind blanking, Dan shrugs. &ldquo;Honestly don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, mum,&rdquo; Phil calls, already headed for the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs Lester,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kath, love,&rdquo; she reminds him for the umpteenth time. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, of course. Night.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hunger had transcended physical sensation until the scent of Kath&rsquo;s lasagne, heating up in the microwave, filled his nostrils. He eats the slice Phil hands him in seconds, leaning against one of the kitchen counters.</p><p>&ldquo;This is amazing,&rdquo; Dan says, licking the fork clean. &ldquo;Your mum&rsquo;s a genius.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughs, still chewing. &ldquo;You inhaled that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guess I was starving,&rdquo; Dan says with a frown, trying to remember the last time he ate a hot meal.</p><p>He goes to the sink to wash his bowl, as he&rsquo;s done countless times in Phil&rsquo;s kitchen. Just as he&rsquo;s placed it on the drying rack, he turns to find Phil has crowded up behind him, so close it makes Dan jump. Again, his fingertips tingle, and his heart leaps into his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil half-whispers. He brushes Dan&rsquo;s cheek, lightly, just with his fingertips. &ldquo;Could I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The end of the question is lost, because Dan closes the millimetres between their mouths. His mind still swims with questions, with confusion and doubt and anxiety about what this all means, but Phil is gorgeous, and he&rsquo;s adorably unsure. If Dan could find the courage, which seems to have entirely abandoned him, he&rsquo;d take Phil upstairs right now and greedily drink down this epiphany he&rsquo;s apparently had in every possible way he could. As it happens, Phil is the one to pull Dan towards the stairs. He abandons his half-eaten meal in favour of leading Dan up to his room, stopping every few seconds to kiss him again. Each press of his lips is preceded by a sweet, hesitant glance into Dan&rsquo;s eyes, as if to check whether it&rsquo;s still okay, whether Dan still wants it. His cute, completely redundant nervousness only makes him more difficult to resist. </p><p>Phil closes his bedroom door behind them, softly. Dan sits on his bed, watching as Phil draws the curtains, switches on his bedside lamp, turns off the overhead light. He sits beside Dan once he&rsquo;s run out of tasks, and winds their fingers together again. This time, Dan doesn&rsquo;t complain. For a few endless moments, they just sit quietly, hands joined. This moment feels climactic somehow, as if they&rsquo;re supposed to be in the throes of some great passionate exchange that&rsquo;s been building in all the years they&rsquo;ve known one another. But Dan, for perhaps the first time, doesn&rsquo;t want to do anything else just yet. He wants to sit, and make sense of what&rsquo;s happening, and for Phil to not let go of his hand while he sorts it all out.</p><p>He&rsquo;s not certain, but he thinks Phil might feel very much the same.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to watch Buffy?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan lets out a breathy laugh. He nods. &ldquo;Yeah, okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil does let go then, but he gives Dan&rsquo;s hand a squeeze, as if to say it won&rsquo;t be forever. He gets out some pyjamas for them both, then switches on his TV, pretending to be busy sorting out the settings and wires while Dan gets changed. It takes a lot of willpower not to stare as Phil strips off right in front of him, in light of all that&rsquo;s happened this evening, but Dan can&rsquo;t help but feel it&rsquo;s not quite the time. Phil joins him on the bed, and they turn their attention to the episode beginning, though Dan is quite sure that neither of them are able to focus on a single word. It&rsquo;s so strange, to do something so familiar, something he&rsquo;s done with Phil just like this, hundreds of times, and for it to feel totally alien. The negative part of Dan&rsquo;s brain whispers cruel things to him. </p><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve crossed the line of friendship, you can never go back.</p><p>He squashes the thought down as best he can, but it doesn&rsquo;t entirely fade. A minute or so passes, and Phil finds his hand again. It&rsquo;s soothing, and sweet, so Dan squeezes hard. Phil turns, concerned, and lifts his arm, places it around Dan&rsquo;s shoulders, pulling him close.</p><p>*</p><p>As soon as Phil opens his eyes, he knows he is alone. The thought panics him instantly, and he sits bolt upright, not even noticing that his bedroom is still shrouded in darkness, or that his window is cracked open, letting a chill in. He blinks, reaching blindly for his glasses. His stomach lurches, and he curses at himself internally for being so impulsive, for acting so rashly, for scaring Dan off by unloading too much, too quickly. He&rsquo;s already projecting to where he will start looking for Dan &ndash; his house, Ozone, the caf&eacute; &ndash; when a movement catches his eye. There&rsquo;s a small orange glow in the corner by the window. Phil sucks in a breath, the unmistakeable scent of smoky cherry dancing in the frigid air. He freezes, then switches on his bedside light.</p><p>The soft, dim light is just enough to illuminate the shape of Dan, sat on the window ledge, smoking out of the open window. It takes a moment for Phil&rsquo;s eyes to adjust to the sight of him. He&rsquo;s wearing Phil&rsquo;s black t-shirt, which is covered in tiny white ghosts. He&rsquo;s so skinny at the moment that it hangs off him; he looks ethereal himself, like he&rsquo;s only half here.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Phil says, quietly. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan turns at the sound of his voice. His expression is haunted. His fingers play with the pearl in his ear. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil sits up properly, bleary from exhaustion. His stomach is knotted with nerves. &ldquo;Come back to bed, I&rsquo;ll stay up and chat with you for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan takes a long drag on his cigarette, then stubs it out, chucking the butt out of the window. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop thinking&hellip;&rdquo; Dan starts to say. Phil waits for him to complete the sentence, but he seems to think better of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Phil urges. &ldquo;Please. Is it too much? Did I overwhelm you?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan swings his legs round, placing his feet on the desk beneath the ledge. He sits there, hands underneath his thighs, deliberating. &ldquo;That painting you did. Of Amanda. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.&rdquo; He pauses, eyes trained on Phil&rsquo;s carpet. &ldquo;It took you so long. All that time and energy. I just don&rsquo;t understand why you would do it if&hellip; if you didn&rsquo;t actually feel that way about her.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nods, voice fluttery with nerves. &ldquo;I get why you&rsquo;d think that.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes are distant when he lifts them. &ldquo;You told me, at the caf&eacute;, that you were just&hellip; projecting your feelings for me onto her, right?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lump in Dan&rsquo;s throat, strangling his words, though he&rsquo;s trying his best to hide it. </p><p>Phil nods again. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But if that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Dan shakes his head. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be me you&rsquo;d painted sky high on a big canvas? It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I show you something?&rdquo; Phil interrupts.</p><p>He&rsquo;s already throwing the covers off himself, feet landing on the soft carpet. He goes to his desk, plucks a sketchbook at random from the dozens stacked about. He hands it to Dan, who takes it wordlessly.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just look inside,&rdquo; Phil tells him.</p><p>He crosses back to sink onto the bed, waiting. He&rsquo;s bone-tired, still - it must be 3am, or thereabouts - but he can feel the importance of this. Dan opens the sketchbook cautiously, clearly puzzled. As he takes in what&rsquo;s inside, his expression melts into surprise, then awe. The corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth twitches. He can feel his cheeks pinkening as Dan turns page after page, but it&rsquo;s worth it.</p><p>&ldquo;How- when did you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I painted one picture of Amanda, and honestly I hated every second,&rdquo; Phil says, sincerely. &ldquo;I was trying to get it so perfect, because I felt like it needed to be this&hellip; accurate portrait of her, y&rsquo;know? I don&rsquo;t paint like that normally. Usually I find something, or someone, to inspire me, and I just let myself run with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are so many,&rdquo; Dan breathes, wide-eyed.</p><p>Phil can&rsquo;t help laughing then. When Dan shoots him a questioning look, he only laughs harder. &ldquo;Check one of the others. There&rsquo;s a few stacked on the desk there. Some in the drawers. I&rsquo;ve got some more in my bag. Couple in the studio, too.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, Dan is still. Then, he leans down to pluck another sketchbook from a pile on the desk. He opens it at a random page, balks at the contents, then promptly closes it again. He leans down for a second time, grabbing three more sketchbooks. He looks in each one, flicking through the worn pages like it&rsquo;s a flipbook.</p><p>As he watches Dan, Phil starts to grow uneasy. It occurs to him that perhaps this seems a tad obsessive. Then Dan drops the books to the desk, the sound of them hitting the wood with a thud. He grips the ledge for a second, knuckles white, staring down at the ground. Phil&rsquo;s breathing quickens, suddenly nervous of Dan&rsquo;s reaction. Dan clambers down from the ledge one careful foot at a time, crouching on the desk, then sliding to the floor. He crosses the room to Phil, still sat on the bed, and stands before him. His fingers are shaking, Phil notices.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil&hellip; what- why would you&hellip;&rdquo; he trails off.</p><p>Phil swallows, not sure how to explain without weirding Dan out more. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my muse, Dan. I squeezed out one painting of Amanda that I don&rsquo;t even like. One that doesn&rsquo;t represent me at all. I can&rsquo;t even count the times I&rsquo;ve drawn you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s lips disappear as he presses them together. &ldquo;The way you draw me. You make me look&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; Phil finishes for him. &ldquo;Because you are. Every time I look, I see new colours in your eyes. I see you smile in a different way. It&rsquo;s so inspiring, just watching you, just having you in front of me. I&rsquo;ve filled so many sketchbooks with you, but I could fill a thousand more, just trying to capture your- your&hellip;&rdquo; Phil flaps a hand in the air, losing the word. &ldquo;Essence.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan slides a knee onto the bed at Phil&rsquo;s hip, then brings his other up on the other side, seating himself in Phil&rsquo;s lap. Phil might have stopped breathing, but he&rsquo;s too shocked to check. Dan is the kind of severe, electrifying beauty that is almost frightening to behold. The sort of exotic flower you should observe from a safe distance, but never touch, lest it poison you with one prick of its thorns. To have him this close is maddening; his eyes are almost black in the low light, and filled with intensity. He radiates warmth, like a dark, burning star. He smells like sharp, sour cherry, and Phil knows he tastes even better. He wants to slide his hands up Dan&rsquo;s sides, under the loose ghost t-shirt. He wants to draw Dan towards him, to suck another hickey into his pale skin, to kiss the grey, angry bruises on his face.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s fingers rake through Phil&rsquo;s hair. He leans down, pushing their lips together; Phil can feel him tremble. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve you,&rdquo; he whispers in the non-existent space between their mouths.</p><p>Hesitantly, Phil lets his hands float to Dan&rsquo;s sides. He stays on top of the t-shirt though, for now. He wants to get this right; this moment is weighty with the importance of something new and filled with potential. With every sentence he utters to reassure Dan of his feelings, Phil beats another of the demons Dan carries on his bony shoulders back into the shadows. But even now he can feel them watching suspiciously, waiting for a sign that Phil might fuck this all up, so they can spring back to their former positions.</p><p>Phil matches that dark, unwavering gaze and doesn&rsquo;t let himself so much as blink. &ldquo;You deserve so much more than you believe, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan kisses him again, and this time Phil tastes salt water, like a thin film between their lips. He winds his arms around Dan&rsquo;s waist, holding tightly. They kiss for what seems like hours; Dan falls forwards, pushing Phil to the bed, making it too easy to just lose themselves in the taste, the touch of each other. Phil is too afraid to do more than just stroke lightly over Dan&rsquo;s waist, his arms, his face. Dan too, seems to feel this is more than enough, and keeps his hands in Phil&rsquo;s hair, then winds them around his neck. Eventually, Phil is not sure when, but they must slow, and then stop. He drifts on the periphery of sleep, fingers trailing across warm skin, the duvet keeping the cold wind from the open window at bay.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, by the way,&rdquo; Dan says into the silence, though perhaps Phil is already dreaming. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I said it, before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; Phil replies. His smile is warm, treacly across his mouth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might not&hellip; say it very much,&rdquo; Dan warns him, and Phil just smiles wider. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna say right off the bat that I doubt I&rsquo;ll be very good at&hellip; all that. But I do, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Phil is almost asleep, sure, but he&rsquo;s still got enough energy to tease Dan a little.</p><p>Dan swats him in the arm. &ldquo;Fuck off, once was hard enough.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil prods him in the ribs. &ldquo;Dan, what do you promise?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sighs. There&rsquo;s a silence, and Phil wonders if maybe he won&rsquo;t be able to summon the courage to utter it a second time, if maybe he&rsquo;s fallen asleep. Then, there&rsquo;s the light graze of cherry scented lips by his ear, and the silky warm rush of Dan&rsquo;s breath as he whispers: &ldquo;I love you, nerd.&rdquo;</p><p><b>(Chapter Twelve coming next Tuesday at 8pm GMT!)</b></p>",

Phil is loud, excitable, and irritatingly happy all of the time.

He blinks, but those cobalt eyes don&rsquo;t dissipate. The grinning Gengar on Phil&rsquo;s hat remains exactly where it is, level with Dan&rsquo;s eyes as Phil sinks down from his tiptoes. Dan&rsquo;s lips are vibrating, his breaths are shallow. As he floats down from the astral plane, the noises and sights and smells outside of Phil and his melon conditioner and caramel flavoured lips re-emerge. There&rsquo;s a great deal of elevated chatter from all sides of the room, which Dan slowly realises is probably about him. He hears someone laugh, then shout &ldquo;woo, get it, guys&rdquo;. Warmth spreads through his cheeks, down his neck.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Dan says; his voice is a husk of itself. He feels as if someone slipped something stronger than caffeine into the espresso he chucked down a while ago. &ldquo;I should get back to work. My shift doesn&rsquo;t end for another hour.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Phil&rsquo;s face falls. He&rsquo;s looking at Dan like he&rsquo;s worried he&rsquo;s about to break into pieces. &ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo; He shifts from foot to foot. &ldquo;Will you come over after? I&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
