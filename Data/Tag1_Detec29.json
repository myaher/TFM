Going to his father\u2019s home in Ryme City, he encounters his father\u2019s Pokemon partner: a talking Pikachu only he can understand (Ryan Reynolds). They soon discover that Tim\u2019s father was investigating a mystery involving the father and son in charge of Ryme City, Howard and Roger Clifford (Bill Nighy and Chris Geere), and team up with junior reporter Lucy Stevens (Kathryn Newton), with assistance from his father\u2019s colleague Hideo Yoshida (Ken Watanabe) to find answers.</p><p>Oh yeah, and also a lot of Pokemon.</p><p>Ryan Reynolds has proven to be a host unto himself. Any scene involving him is naturally going to revolve around him. So when Justice Smith can keep up with him not only comedically but also dramatically and in serious scenes, that\u2019s pretty impressive. It also makes for amazing chemistry between these two, making every moment with them an absolute joy to watch. Add in Kathryn Newton playing a character who takes herself so absurdly seriously that it loops around multiple times into being funny, serious, and back into being funny again, there is no shortage of laughter to be found. But the film doesn\u2019t rely purely on laughter. Smith\u2019s character has an entire arc of dealing with the strange form of numbness that comes with grieving for someone who should have been a huge part of your life, but wasn\u2019t, and Smith absolutely sells it.</p><p>Which is not to say the plot is devoid of problems, because there are a few threads that could have done with a rewrite. The pacing is a little strange at times; a particular plot twist is set up for a while before the story dashes the concept, then immediately goes back on itself and plays the twist straight; there\u2019s a particular plot thread in the middle which, while leading into an amazing and creative scene, looks like it should play into the finale and rather pointedly doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Right, negatives over, and on that last point the creativity on display with the Pokemon is great. Not only with the Pokemon themselves, but with the world they\u2019ve built where Pokemon are an everyday thing. Ryme City absolutely feels like a place built around cooperation with Pokemon and it feels very real in places. Also, it\u2019s a big city with copious amounts of neon, so I predisposed to like it.</p><p>You really don\u2019t need to be a Pokemon fan to watch this. I\u2019m a casual fan at best, and I loved it. Compelling characters, fun if basic plot, great acting. It says something that Ryan Reynolds is one of the less noteworthy parts of the movie to talk about. Not to say Ryan Reynolds wasn\u2019t amazing, but there\u2019s just so much else to talk about! Go see it!</p>",

I\u2019m a casual fan at best, and I loved it. Compelling characters, fun if basic plot, great acting.

Give us more noir films that just take place in the pokemon universe!! Give us the buddy cop film we deserve between Harry, Tim and Pikachu!!\u00a0</li><li>Justice Smith is <i>amazing\u00a0</i></li><li>Seriously, the scene where he has to essentially monologue to the pikachu about how he should have gotten on that train, and how he didn\u2019t realize how much his dad cared\u00a0</li><li>honestly so many scenes with him?\u00a0</li><li>plus men are allowed to show emotion! he tears up when he finds his childhood room, and he\u2019s not mocked for it!\u00a0</li><li>but he monologues to this pikachu, and you forget that pikachu isn\u2019t really there</li><li>(Also!! props to Ryan Reynolds!!)\u00a0</li><li>(I know it exists, but I am not qualified to join the ableism discussion for personal reasons)\u00a0</li><li>I thought the relationship between Tim and Lucy was actually kind of cute? I can see how some of Pikachu\u2019s comments could be annoying, but in general I thought it was adorable - they\u2019re not in love at the end, there\u2019s no Big Damn Kiss, but they think each other are attractive (watch Lucy\u2019s face when Tim leaves her office) and make plans to meet up later, and that\u2019s it. I liked it. :D\u00a0</li><li>+ when was the last time there was a black/biracial man + white woman pairing, especially in a kids\u2019 movie? I\u2019m not trying to be snarky, I genuinely can\u2019t think of one?\u00a0</li><li>Shirtless Sebastian the Charizard partner was aces\u00a0</li><li>Pikachu has to sit in a children\u2019s seat!!\u00a0</li><li>Psyduck has his own baby carrier backpack thingy!!\u00a0</li><li>While the movie did do the traditional/cliche third act misunderstanding, it did it in a way I can\u2019t recall seeing? bc it didn\u2019t have the misunderstanding cause someone to be pushed away bc ppl thought he was a betrayer. Instead, Pikachu ran away of his own volition\u00a0</li><li>I need an album of Ryan Reynolds singing the theme song to children\u2019s cartoons\u00a0</li><li>The final battle was awesome. Dittos are creepy</li><li>And Ryan Reynolds acting at the end when he\u2019s a person again though!!\u00a0</li><li>Just look at his face\u00a0</li><li><i>look at it\u00a0</i></li><li>You can see so many emotions crossing his face - love, joy, tenderness, a little bit of sadness (bc he thinks that Tim is Leaving), all without saying a word\u00a0</li><li>He really is a good actor, if this movie is anything to go by\u00a0</li><li>I mean, I loved Deadpool, and I genuinely liked his acting in Green Lantern\u00a0</li><li>but those are comedies??\u00a0</li><li>But That Look On His Face as he gazes on Tim, you can believe that he loves his son, despite everything\u00a0</li><li>And his little\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like that\u201d when Tim asks if he can stay\u00a0</li><li>Poetic Cinema\u00a0</li><li>apparently Ryan Reynolds is only 42 years old, so he theoretically could be the parent of a 21 year old even though he does look young (Justice Smith is 24 this year come August, so if we go by actual actor ages, he\u2019d still be a young dad, but it\u2019d be theoretically possible\u00a0<br/></li><li>I really need more movies of buddy detective duo ex-estranged parent and son Tim and Harry Goodman PI w/ Pikachu solving crimes in the underbelly of Ryme city (and beyond) while learning how to Family Again while it\u2019s also a noir film bc???\u00a0</li><li>*grabby hands*\u00a0</li></ul>",
