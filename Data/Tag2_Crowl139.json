I think that&rsquo;d be soooo hot.\u201d</i></p><!-- more --><p>\u201c<i>Why\nthe hell would I be jealous? I feel <b>sorry </b>for whatever poor person\nhas your attention now,\u201d you scowl.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>She\ndoesn&rsquo;t have my attention,\u201d Lucifer shakes his head. \u201cShe just\nhas a convenient womb \u201c</i></p><p><i>Your\nstomach drops as you process his words. </i>\n</p><p>\u201c<i>You\ngot someone pregnant?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Oh\nyeah,\u201d he winks. \u201cAlthough I have to say, sweetheart, you&rsquo;re the\nmuch better lay. Oh baby, weren&rsquo;t you just so&hellip;..tight&hellip;.tight and\n<b>willing</b>. Why does someone so ughhhh have your love? Why do you\nput out for a guy like that and be so&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;enthusiastic\nabout it?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Because\nhe&rsquo;s not a total sociopath like you are,\u201d you point out. \u201cAnd I\nlove Crowley. Would you just drop this? I&rsquo;m never going to agree to\nbe your rent-a-womb.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>I\ndon&rsquo;t want <b>just</b> that,\u201d Lucifer captures you in his arms and\nyou&rsquo;re powerless to get away.</i></p><p><i>Whenever\nyou dreamed about Lucifer, it was clear he was controlling the\nnarrative. Sometimes you&rsquo;d be in some romantic beach walk or a forest\nstroll, sometimes it was a luxurious bedroom. He also controlled some\nof your actions. He&rsquo;d never make you do anything sordid but if he\nwanted you to stay still, you&rsquo;d just freeze up.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>What\ndo you want then?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>I\nwant you,\u201d Lucifer runs his slightly chilled fingers across your\ncheekbone and down to trace the line of your jaw. Then he tips your\nchin up so you&rsquo;re looking at him. \u201cThis little human nobody who\nresisted my best techniques for days. The little human who&rsquo;s thwarted\nme a few times. The little human who, when I wore her boyfriend&rsquo;s\nskin, made me feel wanted and loved. The little human who could bear\nme a child and live.\u201d</i></p><p><i>And\nthere was that uncharacteristically vulnerable side to him again. It\nalways made you uneasy with how much you felt pity for him. It made\nyou uneasy that you could rationalise his obsessive behaviour with\nthat fact that he&rsquo;d never experienced love or kindness.</i></p><p><i>His\nface is so close to yours now and you can see the lingering sadness\nin his gaze mixed with the raw need. </i>\n</p><p>\u201c<i>Just\nlet me have one last kiss before I go back to her,\u201d he pleads\nquietly.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>No,\u201d\nyou reply firmly. \u201cI&rsquo;m not falling for your shit again. I&rsquo;m happy\nwith Crowley. I <b>love </b>Crowley.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Not\nthe answer I wanted,\u201d his eyes flash. \u201cLet&rsquo;s just hope Crowley\nsticks around then, huh? Would be a shame if something happened to him&hellip;if you found out something about him&hellip;.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He\nsteps back quickly, moving so rapidly it&rsquo;s like you scalded him\nbefore he morphs back into the president.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Forgive\nme, little Tabitha., my little tabby cat. \u00a0I have places to go, my\nlittle secretary to protect. I hope it&rsquo;s a boy, you know? I&rsquo;d like\nthat.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>You&rsquo;re\ntwisted,\u201d you snarl. \u201cDon&rsquo;t threaten Crowley, <b>ever </b>and <b>never </b>try to come between us. Stop\ncoming to me in dreams. Stop parading your virility like I give a\nshit.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He\nappears in front of you, hand around your throat as he squeezes, not\nhard but enough to let you know he could snap your neck with no\neffort.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Be\ncareful, Tabitha. I enjoy you, I enjoy your stubbornness but don&rsquo;t\never think you&rsquo;re better than me or&hellip;\u201d</i></p><p><i>You\nfelt pain. Pain was gripping your entire body and Lucifer was just\nstaring down at you with a modicum of interest.</i></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n\u201cTabs?!\u201d</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;d apparently started screaming in real life because the next you\nknew, Dean and Sam were in your room, trying to shake you awake. \n</p><p>\nCrowley had long gone. He only ever stayed with you until you fell\nasleep before doing day to day admin down in Hell. You wished he were\nhere with you though.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d both brothers are holding you, half perched on\nthe bed.</p><p>\n\u201cAnother devil special wasn&rsquo;t it?\u201d Dean guesses.</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s every night,\u201d you start shaking. \u201cHe won&rsquo;t stop.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMaybe it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s a prophet?\u201d Sam guesses. \u201cI mean\nshe&rsquo;s got a connection to heavenly and demonic beings right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cChuck should&rsquo;ve just left me alone,\u201d you try to calm your racing\nheartbeat. \u201cLucifer\u2019s the president now by the way. My dream confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGoddamnit,\u201d Dean huffs.</p><p>\nBoth brothers sit fully on your bed. You knew this was going to be a\ntough conversation ahead.</p><p>\n\u201cWe can&rsquo;t go after the president like this,\u201d Sam sighs. \u201cHe&rsquo;d\nhave to be&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;out somewhere? A visit? We have no chance\ngetting into the White House.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd Tabs can&rsquo;t do this with us,\u201d Dean adds.</p><p>\n\u201cDean, she&rsquo;s dealt with him before. She&rsquo;s fine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe&rsquo;s <i>not</i> fine!\u201d Dean gestures. \u201cShe&rsquo;s having freaky\ndreams every night and she&rsquo;s terrified, Sammy. Look at her! We need\nto start stepping up and realising she can&rsquo;t do this alone. We need\nto help her out and get rid of this archdouchebag.\u201d</p><p>\nYou were a tough woman but even you knew your limits. Lucifer&rsquo;s\nconstant attention and efforts was wearing you down and you were\nbecoming afraid. He&rsquo;d gotten into your head and you felt like you\ncouldn&rsquo;t have one moment&rsquo;s peace away from him.</p><p>\n\u201cI can&rsquo;t do this, guys,\u201d you shake your head. \u201cI can&rsquo;t face him\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe get it,\u201d Sam strokes your back. \u201cI&rsquo;m not going to push you\ninto doing anything and I think you&rsquo;re making a mistake hiding from\nhim but I understand why you would want to.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGive her a break,\u201d Dean scowls. \u201cYou went a little nutso when\nLucifer was stalking <i>you</i>, remember?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBecause he wanted to possess my body, Dean.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah and he wants Tabs to be his baby mama. One is more scary than\nthe other. You just had Lucifer&rsquo;s essence wanting to be in you rather\nthan his&hellip;you know&hellip;johnson.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEww,\u201d Sam wrinkles his nose.</p><p>\n\u201cRight?!\u201d Dean throws his arms out. \u201cSo give her a break.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNormally I would say something like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m right here&rsquo; but you&rsquo;re\nright Dean,\u201d you murmur, staring at the bed covers.</p><p>\nDean looks like you&rsquo;ve just told him a girl covered in pizza with\nsome rare rock vinyls is waiting for him in his bedroom. His eyes\npractically glow with happiness.</p><p>\n\u201cSee that, I&rsquo;m right,\u201d he smiles smugly.</p><p>\n\u201cGoddamnit, Dean,\u201d Sam mutters. \u201cAlright, we&rsquo;ll chase after\nLucifer. You stay here-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo, I&rsquo;m not staying here,\u201d you shake your head fervently. \u201cI&rsquo;m\ngoing to stay with Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIn Hell?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley will know some magic to help or at least be able to watch\nover me in my dreams,\u201d you explain.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, if Lucifer smokes out of the president he can get you\nthere. He can&rsquo;t get here, it&rsquo;s warded,\u201d Sam says gently.</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t care, I just need&hellip;.\u201d you trail off, biting your lip\nbut it doesn&rsquo;t stop the lump in your throat or the tears from\nstarting to form in your eyes and start tracking down your face.</p><p>\nNeither of the Winchester brothers know what to do now. You&rsquo;ve rarely\ncried around either of them but the stress and the disrupted sleep\nwas getting to you in a bad way.</p><p>\n\u201cOkay, do it,\u201d Dean nods solemnly. \u201cYou know I&rsquo;m not his\nbiggest fan but if he helps, go to him Tabs.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you manage to get out.</p><p>\nDean whips out his phone and starts dialling Crowley which you didn&rsquo;t\nexpect at all. In fact it was the last thing you expected.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, it&rsquo;s me. Well gee, don&rsquo;t sound so surprised,\u201d Dean makes a\nface as he walks with the phone. \u201cNo, it&rsquo;s Tabs. She needs you.\nShe-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat&rsquo;s wrong?\u201d Crowley asks immediately upon appearing.</p><p>\n\u201cWow, can&rsquo;t even get takeout delivered that fast,\u201d Dean widens\nhis eyes before shaking his head. \u201cCome on, Sammy. Let&rsquo;s leave them\nalone.\u201d</p><p>\nYou hear something suspiciously like 'I never knew you could be this\nmature&rsquo; from Sam as they both head out, closing the door behind them.\n</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re crying,\u201d Crowley says softly, bundling you into his\nembrace. \u201cWhy are you crying, pet?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLucifer.\u201d</p><p>\nThe grip tightens and you can hear the growl starting in his chest.</p><p>\n\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAgain,\u201d you affirm. \u201cTake me with you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHell is not a place for you, darling. We both know this. We&rsquo;ve\ntried it before and-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t care. Take me with you. I can&rsquo;t stand it any more. You can\nhelp me.\u201d</p><p>\nHe goes quiet for a time, rocking back and forth with you to calm you\ndown. Just being in his presence is helping you enormously.</p><p>\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he finally agrees. \u201cPack some things and say your\ngoodbyes to the Chuckle Brothers.\u201d</p><p>\nYou do so, eager to get out of the bunker. It&rsquo;d been so suffocating\nbeing here lately and you were glad to be leaving for a little while.</p><p>\nWhen Crowley appears in his quarters with you, you immediately drag\nhim to the big four poster bed, scrambling onto the silk sheets. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re sending me mixed signals, love,\u201d Crowley raises an\neyebrow. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI just need to be close,\u201d you tell him before taking off his\novercoat, jacket and shirt, leaving his chest bare for you to lie on.</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ve never seen you like this,\u201d Crowley starts petting your\nhair. \u201cYou&rsquo;re positively timid.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI never get any rest,\u201d you murmur. \u201cIf it&rsquo;s not my dreams, I\nhave these awful visions all the time. I&rsquo;m cracking up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ve got you,\u201d Crowley leans down and kisses your forehead.\n\u201cI&rsquo;ll always protect you, pet. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGet some sleep. I promise you won&rsquo;t dream.\u201d</p><p>\nYou trust him so you just let yourself absorb the warmth from his skin,\nthe slow movements of his chest and his hand which keeps stroking\nyour hair. You feel your body just relax, all the coiled muscles just\nletting go and eventually the exhaustion pulls you under.</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\nHe&rsquo;s right. You don&rsquo;t dream.</p><p>\nYou woke up some time later, still in the position you fell asleep in\nonly with Crowley humming some melody you didn&rsquo;t recognise.</p><p>\n\u201cOh hello, kitten,\u201d you hear him say. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cA lot,\u201d you admit, rubbing the remnants of sleep out of your\neyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlways, my love.\u201d</p><p>\nYou look up at him, seeing the pure affection sparkling in his eyes.\nIt was quite mesmeric in a way. You reach up, taking his bristled\ncheek in your hand before kissing him softly. \n</p><p>\nIt starts out innocent but becomes something more heated very\nquickly, even though you didn\u2019t intend it to. Crowley pushes you onto your back so he can lean over you,\nhis hands gently stroking your sides. You can&rsquo;t help but let soft\nmoans sound out as you move into his touch. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou are sublime,\u201d he rasps out, drawing back for a second before\nhe dives back on you and you feel the warm metal of your amulet\ntickling against your skin as he fully seats himself between your\nlegs. \n</p><p>\nYou needed this, you needed him. You needed him to stake a claim so\nto speak, to feel like you were his completely. Lucifer was trying to\ntake that away from you but you wouldn&rsquo;t let him.</p><p>\n\u201cYou <i>are</i> mine,\u201d Crowley catches the thought. \u201cI have\nfought so hard to show you that, to be <i>worthy</i> of that. Don&rsquo;t\ndoubt it now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI love you,\u201d you press your forehead to his.</p><p>\n\u201cI love you always, my kitten.\u201d</p><p>\nJust as you start kissing again, your phone rings out, the ringtone\nunfamiliar.</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s probably important,\u201d Crowley breaks off, giving you a\nrueful smirk. \u201cPerhaps Dean&rsquo;s eaten Sam&rsquo;s chocolate protein balls\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\nYou tap him on the chest in mock chastisement before answering it.</p><p>\n\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabs?!\u201d comes Dean&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you okay?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cUh no. No we&rsquo;re not okay. Listen, I got one phone call-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou got arrested?!\u201d your voice pitches up.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah kinda&hellip;.by the FBI. We went for him, the big L I mean. He&rsquo;s outta the\npresident now but he knocked up the secretary. Cas has her but we\ndidn&rsquo;t manage to get out in time so&hellip;help.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I&rsquo;ll do what I can. Sit tight.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re cute,\u201d comes the sarcastic reply. \u201cHurry up. Orange is\nnot my colour.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTrouble?\u201d Crowley surmises as you hang up.</p><p>\n\u201cWell Lucifer is no longer the president but he&rsquo;s got another girl\npregnant and Sam and Dean are in holding cells, god knows where.\nMaybe the Pentagon?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust another ordinary day, hmm?\u201d Crowley raises an eyebrow. \u201cI\nassume they need my assistance as well?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cProbably,\u201d you nod. \u201cAt least I got some rest then.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou can always come back once they&rsquo;re free. I admit, I was\nsceptical this could work but without my odious mother hanging around\nall the time, this is like bunking off work to have fun in the\nstorage cupboard.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcept the storage cupboard is an expensive bed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell I can make a cupboard if you really want to. Perhaps a pencil\nskirt and a blouse with a criminally low amount of buttons?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, I need to help them,\u201d you move out from under him. \u201cWe\ncan talk sexy roleplay when they&rsquo;re not being detained in Guantanamo\nor wherever.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m holding you to that,\u201d he winks. \u201cCome on, pet. Let&rsquo;s save\nBeavis and Butthead.\u201d</p><p>\nYou at least had taken comfort that Lucifer was not in an almost\nunreachable vessel any more. That gave you a bit more confidence\nback. Coupled with Crowley&rsquo;s support and taking care of you, you were\nrefreshed in a way that you hadn&rsquo;t been for weeks. \n</p><p>\nMaybe all you really needed was some alone time, some bonding time\nwithout interference. There&rsquo;d been precious little of that lately\nwhat with all the catastrophes.</p><p>\nNow you were ready to face the world&hellip;.if only you could find where\nthe hell the boys were that is&hellip;.</p><p><br/></p><p>____</p><p>Taglist</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIqJDwp21syOZ6QnVrKIGOw\">@astridstark13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkaWEeXj9PiJBBZ4NVr5pg\">@oldsoulevy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a></p>",

Sometimes you\u2019d be in some romantic beach walk or a forest\nstroll, sometimes it was a luxurious bedroom. He also controlled some\nof your actions. He\u2019d never make you do anything sordid but if he\nwanted you to stay still, you\u2019d just freeze up.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>What\ndo you want then?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>I\nwant you,\u201d Lucifer runs his slightly chilled fingers across your\ncheekbone and down to trace the line of your jaw.

The little human who could bear\nme a child and live.\u201d</i></p><p><i>And\nthere was that uncharacteristically vulnerable side to him again.

You wished he were\nhere with you though.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d both brothers are holding you, half perched on\nthe bed.</p><p>\n\u201cAnother devil special wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Dean guesses.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s every night,\u201d you start shaking. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s a prophet?\u201d Sam guesses. \u201cI mean\nshe\u2019s got a connection to heavenly and demonic beings right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cChuck should\u2019ve just left me alone,\u201d you try to calm your racing\nheartbeat. \u201cLucifer\u2019s the president now by the way. My dream confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGoddamnit,\u201d Dean huffs.</p><p>\nBoth brothers sit fully on your bed. You knew this was going to be a\ntough conversation ahead.</p><p>\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go after the president like this,\u201d Sam sighs. \u201cHe\u2019d\nhave to be\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026out somewhere? A visit? We have no chance\ngetting into the White House.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd Tabs can\u2019t do this with us,\u201d Dean adds.</p><p>\n\u201cDean, she\u2019s dealt with him before. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe\u2019s <i>not</i> fine!\u201d Dean gestures. \u201cShe\u2019s having freaky\ndreams every night and she\u2019s terrified, Sammy. Look at her! We need\nto start stepping up and realising she can\u2019t do this alone. We need\nto help her out and get rid of this archdouchebag.\u201d</p><p>\nYou were a tough woman but even you knew your limits. Lucifer\u2019s\nconstant attention and efforts was wearing you down and you were\nbecoming afraid. He\u2019d gotten into your head and you felt like you\ncouldn\u2019t have one moment\u2019s peace away from him.</p><p>\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this, guys,\u201d you shake your head. \u201cI can\u2019t face him\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe get it,\u201d Sam strokes your back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to push you\ninto doing anything and I think you\u2019re making a mistake hiding from\nhim but I understand why you would want to.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGive her a break,\u201d Dean scowls. \u201cYou went a little nutso when\nLucifer was stalking <i>you</i>, remember?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBecause he wanted to possess my body, Dean.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah and he wants Tabs to be his baby mama. One is more scary than\nthe other. You just had Lucifer\u2019s essence wanting to be in you rather\nthan his\u2026you know\u2026johnson.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEww,\u201d Sam wrinkles his nose.</p><p>\n\u201cRight?!\u201d Dean throws his arms out. \u201cSo give her a break.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNormally I would say something like \u2018I\u2019m right here\u2019 but you\u2019re\nright Dean,\u201d you murmur, staring at the bed covers.</p><p>\nDean looks like you\u2019ve just told him a girl covered in pizza with\nsome rare rock vinyls is waiting for him in his bedroom. His eyes\npractically glow with happiness.</p><p>\n\u201cSee that, I\u2019m right,\u201d he smiles smugly.</p><p>\n\u201cGoddamnit, Dean,\u201d Sam mutters. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll chase after\nLucifer. You stay here-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not staying here,\u201d you shake your head fervently. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to stay with Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIn Hell?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley will know some magic to help or at least be able to watch\nover me in my dreams,\u201d you explain.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, if Lucifer smokes out of the president he can get you\nthere. He can\u2019t get here, it\u2019s warded,\u201d Sam says gently.</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, I just need\u2026.\u201d you trail off, biting your lip\nbut it doesn\u2019t stop the lump in your throat or the tears from\nstarting to form in your eyes and start tracking down your face.</p><p>\nNeither of the Winchester brothers know what to do now. You\u2019ve rarely\ncried around either of them but the stress and the disrupted sleep\nwas getting to you in a bad way.</p><p>\n\u201cOkay, do it,\u201d Dean nods solemnly. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not his\nbiggest fan but if he helps, go to him Tabs.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you manage to get out.</p><p>\nDean whips out his phone and starts dialling Crowley which you didn\u2019t\nexpect at all. In fact it was the last thing you expected.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. Well gee, don\u2019t sound so surprised,\u201d Dean makes a\nface as he walks with the phone. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Tabs. She needs you.\nShe-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Crowley asks immediately upon appearing.</p><p>\n\u201cWow, can\u2019t even get takeout delivered that fast,\u201d Dean widens\nhis eyes before shaking his head. \u201cCome on, Sammy. Let\u2019s leave them\nalone.\u201d</p><p>\nYou hear something suspiciously like 'I never knew you could be this\nmature\u2019 from Sam as they both head out, closing the door behind them.\n</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d Crowley says softly, bundling you into his\nembrace. \u201cWhy are you crying, pet?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLucifer.\u201d</p><p>\nThe grip tightens and you can hear the growl starting in his chest.</p><p>\n\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAgain,\u201d you affirm. \u201cTake me with you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHell is not a place for you, darling. We both know this. We\u2019ve\ntried it before and-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. Take me with you. I can\u2019t stand it any more. You can\nhelp me.\u201d</p><p>\nHe goes quiet for a time, rocking back and forth with you to calm you\ndown. Just being in his presence is helping you enormously.</p><p>\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he finally agrees. \u201cPack some things and say your\ngoodbyes to the Chuckle Brothers.\u201d</p><p>\nYou do so, eager to get out of the bunker. It\u2019d been so suffocating\nbeing here lately and you were glad to be leaving for a little while.</p><p>\nWhen Crowley appears in his quarters with you, you immediately drag\nhim to the big four poster bed, scrambling onto the silk sheets. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re sending me mixed signals, love,\u201d Crowley raises an\neyebrow. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI just need to be close,\u201d you tell him before taking off his\novercoat, jacket and shirt, leaving his chest bare for you to lie on.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you like this,\u201d Crowley starts petting your\nhair. \u201cYou\u2019re positively timid.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI never get any rest,\u201d you murmur. \u201cIf it\u2019s not my dreams, I\nhave these awful visions all the time. I\u2019m cracking up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Crowley leans down and kisses your forehead.\n\u201cI\u2019ll always protect you, pet. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGet some sleep. I promise you won\u2019t dream.\u201d</p><p>\nYou trust him so you just let yourself absorb the warmth from his skin,\nthe slow movements of his chest and his hand which keeps stroking\nyour hair. You feel your body just relax, all the coiled muscles just\nletting go and eventually the exhaustion pulls you under.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\nHe\u2019s right. You don\u2019t dream.</p><p>\nYou woke up some time later, still in the position you fell asleep in\nonly with Crowley humming some melody you didn\u2019t recognise.</p><p>\n\u201cOh hello, kitten,\u201d you hear him say. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cA lot,\u201d you admit, rubbing the remnants of sleep out of your\neyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlways, my love.\u201d</p><p>\nYou look up at him, seeing the pure affection sparkling in his eyes.\nIt was quite mesmeric in a way. You reach up, taking his bristled\ncheek in your hand before kissing him softly. \n</p><p>\nIt starts out innocent but becomes something more heated very\nquickly, even though you didn\u2019t intend it to. Crowley pushes you onto your back so he can lean over you,\nhis hands gently stroking your sides. You can\u2019t help but let soft\nmoans sound out as you move into his touch. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou are sublime,\u201d he rasps out, drawing back for a second before\nhe dives back on you and you feel the warm metal of your amulet\ntickling against your skin as he fully seats himself between your\nlegs. \n</p><p>\nYou needed this, you needed him. You needed him to stake a claim so\nto speak, to feel like you were his completely. Lucifer was trying to\ntake that away from you but you wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\n\u201cYou <i>are</i> mine,\u201d Crowley catches the thought. \u201cI have\nfought so hard to show you that, to be <i>worthy</i> of that. Don\u2019t\ndoubt it now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI love you,\u201d you press your forehead to his.</p><p>\n\u201cI love you always, my kitten.\u201d</p><p>\nJust as you start kissing again, your phone rings out, the ringtone\nunfamiliar.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably important,\u201d Crowley breaks off, giving you a\nrueful smirk. \u201cPerhaps Dean\u2019s eaten Sam\u2019s chocolate protein balls\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\nYou tap him on the chest in mock chastisement before answering it.</p><p>\n\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabs?!\u201d comes Dean\u2019s voice.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you okay?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cUh no. No we\u2019re not okay. Listen, I got one phone call-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou got arrested?!\u201d your voice pitches up.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah kinda\u2026.by the FBI. We went for him, the big L I mean. He\u2019s outta the\npresident now but he knocked up the secretary. Cas has her but we\ndidn\u2019t manage to get out in time so\u2026help.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ll do what I can. Sit tight.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d comes the sarcastic reply. \u201cHurry up. Orange is\nnot my colour.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTrouble?\u201d Crowley surmises as you hang up.</p><p>\n\u201cWell Lucifer is no longer the president but he\u2019s got another girl\npregnant and Sam and Dean are in holding cells, god knows where.\nMaybe the Pentagon?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust another ordinary day, hmm?\u201d Crowley raises an eyebrow. \u201cI\nassume they need my assistance as well?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cProbably,\u201d you nod. \u201cAt least I got some rest then.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou can always come back once they\u2019re free. I admit, I was\nsceptical this could work but without my odious mother hanging around\nall the time, this is like bunking off work to have fun in the\nstorage cupboard.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcept the storage cupboard is an expensive bed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell I can make a cupboard if you really want to. Perhaps a pencil\nskirt and a blouse with a criminally low amount of buttons?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, I need to help them,\u201d you move out from under him. \u201cWe\ncan talk sexy roleplay when they\u2019re not being detained in Guantanamo\nor wherever.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that,\u201d he winks. \u201cCome on, pet. Let\u2019s save\nBeavis and Butthead.\u201d</p><p>\nYou at least had taken comfort that Lucifer was not in an almost\nunreachable vessel any more. That gave you a bit more confidence\nback. Coupled with Crowley\u2019s support and taking care of you, you were\nrefreshed in a way that you hadn\u2019t been for weeks. \n</p><p>\nMaybe all you really needed was some alone time, some bonding time\nwithout interference. There\u2019d been precious little of that lately\nwhat with all the catastrophes.</p><p>\nNow you were ready to face the world\u2026.if only you could find where\nthe hell the boys were that is\u2026.</p><p><br></p><p>____</p><p>Taglist</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIqJDwp21syOZ6QnVrKIGOw\">@astridstark13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkaWEeXj9PiJBBZ4NVr5pg\">@oldsoulevy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a></p></p>",

The little human who could bear\nme a child and live.\u201d</i></p><p><i>And\nthere was that uncharacteristically vulnerable side to him again.

Stop parading your virility like I give a\nshit.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He\nappears in front of you, hand around your throat as he squeezes, not\nhard but enough to let you know he could snap your neck with no\neffort.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Be\ncareful, Tabitha.

He only ever stayed with you until you fell\nasleep before doing day to day admin down in Hell. You wished he were\nhere with you though.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d both brothers are holding you, half perched on\nthe bed.</p><p>\n\u201cAnother devil special wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Dean guesses.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s every night,\u201d you start shaking. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s a prophet?\u201d Sam guesses. \u201cI mean\nshe\u2019s got a connection to heavenly and demonic beings right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cChuck should\u2019ve just left me alone,\u201d you try to calm your racing\nheartbeat. \u201cLucifer\u2019s the president now by the way. My dream confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGoddamnit,\u201d Dean huffs.</p><p>\nBoth brothers sit fully on your bed. You knew this was going to be a\ntough conversation ahead.</p><p>\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go after the president like this,\u201d Sam sighs. \u201cHe\u2019d\nhave to be\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026out somewhere? A visit? We have no chance\ngetting into the White House.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd Tabs can\u2019t do this with us,\u201d Dean adds.</p><p>\n\u201cDean, she\u2019s dealt with him before. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe\u2019s <i>not</i> fine!\u201d Dean gestures. \u201cShe\u2019s having freaky\ndreams every night and she\u2019s terrified, Sammy. Look at her! We need\nto start stepping up and realising she can\u2019t do this alone. We need\nto help her out and get rid of this archdouchebag.\u201d</p><p>\nYou were a tough woman but even you knew your limits. Lucifer\u2019s\nconstant attention and efforts was wearing you down and you were\nbecoming afraid. He\u2019d gotten into your head and you felt like you\ncouldn\u2019t have one moment\u2019s peace away from him.</p><p>\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this, guys,\u201d you shake your head. \u201cI can\u2019t face him\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe get it,\u201d Sam strokes your back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to push you\ninto doing anything and I think you\u2019re making a mistake hiding from\nhim but I understand why you would want to.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGive her a break,\u201d Dean scowls. \u201cYou went a little nutso when\nLucifer was stalking <i>you</i>, remember?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBecause he wanted to possess my body, Dean.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah and he wants Tabs to be his baby mama. One is more scary than\nthe other. You just had Lucifer\u2019s essence wanting to be in you rather\nthan his\u2026you know\u2026johnson.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEww,\u201d Sam wrinkles his nose.</p><p>\n\u201cRight?!\u201d Dean throws his arms out. \u201cSo give her a break.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNormally I would say something like \u2018I\u2019m right here\u2019 but you\u2019re\nright Dean,\u201d you murmur, staring at the bed covers.</p><p>\nDean looks like you\u2019ve just told him a girl covered in pizza with\nsome rare rock vinyls is waiting for him in his bedroom. His eyes\npractically glow with happiness.</p><p>\n\u201cSee that, I\u2019m right,\u201d he smiles smugly.</p><p>\n\u201cGoddamnit, Dean,\u201d Sam mutters. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll chase after\nLucifer. You stay here-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not staying here,\u201d you shake your head fervently. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to stay with Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIn Hell?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley will know some magic to help or at least be able to watch\nover me in my dreams,\u201d you explain.</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, if Lucifer smokes out of the president he can get you\nthere. He can\u2019t get here, it\u2019s warded,\u201d Sam says gently.</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, I just need\u2026.\u201d you trail off, biting your lip\nbut it doesn\u2019t stop the lump in your throat or the tears from\nstarting to form in your eyes and start tracking down your face.</p><p>\nNeither of the Winchester brothers know what to do now. You\u2019ve rarely\ncried around either of them but the stress and the disrupted sleep\nwas getting to you in a bad way.</p><p>\n\u201cOkay, do it,\u201d Dean nods solemnly. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not his\nbiggest fan but if he helps, go to him Tabs.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you manage to get out.</p><p>\nDean whips out his phone and starts dialling Crowley which you didn\u2019t\nexpect at all. In fact it was the last thing you expected.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. Well gee, don\u2019t sound so surprised,\u201d Dean makes a\nface as he walks with the phone. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Tabs. She needs you.\nShe-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Crowley asks immediately upon appearing.</p><p>\n\u201cWow, can\u2019t even get takeout delivered that fast,\u201d Dean widens\nhis eyes before shaking his head. \u201cCome on, Sammy. Let\u2019s leave them\nalone.\u201d</p><p>\nYou hear something suspiciously like 'I never knew you could be this\nmature\u2019 from Sam as they both head out, closing the door behind them.\n</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d Crowley says softly, bundling you into his\nembrace. \u201cWhy are you crying, pet?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLucifer.\u201d</p><p>\nThe grip tightens and you can hear the growl starting in his chest.</p><p>\n\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAgain,\u201d you affirm. \u201cTake me with you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHell is not a place for you, darling. We both know this. We\u2019ve\ntried it before and-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. Take me with you. I can\u2019t stand it any more. You can\nhelp me.\u201d</p><p>\nHe goes quiet for a time, rocking back and forth with you to calm you\ndown. Just being in his presence is helping you enormously.</p><p>\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he finally agrees. \u201cPack some things and say your\ngoodbyes to the Chuckle Brothers.\u201d</p><p>\nYou do so, eager to get out of the bunker. It\u2019d been so suffocating\nbeing here lately and you were glad to be leaving for a little while.</p><p>\nWhen Crowley appears in his quarters with you, you immediately drag\nhim to the big four poster bed, scrambling onto the silk sheets. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re sending me mixed signals, love,\u201d Crowley raises an\neyebrow. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI just need to be close,\u201d you tell him before taking off his\novercoat, jacket and shirt, leaving his chest bare for you to lie on.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you like this,\u201d Crowley starts petting your\nhair. \u201cYou\u2019re positively timid.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI never get any rest,\u201d you murmur. \u201cIf it\u2019s not my dreams, I\nhave these awful visions all the time. I\u2019m cracking up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Crowley leans down and kisses your forehead.\n\u201cI\u2019ll always protect you, pet. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGet some sleep. I promise you won\u2019t dream.\u201d</p><p>\nYou trust him so you just let yourself absorb the warmth from his skin,\nthe slow movements of his chest and his hand which keeps stroking\nyour hair. You feel your body just relax, all the coiled muscles just\nletting go and eventually the exhaustion pulls you under.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\nHe\u2019s right. You don\u2019t dream.</p><p>\nYou woke up some time later, still in the position you fell asleep in\nonly with Crowley humming some melody you didn\u2019t recognise.</p><p>\n\u201cOh hello, kitten,\u201d you hear him say. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cA lot,\u201d you admit, rubbing the remnants of sleep out of your\neyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlways, my love.\u201d</p><p>\nYou look up at him, seeing the pure affection sparkling in his eyes.\nIt was quite mesmeric in a way. You reach up, taking his bristled\ncheek in your hand before kissing him softly. \n</p><p>\nIt starts out innocent but becomes something more heated very\nquickly, even though you didn\u2019t intend it to. Crowley pushes you onto your back so he can lean over you,\nhis hands gently stroking your sides. You can\u2019t help but let soft\nmoans sound out as you move into his touch. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou are sublime,\u201d he rasps out, drawing back for a second before\nhe dives back on you and you feel the warm metal of your amulet\ntickling against your skin as he fully seats himself between your\nlegs. \n</p><p>\nYou needed this, you needed him. You needed him to stake a claim so\nto speak, to feel like you were his completely. Lucifer was trying to\ntake that away from you but you wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\n\u201cYou <i>are</i> mine,\u201d Crowley catches the thought. \u201cI have\nfought so hard to show you that, to be <i>worthy</i> of that. Don\u2019t\ndoubt it now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI love you,\u201d you press your forehead to his.</p><p>\n\u201cI love you always, my kitten.\u201d</p><p>\nJust as you start kissing again, your phone rings out, the ringtone\nunfamiliar.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably important,\u201d Crowley breaks off, giving you a\nrueful smirk. \u201cPerhaps Dean\u2019s eaten Sam\u2019s chocolate protein balls\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\nYou tap him on the chest in mock chastisement before answering it.</p><p>\n\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabs?!\u201d comes Dean\u2019s voice.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you okay?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cUh no. No we\u2019re not okay. Listen, I got one phone call-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou got arrested?!\u201d your voice pitches up.</p><p>\n\u201cYeah kinda\u2026.by the FBI. We went for him, the big L I mean. He\u2019s outta the\npresident now but he knocked up the secretary. Cas has her but we\ndidn\u2019t manage to get out in time so\u2026help.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ll do what I can. Sit tight.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d comes the sarcastic reply. \u201cHurry up. Orange is\nnot my colour.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTrouble?\u201d Crowley surmises as you hang up.</p><p>\n\u201cWell Lucifer is no longer the president but he\u2019s got another girl\npregnant and Sam and Dean are in holding cells, god knows where.\nMaybe the Pentagon?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust another ordinary day, hmm?\u201d Crowley raises an eyebrow. \u201cI\nassume they need my assistance as well?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cProbably,\u201d you nod. \u201cAt least I got some rest then.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou can always come back once they\u2019re free. I admit, I was\nsceptical this could work but without my odious mother hanging around\nall the time, this is like bunking off work to have fun in the\nstorage cupboard.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcept the storage cupboard is an expensive bed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell I can make a cupboard if you really want to. Perhaps a pencil\nskirt and a blouse with a criminally low amount of buttons?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, I need to help them,\u201d you move out from under him. \u201cWe\ncan talk sexy roleplay when they\u2019re not being detained in Guantanamo\nor wherever.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that,\u201d he winks. \u201cCome on, pet. Let\u2019s save\nBeavis and Butthead.\u201d</p><p>\nYou at least had taken comfort that Lucifer was not in an almost\nunreachable vessel any more. That gave you a bit more confidence\nback. Coupled with Crowley\u2019s support and taking care of you, you were\nrefreshed in a way that you hadn\u2019t been for weeks. \n</p><p>\nMaybe all you really needed was some alone time, some bonding time\nwithout interference. There\u2019d been precious little of that lately\nwhat with all the catastrophes.</p><p>\nNow you were ready to face the world\u2026.if only you could find where\nthe hell the boys were that is\u2026.</p><p><br></p><p>____</p><p>Taglist</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIqJDwp21syOZ6QnVrKIGOw\">@astridstark13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkaWEeXj9PiJBBZ4NVr5pg\">@oldsoulevy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a></p></p>",

He&rsquo;d never make you do anything sordid but if he\nwanted you to stay still, you&rsquo;d just freeze up.</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>What\ndo you want then?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>I\nwant you,&rdquo; Lucifer runs his slightly chilled fingers across your\ncheekbone and down to trace the line of your jaw. Then he tips your\nchin up so you&rsquo;re looking at him. &ldquo;This little human nobody who\nresisted my best techniques for days. The little human who&rsquo;s thwarted\nme a few times. The little human who, when I wore her boyfriend&rsquo;s\nskin, made me feel wanted and loved. The little human who could bear\nme a child and live.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>And\nthere was that uncharacteristically vulnerable side to him again. It\nalways made you uneasy with how much you felt pity for him. It made\nyou uneasy that you could rationalise his obsessive behaviour with\nthat fact that he&rsquo;d never experienced love or kindness.</i></p><p><i>His\nface is so close to yours now and you can see the lingering sadness\nin his gaze mixed with the raw need. </i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Just\nlet me have one last kiss before I go back to her,&rdquo; he pleads\nquietly.</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>No,&rdquo;\nyou reply firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not falling for your shit again. I&rsquo;m happy\nwith Crowley. I <b>love </b>Crowley.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Not\nthe answer I wanted,&rdquo; his eyes flash. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just hope Crowley\nsticks around then, huh? Would be a shame if something happened to him&hellip;if you found out something about him&hellip;.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He\nsteps back quickly, moving so rapidly it&rsquo;s like you scalded him\nbefore he morphs back into the president.</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Forgive\nme, little Tabitha., my little tabby cat. &nbsp;I have places to go, my\nlittle secretary to protect. I hope it&rsquo;s a boy, you know? I&rsquo;d like\nthat.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re\ntwisted,&rdquo; you snarl. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t threaten Crowley, <b>ever </b>and <b>never </b>try to come between us. Stop\ncoming to me in dreams. Stop parading your virility like I give a\nshit.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He\nappears in front of you, hand around your throat as he squeezes, not\nhard but enough to let you know he could snap your neck with no\neffort.</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Be\ncareful, Tabitha. I enjoy you, I enjoy your stubbornness but don&rsquo;t\never think you&rsquo;re better than me or&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You\nfelt pain. Pain was gripping your entire body and Lucifer was just\nstaring down at you with a modicum of interest.</i></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabs?!&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;d apparently started screaming in real life because the next you\nknew, Dean and Sam were in your room, trying to shake you awake. \n</p><p>\nCrowley had long gone. He only ever stayed with you until you fell\nasleep before doing day to day admin down in Hell. You wished he were\nhere with you though.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; both brothers are holding you, half perched on\nthe bed.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Another devil special wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Dean guesses.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s every night,&rdquo; you start shaking. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Why now?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s a prophet?&rdquo; Sam guesses. &ldquo;I mean\nshe&rsquo;s got a connection to heavenly and demonic beings right?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Chuck should&rsquo;ve just left me alone,&rdquo; you try to calm your racing\nheartbeat. &ldquo;Lucifer&rsquo;s the president now by the way. My dream confirmed it.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Goddamnit,&rdquo; Dean huffs.</p><p>\nBoth brothers sit fully on your bed. You knew this was going to be a\ntough conversation ahead.</p><p>\n&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go after the president like this,&rdquo; Sam sighs. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d\nhave to be&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;out somewhere? A visit? We have no chance\ngetting into the White House.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;And Tabs can&rsquo;t do this with us,&rdquo; Dean adds.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Dean, she&rsquo;s dealt with him before. She&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>not</i> fine!&rdquo; Dean gestures. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s having freaky\ndreams every night and she&rsquo;s terrified, Sammy. Look at her! We need\nto start stepping up and realising she can&rsquo;t do this alone. We need\nto help her out and get rid of this archdouchebag.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou were a tough woman but even you knew your limits. Lucifer&rsquo;s\nconstant attention and efforts was wearing you down and you were\nbecoming afraid. He&rsquo;d gotten into your head and you felt like you\ncouldn&rsquo;t have one moment&rsquo;s peace away from him.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this, guys,&rdquo; you shake your head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t face him\nagain.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;We get it,&rdquo; Sam strokes your back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to push you\ninto doing anything and I think you&rsquo;re making a mistake hiding from\nhim but I understand why you would want to.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Give her a break,&rdquo; Dean scowls. &ldquo;You went a little nutso when\nLucifer was stalking <i>you</i>, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Because he wanted to possess my body, Dean.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah and he wants Tabs to be his baby mama. One is more scary than\nthe other. You just had Lucifer&rsquo;s essence wanting to be in you rather\nthan his&hellip;you know&hellip;johnson.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Eww,&rdquo; Sam wrinkles his nose.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Right?!&rdquo; Dean throws his arms out. &ldquo;So give her a break.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Normally I would say something like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m right here&rsquo; but you&rsquo;re\nright Dean,&rdquo; you murmur, staring at the bed covers.</p><p>\nDean looks like you&rsquo;ve just told him a girl covered in pizza with\nsome rare rock vinyls is waiting for him in his bedroom. His eyes\npractically glow with happiness.</p><p>\n&ldquo;See that, I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; he smiles smugly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Goddamnit, Dean,&rdquo; Sam mutters. &ldquo;Alright, we&rsquo;ll chase after\nLucifer. You stay here-&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not staying here,&rdquo; you shake your head fervently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngoing to stay with Crowley.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;In Hell?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley will know some magic to help or at least be able to watch\nover me in my dreams,&rdquo; you explain.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabitha, if Lucifer smokes out of the president he can get you\nthere. He can&rsquo;t get here, it&rsquo;s warded,&rdquo; Sam says gently.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, I just need&hellip;.&rdquo; you trail off, biting your lip\nbut it doesn&rsquo;t stop the lump in your throat or the tears from\nstarting to form in your eyes and start tracking down your face.</p><p>\nNeither of the Winchester brothers know what to do now. You&rsquo;ve rarely\ncried around either of them but the stress and the disrupted sleep\nwas getting to you in a bad way.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Okay, do it,&rdquo; Dean nods solemnly. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not his\nbiggest fan but if he helps, go to him Tabs.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you manage to get out.</p><p>\nDean whips out his phone and starts dialling Crowley which you didn&rsquo;t\nexpect at all. In fact it was the last thing you expected.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s me. Well gee, don&rsquo;t sound so surprised,&rdquo; Dean makes a\nface as he walks with the phone. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Tabs. She needs you.\nShe-&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Crowley asks immediately upon appearing.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Wow, can&rsquo;t even get takeout delivered that fast,&rdquo; Dean widens\nhis eyes before shaking his head. &ldquo;Come on, Sammy. Let&rsquo;s leave them\nalone.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou hear something suspiciously like 'I never knew you could be this\nmature&rsquo; from Sam as they both head out, closing the door behind them.\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying,&rdquo; Crowley says softly, bundling you into his\nembrace. &ldquo;Why are you crying, pet?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Lucifer.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThe grip tightens and you can hear the growl starting in his chest.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Again?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; you affirm. &ldquo;Take me with you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hell is not a place for you, darling. We both know this. We&rsquo;ve\ntried it before and-&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Take me with you. I can&rsquo;t stand it any more. You can\nhelp me.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe goes quiet for a time, rocking back and forth with you to calm you\ndown. Just being in his presence is helping you enormously.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he finally agrees. &ldquo;Pack some things and say your\ngoodbyes to the Chuckle Brothers.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou do so, eager to get out of the bunker. It&rsquo;d been so suffocating\nbeing here lately and you were glad to be leaving for a little while.</p><p>\nWhen Crowley appears in his quarters with you, you immediately drag\nhim to the big four poster bed, scrambling onto the silk sheets. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sending me mixed signals, love,&rdquo; Crowley raises an\neyebrow. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I just need to be close,&rdquo; you tell him before taking off his\novercoat, jacket and shirt, leaving his chest bare for you to lie on.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you like this,&rdquo; Crowley starts petting your\nhair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re positively timid.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I never get any rest,&rdquo; you murmur. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not my dreams, I\nhave these awful visions all the time. I&rsquo;m cracking up.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; Crowley leans down and kisses your forehead.\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always protect you, pet. You know that, right?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Get some sleep. I promise you won&rsquo;t dream.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou trust him so you just let yourself absorb the warmth from his skin,\nthe slow movements of his chest and his hand which keeps stroking\nyour hair. You feel your body just relax, all the coiled muscles just\nletting go and eventually the exhaustion pulls you under.</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\nHe&rsquo;s right. You don&rsquo;t dream.</p><p>\nYou woke up some time later, still in the position you fell asleep in\nonly with Crowley humming some melody you didn&rsquo;t recognise.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh hello, kitten,&rdquo; you hear him say. &ldquo;Feel better?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;A lot,&rdquo; you admit, rubbing the remnants of sleep out of your\neyes. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Always, my love.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou look up at him, seeing the pure affection sparkling in his eyes.\nIt was quite mesmeric in a way. You reach up, taking his bristled\ncheek in your hand before kissing him softly. \n</p><p>\nIt starts out innocent but becomes something more heated very\nquickly, even though you didn&rsquo;t intend it to. Crowley pushes you onto your back so he can lean over you,\nhis hands gently stroking your sides. You can&rsquo;t help but let soft\nmoans sound out as you move into his touch. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;You are sublime,&rdquo; he rasps out, drawing back for a second before\nhe dives back on you and you feel the warm metal of your amulet\ntickling against your skin as he fully seats himself between your\nlegs. \n</p><p>\nYou needed this, you needed him. You needed him to stake a claim so\nto speak, to feel like you were his completely. Lucifer was trying to\ntake that away from you but you wouldn&rsquo;t let him.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You <i>are</i> mine,&rdquo; Crowley catches the thought. &ldquo;I have\nfought so hard to show you that, to be <i>worthy</i> of that. Don&rsquo;t\ndoubt it now.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you press your forehead to his.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I love you always, my kitten.&rdquo;</p><p>\nJust as you start kissing again, your phone rings out, the ringtone\nunfamiliar.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably important,&rdquo; Crowley breaks off, giving you a\nrueful smirk. &ldquo;Perhaps Dean&rsquo;s eaten Sam&rsquo;s chocolate protein balls\nagain.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou tap him on the chest in mock chastisement before answering it.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabs?!&rdquo; comes Dean&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Are you okay?!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Uh no. No we&rsquo;re not okay. Listen, I got one phone call-&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You got arrested?!&rdquo; your voice pitches up.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah kinda&hellip;.by the FBI. We went for him, the big L I mean. He&rsquo;s outta the\npresident now but he knocked up the secretary. Cas has her but we\ndidn&rsquo;t manage to get out in time so&hellip;help.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. I&rsquo;ll do what I can. Sit tight.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute,&rdquo; comes the sarcastic reply. &ldquo;Hurry up. Orange is\nnot my colour.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; Crowley surmises as you hang up.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well Lucifer is no longer the president but he&rsquo;s got another girl\npregnant and Sam and Dean are in holding cells, god knows where.\nMaybe the Pentagon?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Just another ordinary day, hmm?&rdquo; Crowley raises an eyebrow. &ldquo;I\nassume they need my assistance as well?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; you nod. &ldquo;At least I got some rest then.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You can always come back once they&rsquo;re free. I admit, I was\nsceptical this could work but without my odious mother hanging around\nall the time, this is like bunking off work to have fun in the\nstorage cupboard.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Except the storage cupboard is an expensive bed.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well I can make a cupboard if you really want to. Perhaps a pencil\nskirt and a blouse with a criminally low amount of buttons?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley, I need to help them,&rdquo; you move out from under him. &ldquo;We\ncan talk sexy roleplay when they&rsquo;re not being detained in Guantanamo\nor wherever.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding you to that,&rdquo; he winks. &ldquo;Come on, pet. Let&rsquo;s save\nBeavis and Butthead.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou at least had taken comfort that Lucifer was not in an almost\nunreachable vessel any more. That gave you a bit more confidence\nback. Coupled with Crowley&rsquo;s support and taking care of you, you were\nrefreshed in a way that you hadn&rsquo;t been for weeks. \n</p><p>\nMaybe all you really needed was some alone time, some bonding time\nwithout interference. There&rsquo;d been precious little of that lately\nwhat with all the catastrophes.</p><p>\nNow you were ready to face the world&hellip;.if only you could find where\nthe hell the boys were that is&hellip;.</p><p><br /></p><p>____</p><p>Taglist</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIqJDwp21syOZ6QnVrKIGOw\">@astridstark13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkaWEeXj9PiJBBZ4NVr5pg\">@oldsoulevy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a></p></p>",

Four and a half hours of music.
