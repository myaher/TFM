We do not need them as enemies, and now all the court knows you can be defied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe mocked me.\u201d Joffrey\u2019s lips twist. \u201cI should\u2019ve taken her head for it and sent that back north instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a fool thing to do. Do you want to be known as the second coming of mad king Aerys?\u201d Twin tilts his head to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re a vain, callow child, and we are blessed by the seven that the realm at large does not know it. Do not tempt them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t speak to me like that,\u201d Joffrey\u2019s face purples, and for a moment his head seems to swell like a bladder about to burst. \u201cI am the king. The king! Do you understand? My word is law. You\u2019re just a toothless, doddering old man. So long as you wear that chain you\u2019re my Hand, and you\u2019ll wipe my shit if I tell you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say, your grace,\u201d Tywin answers, and the chill in his voice cuts to the bone. \u201cBut I wear that chain no longer.\u201d</p><p>Joffrey sputters as Twyin reaches up and lifts the chain of interlocking hands around his neck, drops it to the table with a clatter. He leaves the hall as Joffrey finds his voice and screams at him to return or lose his head.</p><!-- more --><p>The news of Tywin\u2019s departure spreads through King\u2019s Landing like wildfire. If before the whispers of Joffrey\u2019s cruelty were faint, now they are an ever present buzz through the halls of the Red Keep. To Jon it means little. His days are still spent standing silent behind Joffrey watching as he sits the iron throne and makes a mockery of being king, his only joy taken when one of the throne\u2019s hundred blades cuts Joffrey, leaves a thin red line across his arm or hand or leg.</p><hr><p>As half brother to the queen Barristan gives Jon the duty of standing guard over Sansa much of the time. Often she is in the company of the lords and ladies of court, the gracious and graceful lady she was born to be, and Jon begins to notice things he never had before: the compliments she gives to even the lowest ladies, the tilt of her head to show those who are speaking she is listening, the way she can draw a smile from even the most taciturn lord.</p><p>Foolish, Jon has always thought the gossip of court, but standing silent behind Sansa he learns of how fat Lolly\u2019s mother was desperate for her to find a husband, how the ebon skinned Jalabhar Xho thought he\u2019d finally found an ally in the Tyrells to help him win back the Summer Isles, how lady Taena thought her husband a fool but would do anything for her son, how the Kettleblacks spoke only to those who could make it worth their while, how tall lord Blackwood was hoping the king would rule in his favor in his feud with the Brackens.</p><p>\u201cHow do you remember it all?\u201d Jon asks one day when it is only the two of them in her chambers, Sansa sitting beside the window sowing and he leaning against the wall beside the door. \u201cIt makes my head hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA knight has his battlefield, a lady hers.\u201d Sansa shrugs as she draws tight the thread of the needle between her fingers. \u201cMother used to tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Jon chews her words. Was it so different from being a bastard, in a way? As a child he\u2019d learned to always be watchful of others: to know when Catelyn was close, when lords were visiting Winterfell, when to slink away so he didn\u2019t embarrass his lord father, to say<i> Lord Stark</i> in place of <i>father</i>.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever wonder what it would\u2019ve been like?\u201d Sansa says, and Jon looks to find her gazing out the window, breeze playing with the red strays of her hair. \u201cIf we never left Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>Jon is silent a long moment. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he admits eventually. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone to the Wall. I\u2019d planned to before Bran fell, but father forbade it.\u201d</p><p>A frown creases Sansa\u2019s brow, and she glances up at him. \u201cI never knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only ever told father and uncle Benjen. And Arya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would truly have given up taking a wife or inheriting lands even then?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiles faintly, the expression tinged with bitterness. \u201cWhat lands? A bastard has no lands to inherit, no more than he has a home to call his own.\u201d</p><p>Sansa draws back as if stung. \u201cAnd Winterfell?\u201d Her voice is hot. \u201cHow can you not think of it as home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Winterfell.\u201d The words hurt to say, even here, even now. \u201cBut no bastard is ever truly welcome among his father\u2019s trueborn family. Your lady mother never let me forget that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa blinks and looks away, out to the window. For a moment she looks so like a maiden from a song waiting in her tower for some brave knight to come save her that it cuts Jon to the bone. \u201cAnd you?\u201d He asks to take some of the sting from his words. \u201cWhat would you have done if we never left Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried some lord.\u201d Sansa laughs, but it is a wistful sound. \u201cA fat old man, no doubt, but I would\u2019ve been a dutiful wife and born him a half dozen strong sons all the same.\u201d</p><p>Jon shakes his head. He forces his voice light. \u201cNo, you would have married some tall handsome lord. Father would never have made you marry someone you hated for duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t need to.\u201d Sansa looks away from the window, eyes seeking out his, so sharp and pressing and blue that Jon wonders how he could\u2019ve ever found them distant. \u201cYou are a Stark, Jon,\u201d she says softly, \u201cor you would not wear that cloak.\u201d</p><hr><p>The first time Joffrey strikes Sansa the bruise mottles the side of her collarbone round as the pit of a peach, a day old by the time Jon sees it. He frowns when he does, the crease of his forehead deepening as Sansa glances at him, then away. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asks.</p><p>Sansa refuses to meet his gaze. Her hands fiddle with a piece of embroidery, turning the silk between her fingers. \u201cI displeased His Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoffrey did this?\u201d</p><p>Still Sansa refuses to meet his gaze, but she is a Stark and lying has never been their way. \u201cI made him wroth.\u201d</p><p>The words fill Jon white hot. He is across the room in a heartbeat, kneeling before where she sits and unsheathing his sword with a long low rasp steel. \u201cAsk,\u201d he says, voice cool, \u201cask and Joffrey dies. Today. This very hour. Ask and I will do it, I swear it by the old gods and the new.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s eyes meet his for a moment, trapped and distant, and then she is looking to her embroidery again. \u201cAnd have you tortured and killed?\u201d Her voice is soft. \u201cHe is the king, Jon. You know that well as I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Sansa tilts her head to the side, only the tremble of her fingers as she takes up her needle and begins again her embroidery betraying the forced lightness of her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll be more careful, that\u2019s all. I will. He won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Jon clenches his jaw till it aches, but all he can do is stand and shove his sword back in its scabbard. \u201cIf he does it again I\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he says, but even to him the words ring weak. <i>You swore a vow. </i>But which? To protect the weak? To serve the king?</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Sansa finally looks up at him. She forces a smile that doesn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cHe was only wroth.\u201d</p><hr><p>Jon refuses to leave Sansa\u2019s side after that. Everywhere she goes he follows, a white shadow always a few steps behind her as she sews with her ladies in waiting or sits beside the king at feasts and court or kneels before the heart tree in the godswood. Even at night Jon stands before her chamber door, a white and silent sentinel.</p><p>But it is impossible to deny Joffrey his marriage rights, not unless Jon is willing to spill blood. And so though Joffrey only visits Sansa a few times each moon, Jon stands rigid during each listening to the murmur of Sansa\u2019s voice, the bark of Joffrey\u2019s; tries to ignore the creak of the bed and Joffrey\u2019s grunts, ears straining for the sound of a fist striking flesh. It never comes, but the waiting leaves Jon so ragged by morning that he moves in a half stupor the rest of the day.</p><hr><p>The second time Joffrey strikes Sansa Jon is again not there to see it, having risen late from exhaustion. Sansa\u2019s eyes meet Jon\u2019s as he enters her chamber, and Jon knows instantly what\u2019s happened even before he glimpses the freshly risen purple-blue circle along her jaw.</p><p>\u201cJon-\u201d she begins, but Jon is already turning on his heel, striding back through the halls of the Red Keep as she calls for him to come back, a dull pounding in his ears.</p><p>Barristan is with Jamie Lannister in the White Tower of the Kingsguard. Both men look up as Jon sweeps into the room. \u201cJoffrey struck her again,\u201d he says without waiting, gaze flat on Barristan as he ignores the Kingslayer beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s there on her jaw, a bruise plain as day.\u201d</p><p>Barristan puts down the quill he was holding and glances at Jaimie in dismissal, but the Kingslayer merely smiles and leans against the chamber wall. Barristan turns his gaze to Jon. \u201cHe was wroth. His grace has been much\u2026 unsettled since Tywin gave up the handship. There are rumors of a dragon queen ruling the slave cities of the east, and the Iron Bank of Braavos is refusing to extend the crown\u2019s debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could be refusing to fuck the queen mother and I wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d Distantly, Jon knows he should pick his words with more care, but there is a well of rage in him that makes him want to grab the old knight and rattle him in his fine white armor until he understands. \u201cHe <i>struck</i> her, Selmy. Does that not mean anything to you as a knight? To the vows you took?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my vows.\u201d Barristan says sharply. He takes a seat at the head of the table upon which the white tome of the kingsguard sits silent and heavy. \u201cWe swore to guard the king, Jon, not judge him.\u201d He sighs and shakes his head. \u201cBut I will do what I can to see that Sansa is kept distant from his grace until his temper cools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil his temper <i>cools?</i>\u201d Jon whirls on his heel for the door. If he does not leave now the rage throbbing through him will consume him, have him draw his sword and then there will be no undoing what comes next. \u201cIf he strikes her again Joffrey will see just how sharp a cool temper can be. That I swear to you, Selmy.\u201d</p><p>Hundreds of steps the White Tower has, but Jon does not remember his feet touching a one as he emerges from the cool of the tower into the morning sun of the yard and stands there shaking with rage, hand gripping the hilt of the sword at his side. His fingers itch to draw it, to lash out, but there is nothing to strike but the old stone of the tower, all his hours in the practice yard useless here.</p><p>Jon does not know how long he stands like that, but soon the sound of footsteps echo behind him. He doesn\u2019t turn as Jaime Lannister ducks out from the tower. \u201cYou should take more care with your words, Snow.\u201d Jaime tilts his head up at the tower. \u201cSome might not take as lightly as Selmy a threat against his grace\u2019s person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Lannister?\u201d Jon clenches his jaw. \u201cJoffrey is your blood. Do you not have any shame for what he\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>Jaime shrugs and leans back against the tower wall. \u201cHe\u2019s within his royal rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyal rights?\u201d Jon spits at the ground. \u201cAny king that strikes a woman does not deserve the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have unseated Robert, and Aerys before him, then?\u201d Jaimie smiles as Jon turns to him with a scowl. \u201cThree kings I\u2019ve served, Snow, and each did the same when wroth or in his cups. Did you never wonder why my sister was absent from court for weeks at a time? Weeks is what it takes for a bruise to fade, though Robert usually took care not to strike her where it could be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie.\u201d Jon\u2019s hand clenches around the hilt of his sword. \u201cMy father would never have allowed such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllowed?\u201d Jaime laughs, high and scornful. \u201cYour father saw it and never raised a hand. And if noble lord Stark with his precious honor would not stop a king who am I to do different? Why should I protect his blood when he would not do the same for mine? No, bastard, I care nothing if Joffrey strikes your sister. And do not think Selmy will either. Do you know what mad king Aerys did to queen Elia, the way she would plead and shriek while Barristan stood guarding the door in his fine white cloak? They say I have shit for honor because I slew the Mad King, but all through the realm Barristan is loved for having stood silent.\u201d</p><p>Jon can do no more than stand just as silent, fists clenched, as Jaimie leaves the wall and walks away across the yard, white cloak swirling behind him.</p>",

He leaves the hall as Joffrey finds his voice and screams at him to return or lose his head.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The news of Tywin\u2019s departure spreads through King\u2019s Landing like wildfire. If before the whispers of Joffrey\u2019s cruelty were faint, now they are an ever present buzz through the halls of the Red Keep. To Jon it means little. His days are still spent standing silent behind Joffrey watching as he sits the iron throne and makes a mockery of being king, his only joy taken when one of the throne\u2019s hundred blades cuts Joffrey, leaves a thin red line across his arm or hand or leg.</p><hr><p>As half brother to the queen Barristan gives Jon the duty of standing guard over Sansa much of the time. Often she is in the company of the lords and ladies of court, the gracious and graceful lady she was born to be, and Jon begins to notice things he never had before: the compliments she gives to even the lowest ladies, the tilt of her head to show those who are speaking she is listening, the way she can draw a smile from even the most taciturn lord.</p><p>Foolish, Jon has always thought the gossip of court, but standing silent behind Sansa he learns of how fat Lolly\u2019s mother was desperate for her to find a husband, how the ebon skinned Jalabhar Xho thought he\u2019d finally found an ally in the Tyrells to help him win back the Summer Isles, how lady Taena thought her husband a fool but would do anything for her son, how the Kettleblacks spoke only to those who could make it worth their while, how tall lord Blackwood was hoping the king would rule in his favor in his feud with the Brackens.</p><p>\u201cHow do you remember it all?\u201d Jon asks one day when it is only the two of them in her chambers, Sansa sitting beside the window sowing and he leaning against the wall beside the door. \u201cIt makes my head hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA knight has his battlefield, a lady hers.\u201d Sansa shrugs as she draws tight the thread of the needle between her fingers. \u201cMother used to tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Jon chews her words.

Did you never wonder why my sister was absent from court for weeks at a time? Weeks is what it takes for a bruise to fade, though Robert usually took care not to strike her where it could be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie.\u201d Jon\u2019s hand clenches around the hilt of his sword. \u201cMy father would never have allowed such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllowed?\u201d Jaime laughs, high and scornful. \u201cYour father saw it and never raised a hand. And if noble lord Stark with his precious honor would not stop a king who am I to do different? Why should I protect his blood when he would not do the same for mine? No, bastard, I care nothing if Joffrey strikes your sister. And do not think Selmy will either. Do you know what mad king Aerys did to queen Elia, the way she would plead and shriek while Barristan stood guarding the door in his fine white cloak? They say I have shit for honor because I slew the Mad King, but all through the realm Barristan is loved for having stood silent.\u201d</p><p>Jon can do no more than stand just as silent, fists clenched, as Jaimie leaves the wall and walks away across the yard, white cloak swirling behind him.</p></p>",

If before the whispers of Joffrey\u2019s cruelty were faint, now they are an ever present buzz through the halls of the Red Keep. To Jon it means little. His days are still spent standing silent behind Joffrey watching as he sits the iron throne and makes a mockery of being king, his only joy taken when one of the throne\u2019s hundred blades cuts Joffrey, leaves a thin red line across his arm or hand or leg.</p><hr><p>As half brother to the queen Barristan gives Jon the duty of standing guard over Sansa much of the time. Often she is in the company of the lords and ladies of court, the gracious and graceful lady she was born to be, and Jon begins to notice things he never had before: the compliments she gives to even the lowest ladies, the tilt of her head to show those who are speaking she is listening, the way she can draw a smile from even the most taciturn lord.</p><p>Foolish, Jon has always thought the gossip of court, but standing silent behind Sansa he learns of how fat Lolly\u2019s mother was desperate for her to find a husband, how the ebon skinned Jalabhar Xho thought he\u2019d finally found an ally in the Tyrells to help him win back the Summer Isles, how lady Taena thought her husband a fool but would do anything for her son, how the Kettleblacks spoke only to those who could make it worth their while, how tall lord Blackwood was hoping the king would rule in his favor in his feud with the Brackens.</p><p>\u201cHow do you remember it all?\u201d Jon asks one day when it is only the two of them in her chambers, Sansa sitting beside the window sowing and he leaning against the wall beside the door. \u201cIt makes my head hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA knight has his battlefield, a lady hers.\u201d Sansa shrugs as she draws tight the thread of the needle between her fingers. \u201cMother used to tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Jon chews her words. Was it so different from being a bastard, in a way? As a child he\u2019d learned to always be watchful of others: to know when Catelyn was close, when lords were visiting Winterfell, when to slink away so he didn\u2019t embarrass his lord father, to say<i> Lord Stark</i> in place of <i>father</i>.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever wonder what it would\u2019ve been like?\u201d Sansa says, and Jon looks to find her gazing out the window, breeze playing with the red strays of her hair. \u201cIf we never left Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>Jon is silent a long moment. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he admits eventually. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone to the Wall. I\u2019d planned to before Bran fell, but father forbade it.\u201d</p><p>A frown creases Sansa\u2019s brow, and she glances up at him. \u201cI never knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only ever told father and uncle Benjen. And Arya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would truly have given up taking a wife or inheriting lands even then?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiles faintly, the expression tinged with bitterness. \u201cWhat lands? A bastard has no lands to inherit, no more than he has a home to call his own.\u201d</p><p>Sansa draws back as if stung. \u201cAnd Winterfell?\u201d Her voice is hot. \u201cHow can you not think of it as home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Winterfell.\u201d The words hurt to say, even here, even now. \u201cBut no bastard is ever truly welcome among his father\u2019s trueborn family. Your lady mother never let me forget that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa blinks and looks away, out to the window. For a moment she looks so like a maiden from a song waiting in her tower for some brave knight to come save her that it cuts Jon to the bone. \u201cAnd you?\u201d He asks to take some of the sting from his words. \u201cWhat would you have done if we never left Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried some lord.\u201d Sansa laughs, but it is a wistful sound. \u201cA fat old man, no doubt, but I would\u2019ve been a dutiful wife and born him a half dozen strong sons all the same.\u201d</p><p>Jon shakes his head. He forces his voice light. \u201cNo, you would have married some tall handsome lord. Father would never have made you marry someone you hated for duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t need to.\u201d Sansa looks away from the window, eyes seeking out his, so sharp and pressing and blue that Jon wonders how he could\u2019ve ever found them distant. \u201cYou are a Stark, Jon,\u201d she says softly, \u201cor you would not wear that cloak.\u201d</p><hr><p>The first time Joffrey strikes Sansa the bruise mottles the side of her collarbone round as the pit of a peach, a day old by the time Jon sees it. He frowns when he does, the crease of his forehead deepening as Sansa glances at him, then away. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asks.</p><p>Sansa refuses to meet his gaze. Her hands fiddle with a piece of embroidery, turning the silk between her fingers. \u201cI displeased His Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoffrey did this?\u201d</p><p>Still Sansa refuses to meet his gaze, but she is a Stark and lying has never been their way. \u201cI made him wroth.\u201d</p><p>The words fill Jon white hot. He is across the room in a heartbeat, kneeling before where she sits and unsheathing his sword with a long low rasp steel. \u201cAsk,\u201d he says, voice cool, \u201cask and Joffrey dies. Today. This very hour. Ask and I will do it, I swear it by the old gods and the new.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s eyes meet his for a moment, trapped and distant, and then she is looking to her embroidery again. \u201cAnd have you tortured and killed?\u201d Her voice is soft. \u201cHe is the king, Jon. You know that well as I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Sansa tilts her head to the side, only the tremble of her fingers as she takes up her needle and begins again her embroidery betraying the forced lightness of her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll be more careful, that\u2019s all. I will. He won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Jon clenches his jaw till it aches, but all he can do is stand and shove his sword back in its scabbard. \u201cIf he does it again I\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he says, but even to him the words ring weak. <i>You swore a vow. </i>But which? To protect the weak? To serve the king?</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Sansa finally looks up at him. She forces a smile that doesn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cHe was only wroth.\u201d</p><hr><p>Jon refuses to leave Sansa\u2019s side after that. Everywhere she goes he follows, a white shadow always a few steps behind her as she sews with her ladies in waiting or sits beside the king at feasts and court or kneels before the heart tree in the godswood. Even at night Jon stands before her chamber door, a white and silent sentinel.</p><p>But it is impossible to deny Joffrey his marriage rights, not unless Jon is willing to spill blood. And so though Joffrey only visits Sansa a few times each moon, Jon stands rigid during each listening to the murmur of Sansa\u2019s voice, the bark of Joffrey\u2019s; tries to ignore the creak of the bed and Joffrey\u2019s grunts, ears straining for the sound of a fist striking flesh. It never comes, but the waiting leaves Jon so ragged by morning that he moves in a half stupor the rest of the day.</p><hr><p>The second time Joffrey strikes Sansa Jon is again not there to see it, having risen late from exhaustion. Sansa\u2019s eyes meet Jon\u2019s as he enters her chamber, and Jon knows instantly what\u2019s happened even before he glimpses the freshly risen purple-blue circle along her jaw.</p><p>\u201cJon-\u201d she begins, but Jon is already turning on his heel, striding back through the halls of the Red Keep as she calls for him to come back, a dull pounding in his ears.</p><p>Barristan is with Jamie Lannister in the White Tower of the Kingsguard. Both men look up as Jon sweeps into the room. \u201cJoffrey struck her again,\u201d he says without waiting, gaze flat on Barristan as he ignores the Kingslayer beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s there on her jaw, a bruise plain as day.\u201d</p><p>Barristan puts down the quill he was holding and glances at Jaimie in dismissal, but the Kingslayer merely smiles and leans against the chamber wall. Barristan turns his gaze to Jon. \u201cHe was wroth. His grace has been much\u2026 unsettled since Tywin gave up the handship. There are rumors of a dragon queen ruling the slave cities of the east, and the Iron Bank of Braavos is refusing to extend the crown\u2019s debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could be refusing to fuck the queen mother and I wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d Distantly, Jon knows he should pick his words with more care, but there is a well of rage in him that makes him want to grab the old knight and rattle him in his fine white armor until he understands. \u201cHe <i>struck</i> her, Selmy. Does that not mean anything to you as a knight? To the vows you took?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my vows.\u201d Barristan says sharply. He takes a seat at the head of the table upon which the white tome of the kingsguard sits silent and heavy. \u201cWe swore to guard the king, Jon, not judge him.\u201d He sighs and shakes his head. \u201cBut I will do what I can to see that Sansa is kept distant from his grace until his temper cools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil his temper <i>cools?</i>\u201d Jon whirls on his heel for the door. If he does not leave now the rage throbbing through him will consume him, have him draw his sword and then there will be no undoing what comes next. \u201cIf he strikes her again Joffrey will see just how sharp a cool temper can be. That I swear to you, Selmy.\u201d</p><p>Hundreds of steps the White Tower has, but Jon does not remember his feet touching a one as he emerges from the cool of the tower into the morning sun of the yard and stands there shaking with rage, hand gripping the hilt of the sword at his side. His fingers itch to draw it, to lash out, but there is nothing to strike but the old stone of the tower, all his hours in the practice yard useless here.</p><p>Jon does not know how long he stands like that, but soon the sound of footsteps echo behind him. He doesn\u2019t turn as Jaime Lannister ducks out from the tower. \u201cYou should take more care with your words, Snow.\u201d Jaime tilts his head up at the tower. \u201cSome might not take as lightly as Selmy a threat against his grace\u2019s person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Lannister?\u201d Jon clenches his jaw. \u201cJoffrey is your blood. Do you not have any shame for what he\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>Jaime shrugs and leans back against the tower wall. \u201cHe\u2019s within his royal rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyal rights?\u201d Jon spits at the ground. \u201cAny king that strikes a woman does not deserve the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have unseated Robert, and Aerys before him, then?\u201d Jaimie smiles as Jon turns to him with a scowl. \u201cThree kings I\u2019ve served, Snow, and each did the same when wroth or in his cups. Did you never wonder why my sister was absent from court for weeks at a time? Weeks is what it takes for a bruise to fade, though Robert usually took care not to strike her where it could be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie.\u201d Jon\u2019s hand clenches around the hilt of his sword. \u201cMy father would never have allowed such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllowed?\u201d Jaime laughs, high and scornful. \u201cYour father saw it and never raised a hand. And if noble lord Stark with his precious honor would not stop a king who am I to do different? Why should I protect his blood when he would not do the same for mine? No, bastard, I care nothing if Joffrey strikes your sister. And do not think Selmy will either. Do you know what mad king Aerys did to queen Elia, the way she would plead and shriek while Barristan stood guarding the door in his fine white cloak? They say I have shit for honor because I slew the Mad King, but all through the realm Barristan is loved for having stood silent.\u201d</p><p>Jon can do no more than stand just as silent, fists clenched, as Jaimie leaves the wall and walks away across the yard, white cloak swirling behind him.</p></p>",

Father would never have made you marry someone you hated for duty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t need to.&rdquo; Sansa looks away from the window, eyes seeking out his, so sharp and pressing and blue that Jon wonders how he could&rsquo;ve ever found them distant. &ldquo;You are a Stark, Jon,&rdquo; she says softly, &ldquo;or you would not wear that cloak.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>The first time Joffrey strikes Sansa the bruise mottles the side of her collarbone round as the pit of a peach, a day old by the time Jon sees it. He frowns when he does, the crease of his forehead deepening as Sansa glances at him, then away. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>Sansa refuses to meet his gaze. Her hands fiddle with a piece of embroidery, turning the silk between her fingers. &ldquo;I displeased His Grace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Joffrey did this?&rdquo;</p><p>Still Sansa refuses to meet his gaze, but she is a Stark and lying has never been their way. &ldquo;I made him wroth.&rdquo;</p><p>The words fill Jon white hot. He is across the room in a heartbeat, kneeling before where she sits and unsheathing his sword with a long low rasp steel. &ldquo;Ask,&rdquo; he says, voice cool, &ldquo;ask and Joffrey dies. Today. This very hour. Ask and I will do it, I swear it by the old gods and the new.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s eyes meet his for a moment, trapped and distant, and then she is looking to her embroidery again. &ldquo;And have you tortured and killed?&rdquo; Her voice is soft. &ldquo;He is the king, Jon. You know that well as I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; Sansa tilts her head to the side, only the tremble of her fingers as she takes up her needle and begins again her embroidery betraying the forced lightness of her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more careful, that&rsquo;s all. I will. He won&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon clenches his jaw till it aches, but all he can do is stand and shove his sword back in its scabbard. &ldquo;If he does it again I&rsquo;ll kill him,&rdquo; he says, but even to him the words ring weak. <i>You swore a vow. </i>But which? To protect the weak? To serve the king?</p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sansa finally looks up at him. She forces a smile that doesn&rsquo;t reach her eyes. &ldquo;He was only wroth.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Jon refuses to leave Sansa&rsquo;s side after that. Everywhere she goes he follows, a white shadow always a few steps behind her as she sews with her ladies in waiting or sits beside the king at feasts and court or kneels before the heart tree in the godswood. Even at night Jon stands before her chamber door, a white and silent sentinel.</p><p>But it is impossible to deny Joffrey his marriage rights, not unless Jon is willing to spill blood. And so though Joffrey only visits Sansa a few times each moon, Jon stands rigid during each listening to the murmur of Sansa&rsquo;s voice, the bark of Joffrey&rsquo;s; tries to ignore the creak of the bed and Joffrey&rsquo;s grunts, ears straining for the sound of a fist striking flesh. It never comes, but the waiting leaves Jon so ragged by morning that he moves in a half stupor the rest of the day.</p><hr /><p>The second time Joffrey strikes Sansa Jon is again not there to see it, having risen late from exhaustion. Sansa&rsquo;s eyes meet Jon&rsquo;s as he enters her chamber, and Jon knows instantly what&rsquo;s happened even before he glimpses the freshly risen purple-blue circle along her jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon-&rdquo; she begins, but Jon is already turning on his heel, striding back through the halls of the Red Keep as she calls for him to come back, a dull pounding in his ears.</p><p>Barristan is with Jamie Lannister in the White Tower of the Kingsguard. Both men look up as Jon sweeps into the room. &ldquo;Joffrey struck her again,&rdquo; he says without waiting, gaze flat on Barristan as he ignores the Kingslayer beside him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s there on her jaw, a bruise plain as day.&rdquo;</p><p>Barristan puts down the quill he was holding and glances at Jaimie in dismissal, but the Kingslayer merely smiles and leans against the chamber wall. Barristan turns his gaze to Jon. &ldquo;He was wroth. His grace has been much&hellip; unsettled since Tywin gave up the handship. There are rumors of a dragon queen ruling the slave cities of the east, and the Iron Bank of Braavos is refusing to extend the crown&rsquo;s debt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They could be refusing to fuck the queen mother and I wouldn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Distantly, Jon knows he should pick his words with more care, but there is a well of rage in him that makes him want to grab the old knight and rattle him in his fine white armor until he understands. &ldquo;He <i>struck</i> her, Selmy. Does that not mean anything to you as a knight? To the vows you took?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know my vows.&rdquo; Barristan says sharply. He takes a seat at the head of the table upon which the white tome of the kingsguard sits silent and heavy. &ldquo;We swore to guard the king, Jon, not judge him.&rdquo; He sighs and shakes his head. &ldquo;But I will do what I can to see that Sansa is kept distant from his grace until his temper cools.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Until his temper <i>cools?</i>&rdquo; Jon whirls on his heel for the door. If he does not leave now the rage throbbing through him will consume him, have him draw his sword and then there will be no undoing what comes next. &ldquo;If he strikes her again Joffrey will see just how sharp a cool temper can be. That I swear to you, Selmy.&rdquo;</p><p>Hundreds of steps the White Tower has, but Jon does not remember his feet touching a one as he emerges from the cool of the tower into the morning sun of the yard and stands there shaking with rage, hand gripping the hilt of the sword at his side. His fingers itch to draw it, to lash out, but there is nothing to strike but the old stone of the tower, all his hours in the practice yard useless here.</p><p>Jon does not know how long he stands like that, but soon the sound of footsteps echo behind him. He doesn&rsquo;t turn as Jaime Lannister ducks out from the tower. &ldquo;You should take more care with your words, Snow.&rdquo; Jaime tilts his head up at the tower. &ldquo;Some might not take as lightly as Selmy a threat against his grace&rsquo;s person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you, Lannister?&rdquo; Jon clenches his jaw. &ldquo;Joffrey is your blood. Do you not have any shame for what he&rsquo;s done?&rdquo;</p><p>Jaime shrugs and leans back against the tower wall. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s within his royal rights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Royal rights?&rdquo; Jon spits at the ground. &ldquo;Any king that strikes a woman does not deserve the name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You would have unseated Robert, and Aerys before him, then?&rdquo; Jaimie smiles as Jon turns to him with a scowl. &ldquo;Three kings I&rsquo;ve served, Snow, and each did the same when wroth or in his cups. Did you never wonder why my sister was absent from court for weeks at a time? Weeks is what it takes for a bruise to fade, though Robert usually took care not to strike her where it could be seen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You lie.&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s hand clenches around the hilt of his sword. &ldquo;My father would never have allowed such a thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Allowed?&rdquo; Jaime laughs, high and scornful. &ldquo;Your father saw it and never raised a hand. And if noble lord Stark with his precious honor would not stop a king who am I to do different? Why should I protect his blood when he would not do the same for mine? No, bastard, I care nothing if Joffrey strikes your sister. And do not think Selmy will either. Do you know what mad king Aerys did to queen Elia, the way she would plead and shriek while Barristan stood guarding the door in his fine white cloak? They say I have shit for honor because I slew the Mad King, but all through the realm Barristan is loved for having stood silent.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon can do no more than stand just as silent, fists clenched, as Jaimie leaves the wall and walks away across the yard, white cloak swirling behind him.</p></p>",

So long as you wear that chain you&rsquo;re my Hand, and you&rsquo;ll wipe my shit if I tell you to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As you say, your grace,&rdquo; Tywin answers, and the chill in his voice cuts to the bone. &ldquo;But I wear that chain no longer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Joffrey sputters as Twyin reaches up and lifts the chain of interlocking hands around his neck, drops it to the table with a clatter. He leaves the hall as Joffrey finds his voice and screams at him to return or lose his head.</p>\n</p>",

NOTE: This blog is Gendarya, Team Dragonstone-friendly. This blog is NOT J*nsa-friendly or supportive of Jon or Dany's past romantic pairings. I don't actively hate on them on here in public.
