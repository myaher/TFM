ignoring all the activities around him. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t that he wanted to be here, but the\ntruth was, he needed a place to think and have a drink, something that the\nthrone room wasn\u2019t going to provide, especially once his demons realised he was\nthere.</p><p>He watched the golden liquid shift in his glass, catching in\nthe small amounts of light that reached him, and while he knew he was\nprocrastinating his own thoughts, he felt calmer than what he had in days.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like being like this, didn\u2019t like having things\nout of his control, and the worse thing about it all, he didn\u2019t have anyone\nthat he would dare even mention it too.</p><!-- more --><p>The door to the bar opened and for the first time since he\nsat down, he found his gaze wandering up. \nAlmost instantly he regretted his decision, leaning as far back into the\nshadows as he could, for a moment forgetting that he could simply disappear.</p><p>You strode into the bar, flashing a smile at the bar keeper,\nCrowley watching half curious, half terrified at what you could possibly doing\nhere.</p><p>You moved away after a few words and went and sat at your\nown table, letting Crowley relax in his spot but still not taking his eyes off\nof you and silently cursing himself.</p><p>Of all the places in the world that he could\u2019ve picked, he\nhad to walk into the one place that you happened to go to too.</p><p>He tried to put his attention back onto his glass, tried to\nget back into the nice state that he\u2019d been in, but his gaze was drawn to you\nconstantly, his only relief was when someone would come over and top up his\nglass.</p><p>Finally, he felt like he was winning his battle against you\nwhen he found his gaze locked on you once more and he found himself frozen in\nhis chair. \u00a0There was someone talking to\nyou and from what he could tell, you were lapping up the attention.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s hand closed too hard around his glass and it broke,\nmaking him look at his hand with a frown, a few shards having broken his skin,\nblood mixing with had been left in his glass.</p><p>The bar keeper was halfway through coming over when Crowley\nwas on his feet striding out of the pub, not wanting to stay in there a moment\nlonger as his stomach twisted in knots.</p><p>He was just about in a place where he could safely teleport\nhimself away when your voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d</p><p>He debated for a single moment whether he would turn around\nto face you or whether he would get himself out of there before he realised\nthere wasn\u2019t any point to even having that thought.</p><p>Pushing his annoyance aside, he turned to look at you with a\ngrin. \u00a0\u201cHello love, didn\u2019t realise you\ncame out to places like this.\u201d</p><p>You titled your head, having stopped several feet away from\nhim, clearly trying to work out what was going on. \u00a0\u201cNor I, you. \nI thought a demon of your calibre would have better standards.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shrugs it off. \n\u201cThey have the drink I like, who am I to say no.\u201d</p><p>Burying your hands in your pockets against the chill in the\nair, you rock a little on your heels, breaking your gaze away. \u00a0\u201cSo\u2026what was with what happened in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust more unfortunate incidents from the incompetent fools\nI work with.\u201d</p><p>You brought your gaze back to his and he knew that you\ndidn\u2019t believe him. \u00a0\u201cFunny, didn\u2019t think\nit\u2019d be worth breaking a glass over.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause between the two of you, sitting a little\nawkwardly in the air and you were both silently glad that there wasn\u2019t anyone\nelse around.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;ve dealt with more than your fair share of demons love,\nyou know what they are like.\u201d \u00a0Crowley\ntried to save the lie, but he knew by your strained smile that it was far too\nlate for that.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d You said quietly. \n\u201cBut I also know enough that it&rsquo;s not all bad.\u201d</p><p>Crowley stares at you, taking a moment to register your\nwords. \u00a0\u201cWe are the epitome of evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet a few of you still make the right choice from time\nto time.\u201d</p><p>He blanches.</p><p>Sighing, you pull your jacket closer around you. \u00a0\u201cEvil is too black and white Crowley,\neverything is much more complicated than that.\u201d You pause. \u00a0\u201cI&hellip;I&rsquo;ll leave you to get back to your\ndemons then.\u201d</p><p>Crowley watched you go, his mind working much too quick for\nhim to make sense of anything for a moment before he rashly made a decision.</p><p>\u201cY/N, wait.\u201d</p><p>You stopped and looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;\u201d He honestly wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say and he hated it.</p><p>\u201cYou don&rsquo;t have to say anything Crowley.\u201d You said softly,\nturning away again.</p><p>He teleports himself in front of you, making you take a\ncautious step back.</p><p>He holds his hands up quickly. \u00a0\u201cI&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t really know how to do\nthis.\u201d</p><p>You frowned. \u00a0\u201cYou\ndon&rsquo;t know how to do&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Crowley sighs. \u00a0\u201cTo\nsay thank you.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at your lips. \n\u201cYou don&rsquo;t know how to say thank you?\u201d</p><p>He purses his lips. \n\u201cI&rsquo;m trying here, okay? \nThis&hellip;this isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s usually part of my day to day.\u201d</p><p>You tilt your head. \u00a0\u201cOkay&hellip;but\nwhy are you thanking me?\u201d</p><p>Crowley thinks, forcing himself to take it slower this time,\ngetting his thoughts in order. \u00a0<b>\u201cMy peace has always depended on all the\nashes in my wake. \u00a0</b>You&rsquo;ve been\nchanging that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have?\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \n\u201cYou&hellip;you&rsquo;ve changed\u2026me. \u00a0A\nlot. \u00a0To be honest I can\u2019t say I\u2019m too\nhappy about it but there\u2019s also not really anything I can do about it or want\nto do about it.\u201d</p><p>Biting your lip a little and looking at him a little\nconfused, you give an unsure smile. \n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome? \u00a0I guess?\u201d</p><p>Crowley sighs, frustrated at himself. \u00a0\u201cDarling\u2026I\u2019m trying\u2026I\u2019m trying to say that\nyou\u2019ve made me better\u2026that I want to do more for you.\u201d \u00a0He drags his gaze away from yours. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve ever met that\u2019s\nactually given a damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my friend Crowley, of course I give a damn.\u201d \u00a0You said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever felt wrong, if that\u2019s what you\nneeded to hear?\u201d</p><p>Pausing, he glances at you, finding the gentility in your\ngaze that he\u2019d came to know too well and make his chest ache.</p><p>He nods before he says anything else foolish. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, you pat his arm as you walk past. \u00a0\u201cAnytime Crowley, happy to help where I\ncan.\u201d \u00a0He watches you start to walk away,\nbut turn back to face him. \u00a0\u201cJust\u2026maybe\ndon\u2019t think so much? \u00a0It seems to stop\nyou saying what you actually want to.\u201d \nYou wave back at him. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t let\nthe demons get you down Crowley!\u201d</p><p>Crowley watches you go, watches as you wander past the bar\nbut without going back in and he lets out a breathe that he didn\u2019t realise he\u2019d\nbeen holding.</p><p>Maybe, one day, he would take you up on that offer and say\nall that he wanted to say, but for now, this was enough.</p>",

ignoring all the activities around him. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t that he wanted to be here, but the\ntruth was, he needed a place to think and have a drink, something that the\nthrone room wasn\u2019t going to provide, especially once his demons realised he was\nthere.</p><p>He watched the golden liquid shift in his glass, catching in\nthe small amounts of light that reached him, and while he knew he was\nprocrastinating his own thoughts, he felt calmer than what he had in days.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like being like this, didn\u2019t like having things\nout of his control, and the worse thing about it all, he didn\u2019t have anyone\nthat he would dare even mention it too.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The door to the bar opened and for the first time since he\nsat down, he found his gaze wandering up. \nAlmost instantly he regretted his decision, leaning as far back into the\nshadows as he could, for a moment forgetting that he could simply disappear.</p><p>You strode into the bar, flashing a smile at the bar keeper,\nCrowley watching half curious, half terrified at what you could possibly doing\nhere.</p><p>You moved away after a few words and went and sat at your\nown table, letting Crowley relax in his spot but still not taking his eyes off\nof you and silently cursing himself.</p><p>Of all the places in the world that he could\u2019ve picked, he\nhad to walk into the one place that you happened to go to too.</p><p>He tried to put his attention back onto his glass, tried to\nget back into the nice state that he\u2019d been in, but his gaze was drawn to you\nconstantly, his only relief was when someone would come over and top up his\nglass.</p><p>Finally, he felt like he was winning his battle against you\nwhen he found his gaze locked on you once more and he found himself frozen in\nhis chair. \u00a0There was someone talking to\nyou and from what he could tell, you were lapping up the attention.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s hand closed too hard around his glass and it broke,\nmaking him look at his hand with a frown, a few shards having broken his skin,\nblood mixing with had been left in his glass.</p><p>The bar keeper was halfway through coming over when Crowley\nwas on his feet striding out of the pub, not wanting to stay in there a moment\nlonger as his stomach twisted in knots.</p><p>He was just about in a place where he could safely teleport\nhimself away when your voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d</p><p>He debated for a single moment whether he would turn around\nto face you or whether he would get himself out of there before he realised\nthere wasn\u2019t any point to even having that thought.</p><p>Pushing his annoyance aside, he turned to look at you with a\ngrin. \u00a0\u201cHello love, didn\u2019t realise you\ncame out to places like this.\u201d</p><p>You titled your head, having stopped several feet away from\nhim, clearly trying to work out what was going on. \u00a0\u201cNor I, you. \nI thought a demon of your calibre would have better standards.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shrugs it off. \n\u201cThey have the drink I like, who am I to say no.\u201d</p><p>Burying your hands in your pockets against the chill in the\nair, you rock a little on your heels, breaking your gaze away. \u00a0\u201cSo\u2026what was with what happened in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust more unfortunate incidents from the incompetent fools\nI work with.\u201d</p><p>You brought your gaze back to his and he knew that you\ndidn\u2019t believe him. \u00a0\u201cFunny, didn\u2019t think\nit\u2019d be worth breaking a glass over.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause between the two of you, sitting a little\nawkwardly in the air and you were both silently glad that there wasn\u2019t anyone\nelse around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dealt with more than your fair share of demons love,\nyou know what they are like.\u201d \u00a0Crowley\ntried to save the lie, but he knew by your strained smile that it was far too\nlate for that.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d You said quietly. \n\u201cBut I also know enough that it\u2019s not all bad.\u201d</p><p>Crowley stares at you, taking a moment to register your\nwords. \u00a0\u201cWe are the epitome of evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet a few of you still make the right choice from time\nto time.\u201d</p><p>He blanches.</p><p>Sighing, you pull your jacket closer around you. \u00a0\u201cEvil is too black and white Crowley,\neverything is much more complicated than that.\u201d You pause. \u00a0\u201cI\u2026I\u2019ll leave you to get back to your\ndemons then.\u201d</p><p>Crowley watched you go, his mind working much too quick for\nhim to make sense of anything for a moment before he rashly made a decision.</p><p>\u201cY/N, wait.\u201d</p><p>You stopped and looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d He honestly wasn\u2019t sure what to say and he hated it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything Crowley.\u201d You said softly,\nturning away again.</p><p>He teleports himself in front of you, making you take a\ncautious step back.</p><p>He holds his hands up quickly. \u00a0\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t really know how to do\nthis.\u201d</p><p>You frowned. \u00a0\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know how to do\u2026\u201d</p><p>Crowley sighs. \u00a0\u201cTo\nsay thank you.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at your lips. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to say thank you?\u201d</p><p>He purses his lips. \n\u201cI\u2019m trying here, okay? \nThis\u2026this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s usually part of my day to day.\u201d</p><p>You tilt your head. \u00a0\u201cOkay\u2026but\nwhy are you thanking me?\u201d</p><p>Crowley thinks, forcing himself to take it slower this time,\ngetting his thoughts in order. \u00a0<b>\u201cMy peace has always depended on all the\nashes in my wake. \u00a0</b>You\u2019ve been\nchanging that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have?\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \n\u201cYou\u2026you\u2019ve changed\u2026me. \u00a0A\nlot. \u00a0To be honest I can\u2019t say I\u2019m too\nhappy about it but there\u2019s also not really anything I can do about it or want\nto do about it.\u201d</p><p>Biting your lip a little and looking at him a little\nconfused, you give an unsure smile. \n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome? \u00a0I guess?\u201d</p><p>Crowley sighs, frustrated at himself. \u00a0\u201cDarling\u2026I\u2019m trying\u2026I\u2019m trying to say that\nyou\u2019ve made me better\u2026that I want to do more for you.\u201d \u00a0He drags his gaze away from yours. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve ever met that\u2019s\nactually given a damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my friend Crowley, of course I give a damn.\u201d \u00a0You said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever felt wrong, if that\u2019s what you\nneeded to hear?\u201d</p><p>Pausing, he glances at you, finding the gentility in your\ngaze that he\u2019d came to know too well and make his chest ache.</p><p>He nods before he says anything else foolish. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, you pat his arm as you walk past. \u00a0\u201cAnytime Crowley, happy to help where I\ncan.\u201d \u00a0He watches you start to walk away,\nbut turn back to face him. \u00a0\u201cJust\u2026maybe\ndon\u2019t think so much? \u00a0It seems to stop\nyou saying what you actually want to.\u201d \nYou wave back at him. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t let\nthe demons get you down Crowley!\u201d</p><p>Crowley watches you go, watches as you wander past the bar\nbut without going back in and he lets out a breathe that he didn\u2019t realise he\u2019d\nbeen holding.</p><p>Maybe, one day, he would take you up on that offer and say\nall that he wanted to say, but for now, this was enough.</p>",
