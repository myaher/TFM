I have to study for my exams during the holidays but it\u2019ll still be nice not having to go to lectures and seminars. I\u2019m sending you good vibes and luck for your papers and finals \ud83d\udc93 now I was wondering, what\u2019s your favourite ts album? top 5 songs? and what other artists do you like? I hope you have a lovely tuesday - ss \u2728",
        "answer": "<p>Thank you so much and same to you. You\u2019re an amazing secret santa\u00a0by the way and I can\u2019t wait to know you. And you\u2019re good I get it, I mean it\u2019s 2am here and I\u2019m up because I\u2019m an insomniac who doubles as a masochist apparently since I have to get up at 7.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve gone back and forth so many times about my favorite TS album. For a long time I thought Red. But then I sort of calculated based on my ranking of the songs and how the numbers averaged out and by that it pointed to Speak Now being my favorite. But also I love Reputation, so much. It might be because I feel like it\u2019s the album that most speaks to me personally or maybe just cause it helped me through a rough time, but currently I\u2019m leaning towards Reputation as my favorite album.\u00a0</p><p>Top 5 songs: I\u2019m super basic so my favorite is All Too Well but I mean I suppose there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite it\u2019s just so beautiful.\u00a0</p><p>Second is Call It What You Want and Third is You Are In Love, I think those are just very beautiful and it perfectly encapsulates what I guess I\u2019ve always wanted out of someone I love, I never really got into the more fairy tale, super perfection sort of love that was described as prime in the earlier songs. But in Call It What You Want, the lines: \u2018Trust him like a brother\u2019 and \u2018I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck not because he owns me but because he really knows me\u2019, just really stick with me cause I\u2019ve always wanted to be with someone who is super close to me and knows me and gets me and someone I trust so deeply cause trust and loyalty have always been the key traits I desire in friendship and love, and it\u2019s the same reason I love You Are In Love cause the line\u00a0\u2018You fight and you talk. One night he wakes, strange look on his face pauses, then says, you&rsquo;re my best friend\u2019 also has that same tie, I\u2019ve always wanted to be with someone who was my best friend basically and someone I can fight and talk to still be okay with cause I\u2019m someone who argues just to argue I suppose\u00a0but it\u2019s cause that\u2019s my learning style and it\u2019s how I learn I debate people and think aloud and force them to engage and build their argument against me cause I want them to give me everything they know or think and have all these and I think that\u2019s the best way to get it, and a lot of people don\u2019t understand that so I\u2019ve always really loved that line and it\u2019s made those songs for me.</p><p>Fourth is probably Dear John, that one is just really relatable to me and also has the deep emotional sort of narrative that makes All Too Well so great too.</p><p>Fifth, this one changes around a lot for me, but right now it\u2019s Come Back Be Here. I really love that one cause I think we\u2019ve all had someone who even if their not across the country or whatever feels far away and we miss them and want them back or maybe they\u2019ve changed but just the idea of distance.</p><p>(Sorry for those long symposiums)</p><p>As for other artists, Bastille is probably my second favorite they get me pretty good like Taylor. Other\u2019s include Queen, One Direction (my deep emotional cornerstone), Harry Styles &amp; Niall Horan as solo artists, My Chemical Romance (They also get me pretty deep), Ed Sheeran (also gets me), Panic! At The Disco, Pink Floyd (Also gets me), Fleetwood Mac (Love them), Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Adele, The 1975, Halsey, The Chainsmokers, 5 Seconds of Summer. I think those are the ones where I love at least 5+ songs from their discography.\u00a0</p>",

It might be because I feel like it\u2019s the album that most speaks to me personally or maybe just cause it helped me through a rough time, but currently I\u2019m leaning towards Reputation as my favorite album.\u00a0</p><p>Top 5 songs: I\u2019m super basic so my favorite is All Too Well but I mean I suppose there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite it\u2019s just so beautiful.\u00a0</p><p>Second is Call It What You Want and Third is You Are In Love, I think those are just very beautiful and it perfectly encapsulates what I guess I\u2019ve always wanted out of someone I love, I never really got into the more fairy tale, super perfection sort of love that was described as prime in the earlier songs. But in Call It What You Want, the lines: \u2018Trust him like a brother\u2019 and \u2018I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck not because he owns me but because he really knows me\u2019, just really stick with me cause I\u2019ve always wanted to be with someone who is super close to me and knows me and gets me and someone I trust so deeply cause trust and loyalty have always been the key traits I desire in friendship and love, and it\u2019s the same reason I love You Are In Love cause the line\u00a0\u2018You fight and you talk. One night he wakes, strange look on his face pauses, then says, you\u2019re my best friend\u2019 also has that same tie, I\u2019ve always wanted to be with someone who was my best friend basically and someone I can fight and talk to still be okay with cause I\u2019m someone who argues just to argue I suppose\u00a0but it\u2019s cause that\u2019s my learning style and it\u2019s how I learn I debate people and think aloud and force them to engage and build their argument against me cause I want them to give me everything they know or think and have all these and I think that\u2019s the best way to get it, and a lot of people don\u2019t understand that so I\u2019ve always really loved that line and it\u2019s made those songs for me.</p><p>Fourth is probably Dear John, that one is just really relatable to me and also has the deep emotional sort of narrative that makes All Too Well so great too.</p><p>Fifth, this one changes around a lot for me, but right now it\u2019s Come Back Be Here. I really love that one cause I think we\u2019ve all had someone who even if their not across the country or whatever feels far away and we miss them and want them back or maybe they\u2019ve changed but just the idea of distance.</p><p>(Sorry for those long symposiums)</p><p>As for other artists, Bastille is probably my second favorite they get me pretty good like Taylor. Other\u2019s include Queen, One Direction (my deep emotional cornerstone), Harry Styles &amp; Niall Horan as solo artists, My Chemical Romance (They also get me pretty deep), Ed Sheeran (also gets me), Panic! At The Disco, Pink Floyd (Also gets me), Fleetwood Mac (Love them), Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Adele, The 1975, Halsey, The Chainsmokers, 5 Seconds of Summer. I think those are the ones where I love at least 5+ songs from their discography.\u00a0</p>",
