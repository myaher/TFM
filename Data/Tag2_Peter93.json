One that is certainly on the dramatic side, but eloquent and graceful nonetheless.</p><p>This may be the clumsiest, most inept thing I have ever done.</p><p>It will definitely annoy Dormammu though.</p><p>\u201cCome out ass hat!\u201d I scream as I clench my fist and mimick pulling something down. Behind me, a skyscraper follows my movement and comes crashing down. I listen to the boom of stone and metal crashing and bending. The dust bursts behind my back but I don\u2019t pay any mind to it. I have more important things to think of.</p><p>My mom meant it when she said I was on my own after she left. Handling my dad was easy, but Dormammu is a whole other issue. One that required relentless planning. Now I know exactly what I need to do to win against him. Tony would think it\u2019s a horrible idea. Stephen might kill me for it if it didn\u2019t kill me. Peter would probably faint from the first sentence. It\u2019s the only way to win though. There\u2019s no other option.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go Dorma-bitch!\u201d I pull down another building. This one smashes against the building that he usually sits on. \u201cI have a complaint to make.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to get worried. If he doesn\u2019t come this will all have been for naught. He has to come if the spell is going to work. The spell Strange made.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d I twirl around. Cold wind bludgeons my face but I maintain my composure as I stare into Dormammu\u2019s neon purple eyes. \u201cSurely you could\u2019ve thought of a more creative insult than, Dorma-bitch. \u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHad you waited to show up a couple more minutes I might\u2019ve come up with something.\u201d He offers me what seems like a smile, though it\u2019s hard to see with his face rippling. \u201cI\u2019m here to make a bargain.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you all?\u201d he drones tiredly and leans back against a building. It groans under the weight of his body but he doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to like this one though.\u201d I sway to the side and kick away a brick. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me back all my magic, time stone remnants included, and I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I like that?\u201d</p><p>Silently, I begin making designs with my fingers. My sling ring purrs and even my magic tries to persuade me to stop. It\u2019s too late now. He\u2019s here and I have to save my family.</p><p>\u201cI hear hell is a lovely temperature year round.\u201d</p><p>His growl makes the ground underneath my feet shake. I have to brace myself on the stairway to keep from falling over. Looking up I see his fist prepared to come down on me, ensuring my death. Instead of recoiling I smirk. So far, everything is going as planned.</p><p>Now is the hardest part.</p><p>I close my eyes and feel the magic deep in the Earth, I feel my magic in Dormammu and I feel the magic that resides in dozens of dimensions in the multiverse. Without a second thought, I pull it into me.</p><p>It takes one moment to know that this isn\u2019t going to feel good. No sorcerer has ever drawn in this much energy and probably for good reason. Usually one just pulls it in bit by bit. It allows the multiverse to continuously replace it. Now I\u2019m shoving it all down my throat. It may be the worst idea I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>I slam my hands together. Every building around me, whether it\u2019s made of stone, glass or metal shatters. Light explodes out of every pore. The pain sears every cell in my body, but I keep pushing, keep shoving more magic in so I can keep the spell going. Strange required nearly an entire dimension\u2019s energy to do the spell on the Sanctum alone.</p><p>And I\u2019m going to do it on all of Earth.</p><p>Dormammu is screaming something at me but there is no time to listen. At this moment there is only the spell.</p><p>My sling ring is burning my fingers. My magic is entering and exiting my body from every direction. It feels like I\u2019m being ripped open \u2014but the spell.</p><p>I can feel my fingers working to complete the spell. There\u2019s an orb of light surrounding me, but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because of the suit or me. Probably both. In fact, the metal scales feel like they\u2019re burning away. Everything\u2019s burning.</p><p>I slowly bring my fingers together, preparing myself for what is to come. Like Strange\u2019s spell, this will be sending Dormammu and his zealots away but I did make some additions.</p><p>I concentrate on the glasses, on the spell wrapping around them so the video remains. I concentrate on the memories of this past week. Of my friends, Peter, Strange, Tony, and everyone remembering what has happened.</p><p>I imagine myself going to the mirror dimension with Dormammu.</p><p><i>That\u2019s the plan?</i> I imagine Stephen saying. <i>You\u2019re going to shut yourself in the mirror dimension with the most dangerous being alive.</i></p><p>I laugh through the pain, the heat of tears on my cheeks semi-apparent to me.</p><p><i>Well</i>, I would say back, <i>if I win, I\u2019ll be the most dangerous being alive.</i></p><p><i>You once got your hand stuck in the sink.</i></p><p><i>You had me on opioids!</i></p><p><i>And you started crying because you were afraid it was going to shred your magical fingers.</i></p><p>That makes me laugh again, even if the words aren\u2019t real. Even if they mean nothing. I laugh because what else can I do as the tips of my fingers connect and the spell ripples outwards.</p><p>I hear the sound of shattering glass, of the time spell following even as I\u2019m placed in an entirely different dimension. What I hear the most is the sound of Dormammu shrieking as his fist comes down right next to me.</p><p>I\u2019m thrown to the side, shards of glass and stone and metal chasing me down. I look over my shoulder and see the building I\u2019m approaching. Hastily, I conjure wings to keep me from hitting it. I\u2019ve exerted too much energy though, and it\u2019s a matter of seconds before I drop to the ground with a harsh crack. Pain shoots through my collarbone again. The bone never had the proper chance to heal.</p><p>\u201cYou really thought bringing me to the mirror dimension was wise?\u201d Dormammu ridicules. \u201cMy power here is infinite. I am the master of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I cough into my hand. When I look at my palm there is a pool of blood. \u201cWell, I think the mirror dimension could use a new queen.\u201d</p><p>This only enrages him, and I turn to see a tidal wave of buildings heading straight towards me. Raising my arms I pull in more energy. A bright blue shield encircles my bleeding figure. I push it out towards the tidal wave and watch as every building is pulverized.</p><p>When I turn around I see Dormammu staring on in disbelief. I don\u2019t utter a single syllable as I snap my fingers. The earth between us splits. Even the distorted planets around us shatter under my influence. And Dormammu only watches.</p><p>Once his attention returns to me I smirk up at him. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>I step into the air. Instead of my foot going straight through and hitting the ground again the wind brushes under it, pushing it up. I take another step. And another. The planets Dormammu has taken for himself continue collapsing in on themselves, all because of me.</p><p>Dormammu\u2019s face comes down to meet mine halfway. For the first time, he is not looming in front of me like this to assert his dominance but rather his curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N Y/L/N. I am the Bluebird. I am a powerful sorceress. I am one of Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes.\u201d I shrug lazily. \u201cMost of all, I\u2019m a teenage girl who\u2019s sick and tired of you controlling her life.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to reply, perhaps to insult me, but the sound of a million planets shooting towards him keeps the words from coming. Meanwhile, I turn my back to him and run. I run faster than I\u2019ve ever run. I skid down the steps made of air and wind. On the last couple, I trip and go flying forward. My body hits the ground. A chunk of metal collides with my head and a piece of an approaching planet strikes my shoulder. Pain ripples through my collar bone and I shriek out. Fatigue is starting to settle into my bones.</p><p>I stand though. I stand and run. My legs are pounding against the ground. My lungs are burning. If I could just make myself go faster\u2014</p><p>But if I use my magic any more than I already I have I risk even more fatigue. That would mean risking passing out which would mean I wouldn\u2019t get home. I have to get home. I have to get to Peter. I have to run. Run. Run. Run. <i>Run</i>.</p><p>Behind me, I can hear Dormammu. Hear him scream in agony as the planets smash against him. He must be fighting back, but the spell won\u2019t stop throwing planets at him until he\u2019s dead. That\u2019s why I had to get so close. Why I didn\u2019t have a head start. Because I had to place the marker on his head.</p><p>I raise my hands over my head as a sphere smashes against the earth next to me. Rubble is thrown underfoot and my feet threaten to falter. I stay upright though and keep sprinting. I just want to be a little further before I start making a portal and then\u2014</p><p>Dormammu\u2019s cold fingers wrap around my waist and pull me backward. I try kicking against his hand, scratching his palm, releasing my needle so it goes straight through his skin and bone. Nothing makes him release me and soon enough I\u2019m back where I started.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother screaming because there\u2019s no one here to hear me. Just Dormammu who would laugh. Laugh as we both got smashed to death. I could stop the spell but then I may never be able to begin it again. Then he could find a way back to Earth and everything I had done would be worthless. Not now. Not after my mom and dad. Not after I killed for my own gain.</p><p>Tears are beginning to run down my cheeks. I can\u2019t have lost. Not this way. Home. I have to get home.</p><p>And then he\u2019s squeezing. I gasp for air. There\u2019s a crack within his hand, but it\u2019s not coming from him. It\u2019s me. I bite my lip to cage the pain. Then there\u2019s another though. Then two more. I raise my head to the dark sky and pray that my back stays intact. That he only breaks my ribs.</p><p>I\u2019m thankful when he loosens his grip enough for me to breath. Before I realize it he\u2019s laying me back in his ice cold palm. Everything is becoming blurry. Even his neon eyes have turned warped. I see something bright pink in the corner of my eye. It has enough shape for me to tell it\u2019s a planet. I might run if I felt like I had the strength. Every breath of air hurts though. It would be so much easier to sleep than to run.</p><p>\u201cLittle bird,\u201d Dormammu murmurs. His voice is rough, telling me he was severely hurt. I do not look at him. Instead, I keep watching the great neon pink planet hurtling towards his head.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve broken your wings.\u201d I\u2019m faintly aware of his other hand coming towards me. It\u2019s only when it presses against my chest that I scream out. \u201cIs it kinder to let them heal,\u201d he wonders and raises his hand, but I see the way one finger sharpens into a thin point, \u201cor to put it out of its misery.\u201d</p><p>I see the pointed finger coming for me and I do not move. All I can do is watch as it pushes through what little remains of my suit, through my ashen clothes, through my bruised skin and into me. There is no scream that can match the amount of pain I feel in this moment. The only testament for how excruciating it is are the tears rolling down the side of my face. Black spots appear around my vision and I realize what is happening.</p><p>A cold shiver runs up my spine, the world fades a little, but I keep my gaze locked on the planet. Using what little energy I have left I focus my mind and watch as the planet is honed into a frighteningly sharp point.</p><p>Dormammu pulls his finger out of my abdomen. I feel my blood immediately rush out of the wound and hurry to cover it with my shaking hands.</p><p>He smiles down at me, victorious, but I see that the planet is far closer than before. He opens his mouth to mock me more.</p><p>The words are cut short by the neon shard slicing through the veil of black smoke. The noise when it splinters through his head is indescribable. If I weren\u2019t bleeding to death I might throw up.</p><p>His neon eyes go dark. The rippling in his face stops. Dormammu\u2019s hand drops\u2026</p><p>And I drop with it.</p><p>Suddenly there is only air against my back. Soft, rippling air. I\u2019m ready to keep falling. To find sleep while I\u2019m doing so, but the mantra comes back. <i>Home. Peter. Strange. Tony. Natasha. Thor. Bruce. Clint. Bucky.</i></p><p>The list goes on and on. All my reasons to get back home. <i>Aunt May. Ned. MJ. Heather.</i></p><p>I still have to talk to Wanda and Vision. I still have to get back at Loki for that dumb prank he pulled on me. I still have to visit the library with Wong but just end up making fun of Strange with him. Michelle owes me coffee and I owe May dinner. I promised to modify Ned\u2019s tech with a spell. Natasha wants to teach me how to dance. Clint wants to teach me sign language.</p><p>Bruce has to pay me back for accidentally causing me to astral project. Steve wants to take me to victory dinner for acing my chem test. I still have to make that Asgardian style vase for Thor in ceramics. I still have to repaint Bucky\u2019s arm after messing it up during lessons. I still have to let Tony make modifications on my suit. Strange still has to give me a tour of Kamar-taj so I can see what my magic is rooted from. Heather has to tell me everything that happened to her.</p><p>Peter is going to take me to prom.</p><p>I had so many reasons to leave but there\u2019s so many more to come back now, and I did not save them, I did not impact their lives just so I could abandon them now. I am not my father. I will go home. I am coming home.</p><p>I spin in the air so that I face the ground. Pulling my hand away from my gaping wound, I hold it in front of me and begin making a portal. I\u2019ll be cutting it close but I\u2019m coming home. More planets crash around. The ring of gold opens just before I hit the ground.</p><p>Instead, I land in the handcrafted feather bed I slept in at Kamar-Taj. I roll over, the pain too sharp in my stomach to actually enjoy the soft mattress. My feet find the ground and I stand. Everything hurts. I want to sleep, but I\u2019m almost home. All I have to do is find them now.</p><p>I wander clumsily through the halls. There\u2019s no one out, telling me that I must\u2019ve arrived either during lessons or the night. While one hand stays on my stomach the other follows the wall. There is a trail of blood left in my wake, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Finally, I hear the murmur of familiar voices through a nearby doorway.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me how we can get her back, Strange.\u201d Tony. Tony\u2019s here. That means Strange is too. I wonder if all the Avengers have come to see where I am.</p><p>\u201cAll we can do is wait.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like Stephan\u2019s voice. It does but it doesn\u2019t because I\u2019ve never heard him sound like that. Hopeless. I wish I didn\u2019t have to leave him hopeless.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Y/N doesn\u2019t make it that long?\u201d Then I lose my breath.</p><p>Because that\u2019s Peter\u2019s voice. My Peter\u2019s voice. I hadn\u2019t heard him in so long. For more than one instance I thought I never would again, but here I am, listening to his voice from my spot next to the doorway.</p><p>\u201cThe kids right, Strange,\u201d Tony agrees. \u201cYou told us yourself that this Dormammu guy is like a god. Y/N\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N is strong,\u201d Stephan interrupts. He\u2019s angry. \u201cBesides,\u201d I hear his footsteps as he walks across the room anxiously, \u201cshe hasn\u2019t left me with any other choice besides waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe siphoned all of our dimensions magic into her,\u201d he announces. \u201cThis dimension, the one of ours, before our, the one that lays a hundred dimensions away.\u201d I hear something thud as though Stephan had lost his temper. \u201cShe took it all and I can\u2019t get a hold of anything that\u2019s left. Even my sling ring can\u2019t get me to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice rings out helplessly. I want to step in now but I can only lean against the doorframe and wait for enough energy to return so that I might speak.</p><p>\u201cI think the video she left us explained that pretty well, kid.\u201d So they did see the video. How long was I gone then if they were able to find it in it\u2019s hiding spot. Maybe they just worked quick. Maybe I\u2019ve been gone for months and they just happened upon it. I don\u2019t know which answer I prefer.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014no.\u201d I can practically hear Peter\u2019s frustration boiling over. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do anything? Why can\u2019t we save her, you guys? You promised Y/N you would keep her safe and you failed!\u201d I flinch. \u201cWhy did we fail?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re all silent, not knowing the answer. I hear my own heartbeat hammering in my ears. Looking down at my stomach I see all the blood I\u2019ve lost. <i>Too much</i>.</p><p>\u201cBecause Y/N had to save herself one more time,\u201d Strange answers.</p><p>As I enter the small room there are so many different things I want to tell them. I want to say that I defeated Dormammu. That he\u2019s dead and that I got to meet my mom but I had to kill her to get out of my dad. That I think me killing her might\u2019ve been her way to escape my dad too. That I don\u2019t think she got to hear me when I said I love you.</p><p>I want to tell them I killed my dad too. That he told me things that still scare me and won\u2019t stop scaring me. That I found my best friend he killed when I was little and that she\u2019s been with me all this time.</p><p>I want to say that I was scared I\u2019d never see them again\u2026 Hear them again and that even just listening to their muffled voices through the walls of Kamar-taj brings me unimaginable peace. That I was a hero and I saved the Earth with my own two hands. But most importantly, I want to tell them that I missed them. That I came back because I want to live every last second of my life with them\u2026 even if I don\u2019t have much time left.</p><p>While I\u2019m trying to figure out what to say though, I realize that the three of them have already turned towards my bloody and beaten figure. I glance at each of them quickly to read their expressions. A soft giggle threatens to escape my throat when I see the way Tony&rsquo;s mouth has dropped open in silent shock. The way his eyes gleam a bit just from seeing me intact. That humor that was once in me though is replaced with dread when I see Stephens eyes scanning my entire body, expression hollowing when he sees the way my shirt has been stained a dark shade of death by the blood still slipping through my fingers. Finally, I look to Peter whose golden brown eyes are locked intently on me to make sure I don&rsquo;t disappear again. My gaze softens immediately at the sight of him and a warm tremor moves up and through my spine. I offer them all a single soft grin.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m home,\u201d I manage to force out of my mouth. Though it&rsquo;s only two words I feel that it conveys everything I need them to know in this moment. And although I wish I could be strong enough for Peter to rush worriedly to my side, to feel his lips on mine and the kind words that drop onto my bludgeoned body another tremor curls up and through every nerve in my body, pulling me towards something I&rsquo;m terrified of but ready to accept. Before the cloak can reach me or Peters webbing or even the sound of Tony shouting my name I fall backward and allow my eyes to roll into the back of my head.</p><hr><p><b>A/N: I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter!

If he doesn\u2019t come this will all have been for naught. He has to come if the spell is going to work. The spell Strange made.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d I twirl around. Cold wind bludgeons my face but I maintain my composure as I stare into Dormammu\u2019s neon purple eyes. \u201cSurely you could\u2019ve thought of a more creative insult than, Dorma-bitch. \u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHad you waited to show up a couple more minutes I might\u2019ve come up with something.\u201d He offers me what seems like a smile, though it\u2019s hard to see with his face rippling. \u201cI\u2019m here to make a bargain.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you all?\u201d he drones tiredly and leans back against a building. It groans under the weight of his body but he doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to like this one though.\u201d I sway to the side and kick away a brick. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me back all my magic, time stone remnants included, and I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I like that?\u201d</p><p>Silently, I begin making designs with my fingers. My sling ring purrs and even my magic tries to persuade me to stop. It\u2019s too late now. He\u2019s here and I have to save my family.</p><p>\u201cI hear hell is a lovely temperature year round.\u201d</p><p>His growl makes the ground underneath my feet shake. I have to brace myself on the stairway to keep from falling over. Looking up I see his fist prepared to come down on me, ensuring my death. Instead of recoiling I smirk. So far, everything is going as planned.</p><p>Now is the hardest part.</p><p>I close my eyes and feel the magic deep in the Earth, I feel my magic in Dormammu and I feel the magic that resides in dozens of dimensions in the multiverse. Without a second thought, I pull it into me.</p><p>It takes one moment to know that this isn\u2019t going to feel good. No sorcerer has ever drawn in this much energy and probably for good reason. Usually one just pulls it in bit by bit. It allows the multiverse to continuously replace it. Now I\u2019m shoving it all down my throat. It may be the worst idea I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>I slam my hands together. Every building around me, whether it\u2019s made of stone, glass or metal shatters. Light explodes out of every pore. The pain sears every cell in my body, but I keep pushing, keep shoving more magic in so I can keep the spell going. Strange required nearly an entire dimension\u2019s energy to do the spell on the Sanctum alone.</p><p>And I\u2019m going to do it on all of Earth.</p><p>Dormammu is screaming something at me but there is no time to listen. At this moment there is only the spell.</p><p>My sling ring is burning my fingers. My magic is entering and exiting my body from every direction. It feels like I\u2019m being ripped open \u2014but the spell.</p><p>I can feel my fingers working to complete the spell. There\u2019s an orb of light surrounding me, but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because of the suit or me. Probably both. In fact, the metal scales feel like they\u2019re burning away. Everything\u2019s burning.</p><p>I slowly bring my fingers together, preparing myself for what is to come. Like Strange\u2019s spell, this will be sending Dormammu and his zealots away but I did make some additions.</p><p>I concentrate on the glasses, on the spell wrapping around them so the video remains. I concentrate on the memories of this past week. Of my friends, Peter, Strange, Tony, and everyone remembering what has happened.</p><p>I imagine myself going to the mirror dimension with Dormammu.</p><p><i>That\u2019s the plan?</i> I imagine Stephen saying. <i>You\u2019re going to shut yourself in the mirror dimension with the most dangerous being alive.</i></p><p>I laugh through the pain, the heat of tears on my cheeks semi-apparent to me.</p><p><i>Well</i>, I would say back, <i>if I win, I\u2019ll be the most dangerous being alive.</i></p><p><i>You once got your hand stuck in the sink.</i></p><p><i>You had me on opioids!</i></p><p><i>And you started crying because you were afraid it was going to shred your magical fingers.</i></p><p>That makes me laugh again, even if the words aren\u2019t real. Even if they mean nothing. I laugh because what else can I do as the tips of my fingers connect and the spell ripples outwards.</p><p>I hear the sound of shattering glass, of the time spell following even as I\u2019m placed in an entirely different dimension. What I hear the most is the sound of Dormammu shrieking as his fist comes down right next to me.</p><p>I\u2019m thrown to the side, shards of glass and stone and metal chasing me down. I look over my shoulder and see the building I\u2019m approaching. Hastily, I conjure wings to keep me from hitting it. I\u2019ve exerted too much energy though, and it\u2019s a matter of seconds before I drop to the ground with a harsh crack. Pain shoots through my collarbone again. The bone never had the proper chance to heal.</p><p>\u201cYou really thought bringing me to the mirror dimension was wise?\u201d Dormammu ridicules. \u201cMy power here is infinite. I am the master of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I cough into my hand. When I look at my palm there is a pool of blood. \u201cWell, I think the mirror dimension could use a new queen.\u201d</p><p>This only enrages him, and I turn to see a tidal wave of buildings heading straight towards me. Raising my arms I pull in more energy. A bright blue shield encircles my bleeding figure. I push it out towards the tidal wave and watch as every building is pulverized.</p><p>When I turn around I see Dormammu staring on in disbelief. I don\u2019t utter a single syllable as I snap my fingers. The earth between us splits. Even the distorted planets around us shatter under my influence. And Dormammu only watches.</p><p>Once his attention returns to me I smirk up at him. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>I step into the air. Instead of my foot going straight through and hitting the ground again the wind brushes under it, pushing it up. I take another step. And another. The planets Dormammu has taken for himself continue collapsing in on themselves, all because of me.</p><p>Dormammu\u2019s face comes down to meet mine halfway. For the first time, he is not looming in front of me like this to assert his dominance but rather his curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N Y/L/N. I am the Bluebird. I am a powerful sorceress. I am one of Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes.\u201d I shrug lazily. \u201cMost of all, I\u2019m a teenage girl who\u2019s sick and tired of you controlling her life.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to reply, perhaps to insult me, but the sound of a million planets shooting towards him keeps the words from coming. Meanwhile, I turn my back to him and run. I run faster than I\u2019ve ever run. I skid down the steps made of air and wind. On the last couple, I trip and go flying forward. My body hits the ground. A chunk of metal collides with my head and a piece of an approaching planet strikes my shoulder. Pain ripples through my collar bone and I shriek out. Fatigue is starting to settle into my bones.</p><p>I stand though. I stand and run. My legs are pounding against the ground. My lungs are burning. If I could just make myself go faster\u2014</p><p>But if I use my magic any more than I already I have I risk even more fatigue. That would mean risking passing out which would mean I wouldn\u2019t get home. I have to get home. I have to get to Peter. I have to run. Run. Run. Run. <i>Run</i>.</p><p>Behind me, I can hear Dormammu. Hear him scream in agony as the planets smash against him. He must be fighting back, but the spell won\u2019t stop throwing planets at him until he\u2019s dead. That\u2019s why I had to get so close. Why I didn\u2019t have a head start. Because I had to place the marker on his head.</p><p>I raise my hands over my head as a sphere smashes against the earth next to me. Rubble is thrown underfoot and my feet threaten to falter. I stay upright though and keep sprinting. I just want to be a little further before I start making a portal and then\u2014</p><p>Dormammu\u2019s cold fingers wrap around my waist and pull me backward. I try kicking against his hand, scratching his palm, releasing my needle so it goes straight through his skin and bone. Nothing makes him release me and soon enough I\u2019m back where I started.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother screaming because there\u2019s no one here to hear me. Just Dormammu who would laugh. Laugh as we both got smashed to death. I could stop the spell but then I may never be able to begin it again. Then he could find a way back to Earth and everything I had done would be worthless. Not now. Not after my mom and dad. Not after I killed for my own gain.</p><p>Tears are beginning to run down my cheeks. I can\u2019t have lost. Not this way. Home. I have to get home.</p><p>And then he\u2019s squeezing. I gasp for air. There\u2019s a crack within his hand, but it\u2019s not coming from him. It\u2019s me. I bite my lip to cage the pain. Then there\u2019s another though. Then two more. I raise my head to the dark sky and pray that my back stays intact. That he only breaks my ribs.</p><p>I\u2019m thankful when he loosens his grip enough for me to breath. Before I realize it he\u2019s laying me back in his ice cold palm. Everything is becoming blurry. Even his neon eyes have turned warped. I see something bright pink in the corner of my eye. It has enough shape for me to tell it\u2019s a planet. I might run if I felt like I had the strength. Every breath of air hurts though. It would be so much easier to sleep than to run.</p><p>\u201cLittle bird,\u201d Dormammu murmurs. His voice is rough, telling me he was severely hurt. I do not look at him. Instead, I keep watching the great neon pink planet hurtling towards his head.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve broken your wings.\u201d I\u2019m faintly aware of his other hand coming towards me. It\u2019s only when it presses against my chest that I scream out. \u201cIs it kinder to let them heal,\u201d he wonders and raises his hand, but I see the way one finger sharpens into a thin point, \u201cor to put it out of its misery.\u201d</p><p>I see the pointed finger coming for me and I do not move. All I can do is watch as it pushes through what little remains of my suit, through my ashen clothes, through my bruised skin and into me. There is no scream that can match the amount of pain I feel in this moment. The only testament for how excruciating it is are the tears rolling down the side of my face. Black spots appear around my vision and I realize what is happening.</p><p>A cold shiver runs up my spine, the world fades a little, but I keep my gaze locked on the planet. Using what little energy I have left I focus my mind and watch as the planet is honed into a frighteningly sharp point.</p><p>Dormammu pulls his finger out of my abdomen. I feel my blood immediately rush out of the wound and hurry to cover it with my shaking hands.</p><p>He smiles down at me, victorious, but I see that the planet is far closer than before. He opens his mouth to mock me more.</p><p>The words are cut short by the neon shard slicing through the veil of black smoke. The noise when it splinters through his head is indescribable. If I weren\u2019t bleeding to death I might throw up.</p><p>His neon eyes go dark. The rippling in his face stops. Dormammu\u2019s hand drops\u2026</p><p>And I drop with it.</p><p>Suddenly there is only air against my back. Soft, rippling air. I\u2019m ready to keep falling. To find sleep while I\u2019m doing so, but the mantra comes back. <i>Home. Peter. Strange. Tony. Natasha. Thor. Bruce. Clint. Bucky.</i></p><p>The list goes on and on. All my reasons to get back home. <i>Aunt May. Ned. MJ. Heather.</i></p><p>I still have to talk to Wanda and Vision. I still have to get back at Loki for that dumb prank he pulled on me. I still have to visit the library with Wong but just end up making fun of Strange with him. Michelle owes me coffee and I owe May dinner. I promised to modify Ned\u2019s tech with a spell. Natasha wants to teach me how to dance. Clint wants to teach me sign language.</p><p>Bruce has to pay me back for accidentally causing me to astral project. Steve wants to take me to victory dinner for acing my chem test. I still have to make that Asgardian style vase for Thor in ceramics. I still have to repaint Bucky\u2019s arm after messing it up during lessons. I still have to let Tony make modifications on my suit. Strange still has to give me a tour of Kamar-taj so I can see what my magic is rooted from. Heather has to tell me everything that happened to her.</p><p>Peter is going to take me to prom.</p><p>I had so many reasons to leave but there\u2019s so many more to come back now, and I did not save them, I did not impact their lives just so I could abandon them now. I am not my father. I will go home. I am coming home.</p><p>I spin in the air so that I face the ground. Pulling my hand away from my gaping wound, I hold it in front of me and begin making a portal. I\u2019ll be cutting it close but I\u2019m coming home. More planets crash around. The ring of gold opens just before I hit the ground.</p><p>Instead, I land in the handcrafted feather bed I slept in at Kamar-Taj. I roll over, the pain too sharp in my stomach to actually enjoy the soft mattress. My feet find the ground and I stand. Everything hurts. I want to sleep, but I\u2019m almost home. All I have to do is find them now.</p><p>I wander clumsily through the halls. There\u2019s no one out, telling me that I must\u2019ve arrived either during lessons or the night. While one hand stays on my stomach the other follows the wall. There is a trail of blood left in my wake, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Finally, I hear the murmur of familiar voices through a nearby doorway.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me how we can get her back, Strange.\u201d Tony. Tony\u2019s here. That means Strange is too. I wonder if all the Avengers have come to see where I am.</p><p>\u201cAll we can do is wait.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like Stephan\u2019s voice. It does but it doesn\u2019t because I\u2019ve never heard him sound like that. Hopeless. I wish I didn\u2019t have to leave him hopeless.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Y/N doesn\u2019t make it that long?\u201d Then I lose my breath.</p><p>Because that\u2019s Peter\u2019s voice. My Peter\u2019s voice. I hadn\u2019t heard him in so long. For more than one instance I thought I never would again, but here I am, listening to his voice from my spot next to the doorway.</p><p>\u201cThe kids right, Strange,\u201d Tony agrees. \u201cYou told us yourself that this Dormammu guy is like a god. Y/N\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N is strong,\u201d Stephan interrupts. He\u2019s angry. \u201cBesides,\u201d I hear his footsteps as he walks across the room anxiously, \u201cshe hasn\u2019t left me with any other choice besides waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe siphoned all of our dimensions magic into her,\u201d he announces. \u201cThis dimension, the one of ours, before our, the one that lays a hundred dimensions away.\u201d I hear something thud as though Stephan had lost his temper. \u201cShe took it all and I can\u2019t get a hold of anything that\u2019s left. Even my sling ring can\u2019t get me to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice rings out helplessly. I want to step in now but I can only lean against the doorframe and wait for enough energy to return so that I might speak.</p><p>\u201cI think the video she left us explained that pretty well, kid.\u201d So they did see the video. How long was I gone then if they were able to find it in it\u2019s hiding spot. Maybe they just worked quick. Maybe I\u2019ve been gone for months and they just happened upon it. I don\u2019t know which answer I prefer.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014no.\u201d I can practically hear Peter\u2019s frustration boiling over. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do anything? Why can\u2019t we save her, you guys? You promised Y/N you would keep her safe and you failed!\u201d I flinch. \u201cWhy did we fail?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re all silent, not knowing the answer. I hear my own heartbeat hammering in my ears. Looking down at my stomach I see all the blood I\u2019ve lost. <i>Too much</i>.</p><p>\u201cBecause Y/N had to save herself one more time,\u201d Strange answers.</p><p>As I enter the small room there are so many different things I want to tell them. I want to say that I defeated Dormammu. That he\u2019s dead and that I got to meet my mom but I had to kill her to get out of my dad. That I think me killing her might\u2019ve been her way to escape my dad too. That I don\u2019t think she got to hear me when I said I love you.</p><p>I want to tell them I killed my dad too. That he told me things that still scare me and won\u2019t stop scaring me. That I found my best friend he killed when I was little and that she\u2019s been with me all this time.</p><p>I want to say that I was scared I\u2019d never see them again\u2026 Hear them again and that even just listening to their muffled voices through the walls of Kamar-taj brings me unimaginable peace. That I was a hero and I saved the Earth with my own two hands. But most importantly, I want to tell them that I missed them. That I came back because I want to live every last second of my life with them\u2026 even if I don\u2019t have much time left.</p><p>While I\u2019m trying to figure out what to say though, I realize that the three of them have already turned towards my bloody and beaten figure. I glance at each of them quickly to read their expressions. A soft giggle threatens to escape my throat when I see the way Tony\u2019s mouth has dropped open in silent shock. The way his eyes gleam a bit just from seeing me intact. That humor that was once in me though is replaced with dread when I see Stephens eyes scanning my entire body, expression hollowing when he sees the way my shirt has been stained a dark shade of death by the blood still slipping through my fingers. Finally, I look to Peter whose golden brown eyes are locked intently on me to make sure I don\u2019t disappear again. My gaze softens immediately at the sight of him and a warm tremor moves up and through my spine. I offer them all a single soft grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d I manage to force out of my mouth. Though it\u2019s only two words I feel that it conveys everything I need them to know in this moment. And although I wish I could be strong enough for Peter to rush worriedly to my side, to feel his lips on mine and the kind words that drop onto my bludgeoned body another tremor curls up and through every nerve in my body, pulling me towards something I\u2019m terrified of but ready to accept. Before the cloak can reach me or Peters webbing or even the sound of Tony shouting my name I fall backward and allow my eyes to roll into the back of my head.</p><hr><p><b>A/N: I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter!

One that is certainly on the dramatic side, but eloquent and graceful nonetheless.</p><p>This may be the clumsiest, most inept thing I have ever done.</p><p>It will definitely annoy Dormammu though.</p><p>\u201cCome out ass hat!\u201d I scream as I clench my fist and mimick pulling something down. Behind me, a skyscraper follows my movement and comes crashing down. I listen to the boom of stone and metal crashing and bending. The dust bursts behind my back but I don\u2019t pay any mind to it. I have more important things to think of.</p><p>My mom meant it when she said I was on my own after she left. Handling my dad was easy, but Dormammu is a whole other issue. One that required relentless planning. Now I know exactly what I need to do to win against him. Tony would think it\u2019s a horrible idea. Stephen might kill me for it if it didn\u2019t kill me. Peter would probably faint from the first sentence. It\u2019s the only way to win though. There\u2019s no other option.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go Dorma-bitch!\u201d I pull down another building. This one smashes against the building that he usually sits on. \u201cI have a complaint to make.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to get worried. If he doesn\u2019t come this will all have been for naught. He has to come if the spell is going to work. The spell Strange made.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d I twirl around. Cold wind bludgeons my face but I maintain my composure as I stare into Dormammu\u2019s neon purple eyes. \u201cSurely you could\u2019ve thought of a more creative insult than, Dorma-bitch. \u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHad you waited to show up a couple more minutes I might\u2019ve come up with something.\u201d He offers me what seems like a smile, though it\u2019s hard to see with his face rippling. \u201cI\u2019m here to make a bargain.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you all?\u201d he drones tiredly and leans back against a building. It groans under the weight of his body but he doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to like this one though.\u201d I sway to the side and kick away a brick. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me back all my magic, time stone remnants included, and I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I like that?\u201d</p><p>Silently, I begin making designs with my fingers. My sling ring purrs and even my magic tries to persuade me to stop. It\u2019s too late now. He\u2019s here and I have to save my family.</p><p>\u201cI hear hell is a lovely temperature year round.\u201d</p><p>His growl makes the ground underneath my feet shake. I have to brace myself on the stairway to keep from falling over. Looking up I see his fist prepared to come down on me, ensuring my death. Instead of recoiling I smirk. So far, everything is going as planned.</p><p>Now is the hardest part.</p><p>I close my eyes and feel the magic deep in the Earth, I feel my magic in Dormammu and I feel the magic that resides in dozens of dimensions in the multiverse. Without a second thought, I pull it into me.</p><p>It takes one moment to know that this isn\u2019t going to feel good. No sorcerer has ever drawn in this much energy and probably for good reason. Usually one just pulls it in bit by bit. It allows the multiverse to continuously replace it. Now I\u2019m shoving it all down my throat. It may be the worst idea I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>I slam my hands together. Every building around me, whether it\u2019s made of stone, glass or metal shatters. Light explodes out of every pore. The pain sears every cell in my body, but I keep pushing, keep shoving more magic in so I can keep the spell going. Strange required nearly an entire dimension\u2019s energy to do the spell on the Sanctum alone.</p><p>And I\u2019m going to do it on all of Earth.</p><p>Dormammu is screaming something at me but there is no time to listen. At this moment there is only the spell.</p><p>My sling ring is burning my fingers. My magic is entering and exiting my body from every direction. It feels like I\u2019m being ripped open \u2014but the spell.</p><p>I can feel my fingers working to complete the spell. There\u2019s an orb of light surrounding me, but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because of the suit or me. Probably both. In fact, the metal scales feel like they\u2019re burning away. Everything\u2019s burning.</p><p>I slowly bring my fingers together, preparing myself for what is to come. Like Strange\u2019s spell, this will be sending Dormammu and his zealots away but I did make some additions.</p><p>I concentrate on the glasses, on the spell wrapping around them so the video remains. I concentrate on the memories of this past week. Of my friends, Peter, Strange, Tony, and everyone remembering what has happened.</p><p>I imagine myself going to the mirror dimension with Dormammu.</p><p><i>That\u2019s the plan?</i> I imagine Stephen saying. <i>You\u2019re going to shut yourself in the mirror dimension with the most dangerous being alive.</i></p><p>I laugh through the pain, the heat of tears on my cheeks semi-apparent to me.</p><p><i>Well</i>, I would say back, <i>if I win, I\u2019ll be the most dangerous being alive.</i></p><p><i>You once got your hand stuck in the sink.</i></p><p><i>You had me on opioids!</i></p><p><i>And you started crying because you were afraid it was going to shred your magical fingers.</i></p><p>That makes me laugh again, even if the words aren\u2019t real. Even if they mean nothing. I laugh because what else can I do as the tips of my fingers connect and the spell ripples outwards.</p><p>I hear the sound of shattering glass, of the time spell following even as I\u2019m placed in an entirely different dimension. What I hear the most is the sound of Dormammu shrieking as his fist comes down right next to me.</p><p>I\u2019m thrown to the side, shards of glass and stone and metal chasing me down. I look over my shoulder and see the building I\u2019m approaching. Hastily, I conjure wings to keep me from hitting it. I\u2019ve exerted too much energy though, and it\u2019s a matter of seconds before I drop to the ground with a harsh crack. Pain shoots through my collarbone again. The bone never had the proper chance to heal.</p><p>\u201cYou really thought bringing me to the mirror dimension was wise?\u201d Dormammu ridicules. \u201cMy power here is infinite. I am the master of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I cough into my hand. When I look at my palm there is a pool of blood. \u201cWell, I think the mirror dimension could use a new queen.\u201d</p><p>This only enrages him, and I turn to see a tidal wave of buildings heading straight towards me. Raising my arms I pull in more energy. A bright blue shield encircles my bleeding figure. I push it out towards the tidal wave and watch as every building is pulverized.</p><p>When I turn around I see Dormammu staring on in disbelief. I don\u2019t utter a single syllable as I snap my fingers. The earth between us splits. Even the distorted planets around us shatter under my influence. And Dormammu only watches.</p><p>Once his attention returns to me I smirk up at him. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>I step into the air. Instead of my foot going straight through and hitting the ground again the wind brushes under it, pushing it up. I take another step. And another. The planets Dormammu has taken for himself continue collapsing in on themselves, all because of me.</p><p>Dormammu\u2019s face comes down to meet mine halfway. For the first time, he is not looming in front of me like this to assert his dominance but rather his curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N Y/L/N. I am the Bluebird. I am a powerful sorceress. I am one of Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes.\u201d I shrug lazily. \u201cMost of all, I\u2019m a teenage girl who\u2019s sick and tired of you controlling her life.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to reply, perhaps to insult me, but the sound of a million planets shooting towards him keeps the words from coming. Meanwhile, I turn my back to him and run. I run faster than I\u2019ve ever run. I skid down the steps made of air and wind. On the last couple, I trip and go flying forward. My body hits the ground. A chunk of metal collides with my head and a piece of an approaching planet strikes my shoulder. Pain ripples through my collar bone and I shriek out. Fatigue is starting to settle into my bones.</p><p>I stand though. I stand and run. My legs are pounding against the ground. My lungs are burning. If I could just make myself go faster\u2014</p><p>But if I use my magic any more than I already I have I risk even more fatigue. That would mean risking passing out which would mean I wouldn\u2019t get home. I have to get home. I have to get to Peter. I have to run. Run. Run. Run. <i>Run</i>.</p><p>Behind me, I can hear Dormammu. Hear him scream in agony as the planets smash against him. He must be fighting back, but the spell won\u2019t stop throwing planets at him until he\u2019s dead. That\u2019s why I had to get so close. Why I didn\u2019t have a head start. Because I had to place the marker on his head.</p><p>I raise my hands over my head as a sphere smashes against the earth next to me. Rubble is thrown underfoot and my feet threaten to falter. I stay upright though and keep sprinting. I just want to be a little further before I start making a portal and then\u2014</p><p>Dormammu\u2019s cold fingers wrap around my waist and pull me backward. I try kicking against his hand, scratching his palm, releasing my needle so it goes straight through his skin and bone. Nothing makes him release me and soon enough I\u2019m back where I started.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother screaming because there\u2019s no one here to hear me. Just Dormammu who would laugh. Laugh as we both got smashed to death. I could stop the spell but then I may never be able to begin it again. Then he could find a way back to Earth and everything I had done would be worthless. Not now. Not after my mom and dad. Not after I killed for my own gain.</p><p>Tears are beginning to run down my cheeks. I can\u2019t have lost. Not this way. Home. I have to get home.</p><p>And then he\u2019s squeezing. I gasp for air. There\u2019s a crack within his hand, but it\u2019s not coming from him. It\u2019s me. I bite my lip to cage the pain. Then there\u2019s another though. Then two more. I raise my head to the dark sky and pray that my back stays intact. That he only breaks my ribs.</p><p>I\u2019m thankful when he loosens his grip enough for me to breath. Before I realize it he\u2019s laying me back in his ice cold palm. Everything is becoming blurry. Even his neon eyes have turned warped. I see something bright pink in the corner of my eye. It has enough shape for me to tell it\u2019s a planet. I might run if I felt like I had the strength. Every breath of air hurts though. It would be so much easier to sleep than to run.</p><p>\u201cLittle bird,\u201d Dormammu murmurs. His voice is rough, telling me he was severely hurt. I do not look at him. Instead, I keep watching the great neon pink planet hurtling towards his head.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve broken your wings.\u201d I\u2019m faintly aware of his other hand coming towards me. It\u2019s only when it presses against my chest that I scream out. \u201cIs it kinder to let them heal,\u201d he wonders and raises his hand, but I see the way one finger sharpens into a thin point, \u201cor to put it out of its misery.\u201d</p><p>I see the pointed finger coming for me and I do not move. All I can do is watch as it pushes through what little remains of my suit, through my ashen clothes, through my bruised skin and into me. There is no scream that can match the amount of pain I feel in this moment. The only testament for how excruciating it is are the tears rolling down the side of my face. Black spots appear around my vision and I realize what is happening.</p><p>A cold shiver runs up my spine, the world fades a little, but I keep my gaze locked on the planet. Using what little energy I have left I focus my mind and watch as the planet is honed into a frighteningly sharp point.</p><p>Dormammu pulls his finger out of my abdomen. I feel my blood immediately rush out of the wound and hurry to cover it with my shaking hands.</p><p>He smiles down at me, victorious, but I see that the planet is far closer than before. He opens his mouth to mock me more.</p><p>The words are cut short by the neon shard slicing through the veil of black smoke. The noise when it splinters through his head is indescribable. If I weren\u2019t bleeding to death I might throw up.</p><p>His neon eyes go dark. The rippling in his face stops. Dormammu\u2019s hand drops\u2026</p><p>And I drop with it.</p><p>Suddenly there is only air against my back. Soft, rippling air. I\u2019m ready to keep falling. To find sleep while I\u2019m doing so, but the mantra comes back. <i>Home. Peter. Strange. Tony. Natasha. Thor. Bruce. Clint. Bucky.</i></p><p>The list goes on and on. All my reasons to get back home. <i>Aunt May. Ned. MJ. Heather.</i></p><p>I still have to talk to Wanda and Vision. I still have to get back at Loki for that dumb prank he pulled on me. I still have to visit the library with Wong but just end up making fun of Strange with him. Michelle owes me coffee and I owe May dinner. I promised to modify Ned\u2019s tech with a spell. Natasha wants to teach me how to dance. Clint wants to teach me sign language.</p><p>Bruce has to pay me back for accidentally causing me to astral project. Steve wants to take me to victory dinner for acing my chem test. I still have to make that Asgardian style vase for Thor in ceramics. I still have to repaint Bucky\u2019s arm after messing it up during lessons. I still have to let Tony make modifications on my suit. Strange still has to give me a tour of Kamar-taj so I can see what my magic is rooted from. Heather has to tell me everything that happened to her.</p><p>Peter is going to take me to prom.</p><p>I had so many reasons to leave but there\u2019s so many more to come back now, and I did not save them, I did not impact their lives just so I could abandon them now. I am not my father. I will go home. I am coming home.</p><p>I spin in the air so that I face the ground. Pulling my hand away from my gaping wound, I hold it in front of me and begin making a portal. I\u2019ll be cutting it close but I\u2019m coming home. More planets crash around. The ring of gold opens just before I hit the ground.</p><p>Instead, I land in the handcrafted feather bed I slept in at Kamar-Taj. I roll over, the pain too sharp in my stomach to actually enjoy the soft mattress. My feet find the ground and I stand. Everything hurts. I want to sleep, but I\u2019m almost home. All I have to do is find them now.</p><p>I wander clumsily through the halls. There\u2019s no one out, telling me that I must\u2019ve arrived either during lessons or the night. While one hand stays on my stomach the other follows the wall. There is a trail of blood left in my wake, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Finally, I hear the murmur of familiar voices through a nearby doorway.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me how we can get her back, Strange.\u201d Tony. Tony\u2019s here. That means Strange is too. I wonder if all the Avengers have come to see where I am.</p><p>\u201cAll we can do is wait.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like Stephan\u2019s voice. It does but it doesn\u2019t because I\u2019ve never heard him sound like that. Hopeless. I wish I didn\u2019t have to leave him hopeless.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Y/N doesn\u2019t make it that long?\u201d Then I lose my breath.</p><p>Because that\u2019s Peter\u2019s voice. My Peter\u2019s voice. I hadn\u2019t heard him in so long. For more than one instance I thought I never would again, but here I am, listening to his voice from my spot next to the doorway.</p><p>\u201cThe kids right, Strange,\u201d Tony agrees. \u201cYou told us yourself that this Dormammu guy is like a god. Y/N\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N is strong,\u201d Stephan interrupts. He\u2019s angry. \u201cBesides,\u201d I hear his footsteps as he walks across the room anxiously, \u201cshe hasn\u2019t left me with any other choice besides waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe siphoned all of our dimensions magic into her,\u201d he announces. \u201cThis dimension, the one of ours, before our, the one that lays a hundred dimensions away.\u201d I hear something thud as though Stephan had lost his temper. \u201cShe took it all and I can\u2019t get a hold of anything that\u2019s left. Even my sling ring can\u2019t get me to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice rings out helplessly. I want to step in now but I can only lean against the doorframe and wait for enough energy to return so that I might speak.</p><p>\u201cI think the video she left us explained that pretty well, kid.\u201d So they did see the video. How long was I gone then if they were able to find it in it\u2019s hiding spot. Maybe they just worked quick. Maybe I\u2019ve been gone for months and they just happened upon it. I don\u2019t know which answer I prefer.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014no.\u201d I can practically hear Peter\u2019s frustration boiling over. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do anything? Why can\u2019t we save her, you guys? You promised Y/N you would keep her safe and you failed!\u201d I flinch. \u201cWhy did we fail?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re all silent, not knowing the answer. I hear my own heartbeat hammering in my ears. Looking down at my stomach I see all the blood I\u2019ve lost. <i>Too much</i>.</p><p>\u201cBecause Y/N had to save herself one more time,\u201d Strange answers.</p><p>As I enter the small room there are so many different things I want to tell them. I want to say that I defeated Dormammu. That he\u2019s dead and that I got to meet my mom but I had to kill her to get out of my dad. That I think me killing her might\u2019ve been her way to escape my dad too. That I don\u2019t think she got to hear me when I said I love you.</p><p>I want to tell them I killed my dad too. That he told me things that still scare me and won\u2019t stop scaring me. That I found my best friend he killed when I was little and that she\u2019s been with me all this time.</p><p>I want to say that I was scared I\u2019d never see them again\u2026 Hear them again and that even just listening to their muffled voices through the walls of Kamar-taj brings me unimaginable peace. That I was a hero and I saved the Earth with my own two hands. But most importantly, I want to tell them that I missed them. That I came back because I want to live every last second of my life with them\u2026 even if I don\u2019t have much time left.</p><p>While I\u2019m trying to figure out what to say though, I realize that the three of them have already turned towards my bloody and beaten figure. I glance at each of them quickly to read their expressions. A soft giggle threatens to escape my throat when I see the way Tony\u2019s mouth has dropped open in silent shock. The way his eyes gleam a bit just from seeing me intact. That humor that was once in me though is replaced with dread when I see Stephens eyes scanning my entire body, expression hollowing when he sees the way my shirt has been stained a dark shade of death by the blood still slipping through my fingers. Finally, I look to Peter whose golden brown eyes are locked intently on me to make sure I don\u2019t disappear again. My gaze softens immediately at the sight of him and a warm tremor moves up and through my spine. I offer them all a single soft grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d I manage to force out of my mouth. Though it\u2019s only two words I feel that it conveys everything I need them to know in this moment. And although I wish I could be strong enough for Peter to rush worriedly to my side, to feel his lips on mine and the kind words that drop onto my bludgeoned body another tremor curls up and through every nerve in my body, pulling me towards something I\u2019m terrified of but ready to accept. Before the cloak can reach me or Peters webbing or even the sound of Tony shouting my name I fall backward and allow my eyes to roll into the back of my head.</p><hr><p><b>A/N: I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter!

One that is certainly on the dramatic side, but eloquent and graceful nonetheless.</p><p>This may be the clumsiest, most inept thing I have ever done.</p><p>It will definitely annoy Dormammu though.</p><p>&ldquo;Come out ass hat!&rdquo; I scream as I clench my fist and mimick pulling something down. Behind me, a skyscraper follows my movement and comes crashing down. I listen to the boom of stone and metal crashing and bending. The dust bursts behind my back but I don&rsquo;t pay any mind to it. I have more important things to think of.</p><p>My mom meant it when she said I was on my own after she left. Handling my dad was easy, but Dormammu is a whole other issue. One that required relentless planning. Now I know exactly what I need to do to win against him. Tony would think it&rsquo;s a horrible idea. Stephen might kill me for it if it didn&rsquo;t kill me. Peter would probably faint from the first sentence. It&rsquo;s the only way to win though. There&rsquo;s no other option.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go Dorma-bitch!&rdquo; I pull down another building. This one smashes against the building that he usually sits on. &ldquo;I have a complaint to make.&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m starting to get worried. If he doesn&rsquo;t come this will all have been for naught. He has to come if the spell is going to work. The spell Strange made.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo; I twirl around. Cold wind bludgeons my face but I maintain my composure as I stare into Dormammu&rsquo;s neon purple eyes. &ldquo;Surely you could&rsquo;ve thought of a more creative insult than, Dorma-bitch. &rdquo;</p><p>I shrug. &ldquo;Had you waited to show up a couple more minutes I might&rsquo;ve come up with something.&rdquo; He offers me what seems like a smile, though it&rsquo;s hard to see with his face rippling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to make a bargain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you all?&rdquo; he drones tiredly and leans back against a building. It groans under the weight of his body but he doesn&rsquo;t move.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re going to like this one though.&rdquo; I sway to the side and kick away a brick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to give me back all my magic, time stone remnants included, and I&rsquo;m going to kill you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why would I like that?&rdquo;</p><p>Silently, I begin making designs with my fingers. My sling ring purrs and even my magic tries to persuade me to stop. It&rsquo;s too late now. He&rsquo;s here and I have to save my family.</p><p>&ldquo;I hear hell is a lovely temperature year round.&rdquo;</p><p>His growl makes the ground underneath my feet shake. I have to brace myself on the stairway to keep from falling over. Looking up I see his fist prepared to come down on me, ensuring my death. Instead of recoiling I smirk. So far, everything is going as planned.</p><p>Now is the hardest part.</p><p>I close my eyes and feel the magic deep in the Earth, I feel my magic in Dormammu and I feel the magic that resides in dozens of dimensions in the multiverse. Without a second thought, I pull it into me.</p><p>It takes one moment to know that this isn&rsquo;t going to feel good. No sorcerer has ever drawn in this much energy and probably for good reason. Usually one just pulls it in bit by bit. It allows the multiverse to continuously replace it. Now I&rsquo;m shoving it all down my throat. It may be the worst idea I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p><p>I slam my hands together. Every building around me, whether it&rsquo;s made of stone, glass or metal shatters. Light explodes out of every pore. The pain sears every cell in my body, but I keep pushing, keep shoving more magic in so I can keep the spell going. Strange required nearly an entire dimension&rsquo;s energy to do the spell on the Sanctum alone.</p><p>And I&rsquo;m going to do it on all of Earth.</p><p>Dormammu is screaming something at me but there is no time to listen. At this moment there is only the spell.</p><p>My sling ring is burning my fingers. My magic is entering and exiting my body from every direction. It feels like I&rsquo;m being ripped open &mdash;but the spell.</p><p>I can feel my fingers working to complete the spell. There&rsquo;s an orb of light surrounding me, but I can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s because of the suit or me. Probably both. In fact, the metal scales feel like they&rsquo;re burning away. Everything&rsquo;s burning.</p><p>I slowly bring my fingers together, preparing myself for what is to come. Like Strange&rsquo;s spell, this will be sending Dormammu and his zealots away but I did make some additions.</p><p>I concentrate on the glasses, on the spell wrapping around them so the video remains. I concentrate on the memories of this past week. Of my friends, Peter, Strange, Tony, and everyone remembering what has happened.</p><p>I imagine myself going to the mirror dimension with Dormammu.</p><p><i>That&rsquo;s the plan?</i> I imagine Stephen saying. <i>You&rsquo;re going to shut yourself in the mirror dimension with the most dangerous being alive.</i></p><p>I laugh through the pain, the heat of tears on my cheeks semi-apparent to me.</p><p><i>Well</i>, I would say back, <i>if I win, I&rsquo;ll be the most dangerous being alive.</i></p><p><i>You once got your hand stuck in the sink.</i></p><p><i>You had me on opioids!</i></p><p><i>And you started crying because you were afraid it was going to shred your magical fingers.</i></p><p>That makes me laugh again, even if the words aren&rsquo;t real. Even if they mean nothing. I laugh because what else can I do as the tips of my fingers connect and the spell ripples outwards.</p><p>I hear the sound of shattering glass, of the time spell following even as I&rsquo;m placed in an entirely different dimension. What I hear the most is the sound of Dormammu shrieking as his fist comes down right next to me.</p><p>I&rsquo;m thrown to the side, shards of glass and stone and metal chasing me down. I look over my shoulder and see the building I&rsquo;m approaching. Hastily, I conjure wings to keep me from hitting it. I&rsquo;ve exerted too much energy though, and it&rsquo;s a matter of seconds before I drop to the ground with a harsh crack. Pain shoots through my collarbone again. The bone never had the proper chance to heal.</p><p>&ldquo;You really thought bringing me to the mirror dimension was wise?&rdquo; Dormammu ridicules. &ldquo;My power here is infinite. I am the master of this place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; I cough into my hand. When I look at my palm there is a pool of blood. &ldquo;Well, I think the mirror dimension could use a new queen.&rdquo;</p><p>This only enrages him, and I turn to see a tidal wave of buildings heading straight towards me. Raising my arms I pull in more energy. A bright blue shield encircles my bleeding figure. I push it out towards the tidal wave and watch as every building is pulverized.</p><p>When I turn around I see Dormammu staring on in disbelief. I don&rsquo;t utter a single syllable as I snap my fingers. The earth between us splits. Even the distorted planets around us shatter under my influence. And Dormammu only watches.</p><p>Once his attention returns to me I smirk up at him. &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</p><p>I step into the air. Instead of my foot going straight through and hitting the ground again the wind brushes under it, pushing it up. I take another step. And another. The planets Dormammu has taken for himself continue collapsing in on themselves, all because of me.</p><p>Dormammu&rsquo;s face comes down to meet mine halfway. For the first time, he is not looming in front of me like this to assert his dominance but rather his curiosity.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N Y/L/N. I am the Bluebird. I am a powerful sorceress. I am one of Earth&rsquo;s mightiest heroes.&rdquo; I shrug lazily. &ldquo;Most of all, I&rsquo;m a teenage girl who&rsquo;s sick and tired of you controlling her life.&rdquo;</p><p>He opens his mouth to reply, perhaps to insult me, but the sound of a million planets shooting towards him keeps the words from coming. Meanwhile, I turn my back to him and run. I run faster than I&rsquo;ve ever run. I skid down the steps made of air and wind. On the last couple, I trip and go flying forward. My body hits the ground. A chunk of metal collides with my head and a piece of an approaching planet strikes my shoulder. Pain ripples through my collar bone and I shriek out. Fatigue is starting to settle into my bones.</p><p>I stand though. I stand and run. My legs are pounding against the ground. My lungs are burning. If I could just make myself go faster&mdash;</p><p>But if I use my magic any more than I already I have I risk even more fatigue. That would mean risking passing out which would mean I wouldn&rsquo;t get home. I have to get home. I have to get to Peter. I have to run. Run. Run. Run. <i>Run</i>.</p><p>Behind me, I can hear Dormammu. Hear him scream in agony as the planets smash against him. He must be fighting back, but the spell won&rsquo;t stop throwing planets at him until he&rsquo;s dead. That&rsquo;s why I had to get so close. Why I didn&rsquo;t have a head start. Because I had to place the marker on his head.</p><p>I raise my hands over my head as a sphere smashes against the earth next to me. Rubble is thrown underfoot and my feet threaten to falter. I stay upright though and keep sprinting. I just want to be a little further before I start making a portal and then&mdash;</p><p>Dormammu&rsquo;s cold fingers wrap around my waist and pull me backward. I try kicking against his hand, scratching his palm, releasing my needle so it goes straight through his skin and bone. Nothing makes him release me and soon enough I&rsquo;m back where I started.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t bother screaming because there&rsquo;s no one here to hear me. Just Dormammu who would laugh. Laugh as we both got smashed to death. I could stop the spell but then I may never be able to begin it again. Then he could find a way back to Earth and everything I had done would be worthless. Not now. Not after my mom and dad. Not after I killed for my own gain.</p><p>Tears are beginning to run down my cheeks. I can&rsquo;t have lost. Not this way. Home. I have to get home.</p><p>And then he&rsquo;s squeezing. I gasp for air. There&rsquo;s a crack within his hand, but it&rsquo;s not coming from him. It&rsquo;s me. I bite my lip to cage the pain. Then there&rsquo;s another though. Then two more. I raise my head to the dark sky and pray that my back stays intact. That he only breaks my ribs.</p><p>I&rsquo;m thankful when he loosens his grip enough for me to breath. Before I realize it he&rsquo;s laying me back in his ice cold palm. Everything is becoming blurry. Even his neon eyes have turned warped. I see something bright pink in the corner of my eye. It has enough shape for me to tell it&rsquo;s a planet. I might run if I felt like I had the strength. Every breath of air hurts though. It would be so much easier to sleep than to run.</p><p>&ldquo;Little bird,&rdquo; Dormammu murmurs. His voice is rough, telling me he was severely hurt. I do not look at him. Instead, I keep watching the great neon pink planet hurtling towards his head.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;ve broken your wings.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m faintly aware of his other hand coming towards me. It&rsquo;s only when it presses against my chest that I scream out. &ldquo;Is it kinder to let them heal,&rdquo; he wonders and raises his hand, but I see the way one finger sharpens into a thin point, &ldquo;or to put it out of its misery.&rdquo;</p><p>I see the pointed finger coming for me and I do not move. All I can do is watch as it pushes through what little remains of my suit, through my ashen clothes, through my bruised skin and into me. There is no scream that can match the amount of pain I feel in this moment. The only testament for how excruciating it is are the tears rolling down the side of my face. Black spots appear around my vision and I realize what is happening.</p><p>A cold shiver runs up my spine, the world fades a little, but I keep my gaze locked on the planet. Using what little energy I have left I focus my mind and watch as the planet is honed into a frighteningly sharp point.</p><p>Dormammu pulls his finger out of my abdomen. I feel my blood immediately rush out of the wound and hurry to cover it with my shaking hands.</p><p>He smiles down at me, victorious, but I see that the planet is far closer than before. He opens his mouth to mock me more.</p><p>The words are cut short by the neon shard slicing through the veil of black smoke. The noise when it splinters through his head is indescribable. If I weren&rsquo;t bleeding to death I might throw up.</p><p>His neon eyes go dark. The rippling in his face stops. Dormammu&rsquo;s hand drops&hellip;</p><p>And I drop with it.</p><p>Suddenly there is only air against my back. Soft, rippling air. I&rsquo;m ready to keep falling. To find sleep while I&rsquo;m doing so, but the mantra comes back. <i>Home. Peter. Strange. Tony. Natasha. Thor. Bruce. Clint. Bucky.</i></p><p>The list goes on and on. All my reasons to get back home. <i>Aunt May. Ned. MJ. Heather.</i></p><p>I still have to talk to Wanda and Vision. I still have to get back at Loki for that dumb prank he pulled on me. I still have to visit the library with Wong but just end up making fun of Strange with him. Michelle owes me coffee and I owe May dinner. I promised to modify Ned&rsquo;s tech with a spell. Natasha wants to teach me how to dance. Clint wants to teach me sign language.</p><p>Bruce has to pay me back for accidentally causing me to astral project. Steve wants to take me to victory dinner for acing my chem test. I still have to make that Asgardian style vase for Thor in ceramics. I still have to repaint Bucky&rsquo;s arm after messing it up during lessons. I still have to let Tony make modifications on my suit. Strange still has to give me a tour of Kamar-taj so I can see what my magic is rooted from. Heather has to tell me everything that happened to her.</p><p>Peter is going to take me to prom.</p><p>I had so many reasons to leave but there&rsquo;s so many more to come back now, and I did not save them, I did not impact their lives just so I could abandon them now. I am not my father. I will go home. I am coming home.</p><p>I spin in the air so that I face the ground. Pulling my hand away from my gaping wound, I hold it in front of me and begin making a portal. I&rsquo;ll be cutting it close but I&rsquo;m coming home. More planets crash around. The ring of gold opens just before I hit the ground.</p><p>Instead, I land in the handcrafted feather bed I slept in at Kamar-Taj. I roll over, the pain too sharp in my stomach to actually enjoy the soft mattress. My feet find the ground and I stand. Everything hurts. I want to sleep, but I&rsquo;m almost home. All I have to do is find them now.</p><p>I wander clumsily through the halls. There&rsquo;s no one out, telling me that I must&rsquo;ve arrived either during lessons or the night. While one hand stays on my stomach the other follows the wall. There is a trail of blood left in my wake, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p><p>Finally, I hear the murmur of familiar voices through a nearby doorway.</p><p>&ldquo;Just tell me how we can get her back, Strange.&rdquo; Tony. Tony&rsquo;s here. That means Strange is too. I wonder if all the Avengers have come to see where I am.</p><p>&ldquo;All we can do is wait.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t sound like Stephan&rsquo;s voice. It does but it doesn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;ve never heard him sound like that. Hopeless. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to leave him hopeless.</p><p>&ldquo;What if Y/N doesn&rsquo;t make it that long?&rdquo; Then I lose my breath.</p><p>Because that&rsquo;s Peter&rsquo;s voice. My Peter&rsquo;s voice. I hadn&rsquo;t heard him in so long. For more than one instance I thought I never would again, but here I am, listening to his voice from my spot next to the doorway.</p><p>&ldquo;The kids right, Strange,&rdquo; Tony agrees. &ldquo;You told us yourself that this Dormammu guy is like a god. Y/N&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N is strong,&rdquo; Stephan interrupts. He&rsquo;s angry. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; I hear his footsteps as he walks across the room anxiously, &ldquo;she hasn&rsquo;t left me with any other choice besides waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She siphoned all of our dimensions magic into her,&rdquo; he announces. &ldquo;This dimension, the one of ours, before our, the one that lays a hundred dimensions away.&rdquo; I hear something thud as though Stephan had lost his temper. &ldquo;She took it all and I can&rsquo;t get a hold of anything that&rsquo;s left. Even my sling ring can&rsquo;t get me to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice rings out helplessly. I want to step in now but I can only lean against the doorframe and wait for enough energy to return so that I might speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I think the video she left us explained that pretty well, kid.&rdquo; So they did see the video. How long was I gone then if they were able to find it in it&rsquo;s hiding spot. Maybe they just worked quick. Maybe I&rsquo;ve been gone for months and they just happened upon it. I don&rsquo;t know which answer I prefer.</p><p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no.&rdquo; I can practically hear Peter&rsquo;s frustration boiling over. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we do anything? Why can&rsquo;t we save her, you guys? You promised Y/N you would keep her safe and you failed!&rdquo; I flinch. &ldquo;Why did we fail?&rdquo;</p><p>They&rsquo;re all silent, not knowing the answer. I hear my own heartbeat hammering in my ears. Looking down at my stomach I see all the blood I&rsquo;ve lost. <i>Too much</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Because Y/N had to save herself one more time,&rdquo; Strange answers.</p><p>As I enter the small room there are so many different things I want to tell them. I want to say that I defeated Dormammu. That he&rsquo;s dead and that I got to meet my mom but I had to kill her to get out of my dad. That I think me killing her might&rsquo;ve been her way to escape my dad too. That I don&rsquo;t think she got to hear me when I said I love you.</p><p>I want to tell them I killed my dad too. That he told me things that still scare me and won&rsquo;t stop scaring me. That I found my best friend he killed when I was little and that she&rsquo;s been with me all this time.</p><p>I want to say that I was scared I&rsquo;d never see them again&hellip; Hear them again and that even just listening to their muffled voices through the walls of Kamar-taj brings me unimaginable peace. That I was a hero and I saved the Earth with my own two hands. But most importantly, I want to tell them that I missed them. That I came back because I want to live every last second of my life with them&hellip; even if I don&rsquo;t have much time left.</p><p>While I&rsquo;m trying to figure out what to say though, I realize that the three of them have already turned towards my bloody and beaten figure. I glance at each of them quickly to read their expressions. A soft giggle threatens to escape my throat when I see the way Tony&rsquo;s mouth has dropped open in silent shock. The way his eyes gleam a bit just from seeing me intact. That humor that was once in me though is replaced with dread when I see Stephens eyes scanning my entire body, expression hollowing when he sees the way my shirt has been stained a dark shade of death by the blood still slipping through my fingers. Finally, I look to Peter whose golden brown eyes are locked intently on me to make sure I don&rsquo;t disappear again. My gaze softens immediately at the sight of him and a warm tremor moves up and through my spine. I offer them all a single soft grin.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo; I manage to force out of my mouth. Though it&rsquo;s only two words I feel that it conveys everything I need them to know in this moment. And although I wish I could be strong enough for Peter to rush worriedly to my side, to feel his lips on mine and the kind words that drop onto my bludgeoned body another tremor curls up and through every nerve in my body, pulling me towards something I&rsquo;m terrified of but ready to accept. Before the cloak can reach me or Peters webbing or even the sound of Tony shouting my name I fall backward and allow my eyes to roll into the back of my head.</p><hr /><p><b>A/N: I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter!

One that is certainly on the dramatic side, but eloquent and graceful nonetheless.</p>\n<p>This may be the clumsiest, most inept thing I have ever done.</p>\n<p>It will definitely annoy Dormammu though.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come out ass hat!&rdquo; I scream as I clench my fist and mimick pulling something down. Behind me, a skyscraper follows my movement and comes crashing down. I listen to the boom of stone and metal crashing and bending. The dust bursts behind my back but I don&rsquo;t pay any mind to it. I have more important things to think of.</p>\n<p>My mom meant it when she said I was on my own after she left. Handling my dad was easy, but Dormammu is a whole other issue. One that required relentless planning. Now I know exactly what I need to do to win against him. Tony would think it&rsquo;s a horrible idea. Stephen might kill me for it if it didn&rsquo;t kill me. Peter would probably faint from the first sentence. It&rsquo;s the only way to win though. There&rsquo;s no other option.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go Dorma-bitch!&rdquo; I pull down another building. This one smashes against the building that he usually sits on. &ldquo;I have a complaint to make.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m starting to get worried. If he doesn&rsquo;t come this will all have been for naught. He has to come if the spell is going to work. The spell Strange made.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo; I twirl around. Cold wind bludgeons my face but I maintain my composure as I stare into Dormammu&rsquo;s neon purple eyes. &ldquo;Surely you could&rsquo;ve thought of a more creative insult than, Dorma-bitch. &rdquo;</p>\n<p>I shrug. &ldquo;Had you waited to show up a couple more minutes I might&rsquo;ve come up with something.&rdquo; He offers me what seems like a smile, though it&rsquo;s hard to see with his face rippling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to make a bargain.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
