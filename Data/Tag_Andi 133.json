They&rsquo;d be too intimidated to even try.&rdquo; &ldquo;That was the old you though, TJ. You&rsquo;re not like that. You&rsquo;re nice, funny, caring, sweet&hellip;. You actually smile!!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, the old TJ.. Found his outlet alright.. Intimidation.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the new TJ??&rdquo; &ldquo;He found a new outlet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Which was??&rdquo; TJ stares into Cyrus&rsquo; eyes and smiles. &ldquo;Well TJ ?? What outlet did the new TJ find??&rdquo; &ldquo;I found you.&rdquo; </p></p>",

Between difficult challenges, silly \nmoments of fun, and everything in between, they start to form bond \nbetween each other.

Blindly, he draped an arm atop the nightstand and winced, shutting off the noise. He squinted at the clock; 7:30. Too early to bother anybody, he supposed. He\u2019d forgotten to turn off his alarm, considering they weren\u2019t shooting today, and there was no way he was going to be able to fall back asleep. He rolled and grabbed his phone, scrolling mindlessly through his Instagram feed. He really missed seeing his friends, even if it was only for a little while. Suddenly he wished he had TJ\u2019s number so he could text him.</p><p>He lay in bed for a little while longer, thinking of possible things to do that day. He had a deck of cards in his bag, which would probably be good for a little while. He figured people would meet him in the lobby when they were ready, so he didn\u2019t bother waiting. Cyrus slowly got out of bed, and made his way to the bathroom to get ready for the day. He changed into a pair of sweatpants and a Queen shirt before he snatched the cards and his phone from his bag.</p><p>The hotel was silent, save for a few clinks downstairs, probably from the breakfast crew. He padded down the hallway, nearly missing the elevator on the way there. He was alone in the elevator, thankfully, tapping his fingers to the beat of the soft music that was playing. Once the doors opened on the lobby floor, he stepped out, and made a right towards the set of couches. He swore he almost choked on his own spit when he rounded the corner.</p><p>TJ was sitting there, hair styled in a way that could only be described as a rat\u2019s nest, and thick-rimmed glasses perched on the bridge of his nose.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen something so pretty in a long time.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said with a wave, snapping TJ out of whatever haze he was in.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey,\u201d he mumbled, scooting over to one side of the couch, \u201cwhy are you here so early?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed at that, taking a seat and sinking into the couch. \u201cI could ask you the same thing,\u201d he pointed out, his gaze flitting from TJ to the fading pattern of the couch.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d TJ said lamely, picking at the skin by his thumb, \u201cwhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;forgot to turn off my alarm,\u201d he admitted, to which TJ broke out into laughter. His laugh was interrupted by snorts, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. <i>Must be really sleep deprived</i>, Cyrus thought.</p><p>\u201cSorry that\u2019s-\u201d he wiped away a tear, a grin still plastered on his face, \u201cthat\u2019s hilarious,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, laugh it up,\u201d Cyrus teased, giving him a light shove, \u201cat least I <i>got </i>some sleep,\u201d</p><p>TJ yawned, as if to prove Cyrus\u2019 point. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he chuckled, shaking his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think the others are going to be awake for a while. You wanna do something? We can hang out in my room, if you want. My mom went out for coffee with some of the other parents,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his insides light up; TJ wanted to hang out with him? \u201cOh, uh, yeah, that sounds&hellip;good,\u201d he stammered, attempting to put together a coherent sentence.</p><p>TJ smiled, standing up and nodding in the direction of the elevator. \u201cHope you\u2019re ready for me to bore you to death,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes; what a false statement. He reached for the elevator button, but TJ has the same idea, their fingers brushing each other\u2019s gently. Cyrus froze, hand still hovering by the button before he pressed it. It felt like he and TJ were standing outside the doors forever, but eventually they opened.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d TJ broke the silence, clicking one of the buttons, \u201cwhat do you wanna do?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, leaning back against the handle. \u201cI have cards, if you wanna play,\u201d he offered, and he was greeted with silence, \u201cor&hellip;we could do something else,\u201d</p><p>The doors opened at TJ\u2019s floor, and the two of them stepped out. TJ fished the key card out of his pocket and swiped it to unlock the door. He leaned against the frame of the door. \u201cYou\u2019re interesting,\u201d he pointed out, opening the door, \u201cI like that,\u201d</p><p>Before Cyrus could even begin to form a reply to that, TJ was talking again.</p><p>\u201cBy which I mean, I want to get to know you better,\u201d he clarified, taking a seat on the bed, and making room for his guest.</p><p>Cyrus raised a brow at that; nobody was ever that direct with trying to get to know him. He slowly walked towards him, taking a seat on the edge of the bed and bringing his knees into his chest. \u201cWell, what do you wanna know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends, what do you wanna tell me?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, pulling out his phone. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be difficult,\u201d he mumbled, tapping a few times before he let a small smile tug at his lips, \u201chere,\u201d he said, handing TJ his phone.</p><p>\u201cA hundred and one things to ask to get to know someone,\u201d he read, barking a laugh, \u201cyeah, okay, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, feeling a little more at ease. He could do this for a little while.</p><hr><p>\u201cAlright, first question,\u201d TJ started, using his announcer voice, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201clet\u2019s start with something light. If you didn\u2019t need to sleep to survive, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d he hummed. Not exactly what he was expecting. \u201cI guess&hellip;probably just watch YouTube videos, or documentaries,\u201d he supplied lamely, ending it with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of documentaries?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was surprised TJ even cared. \u201cMostly one about dinosaurs,\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I\u2019d just, like, take walks. It sounds weird, but there\u2019s nothing like a walk at two in the morning,\u201d</p><p><i>What an ungodly hour</i>, Cyrus thought to himself, offering a soft smile. \u201cThat\u2019s not weird,\u201d he corrected him, \u201cI\u2019d never thought about that. Probably because I end up falling asleep before midnight pretty much every single day,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext question,\u201d TJ continued, \u201cWhen was the last time you climbed a tree?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus bit down on his lip, trying to suppress a giggle. \u201cI uh, I\u2019ve never actually&hellip;climbed a tree,\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly dropped the phone, his eyes bugging out of his head. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d he squawked, to which Cyrus nodded, \u201cyou\u2019re missing out, dude. It\u2019s so much fun! You can see so many things when you get up higher,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus put his hand up awkwardly. \u201cAfraid of heights,\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed, slapping a hand on his forehead. Cyrus expected that; a lot of people laughed when he admitted his fears. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean like climb a forty foot tree, Cyrus. I meant, like, ten feet,\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s just so much better,\u201d he teased, \u201cwhen\u2019s the last time you climbed a tree?\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned, remembering the day. \u201cI think I was in, like, middle school. My buddy Lester and I were hanging out and we tried to see who could climb the highest,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cAnd let me guess,\u201d Cyrus began, \u201clike the athlete that you are, you won,\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually&hellip;\u201d he trailed, hesitating a little, \u201cI got a little overconfident and tried to skip a branch, so I fell and broke my arm,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell out of a tree? What are you, like, an acorn?\u201d Cyrus laughed at his own quote. He expected TJ to look at him with a confused face, but instead he lit up.</p><p>\u201cYou like Dear Evan Hansen?\u201d he asked quietly, excitement brimming.</p><p>Cyrus stared at him for a second, blinking once. \u201cI&hellip;you know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf <i>course </i>I do, man! It\u2019s one of my favorite musicals,\u201d he exclaimed, shaking his head, \u201cnot many people in my day to day life know about it, so I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d</p><p><i>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here</i>. Cyrus must have repeated those words in his head a few dozen times before he said anything. \u201cNext question,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s something that a lot of people are obsessed with, but you don\u2019t get the hype?\u201d</p><p>And at the same time, both boys cried out, \u201cDuck faces!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed so hard he snorted, not even bothering to feel embarrassed. \u201cWe really are the same people,\u201d he chuckled, carding a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s find some less superficial questions,\u201d he smiled, scrolling down the list, \u201cwhat\u2019s the dumbest thing you\u2019ve done that actually turned out well?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus froze. He knew the answer to the question; he didn\u2019t even have to think about it. But&hellip;the thought of saying something now? TJ probably saw that he was visibly uncomfortable, so he put the phone down, placing a hand on the other boy\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You don\u2019t have to answer that, I can pick another-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-no it\u2019s alright,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, taking in a deep breath. He supposed it was now or never. \u201cI, um, well at my Bubbe\u2019s funeral, I was showing one of my friends all the different foods, because he didn\u2019t know them, and then I just&hellip;\u201d he paused, shutting his eyes, \u201cand then I just blurted out that I was gay,\u201d</p><p>He really wishes his life was movie that moment; he wanted some sort of music playing in the background, filling the silence. TJ didn\u2019t move his hand from his knee, so at the very least, he wasn\u2019t disgusted, which was nice. He was really starting to enjoy his company.</p><p>\u201cDid he take it well?\u201d he asked softly, and at that Cyrus looked up. TJ had the softest expression on his face, almost like he was too afraid to pry.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 lips twitched a little, almost into a smile. \u201cOh, yeah. He was like \u2018okay, cool\u2019 and then proceeded to continue to ask me about the food,\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled, a pensive expression crossing his face. \u201cI know we don\u2019t know each other that well, and it feels like I just met you but&hellip;thanks. For trusting me enough to say that,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, feeling the tension melt from his body. His shoulders visibly relaxed, and he felt like he could cry tears of joy.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, this is probably the least creative time to say this but,\u201d he paused, puffing out a breath, \u201cI\u2019m gay too,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swore he had the air knocked out of him right then and there. \u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed, pushing his hair back. \u201cDoes that come as a surprise to you?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Cyrus felt his cheeks burn, embarrassed at his question. \u201cNo! I just&hellip;I don\u2019t know I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-didn\u2019t expect me to be gay,\u201d TJ finished with a tiny smile, \u201cit\u2019s okay. I mean, I don\u2019t go around flaunting it. It\u2019s more like \u2018oh yeah by the way\u2019, that kind of thing,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, his head pounding. \u201c&hellip;thanks for telling me,\u201d he mumbled, meeting his gaze.<i> TJ has really nice eyes</i>, he thought, <i>you could get lost in them if you aren\u2019t careful.</i></p><p>TJ didn\u2019t look away from him. Damn, he\u2019d only been here for, what, a week? And he was already falling for one of the competitors. His gaze swept across Cyrus\u2019 features; his cheeks were so red right now, and he wanted to just reach out and cup his face, but that would be weird.</p><p><i>Ding</i>!</p><p>The noise of Cyrus\u2019 phone caused both boys to jolt a little, the soft moment between them gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Andi,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, swiping it unlocked, \u201cshe says people are waiting downstairs to hang out,\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, clearing his throat. As both of them got up and started to make their way downstairs, he couldn\u2019t stop replaying the time they spent together. Maybe, just maybe, things might be different this time.</p>",

He reached for the elevator button, but TJ has the same idea, their fingers brushing each other\u2019s gently. Cyrus froze, hand still hovering by the button before he pressed it. It felt like he and TJ were standing outside the doors forever, but eventually they opened.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d TJ broke the silence, clicking one of the buttons, \u201cwhat do you wanna do?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, leaning back against the handle. \u201cI have cards, if you wanna play,\u201d he offered, and he was greeted with silence, \u201cor\u2026we could do something else,\u201d</p><p>The doors opened at TJ\u2019s floor, and the two of them stepped out. TJ fished the key card out of his pocket and swiped it to unlock the door. He leaned against the frame of the door. \u201cYou\u2019re interesting,\u201d he pointed out, opening the door, \u201cI like that,\u201d</p><p>Before Cyrus could even begin to form a reply to that, TJ was talking again.</p><p>\u201cBy which I mean, I want to get to know you better,\u201d he clarified, taking a seat on the bed, and making room for his guest.</p><p>Cyrus raised a brow at that; nobody was ever that direct with trying to get to know him. He slowly walked towards him, taking a seat on the edge of the bed and bringing his knees into his chest. \u201cWell, what do you wanna know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends, what do you wanna tell me?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, pulling out his phone. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be difficult,\u201d he mumbled, tapping a few times before he let a small smile tug at his lips, \u201chere,\u201d he said, handing TJ his phone.</p><p>\u201cA hundred and one things to ask to get to know someone,\u201d he read, barking a laugh, \u201cyeah, okay, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, feeling a little more at ease. He could do this for a little while.</p><hr><p>\u201cAlright, first question,\u201d TJ started, using his announcer voice, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201clet\u2019s start with something light. If you didn\u2019t need to sleep to survive, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d he hummed. Not exactly what he was expecting. \u201cI guess\u2026probably just watch YouTube videos, or documentaries,\u201d he supplied lamely, ending it with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of documentaries?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was surprised TJ even cared. \u201cMostly one about dinosaurs,\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I\u2019d just, like, take walks. It sounds weird, but there\u2019s nothing like a walk at two in the morning,\u201d</p><p><i>What an ungodly hour</i>, Cyrus thought to himself, offering a soft smile. \u201cThat\u2019s not weird,\u201d he corrected him, \u201cI\u2019d never thought about that. Probably because I end up falling asleep before midnight pretty much every single day,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext question,\u201d TJ continued, \u201cWhen was the last time you climbed a tree?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus bit down on his lip, trying to suppress a giggle. \u201cI uh, I\u2019ve never actually\u2026climbed a tree,\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly dropped the phone, his eyes bugging out of his head. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d he squawked, to which Cyrus nodded, \u201cyou\u2019re missing out, dude. It\u2019s so much fun! You can see so many things when you get up higher,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus put his hand up awkwardly. \u201cAfraid of heights,\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed, slapping a hand on his forehead. Cyrus expected that; a lot of people laughed when he admitted his fears. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean like climb a forty foot tree, Cyrus. I meant, like, ten feet,\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s just so much better,\u201d he teased, \u201cwhen\u2019s the last time you climbed a tree?\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned, remembering the day. \u201cI think I was in, like, middle school. My buddy Lester and I were hanging out and we tried to see who could climb the highest,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cAnd let me guess,\u201d Cyrus began, \u201clike the athlete that you are, you won,\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d he trailed, hesitating a little, \u201cI got a little overconfident and tried to skip a branch, so I fell and broke my arm,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell out of a tree? What are you, like, an acorn?\u201d Cyrus laughed at his own quote. He expected TJ to look at him with a confused face, but instead he lit up.</p><p>\u201cYou like Dear Evan Hansen?\u201d he asked quietly, excitement brimming.</p><p>Cyrus stared at him for a second, blinking once. \u201cI\u2026you know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf <i>course </i>I do, man! It\u2019s one of my favorite musicals,\u201d he exclaimed, shaking his head, \u201cnot many people in my day to day life know about it, so I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d</p><p><i>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here</i>. Cyrus must have repeated those words in his head a few dozen times before he said anything. \u201cNext question,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s something that a lot of people are obsessed with, but you don\u2019t get the hype?\u201d</p><p>And at the same time, both boys cried out, \u201cDuck faces!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed so hard he snorted, not even bothering to feel embarrassed. \u201cWe really are the same people,\u201d he chuckled, carding a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s find some less superficial questions,\u201d he smiled, scrolling down the list, \u201cwhat\u2019s the dumbest thing you\u2019ve done that actually turned out well?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus froze. He knew the answer to the question; he didn\u2019t even have to think about it. But\u2026the thought of saying something now? TJ probably saw that he was visibly uncomfortable, so he put the phone down, placing a hand on the other boy\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You don\u2019t have to answer that, I can pick another-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-no it\u2019s alright,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, taking in a deep breath. He supposed it was now or never. \u201cI, um, well at my Bubbe\u2019s funeral, I was showing one of my friends all the different foods, because he didn\u2019t know them, and then I just\u2026\u201d he paused, shutting his eyes, \u201cand then I just blurted out that I was gay,\u201d</p><p>He really wishes his life was movie that moment; he wanted some sort of music playing in the background, filling the silence. TJ didn\u2019t move his hand from his knee, so at the very least, he wasn\u2019t disgusted, which was nice. He was really starting to enjoy his company.</p><p>\u201cDid he take it well?\u201d he asked softly, and at that Cyrus looked up. TJ had the softest expression on his face, almost like he was too afraid to pry.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 lips twitched a little, almost into a smile. \u201cOh, yeah. He was like \u2018okay, cool\u2019 and then proceeded to continue to ask me about the food,\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled, a pensive expression crossing his face. \u201cI know we don\u2019t know each other that well, and it feels like I just met you but\u2026thanks. For trusting me enough to say that,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, feeling the tension melt from his body. His shoulders visibly relaxed, and he felt like he could cry tears of joy.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, this is probably the least creative time to say this but,\u201d he paused, puffing out a breath, \u201cI\u2019m gay too,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swore he had the air knocked out of him right then and there. \u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed, pushing his hair back. \u201cDoes that come as a surprise to you?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Cyrus felt his cheeks burn, embarrassed at his question. \u201cNo! I just\u2026I don\u2019t know I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-didn\u2019t expect me to be gay,\u201d TJ finished with a tiny smile, \u201cit\u2019s okay. I mean, I don\u2019t go around flaunting it. It\u2019s more like \u2018oh yeah by the way\u2019, that kind of thing,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, his head pounding. \u201c\u2026thanks for telling me,\u201d he mumbled, meeting his gaze.<i> TJ has really nice eyes</i>, he thought, <i>you could get lost in them if you aren\u2019t careful.</i></p><p>TJ didn\u2019t look away from him. Damn, he\u2019d only been here for, what, a week? And he was already falling for one of the competitors. His gaze swept across Cyrus\u2019 features; his cheeks were so red right now, and he wanted to just reach out and cup his face, but that would be weird.</p><p><i>Ding</i>!</p><p>The noise of Cyrus\u2019 phone caused both boys to jolt a little, the soft moment between them gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Andi,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, swiping it unlocked, \u201cshe says people are waiting downstairs to hang out,\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, clearing his throat. As both of them got up and started to make their way downstairs, he couldn\u2019t stop replaying the time they spent together. Maybe, just maybe, things might be different this time.</p></p>",

Blindly, he draped an arm atop the nightstand and winced, shutting off the noise. He squinted at the clock; 7:30. Too early to bother anybody, he supposed. He\u2019d forgotten to turn off his alarm, considering they weren\u2019t shooting today, and there was no way he was going to be able to fall back asleep. He rolled and grabbed his phone, scrolling mindlessly through his Instagram feed. He really missed seeing his friends, even if it was only for a little while. Suddenly he wished he had TJ\u2019s number so he could text him.</p><p>He lay in bed for a little while longer, thinking of possible things to do that day. He had a deck of cards in his bag, which would probably be good for a little while. He figured people would meet him in the lobby when they were ready, so he didn\u2019t bother waiting. Cyrus slowly got out of bed, and made his way to the bathroom to get ready for the day. He changed into a pair of sweatpants and a Queen shirt before he snatched the cards and his phone from his bag.</p><p>The hotel was silent, save for a few clinks downstairs, probably from the breakfast crew. He padded down the hallway, nearly missing the elevator on the way there. He was alone in the elevator, thankfully, tapping his fingers to the beat of the soft music that was playing. Once the doors opened on the lobby floor, he stepped out, and made a right towards the set of couches. He swore he almost choked on his own spit when he rounded the corner.</p><p>TJ was sitting there, hair styled in a way that could only be described as a rat\u2019s nest, and thick-rimmed glasses perched on the bridge of his nose.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen something so pretty in a long time.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said with a wave, snapping TJ out of whatever haze he was in.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey,\u201d he mumbled, scooting over to one side of the couch, \u201cwhy are you here so early?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed at that, taking a seat and sinking into the couch. \u201cI could ask you the same thing,\u201d he pointed out, his gaze flitting from TJ to the fading pattern of the couch.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d TJ said lamely, picking at the skin by his thumb, \u201cwhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026forgot to turn off my alarm,\u201d he admitted, to which TJ broke out into laughter. His laugh was interrupted by snorts, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. <i>Must be really sleep deprived</i>, Cyrus thought.</p><p>\u201cSorry that\u2019s-\u201d he wiped away a tear, a grin still plastered on his face, \u201cthat\u2019s hilarious,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, laugh it up,\u201d Cyrus teased, giving him a light shove, \u201cat least I <i>got </i>some sleep,\u201d</p><p>TJ yawned, as if to prove Cyrus\u2019 point. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he chuckled, shaking his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think the others are going to be awake for a while. You wanna do something? We can hang out in my room, if you want. My mom went out for coffee with some of the other parents,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his insides light up; TJ wanted to hang out with him? \u201cOh, uh, yeah, that sounds\u2026good,\u201d he stammered, attempting to put together a coherent sentence.</p><p>TJ smiled, standing up and nodding in the direction of the elevator. \u201cHope you\u2019re ready for me to bore you to death,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes; what a false statement.

You don\u2019t have to answer that, I can pick another-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-no it\u2019s alright,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, taking in a deep breath. He supposed it was now or never. \u201cI, um, well at my Bubbe\u2019s funeral, I was showing one of my friends all the different foods, because he didn\u2019t know them, and then I just\u2026\u201d he paused, shutting his eyes, \u201cand then I just blurted out that I was gay,\u201d</p><p>He really wishes his life was movie that moment; he wanted some sort of music playing in the background, filling the silence. TJ didn\u2019t move his hand from his knee, so at the very least, he wasn\u2019t disgusted, which was nice. He was really starting to enjoy his company.</p><p>\u201cDid he take it well?\u201d he asked softly, and at that Cyrus looked up. TJ had the softest expression on his face, almost like he was too afraid to pry.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 lips twitched a little, almost into a smile. \u201cOh, yeah. He was like \u2018okay, cool\u2019 and then proceeded to continue to ask me about the food,\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled, a pensive expression crossing his face. \u201cI know we don\u2019t know each other that well, and it feels like I just met you but\u2026thanks. For trusting me enough to say that,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, feeling the tension melt from his body. His shoulders visibly relaxed, and he felt like he could cry tears of joy.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, this is probably the least creative time to say this but,\u201d he paused, puffing out a breath, \u201cI\u2019m gay too,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swore he had the air knocked out of him right then and there. \u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed, pushing his hair back. \u201cDoes that come as a surprise to you?\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Cyrus felt his cheeks burn, embarrassed at his question. \u201cNo! I just\u2026I don\u2019t know I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-didn\u2019t expect me to be gay,\u201d TJ finished with a tiny smile, \u201cit\u2019s okay. I mean, I don\u2019t go around flaunting it. It\u2019s more like \u2018oh yeah by the way\u2019, that kind of thing,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, his head pounding. \u201c\u2026thanks for telling me,\u201d he mumbled, meeting his gaze.<i> TJ has really nice eyes</i>, he thought, <i>you could get lost in them if you aren\u2019t careful.</i></p><p>TJ didn\u2019t look away from him. Damn, he\u2019d only been here for, what, a week? And he was already falling for one of the competitors. His gaze swept across Cyrus\u2019 features; his cheeks were so red right now, and he wanted to just reach out and cup his face, but that would be weird.</p><p><i>Ding</i>!</p><p>The noise of Cyrus\u2019 phone caused both boys to jolt a little, the soft moment between them gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Andi,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, swiping it unlocked, \u201cshe says people are waiting downstairs to hang out,\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, clearing his throat. As both of them got up and started to make their way downstairs, he couldn\u2019t stop replaying the time they spent together. Maybe, just maybe, things might be different this time.</p></p>",

Blindly, he draped an arm atop the nightstand and winced, shutting off the noise. He squinted at the clock; 7:30. Too early to bother anybody, he supposed. He&rsquo;d forgotten to turn off his alarm, considering they weren&rsquo;t shooting today, and there was no way he was going to be able to fall back asleep. He rolled and grabbed his phone, scrolling mindlessly through his Instagram feed. He really missed seeing his friends, even if it was only for a little while. Suddenly he wished he had TJ&rsquo;s number so he could text him.</p><p>He lay in bed for a little while longer, thinking of possible things to do that day. He had a deck of cards in his bag, which would probably be good for a little while. He figured people would meet him in the lobby when they were ready, so he didn&rsquo;t bother waiting. Cyrus slowly got out of bed, and made his way to the bathroom to get ready for the day. He changed into a pair of sweatpants and a Queen shirt before he snatched the cards and his phone from his bag.</p><p>The hotel was silent, save for a few clinks downstairs, probably from the breakfast crew. He padded down the hallway, nearly missing the elevator on the way there. He was alone in the elevator, thankfully, tapping his fingers to the beat of the soft music that was playing. Once the doors opened on the lobby floor, he stepped out, and made a right towards the set of couches. He swore he almost choked on his own spit when he rounded the corner.</p><p>TJ was sitting there, hair styled in a way that could only be described as a rat&rsquo;s nest, and thick-rimmed glasses perched on the bridge of his nose.</p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever seen something so pretty in a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said with a wave, snapping TJ out of whatever haze he was in.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hey,&rdquo; he mumbled, scooting over to one side of the couch, &ldquo;why are you here so early?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed at that, taking a seat and sinking into the couch. &ldquo;I could ask you the same thing,&rdquo; he pointed out, his gaze flitting from TJ to the fading pattern of the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; TJ said lamely, picking at the skin by his thumb, &ldquo;what about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;forgot to turn off my alarm,&rdquo; he admitted, to which TJ broke out into laughter. His laugh was interrupted by snorts, but he couldn&rsquo;t help himself. <i>Must be really sleep deprived</i>, Cyrus thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry that&rsquo;s-&rdquo; he wiped away a tear, a grin still plastered on his face, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s hilarious,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, laugh it up,&rdquo; Cyrus teased, giving him a light shove, &ldquo;at least I <i>got </i>some sleep,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ yawned, as if to prove Cyrus&rsquo; point. &ldquo;Yeah, okay,&rdquo; he chuckled, shaking his head, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the others are going to be awake for a while. You wanna do something? We can hang out in my room, if you want. My mom went out for coffee with some of the other parents,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus felt his insides light up; TJ wanted to hang out with him? &ldquo;Oh, uh, yeah, that sounds&hellip;good,&rdquo; he stammered, attempting to put together a coherent sentence.</p><p>TJ smiled, standing up and nodding in the direction of the elevator. &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re ready for me to bore you to death,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes; what a false statement. He reached for the elevator button, but TJ has the same idea, their fingers brushing each other&rsquo;s gently. Cyrus froze, hand still hovering by the button before he pressed it. It felt like he and TJ were standing outside the doors forever, but eventually they opened.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; TJ broke the silence, clicking one of the buttons, &ldquo;what do you wanna do?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, leaning back against the handle. &ldquo;I have cards, if you wanna play,&rdquo; he offered, and he was greeted with silence, &ldquo;or&hellip;we could do something else,&rdquo;</p><p>The doors opened at TJ&rsquo;s floor, and the two of them stepped out. TJ fished the key card out of his pocket and swiped it to unlock the door. He leaned against the frame of the door. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re interesting,&rdquo; he pointed out, opening the door, &ldquo;I like that,&rdquo;</p><p>Before Cyrus could even begin to form a reply to that, TJ was talking again.</p><p>&ldquo;By which I mean, I want to get to know you better,&rdquo; he clarified, taking a seat on the bed, and making room for his guest.</p><p>Cyrus raised a brow at that; nobody was ever that direct with trying to get to know him. He slowly walked towards him, taking a seat on the edge of the bed and bringing his knees into his chest. &ldquo;Well, what do you wanna know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That depends, what do you wanna tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighed, pulling out his phone. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to be difficult,&rdquo; he mumbled, tapping a few times before he let a small smile tug at his lips, &ldquo;here,&rdquo; he said, handing TJ his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;A hundred and one things to ask to get to know someone,&rdquo; he read, barking a laugh, &ldquo;yeah, okay, let&rsquo;s go with this,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled, feeling a little more at ease. He could do this for a little while.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Alright, first question,&rdquo; TJ started, using his announcer voice, and Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s start with something light. If you didn&rsquo;t need to sleep to survive, what would you do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; he hummed. Not exactly what he was expecting. &ldquo;I guess&hellip;probably just watch YouTube videos, or documentaries,&rdquo; he supplied lamely, ending it with a shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of documentaries?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was surprised TJ even cared. &ldquo;Mostly one about dinosaurs,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d just, like, take walks. It sounds weird, but there&rsquo;s nothing like a walk at two in the morning,&rdquo;</p><p><i>What an ungodly hour</i>, Cyrus thought to himself, offering a soft smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not weird,&rdquo; he corrected him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never thought about that. Probably because I end up falling asleep before midnight pretty much every single day,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next question,&rdquo; TJ continued, &ldquo;When was the last time you climbed a tree?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus bit down on his lip, trying to suppress a giggle. &ldquo;I uh, I&rsquo;ve never actually&hellip;climbed a tree,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nearly dropped the phone, his eyes bugging out of his head. &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; he squawked, to which Cyrus nodded, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re missing out, dude. It&rsquo;s so much fun! You can see so many things when you get up higher,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus put his hand up awkwardly. &ldquo;Afraid of heights,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughed, slapping a hand on his forehead. Cyrus expected that; a lot of people laughed when he admitted his fears. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean like climb a forty foot tree, Cyrus. I meant, like, ten feet,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, that&rsquo;s just so much better,&rdquo; he teased, &ldquo;when&rsquo;s the last time you climbed a tree?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ grinned, remembering the day. &ldquo;I think I was in, like, middle school. My buddy Lester and I were hanging out and we tried to see who could climb the highest,&rdquo; he said proudly.</p><p>&ldquo;And let me guess,&rdquo; Cyrus began, &ldquo;like the athlete that you are, you won,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed, hesitating a little, &ldquo;I got a little overconfident and tried to skip a branch, so I fell and broke my arm,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You fell out of a tree? What are you, like, an acorn?&rdquo; Cyrus laughed at his own quote. He expected TJ to look at him with a confused face, but instead he lit up.</p><p>&ldquo;You like Dear Evan Hansen?&rdquo; he asked quietly, excitement brimming.</p><p>Cyrus stared at him for a second, blinking once. &ldquo;I&hellip;you know it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of <i>course </i>I do, man! It&rsquo;s one of my favorite musicals,&rdquo; he exclaimed, shaking his head, &ldquo;not many people in my day to day life know about it, so I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo;</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here</i>. Cyrus must have repeated those words in his head a few dozen times before he said anything. &ldquo;Next question,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s something that a lot of people are obsessed with, but you don&rsquo;t get the hype?&rdquo;</p><p>And at the same time, both boys cried out, &ldquo;Duck faces!&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed so hard he snorted, not even bothering to feel embarrassed. &ldquo;We really are the same people,&rdquo; he chuckled, carding a hand through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, let&rsquo;s find some less superficial questions,&rdquo; he smiled, scrolling down the list, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the dumbest thing you&rsquo;ve done that actually turned out well?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus froze. He knew the answer to the question; he didn&rsquo;t even have to think about it. But&hellip;the thought of saying something now? TJ probably saw that he was visibly uncomfortable, so he put the phone down, placing a hand on the other boy&rsquo;s knee.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay? You don&rsquo;t have to answer that, I can pick another-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-no it&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; he said through gritted teeth, taking in a deep breath.

So I doubt the cast feels that any of the stories are unsatisfying - but rather that they <i>understand\u00a0</i>the potential their characters and stories have if they were given the chance to continue. So like, Cyrus and TJ will have a satisfying ending&hellip; but Luke is aware of how much potential the pairing would have if they were able to continue their story beyond that.
