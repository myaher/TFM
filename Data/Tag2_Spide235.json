It can be your greatest weakness if used\nagainst you.\u201d Peter sighs, but lets him continue. \u201cEnough creatures and people\nwant you dead, simply because you are good, simply because you run around with\nthat idiotic band of heroes. You need to perfect this for when it really\nmatters.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou hang around with those idiots too.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYes, but others want me dead for other reasons.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we are not discussing that. We\u2019re trying to focus on you. On\nkeeping you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make it fun? This isn\u2019t exactly Street Fighter\u2026. Can you at least make it more\nchallenging for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenging?\u201d Loki\u2019s eyebrow rose in question. \u201cWhat more do you\nwant me to throw at you? I don\u2019t care to find out how Stark will react if I\nsquash you like the bug you dress up as.\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes so intensely that Loki wondered for a moment\nif perhaps they\u2019re not related somehow.</p><p>\u201cOkay. So, maybe stop sending hallucinations and magic my way.\nMaybe something bigger like huge rocks or cars?\u201d Peter suggests with wild hand\nmotions as he continues to describe various ridiculous scenarios, each crazier\nthan the last.</p><p>Loki\u2019s mood swiftly changes from concern to irritation.</p><p><b>\u201cAre you\neven listening?\u201d</b> Peter asks, waving a hand in front of Loki\u2019s\nface. <br/></p><p><b>\u201cYes, it\njust takes me a while to process so much stupid all at once.\u201d</b> Loki\nsighs, trying to formulate a plan that will appease Peter and teach him what he\nneeds to know. \u201cCars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCars.\u201d Peter nods, hope alight in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAlright. We\u2019ll start out slowly. I want you to try something\ndifferent each time. And if you even <i>look</i>\nlike you might be hurt. We\u2019re done with the cars. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Peter laughs. \u201cYou know Steve trapped me under a huge\nmetal container once, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was awesome.\u201d</p><p>Loki looks on in disbelief as Peter pulls his mask on and swings\noff the roof top, down to a large derelict parking lot below.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some junker cars that have been here for years that we\ncan use!\u201d Peter calls up to Loki.</p><p>Loki appears behind Peter in a green mist making him jump.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to dodge cars.\u201d Loki laughs at his surprise.</p><p>\u201cIf you can dodge a car you can dodge a ball.\u201d Peter mumbles and\ntakes a crouched stance. \u201cOkay, Mr. Loki, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Loki sighs, squaring his shoulders before flinging out an arm\ntowards Peter. This time, instead of illusions of large creatures coming at\nhim, a rusty pick up goes flying towards him. Peter easily dodges it, slinging\nout a web to catch the truck and flings it back at Loki.</p><p>Loki chuckles as green swirls of magic radiate from his hands\nsplitting the truck in two and sending both pieces back towards Peter.</p><p>Peter shrieks in glee dodging one half of the truck and flinging\nthe other to the ground, landing in front of it and motioning with both hands for\nanother car.</p><p>Loki sends a large van his way and Peter flings it back to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Something different. If you constantly use the same\ntechniques, you become predictable and can be easily defeated. Remember I\u2019m\ntrying to kill you, not stop you.\u201d Loki says, picking up a small compact car. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Peter tries a different maneuver, falling half way through, and\nrolling to land awkwardly on his feet but still managing to avoid the car.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I try it like this?\u201d He asks himself out loud, motioning\nfor Loki to throw another car his way.</p><p>He goes again. This time bouncing off a wall.</p><p>\u201cAm I doing good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. Do you need another challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stop going easy on me.\u201d Peter shouts over the crash of the\nlatest car being thrown into the ground.</p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019re ready for it.\u201d Loki smirks, enjoying the\nboy\u2019s energy, skill, and intuition.</p><p>He flings one car from in front of Peter, then one from the side.\nPeter uses his webs to deflect the first and pull himself out of the way of the\nsecond. As quick as Peter is, he\u2019s no match for Loki\u2019s magic, as car after car\ncome near him. Some thrown at him, some to distract him.</p><p>He dodges one, then another. A roll here. A web there. Then\nnothing.</p><hr><p>Peter hears birds chirping and feels a slight breeze on his face. Blinking\nhis eyes open, he looks around and realizes that he\u2019s flat on his back with\nLoki lying next to him aimlessly picking at his nails to his side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy are we laying\ndown in a parking lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay that I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you hit the wall over there and went\nunconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s where things get blurry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I lied down next to you so everyone would think\nwe\u2019re just \u2018chilling\u2019 as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out for a while: I got bored and tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d Loki sighs, looking over to Peter. \u201cBut we\u2019re done\nfor the day. And you\u2019re going to the healers once we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Mr. Loki. You\u2019re pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome, young Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best babysitter Mr. Stark\u2019s set up for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is babysitting you my\u2026 By the Norns, that is exactly\nmy job.\u201d</p><hr><p>From across the street, Venom sits atop a window ledge perched\nprecariously, his head tilted to the side in curious speculation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat a bunch of losers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really Loki? With that Spider Boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe so.\u201d Venom pauses with a sigh. \u201cIf anything where to\nhappen to either of them, we will eat everyone in sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe will eat everyone!\u201d</p><p>Eddie sighs, \u201cBut Loki \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cEveryone!\u201d</p><p>Eddie concedes after a long pause. \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Venom watches as Loki helps Peter stand.</p><p>\u201cSnacks. Snacks as far as we can see!\u201d He murmurs, jumping off the\nwindow ledge. </p><hr><p><b>Tags:<br/>Let me know if you want on or off the tag lists! \u2764</b></p><p><b>Everything:<br/></b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkDWJ9FuDSRMEqYldFsUMw\" target=\"_blank\">@midnightsinger</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msc-WADbwvdt53X2Eel73Fg\" target=\"_blank\">@mee2themoo</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2jczbCUawhW6ZKqEBbqphw\" target=\"_blank\">@machimaquiaveli</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\" target=\"_blank\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdsN2t--kBpgalrI52yS2Lg\" target=\"_blank\">@pegasusdragontiger</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzIFq2SP9qH0_U6NNntvAEw\" target=\"_blank\">@reading-in-moonlight</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMLGmB4c8P8KZI_9dwIulpg\" target=\"_blank\">@theshellcollecter</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjoKvELRUkUdaTFmQ4UY5ew\" target=\"_blank\">@heartbreaker6995</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMQ6hIcqAzPYaS5u2-lqeEw\" target=\"_blank\">@a-kiddo-with-a-doggo</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mArDVOdNg6NL31pCQZOEb7Q\" target=\"_blank\">@frostymoon11</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSIdZN0n-p5Ier4AIWGkZtg\" target=\"_blank\">@seibelsays</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW4xtkQrXjm6WxRBS6S0oA\" target=\"_blank\">@el-eldritch</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN71QHPHk3tESSogXxFP4_g\" target=\"_blank\">@apocalypticwafflekitten</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myEUKMM5zuRZIa9gH2IvfvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@m4df4n</a>\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvk8HVRaKOaOvZNj0UiPrgg\" target=\"_blank\">@your-pixels-are-showing</a>\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\" target=\"_blank\">@redqueen1221</a>\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLso-5CADkugfHmYVE1QWRw\" target=\"_blank\">@arielletheavenger</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnsJwZ8ae15erbhtE2JVhTA\" target=\"_blank\">@sea040561</a>\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><b>Loki:</b><br/><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZn5PmoQN_aXdM8uWazM9XQ\" target=\"_blank\">@loki-the-fox</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb75jNO1vwfxPa9iYdyKpxA\" target=\"_blank\">@lovelyangelofasgard</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msBMZ3X0Y9S5Jfn39uxOAuw\" target=\"_blank\">@lokiloveforever</a>\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNnZMO_dnLG0r8YnrzmI3iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@deyhra</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr2Oo7e9ovn-slQOa6MZj7g\" target=\"_blank\">@omgopalsapphire</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWP2SmhSYFiw1WssoQ4vRxw\" target=\"_blank\">@drakesfiance</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2KkI2SMLVAS6bcVo3OKLqQ\" target=\"_blank\">@quitesmolcreature</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maGXq6I3u6ntndOHA93lpFw\" target=\"_blank\">@drakelover78</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpbDQ4ixXCchnjDYqoxRkCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@foreverdrivinginpuddles123</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVu0nbbHZEuX4YdAAHOxEag\" target=\"_blank\">@krystynespider</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSLQnj5U9bJe1wqSwujY7dw\" target=\"_blank\">@dystopian-dez382</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzEc_iW2PUaI-gjZv9PxfA\" target=\"_blank\">@wrappedinlokisarms</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBOzTtetGwL8iED5FFWOJtQ\" target=\"_blank\">@moonfaery</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF9vAkjL9o-1ksPHeivoD4A\" target=\"_blank\">@lokis-sunflower-anna</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdr9j8nAQCXZH6kqXFVjyoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@minnie-marvel</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq7CMNMlD1g-guHGrrWiFaA\" target=\"_blank\">@curlyhair-in-japan</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mobEEDPn65GaBB8jLNMWaFg\" target=\"_blank\">@meyoko10</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS14l90uggI6ojKa1F6PtgQ\" target=\"_blank\">@bambamwolf87</a>\u00a0 .</p>",

We\u2019re trying to focus on you. On\nkeeping you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make it fun? This isn\u2019t exactly Street Fighter\u2026. Can you at least make it more\nchallenging for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenging?\u201d Loki\u2019s eyebrow rose in question. \u201cWhat more do you\nwant me to throw at you? I don\u2019t care to find out how Stark will react if I\nsquash you like the bug you dress up as.\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes so intensely that Loki wondered for a moment\nif perhaps they\u2019re not related somehow.</p><p>\u201cOkay. So, maybe stop sending hallucinations and magic my way.\nMaybe something bigger like huge rocks or cars?\u201d Peter suggests with wild hand\nmotions as he continues to describe various ridiculous scenarios, each crazier\nthan the last.</p><p>Loki\u2019s mood swiftly changes from concern to irritation.</p><p><b>\u201cAre you\neven listening?\u201d</b> Peter asks, waving a hand in front of Loki\u2019s\nface. <br></p><p><b>\u201cYes, it\njust takes me a while to process so much stupid all at once.\u201d</b> Loki\nsighs, trying to formulate a plan that will appease Peter and teach him what he\nneeds to know. \u201cCars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCars.\u201d Peter nods, hope alight in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAlright. We\u2019ll start out slowly. I want you to try something\ndifferent each time. And if you even <i>look</i>\nlike you might be hurt. We\u2019re done with the cars. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Peter laughs. \u201cYou know Steve trapped me under a huge\nmetal container once, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was awesome.\u201d</p><p>Loki looks on in disbelief as Peter pulls his mask on and swings\noff the roof top, down to a large derelict parking lot below.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some junker cars that have been here for years that we\ncan use!\u201d Peter calls up to Loki.</p><p>Loki appears behind Peter in a green mist making him jump.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to dodge cars.\u201d Loki laughs at his surprise.</p><p>\u201cIf you can dodge a car you can dodge a ball.\u201d Peter mumbles and\ntakes a crouched stance. \u201cOkay, Mr. Loki, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Loki sighs, squaring his shoulders before flinging out an arm\ntowards Peter. This time, instead of illusions of large creatures coming at\nhim, a rusty pick up goes flying towards him. Peter easily dodges it, slinging\nout a web to catch the truck and flings it back at Loki.</p><p>Loki chuckles as green swirls of magic radiate from his hands\nsplitting the truck in two and sending both pieces back towards Peter.</p><p>Peter shrieks in glee dodging one half of the truck and flinging\nthe other to the ground, landing in front of it and motioning with both hands for\nanother car.</p><p>Loki sends a large van his way and Peter flings it back to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Something different. If you constantly use the same\ntechniques, you become predictable and can be easily defeated. Remember I\u2019m\ntrying to kill you, not stop you.\u201d Loki says, picking up a small compact car. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Peter tries a different maneuver, falling half way through, and\nrolling to land awkwardly on his feet but still managing to avoid the car.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I try it like this?\u201d He asks himself out loud, motioning\nfor Loki to throw another car his way.</p><p>He goes again. This time bouncing off a wall.</p><p>\u201cAm I doing good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. Do you need another challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stop going easy on me.\u201d Peter shouts over the crash of the\nlatest car being thrown into the ground.</p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019re ready for it.\u201d Loki smirks, enjoying the\nboy\u2019s energy, skill, and intuition.</p><p>He flings one car from in front of Peter, then one from the side.\nPeter uses his webs to deflect the first and pull himself out of the way of the\nsecond. As quick as Peter is, he\u2019s no match for Loki\u2019s magic, as car after car\ncome near him. Some thrown at him, some to distract him.</p><p>He dodges one, then another. A roll here. A web there. Then\nnothing.</p><hr><p>Peter hears birds chirping and feels a slight breeze on his face. Blinking\nhis eyes open, he looks around and realizes that he\u2019s flat on his back with\nLoki lying next to him aimlessly picking at his nails to his side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy are we laying\ndown in a parking lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay that I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you hit the wall over there and went\nunconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s where things get blurry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I lied down next to you so everyone would think\nwe\u2019re just \u2018chilling\u2019 as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out for a while: I got bored and tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d Loki sighs, looking over to Peter. \u201cBut we\u2019re done\nfor the day. And you\u2019re going to the healers once we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Mr. Loki. You\u2019re pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome, young Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best babysitter Mr. Stark\u2019s set up for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is babysitting you my\u2026 By the Norns, that is exactly\nmy job.\u201d</p><hr><p>From across the street, Venom sits atop a window ledge perched\nprecariously, his head tilted to the side in curious speculation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat a bunch of losers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really Loki? With that Spider Boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe so.\u201d Venom pauses with a sigh. \u201cIf anything where to\nhappen to either of them, we will eat everyone in sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe will eat everyone!\u201d</p><p>Eddie sighs, \u201cBut Loki \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cEveryone!\u201d</p><p>Eddie concedes after a long pause. \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Venom watches as Loki helps Peter stand.</p><p>\u201cSnacks. Snacks as far as we can see!\u201d He murmurs, jumping off the\nwindow ledge. </p><hr><p><b>Tags:<br>Let me know if you want on or off the tag lists! \u2764</b></p><p><b>Everything:<br></b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkDWJ9FuDSRMEqYldFsUMw\" target=\"_blank\">@midnightsinger</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msc-WADbwvdt53X2Eel73Fg\" target=\"_blank\">@mee2themoo</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2jczbCUawhW6ZKqEBbqphw\" target=\"_blank\">@machimaquiaveli</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\" target=\"_blank\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdsN2t--kBpgalrI52yS2Lg\" target=\"_blank\">@pegasusdragontiger</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzIFq2SP9qH0_U6NNntvAEw\" target=\"_blank\">@reading-in-moonlight</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMLGmB4c8P8KZI_9dwIulpg\" target=\"_blank\">@theshellcollecter</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjoKvELRUkUdaTFmQ4UY5ew\" target=\"_blank\">@heartbreaker6995</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMQ6hIcqAzPYaS5u2-lqeEw\" target=\"_blank\">@a-kiddo-with-a-doggo</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mArDVOdNg6NL31pCQZOEb7Q\" target=\"_blank\">@frostymoon11</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSIdZN0n-p5Ier4AIWGkZtg\" target=\"_blank\">@seibelsays</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW4xtkQrXjm6WxRBS6S0oA\" target=\"_blank\">@el-eldritch</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN71QHPHk3tESSogXxFP4_g\" target=\"_blank\">@apocalypticwafflekitten</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myEUKMM5zuRZIa9gH2IvfvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@m4df4n</a>\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvk8HVRaKOaOvZNj0UiPrgg\" target=\"_blank\">@your-pixels-are-showing</a>\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\" target=\"_blank\">@redqueen1221</a>\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLso-5CADkugfHmYVE1QWRw\" target=\"_blank\">@arielletheavenger</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnsJwZ8ae15erbhtE2JVhTA\" target=\"_blank\">@sea040561</a>\u00a0\u00a0<br><br><b>Loki:</b><br><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZn5PmoQN_aXdM8uWazM9XQ\" target=\"_blank\">@loki-the-fox</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb75jNO1vwfxPa9iYdyKpxA\" target=\"_blank\">@lovelyangelofasgard</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msBMZ3X0Y9S5Jfn39uxOAuw\" target=\"_blank\">@lokiloveforever</a>\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNnZMO_dnLG0r8YnrzmI3iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@deyhra</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr2Oo7e9ovn-slQOa6MZj7g\" target=\"_blank\">@omgopalsapphire</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWP2SmhSYFiw1WssoQ4vRxw\" target=\"_blank\">@drakesfiance</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2KkI2SMLVAS6bcVo3OKLqQ\" target=\"_blank\">@quitesmolcreature</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maGXq6I3u6ntndOHA93lpFw\" target=\"_blank\">@drakelover78</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpbDQ4ixXCchnjDYqoxRkCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@foreverdrivinginpuddles123</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVu0nbbHZEuX4YdAAHOxEag\" target=\"_blank\">@krystynespider</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSLQnj5U9bJe1wqSwujY7dw\" target=\"_blank\">@dystopian-dez382</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzEc_iW2PUaI-gjZv9PxfA\" target=\"_blank\">@wrappedinlokisarms</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBOzTtetGwL8iED5FFWOJtQ\" target=\"_blank\">@moonfaery</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF9vAkjL9o-1ksPHeivoD4A\" target=\"_blank\">@lokis-sunflower-anna</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdr9j8nAQCXZH6kqXFVjyoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@minnie-marvel</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq7CMNMlD1g-guHGrrWiFaA\" target=\"_blank\">@curlyhair-in-japan</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mobEEDPn65GaBB8jLNMWaFg\" target=\"_blank\">@meyoko10</a>\u00a0 .\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS14l90uggI6ojKa1F6PtgQ\" target=\"_blank\">@bambamwolf87</a>\u00a0 .</p>",

So, maybe stop sending hallucinations and magic my way.\nMaybe something bigger like huge rocks or cars?\u201d Peter suggests with wild hand\nmotions as he continues to describe various ridiculous scenarios, each crazier\nthan the last.</p><p>Loki\u2019s mood swiftly changes from concern to irritation.</p><p><b>\u201cAre you\neven listening?\u201d</b> Peter asks, waving a hand in front of Loki\u2019s\nface. <br></p><p><b>\u201cYes, it\njust takes me a while to process so much stupid all at once.\u201d</b> Loki\nsighs, trying to formulate a plan that will appease Peter and teach him what he\nneeds to know. \u201cCars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCars.\u201d Peter nods, hope alight in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAlright. We\u2019ll start out slowly. I want you to try something\ndifferent each time. And if you even <i>look</i>\nlike you might be hurt. We\u2019re done with the cars. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Peter laughs. \u201cYou know Steve trapped me under a huge\nmetal container once, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was awesome.\u201d</p><p>Loki looks on in disbelief as Peter pulls his mask on and swings\noff the roof top, down to a large derelict parking lot below.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some junker cars that have been here for years that we\ncan use!\u201d Peter calls up to Loki.</p><p>Loki appears behind Peter in a green mist making him jump.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to dodge cars.\u201d Loki laughs at his surprise.</p><p>\u201cIf you can dodge a car you can dodge a ball.\u201d Peter mumbles and\ntakes a crouched stance. \u201cOkay, Mr. Loki, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Loki sighs, squaring his shoulders before flinging out an arm\ntowards Peter. This time, instead of illusions of large creatures coming at\nhim, a rusty pick up goes flying towards him. Peter easily dodges it, slinging\nout a web to catch the truck and flings it back at Loki.</p><p>Loki chuckles as green swirls of magic radiate from his hands\nsplitting the truck in two and sending both pieces back towards Peter.</p><p>Peter shrieks in glee dodging one half of the truck and flinging\nthe other to the ground, landing in front of it and motioning with both hands for\nanother car.</p><p>Loki sends a large van his way and Peter flings it back to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Something different. If you constantly use the same\ntechniques, you become predictable and can be easily defeated. Remember I\u2019m\ntrying to kill you, not stop you.\u201d Loki says, picking up a small compact car. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Peter tries a different maneuver, falling half way through, and\nrolling to land awkwardly on his feet but still managing to avoid the car.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I try it like this?\u201d He asks himself out loud, motioning\nfor Loki to throw another car his way.</p><p>He goes again. This time bouncing off a wall.</p><p>\u201cAm I doing good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. Do you need another challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stop going easy on me.\u201d Peter shouts over the crash of the\nlatest car being thrown into the ground.</p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019re ready for it.\u201d Loki smirks, enjoying the\nboy\u2019s energy, skill, and intuition.</p><p>He flings one car from in front of Peter, then one from the side.\nPeter uses his webs to deflect the first and pull himself out of the way of the\nsecond. As quick as Peter is, he\u2019s no match for Loki\u2019s magic, as car after car\ncome near him. Some thrown at him, some to distract him.</p><p>He dodges one, then another. A roll here. A web there. Then\nnothing.</p><hr><p>Peter hears birds chirping and feels a slight breeze on his face. Blinking\nhis eyes open, he looks around and realizes that he\u2019s flat on his back with\nLoki lying next to him aimlessly picking at his nails to his side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy are we laying\ndown in a parking lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay that I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you hit the wall over there and went\nunconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s where things get blurry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I lied down next to you so everyone would think\nwe\u2019re just \u2018chilling\u2019 as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out for a while: I got bored and tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d Loki sighs, looking over to Peter. \u201cBut we\u2019re done\nfor the day. And you\u2019re going to the healers once we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Mr. Loki. You\u2019re pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome, young Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best babysitter Mr. Stark\u2019s set up for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is babysitting you my\u2026 By the Norns, that is exactly\nmy job.\u201d</p><hr><p>From across the street, Venom sits atop a window ledge perched\nprecariously, his head tilted to the side in curious speculation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat a bunch of losers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really Loki? With that Spider Boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe so.\u201d Venom pauses with a sigh. \u201cIf anything where to\nhappen to either of them, we will eat everyone in sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe will eat everyone!\u201d</p><p>Eddie sighs, \u201cBut Loki \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cEveryone!\u201d</p><p>Eddie concedes after a long pause. \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Venom watches as Loki helps Peter stand.</p><p>\u201cSnacks.

Sorry to have this hang for such a long time. I\u2019ve just been really busy with work stuff as well as stuff in my personal life.

As they navigated through the maze the was the New Avengers Facility, Peter glanced around, seeing the various Androids at work. After weeks of doing his routes, he could recognize and name just about all of them. There was <i>Ruby</i>, a custodian Android, peacefully mopping the floor. And then there was <i>Justin</i> and <i>Lauretta</i>, a couple of lab technician Androids, strolling down the hall in the opposite direction. All three of them took time to say hello to Peter - completely ignoring his suit.</p><p>\tAgain the idea of deviancy fluttered into Peter&rsquo;s head. It was like a headache that just wouldn&rsquo;t pass. While he waved back to the Androids, his mask was hiding a quiet frown. What was it about deviancy that was so bad? He knew that some deviants had hurt people before, but people also hurt people. And what causes the phenomenon? Could Ruby end up becoming a deviant? Could Justin or Lauretta? What about Rebekah? What about&hellip;<i>(Y/N)</i>? That last thought lingered in Peter&rsquo;s head like an echo in a cave, trailing back deep into his mind where it couldn&rsquo;t be forgotten.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; (Y/N) spoke up, snapping Peter out of his thoughts.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Y-Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You seem a little quiet. Is there anything you&rsquo;d like to talk about?&rdquo; (Y/N) sounded concerned - but again this upset Peter. Could (Y/N) even <i>be</i> concerned. These thoughts just made Peter more and more confused - and frankly a little sad. He did his best to ignore them.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m just a little nervous about potentially running into that jerk Greggor.&rdquo; He lied.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; (Y/N) took the package from Peter&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;If we see him before we see Rebekah, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> handle any interactions, so you don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t hafta do that.&rdquo; The memory of Dr. Greggor shoving (Y/N) to the floor flashed through his mind. He didn&rsquo;t want that to happen again - or god forbid, something worse. But (Y/N) just smiled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be alright, Peter,&rdquo; he did his best to assuage any of Peter&rsquo;s fears, &ldquo;But it means a lot you care about my wellbeing. Thank you.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s cheeks flushed under his mask once again. His frown curled just enough to form into a smile. He came to the conclusion that the muddy details didn&rsquo;t matter. Human or not, (Y/N) was his friend, and he cared about him. That was enough.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"256\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4749707f373cf3f3454d36742a5a08c/tumblr_inline_php3xll9LI1twut1a_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"256\"/></figure><p>Eventually, the two arrived at the entrance to Hangar 08. Through the glass windows, Peter could see Rebekah just now strolling up to Dr. Greggor. The hangar was empty and dark. It hadn&rsquo;t looked like this particular area had been used by anyone in a while. Peter squinted through his lenses - now with their night vision activated - to confirm that it <i>was</i>, in fact, Dr. Greggor in the shadows.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter? They&rsquo;re right there. Shouldn&rsquo;t we deliver the package?&rdquo; (Y/N) asked innocently, but Peter nudged him to the side, just out of view.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s funny, Greggor - a medical doctor - is hanging out in an abandoned hangar?&rdquo; Peter whispered to (Y/N), whose LED now flickered yellow as he thought about the suspicious scenario.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but&ndash;&rdquo; (Y/N) began.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just wait a second. I want to see what this is all about. It might be nothing.&rdquo; Peter interrupted, now leaning close against the glass. As he tapped into his super-hearing, he could make out both Rebekah&rsquo;s and Greggor&rsquo;s voices out perfectly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Dr. Greggor.&rdquo; Rebekah addressed him with a professional and happy tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you bring it?&rdquo; The doctor sounded irritated, not at all welcoming to Rebekah.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; She began going through the packages in her arms, &ldquo;I followed the same instructions you gave to the other delivery Androids. All packages addressed to you are to be delivered to you <i>here</i> at Hangar 08.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now <i>that</i> sounds suspicious, right?&rdquo; Peter asked under his breath. He glanced back at (Y/N) who gave a simple nod, his LED flickering yellow as he too was confused about what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;One moment, sir.&rdquo; Rebekah went through the packages again, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to find it. I know it was here. I marked it down once it came into the&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, just let me do it!&rdquo; Dr. Greggor violently swiped the packages from her hands, casting them aside once he saw the names listed were not his own. He began to pant as he flipped through the last remaining envelopes.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Greggor, are you alright?&rdquo; Rebekah stepped forward as she examined the man, &ldquo;You seem agitated. You don&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;re in good health.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Agitated</i>?,&rdquo; He grunted, his hands tightly squeezing into fists, &ldquo;You <i>lost</i> my <i>shit</i>, of course I&rsquo;m agitated!&rdquo; He began to shout. Peter realized he no longer needed to use his powers to hear the man. He was angry - <i>furious</i> even, but why?</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip; have dust on your collar, sir.&rdquo; Rebekah reached out to touch the doctor&rsquo;s shirt, but he quickly recoiled with disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> fucking touch me!&rdquo; Greggor barked.</p><p>&ldquo;Dust?&rdquo; Peter muttered softly to himself - slowly putting the pieces together in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what is it?&rdquo; (Y/N) asked. Peter didn&rsquo;t reply, but instead took the envelope from (Y/N)&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I just need to see something,&rdquo; Peter tore open the sealed envelope and reached inside, pulling out the contents - a collection of small individually wrapped bags of a red crystalline substance, &ldquo;This is&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Red Ice.&rdquo; (Y/N) finished his sentence. Peter&rsquo;s face was that of pure horror. All the color drained from his cheeks once he finally grasped what it was he was holding. Illegal drugs - Red Ice of all things. Red Ice was currently a big deal in Detroit, but he didn&rsquo;t realize it had begun reaching other cities. The two remained quiet, looking back to Dr. Greggor and Rebekah.</p><p>&ldquo;My scans&hellip;&rdquo; Rebekah&rsquo;s LED flickered yellow as she scanned the dust. She was silent for just a moment until suddenly her eyes became very concerned, &ldquo;&hellip;detect traces of Acetone, Lithium, Thirium, Toluene, and Hydrochloric Acid&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Bitch!&rdquo; his head snapped in her direction, sweat starting to drip down his face, &ldquo;Where did you put my shit?!&rdquo; With a firm hand, the doctor slapped Rebekah across the face, sending her to the floor.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"234\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0c8dff3458a375a5f62286626e8d109/tumblr_inline_php3y8HlmJ1twut1a_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"234\"/></figure><p>That was their cue. Without another second passing, Peter swung into the hangar at full speed, (Y/N) close behind. (Y/N) hurried to Rebekah&rsquo;s side, her LED now rapidly blinking red as she scrambled into his arms. Peter wasted no time storming up to the doctor. Up close he looked awful - sick even. His eyes were bloodshot, his complexion was pale, he was beginning to sweat profusely, and he just looked so unbelievably angry.</p><p>&ldquo;You hit a girl! What&rsquo;s wrong with you?!&rdquo; Peter waved his finger in Greggor&rsquo;s face - like a parent chastising a child.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> isn&rsquo;t a girl!&rdquo; The doctor swatted Peter&rsquo;s hand away and pointed at Rebekah on the floor - still clinging to (Y/N), &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a heaping sack of bolts, metal, and Thirium!&rdquo; He started to lunge at the two Androids on the ground - both fists clenched tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave her alone!&rdquo; Peter stepped in front of him, holding him away from the two. Peter didn&rsquo;t want to use his powers - he didn&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone, but Dr. Greggor was clearly dangerous.</p><p>Rebekah and (Y/N) slowly got to their feet while Peter did his best to keep their attacker at bay. It didn&rsquo;t take long for things to get out of hand. Dr. Greggor swung his leg - kneeing Peter painfully in his stomach. Peter went down, hard. Seeing this sent Rebekah into a frenzy. With her LED now a bright and solid red, she quickly ran from (Y/N)&rsquo;s side, fleeing the room in tears. The doctor kicked Peter while he was down - literally, in the same spot. Behind the mask, Peter let out a painful gasp as Greggor&rsquo;s boot made contact. (Y/N) stepped forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay out of this, Tin Man!&rdquo; Greggor screamed. (Y/N) obeyed - clearly distressed about what was going on. His LED blinked from yellow to red as his eyes fell to his friend in a heap on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Always the sidekick, never the hero,&rdquo; Dr. Greggor turned to the young man, bending down to stare daggers directly into his eyes, &ldquo;I know where I stand amongst the Avengers. <i>You</i>? With or without powers, you&rsquo;re just a dumb kid. They don&rsquo;t need you.&rdquo; Peter finally got himself up, his lenses tight as he glared at the man above him. As Dr. Greggor raised his fist for another blow on Peter, Peter did the same - prepared to put an end to this altercation at whatever cost.</p><p>But suddenly, it was (Y/N) who had his hands around Dr. Greggor&rsquo;s collar. Before anyone could react, the sound of the doctor&rsquo;s body hitting the ground echoed throughout the hangar. (Y/N) stood over him, now with both hands around the doctor&rsquo;s neck as his LED beamed red. He remained silent through it all, but his eyes said enough. He looked beyond infuriated - and it actually began to scare Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Hey! Get&hellip;off&hellip;me!&rdquo; Dr. Greggor flailed about as he struggled to breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) Stop! That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; Peter stood and ran to the two men on the ground,\u00a0placing his hands firmly on (Y/N)&rsquo;s shoulders, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna kill him!&rdquo; It was no use. (Y/N) continued to squeeze - ignoring Peter&rsquo;s pleas. Soon Dr. Greggor began to turn blue in the face and his voice began to fade into quiet gurgles.</p><p>&ldquo;I said that&rsquo;s <i>enough</i>!&rdquo; With one firm pull, Peter used his Spider-Strength and ripped (Y/N) off the doctor. Peter&rsquo;s strength sent both of them several feet away - their bodies painfully slamming against the ground. Peter took a moment and collected himself, glancing over at (Y/N). He looked startled and disoriented - scared even, his LED now shifting between red and yellow. There was clearly something wrong with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;re fucking crazy!&rdquo; Dr. Greggor yelled through coughs and wheezes as he stumbled to his feet, &ldquo;That thing almost killed me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>lucky</i> Peter was here!&rdquo; (Y/N) shot up from the ground, his LED red once more - but Peter kept a firm grip on his arm, preventing him from attacking again.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> not a thing!&rdquo; Peter shouted as the doctor grasped at his now bruising throat, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a person. They&rsquo;re all people!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s</i> a machine,&rdquo; the doctor hissed, &ldquo;a dangerous, deviant, piece of junk!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Peter couldn&rsquo;t handle it anymore. He let go of (Y/N) and stormed up to the man, &ldquo;If you know what&rsquo;s good for you, you&rsquo;ll take you&rsquo;re Red Ice, bad attitude, and get the hell out of here!&rdquo; Noone said anything. It was just vicious glares and silence all around. Eventually, Dr. Greggor cleared his throat once again and spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s gonna hear about this.&rdquo; He seethed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, he is.&rdquo; Peter snapped back, his hands clenched tightly into fists just waiting to make contact with Greggor&rsquo;s face.</p><p>With a final cough and a lingering glare, Dr. Greggor stumbled out of the hangar. Seconds turned to minutes as Peter stood quietly, not knowing how to feel - what to say. His mind cycled through feelings of confusion, anger, and worry at such a rapid speed that he began to feel sick. With so many emotions all coming through at one time it almost felt like he was going to burn out.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, (Y/N)&hellip;&rdquo; Peter called out softly, &ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>The hangar was still. (Y/N) didn&rsquo;t reply. Peter slowly turned to look at his friend, almost too nervous to see his current state. What was he supposed to say after that? But Peter didn&rsquo;t have to worry about that for long, because (Y/N) wasn&rsquo;t there. He quickly scanned the room but (Y/N) was nowhere in sight. Peter felt his heart sink into his stomach once he set his eyes on the now wide open exit door - that lead directly to the main parking lot.<br/></p><hr><p><b>NEXT \u25b6 in progress<br/>PREVIOUS</b> <b>\u25b6 <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/177961141766/prototype-part-5-reader-x-peter-parker\">PART 5</a></b></p><p><b>PERSONAL ARTWORK INSPIRED BY <i>\u201cPROTOTYPE\u201d</i><br/></b><a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176184798996/so-i-hit-a-minor-writers-block-tonight-for-my-mcu\">ST400 Artwork 01</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176202876016/some-variations-to-aron-originally-seen-here\">ST400 Artwork 02</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176236022471/guys-guys-i-cant-stop-sos-smiling-aron-fucks\">ST400 Artwork 03</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176680976251/i-wanted-to-take-a-break-from-writing-to-let-the\">Rebekah Artwork</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/177538799471/the-new-chapter-should-be-here-in-a-day-or-so-but\">ST400 Digital Painting</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176782768926/wanted-to-do-some-experimental-shit-style-wise\">ST400 x Peter Parker,</a> <br/><b><br/>FANART &amp; COMMISSIONS INSPIRED BY <i>\u201cPROTOTYPE\u201d</i></b><br/><a href=\"http://erikakkomi.tumblr.com/post/176385993670/full-body-commission-of-peter-parker-and\">ST400 x Peter Parker Commission <i>(erikakkomi)</i></a>, <a href=\"http://relssah.tumblr.com/post/176833887698/commission-for-hallodraws-detroitbh-oc-aron\">ST400 Animated Portrait Commission <i>(relssah)</i></a>, <a href=\"http://6y9brows.tumblr.com/post/176845544700/commission-of-judgementjake-s-dbh-oc\">ST400 Commission <i>(6y9brows)</i></a>,</p><p><b></b><b>Tags: </b><a>@tonystanktheirondad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meVu5na_QSyJN-0eIwB7New\">@peter-null</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9ekb9TlA_wm6ILmtxxKBQ\">@starryfool</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW8n0SjFZQaft--WqkgjOpg\">@ragingballofanxiety</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqBbCbTi-GpN3eto7uOFVnQ\">@leo-nerd-oh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQvgd8aTZZsHPYtHjtBLJw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQvgd8aTZZsHPYtHjtBLJw\">@vollycon</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_R4pvxqsLP5y78sSK9sGFw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_R4pvxqsLP5y78sSK9sGFw\">@sharkie-boyyo</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZPXOsR3Y3QR-ZxM5ODy4xA\">@brokenembers</a> @<a href=\"https://dr3amw4lker.tumblr.com/\" title=\"dr3amw4lker\">dr3amw4lker</a> <a>@acelin-ginsberg</a> <a>@kalwinxhester</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXyu3fHIYDMQLroMT5BVVPA\"></a><a>@marvelgoateecollection</a> @just-gay-writing <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5Wnc9eAIuwS4DZPPlI7DwA\">@pineappleneko</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1n5NTXtBjXlesKHlKyH1g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1n5NTXtBjXlesKHlKyH1g\">@maximum-fander</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz40xmNkFx2ZR7Dr-N_80yg\">@green-draws0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2g2hsf7QOX7KS-KTU0vS7Q\">@archerrious</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMlU87EGolYmYYcELGeDFog\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMlU87EGolYmYYcELGeDFog\">@deathbyhallucination</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndH6CfubcoWEHwvwyuqtTg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndH6CfubcoWEHwvwyuqtTg\">@lemon-ghost-flower</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yyXJzWNkrXy1XqNR5fL5g\">@gray-coal</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mut382uTTgjv0iTf-Qzn-lQ\">@quiessilva-meriff</a> @jesusonaboat <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIc-JonhOl94pUhK_mXtjUA\">@miramet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt9geJLJmQgt0hZuryGRtmw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt9geJLJmQgt0hZuryGRtmw\">@theplacewhererobindied</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBJp15hcWG2OSpy10yjh_jQ\">@velveteen-mars</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcXHe7GBBGZJJbNIGyHEkXQ\">@cutieukeboy</a></p>",

As they navigated through the maze the was the New Avengers Facility, Peter glanced around, seeing the various Androids at work. After weeks of doing his routes, he could recognize and name just about all of them. There was <i>Ruby</i>, a custodian Android, peacefully mopping the floor. And then there was <i>Justin</i> and <i>Lauretta</i>, a couple of lab technician Androids, strolling down the hall in the opposite direction. All three of them took time to say hello to Peter - completely ignoring his suit.</p><p>\tAgain the idea of deviancy fluttered into Peter\u2019s head. It was like a headache that just wouldn\u2019t pass. While he waved back to the Androids, his mask was hiding a quiet frown. What was it about deviancy that was so bad? He knew that some deviants had hurt people before, but people also hurt people. And what causes the phenomenon? Could Ruby end up becoming a deviant? Could Justin or Lauretta? What about Rebekah? What about\u2026<i>(Y/N)</i>? That last thought lingered in Peter\u2019s head like an echo in a cave, trailing back deep into his mind where it couldn\u2019t be forgotten.</p><p>\t\u201cPeter?\u201d (Y/N) spoke up, snapping Peter out of his thoughts.</p><p>\t\u201cY-Yeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou seem a little quiet. Is there anything you\u2019d like to talk about?\u201d (Y/N) sounded concerned - but again this upset Peter. Could (Y/N) even <i>be</i> concerned. These thoughts just made Peter more and more confused - and frankly a little sad. He did his best to ignore them.</p><p>\t\u201cI-I\u2019m just a little nervous about potentially running into that jerk Greggor.\u201d He lied.</p><p>\t\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d (Y/N) took the package from Peter\u2019s hands, \u201cIf we see him before we see Rebekah, <i>I\u2019ll</i> handle any interactions, so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t hafta do that.\u201d The memory of Dr. Greggor shoving (Y/N) to the floor flashed through his mind. He didn\u2019t want that to happen again - or god forbid, something worse. But (Y/N) just smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll be alright, Peter,\u201d he did his best to assuage any of Peter\u2019s fears, \u201cBut it means a lot you care about my wellbeing. Thank you.\u201d Peter\u2019s cheeks flushed under his mask once again. His frown curled just enough to form into a smile. He came to the conclusion that the muddy details didn\u2019t matter. Human or not, (Y/N) was his friend, and he cared about him. That was enough.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"256\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4749707f373cf3f3454d36742a5a08c/tumblr_inline_php3xll9LI1twut1a_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"256\"></figure><p>Eventually, the two arrived at the entrance to Hangar 08. Through the glass windows, Peter could see Rebekah just now strolling up to Dr. Greggor. The hangar was empty and dark. It hadn\u2019t looked like this particular area had been used by anyone in a while. Peter squinted through his lenses - now with their night vision activated - to confirm that it <i>was</i>, in fact, Dr. Greggor in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cPeter? They\u2019re right there. Shouldn\u2019t we deliver the package?\u201d (Y/N) asked innocently, but Peter nudged him to the side, just out of view.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s funny, Greggor - a medical doctor - is hanging out in an abandoned hangar?\u201d Peter whispered to (Y/N), whose LED now flickered yellow as he thought about the suspicious scenario.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but\u2013\u201d (Y/N) began.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just wait a second. I want to see what this is all about. It might be nothing.\u201d Peter interrupted, now leaning close against the glass. As he tapped into his super-hearing, he could make out both Rebekah\u2019s and Greggor\u2019s voices out perfectly.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dr. Greggor.\u201d Rebekah addressed him with a professional and happy tone.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring it?\u201d The doctor sounded irritated, not at all welcoming to Rebekah.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d She began going through the packages in her arms, \u201cI followed the same instructions you gave to the other delivery Androids. All packages addressed to you are to be delivered to you <i>here</i> at Hangar 08.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow <i>that</i> sounds suspicious, right?\u201d Peter asked under his breath. He glanced back at (Y/N) who gave a simple nod, his LED flickering yellow as he too was confused about what was going on.</p><p>\u201cOne moment, sir.\u201d Rebekah went through the packages again, \u201cI can\u2019t seem to find it. I know it was here. I marked it down once it came into the\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just let me do it!\u201d Dr. Greggor violently swiped the packages from her hands, casting them aside once he saw the names listed were not his own. He began to pant as he flipped through the last remaining envelopes.</p><p>\u201cDr. Greggor, are you alright?\u201d Rebekah stepped forward as she examined the man, \u201cYou seem agitated. You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re in good health.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Agitated</i>?,\u201d He grunted, his hands tightly squeezing into fists, \u201cYou <i>lost</i> my <i>shit</i>, of course I\u2019m agitated!\u201d He began to shout. Peter realized he no longer needed to use his powers to hear the man. He was angry - <i>furious</i> even, but why?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 have dust on your collar, sir.\u201d Rebekah reached out to touch the doctor\u2019s shirt, but he quickly recoiled with disgust.</p><p>\u201c<i>Don\u2019t</i> fucking touch me!\u201d Greggor barked.</p><p>\u201cDust?\u201d Peter muttered softly to himself - slowly putting the pieces together in his head.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what is it?\u201d (Y/N) asked. Peter didn\u2019t reply, but instead took the envelope from (Y/N)\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cI just need to see something,\u201d Peter tore open the sealed envelope and reached inside, pulling out the contents - a collection of small individually wrapped bags of a red crystalline substance, \u201cThis is\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed Ice.\u201d (Y/N) finished his sentence. Peter\u2019s face was that of pure horror. All the color drained from his cheeks once he finally grasped what it was he was holding. Illegal drugs - Red Ice of all things. Red Ice was currently a big deal in Detroit, but he didn\u2019t realize it had begun reaching other cities. The two remained quiet, looking back to Dr. Greggor and Rebekah.</p><p>\u201cMy scans\u2026\u201d Rebekah\u2019s LED flickered yellow as she scanned the dust. She was silent for just a moment until suddenly her eyes became very concerned, \u201c\u2026detect traces of Acetone, Lithium, Thirium, Toluene, and Hydrochloric Acid\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Bitch!\u201d his head snapped in her direction, sweat starting to drip down his face, \u201cWhere did you put my shit?!\u201d With a firm hand, the doctor slapped Rebekah across the face, sending her to the floor.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"234\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0c8dff3458a375a5f62286626e8d109/tumblr_inline_php3y8HlmJ1twut1a_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"234\"></figure><p>That was their cue. Without another second passing, Peter swung into the hangar at full speed, (Y/N) close behind. (Y/N) hurried to Rebekah\u2019s side, her LED now rapidly blinking red as she scrambled into his arms. Peter wasted no time storming up to the doctor. Up close he looked awful - sick even. His eyes were bloodshot, his complexion was pale, he was beginning to sweat profusely, and he just looked so unbelievably angry.</p><p>\u201cYou hit a girl! What\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d Peter waved his finger in Greggor\u2019s face - like a parent chastising a child.</p><p>\u201c<i>That</i> isn\u2019t a girl!\u201d The doctor swatted Peter\u2019s hand away and pointed at Rebekah on the floor - still clinging to (Y/N), \u201cIt\u2019s just a heaping sack of bolts, metal, and Thirium!\u201d He started to lunge at the two Androids on the ground - both fists clenched tightly.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Peter stepped in front of him, holding him away from the two. Peter didn\u2019t want to use his powers - he didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone, but Dr. Greggor was clearly dangerous.</p><p>Rebekah and (Y/N) slowly got to their feet while Peter did his best to keep their attacker at bay. It didn\u2019t take long for things to get out of hand. Dr. Greggor swung his leg - kneeing Peter painfully in his stomach. Peter went down, hard. Seeing this sent Rebekah into a frenzy. With her LED now a bright and solid red, she quickly ran from (Y/N)\u2019s side, fleeing the room in tears. The doctor kicked Peter while he was down - literally, in the same spot. Behind the mask, Peter let out a painful gasp as Greggor\u2019s boot made contact. (Y/N) stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cStay out of this, Tin Man!\u201d Greggor screamed. (Y/N) obeyed - clearly distressed about what was going on. His LED blinked from yellow to red as his eyes fell to his friend in a heap on the ground.</p><p>\u201cAlways the sidekick, never the hero,\u201d Dr. Greggor turned to the young man, bending down to stare daggers directly into his eyes, \u201cI know where I stand amongst the Avengers. <i>You</i>? With or without powers, you\u2019re just a dumb kid. They don\u2019t need you.\u201d Peter finally got himself up, his lenses tight as he glared at the man above him. As Dr. Greggor raised his fist for another blow on Peter, Peter did the same - prepared to put an end to this altercation at whatever cost.</p><p>But suddenly, it was (Y/N) who had his hands around Dr. Greggor\u2019s collar. Before anyone could react, the sound of the doctor\u2019s body hitting the ground echoed throughout the hangar. (Y/N) stood over him, now with both hands around the doctor\u2019s neck as his LED beamed red. He remained silent through it all, but his eyes said enough. He looked beyond infuriated - and it actually began to scare Peter.</p><p>\u201cH-Hey! Get\u2026off\u2026me!\u201d Dr. Greggor flailed about as he struggled to breathe.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) Stop! That\u2019s enough!\u201d Peter stood and ran to the two men on the ground,\u00a0placing his hands firmly on (Y/N)\u2019s shoulders, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill him!\u201d It was no use. (Y/N) continued to squeeze - ignoring Peter\u2019s pleas. Soon Dr. Greggor began to turn blue in the face and his voice began to fade into quiet gurgles.</p><p>\u201cI said that\u2019s <i>enough</i>!\u201d With one firm pull, Peter used his Spider-Strength and ripped (Y/N) off the doctor. Peter\u2019s strength sent both of them several feet away - their bodies painfully slamming against the ground. Peter took a moment and collected himself, glancing over at (Y/N). He looked startled and disoriented - scared even, his LED now shifting between red and yellow. There was clearly something wrong with him.</p><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re fucking crazy!\u201d Dr. Greggor yelled through coughs and wheezes as he stumbled to his feet, \u201cThat thing almost killed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re <i>lucky</i> Peter was here!\u201d (Y/N) shot up from the ground, his LED red once more - but Peter kept a firm grip on his arm, preventing him from attacking again.</p><p>\u201c<i>He\u2019s</i> not a thing!\u201d Peter shouted as the doctor grasped at his now bruising throat, \u201cHe\u2019s a person. They\u2019re all people!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s</i> a machine,\u201d the doctor hissed, \u201ca dangerous, deviant, piece of junk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. He let go of (Y/N) and stormed up to the man, \u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll take you\u2019re Red Ice, bad attitude, and get the hell out of here!\u201d Noone said anything. It was just vicious glares and silence all around. Eventually, Dr. Greggor cleared his throat once again and spoke.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s gonna hear about this.\u201d He seethed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is.\u201d Peter snapped back, his hands clenched tightly into fists just waiting to make contact with Greggor\u2019s face.</p><p>With a final cough and a lingering glare, Dr. Greggor stumbled out of the hangar. Seconds turned to minutes as Peter stood quietly, not knowing how to feel - what to say. His mind cycled through feelings of confusion, anger, and worry at such a rapid speed that he began to feel sick. With so many emotions all coming through at one time it almost felt like he was going to burn out.</p><p>\u201cShit, (Y/N)\u2026\u201d Peter called out softly, \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The hangar was still. (Y/N) didn\u2019t reply. Peter slowly turned to look at his friend, almost too nervous to see his current state. What was he supposed to say after that? But Peter didn\u2019t have to worry about that for long, because (Y/N) wasn\u2019t there. He quickly scanned the room but (Y/N) was nowhere in sight. Peter felt his heart sink into his stomach once he set his eyes on the now wide open exit door - that lead directly to the main parking lot.<br></p><hr><p><b>NEXT \u25b6 in progress<br>PREVIOUS</b> <b>\u25b6 <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/177961141766/prototype-part-5-reader-x-peter-parker\">PART 5</a></b></p><p><b>PERSONAL ARTWORK INSPIRED BY <i>\u201cPROTOTYPE\u201d</i><br></b><a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176184798996/so-i-hit-a-minor-writers-block-tonight-for-my-mcu\">ST400 Artwork 01</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176202876016/some-variations-to-aron-originally-seen-here\">ST400 Artwork 02</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176236022471/guys-guys-i-cant-stop-sos-smiling-aron-fucks\">ST400 Artwork 03</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176680976251/i-wanted-to-take-a-break-from-writing-to-let-the\">Rebekah Artwork</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/177538799471/the-new-chapter-should-be-here-in-a-day-or-so-but\">ST400 Digital Painting</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176782768926/wanted-to-do-some-experimental-shit-style-wise\">ST400 x Peter Parker,</a> <br><b><br>FANART &amp; COMMISSIONS INSPIRED BY <i>\u201cPROTOTYPE\u201d</i></b><br><a href=\"http://erikakkomi.tumblr.com/post/176385993670/full-body-commission-of-peter-parker-and\">ST400 x Peter Parker Commission <i>(erikakkomi)</i></a>, <a href=\"http://relssah.tumblr.com/post/176833887698/commission-for-hallodraws-detroitbh-oc-aron\">ST400 Animated Portrait Commission <i>(relssah)</i></a>, <a href=\"http://6y9brows.tumblr.com/post/176845544700/commission-of-judgementjake-s-dbh-oc\">ST400 Commission <i>(6y9brows)</i></a>,</p><p><b></b><b>Tags: </b><a>@tonystanktheirondad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meVu5na_QSyJN-0eIwB7New\">@peter-null</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9ekb9TlA_wm6ILmtxxKBQ\">@starryfool</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW8n0SjFZQaft--WqkgjOpg\">@ragingballofanxiety</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqBbCbTi-GpN3eto7uOFVnQ\">@leo-nerd-oh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQvgd8aTZZsHPYtHjtBLJw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQvgd8aTZZsHPYtHjtBLJw\">@vollycon</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_R4pvxqsLP5y78sSK9sGFw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_R4pvxqsLP5y78sSK9sGFw\">@sharkie-boyyo</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZPXOsR3Y3QR-ZxM5ODy4xA\">@brokenembers</a> @<a href=\"https://dr3amw4lker.tumblr.com/\" title=\"dr3amw4lker\">dr3amw4lker</a> <a>@acelin-ginsberg</a> <a>@kalwinxhester</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXyu3fHIYDMQLroMT5BVVPA\"></a><a>@marvelgoateecollection</a> @just-gay-writing <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5Wnc9eAIuwS4DZPPlI7DwA\">@pineappleneko</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1n5NTXtBjXlesKHlKyH1g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1n5NTXtBjXlesKHlKyH1g\">@maximum-fander</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz40xmNkFx2ZR7Dr-N_80yg\">@green-draws0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2g2hsf7QOX7KS-KTU0vS7Q\">@archerrious</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMlU87EGolYmYYcELGeDFog\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMlU87EGolYmYYcELGeDFog\">@deathbyhallucination</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndH6CfubcoWEHwvwyuqtTg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndH6CfubcoWEHwvwyuqtTg\">@lemon-ghost-flower</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yyXJzWNkrXy1XqNR5fL5g\">@gray-coal</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mut382uTTgjv0iTf-Qzn-lQ\">@quiessilva-meriff</a> @jesusonaboat <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIc-JonhOl94pUhK_mXtjUA\">@miramet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt9geJLJmQgt0hZuryGRtmw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt9geJLJmQgt0hZuryGRtmw\">@theplacewhererobindied</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBJp15hcWG2OSpy10yjh_jQ\">@velveteen-mars</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcXHe7GBBGZJJbNIGyHEkXQ\">@cutieukeboy</a></p>",

As they navigated through the maze the was the New Avengers Facility, Peter glanced around, seeing the various Androids at work. After weeks of doing his routes, he could recognize and name just about all of them. There was <i>Ruby</i>, a custodian Android, peacefully mopping the floor. And then there was <i>Justin</i> and <i>Lauretta</i>, a couple of lab technician Androids, strolling down the hall in the opposite direction. All three of them took time to say hello to Peter - completely ignoring his suit.</p><p>\tAgain the idea of deviancy fluttered into Peter\u2019s head. It was like a headache that just wouldn\u2019t pass. While he waved back to the Androids, his mask was hiding a quiet frown. What was it about deviancy that was so bad? He knew that some deviants had hurt people before, but people also hurt people. And what causes the phenomenon? Could Ruby end up becoming a deviant? Could Justin or Lauretta? What about Rebekah?

Is there anything you\u2019d like to talk about?\u201d (Y/N) sounded concerned - but again this upset Peter. Could (Y/N) even <i>be</i> concerned. These thoughts just made Peter more and more confused - and frankly a little sad. He did his best to ignore them.</p><p>\t\u201cI-I\u2019m just a little nervous about potentially running into that jerk Greggor.\u201d He lied.</p><p>\t\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d (Y/N) took the package from Peter\u2019s hands, \u201cIf we see him before we see Rebekah, <i>I\u2019ll</i> handle any interactions, so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t hafta do that.\u201d The memory of Dr. Greggor shoving (Y/N) to the floor flashed through his mind.

Human or not, (Y/N) was his friend, and he cared about him. That was enough.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"256\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4749707f373cf3f3454d36742a5a08c/tumblr_inline_php3xll9LI1twut1a_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"256\"></figure><p>Eventually, the two arrived at the entrance to Hangar 08. Through the glass windows, Peter could see Rebekah just now strolling up to Dr. Greggor. The hangar was empty and dark. It hadn\u2019t looked like this particular area had been used by anyone in a while. Peter squinted through his lenses - now with their night vision activated - to confirm that it <i>was</i>, in fact, Dr. Greggor in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cPeter? They\u2019re right there. Shouldn\u2019t we deliver the package?\u201d (Y/N) asked innocently, but Peter nudged him to the side, just out of view.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s funny, Greggor - a medical doctor - is hanging out in an abandoned hangar?\u201d Peter whispered to (Y/N), whose LED now flickered yellow as he thought about the suspicious scenario.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but\u2013\u201d (Y/N) began.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just wait a second. I want to see what this is all about. It might be nothing.\u201d Peter interrupted, now leaning close against the glass. As he tapped into his super-hearing, he could make out both Rebekah\u2019s and Greggor\u2019s voices out perfectly.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dr. Greggor.\u201d Rebekah addressed him with a professional and happy tone.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring it?\u201d The doctor sounded irritated, not at all welcoming to Rebekah.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d She began going through the packages in her arms, \u201cI followed the same instructions you gave to the other delivery Androids. All packages addressed to you are to be delivered to you <i>here</i> at Hangar 08.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow <i>that</i> sounds suspicious, right?\u201d Peter asked under his breath. He glanced back at (Y/N) who gave a simple nod, his LED flickering yellow as he too was confused about what was going on.</p><p>\u201cOne moment, sir.\u201d Rebekah went through the packages again, \u201cI can\u2019t seem to find it. I know it was here. I marked it down once it came into the\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just let me do it!\u201d Dr. Greggor violently swiped the packages from her hands, casting them aside once he saw the names listed were not his own. He began to pant as he flipped through the last remaining envelopes.</p><p>\u201cDr. Greggor, are you alright?\u201d Rebekah stepped forward as she examined the man, \u201cYou seem agitated. You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re in good health.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Agitated</i>?,\u201d He grunted, his hands tightly squeezing into fists, \u201cYou <i>lost</i> my <i>shit</i>, of course I\u2019m agitated!\u201d He began to shout. Peter realized he no longer needed to use his powers to hear the man. He was angry - <i>furious</i> even, but why?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 have dust on your collar, sir.\u201d Rebekah reached out to touch the doctor\u2019s shirt, but he quickly recoiled with disgust.</p><p>\u201c<i>Don\u2019t</i> fucking touch me!\u201d Greggor barked.</p><p>\u201cDust?\u201d Peter muttered softly to himself - slowly putting the pieces together in his head.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what is it?\u201d (Y/N) asked. Peter didn\u2019t reply, but instead took the envelope from (Y/N)\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cI just need to see something,\u201d Peter tore open the sealed envelope and reached inside, pulling out the contents - a collection of small individually wrapped bags of a red crystalline substance, \u201cThis is\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed Ice.\u201d (Y/N) finished his sentence. Peter\u2019s face was that of pure horror. All the color drained from his cheeks once he finally grasped what it was he was holding. Illegal drugs - Red Ice of all things. Red Ice was currently a big deal in Detroit, but he didn\u2019t realize it had begun reaching other cities. The two remained quiet, looking back to Dr. Greggor and Rebekah.</p><p>\u201cMy scans\u2026\u201d Rebekah\u2019s LED flickered yellow as she scanned the dust. She was silent for just a moment until suddenly her eyes became very concerned, \u201c\u2026detect traces of Acetone, Lithium, Thirium, Toluene, and Hydrochloric Acid\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Bitch!\u201d his head snapped in her direction, sweat starting to drip down his face, \u201cWhere did you put my shit?!\u201d With a firm hand, the doctor slapped Rebekah across the face, sending her to the floor.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"234\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0c8dff3458a375a5f62286626e8d109/tumblr_inline_php3y8HlmJ1twut1a_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"234\"></figure><p>That was their cue. Without another second passing, Peter swung into the hangar at full speed, (Y/N) close behind. (Y/N) hurried to Rebekah\u2019s side, her LED now rapidly blinking red as she scrambled into his arms. Peter wasted no time storming up to the doctor. Up close he looked awful - sick even. His eyes were bloodshot, his complexion was pale, he was beginning to sweat profusely, and he just looked so unbelievably angry.</p><p>\u201cYou hit a girl! What\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d Peter waved his finger in Greggor\u2019s face - like a parent chastising a child.</p><p>\u201c<i>That</i> isn\u2019t a girl!\u201d The doctor swatted Peter\u2019s hand away and pointed at Rebekah on the floor - still clinging to (Y/N), \u201cIt\u2019s just a heaping sack of bolts, metal, and Thirium!\u201d He started to lunge at the two Androids on the ground - both fists clenched tightly.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Peter stepped in front of him, holding him away from the two. Peter didn\u2019t want to use his powers - he didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone, but Dr. Greggor was clearly dangerous.</p><p>Rebekah and (Y/N) slowly got to their feet while Peter did his best to keep their attacker at bay. It didn\u2019t take long for things to get out of hand. Dr. Greggor swung his leg - kneeing Peter painfully in his stomach. Peter went down, hard. Seeing this sent Rebekah into a frenzy. With her LED now a bright and solid red, she quickly ran from (Y/N)\u2019s side, fleeing the room in tears. The doctor kicked Peter while he was down - literally, in the same spot. Behind the mask, Peter let out a painful gasp as Greggor\u2019s boot made contact. (Y/N) stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cStay out of this, Tin Man!\u201d Greggor screamed. (Y/N) obeyed - clearly distressed about what was going on. His LED blinked from yellow to red as his eyes fell to his friend in a heap on the ground.</p><p>\u201cAlways the sidekick, never the hero,\u201d Dr. Greggor turned to the young man, bending down to stare daggers directly into his eyes, \u201cI know where I stand amongst the Avengers. <i>You</i>? With or without powers, you\u2019re just a dumb kid. They don\u2019t need you.\u201d Peter finally got himself up, his lenses tight as he glared at the man above him. As Dr. Greggor raised his fist for another blow on Peter, Peter did the same - prepared to put an end to this altercation at whatever cost.</p><p>But suddenly, it was (Y/N) who had his hands around Dr. Greggor\u2019s collar. Before anyone could react, the sound of the doctor\u2019s body hitting the ground echoed throughout the hangar. (Y/N) stood over him, now with both hands around the doctor\u2019s neck as his LED beamed red. He remained silent through it all, but his eyes said enough. He looked beyond infuriated - and it actually began to scare Peter.</p><p>\u201cH-Hey! Get\u2026off\u2026me!\u201d Dr. Greggor flailed about as he struggled to breathe.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) Stop! That\u2019s enough!\u201d Peter stood and ran to the two men on the ground,\u00a0placing his hands firmly on (Y/N)\u2019s shoulders, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill him!\u201d It was no use. (Y/N) continued to squeeze - ignoring Peter\u2019s pleas. Soon Dr. Greggor began to turn blue in the face and his voice began to fade into quiet gurgles.</p><p>\u201cI said that\u2019s <i>enough</i>!\u201d With one firm pull, Peter used his Spider-Strength and ripped (Y/N) off the doctor. Peter\u2019s strength sent both of them several feet away - their bodies painfully slamming against the ground. Peter took a moment and collected himself, glancing over at (Y/N). He looked startled and disoriented - scared even, his LED now shifting between red and yellow. There was clearly something wrong with him.</p><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re fucking crazy!\u201d Dr. Greggor yelled through coughs and wheezes as he stumbled to his feet, \u201cThat thing almost killed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re <i>lucky</i> Peter was here!\u201d (Y/N) shot up from the ground, his LED red once more - but Peter kept a firm grip on his arm, preventing him from attacking again.</p><p>\u201c<i>He\u2019s</i> not a thing!\u201d Peter shouted as the doctor grasped at his now bruising throat, \u201cHe\u2019s a person. They\u2019re all people!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s</i> a machine,\u201d the doctor hissed, \u201ca dangerous, deviant, piece of junk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. He let go of (Y/N) and stormed up to the man, \u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll take you\u2019re Red Ice, bad attitude, and get the hell out of here!\u201d Noone said anything. It was just vicious glares and silence all around. Eventually, Dr. Greggor cleared his throat once again and spoke.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s gonna hear about this.\u201d He seethed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is.\u201d Peter snapped back, his hands clenched tightly into fists just waiting to make contact with Greggor\u2019s face.</p><p>With a final cough and a lingering glare, Dr. Greggor stumbled out of the hangar. Seconds turned to minutes as Peter stood quietly, not knowing how to feel - what to say. His mind cycled through feelings of confusion, anger, and worry at such a rapid speed that he began to feel sick. With so many emotions all coming through at one time it almost felt like he was going to burn out.</p><p>\u201cShit, (Y/N)\u2026\u201d Peter called out softly, \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The hangar was still. (Y/N) didn\u2019t reply. Peter slowly turned to look at his friend, almost too nervous to see his current state. What was he supposed to say after that? But Peter didn\u2019t have to worry about that for long, because (Y/N) wasn\u2019t there. He quickly scanned the room but (Y/N) was nowhere in sight. Peter felt his heart sink into his stomach once he set his eyes on the now wide open exit door - that lead directly to the main parking lot.<br></p><hr><p><b>NEXT \u25b6 in progress<br>PREVIOUS</b> <b>\u25b6 <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/177961141766/prototype-part-5-reader-x-peter-parker\">PART 5</a></b></p><p><b>PERSONAL ARTWORK INSPIRED BY <i>\u201cPROTOTYPE\u201d</i><br></b><a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176184798996/so-i-hit-a-minor-writers-block-tonight-for-my-mcu\">ST400 Artwork 01</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176202876016/some-variations-to-aron-originally-seen-here\">ST400 Artwork 02</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176236022471/guys-guys-i-cant-stop-sos-smiling-aron-fucks\">ST400 Artwork 03</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176680976251/i-wanted-to-take-a-break-from-writing-to-let-the\">Rebekah Artwork</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/177538799471/the-new-chapter-should-be-here-in-a-day-or-so-but\">ST400 Digital Painting</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176782768926/wanted-to-do-some-experimental-shit-style-wise\">ST400 x Peter Parker,</a> <br><b><br>FANART &amp; COMMISSIONS INSPIRED BY <i>\u201cPROTOTYPE\u201d</i></b><br><a href=\"http://erikakkomi.tumblr.com/post/176385993670/full-body-commission-of-peter-parker-and\">ST400 x Peter Parker Commission <i>(erikakkomi)</i></a>, <a href=\"http://relssah.tumblr.com/post/176833887698/commission-for-hallodraws-detroitbh-oc-aron\">ST400 Animated Portrait Commission <i>(relssah)</i></a>, <a href=\"http://6y9brows.tumblr.com/post/176845544700/commission-of-judgementjake-s-dbh-oc\">ST400 Commission <i>(6y9brows)</i></a>,</p><p><b></b><b>Tags: </b><a>@tonystanktheirondad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meVu5na_QSyJN-0eIwB7New\">@peter-null</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9ekb9TlA_wm6ILmtxxKBQ\">@starryfool</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW8n0SjFZQaft--WqkgjOpg\">@ragingballofanxiety</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqBbCbTi-GpN3eto7uOFVnQ\">@leo-nerd-oh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQvgd8aTZZsHPYtHjtBLJw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQvgd8aTZZsHPYtHjtBLJw\">@vollycon</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_R4pvxqsLP5y78sSK9sGFw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_R4pvxqsLP5y78sSK9sGFw\">@sharkie-boyyo</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZPXOsR3Y3QR-ZxM5ODy4xA\">@brokenembers</a> @<a href=\"https://dr3amw4lker.tumblr.com/\" title=\"dr3amw4lker\">dr3amw4lker</a> <a>@acelin-ginsberg</a> <a>@kalwinxhester</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXyu3fHIYDMQLroMT5BVVPA\"></a><a>@marvelgoateecollection</a> @just-gay-writing <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5Wnc9eAIuwS4DZPPlI7DwA\">@pineappleneko</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1n5NTXtBjXlesKHlKyH1g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1n5NTXtBjXlesKHlKyH1g\">@maximum-fander</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz40xmNkFx2ZR7Dr-N_80yg\">@green-draws0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2g2hsf7QOX7KS-KTU0vS7Q\">@archerrious</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMlU87EGolYmYYcELGeDFog\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMlU87EGolYmYYcELGeDFog\">@deathbyhallucination</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndH6CfubcoWEHwvwyuqtTg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndH6CfubcoWEHwvwyuqtTg\">@lemon-ghost-flower</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yyXJzWNkrXy1XqNR5fL5g\">@gray-coal</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mut382uTTgjv0iTf-Qzn-lQ\">@quiessilva-meriff</a> @jesusonaboat <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIc-JonhOl94pUhK_mXtjUA\">@miramet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt9geJLJmQgt0hZuryGRtmw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt9geJLJmQgt0hZuryGRtmw\">@theplacewhererobindied</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBJp15hcWG2OSpy10yjh_jQ\">@velveteen-mars</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcXHe7GBBGZJJbNIGyHEkXQ\">@cutieukeboy</a></p>",

He glanced back at (Y/N) who gave a simple nod, his LED flickering yellow as he too was confused about what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;One moment, sir.&rdquo; Rebekah went through the packages again, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to find it. I know it was here. I marked it down once it came into the&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, just let me do it!&rdquo; Dr. Greggor violently swiped the packages from her hands, casting them aside once he saw the names listed were not his own. He began to pant as he flipped through the last remaining envelopes.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Greggor, are you alright?&rdquo; Rebekah stepped forward as she examined the man, &ldquo;You seem agitated. You don&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;re in good health.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Agitated</i>?,&rdquo; He grunted, his hands tightly squeezing into fists, &ldquo;You <i>lost</i> my <i>shit</i>, of course I&rsquo;m agitated!&rdquo; He began to shout. Peter realized he no longer needed to use his powers to hear the man. He was angry - <i>furious</i> even, but why?</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip; have dust on your collar, sir.&rdquo; Rebekah reached out to touch the doctor&rsquo;s shirt, but he quickly recoiled with disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> fucking touch me!&rdquo; Greggor barked.</p><p>&ldquo;Dust?&rdquo; Peter muttered softly to himself - slowly putting the pieces together in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what is it?&rdquo; (Y/N) asked. Peter didn&rsquo;t reply, but instead took the envelope from (Y/N)&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I just need to see something,&rdquo; Peter tore open the sealed envelope and reached inside, pulling out the contents - a collection of small individually wrapped bags of a red crystalline substance, &ldquo;This is&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Red Ice.&rdquo; (Y/N) finished his sentence. Peter&rsquo;s face was that of pure horror. All the color drained from his cheeks once he finally grasped what it was he was holding. Illegal drugs - Red Ice of all things. Red Ice was currently a big deal in Detroit, but he didn&rsquo;t realize it had begun reaching other cities. The two remained quiet, looking back to Dr. Greggor and Rebekah.</p><p>&ldquo;My scans&hellip;&rdquo; Rebekah&rsquo;s LED flickered yellow as she scanned the dust. She was silent for just a moment until suddenly her eyes became very concerned, &ldquo;&hellip;detect traces of Acetone, Lithium, Thirium, Toluene, and Hydrochloric Acid&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Bitch!&rdquo; his head snapped in her direction, sweat starting to drip down his face, &ldquo;Where did you put my shit?!&rdquo; With a firm hand, the doctor slapped Rebekah across the face, sending her to the floor.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0c8dff3458a375a5f62286626e8d109/tumblr_inline_php3y8HlmJ1twut1a_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>That was their cue. Without another second passing, Peter swung into the hangar at full speed, (Y/N) close behind. (Y/N) hurried to Rebekah&rsquo;s side, her LED now rapidly blinking red as she scrambled into his arms. Peter wasted no time storming up to the doctor. Up close he looked awful - sick even. His eyes were bloodshot, his complexion was pale, he was beginning to sweat profusely, and he just looked so unbelievably angry.</p><p>&ldquo;You hit a girl! What&rsquo;s wrong with you?!&rdquo; Peter waved his finger in Greggor&rsquo;s face - like a parent chastising a child.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> isn&rsquo;t a girl!&rdquo; The doctor swatted Peter&rsquo;s hand away and pointed at Rebekah on the floor - still clinging to (Y/N), &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a heaping sack of bolts, metal, and Thirium!&rdquo; He started to lunge at the two Androids on the ground - both fists clenched tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave her alone!&rdquo; Peter stepped in front of him, holding him away from the two. Peter didn&rsquo;t want to use his powers - he didn&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone, but Dr. Greggor was clearly dangerous.</p><p>Rebekah and (Y/N) slowly got to their feet while Peter did his best to keep their attacker at bay. It didn&rsquo;t take long for things to get out of hand. Dr. Greggor swung his leg - kneeing Peter painfully in his stomach. Peter went down, hard. Seeing this sent Rebekah into a frenzy. With her LED now a bright and solid red, she quickly ran from (Y/N)&rsquo;s side, fleeing the room in tears. The doctor kicked Peter while he was down - literally, in the same spot. Behind the mask, Peter let out a painful gasp as Greggor&rsquo;s boot made contact. (Y/N) stepped forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay out of this, Tin Man!&rdquo; Greggor screamed. (Y/N) obeyed - clearly distressed about what was going on. His LED blinked from yellow to red as his eyes fell to his friend in a heap on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Always the sidekick, never the hero,&rdquo; Dr. Greggor turned to the young man, bending down to stare daggers directly into his eyes, &ldquo;I know where I stand amongst the Avengers. <i>You</i>? With or without powers, you&rsquo;re just a dumb kid. They don&rsquo;t need you.&rdquo; Peter finally got himself up, his lenses tight as he glared at the man above him. As Dr. Greggor raised his fist for another blow on Peter, Peter did the same - prepared to put an end to this altercation at whatever cost.</p><p>But suddenly, it was (Y/N) who had his hands around Dr. Greggor&rsquo;s collar. Before anyone could react, the sound of the doctor&rsquo;s body hitting the ground echoed throughout the hangar. (Y/N) stood over him, now with both hands around the doctor&rsquo;s neck as his LED beamed red. He remained silent through it all, but his eyes said enough. He looked beyond infuriated - and it actually began to scare Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Hey! Get&hellip;off&hellip;me!&rdquo; Dr. Greggor flailed about as he struggled to breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) Stop! That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; Peter stood and ran to the two men on the ground,&nbsp;placing his hands firmly on (Y/N)&rsquo;s shoulders, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna kill him!&rdquo; It was no use. (Y/N) continued to squeeze - ignoring Peter&rsquo;s pleas. Soon Dr. Greggor began to turn blue in the face and his voice began to fade into quiet gurgles.</p><p>&ldquo;I said that&rsquo;s <i>enough</i>!&rdquo; With one firm pull, Peter used his Spider-Strength and ripped (Y/N) off the doctor. Peter&rsquo;s strength sent both of them several feet away - their bodies painfully slamming against the ground. Peter took a moment and collected himself, glancing over at (Y/N). He looked startled and disoriented - scared even, his LED now shifting between red and yellow. There was clearly something wrong with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;re fucking crazy!&rdquo; Dr. Greggor yelled through coughs and wheezes as he stumbled to his feet, &ldquo;That thing almost killed me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>lucky</i> Peter was here!&rdquo; (Y/N) shot up from the ground, his LED red once more - but Peter kept a firm grip on his arm, preventing him from attacking again.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> not a thing!&rdquo; Peter shouted as the doctor grasped at his now bruising throat, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a person. They&rsquo;re all people!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s</i> a machine,&rdquo; the doctor hissed, &ldquo;a dangerous, deviant, piece of junk!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Peter couldn&rsquo;t handle it anymore. He let go of (Y/N) and stormed up to the man, &ldquo;If you know what&rsquo;s good for you, you&rsquo;ll take you&rsquo;re Red Ice, bad attitude, and get the hell out of here!&rdquo; Noone said anything. It was just vicious glares and silence all around. Eventually, Dr. Greggor cleared his throat once again and spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s gonna hear about this.&rdquo; He seethed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, he is.&rdquo; Peter snapped back, his hands clenched tightly into fists just waiting to make contact with Greggor&rsquo;s face.</p><p>With a final cough and a lingering glare, Dr. Greggor stumbled out of the hangar. Seconds turned to minutes as Peter stood quietly, not knowing how to feel - what to say. His mind cycled through feelings of confusion, anger, and worry at such a rapid speed that he began to feel sick. With so many emotions all coming through at one time it almost felt like he was going to burn out.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, (Y/N)&hellip;&rdquo; Peter called out softly, &ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>The hangar was still. (Y/N) didn&rsquo;t reply. Peter slowly turned to look at his friend, almost too nervous to see his current state. What was he supposed to say after that? But Peter didn&rsquo;t have to worry about that for long, because (Y/N) wasn&rsquo;t there. He quickly scanned the room but (Y/N) was nowhere in sight. Peter felt his heart sink into his stomach once he set his eyes on the now wide open exit door - that lead directly to the main parking lot.<br /></p><hr /><p><b>NEXT &#9654; in progress<br />PREVIOUS</b> <b>&#9654; <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/177961141766/prototype-part-5-reader-x-peter-parker\">PART 5</a></b></p><p><b>PERSONAL ARTWORK INSPIRED BY <i>&ldquo;PROTOTYPE&rdquo;</i><br /></b><a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176184798996/so-i-hit-a-minor-writers-block-tonight-for-my-mcu\">ST400 Artwork 01</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176202876016/some-variations-to-aron-originally-seen-here\">ST400 Artwork 02</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176236022471/guys-guys-i-cant-stop-sos-smiling-aron-fucks\">ST400 Artwork 03</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176680976251/i-wanted-to-take-a-break-from-writing-to-let-the\">Rebekah Artwork</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/177538799471/the-new-chapter-should-be-here-in-a-day-or-so-but\">ST400 Digital Painting</a>, <a href=\"https://hallodraws.tumblr.com/post/176782768926/wanted-to-do-some-experimental-shit-style-wise\">ST400 x Peter Parker,</a> <br /><b><br />FANART &amp; COMMISSIONS INSPIRED BY <i>&ldquo;PROTOTYPE&rdquo;</i></b><br /><a href=\"http://erikakkomi.tumblr.com/post/176385993670/full-body-commission-of-peter-parker-and\">ST400 x Peter Parker Commission <i>(erikakkomi)</i></a>, <a href=\"http://relssah.tumblr.com/post/176833887698/commission-for-hallodraws-detroitbh-oc-aron\">ST400 Animated Portrait Commission <i>(relssah)</i></a>, <a href=\"http://6y9brows.tumblr.com/post/176845544700/commission-of-judgementjake-s-dbh-oc\">ST400 Commission <i>(6y9brows)</i></a>,</p><p><b></b><b>Tags: </b><a>@tonystanktheirondad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meVu5na_QSyJN-0eIwB7New\">@peter-null</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9ekb9TlA_wm6ILmtxxKBQ\">@starryfool</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW8n0SjFZQaft--WqkgjOpg\">@ragingballofanxiety</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqBbCbTi-GpN3eto7uOFVnQ\">@leo-nerd-oh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQvgd8aTZZsHPYtHjtBLJw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQvgd8aTZZsHPYtHjtBLJw\">@vollycon</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_R4pvxqsLP5y78sSK9sGFw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_R4pvxqsLP5y78sSK9sGFw\">@sharkie-boyyo</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZPXOsR3Y3QR-ZxM5ODy4xA\">@brokenembers</a> @<a href=\"https://dr3amw4lker.tumblr.com/\" title=\"dr3amw4lker\">dr3amw4lker</a> <a>@acelin-ginsberg</a> <a>@kalwinxhester</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXyu3fHIYDMQLroMT5BVVPA\"></a><a>@marvelgoateecollection</a> @just-gay-writing <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5Wnc9eAIuwS4DZPPlI7DwA\">@pineappleneko</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1n5NTXtBjXlesKHlKyH1g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_1n5NTXtBjXlesKHlKyH1g\">@maximum-fander</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz40xmNkFx2ZR7Dr-N_80yg\">@green-draws0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2g2hsf7QOX7KS-KTU0vS7Q\">@archerrious</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMlU87EGolYmYYcELGeDFog\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMlU87EGolYmYYcELGeDFog\">@deathbyhallucination</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndH6CfubcoWEHwvwyuqtTg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mndH6CfubcoWEHwvwyuqtTg\">@lemon-ghost-flower</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yyXJzWNkrXy1XqNR5fL5g\">@gray-coal</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mut382uTTgjv0iTf-Qzn-lQ\">@quiessilva-meriff</a> @jesusonaboat <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIc-JonhOl94pUhK_mXtjUA\">@miramet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt9geJLJmQgt0hZuryGRtmw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt9geJLJmQgt0hZuryGRtmw\">@theplacewhererobindied</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBJp15hcWG2OSpy10yjh_jQ\">@velveteen-mars</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcXHe7GBBGZJJbNIGyHEkXQ\">@cutieukeboy</a></p>",
