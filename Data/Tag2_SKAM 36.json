Eliott turns to Lucas, tilting his head to bump their heads together, swaying to the music.</p><p>The track ends and the next one is a more upbeat song with a slightly sexier tune to it. With one last look at Chloe, Eliott caresses Lucas\u2019 waist, descending his arms to his hips. He pinches Lucas\u2019 hips then pulls him closer, allowing him to grind against his boyfriend, showing his growing hard-on.  Lucas hums, tilting his head up to kiss Eliott, but Eliott has other plans. </p><p>Frustrated with his past behavior and the chaotic thoughts of Chloe raging in his head, he grabs Lucas from the waist and turns them around, shoving Lucas against the nearest wall. Lucas exhales a little laugh before finding his boyfriend\u2019s lips.  </p><p>\u201cI might be a little territorial, sue me,\u201d Eliott says between kisses.  </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take another form of payment,\u201d he whispers before sneaking his hand through the waistband of Eliott\u2019s jeans. </p><p>\u201cHOLA BITCHES!\u201d </p><p>The couple break apart, finding Alexia barging into the room with the rest of the girl squad following in pursuit. </p><p>The girls wear mischievous smiles, and a bottle of vodka between them.  </p><p>\u201cDaphne!\u201d Basile shrieks happily, rushing for his girl to embrace.
