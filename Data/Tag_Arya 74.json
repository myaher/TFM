It\u2019s was fitting her character, in the ways of not being ~royally~ meeting them and also being of the first ones to see them and of being undetected while she did so.</p><p><b>9</b>) Sansa not having any of Jon\u2019s insecurities or guilt trips and firmly confirming that she believes in him, she has faith in him.</p><p><b>10</b>) <i>- \u201cLast time we spoke was at Joffrey&rsquo;s wedding.

I liked how they had the revelation of Jon\u2019s parentage to him immediately and how Sam didn\u2019t beat around the bush or stall or anything.</p><p><b>Things I didn\u2019t like</b>:</p><p><b>1</b>) The teenage-y romance, it was ruining the episode and its pace and tone. It was so&hellip;<i>beneath </i>the episode that it ruined for me the we-all-knew-it-was-coming Jon\u2019s dragon-ride. Plus it was so stupid to say at this point that they could stay there forever &amp; no one would find them&hellip;I\u2019m sorry, aren\u2019t you the ones who claim to be the realm\u2019s saviors from an enemy that will <i>find </i>you and kill you <b>all</b>? o_0 It just feels very off to make that comment at this specific moment (and she didn\u2019t say it in a bad/I\u2019m-being-nervous-about-what\u2019s-coming joke).</p><p><b>2</b>) Having Daenerys ready to threat Sansa if she doesn\u2019t respect her. I thought Tyrion taught her a bit about patience and not taking everything with \u201cfire and blood\u201d and burning all bridges while doing so, leaving ruins behind. I think the writers did her a bit of disservice there. And if you add the fact that she was smug when her dragons first appeared over the crowd and frightened them, after she got told that the \u201cNortherners don\u2019t trust outsiders\u201d, it depicts her in a bad light. Also, her comment about being Sansa\u2019s queen! Em, what? When? A) You are not even sitting on the throne. B) Sansa pledged no such loyalty, her cousin who wanted your dragons (and also to bed you) did. <b>Demanding to be a queen and not caring to be liked (as Daenerys stated) is how you become Cersei and they already have her on the throne, they don\u2019t need another one</b>. C) She did \u201coffer\u201d you the North, though, regardless. <i>\u201cWinterfell is yours, Your Grace\u201d</i>. She just didn\u2019t fawn over you, so that\u2019s what actually bothered you, so it was about her actually <i>liking </i>you.<br/></p><p><b>3</b>) Jon not registering that fact that he slept with his aunt!! Like, are they serious? They had him thinking about being betrayed by Ned, the most <i>honourable </i>man he met (Jon\u2019s words), then about <i>treason </i>(which again speaks to <i>honour</i>) and <b>not </b>think about how there\u2019s nothing <i>honourable </i>about incest??? \n\ud83d\ude12 \ud83d\ude29 \ud83e\udd14 <br/></p><p><b>4</b>) The fact that they had spoiled the Arya/Jon reunion in the trailer. Also, the reunion itself was a hit and miss for me.\n\ud83d\ude41\n\n It was the one reunion/thing I was expecting the most and it left me \u201cmeh\u201d. It was kinda awkward. I liked Jon\u2019s with Sansa and Bran way better, much to my surprise. <br/></p>",
