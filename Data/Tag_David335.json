Beautiful days. Warm days, but with the promise of winter in the breeze. He felt even more alien, and he missed her wise words, and her laughter.</p><p>Ma.</p><p>Shame made him wipe his face hard. It had been 35 years. He stared at his wet palm. How did the tears still come so quick? There was a span of time where thoughts of her didn\u2019t torture him. He had a wife. A lovely daughter \u2026 a family of his own that he was resolved never, ever to leave.</p><p>Like you left, ma. You left us all.</p><p>In the end, they left him. His hand clenched to a fist, and another sob made his chest contract. He missed Daisy. She wouldn\u2019t let him slide back into melancholy, but she was miles away, with her mother. He was back at square one, in every way.</p><p>Back in Broadchurch, where the past was impossible to escape.</p><p>He tucked his face into his knees and concentrated on the sound of the ocean. It was the only thing left, but it flayed him. The sound, as well as the sight and smell. It was a ravaging thing, and he wanted nothing more-</p><p>He heard footsteps, and wiped his face and rolled clumsily to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAlec,\u201d she said, her brow creased with concern. She was still in scrubs, but her long hair blew loose and silky in the wind, wavy with the braid she usually wore during work. The worry in her eyes was a punch in his sick, sick gut. She must\u2019ve been in traffic for hours to come and see him.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d he said, checking his nostrils for wetness. \u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him. His beautiful eyes were pink with tears. After their second date, she knew exactly where he might be when he was MIA, because he told her. It was strange he pretended not to remember.</p><p>\u201cI called you after I got off work, like you made me promise,\u201d she started, and threw down her bag. \u201cAnd for the first time, you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d She pulled off her socks and sighed as her bare feet sank into the sand. \u201cSince you never <i>don\u2019t</i> answer-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other for three months,\u201d he interrupted gruffly. </p><p>She was visibly stung by his tone, but she walked a few steps toward the ocean and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s too cold? It\u2019s September,\u201d she said, looking back at him with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t have much experience with English beaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d he said, hugging himself. </p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d she said, eyeing the creamy foam. The sand stretched smooth and wet for miles. \u201cIt\u2019s inviting. Now that I found you, walk with me for a bit?\u201d He grunted. Undaunted, she held out her hand. </p><p>\u201cSeriously. It\u2019s really cold,\u201d he said. His lower lip stuck out. \u201cYou\u2019ll get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily, I work in a hospital,\u201d she said, and winked at him. \u201cCome on. Look at that sand. After 14 hours of work, my feet are aching to sink into it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get wet,\u201d he said, but his arms rested at his sides now.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. You can walk in the dry sand, I\u2019ll walk in the damp. Deal?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, then nodded. They walked quietly for five minutes, then there was a sharp intake of breath as an errant wave swirled high over her ankles.</p><p>\u201cTold you it\u2019s cold,\u201d he said, but he stopped. \u201cYou okay?\u201d He eyed her soaked scrubs. The wind was getting sharper.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m used to the cold. I grew up in the midwest, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe midwest,\u201d he repeated, fascinated. \u201cSo strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she said, rolling her wet scrubs higher on her legs. Her ankles were pale with the cold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It shouldn\u2019t be. We have regions here too. Sussex. Wessex. Yorkshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019 dirry tell ya?\u201d she said in a deliberately terrible Yorkshire accent. \u201cThere\u2019s the \u2018ole world at yer feet. And who gets to see it but the birds, the stars, and the chimney sweeps.\u201d She bent her knees and slapped her thigh like Dick Van Dyke.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAwful. But I have a soft spot for Mary Poppins. It was the first film my ma-\u201d his mouth snapped shut, and his face crumpled tellingly. She touched his face, but he shrugged off her hand.</p><p>\u201cAlec, why are you here?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2026 at the beach?\u201d he said. He fixed his face and stuffed his hands in his pockets. His body language was stiff and remote, and she hated it. She longed for his warmth, but she wouldn\u2019t force it. She felt like an interloper. After what they already shared, the sensation was deeply uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe, still in Broadchurch?\u201d she said carefully. Now she hugged herself. Another wave reached them, and the cold water made her shiver. He gently pulled her from the wet sand and sat down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI once had a reason to stay, but now \u2026\u201d he sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left. Yet I feel bound to the place, somehow.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and stared at him as he stared out at the sea. His windblown hair, thick and threaded with silver, was speckled with sand. How long had he been holding vigil by the water? Her mouth filled with saliva when she wondered whether his lips would be salty if she kissed him. And she wanted to, and eat away at the pain that bound him to that place. She was accustomed to aching. But he was fragile, and lovely. He wasn\u2019t built for it.</p><p>She stared so intently she didn\u2019t notice he was looking back at her with equal concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he said, and tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI drove four hours because you didn\u2019t text back,\u201d she said, and rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not creepy.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a crooked grin. \u201cMaybe. But the truth is, I don\u2019t not text back. At least, with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, you have that look,\u201d she said, and leaned into him. </p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d he said, putting his hand on his chest with mock indignation. He hoped his change in tone would soothe her worry.</p><p>\u201cLike the kind of person who changes numbers and don\u2019t let their friends know for a while,\u201d she said. His eyebrows rose, and he sucked his teeth. </p><p>\u201cHave you been talking to Ellie?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never spoken. You told me about that, remember?\u201d she said, and sifted the honey-colored sand through her fingers. She watched the sun sink into the water, then turned to him. \u201cNot that it matters. You\u2019re always present for me.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face, and her hand ghosted over his jawline, then settled on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYour skin is tight with salt,\u201d she said, and licked the pad of her thumb and rubbed by his nose, where the tears left hoary lines on his skin. She stopped and sucked her thumb. \u201cSorry. That was gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He warmed to her unconscious tenderness.</p><p>\u201cYou made a face,\u201d she said, and bit her thumb. He was salty, but she didn\u2019t taste seawater. Her eyes shone with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, and looked at her hands. She felt like burying her head in the sand. Or just going home. His hand slid into her field of vision, and he grabbed one and moved it back to his face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind it,\u201d he said. She rubbed at the camel freckles on his cheek. His skin was so soft, despite the creases. And his eyes \u2026 they were beautiful. Intense. Deep. And so goddamned sad. Her mouth formed into a swollen O. She wanted to kiss him, half bury him in the sand with her passion. \u00a0She felt selfish for it. Was selfish. </p><p>\u201cI should go. It was crazy coming here like this. This is your place, your time. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quickly, and stood up. </p><p>He jumped up. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s only been three months. What do I know?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll just grab my very unfashionable shoes and be on my way. You can give me a call later, if you like.\u201d She walked, and for 20 steps, he watched her. The first stars of the night shone intermittently over her head. She drove four hours because she was worried. About him. His ex grumbled if she had to ride seven minutes to pick him up from work when she had the car.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he said, and ran to her. He hugged her from behind, holding her tightly against his chest. His breaths made her cheek damp. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms and wrapped hers around his waist. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, running her fingers through his hair. \u201cHow did I know that what other people said about you was bullshit at first glance? It was a feeling I got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drove four hours in shite traffic for a feeling?\u201d he said. He rubbed her back, more and more grateful every second for her warmth.</p><p>\u201cWas I wrong?\u201d she said, tipping her head to the side and looking at him. Again, she rubbed at the tear trails on his face. </p><p>He looked down, then back at her. \u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She licked her lips, then got on tiptoes to kiss the salt from his cheeks. He leaned into her and closed his eyes. She kissed his closed eyelids, then his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she said, and finally pressed her mouth to his. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone anymore, Alec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlec,\u201d he repeated, and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to hearing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to call you that,\u201d she said, and kissed him again, letting her lips linger.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and his hand moved underneath her scrubs to touch her bare back. \u201cI\u2019m getting used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call you Hardy like everyone else,\u201d she said into his mouth as she unbuttoned his jacket and slid her arms underneath it. </p><p>He pulled away and shook his head.\u201dNo. Everyone else calls me that. You\u2019re not everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that since I first saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d she said, and bit her lip. She wanted to tell him her secrets so badly she trembled. He opened himself up so beautifully to her. He deserved the whole truth, but fear silenced her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said with conviction, and swept her in his arms in a deep, lingering kiss that left them both breathless. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being a bastard earlier.\u201d He licked his lips. Her hands were fists on his lapels.</p><p>\u201cTake me to your cottage,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be at work at 6am tomorrow, but I want to warm your bed first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said earlier. The three months thing. It\u2019s been the best three months in a very, very, very long time,\u201d he said more earnestly, taking her face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cNow, Alec. Moonlight\u2019s burning,\u201d she said, and softly bit his lower lip. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven, darling. Now take me to bed. I can comfort you way better there.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and pulled her toward the parking lot, where only their cars waited - there was no one else around. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you,\u201d she said, and kissed his nose before getting into her car. He knocked on the window, and she lowered the glass.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cFor coming. For being so good to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m learning from the best,\u201d she said, tracing his lips tenderly. \u201cNow take me to yours, and out of these wet clothes.\u201d</p><hr><p>If you\u2019ve read The Sea Inside, you most probably noticed that Grace/Clara calls him Alec. A lot. And for many, it\u2019s quite OOC, since he hates being called Alec. It\u2019s, like, totally canon. </p><p>But\u2026</p><p>What if the reason he dislikes using his name isn\u2019t what people think it is? It\u2019s not necessarily disdain for what his parents called him, but him trying to protect himself from painful memories?

Beautiful days. Warm days, but with the promise of winter in the breeze. He felt even more alien, and he missed her wise words, and her laughter.</p><p>Ma.</p><p>Shame made him wipe his face hard. It had been 35 years. He stared at his wet palm. How did the tears still come so quick? There was a span of time where thoughts of her didn\u2019t torture him. He had a wife. A lovely daughter \u2026 a family of his own that he was resolved never, ever to leave.</p><p>Like you left, ma. You left us all.</p><p>In the end, they left him. His hand clenched to a fist, and another sob made his chest contract. He missed Daisy. She wouldn\u2019t let him slide back into melancholy, but she was miles away, with her mother. He was back at square one, in every way.</p><p>Back in Broadchurch, where the past was impossible to escape.</p><p>He tucked his face into his knees and concentrated on the sound of the ocean. It was the only thing left, but it flayed him. The sound, as well as the sight and smell. It was a ravaging thing, and he wanted nothing more-</p><p>He heard footsteps, and wiped his face and rolled clumsily to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAlec,\u201d she said, her brow creased with concern. She was still in scrubs, but her long hair blew loose and silky in the wind, wavy with the braid she usually wore during work. The worry in her eyes was a punch in his sick, sick gut. She must\u2019ve been in traffic for hours to come and see him.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d he said, checking his nostrils for wetness. \u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him. His beautiful eyes were pink with tears. After their second date, she knew exactly where he might be when he was MIA, because he told her. It was strange he pretended not to remember.</p><p>\u201cI called you after I got off work, like you made me promise,\u201d she started, and threw down her bag. \u201cAnd for the first time, you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d She pulled off her socks and sighed as her bare feet sank into the sand. \u201cSince you never <i>don\u2019t</i> answer-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other for three months,\u201d he interrupted gruffly. </p><p>She was visibly stung by his tone, but she walked a few steps toward the ocean and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s too cold? It\u2019s September,\u201d she said, looking back at him with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t have much experience with English beaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d he said, hugging himself. </p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d she said, eyeing the creamy foam. The sand stretched smooth and wet for miles. \u201cIt\u2019s inviting. Now that I found you, walk with me for a bit?\u201d He grunted. Undaunted, she held out her hand. </p><p>\u201cSeriously. It\u2019s really cold,\u201d he said. His lower lip stuck out. \u201cYou\u2019ll get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily, I work in a hospital,\u201d she said, and winked at him. \u201cCome on. Look at that sand. After 14 hours of work, my feet are aching to sink into it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get wet,\u201d he said, but his arms rested at his sides now.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. You can walk in the dry sand, I\u2019ll walk in the damp. Deal?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, then nodded. They walked quietly for five minutes, then there was a sharp intake of breath as an errant wave swirled high over her ankles.</p><p>\u201cTold you it\u2019s cold,\u201d he said, but he stopped. \u201cYou okay?\u201d He eyed her soaked scrubs. The wind was getting sharper.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m used to the cold. I grew up in the midwest, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe midwest,\u201d he repeated, fascinated. \u201cSo strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she said, rolling her wet scrubs higher on her legs. Her ankles were pale with the cold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It shouldn\u2019t be. We have regions here too. Sussex. Wessex. Yorkshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019 dirry tell ya?\u201d she said in a deliberately terrible Yorkshire accent. \u201cThere\u2019s the \u2018ole world at yer feet. And who gets to see it but the birds, the stars, and the chimney sweeps.\u201d She bent her knees and slapped her thigh like Dick Van Dyke.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAwful. But I have a soft spot for Mary Poppins. It was the first film my ma-\u201d his mouth snapped shut, and his face crumpled tellingly. She touched his face, but he shrugged off her hand.</p><p>\u201cAlec, why are you here?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2026 at the beach?\u201d he said. He fixed his face and stuffed his hands in his pockets. His body language was stiff and remote, and she hated it. She longed for his warmth, but she wouldn\u2019t force it. She felt like an interloper. After what they already shared, the sensation was deeply uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe, still in Broadchurch?\u201d she said carefully. Now she hugged herself. Another wave reached them, and the cold water made her shiver. He gently pulled her from the wet sand and sat down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI once had a reason to stay, but now \u2026\u201d he sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left. Yet I feel bound to the place, somehow.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and stared at him as he stared out at the sea. His windblown hair, thick and threaded with silver, was speckled with sand. How long had he been holding vigil by the water? Her mouth filled with saliva when she wondered whether his lips would be salty if she kissed him. And she wanted to, and eat away at the pain that bound him to that place. She was accustomed to aching. But he was fragile, and lovely. He wasn\u2019t built for it.</p><p>She stared so intently she didn\u2019t notice he was looking back at her with equal concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he said, and tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI drove four hours because you didn\u2019t text back,\u201d she said, and rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not creepy.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a crooked grin. \u201cMaybe. But the truth is, I don\u2019t not text back. At least, with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, you have that look,\u201d she said, and leaned into him. </p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d he said, putting his hand on his chest with mock indignation. He hoped his change in tone would soothe her worry.</p><p>\u201cLike the kind of person who changes numbers and don\u2019t let their friends know for a while,\u201d she said. His eyebrows rose, and he sucked his teeth. </p><p>\u201cHave you been talking to Ellie?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never spoken. You told me about that, remember?\u201d she said, and sifted the honey-colored sand through her fingers. She watched the sun sink into the water, then turned to him. \u201cNot that it matters. You\u2019re always present for me.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face, and her hand ghosted over his jawline, then settled on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYour skin is tight with salt,\u201d she said, and licked the pad of her thumb and rubbed by his nose, where the tears left hoary lines on his skin.

His hand clenched to a fist, and another sob made his chest contract. He missed Daisy. She wouldn\u2019t let him slide back into melancholy, but she was miles away, with her mother. He was back at square one, in every way.</p><p>Back in Broadchurch, where the past was impossible to escape.</p><p>He tucked his face into his knees and concentrated on the sound of the ocean. It was the only thing left, but it flayed him. The sound, as well as the sight and smell. It was a ravaging thing, and he wanted nothing more-</p><p>He heard footsteps, and wiped his face and rolled clumsily to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAlec,\u201d she said, her brow creased with concern. She was still in scrubs, but her long hair blew loose and silky in the wind, wavy with the braid she usually wore during work. The worry in her eyes was a punch in his sick, sick gut. She must\u2019ve been in traffic for hours to come and see him.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d he said, checking his nostrils for wetness. \u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him. His beautiful eyes were pink with tears. After their second date, she knew exactly where he might be when he was MIA, because he told her. It was strange he pretended not to remember.</p><p>\u201cI called you after I got off work, like you made me promise,\u201d she started, and threw down her bag. \u201cAnd for the first time, you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d She pulled off her socks and sighed as her bare feet sank into the sand. \u201cSince you never <i>don\u2019t</i> answer-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other for three months,\u201d he interrupted gruffly. </p><p>She was visibly stung by his tone, but she walked a few steps toward the ocean and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s too cold? It\u2019s September,\u201d she said, looking back at him with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t have much experience with English beaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d he said, hugging himself. </p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d she said, eyeing the creamy foam. The sand stretched smooth and wet for miles. \u201cIt\u2019s inviting. Now that I found you, walk with me for a bit?\u201d He grunted. Undaunted, she held out her hand. </p><p>\u201cSeriously. It\u2019s really cold,\u201d he said. His lower lip stuck out. \u201cYou\u2019ll get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily, I work in a hospital,\u201d she said, and winked at him. \u201cCome on. Look at that sand. After 14 hours of work, my feet are aching to sink into it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get wet,\u201d he said, but his arms rested at his sides now.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. You can walk in the dry sand, I\u2019ll walk in the damp. Deal?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, then nodded. They walked quietly for five minutes, then there was a sharp intake of breath as an errant wave swirled high over her ankles.</p><p>\u201cTold you it\u2019s cold,\u201d he said, but he stopped. \u201cYou okay?\u201d He eyed her soaked scrubs. The wind was getting sharper.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m used to the cold. I grew up in the midwest, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe midwest,\u201d he repeated, fascinated. \u201cSo strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she said, rolling her wet scrubs higher on her legs. Her ankles were pale with the cold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It shouldn\u2019t be. We have regions here too. Sussex. Wessex. Yorkshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019 dirry tell ya?\u201d she said in a deliberately terrible Yorkshire accent. \u201cThere\u2019s the \u2018ole world at yer feet. And who gets to see it but the birds, the stars, and the chimney sweeps.\u201d She bent her knees and slapped her thigh like Dick Van Dyke.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAwful. But I have a soft spot for Mary Poppins. It was the first film my ma-\u201d his mouth snapped shut, and his face crumpled tellingly. She touched his face, but he shrugged off her hand.</p><p>\u201cAlec, why are you here?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2026 at the beach?\u201d he said. He fixed his face and stuffed his hands in his pockets. His body language was stiff and remote, and she hated it. She longed for his warmth, but she wouldn\u2019t force it. She felt like an interloper. After what they already shared, the sensation was deeply uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe, still in Broadchurch?\u201d she said carefully. Now she hugged herself. Another wave reached them, and the cold water made her shiver. He gently pulled her from the wet sand and sat down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI once had a reason to stay, but now \u2026\u201d he sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left. Yet I feel bound to the place, somehow.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and stared at him as he stared out at the sea. His windblown hair, thick and threaded with silver, was speckled with sand. How long had he been holding vigil by the water? Her mouth filled with saliva when she wondered whether his lips would be salty if she kissed him. And she wanted to, and eat away at the pain that bound him to that place. She was accustomed to aching. But he was fragile, and lovely. He wasn\u2019t built for it.</p><p>She stared so intently she didn\u2019t notice he was looking back at her with equal concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he said, and tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI drove four hours because you didn\u2019t text back,\u201d she said, and rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not creepy.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a crooked grin. \u201cMaybe. But the truth is, I don\u2019t not text back. At least, with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, you have that look,\u201d she said, and leaned into him. </p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d he said, putting his hand on his chest with mock indignation. He hoped his change in tone would soothe her worry.</p><p>\u201cLike the kind of person who changes numbers and don\u2019t let their friends know for a while,\u201d she said. His eyebrows rose, and he sucked his teeth. </p><p>\u201cHave you been talking to Ellie?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never spoken. You told me about that, remember?\u201d she said, and sifted the honey-colored sand through her fingers. She watched the sun sink into the water, then turned to him. \u201cNot that it matters. You\u2019re always present for me.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face, and her hand ghosted over his jawline, then settled on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYour skin is tight with salt,\u201d she said, and licked the pad of her thumb and rubbed by his nose, where the tears left hoary lines on his skin. She stopped and sucked her thumb. \u201cSorry. That was gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He warmed to her unconscious tenderness.</p><p>\u201cYou made a face,\u201d she said, and bit her thumb. He was salty, but she didn\u2019t taste seawater. Her eyes shone with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, and looked at her hands. She felt like burying her head in the sand. Or just going home. His hand slid into her field of vision, and he grabbed one and moved it back to his face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind it,\u201d he said. She rubbed at the camel freckles on his cheek. His skin was so soft, despite the creases. And his eyes \u2026 they were beautiful. Intense. Deep. And so goddamned sad. Her mouth formed into a swollen O. She wanted to kiss him, half bury him in the sand with her passion. \u00a0She felt selfish for it. Was selfish. </p><p>\u201cI should go. It was crazy coming here like this. This is your place, your time. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quickly, and stood up. </p><p>He jumped up. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s only been three months. What do I know?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll just grab my very unfashionable shoes and be on my way. You can give me a call later, if you like.\u201d She walked, and for 20 steps, he watched her. The first stars of the night shone intermittently over her head. She drove four hours because she was worried. About him. His ex grumbled if she had to ride seven minutes to pick him up from work when she had the car.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he said, and ran to her. He hugged her from behind, holding her tightly against his chest. His breaths made her cheek damp. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms and wrapped hers around his waist. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, running her fingers through his hair. \u201cHow did I know that what other people said about you was bullshit at first glance? It was a feeling I got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drove four hours in shite traffic for a feeling?\u201d he said. He rubbed her back, more and more grateful every second for her warmth.</p><p>\u201cWas I wrong?\u201d she said, tipping her head to the side and looking at him. Again, she rubbed at the tear trails on his face. </p><p>He looked down, then back at her. \u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She licked her lips, then got on tiptoes to kiss the salt from his cheeks. He leaned into her and closed his eyes. She kissed his closed eyelids, then his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she said, and finally pressed her mouth to his. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone anymore, Alec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlec,\u201d he repeated, and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to hearing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to call you that,\u201d she said, and kissed him again, letting her lips linger.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and his hand moved underneath her scrubs to touch her bare back. \u201cI\u2019m getting used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call you Hardy like everyone else,\u201d she said into his mouth as she unbuttoned his jacket and slid her arms underneath it. </p><p>He pulled away and shook his head.\u201dNo. Everyone else calls me that. You\u2019re not everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that since I first saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d she said, and bit her lip. She wanted to tell him her secrets so badly she trembled. He opened himself up so beautifully to her. He deserved the whole truth, but fear silenced her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said with conviction, and swept her in his arms in a deep, lingering kiss that left them both breathless. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being a bastard earlier.\u201d He licked his lips. Her hands were fists on his lapels.</p><p>\u201cTake me to your cottage,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be at work at 6am tomorrow, but I want to warm your bed first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said earlier. The three months thing. It\u2019s been the best three months in a very, very, very long time,\u201d he said more earnestly, taking her face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cNow, Alec. Moonlight\u2019s burning,\u201d she said, and softly bit his lower lip. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven, darling. Now take me to bed. I can comfort you way better there.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and pulled her toward the parking lot, where only their cars waited - there was no one else around. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you,\u201d she said, and kissed his nose before getting into her car. He knocked on the window, and she lowered the glass.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cFor coming. For being so good to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m learning from the best,\u201d she said, tracing his lips tenderly. \u201cNow take me to yours, and out of these wet clothes.\u201d</p><hr><p>If you\u2019ve read The Sea Inside, you most probably noticed that Grace/Clara calls him Alec. A lot. And for many, it\u2019s quite OOC, since he hates being called Alec. It\u2019s, like, totally canon. </p><p>But\u2026</p><p>What if the reason he dislikes using his name isn\u2019t what people think it is? It\u2019s not necessarily disdain for what his parents called him, but him trying to protect himself from painful memories? Maybe he doesn\u2019t dislike it, but random folks calling him what his mother called him is intensely distasteful to him.</p><p>I went with that. </p></p>",
