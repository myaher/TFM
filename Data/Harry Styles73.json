Her whole body was numb, she\ncouldn\u2019t face the idea of losing this baby, but she was positive that that was\nwhat was happening right now. Harry followed her out of the bathroom and in\ninto the kitchen grabbing his car keys and wallet off the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou need to bring love?\u201d he picked her hand bag off it\u2019s hook and held it up to\nher \u201cjust this?\u201d She nodded, unable to form any words, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go\u201d</p><p>She\nfollowed him down stairs to his range rover and he helped her get in on the\npassenger side before running to the driver side and hoping in himself. Neither\nof them said a word the entire drive, letting the radio fill the silence. Poppy\ncould feel her stomach cramping and she was getting more and more worried the\nlonger that they sat in the busy London traffic. Half an hour later, Harry\npulled into the hospital carpark, finding a space close to the entrance of the\nA &amp; E and pulled the keys out of the ignition. He paused for a moment with\nthe keys in his lap, watching as Poppy looked out the window</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s\ngoing to be ok Pop\u201d he leant over and placed a kiss to her cheek \u201cI promise\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make\npromises you can\u2019t keep Harry\u201d she opened the door and got out of the car,\nmaking her way inside while Harry tried to catch up.</p><p>When they\ngot inside they were greeted by a man, who Poppy assumed was a nurse by the way\nhe was dressed \u201cGood afternoon Miss, what\u2019s brought you into A&amp;E today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh, I\u2019m\npregnant, and I\u2019ve had some bleeding tonight\u201d</p><p>He gave her\na sympathetic smile \u201cI\u2019ll page someone from the early pregnancy unit and we\u2019ll\nget you checked out as soon as possible, just take a seat and someone will call\nyou through soon\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nHarry said as they turned and found a seat in the corner away from the old man\nthat was coughing and spluttering everywhere. Poppy leant her head against\nHarry\u2019s shoulder and waited for her name to be called.</p><p>\u201cMiss\nThomas\u201d a friendly looking nurse called herr name ten minutes later and both\nPoppy and Harry stood making their way over to her \u201cI\u2019m sorry Sir\u201d she said\nlooking at Harry \u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay out here, there\u2019s just not enough room in\nthere\u201d Poppy gave him a worried look and he smiled reassuringly, squeezing her\nhand</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be\nright out here the whole-time love\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep\nyou posted\u201d the nurse smiled at him and lead Poppy into consultation room</p><p>\u201cOk Lovey,\nso I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re experiencing some bleeding, how far along are you?\u201d\nshe gestured towards the chair, inviting her to sit down</p><p>\u201cAlmost 10\nweeks\u201d</p><p>She nodded,\ntaking a look at her notes \u201cright, well it is quite normal to experience light\nbleeding in these early stages of pregnancy, so I don\u2019t want you to worry\nyourself, but since your condition makes you high risk, we\u2019ll do a quick scan\ntoday and make sure everything\u2019s ok\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nPoppy nodded</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome lovey, come through this way with me and we\u2019ll go and find a free\nultrasound machine\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nfollowed her down the long hallway as she popped her head in a few doors before\nfinally turning the lights on in one room and ushered Poppy inside.</p><p>\u201cBingo!\u201d\nshe laughed, trying to lighten the mood \u201calright, you lie down on that bed\nthere, and get comfortable, and I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes with Tony our\nradiographer\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d\nPoppy smiled, and true to her word, a few minutes later she walked back in with\na scrawny man, who would have been in his mid-fifties with a beard that kind of\nreminded Poppy of her dads.</p><p>\u201cMiss\nThomas\u201d he held his hand out and shook hers \u201cI\u2019m Tony, we\u2019re going to check\nthat little bub in there is doing alright\u201d he sat down on the stool that sat\nnext to the machine and searched for the bottle of gel \u201cHave you had a scan\nyet?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had\ntwo\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo!\nAlready!\u201d he laughed \u201cwell you know the drill then\u201d he smiled \u201cI\u2019ll try and get\nan image externally, but this early on it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s going on so we\nmight have to have a little look inside\u201d he shook the bottle of gel and lifted\nbottom of her shirt \u201cthis might be a little cold\u201d</p><p>He squeezed\nthe gel onto her stomach and used the probe to move it around a little before\nturning the machine on. Poppy closed her eyes, because she knew that looking at\nthe screen would freak her out and waited for the sound of the heartbeat, but\nit never came.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s\nlooking good Miss Thomas\u201d Tony said and she opened her eyes</p><p>\u201cBut the\nheartbeat?\u201d she questioned shyly</p><p>He smiled\n\u201cit can be a little hard to hear this early on externally, but if you have a\nlook at the screen here, you can see it\u2019s little heart beating\u201d she moved her\nhead to have a look at the screen and saw the slight flashing where Tony was pointing,\nand a big smile spread across her face. She\u2019d never been so happy to see a tiny\nflashing blob in her life, tears filled her eyes and she let out a little laugh\nat how silly she felt for crying.</p><p>After\ncleaning the gel off her belly and helping her sit up Tony walked out of the\nroom and left her with her nurse.</p><p>\u201cAlright\nMiss Thomas, so now that we all know you\u2019re not having a miscarriage you can\nrelax a little, but we\u2019d still like to know what\u2019s causing the bleeding so I\u2019m\ngoing to page our on call obstetrician to have a look at these and we\u2019ll go\nfrom there\u201d she smiled at her \u201cI\u2019ll take you back out to the waiting room and\nyou can tell Dad the good news, he was white as a ghost when I came out to get\nyou\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she\nlaughed \u201che gets worried easily.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to correct her when she\ncalled Harry the baby\u2019s Dad, he was the closest thing that this baby had to a\nfather and she knew he didn\u2019t care if people thought it was his.</p><p>The nurse\nwalked her back out to the waiting room, where Harry was still sitting in the\ncorner, staring intensely at his phone. He heard the doors open and saw Poppy\nwalk out, standing up and making his way quickly towards her, a worried\nexpression on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEverything\nok?\u201d he asked, panic evident in his voice</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a\nlittle trooper in there H\u201d she said walking back to the chair in the corner and\npatting the seat next to her, telling Harry to come and sit down again. </p><p>\u201cSo\neverything\u2019s ok?\u201d he said softly, aware that everyone was listening to them,\nand taking his seat next to Poppy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\nhaving a miscarriage\u201d she whispered back \u201cbut they don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bleeding,\nso we have to wait for the obstetrician to have a look at my scan\u201d</p><p>He nodded\nand grabbed her hand \u201cI told you everything would be okay, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She giggled\n\u201cYou did, I\u2019m sorry for being a bitch to you in the car, I know you were trying\nto help\u201d She leant her head on his shoulder and put her hand on her belly</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok\nlove, I didn\u2019t take it to heart\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nshe closed her eyes for a brief second, glad that Harry was around when she\nstarted bleeding, knowing that without him to force her out the door she would\nhave turned completely numb. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay H, I know you had things\nto do tonight\u201d with his tour coming up, he rarely had a free night, with\nrehearsals and meetings to make sure that everything was perfect from the very\nfirst show, so she felt guilty for making him sit here with her when everything\nwas fine.</p><p> \u201cI already called everyone and cancelled\ntonight\u2019s rehearsal, you can\u2019t get rid of me that easily love\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank You\u201d\nshe smiled at him \u201cDon\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d He smiled back, rubbing\nhis thumb against her forearm in a comforting manner.</p><p>The wait\nthis time wasn\u2019t short, they saw a few patients come in and out while they sat\npatiently reading through magazines that sat on the coffee table. \u00a0It was\ngetting late and Poppy had had a busy day at work, filled with meetings and\nconference calls trying to make the schedule for the Live Lounge Month work for\nas many people as possible. Herr eyes were getting heavy and she leant her head\non Harry\u2019s shoulder trying her best to stay awake.</p><p>\u201cClose your\neyes love\u201d he whispered \u201cI\u2019ll wake you up when they call your name\u201d. She gave\nin as Harry began stroking her hair, letting herself drift off to sleep right\nthere on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\u201d she\nheard Harry whisper into her ear what felt like minutes later \u201cPoppy, the\ndoctor\u2019s ready to see you now\u201d she blinked a few times adjusting to the harsh\nlighting of the A&amp;E waiting room and lifted her head seeing the\nobstetrician standing next to the doors to the consulting room. She looked at\nher phone as she stood up and made her way over to the doctor, and saw that it\nwas 10:30pm now and she\u2019d been asleep for two hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr\nMarshall\u201d he said with his arm outstretched \u201cSorry about the wait, I had a few\nlabouring mothers\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok\u201d\nshe smiled</p><p>\u201cDad can\ncome in too this time\u201d he pointed at Harry who was looking at something on his\nphone</p><p>Poppy\nsmiled and turned around, looking at Harry trying to gain his attention without\ncalling his name across the room filled with people who might recognise him.\n\u201cH\u201d she said loud enough for him to hear her but not so loud that the entire\nroom would hear as well. He looked up and saw her calling him over and immediately\nstood up from his seat, putting his phone in his back pocket and making his way\nover to her. He took her hand and they both followed the doctor into the\nconsulting room where he invited them both to take a seat.</p><p>\u201cNow\u201d he\nsaid, taking a seat himself \u201cI took a look at your scan and reviewed your\nprevious bloodwork and you\u2019ve got absolutely nothing to worry about\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\nrelief\u201d Harry said</p><p>\u201cIt looks\nlike your bleeding is simply a result of your heart shaped uterus, the right\nside, where the baby isn\u2019t sitting, appears to be shedding some of it\u2019s lining,\nwhich is normal, but we don\u2019t want to happen to the other side, so I\u2019m going to\nprescribe you something to stop the bleeding\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s\nsafe, for the baby?\u201d Poppy asked</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d\nhe nodded, writing something on his prescription pad, and handing it to her\n\u201cI\u2019ll add all this to your notes and make sure that your regular obstetrician\ngets them\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nshe nodded, taking the script from him</p><p>\u201cIt might\ntake a few days for the bleeding to stop, but if it gets any heavier, please\ncome back in\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\nthanks\u201d she said standing up from her chair as he opened the door for them</p><p>\u201cThanks for\nall your help tonight\u201d Harry said shaking his hand as he walked out the door.\nThey both made their way out to Harry\u2019s car joking about how serious Dr\nMarshall had seemed in the few minutes that they\u2019d seen him. The drive home was\nmuch more relaxed and without the busy evening traffic it was much shorter too\nand they\u2019d made it home before Poppy knew it. Harry pulled up right outside her\nbuilding, something he only did when he wasn\u2019t going to be staying long.</p><p>\u201cNot\nstaying tonight H?\u201d she asked, a little disappointed</p><p>\u201cCourse I\nam, just don\u2019t want you walking too far\u201d he smiled at her and stepped out of\nthe range rover jogging over to her side to help her out</p><p>\u201cI can get\nout of the car myself you know\u201d she giggled as he shut the door behind her</p><p>\u201cI know,\nbut you\u2019re fragile tonight\u201d he walked her into the apartment, carrying her\nhandbag for her as she unlocked the door revealing the mess they\u2019d left, \u201cI\u2019ll\nclean up\u201d Harry said looking around at all the dirty dishes left from their\ndinner \u201cyou go and make yourself comfortable\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na shower and washed away the stress of the day, taking herr time and letting\nthe hot water brush over her skin. When she finally finished she put on an old\npair of pyjama shorts and a t-shirt and made her way back into the kitchen,\nfinding that Harry had washed all the dishes and was currently making them both\na cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cFeel\nbetter now?\u201d he asked, pouring the boiling water in the cups</p><p>\u201cA little\u201d\nshe nodded, looking through her bag for the pills the doctor had prescribed for\nher putting one in her mouth and swallowing it. They both sat down to drink the\ntea that Harry had made and talked for a little while longer, before they got\ntoo tired to stay awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nH, I\u2019ve got to go bed\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too\u201d he\nyawned and followed her into the bedroom. The faint sound of Harry breathing\nagainst the pillow lulled Poppy to sleep quickly. Being pregnant was exhausting\nand on top of the day she\u2019d had, she felt like she needed three days of sleep,\nbut tomorrow was another day and she still had a job to get to in the morning.</p><p>***</p><p>Poppy was\nsitting at her desk the next day, a cup of tea next to her laptop and a\nblueberry and cream cheese cronut to go with it. She\u2019d only been at work for a\nfew hours and she\u2019d already had two meetings with Big Boss Ben about who they\nwould be inviting for the live lounge month and how they were going to work out\nthe schedule, he was adamant that all the performances should happen live as\nthey air and she couldn\u2019t seem to convince him of the scheduling nightmare that\nthat would be. He\u2019d asked her to put together a rough draft of a timetable with\nthe artists that had already confirmed their availability and that\u2019s what she\nwas doing when her phone rang. It wasn\u2019t a number that she had saved in her\nphone, and usually she didn\u2019t answer numbers she didn\u2019t know, but considering\nthe events of last night, she picked up, just in case.</p><p>\u201cHello\u201d she\nsaid, into the phone</p><p>\u201cHi is this\nPoppy Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nspeaking\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Miss\nThomas, I\u2019m calling with the results of your harmony test\u201d she\u2019d had the harmony\ntest done a few days after Harry had told her not to worry about the money side\nof things, and she was told that they would call her with the results in a few\nweeks, but if she was honest, after last night, she\u2019d forgotten all about it.</p><p>\u201cOh great\u201d\nshe said cheerfully \u201cis everything ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\npregnancy is low risk for genetic abnormalities\u201d</p><p>A huge wave\nof relief washed over her \u201cthat\u2019s great news\u201d she breathed </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll\nbe welcoming a baby boy into the world\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\nboy!\u201d she exclaimed, a little louder than she meant, causing Ella to turn\naround and look at her, raising her eyebrows</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy\nMiss Thomas, congratulations\u201d</p><p>She cleared\nher throat, trying to choke back the tears \u201cThank you for your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome, good luck with everything\u201d she ended the call and turned back to her\nscheduling nightmare, trying to ignore Ella\u2019s sharp stares. After a few minutes\nof radio silence, she stood up from her chair and walked around to the front of\nPoppy\u2019s desk, kneeling and placing her face in her hands, with elbows resting\non the desk, batting her eyelids like a child that wants something from their\nparents.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\npregnant\u201d she said matter-of-factly, in an angelic tone.</p><p>Poppy\nlooked up from her laptop, trying to hold back a smile \u201cI\u2019m not\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up\nPoppy\u201d she stood up \u201cyou can\u2019t deny it, you\u2019re having a baby\u201d she was walking\nback to her desk and talking very loudly \u201cand it\u2019s a boy\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk fine\u201d\nPoppy whispered, letting herself smile \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, but don\u2019t tell anyone,\nit\u2019s still early\u201d</p><p>If Ella was\nbad at anything it was keeping things a secret, so Poppy didn\u2019t have high hopes\nfor her pregnancy remaining between herself and Harry. Just as she sat down in\nher chair again Grimmy walked out of the hallway, just having finished his show.</p><p>\u201cGrim!\u201d she\nexclaimed \u201cPoppy\u2019s pregnant\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes and watched the expression on his face go from shock to\nexcitement in a matter of seconds \u201cWhat! Now way\u201d he walked over to where she\nwas sitting \u201cCongratulations\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a\nboy\u201d Ella chimed in as Grimmy hugged her</p><p>\u201cElla\u201d\nPoppy said, slightly annoyed \u201cremember when I said not to tell anyone\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nGrimmy, he doesn\u2019t count\u201d she shrugged</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\ntell\u201d he chimed in \u201cpromise\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes at both of them, knowing that Grimmy had a louder mouth than\nElla and by this afternoon the entirety of Radio 1 would know her secret.</p><p>\u201cSo, who\u2019s\nthe baby daddy?\u201d Ella asked</p><p>\u201cOh please,\nit\u2019s Harry\u201d Grimmy said, looking at Poppy, like he knew her entire life story</p><p>\u201cIt is not\nHarry!\u201d she exclaimed, gently pushing him</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s\ndefinitely Harry, you haven\u2019t stopped talking about him this past month\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u201d\nshe rolled her eyes again \u201cYou two can go ahead believing that it\u2019s Harry and\nI\u2019ll get on with my work and keep the details of my wild night to myself\u201d she\nturned back to her laptop and stared at the empty schedule, her mind a little\nblurry with excitement from finding out that the little spud was going to be a\nboy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want\nto know about your wild night with Harry thanks, I already know too much about\nthat kids sex life\u201d Grimmy laughed</p><p>\u201cHey you\nmight not, but I do, dude\u2019s an Adonis\u201d Ella said, shutting Poppy\u2019s laptop\nslightly</p><p>\u201cOh My God\u201d\nshe sighed \u201cDon\u2019t you two have work to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes boss\u201d\nthey both said in unison, Ella turning back to her desk and Grimmy walking back\nto his studio, waving as he left.</p><p>The rest of\nthe day ran smoothly, Poppy was able to get a rough schedule completed and\nconvince Ben that some artists would need to pre-record their performances,\nhanding him a list of the artists that weren\u2019t available during September to\nperform live. By the time 5pm rolled around, she finished writing the\nannouncement for the website and drafted the script for each radio host that\nwould be advertising it. As she was packing up her desk for the day, she sent\nHarry a text, excited to tell him the news.</p><p><i>\u201cYou free\nfor dinner tonight?

According to the app, Little Spud was the size\nof a cumquat, his vital organs were forming and functional and his fingers had\nprobably separated with fingernails starting to form. She held onto her belly\nwhile she read, feeling tears well up in her eyes. She\u2019d always assumed that\npregnancy was something that she\u2019d never get to experience and for the last few\nyears, she\u2019d found herself jealous of every pregnant woman \u2019d known. These\ntears that were now falling freely from her eyes, weren\u2019t tears of sadness,\nthey were tears of joy. This little boy was everything that she\u2019d ever wanted,\nthe way he came into existence was far from how she\u2019d imagined it, but he was\ngoing to be the most loved little prince on the planet, even without a real\ndad, he was going to have Harry and Poppy couldn\u2019t be more grateful to have him\nas her best friend.</p><p>A knock on\nthe door brought her out of her trance and she stepped down off the bar stool\nand answered the door, wiping the tears from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHiya\u201d\nHarry smiled holding up a bag of groceries</p><p>\u201cHiya!\nHow\u2019d your rehearsals go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were\ngood\u201d he looked at her \u201chave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nPoppy laughed \u201cThe baby\u2019s the size of a cumquat and I got a little emotional\nwhen I found out it has finger nails\u201d</p><p>He chuckled\nat her, taking the bag of groceries to her counter and pulling out two tubs of\nben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream \u201cI got us some pudding\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\ncalled dessert\u201d she corrected him and rolled his eyes</p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou want to call it, it\u2019s still ice-cream\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood\npoint\u201d she said picking up the tub of cookie dough ice cream</p><p>\u201cSo, you\nsaid you had news?\u201d \u00a0he asked, shovelling his spoon into the tub of\nice-cream and bringing it to his lips</p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u201d\nshe said remembering that Harry didn\u2019t know the sex of the baby yet \u201cOpen the\nbox\u201d she pointed to the small yellow box on the counter. He looked at her\nquizzically, and took the lid off the box revealing a blue pacifier</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\ndummy?\u201d he asked a little confused by the gesture</p><p>\u201cWhat\ncolour is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBlue?\u201d he\nasked, voice a little higher than usual. She waited a second before responding,\nhoping that he\u2019d piece it together himself, watching his face as he tried to\nwork it out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy\nHarry\u201d she said bluntly, losing patience with him</p><p>\u201cOhhhhhh\u201d\nhe said, smiling \u201cYou\u2019re having a boy\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\nwant to get something big because it\u2019s still early, but I wanted to get\nsomething to tell you with\u201d she said, pointing at the dummy</p><p>\u201cIt would\nhave been better if I wasn\u2019t so thick\u201d he laughed, placing a hand on her belly\n\u201cThat\u2019s my God Son in there\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nyour God Son H\u201d she said, tears forming in her eyes</p><p>\u201cHeyy\u201d he\nsaid wiping the tears from her eyes \u201cNone o\u2019 that\u201d he picked the dummy out of\nit\u2019s box and handed it to Poppy \u201cI think you might need this more than he does\nright now\u201d</p><p>She\nlaughed, taking the dummy from his hand \u201cI hate you\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you\ndon\u2019t\u201d he smiled, flashing his dimple at her </p><p>****</p><p>How are we liking it so far? For the most part the last few chapters have been almost the same as the original, but after this one things are going to change slightly, which means there will be bigger gaps between updates so that I can get a chance to write it properly and juggle uni, work and life in general. I hope you understand. That being said, I\u2019ve been thinking about creating a pinterest board to share with you guys about the series, I have a personal one already but I was thinking of making a public one and posting to it more often, kinda like the instagrams I\u2019ve been making but a little less time consuming.<a href=\"http://all-the-love-harold.tumblr.com/ask\"> Let me know what you think!\u00a0</a></p>",

Poppy leant her head against\nHarry\u2019s shoulder and waited for her name to be called.</p><p>\u201cMiss\nThomas\u201d a friendly looking nurse called herr name ten minutes later and both\nPoppy and Harry stood making their way over to her \u201cI\u2019m sorry Sir\u201d she said\nlooking at Harry \u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay out here, there\u2019s just not enough room in\nthere\u201d Poppy gave him a worried look and he smiled reassuringly, squeezing her\nhand</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be\nright out here the whole-time love\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep\nyou posted\u201d the nurse smiled at him and lead Poppy into consultation room</p><p>\u201cOk Lovey,\nso I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re experiencing some bleeding, how far along are you?\u201d\nshe gestured towards the chair, inviting her to sit down</p><p>\u201cAlmost 10\nweeks\u201d</p><p>She nodded,\ntaking a look at her notes \u201cright, well it is quite normal to experience light\nbleeding in these early stages of pregnancy, so I don\u2019t want you to worry\nyourself, but since your condition makes you high risk, we\u2019ll do a quick scan\ntoday and make sure everything\u2019s ok\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nPoppy nodded</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome lovey, come through this way with me and we\u2019ll go and find a free\nultrasound machine\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nfollowed her down the long hallway as she popped her head in a few doors before\nfinally turning the lights on in one room and ushered Poppy inside.</p><p>\u201cBingo!\u201d\nshe laughed, trying to lighten the mood \u201calright, you lie down on that bed\nthere, and get comfortable, and I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes with Tony our\nradiographer\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d\nPoppy smiled, and true to her word, a few minutes later she walked back in with\na scrawny man, who would have been in his mid-fifties with a beard that kind of\nreminded Poppy of her dads.</p><p>\u201cMiss\nThomas\u201d he held his hand out and shook hers \u201cI\u2019m Tony, we\u2019re going to check\nthat little bub in there is doing alright\u201d he sat down on the stool that sat\nnext to the machine and searched for the bottle of gel \u201cHave you had a scan\nyet?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had\ntwo\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo!\nAlready!\u201d he laughed \u201cwell you know the drill then\u201d he smiled \u201cI\u2019ll try and get\nan image externally, but this early on it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s going on so we\nmight have to have a little look inside\u201d he shook the bottle of gel and lifted\nbottom of her shirt \u201cthis might be a little cold\u201d</p><p>He squeezed\nthe gel onto her stomach and used the probe to move it around a little before\nturning the machine on. Poppy closed her eyes, because she knew that looking at\nthe screen would freak her out and waited for the sound of the heartbeat, but\nit never came.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s\nlooking good Miss Thomas\u201d Tony said and she opened her eyes</p><p>\u201cBut the\nheartbeat?\u201d she questioned shyly</p><p>He smiled\n\u201cit can be a little hard to hear this early on externally, but if you have a\nlook at the screen here, you can see it\u2019s little heart beating\u201d she moved her\nhead to have a look at the screen and saw the slight flashing where Tony was pointing,\nand a big smile spread across her face. She\u2019d never been so happy to see a tiny\nflashing blob in her life, tears filled her eyes and she let out a little laugh\nat how silly she felt for crying.</p><p>After\ncleaning the gel off her belly and helping her sit up Tony walked out of the\nroom and left her with her nurse.</p><p>\u201cAlright\nMiss Thomas, so now that we all know you\u2019re not having a miscarriage you can\nrelax a little, but we\u2019d still like to know what\u2019s causing the bleeding so I\u2019m\ngoing to page our on call obstetrician to have a look at these and we\u2019ll go\nfrom there\u201d she smiled at her \u201cI\u2019ll take you back out to the waiting room and\nyou can tell Dad the good news, he was white as a ghost when I came out to get\nyou\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she\nlaughed \u201che gets worried easily.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to correct her when she\ncalled Harry the baby\u2019s Dad, he was the closest thing that this baby had to a\nfather and she knew he didn\u2019t care if people thought it was his.</p><p>The nurse\nwalked her back out to the waiting room, where Harry was still sitting in the\ncorner, staring intensely at his phone. He heard the doors open and saw Poppy\nwalk out, standing up and making his way quickly towards her, a worried\nexpression on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEverything\nok?\u201d he asked, panic evident in his voice</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a\nlittle trooper in there H\u201d she said walking back to the chair in the corner and\npatting the seat next to her, telling Harry to come and sit down again. </p><p>\u201cSo\neverything\u2019s ok?\u201d he said softly, aware that everyone was listening to them,\nand taking his seat next to Poppy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\nhaving a miscarriage\u201d she whispered back \u201cbut they don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bleeding,\nso we have to wait for the obstetrician to have a look at my scan\u201d</p><p>He nodded\nand grabbed her hand \u201cI told you everything would be okay, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She giggled\n\u201cYou did, I\u2019m sorry for being a bitch to you in the car, I know you were trying\nto help\u201d She leant her head on his shoulder and put her hand on her belly</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok\nlove, I didn\u2019t take it to heart\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nshe closed her eyes for a brief second, glad that Harry was around when she\nstarted bleeding, knowing that without him to force her out the door she would\nhave turned completely numb. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay H, I know you had things\nto do tonight\u201d with his tour coming up, he rarely had a free night, with\nrehearsals and meetings to make sure that everything was perfect from the very\nfirst show, so she felt guilty for making him sit here with her when everything\nwas fine.</p><p> \u201cI already called everyone and cancelled\ntonight\u2019s rehearsal, you can\u2019t get rid of me that easily love\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank You\u201d\nshe smiled at him \u201cDon\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d He smiled back, rubbing\nhis thumb against her forearm in a comforting manner.</p><p>The wait\nthis time wasn\u2019t short, they saw a few patients come in and out while they sat\npatiently reading through magazines that sat on the coffee table. \u00a0It was\ngetting late and Poppy had had a busy day at work, filled with meetings and\nconference calls trying to make the schedule for the Live Lounge Month work for\nas many people as possible. Herr eyes were getting heavy and she leant her head\non Harry\u2019s shoulder trying her best to stay awake.</p><p>\u201cClose your\neyes love\u201d he whispered \u201cI\u2019ll wake you up when they call your name\u201d. She gave\nin as Harry began stroking her hair, letting herself drift off to sleep right\nthere on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\u201d she\nheard Harry whisper into her ear what felt like minutes later \u201cPoppy, the\ndoctor\u2019s ready to see you now\u201d she blinked a few times adjusting to the harsh\nlighting of the A&amp;E waiting room and lifted her head seeing the\nobstetrician standing next to the doors to the consulting room. She looked at\nher phone as she stood up and made her way over to the doctor, and saw that it\nwas 10:30pm now and she\u2019d been asleep for two hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr\nMarshall\u201d he said with his arm outstretched \u201cSorry about the wait, I had a few\nlabouring mothers\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok\u201d\nshe smiled</p><p>\u201cDad can\ncome in too this time\u201d he pointed at Harry who was looking at something on his\nphone</p><p>Poppy\nsmiled and turned around, looking at Harry trying to gain his attention without\ncalling his name across the room filled with people who might recognise him.\n\u201cH\u201d she said loud enough for him to hear her but not so loud that the entire\nroom would hear as well. He looked up and saw her calling him over and immediately\nstood up from his seat, putting his phone in his back pocket and making his way\nover to her. He took her hand and they both followed the doctor into the\nconsulting room where he invited them both to take a seat.</p><p>\u201cNow\u201d he\nsaid, taking a seat himself \u201cI took a look at your scan and reviewed your\nprevious bloodwork and you\u2019ve got absolutely nothing to worry about\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\nrelief\u201d Harry said</p><p>\u201cIt looks\nlike your bleeding is simply a result of your heart shaped uterus, the right\nside, where the baby isn\u2019t sitting, appears to be shedding some of it\u2019s lining,\nwhich is normal, but we don\u2019t want to happen to the other side, so I\u2019m going to\nprescribe you something to stop the bleeding\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s\nsafe, for the baby?\u201d Poppy asked</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d\nhe nodded, writing something on his prescription pad, and handing it to her\n\u201cI\u2019ll add all this to your notes and make sure that your regular obstetrician\ngets them\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nshe nodded, taking the script from him</p><p>\u201cIt might\ntake a few days for the bleeding to stop, but if it gets any heavier, please\ncome back in\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\nthanks\u201d she said standing up from her chair as he opened the door for them</p><p>\u201cThanks for\nall your help tonight\u201d Harry said shaking his hand as he walked out the door.\nThey both made their way out to Harry\u2019s car joking about how serious Dr\nMarshall had seemed in the few minutes that they\u2019d seen him. The drive home was\nmuch more relaxed and without the busy evening traffic it was much shorter too\nand they\u2019d made it home before Poppy knew it. Harry pulled up right outside her\nbuilding, something he only did when he wasn\u2019t going to be staying long.</p><p>\u201cNot\nstaying tonight H?\u201d she asked, a little disappointed</p><p>\u201cCourse I\nam, just don\u2019t want you walking too far\u201d he smiled at her and stepped out of\nthe range rover jogging over to her side to help her out</p><p>\u201cI can get\nout of the car myself you know\u201d she giggled as he shut the door behind her</p><p>\u201cI know,\nbut you\u2019re fragile tonight\u201d he walked her into the apartment, carrying her\nhandbag for her as she unlocked the door revealing the mess they\u2019d left, \u201cI\u2019ll\nclean up\u201d Harry said looking around at all the dirty dishes left from their\ndinner \u201cyou go and make yourself comfortable\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na shower and washed away the stress of the day, taking herr time and letting\nthe hot water brush over her skin. When she finally finished she put on an old\npair of pyjama shorts and a t-shirt and made her way back into the kitchen,\nfinding that Harry had washed all the dishes and was currently making them both\na cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cFeel\nbetter now?\u201d he asked, pouring the boiling water in the cups</p><p>\u201cA little\u201d\nshe nodded, looking through her bag for the pills the doctor had prescribed for\nher putting one in her mouth and swallowing it. They both sat down to drink the\ntea that Harry had made and talked for a little while longer, before they got\ntoo tired to stay awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nH, I\u2019ve got to go bed\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too\u201d he\nyawned and followed her into the bedroom. The faint sound of Harry breathing\nagainst the pillow lulled Poppy to sleep quickly. Being pregnant was exhausting\nand on top of the day she\u2019d had, she felt like she needed three days of sleep,\nbut tomorrow was another day and she still had a job to get to in the morning.</p><p>***</p><p>Poppy was\nsitting at her desk the next day, a cup of tea next to her laptop and a\nblueberry and cream cheese cronut to go with it. She\u2019d only been at work for a\nfew hours and she\u2019d already had two meetings with Big Boss Ben about who they\nwould be inviting for the live lounge month and how they were going to work out\nthe schedule, he was adamant that all the performances should happen live as\nthey air and she couldn\u2019t seem to convince him of the scheduling nightmare that\nthat would be. He\u2019d asked her to put together a rough draft of a timetable with\nthe artists that had already confirmed their availability and that\u2019s what she\nwas doing when her phone rang. It wasn\u2019t a number that she had saved in her\nphone, and usually she didn\u2019t answer numbers she didn\u2019t know, but considering\nthe events of last night, she picked up, just in case.</p><p>\u201cHello\u201d she\nsaid, into the phone</p><p>\u201cHi is this\nPoppy Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nspeaking\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Miss\nThomas, I\u2019m calling with the results of your harmony test\u201d she\u2019d had the harmony\ntest done a few days after Harry had told her not to worry about the money side\nof things, and she was told that they would call her with the results in a few\nweeks, but if she was honest, after last night, she\u2019d forgotten all about it.</p><p>\u201cOh great\u201d\nshe said cheerfully \u201cis everything ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\npregnancy is low risk for genetic abnormalities\u201d</p><p>A huge wave\nof relief washed over her \u201cthat\u2019s great news\u201d she breathed </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll\nbe welcoming a baby boy into the world\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\nboy!\u201d she exclaimed, a little louder than she meant, causing Ella to turn\naround and look at her, raising her eyebrows</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy\nMiss Thomas, congratulations\u201d</p><p>She cleared\nher throat, trying to choke back the tears \u201cThank you for your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome, good luck with everything\u201d she ended the call and turned back to her\nscheduling nightmare, trying to ignore Ella\u2019s sharp stares. After a few minutes\nof radio silence, she stood up from her chair and walked around to the front of\nPoppy\u2019s desk, kneeling and placing her face in her hands, with elbows resting\non the desk, batting her eyelids like a child that wants something from their\nparents.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\npregnant\u201d she said matter-of-factly, in an angelic tone.</p><p>Poppy\nlooked up from her laptop, trying to hold back a smile \u201cI\u2019m not\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up\nPoppy\u201d she stood up \u201cyou can\u2019t deny it, you\u2019re having a baby\u201d she was walking\nback to her desk and talking very loudly \u201cand it\u2019s a boy\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk fine\u201d\nPoppy whispered, letting herself smile \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, but don\u2019t tell anyone,\nit\u2019s still early\u201d</p><p>If Ella was\nbad at anything it was keeping things a secret, so Poppy didn\u2019t have high hopes\nfor her pregnancy remaining between herself and Harry. Just as she sat down in\nher chair again Grimmy walked out of the hallway, just having finished his show.</p><p>\u201cGrim!\u201d she\nexclaimed \u201cPoppy\u2019s pregnant\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes and watched the expression on his face go from shock to\nexcitement in a matter of seconds \u201cWhat! Now way\u201d he walked over to where she\nwas sitting \u201cCongratulations\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a\nboy\u201d Ella chimed in as Grimmy hugged her</p><p>\u201cElla\u201d\nPoppy said, slightly annoyed \u201cremember when I said not to tell anyone\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nGrimmy, he doesn\u2019t count\u201d she shrugged</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\ntell\u201d he chimed in \u201cpromise\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes at both of them, knowing that Grimmy had a louder mouth than\nElla and by this afternoon the entirety of Radio 1 would know her secret.</p><p>\u201cSo, who\u2019s\nthe baby daddy?\u201d Ella asked</p><p>\u201cOh please,\nit\u2019s Harry\u201d Grimmy said, looking at Poppy, like he knew her entire life story</p><p>\u201cIt is not\nHarry!\u201d she exclaimed, gently pushing him</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s\ndefinitely Harry, you haven\u2019t stopped talking about him this past month\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u201d\nshe rolled her eyes again \u201cYou two can go ahead believing that it\u2019s Harry and\nI\u2019ll get on with my work and keep the details of my wild night to myself\u201d she\nturned back to her laptop and stared at the empty schedule, her mind a little\nblurry with excitement from finding out that the little spud was going to be a\nboy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want\nto know about your wild night with Harry thanks, I already know too much about\nthat kids sex life\u201d Grimmy laughed</p><p>\u201cHey you\nmight not, but I do, dude\u2019s an Adonis\u201d Ella said, shutting Poppy\u2019s laptop\nslightly</p><p>\u201cOh My God\u201d\nshe sighed \u201cDon\u2019t you two have work to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes boss\u201d\nthey both said in unison, Ella turning back to her desk and Grimmy walking back\nto his studio, waving as he left.</p><p>The rest of\nthe day ran smoothly, Poppy was able to get a rough schedule completed and\nconvince Ben that some artists would need to pre-record their performances,\nhanding him a list of the artists that weren\u2019t available during September to\nperform live. By the time 5pm rolled around, she finished writing the\nannouncement for the website and drafted the script for each radio host that\nwould be advertising it. As she was packing up her desk for the day, she sent\nHarry a text, excited to tell him the news.</p><p><i>\u201cYou free\nfor dinner tonight? I\u2019ve got some news\u201d</i></p><p>She was in\nthe lift heading out of the office, when she ran into big boss Ben.</p><p>\u201cI heard a\nlittle rumour today\u201d he said to her pressing the button to go to the ground\nfloor \u201cGrimmy seems to be under the impression that you\u2019re having a baby\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got\nthe right impression\u201d she admitted</p><p>\u201cWell\ncongratulations Poppy\u201d Ben smiled at her \u201cI\u2019m very happy for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d\nshe said smiling as the elevator doors opened \u201cSee you tomorrow\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nclimbed into her car and put her keys into the ignition, hearing her phone buzz\njust before she turned the car on.</p><p><b><i>\u201cMaking up\nfor last night\u2019s missed rehearsal, can\u2019t do dinner, but I\u2019ll make it in time\nfor pudding. Is it good news?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cGreat\nNews. I\u2019ll see you later x\u201d</i></p><p>***</p><p>The kitchen\nwas tidy, and Poppy was seated at her kitchen counter reading her pregnancy\napps after finishing her dinner. According to the app, Little Spud was the size\nof a cumquat, his vital organs were forming and functional and his fingers had\nprobably separated with fingernails starting to form. She held onto her belly\nwhile she read, feeling tears well up in her eyes. She\u2019d always assumed that\npregnancy was something that she\u2019d never get to experience and for the last few\nyears, she\u2019d found herself jealous of every pregnant woman \u2019d known. These\ntears that were now falling freely from her eyes, weren\u2019t tears of sadness,\nthey were tears of joy. This little boy was everything that she\u2019d ever wanted,\nthe way he came into existence was far from how she\u2019d imagined it, but he was\ngoing to be the most loved little prince on the planet, even without a real\ndad, he was going to have Harry and Poppy couldn\u2019t be more grateful to have him\nas her best friend.</p><p>A knock on\nthe door brought her out of her trance and she stepped down off the bar stool\nand answered the door, wiping the tears from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHiya\u201d\nHarry smiled holding up a bag of groceries</p><p>\u201cHiya!\nHow\u2019d your rehearsals go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were\ngood\u201d he looked at her \u201chave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nPoppy laughed \u201cThe baby\u2019s the size of a cumquat and I got a little emotional\nwhen I found out it has finger nails\u201d</p><p>He chuckled\nat her, taking the bag of groceries to her counter and pulling out two tubs of\nben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream \u201cI got us some pudding\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\ncalled dessert\u201d she corrected him and rolled his eyes</p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou want to call it, it\u2019s still ice-cream\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood\npoint\u201d she said picking up the tub of cookie dough ice cream</p><p>\u201cSo, you\nsaid you had news?\u201d \u00a0he asked, shovelling his spoon into the tub of\nice-cream and bringing it to his lips</p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u201d\nshe said remembering that Harry didn\u2019t know the sex of the baby yet \u201cOpen the\nbox\u201d she pointed to the small yellow box on the counter. He looked at her\nquizzically, and took the lid off the box revealing a blue pacifier</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\ndummy?\u201d he asked a little confused by the gesture</p><p>\u201cWhat\ncolour is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBlue?\u201d he\nasked, voice a little higher than usual. She waited a second before responding,\nhoping that he\u2019d piece it together himself, watching his face as he tried to\nwork it out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy\nHarry\u201d she said bluntly, losing patience with him</p><p>\u201cOhhhhhh\u201d\nhe said, smiling \u201cYou\u2019re having a boy\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\nwant to get something big because it\u2019s still early, but I wanted to get\nsomething to tell you with\u201d she said, pointing at the dummy</p><p>\u201cIt would\nhave been better if I wasn\u2019t so thick\u201d he laughed, placing a hand on her belly\n\u201cThat\u2019s my God Son in there\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nyour God Son H\u201d she said, tears forming in her eyes</p><p>\u201cHeyy\u201d he\nsaid wiping the tears from her eyes \u201cNone o\u2019 that\u201d he picked the dummy out of\nit\u2019s box and handed it to Poppy \u201cI think you might need this more than he does\nright now\u201d</p><p>She\nlaughed, taking the dummy from his hand \u201cI hate you\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you\ndon\u2019t\u201d he smiled, flashing his dimple at her </p><p>****</p><p>How are we liking it so far? For the most part the last few chapters have been almost the same as the original, but after this one things are going to change slightly, which means there will be bigger gaps between updates so that I can get a chance to write it properly and juggle uni, work and life in general. I hope you understand. That being said, I\u2019ve been thinking about creating a pinterest board to share with you guys about the series, I have a personal one already but I was thinking of making a public one and posting to it more often, kinda like the instagrams I\u2019ve been making but a little less time consuming.<a href=\"http://all-the-love-harold.tumblr.com/ask\"> Let me know what you think!\u00a0</a></p></p>",

Her whole body was numb, she\ncouldn\u2019t face the idea of losing this baby, but she was positive that that was\nwhat was happening right now. Harry followed her out of the bathroom and in\ninto the kitchen grabbing his car keys and wallet off the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou need to bring love?\u201d he picked her hand bag off it\u2019s hook and held it up to\nher \u201cjust this?\u201d She nodded, unable to form any words, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go\u201d</p><p>She\nfollowed him down stairs to his range rover and he helped her get in on the\npassenger side before running to the driver side and hoping in himself. Neither\nof them said a word the entire drive, letting the radio fill the silence. Poppy\ncould feel her stomach cramping and she was getting more and more worried the\nlonger that they sat in the busy London traffic. Half an hour later, Harry\npulled into the hospital carpark, finding a space close to the entrance of the\nA &amp; E and pulled the keys out of the ignition. He paused for a moment with\nthe keys in his lap, watching as Poppy looked out the window</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s\ngoing to be ok Pop\u201d he leant over and placed a kiss to her cheek \u201cI promise\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make\npromises you can\u2019t keep Harry\u201d she opened the door and got out of the car,\nmaking her way inside while Harry tried to catch up.</p><p>When they\ngot inside they were greeted by a man, who Poppy assumed was a nurse by the way\nhe was dressed \u201cGood afternoon Miss, what\u2019s brought you into A&amp;E today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh, I\u2019m\npregnant, and I\u2019ve had some bleeding tonight\u201d</p><p>He gave her\na sympathetic smile \u201cI\u2019ll page someone from the early pregnancy unit and we\u2019ll\nget you checked out as soon as possible, just take a seat and someone will call\nyou through soon\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nHarry said as they turned and found a seat in the corner away from the old man\nthat was coughing and spluttering everywhere.

Poppy closed her eyes, because she knew that looking at\nthe screen would freak her out and waited for the sound of the heartbeat, but\nit never came.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s\nlooking good Miss Thomas\u201d Tony said and she opened her eyes</p><p>\u201cBut the\nheartbeat?\u201d she questioned shyly</p><p>He smiled\n\u201cit can be a little hard to hear this early on externally, but if you have a\nlook at the screen here, you can see it\u2019s little heart beating\u201d she moved her\nhead to have a look at the screen and saw the slight flashing where Tony was pointing,\nand a big smile spread across her face. She\u2019d never been so happy to see a tiny\nflashing blob in her life, tears filled her eyes and she let out a little laugh\nat how silly she felt for crying.</p><p>After\ncleaning the gel off her belly and helping her sit up Tony walked out of the\nroom and left her with her nurse.</p><p>\u201cAlright\nMiss Thomas, so now that we all know you\u2019re not having a miscarriage you can\nrelax a little, but we\u2019d still like to know what\u2019s causing the bleeding so I\u2019m\ngoing to page our on call obstetrician to have a look at these and we\u2019ll go\nfrom there\u201d she smiled at her \u201cI\u2019ll take you back out to the waiting room and\nyou can tell Dad the good news, he was white as a ghost when I came out to get\nyou\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she\nlaughed \u201che gets worried easily.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to correct her when she\ncalled Harry the baby\u2019s Dad, he was the closest thing that this baby had to a\nfather and she knew he didn\u2019t care if people thought it was his.</p><p>The nurse\nwalked her back out to the waiting room, where Harry was still sitting in the\ncorner, staring intensely at his phone. He heard the doors open and saw Poppy\nwalk out, standing up and making his way quickly towards her, a worried\nexpression on his face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEverything\nok?\u201d he asked, panic evident in his voice</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a\nlittle trooper in there H\u201d she said walking back to the chair in the corner and\npatting the seat next to her, telling Harry to come and sit down again. </p><p>\u201cSo\neverything\u2019s ok?\u201d he said softly, aware that everyone was listening to them,\nand taking his seat next to Poppy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\nhaving a miscarriage\u201d she whispered back \u201cbut they don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bleeding,\nso we have to wait for the obstetrician to have a look at my scan\u201d</p><p>He nodded\nand grabbed her hand \u201cI told you everything would be okay, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She giggled\n\u201cYou did, I\u2019m sorry for being a bitch to you in the car, I know you were trying\nto help\u201d She leant her head on his shoulder and put her hand on her belly</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok\nlove, I didn\u2019t take it to heart\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nshe closed her eyes for a brief second, glad that Harry was around when she\nstarted bleeding, knowing that without him to force her out the door she would\nhave turned completely numb. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay H, I know you had things\nto do tonight\u201d with his tour coming up, he rarely had a free night, with\nrehearsals and meetings to make sure that everything was perfect from the very\nfirst show, so she felt guilty for making him sit here with her when everything\nwas fine.</p><p> \u201cI already called everyone and cancelled\ntonight\u2019s rehearsal, you can\u2019t get rid of me that easily love\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank You\u201d\nshe smiled at him \u201cDon\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d He smiled back, rubbing\nhis thumb against her forearm in a comforting manner.</p><p>The wait\nthis time wasn\u2019t short, they saw a few patients come in and out while they sat\npatiently reading through magazines that sat on the coffee table. \u00a0It was\ngetting late and Poppy had had a busy day at work, filled with meetings and\nconference calls trying to make the schedule for the Live Lounge Month work for\nas many people as possible. Herr eyes were getting heavy and she leant her head\non Harry\u2019s shoulder trying her best to stay awake.</p><p>\u201cClose your\neyes love\u201d he whispered \u201cI\u2019ll wake you up when they call your name\u201d. She gave\nin as Harry began stroking her hair, letting herself drift off to sleep right\nthere on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\u201d she\nheard Harry whisper into her ear what felt like minutes later \u201cPoppy, the\ndoctor\u2019s ready to see you now\u201d she blinked a few times adjusting to the harsh\nlighting of the A&amp;E waiting room and lifted her head seeing the\nobstetrician standing next to the doors to the consulting room. She looked at\nher phone as she stood up and made her way over to the doctor, and saw that it\nwas 10:30pm now and she\u2019d been asleep for two hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr\nMarshall\u201d he said with his arm outstretched \u201cSorry about the wait, I had a few\nlabouring mothers\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok\u201d\nshe smiled</p><p>\u201cDad can\ncome in too this time\u201d he pointed at Harry who was looking at something on his\nphone</p><p>Poppy\nsmiled and turned around, looking at Harry trying to gain his attention without\ncalling his name across the room filled with people who might recognise him.\n\u201cH\u201d she said loud enough for him to hear her but not so loud that the entire\nroom would hear as well. He looked up and saw her calling him over and immediately\nstood up from his seat, putting his phone in his back pocket and making his way\nover to her. He took her hand and they both followed the doctor into the\nconsulting room where he invited them both to take a seat.</p><p>\u201cNow\u201d he\nsaid, taking a seat himself \u201cI took a look at your scan and reviewed your\nprevious bloodwork and you\u2019ve got absolutely nothing to worry about\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a\nrelief\u201d Harry said</p><p>\u201cIt looks\nlike your bleeding is simply a result of your heart shaped uterus, the right\nside, where the baby isn\u2019t sitting, appears to be shedding some of it\u2019s lining,\nwhich is normal, but we don\u2019t want to happen to the other side, so I\u2019m going to\nprescribe you something to stop the bleeding\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s\nsafe, for the baby?\u201d Poppy asked</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d\nhe nodded, writing something on his prescription pad, and handing it to her\n\u201cI\u2019ll add all this to your notes and make sure that your regular obstetrician\ngets them\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d\nshe nodded, taking the script from him</p><p>\u201cIt might\ntake a few days for the bleeding to stop, but if it gets any heavier, please\ncome back in\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\nthanks\u201d she said standing up from her chair as he opened the door for them</p><p>\u201cThanks for\nall your help tonight\u201d Harry said shaking his hand as he walked out the door.\nThey both made their way out to Harry\u2019s car joking about how serious Dr\nMarshall had seemed in the few minutes that they\u2019d seen him. The drive home was\nmuch more relaxed and without the busy evening traffic it was much shorter too\nand they\u2019d made it home before Poppy knew it. Harry pulled up right outside her\nbuilding, something he only did when he wasn\u2019t going to be staying long.</p><p>\u201cNot\nstaying tonight H?\u201d she asked, a little disappointed</p><p>\u201cCourse I\nam, just don\u2019t want you walking too far\u201d he smiled at her and stepped out of\nthe range rover jogging over to her side to help her out</p><p>\u201cI can get\nout of the car myself you know\u201d she giggled as he shut the door behind her</p><p>\u201cI know,\nbut you\u2019re fragile tonight\u201d he walked her into the apartment, carrying her\nhandbag for her as she unlocked the door revealing the mess they\u2019d left, \u201cI\u2019ll\nclean up\u201d Harry said looking around at all the dirty dishes left from their\ndinner \u201cyou go and make yourself comfortable\u201d</p><p>Poppy took\na shower and washed away the stress of the day, taking herr time and letting\nthe hot water brush over her skin. When she finally finished she put on an old\npair of pyjama shorts and a t-shirt and made her way back into the kitchen,\nfinding that Harry had washed all the dishes and was currently making them both\na cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cFeel\nbetter now?\u201d he asked, pouring the boiling water in the cups</p><p>\u201cA little\u201d\nshe nodded, looking through her bag for the pills the doctor had prescribed for\nher putting one in her mouth and swallowing it. They both sat down to drink the\ntea that Harry had made and talked for a little while longer, before they got\ntoo tired to stay awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nH, I\u2019ve got to go bed\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too\u201d he\nyawned and followed her into the bedroom. The faint sound of Harry breathing\nagainst the pillow lulled Poppy to sleep quickly. Being pregnant was exhausting\nand on top of the day she\u2019d had, she felt like she needed three days of sleep,\nbut tomorrow was another day and she still had a job to get to in the morning.</p><p>***</p><p>Poppy was\nsitting at her desk the next day, a cup of tea next to her laptop and a\nblueberry and cream cheese cronut to go with it. She\u2019d only been at work for a\nfew hours and she\u2019d already had two meetings with Big Boss Ben about who they\nwould be inviting for the live lounge month and how they were going to work out\nthe schedule, he was adamant that all the performances should happen live as\nthey air and she couldn\u2019t seem to convince him of the scheduling nightmare that\nthat would be. He\u2019d asked her to put together a rough draft of a timetable with\nthe artists that had already confirmed their availability and that\u2019s what she\nwas doing when her phone rang. It wasn\u2019t a number that she had saved in her\nphone, and usually she didn\u2019t answer numbers she didn\u2019t know, but considering\nthe events of last night, she picked up, just in case.</p><p>\u201cHello\u201d she\nsaid, into the phone</p><p>\u201cHi is this\nPoppy Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nspeaking\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Miss\nThomas, I\u2019m calling with the results of your harmony test\u201d she\u2019d had the harmony\ntest done a few days after Harry had told her not to worry about the money side\nof things, and she was told that they would call her with the results in a few\nweeks, but if she was honest, after last night, she\u2019d forgotten all about it.</p><p>\u201cOh great\u201d\nshe said cheerfully \u201cis everything ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\npregnancy is low risk for genetic abnormalities\u201d</p><p>A huge wave\nof relief washed over her \u201cthat\u2019s great news\u201d she breathed </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll\nbe welcoming a baby boy into the world\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\nboy!\u201d she exclaimed, a little louder than she meant, causing Ella to turn\naround and look at her, raising her eyebrows</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy\nMiss Thomas, congratulations\u201d</p><p>She cleared\nher throat, trying to choke back the tears \u201cThank you for your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome, good luck with everything\u201d she ended the call and turned back to her\nscheduling nightmare, trying to ignore Ella\u2019s sharp stares. After a few minutes\nof radio silence, she stood up from her chair and walked around to the front of\nPoppy\u2019s desk, kneeling and placing her face in her hands, with elbows resting\non the desk, batting her eyelids like a child that wants something from their\nparents.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\npregnant\u201d she said matter-of-factly, in an angelic tone.</p><p>Poppy\nlooked up from her laptop, trying to hold back a smile \u201cI\u2019m not\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up\nPoppy\u201d she stood up \u201cyou can\u2019t deny it, you\u2019re having a baby\u201d she was walking\nback to her desk and talking very loudly \u201cand it\u2019s a boy\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk fine\u201d\nPoppy whispered, letting herself smile \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, but don\u2019t tell anyone,\nit\u2019s still early\u201d</p><p>If Ella was\nbad at anything it was keeping things a secret, so Poppy didn\u2019t have high hopes\nfor her pregnancy remaining between herself and Harry. Just as she sat down in\nher chair again Grimmy walked out of the hallway, just having finished his show.</p><p>\u201cGrim!\u201d she\nexclaimed \u201cPoppy\u2019s pregnant\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes and watched the expression on his face go from shock to\nexcitement in a matter of seconds \u201cWhat! Now way\u201d he walked over to where she\nwas sitting \u201cCongratulations\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a\nboy\u201d Ella chimed in as Grimmy hugged her</p><p>\u201cElla\u201d\nPoppy said, slightly annoyed \u201cremember when I said not to tell anyone\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nGrimmy, he doesn\u2019t count\u201d she shrugged</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\ntell\u201d he chimed in \u201cpromise\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes at both of them, knowing that Grimmy had a louder mouth than\nElla and by this afternoon the entirety of Radio 1 would know her secret.</p><p>\u201cSo, who\u2019s\nthe baby daddy?\u201d Ella asked</p><p>\u201cOh please,\nit\u2019s Harry\u201d Grimmy said, looking at Poppy, like he knew her entire life story</p><p>\u201cIt is not\nHarry!\u201d she exclaimed, gently pushing him</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s\ndefinitely Harry, you haven\u2019t stopped talking about him this past month\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u201d\nshe rolled her eyes again \u201cYou two can go ahead believing that it\u2019s Harry and\nI\u2019ll get on with my work and keep the details of my wild night to myself\u201d she\nturned back to her laptop and stared at the empty schedule, her mind a little\nblurry with excitement from finding out that the little spud was going to be a\nboy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want\nto know about your wild night with Harry thanks, I already know too much about\nthat kids sex life\u201d Grimmy laughed</p><p>\u201cHey you\nmight not, but I do, dude\u2019s an Adonis\u201d Ella said, shutting Poppy\u2019s laptop\nslightly</p><p>\u201cOh My God\u201d\nshe sighed \u201cDon\u2019t you two have work to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes boss\u201d\nthey both said in unison, Ella turning back to her desk and Grimmy walking back\nto his studio, waving as he left.</p><p>The rest of\nthe day ran smoothly, Poppy was able to get a rough schedule completed and\nconvince Ben that some artists would need to pre-record their performances,\nhanding him a list of the artists that weren\u2019t available during September to\nperform live. By the time 5pm rolled around, she finished writing the\nannouncement for the website and drafted the script for each radio host that\nwould be advertising it. As she was packing up her desk for the day, she sent\nHarry a text, excited to tell him the news.</p><p><i>\u201cYou free\nfor dinner tonight? I\u2019ve got some news\u201d</i></p><p>She was in\nthe lift heading out of the office, when she ran into big boss Ben.</p><p>\u201cI heard a\nlittle rumour today\u201d he said to her pressing the button to go to the ground\nfloor \u201cGrimmy seems to be under the impression that you\u2019re having a baby\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got\nthe right impression\u201d she admitted</p><p>\u201cWell\ncongratulations Poppy\u201d Ben smiled at her \u201cI\u2019m very happy for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d\nshe said smiling as the elevator doors opened \u201cSee you tomorrow\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nclimbed into her car and put her keys into the ignition, hearing her phone buzz\njust before she turned the car on.</p><p><b><i>\u201cMaking up\nfor last night\u2019s missed rehearsal, can\u2019t do dinner, but I\u2019ll make it in time\nfor pudding.

I\u2019ll see you later x\u201d</i></p><p>***</p><p>The kitchen\nwas tidy, and Poppy was seated at her kitchen counter reading her pregnancy\napps after finishing her dinner. According to the app, Little Spud was the size\nof a cumquat, his vital organs were forming and functional and his fingers had\nprobably separated with fingernails starting to form. She held onto her belly\nwhile she read, feeling tears well up in her eyes. She\u2019d always assumed that\npregnancy was something that she\u2019d never get to experience and for the last few\nyears, she\u2019d found herself jealous of every pregnant woman \u2019d known. These\ntears that were now falling freely from her eyes, weren\u2019t tears of sadness,\nthey were tears of joy. This little boy was everything that she\u2019d ever wanted,\nthe way he came into existence was far from how she\u2019d imagined it, but he was\ngoing to be the most loved little prince on the planet, even without a real\ndad, he was going to have Harry and Poppy couldn\u2019t be more grateful to have him\nas her best friend.</p><p>A knock on\nthe door brought her out of her trance and she stepped down off the bar stool\nand answered the door, wiping the tears from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHiya\u201d\nHarry smiled holding up a bag of groceries</p><p>\u201cHiya!\nHow\u2019d your rehearsals go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were\ngood\u201d he looked at her \u201chave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nPoppy laughed \u201cThe baby\u2019s the size of a cumquat and I got a little emotional\nwhen I found out it has finger nails\u201d</p><p>He chuckled\nat her, taking the bag of groceries to her counter and pulling out two tubs of\nben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream \u201cI got us some pudding\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\ncalled dessert\u201d she corrected him and rolled his eyes</p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou want to call it, it\u2019s still ice-cream\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood\npoint\u201d she said picking up the tub of cookie dough ice cream</p><p>\u201cSo, you\nsaid you had news?\u201d \u00a0he asked, shovelling his spoon into the tub of\nice-cream and bringing it to his lips</p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u201d\nshe said remembering that Harry didn\u2019t know the sex of the baby yet \u201cOpen the\nbox\u201d she pointed to the small yellow box on the counter. He looked at her\nquizzically, and took the lid off the box revealing a blue pacifier</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\ndummy?\u201d he asked a little confused by the gesture</p><p>\u201cWhat\ncolour is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBlue?\u201d he\nasked, voice a little higher than usual. She waited a second before responding,\nhoping that he\u2019d piece it together himself, watching his face as he tried to\nwork it out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy\nHarry\u201d she said bluntly, losing patience with him</p><p>\u201cOhhhhhh\u201d\nhe said, smiling \u201cYou\u2019re having a boy\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\nwant to get something big because it\u2019s still early, but I wanted to get\nsomething to tell you with\u201d she said, pointing at the dummy</p><p>\u201cIt would\nhave been better if I wasn\u2019t so thick\u201d he laughed, placing a hand on her belly\n\u201cThat\u2019s my God Son in there\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nyour God Son H\u201d she said, tears forming in her eyes</p><p>\u201cHeyy\u201d he\nsaid wiping the tears from her eyes \u201cNone o\u2019 that\u201d he picked the dummy out of\nit\u2019s box and handed it to Poppy \u201cI think you might need this more than he does\nright now\u201d</p><p>She\nlaughed, taking the dummy from his hand \u201cI hate you\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you\ndon\u2019t\u201d he smiled, flashing his dimple at her </p><p>****</p><p>How are we liking it so far? For the most part the last few chapters have been almost the same as the original, but after this one things are going to change slightly, which means there will be bigger gaps between updates so that I can get a chance to write it properly and juggle uni, work and life in general. I hope you understand. That being said, I\u2019ve been thinking about creating a pinterest board to share with you guys about the series, I have a personal one already but I was thinking of making a public one and posting to it more often, kinda like the instagrams I\u2019ve been making but a little less time consuming.<a href=\"http://all-the-love-harold.tumblr.com/ask\"> Let me know what you think!\u00a0</a></p></p>",

Her whole body was numb, she\ncouldn&rsquo;t face the idea of losing this baby, but she was positive that that was\nwhat was happening right now. Harry followed her out of the bathroom and in\ninto the kitchen grabbing his car keys and wallet off the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;What do\nyou need to bring love?&rdquo; he picked her hand bag off it&rsquo;s hook and held it up to\nher &ldquo;just this?&rdquo; She nodded, unable to form any words, &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go&rdquo;</p><p>She\nfollowed him down stairs to his range rover and he helped her get in on the\npassenger side before running to the driver side and hoping in himself. Neither\nof them said a word the entire drive, letting the radio fill the silence. Poppy\ncould feel her stomach cramping and she was getting more and more worried the\nlonger that they sat in the busy London traffic. Half an hour later, Harry\npulled into the hospital carpark, finding a space close to the entrance of the\nA &amp; E and pulled the keys out of the ignition. He paused for a moment with\nthe keys in his lap, watching as Poppy looked out the window</p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s\ngoing to be ok Pop&rdquo; he leant over and placed a kiss to her cheek &ldquo;I promise&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make\npromises you can&rsquo;t keep Harry&rdquo; she opened the door and got out of the car,\nmaking her way inside while Harry tried to catch up.</p><p>When they\ngot inside they were greeted by a man, who Poppy assumed was a nurse by the way\nhe was dressed &ldquo;Good afternoon Miss, what&rsquo;s brought you into A&amp;E today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh, I&rsquo;m\npregnant, and I&rsquo;ve had some bleeding tonight&rdquo;</p><p>He gave her\na sympathetic smile &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll page someone from the early pregnancy unit and we&rsquo;ll\nget you checked out as soon as possible, just take a seat and someone will call\nyou through soon&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;\nHarry said as they turned and found a seat in the corner away from the old man\nthat was coughing and spluttering everywhere. Poppy leant her head against\nHarry&rsquo;s shoulder and waited for her name to be called.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss\nThomas&rdquo; a friendly looking nurse called herr name ten minutes later and both\nPoppy and Harry stood making their way over to her &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Sir&rdquo; she said\nlooking at Harry &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to stay out here, there&rsquo;s just not enough room in\nthere&rdquo; Poppy gave him a worried look and he smiled reassuringly, squeezing her\nhand</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be\nright out here the whole-time love&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep\nyou posted&rdquo; the nurse smiled at him and lead Poppy into consultation room</p><p>&ldquo;Ok Lovey,\nso I&rsquo;ve been told you&rsquo;re experiencing some bleeding, how far along are you?&rdquo;\nshe gestured towards the chair, inviting her to sit down</p><p>&ldquo;Almost 10\nweeks&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded,\ntaking a look at her notes &ldquo;right, well it is quite normal to experience light\nbleeding in these early stages of pregnancy, so I don&rsquo;t want you to worry\nyourself, but since your condition makes you high risk, we&rsquo;ll do a quick scan\ntoday and make sure everything&rsquo;s ok&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;\nPoppy nodded</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nwelcome lovey, come through this way with me and we&rsquo;ll go and find a free\nultrasound machine&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\nfollowed her down the long hallway as she popped her head in a few doors before\nfinally turning the lights on in one room and ushered Poppy inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Bingo!&rdquo;\nshe laughed, trying to lighten the mood &ldquo;alright, you lie down on that bed\nthere, and get comfortable, and I&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes with Tony our\nradiographer&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo;\nPoppy smiled, and true to her word, a few minutes later she walked back in with\na scrawny man, who would have been in his mid-fifties with a beard that kind of\nreminded Poppy of her dads.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss\nThomas&rdquo; he held his hand out and shook hers &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tony, we&rsquo;re going to check\nthat little bub in there is doing alright&rdquo; he sat down on the stool that sat\nnext to the machine and searched for the bottle of gel &ldquo;Have you had a scan\nyet?&rdquo; he asked </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had\ntwo&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two!\nAlready!&rdquo; he laughed &ldquo;well you know the drill then&rdquo; he smiled &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and get\nan image externally, but this early on it&rsquo;s hard to see what&rsquo;s going on so we\nmight have to have a little look inside&rdquo; he shook the bottle of gel and lifted\nbottom of her shirt &ldquo;this might be a little cold&rdquo;</p><p>He squeezed\nthe gel onto her stomach and used the probe to move it around a little before\nturning the machine on. Poppy closed her eyes, because she knew that looking at\nthe screen would freak her out and waited for the sound of the heartbeat, but\nit never came.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s\nlooking good Miss Thomas&rdquo; Tony said and she opened her eyes</p><p>&ldquo;But the\nheartbeat?&rdquo; she questioned shyly</p><p>He smiled\n&ldquo;it can be a little hard to hear this early on externally, but if you have a\nlook at the screen here, you can see it&rsquo;s little heart beating&rdquo; she moved her\nhead to have a look at the screen and saw the slight flashing where Tony was pointing,\nand a big smile spread across her face. She&rsquo;d never been so happy to see a tiny\nflashing blob in her life, tears filled her eyes and she let out a little laugh\nat how silly she felt for crying.</p><p>After\ncleaning the gel off her belly and helping her sit up Tony walked out of the\nroom and left her with her nurse.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright\nMiss Thomas, so now that we all know you&rsquo;re not having a miscarriage you can\nrelax a little, but we&rsquo;d still like to know what&rsquo;s causing the bleeding so I&rsquo;m\ngoing to page our on call obstetrician to have a look at these and we&rsquo;ll go\nfrom there&rdquo; she smiled at her &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you back out to the waiting room and\nyou can tell Dad the good news, he was white as a ghost when I came out to get\nyou&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; she\nlaughed &ldquo;he gets worried easily.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t bother to correct her when she\ncalled Harry the baby&rsquo;s Dad, he was the closest thing that this baby had to a\nfather and she knew he didn&rsquo;t care if people thought it was his.</p><p>The nurse\nwalked her back out to the waiting room, where Harry was still sitting in the\ncorner, staring intensely at his phone. He heard the doors open and saw Poppy\nwalk out, standing up and making his way quickly towards her, a worried\nexpression on his face. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything\nok?&rdquo; he asked, panic evident in his voice</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a\nlittle trooper in there H&rdquo; she said walking back to the chair in the corner and\npatting the seat next to her, telling Harry to come and sit down again. </p><p>&ldquo;So\neverything&rsquo;s ok?&rdquo; he said softly, aware that everyone was listening to them,\nand taking his seat next to Poppy.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not\nhaving a miscarriage&rdquo; she whispered back &ldquo;but they don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m bleeding,\nso we have to wait for the obstetrician to have a look at my scan&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded\nand grabbed her hand &ldquo;I told you everything would be okay, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>She giggled\n&ldquo;You did, I&rsquo;m sorry for being a bitch to you in the car, I know you were trying\nto help&rdquo; She leant her head on his shoulder and put her hand on her belly</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok\nlove, I didn&rsquo;t take it to heart&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;\nshe closed her eyes for a brief second, glad that Harry was around when she\nstarted bleeding, knowing that without him to force her out the door she would\nhave turned completely numb. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stay H, I know you had things\nto do tonight&rdquo; with his tour coming up, he rarely had a free night, with\nrehearsals and meetings to make sure that everything was perfect from the very\nfirst show, so she felt guilty for making him sit here with her when everything\nwas fine.</p><p> &ldquo;I already called everyone and cancelled\ntonight&rsquo;s rehearsal, you can&rsquo;t get rid of me that easily love&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;\nshe smiled at him &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do without you.&rdquo; He smiled back, rubbing\nhis thumb against her forearm in a comforting manner.</p><p>The wait\nthis time wasn&rsquo;t short, they saw a few patients come in and out while they sat\npatiently reading through magazines that sat on the coffee table. &nbsp;It was\ngetting late and Poppy had had a busy day at work, filled with meetings and\nconference calls trying to make the schedule for the Live Lounge Month work for\nas many people as possible. Herr eyes were getting heavy and she leant her head\non Harry&rsquo;s shoulder trying her best to stay awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Close your\neyes love&rdquo; he whispered &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wake you up when they call your name&rdquo;. She gave\nin as Harry began stroking her hair, letting herself drift off to sleep right\nthere on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Poppy&rdquo; she\nheard Harry whisper into her ear what felt like minutes later &ldquo;Poppy, the\ndoctor&rsquo;s ready to see you now&rdquo; she blinked a few times adjusting to the harsh\nlighting of the A&amp;E waiting room and lifted her head seeing the\nobstetrician standing next to the doors to the consulting room. She looked at\nher phone as she stood up and made her way over to the doctor, and saw that it\nwas 10:30pm now and she&rsquo;d been asleep for two hours.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dr\nMarshall&rdquo; he said with his arm outstretched &ldquo;Sorry about the wait, I had a few\nlabouring mothers&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ok&rdquo;\nshe smiled</p><p>&ldquo;Dad can\ncome in too this time&rdquo; he pointed at Harry who was looking at something on his\nphone</p><p>Poppy\nsmiled and turned around, looking at Harry trying to gain his attention without\ncalling his name across the room filled with people who might recognise him.\n&ldquo;H&rdquo; she said loud enough for him to hear her but not so loud that the entire\nroom would hear as well. He looked up and saw her calling him over and immediately\nstood up from his seat, putting his phone in his back pocket and making his way\nover to her. He took her hand and they both followed the doctor into the\nconsulting room where he invited them both to take a seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Now&rdquo; he\nsaid, taking a seat himself &ldquo;I took a look at your scan and reviewed your\nprevious bloodwork and you&rsquo;ve got absolutely nothing to worry about&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a\nrelief&rdquo; Harry said</p><p>&ldquo;It looks\nlike your bleeding is simply a result of your heart shaped uterus, the right\nside, where the baby isn&rsquo;t sitting, appears to be shedding some of it&rsquo;s lining,\nwhich is normal, but we don&rsquo;t want to happen to the other side, so I&rsquo;m going to\nprescribe you something to stop the bleeding&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s\nsafe, for the baby?&rdquo; Poppy asked</p><p>&ldquo;Of course&rdquo;\nhe nodded, writing something on his prescription pad, and handing it to her\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll add all this to your notes and make sure that your regular obstetrician\ngets them&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;\nshe nodded, taking the script from him</p><p>&ldquo;It might\ntake a few days for the bleeding to stop, but if it gets any heavier, please\ncome back in&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,\nthanks&rdquo; she said standing up from her chair as he opened the door for them</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for\nall your help tonight&rdquo; Harry said shaking his hand as he walked out the door.\nThey both made their way out to Harry&rsquo;s car joking about how serious Dr\nMarshall had seemed in the few minutes that they&rsquo;d seen him. The drive home was\nmuch more relaxed and without the busy evening traffic it was much shorter too\nand they&rsquo;d made it home before Poppy knew it. Harry pulled up right outside her\nbuilding, something he only did when he wasn&rsquo;t going to be staying long.</p><p>&ldquo;Not\nstaying tonight H?&rdquo; she asked, a little disappointed</p><p>&ldquo;Course I\nam, just don&rsquo;t want you walking too far&rdquo; he smiled at her and stepped out of\nthe range rover jogging over to her side to help her out</p><p>&ldquo;I can get\nout of the car myself you know&rdquo; she giggled as he shut the door behind her</p><p>&ldquo;I know,\nbut you&rsquo;re fragile tonight&rdquo; he walked her into the apartment, carrying her\nhandbag for her as she unlocked the door revealing the mess they&rsquo;d left, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nclean up&rdquo; Harry said looking around at all the dirty dishes left from their\ndinner &ldquo;you go and make yourself comfortable&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy took\na shower and washed away the stress of the day, taking herr time and letting\nthe hot water brush over her skin. When she finally finished she put on an old\npair of pyjama shorts and a t-shirt and made her way back into the kitchen,\nfinding that Harry had washed all the dishes and was currently making them both\na cup of tea.</p><p>&ldquo;Feel\nbetter now?&rdquo; he asked, pouring the boiling water in the cups</p><p>&ldquo;A little&rdquo;\nshe nodded, looking through her bag for the pills the doctor had prescribed for\nher putting one in her mouth and swallowing it. They both sat down to drink the\ntea that Harry had made and talked for a little while longer, before they got\ntoo tired to stay awake.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry\nH, I&rsquo;ve got to go bed&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too&rdquo; he\nyawned and followed her into the bedroom. The faint sound of Harry breathing\nagainst the pillow lulled Poppy to sleep quickly. Being pregnant was exhausting\nand on top of the day she&rsquo;d had, she felt like she needed three days of sleep,\nbut tomorrow was another day and she still had a job to get to in the morning.</p><p>***</p><p>Poppy was\nsitting at her desk the next day, a cup of tea next to her laptop and a\nblueberry and cream cheese cronut to go with it. She&rsquo;d only been at work for a\nfew hours and she&rsquo;d already had two meetings with Big Boss Ben about who they\nwould be inviting for the live lounge month and how they were going to work out\nthe schedule, he was adamant that all the performances should happen live as\nthey air and she couldn&rsquo;t seem to convince him of the scheduling nightmare that\nthat would be. He&rsquo;d asked her to put together a rough draft of a timetable with\nthe artists that had already confirmed their availability and that&rsquo;s what she\nwas doing when her phone rang. It wasn&rsquo;t a number that she had saved in her\nphone, and usually she didn&rsquo;t answer numbers she didn&rsquo;t know, but considering\nthe events of last night, she picked up, just in case.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; she\nsaid, into the phone</p><p>&ldquo;Hi is this\nPoppy Thomas?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nspeaking&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Miss\nThomas, I&rsquo;m calling with the results of your harmony test&rdquo; she&rsquo;d had the harmony\ntest done a few days after Harry had told her not to worry about the money side\nof things, and she was told that they would call her with the results in a few\nweeks, but if she was honest, after last night, she&rsquo;d forgotten all about it.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh great&rdquo;\nshe said cheerfully &ldquo;is everything ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your\npregnancy is low risk for genetic abnormalities&rdquo;</p><p>A huge wave\nof relief washed over her &ldquo;that&rsquo;s great news&rdquo; she breathed </p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll\nbe welcoming a baby boy into the world&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a\nboy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, a little louder than she meant, causing Ella to turn\naround and look at her, raising her eyebrows</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy\nMiss Thomas, congratulations&rdquo;</p><p>She cleared\nher throat, trying to choke back the tears &ldquo;Thank you for your call.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nwelcome, good luck with everything&rdquo; she ended the call and turned back to her\nscheduling nightmare, trying to ignore Ella&rsquo;s sharp stares. After a few minutes\nof radio silence, she stood up from her chair and walked around to the front of\nPoppy&rsquo;s desk, kneeling and placing her face in her hands, with elbows resting\non the desk, batting her eyelids like a child that wants something from their\nparents.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\npregnant&rdquo; she said matter-of-factly, in an angelic tone.</p><p>Poppy\nlooked up from her laptop, trying to hold back a smile &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up\nPoppy&rdquo; she stood up &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t deny it, you&rsquo;re having a baby&rdquo; she was walking\nback to her desk and talking very loudly &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a boy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok fine&rdquo;\nPoppy whispered, letting herself smile &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant, but don&rsquo;t tell anyone,\nit&rsquo;s still early&rdquo;</p><p>If Ella was\nbad at anything it was keeping things a secret, so Poppy didn&rsquo;t have high hopes\nfor her pregnancy remaining between herself and Harry. Just as she sat down in\nher chair again Grimmy walked out of the hallway, just having finished his show.</p><p>&ldquo;Grim!&rdquo; she\nexclaimed &ldquo;Poppy&rsquo;s pregnant&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes and watched the expression on his face go from shock to\nexcitement in a matter of seconds &ldquo;What! Now way&rdquo; he walked over to where she\nwas sitting &ldquo;Congratulations&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a\nboy&rdquo; Ella chimed in as Grimmy hugged her</p><p>&ldquo;Ella&rdquo;\nPoppy said, slightly annoyed &ldquo;remember when I said not to tell anyone&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nGrimmy, he doesn&rsquo;t count&rdquo; she shrugged</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t\ntell&rdquo; he chimed in &ldquo;promise&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\nrolled her eyes at both of them, knowing that Grimmy had a louder mouth than\nElla and by this afternoon the entirety of Radio 1 would know her secret.</p><p>&ldquo;So, who&rsquo;s\nthe baby daddy?&rdquo; Ella asked</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please,\nit&rsquo;s Harry&rdquo; Grimmy said, looking at Poppy, like he knew her entire life story</p><p>&ldquo;It is not\nHarry!&rdquo; she exclaimed, gently pushing him</p><p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s\ndefinitely Harry, you haven&rsquo;t stopped talking about him this past month&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever&rdquo;\nshe rolled her eyes again &ldquo;You two can go ahead believing that it&rsquo;s Harry and\nI&rsquo;ll get on with my work and keep the details of my wild night to myself&rdquo; she\nturned back to her laptop and stared at the empty schedule, her mind a little\nblurry with excitement from finding out that the little spud was going to be a\nboy.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want\nto know about your wild night with Harry thanks, I already know too much about\nthat kids sex life&rdquo; Grimmy laughed</p><p>&ldquo;Hey you\nmight not, but I do, dude&rsquo;s an Adonis&rdquo; Ella said, shutting Poppy&rsquo;s laptop\nslightly</p><p>&ldquo;Oh My God&rdquo;\nshe sighed &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you two have work to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes boss&rdquo;\nthey both said in unison, Ella turning back to her desk and Grimmy walking back\nto his studio, waving as he left.</p><p>The rest of\nthe day ran smoothly, Poppy was able to get a rough schedule completed and\nconvince Ben that some artists would need to pre-record their performances,\nhanding him a list of the artists that weren&rsquo;t available during September to\nperform live. By the time 5pm rolled around, she finished writing the\nannouncement for the website and drafted the script for each radio host that\nwould be advertising it. As she was packing up her desk for the day, she sent\nHarry a text, excited to tell him the news.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You free\nfor dinner tonight? I&rsquo;ve got some news&rdquo;</i></p><p>She was in\nthe lift heading out of the office, when she ran into big boss Ben.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard a\nlittle rumour today&rdquo; he said to her pressing the button to go to the ground\nfloor &ldquo;Grimmy seems to be under the impression that you&rsquo;re having a baby&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got\nthe right impression&rdquo; she admitted</p><p>&ldquo;Well\ncongratulations Poppy&rdquo; Ben smiled at her &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy for you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;\nshe said smiling as the elevator doors opened &ldquo;See you tomorrow&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\nclimbed into her car and put her keys into the ignition, hearing her phone buzz\njust before she turned the car on.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Making up\nfor last night&rsquo;s missed rehearsal, can&rsquo;t do dinner, but I&rsquo;ll make it in time\nfor pudding. Is it good news?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Great\nNews. I&rsquo;ll see you later x&rdquo;</i></p><p>***</p><p>The kitchen\nwas tidy, and Poppy was seated at her kitchen counter reading her pregnancy\napps after finishing her dinner. According to the app, Little Spud was the size\nof a cumquat, his vital organs were forming and functional and his fingers had\nprobably separated with fingernails starting to form. She held onto her belly\nwhile she read, feeling tears well up in her eyes. She&rsquo;d always assumed that\npregnancy was something that she&rsquo;d never get to experience and for the last few\nyears, she&rsquo;d found herself jealous of every pregnant woman &rsquo;d known. These\ntears that were now falling freely from her eyes, weren&rsquo;t tears of sadness,\nthey were tears of joy. This little boy was everything that she&rsquo;d ever wanted,\nthe way he came into existence was far from how she&rsquo;d imagined it, but he was\ngoing to be the most loved little prince on the planet, even without a real\ndad, he was going to have Harry and Poppy couldn&rsquo;t be more grateful to have him\nas her best friend.</p><p>A knock on\nthe door brought her out of her trance and she stepped down off the bar stool\nand answered the door, wiping the tears from her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Hiya&rdquo;\nHarry smiled holding up a bag of groceries</p><p>&ldquo;Hiya!\nHow&rsquo;d your rehearsals go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They were\ngood&rdquo; he looked at her &ldquo;have you been crying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nPoppy laughed &ldquo;The baby&rsquo;s the size of a cumquat and I got a little emotional\nwhen I found out it has finger nails&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled\nat her, taking the bag of groceries to her counter and pulling out two tubs of\nben and Jerry&rsquo;s ice cream &ldquo;I got us some pudding&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ncalled dessert&rdquo; she corrected him and rolled his eyes</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever\nyou want to call it, it&rsquo;s still ice-cream&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good\npoint&rdquo; she said picking up the tub of cookie dough ice cream</p><p>&ldquo;So, you\nsaid you had news?&rdquo; &nbsp;he asked, shovelling his spoon into the tub of\nice-cream and bringing it to his lips</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah&rdquo;\nshe said remembering that Harry didn&rsquo;t know the sex of the baby yet &ldquo;Open the\nbox&rdquo; she pointed to the small yellow box on the counter. He looked at her\nquizzically, and took the lid off the box revealing a blue pacifier</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a\ndummy?&rdquo; he asked a little confused by the gesture</p><p>&ldquo;What\ncolour is it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Blue?&rdquo; he\nasked, voice a little higher than usual. She waited a second before responding,\nhoping that he&rsquo;d piece it together himself, watching his face as he tried to\nwork it out.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy\nHarry&rdquo; she said bluntly, losing patience with him</p><p>&ldquo;Ohhhhhh&rdquo;\nhe said, smiling &ldquo;You&rsquo;re having a boy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t\nwant to get something big because it&rsquo;s still early, but I wanted to get\nsomething to tell you with&rdquo; she said, pointing at the dummy</p><p>&ldquo;It would\nhave been better if I wasn&rsquo;t so thick&rdquo; he laughed, placing a hand on her belly\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my God Son in there&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nyour God Son H&rdquo; she said, tears forming in her eyes</p><p>&ldquo;Heyy&rdquo; he\nsaid wiping the tears from her eyes &ldquo;None o&rsquo; that&rdquo; he picked the dummy out of\nit&rsquo;s box and handed it to Poppy &ldquo;I think you might need this more than he does\nright now&rdquo;</p><p>She\nlaughed, taking the dummy from his hand &ldquo;I hate you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you\ndon&rsquo;t&rdquo; he smiled, flashing his dimple at her </p><p>****</p><p>How are we liking it so far? For the most part the last few chapters have been almost the same as the original, but after this one things are going to change slightly, which means there will be bigger gaps between updates so that I can get a chance to write it properly and juggle uni, work and life in general. I hope you understand. That being said, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about creating a pinterest board to share with you guys about the series, I have a personal one already but I was thinking of making a public one and posting to it more often, kinda like the instagrams I&rsquo;ve been making but a little less time consuming.<a href=\"http://all-the-love-harold.tumblr.com/ask\"> Let me know what you think!&nbsp;</a></p></p>",

Her whole body was numb, she\ncouldn&rsquo;t face the idea of losing this baby, but she was positive that that was\nwhat was happening right now. Harry followed her out of the bathroom and in\ninto the kitchen grabbing his car keys and wallet off the counter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What do\nyou need to bring love?&rdquo; he picked her hand bag off it&rsquo;s hook and held it up to\nher &ldquo;just this?&rdquo; She nodded, unable to form any words, &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She\nfollowed him down stairs to his range rover and he helped her get in on the\npassenger side before running to the driver side and hoping in himself. Neither\nof them said a word the entire drive, letting the radio fill the silence. Poppy\ncould feel her stomach cramping and she was getting more and more worried the\nlonger that they sat in the busy London traffic. Half an hour later, Harry\npulled into the hospital carpark, finding a space close to the entrance of the\nA &amp; E and pulled the keys out of the ignition. He paused for a moment with\nthe keys in his lap, watching as Poppy looked out the window</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s\ngoing to be ok Pop&rdquo; he leant over and placed a kiss to her cheek &ldquo;I promise&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

Maybe if I\u2019m really clever I can strive to get an episode of this out every Sunday? But I\u2019m not that clever so we\u2019ll see&hellip; ANYWAY, have 3.5k+ of angst angst and angst for the first time in this series ever! YAAAAAAY! Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cOo that\u2019s it.\u201d</i></p><p>Fee looks up from her homework on the table at the sound of the voice. Her eyes meet Dillon\u2019s across room. \u201cWas that?\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s eyes widen as he grimaces at all the new thoughts running around his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about that, Fee&hellip;\u201d</p><!-- more --><p><i>\u201cAaaah, yeah right there.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no, <i>no.</i>\u201d Aoife cringes as she gingerly gets out of her seat and creeps towards the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go looking, Fee!\u201d Dillon hisses with near disgust.</p><p><i>\u201cThat feel good, love?\u201d</i> Harry\u2019s voice comes clear as day, and Dillon and Fee both groan in horror at the sound.</p><p>\u201cThey know we\u2019re home, right?\u201d Dillon asks nervously as Fee continues out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d She asks a little incredulously, following the sound of the heavy sigh that sounds like it came from you.</p><p>Dillon shrugs, reluctantly following his sister as she creeps towards the living room. More awkward moans filter out of the living room as they grow closer, and the siblings\u2019 cringes only grow deeper.</p><p>When Fee sticks her head around the door frame she can\u2019t imagine ever being more relieved as Harry sits there scratching your back.</p><p>\u201cMum, are you aware of the absolute racket you\u2019re making?\u201d Dillon interrupts before Fee has a chance.</p><p>Harry cackles, glancing at you who\u2019s frowning with offence. \u201cSo what, your mum enjoys a back scratch every now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s fine, but you sound like you\u2019re&hellip; you know, doing the other thing.\u201d Fee continues to wince over her words.</p><p>\u201cOh, for crying out loud.\u201d You huff and stand straight, scowling at your children. \u201cYou really think we\u2019d just do it in the living room with the pair of you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure we\u2019ve done that before&hellip;\u201d Harry mumbles, smirking to himself as you smack the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Fee scoffs. \u201cHow could people ever stand to be around the pair of you when you were first together if all you did was make out and&hellip; do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t always that easy, baby girl.\u201d You mumble as you pass, giving her cheek a slight pinch.</p><p>Dillon watches after you with a befuddled gaze before looking back to his dad. \u201cWhat did she mean by that..?\u201d</p><p>~</p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s been fucking two days! And I haven\u2019t heard a peep from him!\u201d You scream down the phone, pacing back and forth in your flat.</i></p><p><i>The rage that had been building and bubbling up inside of you had finally spilled over when Jeff decided to answer one of your calls.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBelieve me, if I knew where he was I would tell you. But I don\u2019t.\u201d Jeff mumbles, a little too calmly for your liking.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Jeff. And you know it is.\u201d You spit back, hitting the door with the palm of your hand as you pass in frustration. \u201cI know he\u2019s with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s not here!\u201d Jeff yells suddenly, startling you for only a moment between your stomping footsteps. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering me either, alright?! I don\u2019t know what you did o-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat I did?!\u201d You can\u2019t believe your ears. \u201cI didn\u2019t </i>do<i> anything! He was in my flat that morning when I left for work, happy as Larry, fine and dandy, same as usual. I called him at lunch and he was still fine. And I came back and he was gone, I didn\u2019t do any-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your ranting is interrupted by Jeff practically squealing your name. \u201cI\u2019m not accusing you of anything, for crying out loud! Your relationship is private, I\u2019ve always respected that, you know that!\u201d </i></p><p><i>You know he\u2019s not finished when he pauses so you just wait for him to speak again, settling into the kitchen table with your head in your hand.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSomething must\u2019ve happened for him to just disappear, but when I say that I\u2019m not accusing you. I don\u2019t know what it is but I\u2019m going to try and find out, alright? I\u2019m with you on this one, I know nothing.\u201d Jeff\u2019s tone is much calmer, more collected as he takes a final deep breath.</i></p><p><i>You follow suit, but you\u2019re on the verge of tears still and not sure what to do with yourself. \u201cIf you hear from him can you just&hellip; at least let me know? You don\u2019t have to tell me where he is or anything I just want to know that he\u2019s alright.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course I will, love. He\u2019ll get past it, I\u2019m sure. Just give him time.\u201d He assures you, though it\u2019s not doing much for the sick feeling in your stomach. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the next few days, alright?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You nod, realising he can\u2019t see you and sighing. \u201cYeah, alright. Sorry for being a bitch. And thank you for your help.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jeff chuckles lightly. \u201cNah you\u2019re fine, don\u2019t blame you at all. Keep your head on, might need it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>It might seem ridiculous to have your back up about Harry being awol for two days, but the thing is he\u2019d always tell you where he was going and what he was doing. Since you\u2019d met nearly a year ago you\u2019d spoken every day without fail, no matter where he was, what time zone, what country, you would always keep a moment in your day for one another.</i></p><p><i>People knew you were a thing now, it was in the media a bit, fans knew you existed and he seemed happy. You\u2019d been spotted together a handful of times and it just wasn\u2019t a secret anymore. You saw each other when you could and it seemed to be going really well.</i></p><p><i>Which is why you couldn\u2019t understand why Harry had just fucked off all of a sudden without a word, not even a note. You\u2019d sent him message after message, and his voicemail was no doubt filling up with your needy messages. You\u2019d barely slept, which might sound dramatic but you had no idea where he was. No one had seen him or spoken to him, he\u2019d just vanished.</i></p><p><i>Even though you couldn\u2019t think of anything, you wondered if you had done something wrong, because there was always that possibility. Maybe you\u2019d said something you shouldn\u2019t have, maybe he found something out about you that he didn\u2019t like. But then even if that was the case he\u2019d usually at least try and talk to you about it rather than just run away.</i></p><p><i>None of it made sense to you. He wasn\u2019t even reading your messages, he just appeared to be ignoring you, completely done with you all of a sudden. You hated it. You hated not having him around, not even being able to chat to him. You\u2019d tell him about literally everything, including what you were having to eat each day, because he\u2019d always seem just so interested, regardless of how mundane it actually was. I was like he was fascinated by you, besotted with you for whatever reason, and now he was bored of you and just sacked you off.</i></p><p><i>If that was the case then he definitely wasn\u2019t the man you thought he was.</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>\u201cStill nothing?\u201d Lana asks as she watches you with a worried frown, taking a seat opposite you with two mugs of tea.</i></p><p><i>You shake your head in response. Your eyes and head feel heavy from all the crying and lack of sleep you\u2019ve had. You don\u2019t trust your voice given you\u2019ve barely said three words apart from when you really have to, that made work extra difficult when the phones were ringing non-stop. You\u2019re lucky your colleagues look after you, using the excuse to everyone else that you\u2019ve got the worst cold and have lost your voice. You\u2019ve been snotting enough for it to look like it. There\u2019s a permanent ache in your chest and you feel a little numb.</i></p><p><i>Again, it all might seem like an overreaction, but the man you\u2019re stupidly in love with, the man you wanted to tell how much you loved him because you haven\u2019t actually said the three words in the right order to his face yet, has completely abandoned you. It\u2019s been a week and you\u2019ve still heard nothing, only the odd phone call from Jeff to update you with any progress.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan stay here with me and Dale if you like?\u201d Lana offers, forcing a smile as she takes a hold of your hand.</i></p><p><i>You love your brother but he\u2019s not been the most understanding of your relationship with Harry. Staying with him now would just make Dale\u2019s opinion of him drop further, and that\u2019s the last thing you want when you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened. You shake your head again and clear your throat. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. Think I\u2019d rather stay out the way until I get over it, but thank you for the offer.\u201d Your voice is so weak, barely audible and cracking over nearly every syllable you speak. The last time you ever heard it so weak was when your ex left, and the horrible thing is you feel way worse about Harry leaving than when he did.</i></p><p><i>Lana nods, half expecting the answer anyway. \u201cThe offer is always there if you change your mind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You attempt a smile back, though it\u2019s really not much to go on. You\u2019d always liked Lana, she was good to your brother and sometimes even better to you. You knew your brother planned on proposing any day now, and that was at least something to feel happy about in amongst this new darkness you\u2019ve found yourself accompanied with.</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnne?\u201d You answer your phone to the frankly unexpected caller. It\u2019s been nearly two weeks now, and you\u2019re slowly starting to accept the fact that Harry probably isn\u2019t coming back to you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHiya, love.\u201d She sounds a little deflated. \u201cHe\u2019s just turned up here, I er, thought you\u2019d like to know.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take a deep breath and carefully lower yourself into the sofa as your stomach falls to the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s with you?\u201d You manage, but the words are tight in your throat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s not in the best way, but I can\u2019t really compare him to you.\u201d Anne mutters gravely.</i></p><p><i>You clear your voice, holding your head in your hand. \u201cH-has he said anything?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot much, just keeps saying that it\u2019s his fault and that he doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d She sounds just as confused as you, maybe even more.</i></p><p><i>You frown to yourself, falling sideways in defeat. He\u2019s always said things along those lines anyway, which have always been ridiculous to you because, if anything, you\u2019re the one that doesn\u2019t really deserve him. Ever since the day you met he\u2019s completely worshipped you, showered you with nothing but compliments, affection, </i>love<i>. Again, he\u2019s never said he loves you, but you can feel that he does just by the way he is with you. You know he was too nervous to say the words in case you\u2019d run off, but you\u2019d be a fucking lunatic to leave him when all he does is love you, and in every possible way, too.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly selfish of me to ask you this when he should be the one apologising to you, but can you come and sort him out?\u201d Anne asks into your silence. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to throw away what he\u2019s got with you because he\u2019s scared, he\u2019ll be an idiot to.\u201d</i></p><p><i>If you\u2019re completely honest you never expected Anne to ask you to come and get him, but you\u2019re so fucking relieved that she has. \u201cYeah, yeah of course I will. I\u2019ll um, get myself sorted.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, love. Never seen him with anyone the way he is with you, I just don\u2019t want him to give it up yet.\u201d</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>The drive was long and tedious. Friday night travelling from Bath to Holmes Chapel? A nightmare. Add half term into the mix and it\u2019s literal fucking hell. Every time you had to slow down you let out a pathetic whimper, and every time the traffic case to a stop you\u2019d squeal.</i></p><p><i>Birmingham was the worst, always will be, it doesn\u2019t really matter what time of day it is.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re just panicked because it\u2019ll be late by the time you get there and you\u2019re already fucking exhausted. You\u2019d only been to Anne\u2019s once, so to say you were proud of yourself for remembering the way was an understatement.</i></p><p><i>Anne already had the door open when you pulled up, a limp smile on her face as she wandered towards you to offer a hug. \u201cThank you so much, love. I\u2019m really happy you came.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m happy you asked.\u201d You mumble, and you\u2019re once again reminded of how similar her embraces are to Harry\u2019s. \u201cDoes he know I\u2019m here?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Anne shakes her head as she pulls back. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t tell him, he\u2019d run off otherwise. He\u2019s in the garden on the bench. I just took some tea out to him because it\u2019s bloody freezing and he\u2019s sat out there in shorts.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That makes you laugh, and you roll your eyes. \u201cDramatic as always.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Anne chuckles lightly, guiding you into the house. \u201cYou go find him. I\u2019ll make you something to eat, I bet you\u2019re starving.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLittle bit, yeah.\u201d You admit with a sheepish smile.</i></p><p><i>She nods in acknowledgment, pointing you in the direction of the back door in case you\u2019d forgotten, before disappearing again. You follow your nose out to the back, ambling into the garden to find him staring at the floor as he sits on the bench under the arbour.</i></p><p><i>As you inch closer you notice the red of his eyes and the fact that he looks like he hasn\u2019t showered in weeks. His hair is covered with a beanie but his stubble is growing into more of a beard, yet he still looked good. Prick.</i></p><p><i>Harry sniffs as you approach, taking a sip of his tea but still never meeting your eyes. \u201cKnew she\u2019d tell you I was here.\u201d He mumbled.</i></p><p><i>You hesitate, rolling your lips into your mouth as you frown. \u201cDon\u2019t be pissed at her, I\u2019ve been pestering her everyday to see if she knew where you were.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019not pissed.\u201d He shakes his head gently. \u201cJust at a bit of a loose end.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your frown deepens, and you move to take a seat beside him. \u201cShe asked me to come, I was just gonna leave you to it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI gathered that, love.\u201d He admits, glancing to you, his eyes lingering over the features of your face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ran off.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take a deep breath and wet your lips. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand, Harry. What happened for you to just abandon me so suddenly? What did I do?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry shakes his head again, angling his body towards you and setting his mug down. \u201cBelieve me, love you did nothing wrong. Nothing at all, it\u2019s all on me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s all on you, Harry? Because you just left, leaving me to think that I was the one who fucked up. You didn\u2019t leave a note, you didn\u2019t answer any of mine or Jeff\u2019s or your mum\u2019s or anyone\u2019s messages. You just disappeared.\u201d You know your voice is getting louder with every sentence, in fact it\u2019s the loudest it\u2019s been for weeks and it\u2019s taken you a little by surprise. You\u2019re not afraid to admit that you\u2019re angry with him either.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI just panicked alright?\u201d He stressed, not even coming close to how frustrated your tone had been because he knew he had no right to yell at you. \u201cI saw something about our relationship that I wish I hadn\u2019t, because it\u2019s true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean? I thought you didn\u2019t care what anyone else said?\u201d You press, still sounding irate.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t, but this one article, that had spread solely from the fact that I refuse to label my sexuality, made some very valid points. You\u2019ve always been very honest with me in that you\u2019re completely monogamous and haven\u2019t experimented much and I\u2019m okay with that. I just think maybe I\u2019m holding you back, I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You stare at him in disbelief. You can\u2019t quite believe that he buggared off because he thinks his sexuality is a big thing to you, it\u2019s baffled you. \u201cOkay, first of all, why do you get to decide if you\u2019re good enough for me? I\u2019ve had this same argument, about you, with my brother. It is no one else\u2019s decision but mine to decide who is good enough for me. Second of all, I have told you on so many occasions that I do not give a shit about your sexuality. Harry, no one has ever treated me with as much care and respect as you do, no one. So whether you\u2019ve slept with just women, just men, or both, anyone, I don\u2019t care. Because at the end of the day you treat me the best, and I am quite frankly the luckiest bitch alive to be on the receiving end of it. If you really want to leave me because you think I don\u2019t deserve you, then fine, I can\u2019t force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I love you and I hated every single second of the past two weeks when you weren\u2019t around.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You hadn\u2019t missed Harry\u2019s eyes light up the moment you said the words, or the way he jolted back slightly and a smile crept onto his face as you finished talking. \u201cYou love me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You roll your eyes and clip the back of his head with your hand. \u201cYeah, I love you! Of course I fucking do!

Her eyes meet Dillon\u2019s across room. \u201cWas that?\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s eyes widen as he grimaces at all the new thoughts running around his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about that, Fee\u2026\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>\u201cAaaah, yeah right there.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no, <i>no.</i>\u201d Aoife cringes as she gingerly gets out of her seat and creeps towards the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go looking, Fee!\u201d Dillon hisses with near disgust.</p><p><i>\u201cThat feel good, love?\u201d</i> Harry\u2019s voice comes clear as day, and Dillon and Fee both groan in horror at the sound.</p><p>\u201cThey know we\u2019re home, right?\u201d Dillon asks nervously as Fee continues out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d She asks a little incredulously, following the sound of the heavy sigh that sounds like it came from you.</p><p>Dillon shrugs, reluctantly following his sister as she creeps towards the living room. More awkward moans filter out of the living room as they grow closer, and the siblings\u2019 cringes only grow deeper.</p><p>When Fee sticks her head around the door frame she can\u2019t imagine ever being more relieved as Harry sits there scratching your back.</p><p>\u201cMum, are you aware of the absolute racket you\u2019re making?\u201d Dillon interrupts before Fee has a chance.</p><p>Harry cackles, glancing at you who\u2019s frowning with offence. \u201cSo what, your mum enjoys a back scratch every now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s fine, but you sound like you\u2019re\u2026 you know, doing the other thing.\u201d Fee continues to wince over her words.</p><p>\u201cOh, for crying out loud.\u201d You huff and stand straight, scowling at your children. \u201cYou really think we\u2019d just do it in the living room with the pair of you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure we\u2019ve done that before\u2026\u201d Harry mumbles, smirking to himself as you smack the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Fee scoffs. \u201cHow could people ever stand to be around the pair of you when you were first together if all you did was make out and\u2026 do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t always that easy, baby girl.\u201d You mumble as you pass, giving her cheek a slight pinch.</p><p>Dillon watches after you with a befuddled gaze before looking back to his dad. \u201cWhat did she mean by that..?\u201d</p><p>~</p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s been fucking two days! And I haven\u2019t heard a peep from him!\u201d You scream down the phone, pacing back and forth in your flat.</i></p><p><i>The rage that had been building and bubbling up inside of you had finally spilled over when Jeff decided to answer one of your calls.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBelieve me, if I knew where he was I would tell you. But I don\u2019t.\u201d Jeff mumbles, a little too calmly for your liking.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Jeff. And you know it is.\u201d You spit back, hitting the door with the palm of your hand as you pass in frustration. \u201cI know he\u2019s with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s not here!\u201d Jeff yells suddenly, startling you for only a moment between your stomping footsteps. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering me either, alright?! I don\u2019t know what you did o-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat I did?!\u201d You can\u2019t believe your ears. \u201cI didn\u2019t </i>do<i> anything! He was in my flat that morning when I left for work, happy as Larry, fine and dandy, same as usual. I called him at lunch and he was still fine. And I came back and he was gone, I didn\u2019t do any-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your ranting is interrupted by Jeff practically squealing your name. \u201cI\u2019m not accusing you of anything, for crying out loud! Your relationship is private, I\u2019ve always respected that, you know that!\u201d </i></p><p><i>You know he\u2019s not finished when he pauses so you just wait for him to speak again, settling into the kitchen table with your head in your hand.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSomething must\u2019ve happened for him to just disappear, but when I say that I\u2019m not accusing you. I don\u2019t know what it is but I\u2019m going to try and find out, alright? I\u2019m with you on this one, I know nothing.\u201d Jeff\u2019s tone is much calmer, more collected as he takes a final deep breath.</i></p><p><i>You follow suit, but you\u2019re on the verge of tears still and not sure what to do with yourself. \u201cIf you hear from him can you just\u2026 at least let me know? You don\u2019t have to tell me where he is or anything I just want to know that he\u2019s alright.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course I will, love. He\u2019ll get past it, I\u2019m sure. Just give him time.\u201d He assures you, though it\u2019s not doing much for the sick feeling in your stomach. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the next few days, alright?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You nod, realising he can\u2019t see you and sighing. \u201cYeah, alright. Sorry for being a bitch. And thank you for your help.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jeff chuckles lightly. \u201cNah you\u2019re fine, don\u2019t blame you at all. Keep your head on, might need it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>It might seem ridiculous to have your back up about Harry being awol for two days, but the thing is he\u2019d always tell you where he was going and what he was doing. Since you\u2019d met nearly a year ago you\u2019d spoken every day without fail, no matter where he was, what time zone, what country, you would always keep a moment in your day for one another.</i></p><p><i>People knew you were a thing now, it was in the media a bit, fans knew you existed and he seemed happy. You\u2019d been spotted together a handful of times and it just wasn\u2019t a secret anymore. You saw each other when you could and it seemed to be going really well.</i></p><p><i>Which is why you couldn\u2019t understand why Harry had just fucked off all of a sudden without a word, not even a note. You\u2019d sent him message after message, and his voicemail was no doubt filling up with your needy messages. You\u2019d barely slept, which might sound dramatic but you had no idea where he was. No one had seen him or spoken to him, he\u2019d just vanished.</i></p><p><i>Even though you couldn\u2019t think of anything, you wondered if you had done something wrong, because there was always that possibility. Maybe you\u2019d said something you shouldn\u2019t have, maybe he found something out about you that he didn\u2019t like. But then even if that was the case he\u2019d usually at least try and talk to you about it rather than just run away.</i></p><p><i>None of it made sense to you. He wasn\u2019t even reading your messages, he just appeared to be ignoring you, completely done with you all of a sudden. You hated it. You hated not having him around, not even being able to chat to him. You\u2019d tell him about literally everything, including what you were having to eat each day, because he\u2019d always seem just so interested, regardless of how mundane it actually was. I was like he was fascinated by you, besotted with you for whatever reason, and now he was bored of you and just sacked you off.</i></p><p><i>If that was the case then he definitely wasn\u2019t the man you thought he was.</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>\u201cStill nothing?\u201d Lana asks as she watches you with a worried frown, taking a seat opposite you with two mugs of tea.</i></p><p><i>You shake your head in response. Your eyes and head feel heavy from all the crying and lack of sleep you\u2019ve had. You don\u2019t trust your voice given you\u2019ve barely said three words apart from when you really have to, that made work extra difficult when the phones were ringing non-stop. You\u2019re lucky your colleagues look after you, using the excuse to everyone else that you\u2019ve got the worst cold and have lost your voice. You\u2019ve been snotting enough for it to look like it. There\u2019s a permanent ache in your chest and you feel a little numb.</i></p><p><i>Again, it all might seem like an overreaction, but the man you\u2019re stupidly in love with, the man you wanted to tell how much you loved him because you haven\u2019t actually said the three words in the right order to his face yet, has completely abandoned you. It\u2019s been a week and you\u2019ve still heard nothing, only the odd phone call from Jeff to update you with any progress.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan stay here with me and Dale if you like?\u201d Lana offers, forcing a smile as she takes a hold of your hand.</i></p><p><i>You love your brother but he\u2019s not been the most understanding of your relationship with Harry. Staying with him now would just make Dale\u2019s opinion of him drop further, and that\u2019s the last thing you want when you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened. You shake your head again and clear your throat. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. Think I\u2019d rather stay out the way until I get over it, but thank you for the offer.\u201d Your voice is so weak, barely audible and cracking over nearly every syllable you speak. The last time you ever heard it so weak was when your ex left, and the horrible thing is you feel way worse about Harry leaving than when he did.</i></p><p><i>Lana nods, half expecting the answer anyway. \u201cThe offer is always there if you change your mind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You attempt a smile back, though it\u2019s really not much to go on. You\u2019d always liked Lana, she was good to your brother and sometimes even better to you. You knew your brother planned on proposing any day now, and that was at least something to feel happy about in amongst this new darkness you\u2019ve found yourself accompanied with.</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnne?\u201d You answer your phone to the frankly unexpected caller. It\u2019s been nearly two weeks now, and you\u2019re slowly starting to accept the fact that Harry probably isn\u2019t coming back to you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHiya, love.\u201d She sounds a little deflated. \u201cHe\u2019s just turned up here, I er, thought you\u2019d like to know.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take a deep breath and carefully lower yourself into the sofa as your stomach falls to the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s with you?\u201d You manage, but the words are tight in your throat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s not in the best way, but I can\u2019t really compare him to you.\u201d Anne mutters gravely.</i></p><p><i>You clear your voice, holding your head in your hand. \u201cH-has he said anything?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot much, just keeps saying that it\u2019s his fault and that he doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d She sounds just as confused as you, maybe even more.</i></p><p><i>You frown to yourself, falling sideways in defeat. He\u2019s always said things along those lines anyway, which have always been ridiculous to you because, if anything, you\u2019re the one that doesn\u2019t really deserve him. Ever since the day you met he\u2019s completely worshipped you, showered you with nothing but compliments, affection, </i>love<i>. Again, he\u2019s never said he loves you, but you can feel that he does just by the way he is with you. You know he was too nervous to say the words in case you\u2019d run off, but you\u2019d be a fucking lunatic to leave him when all he does is love you, and in every possible way, too.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly selfish of me to ask you this when he should be the one apologising to you, but can you come and sort him out?\u201d Anne asks into your silence. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to throw away what he\u2019s got with you because he\u2019s scared, he\u2019ll be an idiot to.\u201d</i></p><p><i>If you\u2019re completely honest you never expected Anne to ask you to come and get him, but you\u2019re so fucking relieved that she has. \u201cYeah, yeah of course I will. I\u2019ll um, get myself sorted.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, love. Never seen him with anyone the way he is with you, I just don\u2019t want him to give it up yet.\u201d</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>The drive was long and tedious. Friday night travelling from Bath to Holmes Chapel? A nightmare. Add half term into the mix and it\u2019s literal fucking hell. Every time you had to slow down you let out a pathetic whimper, and every time the traffic case to a stop you\u2019d squeal.</i></p><p><i>Birmingham was the worst, always will be, it doesn\u2019t really matter what time of day it is.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re just panicked because it\u2019ll be late by the time you get there and you\u2019re already fucking exhausted. You\u2019d only been to Anne\u2019s once, so to say you were proud of yourself for remembering the way was an understatement.</i></p><p><i>Anne already had the door open when you pulled up, a limp smile on her face as she wandered towards you to offer a hug. \u201cThank you so much, love. I\u2019m really happy you came.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m happy you asked.\u201d You mumble, and you\u2019re once again reminded of how similar her embraces are to Harry\u2019s. \u201cDoes he know I\u2019m here?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Anne shakes her head as she pulls back. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t tell him, he\u2019d run off otherwise. He\u2019s in the garden on the bench. I just took some tea out to him because it\u2019s bloody freezing and he\u2019s sat out there in shorts.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That makes you laugh, and you roll your eyes. \u201cDramatic as always.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Anne chuckles lightly, guiding you into the house. \u201cYou go find him. I\u2019ll make you something to eat, I bet you\u2019re starving.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLittle bit, yeah.\u201d You admit with a sheepish smile.</i></p><p><i>She nods in acknowledgment, pointing you in the direction of the back door in case you\u2019d forgotten, before disappearing again. You follow your nose out to the back, ambling into the garden to find him staring at the floor as he sits on the bench under the arbour.</i></p><p><i>As you inch closer you notice the red of his eyes and the fact that he looks like he hasn\u2019t showered in weeks. His hair is covered with a beanie but his stubble is growing into more of a beard, yet he still looked good. Prick.</i></p><p><i>Harry sniffs as you approach, taking a sip of his tea but still never meeting your eyes. \u201cKnew she\u2019d tell you I was here.\u201d He mumbled.</i></p><p><i>You hesitate, rolling your lips into your mouth as you frown. \u201cDon\u2019t be pissed at her, I\u2019ve been pestering her everyday to see if she knew where you were.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019not pissed.\u201d He shakes his head gently. \u201cJust at a bit of a loose end.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your frown deepens, and you move to take a seat beside him. \u201cShe asked me to come, I was just gonna leave you to it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI gathered that, love.\u201d He admits, glancing to you, his eyes lingering over the features of your face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ran off.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take a deep breath and wet your lips. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand, Harry. What happened for you to just abandon me so suddenly? What did I do?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry shakes his head again, angling his body towards you and setting his mug down. \u201cBelieve me, love you did nothing wrong. Nothing at all, it\u2019s all on me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s all on you, Harry? Because you just left, leaving me to think that I was the one who fucked up. You didn\u2019t leave a note, you didn\u2019t answer any of mine or Jeff\u2019s or your mum\u2019s or anyone\u2019s messages. You just disappeared.\u201d You know your voice is getting louder with every sentence, in fact it\u2019s the loudest it\u2019s been for weeks and it\u2019s taken you a little by surprise. You\u2019re not afraid to admit that you\u2019re angry with him either.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI just panicked alright?\u201d He stressed, not even coming close to how frustrated your tone had been because he knew he had no right to yell at you. \u201cI saw something about our relationship that I wish I hadn\u2019t, because it\u2019s true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean? I thought you didn\u2019t care what anyone else said?\u201d You press, still sounding irate.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t, but this one article, that had spread solely from the fact that I refuse to label my sexuality, made some very valid points. You\u2019ve always been very honest with me in that you\u2019re completely monogamous and haven\u2019t experimented much and I\u2019m okay with that. I just think maybe I\u2019m holding you back, I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You stare at him in disbelief. You can\u2019t quite believe that he buggared off because he thinks his sexuality is a big thing to you, it\u2019s baffled you. \u201cOkay, first of all, why do you get to decide if you\u2019re good enough for me? I\u2019ve had this same argument, about you, with my brother. It is no one else\u2019s decision but mine to decide who is good enough for me. Second of all, I have told you on so many occasions that I do not give a shit about your sexuality. Harry, no one has ever treated me with as much care and respect as you do, no one. So whether you\u2019ve slept with just women, just men, or both, anyone, I don\u2019t care. Because at the end of the day you treat me the best, and I am quite frankly the luckiest bitch alive to be on the receiving end of it. If you really want to leave me because you think I don\u2019t deserve you, then fine, I can\u2019t force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I love you and I hated every single second of the past two weeks when you weren\u2019t around.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You hadn\u2019t missed Harry\u2019s eyes light up the moment you said the words, or the way he jolted back slightly and a smile crept onto his face as you finished talking. \u201cYou love me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You roll your eyes and clip the back of his head with your hand. \u201cYeah, I love you! Of course I fucking do!

You left Mum?!\u201d Fee screeches, which could be heard even by you all the way down the hall.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was stupid.\u201d Harry grimaces. \u201cNothing to worry about though, \u2018cause we\u2019re still disgusting and all.\u201d He winks at his daughter who simply scowls. \u201cGo back to your homework.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"286\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harrysofluffy:ngNcr5nwd-2lc3Ux5aA_KA:ZVzCus2XEgZ8V\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/01ab04619e25a80779cccacfb1487b9a/tumblr_p7gxm0SbHc1s77pi1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"286\"></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182919772299/a-series-of-parental-events-masterlist\">Series Masterlist</a>~</b></p><p>Love love love</p><p>Tag list:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> @behdhendud <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@ijustloveharrystyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqFIrbUtoEAyD3S9kiL95Nw\">@gangofhoes</a></p></p>",

But I\u2019m not that clever so we\u2019ll see\u2026 ANYWAY, have 3.5k+ of angst angst and angst for the first time in this series ever! YAAAAAAY! Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cOo that\u2019s it.\u201d</i></p><p>Fee looks up from her homework on the table at the sound of the voice. Her eyes meet Dillon\u2019s across room. \u201cWas that?\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s eyes widen as he grimaces at all the new thoughts running around his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about that, Fee\u2026\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>\u201cAaaah, yeah right there.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no, <i>no.</i>\u201d Aoife cringes as she gingerly gets out of her seat and creeps towards the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go looking, Fee!\u201d Dillon hisses with near disgust.</p><p><i>\u201cThat feel good, love?\u201d</i> Harry\u2019s voice comes clear as day, and Dillon and Fee both groan in horror at the sound.</p><p>\u201cThey know we\u2019re home, right?\u201d Dillon asks nervously as Fee continues out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d She asks a little incredulously, following the sound of the heavy sigh that sounds like it came from you.</p><p>Dillon shrugs, reluctantly following his sister as she creeps towards the living room. More awkward moans filter out of the living room as they grow closer, and the siblings\u2019 cringes only grow deeper.</p><p>When Fee sticks her head around the door frame she can\u2019t imagine ever being more relieved as Harry sits there scratching your back.</p><p>\u201cMum, are you aware of the absolute racket you\u2019re making?\u201d Dillon interrupts before Fee has a chance.</p><p>Harry cackles, glancing at you who\u2019s frowning with offence. \u201cSo what, your mum enjoys a back scratch every now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s fine, but you sound like you\u2019re\u2026 you know, doing the other thing.\u201d Fee continues to wince over her words.</p><p>\u201cOh, for crying out loud.\u201d You huff and stand straight, scowling at your children. \u201cYou really think we\u2019d just do it in the living room with the pair of you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure we\u2019ve done that before\u2026\u201d Harry mumbles, smirking to himself as you smack the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Fee scoffs. \u201cHow could people ever stand to be around the pair of you when you were first together if all you did was make out and\u2026 do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t always that easy, baby girl.\u201d You mumble as you pass, giving her cheek a slight pinch.</p><p>Dillon watches after you with a befuddled gaze before looking back to his dad. \u201cWhat did she mean by that..?\u201d</p><p>~</p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s been fucking two days! And I haven\u2019t heard a peep from him!\u201d You scream down the phone, pacing back and forth in your flat.</i></p><p><i>The rage that had been building and bubbling up inside of you had finally spilled over when Jeff decided to answer one of your calls.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBelieve me, if I knew where he was I would tell you. But I don\u2019t.\u201d Jeff mumbles, a little too calmly for your liking.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Jeff. And you know it is.\u201d You spit back, hitting the door with the palm of your hand as you pass in frustration. \u201cI know he\u2019s with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s not here!\u201d Jeff yells suddenly, startling you for only a moment between your stomping footsteps. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering me either, alright?! I don\u2019t know what you did o-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat I did?!\u201d You can\u2019t believe your ears. \u201cI didn\u2019t </i>do<i> anything! He was in my flat that morning when I left for work, happy as Larry, fine and dandy, same as usual. I called him at lunch and he was still fine. And I came back and he was gone, I didn\u2019t do any-,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your ranting is interrupted by Jeff practically squealing your name. \u201cI\u2019m not accusing you of anything, for crying out loud! Your relationship is private, I\u2019ve always respected that, you know that!\u201d </i></p><p><i>You know he\u2019s not finished when he pauses so you just wait for him to speak again, settling into the kitchen table with your head in your hand.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSomething must\u2019ve happened for him to just disappear, but when I say that I\u2019m not accusing you. I don\u2019t know what it is but I\u2019m going to try and find out, alright? I\u2019m with you on this one, I know nothing.\u201d Jeff\u2019s tone is much calmer, more collected as he takes a final deep breath.</i></p><p><i>You follow suit, but you\u2019re on the verge of tears still and not sure what to do with yourself. \u201cIf you hear from him can you just\u2026 at least let me know? You don\u2019t have to tell me where he is or anything I just want to know that he\u2019s alright.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course I will, love. He\u2019ll get past it, I\u2019m sure. Just give him time.\u201d He assures you, though it\u2019s not doing much for the sick feeling in your stomach. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the next few days, alright?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You nod, realising he can\u2019t see you and sighing. \u201cYeah, alright. Sorry for being a bitch. And thank you for your help.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jeff chuckles lightly. \u201cNah you\u2019re fine, don\u2019t blame you at all. Keep your head on, might need it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>It might seem ridiculous to have your back up about Harry being awol for two days, but the thing is he\u2019d always tell you where he was going and what he was doing. Since you\u2019d met nearly a year ago you\u2019d spoken every day without fail, no matter where he was, what time zone, what country, you would always keep a moment in your day for one another.</i></p><p><i>People knew you were a thing now, it was in the media a bit, fans knew you existed and he seemed happy. You\u2019d been spotted together a handful of times and it just wasn\u2019t a secret anymore. You saw each other when you could and it seemed to be going really well.</i></p><p><i>Which is why you couldn\u2019t understand why Harry had just fucked off all of a sudden without a word, not even a note. You\u2019d sent him message after message, and his voicemail was no doubt filling up with your needy messages. You\u2019d barely slept, which might sound dramatic but you had no idea where he was. No one had seen him or spoken to him, he\u2019d just vanished.</i></p><p><i>Even though you couldn\u2019t think of anything, you wondered if you had done something wrong, because there was always that possibility. Maybe you\u2019d said something you shouldn\u2019t have, maybe he found something out about you that he didn\u2019t like. But then even if that was the case he\u2019d usually at least try and talk to you about it rather than just run away.</i></p><p><i>None of it made sense to you. He wasn\u2019t even reading your messages, he just appeared to be ignoring you, completely done with you all of a sudden. You hated it. You hated not having him around, not even being able to chat to him. You\u2019d tell him about literally everything, including what you were having to eat each day, because he\u2019d always seem just so interested, regardless of how mundane it actually was. I was like he was fascinated by you, besotted with you for whatever reason, and now he was bored of you and just sacked you off.</i></p><p><i>If that was the case then he definitely wasn\u2019t the man you thought he was.</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>\u201cStill nothing?\u201d Lana asks as she watches you with a worried frown, taking a seat opposite you with two mugs of tea.</i></p><p><i>You shake your head in response. Your eyes and head feel heavy from all the crying and lack of sleep you\u2019ve had. You don\u2019t trust your voice given you\u2019ve barely said three words apart from when you really have to, that made work extra difficult when the phones were ringing non-stop. You\u2019re lucky your colleagues look after you, using the excuse to everyone else that you\u2019ve got the worst cold and have lost your voice. You\u2019ve been snotting enough for it to look like it. There\u2019s a permanent ache in your chest and you feel a little numb.</i></p><p><i>Again, it all might seem like an overreaction, but the man you\u2019re stupidly in love with, the man you wanted to tell how much you loved him because you haven\u2019t actually said the three words in the right order to his face yet, has completely abandoned you. It\u2019s been a week and you\u2019ve still heard nothing, only the odd phone call from Jeff to update you with any progress.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan stay here with me and Dale if you like?\u201d Lana offers, forcing a smile as she takes a hold of your hand.</i></p><p><i>You love your brother but he\u2019s not been the most understanding of your relationship with Harry. Staying with him now would just make Dale\u2019s opinion of him drop further, and that\u2019s the last thing you want when you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened. You shake your head again and clear your throat. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. Think I\u2019d rather stay out the way until I get over it, but thank you for the offer.\u201d Your voice is so weak, barely audible and cracking over nearly every syllable you speak. The last time you ever heard it so weak was when your ex left, and the horrible thing is you feel way worse about Harry leaving than when he did.</i></p><p><i>Lana nods, half expecting the answer anyway. \u201cThe offer is always there if you change your mind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You attempt a smile back, though it\u2019s really not much to go on. You\u2019d always liked Lana, she was good to your brother and sometimes even better to you. You knew your brother planned on proposing any day now, and that was at least something to feel happy about in amongst this new darkness you\u2019ve found yourself accompanied with.</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnne?\u201d You answer your phone to the frankly unexpected caller. It\u2019s been nearly two weeks now, and you\u2019re slowly starting to accept the fact that Harry probably isn\u2019t coming back to you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHiya, love.\u201d She sounds a little deflated. \u201cHe\u2019s just turned up here, I er, thought you\u2019d like to know.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take a deep breath and carefully lower yourself into the sofa as your stomach falls to the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s with you?\u201d You manage, but the words are tight in your throat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s not in the best way, but I can\u2019t really compare him to you.\u201d Anne mutters gravely.</i></p><p><i>You clear your voice, holding your head in your hand. \u201cH-has he said anything?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot much, just keeps saying that it\u2019s his fault and that he doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d She sounds just as confused as you, maybe even more.</i></p><p><i>You frown to yourself, falling sideways in defeat. He\u2019s always said things along those lines anyway, which have always been ridiculous to you because, if anything, you\u2019re the one that doesn\u2019t really deserve him. Ever since the day you met he\u2019s completely worshipped you, showered you with nothing but compliments, affection, </i>love<i>. Again, he\u2019s never said he loves you, but you can feel that he does just by the way he is with you. You know he was too nervous to say the words in case you\u2019d run off, but you\u2019d be a fucking lunatic to leave him when all he does is love you, and in every possible way, too.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly selfish of me to ask you this when he should be the one apologising to you, but can you come and sort him out?\u201d Anne asks into your silence. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to throw away what he\u2019s got with you because he\u2019s scared, he\u2019ll be an idiot to.\u201d</i></p><p><i>If you\u2019re completely honest you never expected Anne to ask you to come and get him, but you\u2019re so fucking relieved that she has. \u201cYeah, yeah of course I will. I\u2019ll um, get myself sorted.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, love. Never seen him with anyone the way he is with you, I just don\u2019t want him to give it up yet.\u201d</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>The drive was long and tedious. Friday night travelling from Bath to Holmes Chapel? A nightmare. Add half term into the mix and it\u2019s literal fucking hell. Every time you had to slow down you let out a pathetic whimper, and every time the traffic case to a stop you\u2019d squeal.</i></p><p><i>Birmingham was the worst, always will be, it doesn\u2019t really matter what time of day it is.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re just panicked because it\u2019ll be late by the time you get there and you\u2019re already fucking exhausted. You\u2019d only been to Anne\u2019s once, so to say you were proud of yourself for remembering the way was an understatement.</i></p><p><i>Anne already had the door open when you pulled up, a limp smile on her face as she wandered towards you to offer a hug. \u201cThank you so much, love. I\u2019m really happy you came.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m happy you asked.\u201d You mumble, and you\u2019re once again reminded of how similar her embraces are to Harry\u2019s. \u201cDoes he know I\u2019m here?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Anne shakes her head as she pulls back. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t tell him, he\u2019d run off otherwise. He\u2019s in the garden on the bench. I just took some tea out to him because it\u2019s bloody freezing and he\u2019s sat out there in shorts.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That makes you laugh, and you roll your eyes. \u201cDramatic as always.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Anne chuckles lightly, guiding you into the house. \u201cYou go find him. I\u2019ll make you something to eat, I bet you\u2019re starving.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLittle bit, yeah.\u201d You admit with a sheepish smile.</i></p><p><i>She nods in acknowledgment, pointing you in the direction of the back door in case you\u2019d forgotten, before disappearing again. You follow your nose out to the back, ambling into the garden to find him staring at the floor as he sits on the bench under the arbour.</i></p><p><i>As you inch closer you notice the red of his eyes and the fact that he looks like he hasn\u2019t showered in weeks. His hair is covered with a beanie but his stubble is growing into more of a beard, yet he still looked good. Prick.</i></p><p><i>Harry sniffs as you approach, taking a sip of his tea but still never meeting your eyes. \u201cKnew she\u2019d tell you I was here.\u201d He mumbled.</i></p><p><i>You hesitate, rolling your lips into your mouth as you frown. \u201cDon\u2019t be pissed at her, I\u2019ve been pestering her everyday to see if she knew where you were.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019not pissed.\u201d He shakes his head gently. \u201cJust at a bit of a loose end.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your frown deepens, and you move to take a seat beside him. \u201cShe asked me to come, I was just gonna leave you to it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI gathered that, love.\u201d He admits, glancing to you, his eyes lingering over the features of your face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ran off.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take a deep breath and wet your lips. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand, Harry. What happened for you to just abandon me so suddenly? What did I do?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry shakes his head again, angling his body towards you and setting his mug down. \u201cBelieve me, love you did nothing wrong. Nothing at all, it\u2019s all on me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s all on you, Harry? Because you just left, leaving me to think that I was the one who fucked up. You didn\u2019t leave a note, you didn\u2019t answer any of mine or Jeff\u2019s or your mum\u2019s or anyone\u2019s messages. You just disappeared.\u201d You know your voice is getting louder with every sentence, in fact it\u2019s the loudest it\u2019s been for weeks and it\u2019s taken you a little by surprise. You\u2019re not afraid to admit that you\u2019re angry with him either.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI just panicked alright?\u201d He stressed, not even coming close to how frustrated your tone had been because he knew he had no right to yell at you. \u201cI saw something about our relationship that I wish I hadn\u2019t, because it\u2019s true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean? I thought you didn\u2019t care what anyone else said?\u201d You press, still sounding irate.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t, but this one article, that had spread solely from the fact that I refuse to label my sexuality, made some very valid points. You\u2019ve always been very honest with me in that you\u2019re completely monogamous and haven\u2019t experimented much and I\u2019m okay with that. I just think maybe I\u2019m holding you back, I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You stare at him in disbelief. You can\u2019t quite believe that he buggared off because he thinks his sexuality is a big thing to you, it\u2019s baffled you. \u201cOkay, first of all, why do you get to decide if you\u2019re good enough for me? I\u2019ve had this same argument, about you, with my brother. It is no one else\u2019s decision but mine to decide who is good enough for me. Second of all, I have told you on so many occasions that I do not give a shit about your sexuality. Harry, no one has ever treated me with as much care and respect as you do, no one. So whether you\u2019ve slept with just women, just men, or both, anyone, I don\u2019t care. Because at the end of the day you treat me the best, and I am quite frankly the luckiest bitch alive to be on the receiving end of it. If you really want to leave me because you think I don\u2019t deserve you, then fine, I can\u2019t force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I love you and I hated every single second of the past two weeks when you weren\u2019t around.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You hadn\u2019t missed Harry\u2019s eyes light up the moment you said the words, or the way he jolted back slightly and a smile crept onto his face as you finished talking. \u201cYou love me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You roll your eyes and clip the back of his head with your hand. \u201cYeah, I love you! Of course I fucking do!

Maybe if I&rsquo;m really clever I can strive to get an episode of this out every Sunday? But I&rsquo;m not that clever so we&rsquo;ll see&hellip; ANYWAY, have 3.5k+ of angst angst and angst for the first time in this series ever! YAAAAAAY! Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oo that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Fee looks up from her homework on the table at the sound of the voice. Her eyes meet Dillon&rsquo;s across room. &ldquo;Was that?&rdquo;</p><p>Dillon&rsquo;s eyes widen as he grimaces at all the new thoughts running around his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to think about that, Fee&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Aaaah, yeah right there.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no, <i>no.</i>&rdquo; Aoife cringes as she gingerly gets out of her seat and creeps towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go looking, Fee!&rdquo; Dillon hisses with near disgust.</p><p><i>&ldquo;That feel good, love?&rdquo;</i> Harry&rsquo;s voice comes clear as day, and Dillon and Fee both groan in horror at the sound.</p><p>&ldquo;They know we&rsquo;re home, right?&rdquo; Dillon asks nervously as Fee continues out of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t we be?&rdquo; She asks a little incredulously, following the sound of the heavy sigh that sounds like it came from you.</p><p>Dillon shrugs, reluctantly following his sister as she creeps towards the living room. More awkward moans filter out of the living room as they grow closer, and the siblings&rsquo; cringes only grow deeper.</p><p>When Fee sticks her head around the door frame she can&rsquo;t imagine ever being more relieved as Harry sits there scratching your back.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, are you aware of the absolute racket you&rsquo;re making?&rdquo; Dillon interrupts before Fee has a chance.</p><p>Harry cackles, glancing at you who&rsquo;s frowning with offence. &ldquo;So what, your mum enjoys a back scratch every now and then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah that&rsquo;s fine, but you sound like you&rsquo;re&hellip; you know, doing the other thing.&rdquo; Fee continues to wince over her words.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, for crying out loud.&rdquo; You huff and stand straight, scowling at your children. &ldquo;You really think we&rsquo;d just do it in the living room with the pair of you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty sure we&rsquo;ve done that before&hellip;&rdquo; Harry mumbles, smirking to himself as you smack the back of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s disgusting.&rdquo; Fee scoffs. &ldquo;How could people ever stand to be around the pair of you when you were first together if all you did was make out and&hellip; do it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t always that easy, baby girl.&rdquo; You mumble as you pass, giving her cheek a slight pinch.</p><p>Dillon watches after you with a befuddled gaze before looking back to his dad. &ldquo;What did she mean by that..?&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been fucking two days! And I haven&rsquo;t heard a peep from him!&rdquo; You scream down the phone, pacing back and forth in your flat.</i></p><p><i>The rage that had been building and bubbling up inside of you had finally spilled over when Jeff decided to answer one of your calls.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Believe me, if I knew where he was I would tell you. But I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Jeff mumbles, a little too calmly for your liking.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bullshit, Jeff. And you know it is.&rdquo; You spit back, hitting the door with the palm of your hand as you pass in frustration. &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s with you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here!&rdquo; Jeff yells suddenly, startling you for only a moment between your stomping footsteps. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not answering me either, alright?! I don&rsquo;t know what you did o-,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What I did?!&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t believe your ears. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t </i>do<i> anything! He was in my flat that morning when I left for work, happy as Larry, fine and dandy, same as usual. I called him at lunch and he was still fine. And I came back and he was gone, I didn&rsquo;t do any-,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Your ranting is interrupted by Jeff practically squealing your name. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not accusing you of anything, for crying out loud! Your relationship is private, I&rsquo;ve always respected that, you know that!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>You know he&rsquo;s not finished when he pauses so you just wait for him to speak again, settling into the kitchen table with your head in your hand.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Something must&rsquo;ve happened for him to just disappear, but when I say that I&rsquo;m not accusing you. I don&rsquo;t know what it is but I&rsquo;m going to try and find out, alright? I&rsquo;m with you on this one, I know nothing.&rdquo; Jeff&rsquo;s tone is much calmer, more collected as he takes a final deep breath.</i></p><p><i>You follow suit, but you&rsquo;re on the verge of tears still and not sure what to do with yourself. &ldquo;If you hear from him can you just&hellip; at least let me know? You don&rsquo;t have to tell me where he is or anything I just want to know that he&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course I will, love. He&rsquo;ll get past it, I&rsquo;m sure. Just give him time.&rdquo; He assures you, though it&rsquo;s not doing much for the sick feeling in your stomach. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk in the next few days, alright?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You nod, realising he can&rsquo;t see you and sighing. &ldquo;Yeah, alright. Sorry for being a bitch. And thank you for your help.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jeff chuckles lightly. &ldquo;Nah you&rsquo;re fine, don&rsquo;t blame you at all. Keep your head on, might need it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>It might seem ridiculous to have your back up about Harry being awol for two days, but the thing is he&rsquo;d always tell you where he was going and what he was doing. Since you&rsquo;d met nearly a year ago you&rsquo;d spoken every day without fail, no matter where he was, what time zone, what country, you would always keep a moment in your day for one another.</i></p><p><i>People knew you were a thing now, it was in the media a bit, fans knew you existed and he seemed happy. You&rsquo;d been spotted together a handful of times and it just wasn&rsquo;t a secret anymore. You saw each other when you could and it seemed to be going really well.</i></p><p><i>Which is why you couldn&rsquo;t understand why Harry had just fucked off all of a sudden without a word, not even a note. You&rsquo;d sent him message after message, and his voicemail was no doubt filling up with your needy messages. You&rsquo;d barely slept, which might sound dramatic but you had no idea where he was. No one had seen him or spoken to him, he&rsquo;d just vanished.</i></p><p><i>Even though you couldn&rsquo;t think of anything, you wondered if you had done something wrong, because there was always that possibility. Maybe you&rsquo;d said something you shouldn&rsquo;t have, maybe he found something out about you that he didn&rsquo;t like. But then even if that was the case he&rsquo;d usually at least try and talk to you about it rather than just run away.</i></p><p><i>None of it made sense to you. He wasn&rsquo;t even reading your messages, he just appeared to be ignoring you, completely done with you all of a sudden. You hated it. You hated not having him around, not even being able to chat to him. You&rsquo;d tell him about literally everything, including what you were having to eat each day, because he&rsquo;d always seem just so interested, regardless of how mundane it actually was. I was like he was fascinated by you, besotted with you for whatever reason, and now he was bored of you and just sacked you off.</i></p><p><i>If that was the case then he definitely wasn&rsquo;t the man you thought he was.</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Still nothing?&rdquo; Lana asks as she watches you with a worried frown, taking a seat opposite you with two mugs of tea.</i></p><p><i>You shake your head in response. Your eyes and head feel heavy from all the crying and lack of sleep you&rsquo;ve had. You don&rsquo;t trust your voice given you&rsquo;ve barely said three words apart from when you really have to, that made work extra difficult when the phones were ringing non-stop. You&rsquo;re lucky your colleagues look after you, using the excuse to everyone else that you&rsquo;ve got the worst cold and have lost your voice. You&rsquo;ve been snotting enough for it to look like it. There&rsquo;s a permanent ache in your chest and you feel a little numb.</i></p><p><i>Again, it all might seem like an overreaction, but the man you&rsquo;re stupidly in love with, the man you wanted to tell how much you loved him because you haven&rsquo;t actually said the three words in the right order to his face yet, has completely abandoned you. It&rsquo;s been a week and you&rsquo;ve still heard nothing, only the odd phone call from Jeff to update you with any progress.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can stay here with me and Dale if you like?&rdquo; Lana offers, forcing a smile as she takes a hold of your hand.</i></p><p><i>You love your brother but he&rsquo;s not been the most understanding of your relationship with Harry. Staying with him now would just make Dale&rsquo;s opinion of him drop further, and that&rsquo;s the last thing you want when you really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happened. You shake your head again and clear your throat. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea. Think I&rsquo;d rather stay out the way until I get over it, but thank you for the offer.&rdquo; Your voice is so weak, barely audible and cracking over nearly every syllable you speak. The last time you ever heard it so weak was when your ex left, and the horrible thing is you feel way worse about Harry leaving than when he did.</i></p><p><i>Lana nods, half expecting the answer anyway. &ldquo;The offer is always there if you change your mind.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You attempt a smile back, though it&rsquo;s really not much to go on. You&rsquo;d always liked Lana, she was good to your brother and sometimes even better to you. You knew your brother planned on proposing any day now, and that was at least something to feel happy about in amongst this new darkness you&rsquo;ve found yourself accompanied with.</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Anne?&rdquo; You answer your phone to the frankly unexpected caller. It&rsquo;s been nearly two weeks now, and you&rsquo;re slowly starting to accept the fact that Harry probably isn&rsquo;t coming back to you.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hiya, love.&rdquo; She sounds a little deflated. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just turned up here, I er, thought you&rsquo;d like to know.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You take a deep breath and carefully lower yourself into the sofa as your stomach falls to the floor. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s with you?&rdquo; You manage, but the words are tight in your throat.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah. He&rsquo;s not in the best way, but I can&rsquo;t really compare him to you.&rdquo; Anne mutters gravely.</i></p><p><i>You clear your voice, holding your head in your hand. &ldquo;H-has he said anything?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Not much, just keeps saying that it&rsquo;s his fault and that he doesn&rsquo;t deserve you.&rdquo; She sounds just as confused as you, maybe even more.</i></p><p><i>You frown to yourself, falling sideways in defeat. He&rsquo;s always said things along those lines anyway, which have always been ridiculous to you because, if anything, you&rsquo;re the one that doesn&rsquo;t really deserve him. Ever since the day you met he&rsquo;s completely worshipped you, showered you with nothing but compliments, affection, </i>love<i>. Again, he&rsquo;s never said he loves you, but you can feel that he does just by the way he is with you. You know he was too nervous to say the words in case you&rsquo;d run off, but you&rsquo;d be a fucking lunatic to leave him when all he does is love you, and in every possible way, too.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredibly selfish of me to ask you this when he should be the one apologising to you, but can you come and sort him out?&rdquo; Anne asks into your silence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to throw away what he&rsquo;s got with you because he&rsquo;s scared, he&rsquo;ll be an idiot to.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>If you&rsquo;re completely honest you never expected Anne to ask you to come and get him, but you&rsquo;re so fucking relieved that she has. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah of course I will. I&rsquo;ll um, get myself sorted.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thank you, love. Never seen him with anyone the way he is with you, I just don&rsquo;t want him to give it up yet.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>~</i></p><p><i>The drive was long and tedious. Friday night travelling from Bath to Holmes Chapel? A nightmare. Add half term into the mix and it&rsquo;s literal fucking hell. Every time you had to slow down you let out a pathetic whimper, and every time the traffic case to a stop you&rsquo;d squeal.</i></p><p><i>Birmingham was the worst, always will be, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what time of day it is.</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re just panicked because it&rsquo;ll be late by the time you get there and you&rsquo;re already fucking exhausted. You&rsquo;d only been to Anne&rsquo;s once, so to say you were proud of yourself for remembering the way was an understatement.</i></p><p><i>Anne already had the door open when you pulled up, a limp smile on her face as she wandered towards you to offer a hug. &ldquo;Thank you so much, love. I&rsquo;m really happy you came.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m happy you asked.&rdquo; You mumble, and you&rsquo;re once again reminded of how similar her embraces are to Harry&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Does he know I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Anne shakes her head as she pulls back. &ldquo;No I didn&rsquo;t tell him, he&rsquo;d run off otherwise. He&rsquo;s in the garden on the bench. I just took some tea out to him because it&rsquo;s bloody freezing and he&rsquo;s sat out there in shorts.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>That makes you laugh, and you roll your eyes. &ldquo;Dramatic as always.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Anne chuckles lightly, guiding you into the house. &ldquo;You go find him. I&rsquo;ll make you something to eat, I bet you&rsquo;re starving.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Little bit, yeah.&rdquo; You admit with a sheepish smile.</i></p><p><i>She nods in acknowledgment, pointing you in the direction of the back door in case you&rsquo;d forgotten, before disappearing again. You follow your nose out to the back, ambling into the garden to find him staring at the floor as he sits on the bench under the arbour.</i></p><p><i>As you inch closer you notice the red of his eyes and the fact that he looks like he hasn&rsquo;t showered in weeks. His hair is covered with a beanie but his stubble is growing into more of a beard, yet he still looked good. Prick.</i></p><p><i>Harry sniffs as you approach, taking a sip of his tea but still never meeting your eyes. &ldquo;Knew she&rsquo;d tell you I was here.&rdquo; He mumbled.</i></p><p><i>You hesitate, rolling your lips into your mouth as you frown. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be pissed at her, I&rsquo;ve been pestering her everyday to see if she knew where you were.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;M&rsquo;not pissed.&rdquo; He shakes his head gently. &ldquo;Just at a bit of a loose end.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Your frown deepens, and you move to take a seat beside him. &ldquo;She asked me to come, I was just gonna leave you to it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I gathered that, love.&rdquo; He admits, glancing to you, his eyes lingering over the features of your face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I ran off.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You take a deep breath and wet your lips. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand, Harry. What happened for you to just abandon me so suddenly? What did I do?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Harry shakes his head again, angling his body towards you and setting his mug down. &ldquo;Believe me, love you did nothing wrong. Nothing at all, it&rsquo;s all on me.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all on you, Harry? Because you just left, leaving me to think that I was the one who fucked up. You didn&rsquo;t leave a note, you didn&rsquo;t answer any of mine or Jeff&rsquo;s or your mum&rsquo;s or anyone&rsquo;s messages. You just disappeared.&rdquo; You know your voice is getting louder with every sentence, in fact it&rsquo;s the loudest it&rsquo;s been for weeks and it&rsquo;s taken you a little by surprise. You&rsquo;re not afraid to admit that you&rsquo;re angry with him either.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I just panicked alright?&rdquo; He stressed, not even coming close to how frustrated your tone had been because he knew he had no right to yell at you. &ldquo;I saw something about our relationship that I wish I hadn&rsquo;t, because it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you mean? I thought you didn&rsquo;t care what anyone else said?&rdquo; You press, still sounding irate.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, but this one article, that had spread solely from the fact that I refuse to label my sexuality, made some very valid points. You&rsquo;ve always been very honest with me in that you&rsquo;re completely monogamous and haven&rsquo;t experimented much and I&rsquo;m okay with that. I just think maybe I&rsquo;m holding you back, I&rsquo;m not good enough.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You stare at him in disbelief. You can&rsquo;t quite believe that he buggared off because he thinks his sexuality is a big thing to you, it&rsquo;s baffled you. &ldquo;Okay, first of all, why do you get to decide if you&rsquo;re good enough for me? I&rsquo;ve had this same argument, about you, with my brother. It is no one else&rsquo;s decision but mine to decide who is good enough for me. Second of all, I have told you on so many occasions that I do not give a shit about your sexuality. Harry, no one has ever treated me with as much care and respect as you do, no one. So whether you&rsquo;ve slept with just women, just men, or both, anyone, I don&rsquo;t care. Because at the end of the day you treat me the best, and I am quite frankly the luckiest bitch alive to be on the receiving end of it. If you really want to leave me because you think I don&rsquo;t deserve you, then fine, I can&rsquo;t force you to do something you don&rsquo;t want to do, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I love you and I hated every single second of the past two weeks when you weren&rsquo;t around.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You hadn&rsquo;t missed Harry&rsquo;s eyes light up the moment you said the words, or the way he jolted back slightly and a smile crept onto his face as you finished talking. &ldquo;You love me?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You roll your eyes and clip the back of his head with your hand. &ldquo;Yeah, I love you! Of course I fucking do! I didn&rsquo;t fucking travel up country just to have a fight with you, y&rsquo;fuckin&rsquo; nonce!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Harry catches your hand and drags you across the bench to pull you into his lap, his lips crushing against yours with a brand new sense of emotion. &ldquo;Good, because I love you too.&rdquo; He murmurs against your lips, and you can feel him smiling.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So fucking dramatic.&rdquo; You snort, kissing him back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare ever run off again.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p>~</p><p>Harry pats Dillon on the back as he follows you out of the room. &ldquo;Your dad had a wobble when we were first together. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, you disappeared for a while didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Dillon suddenly remembers, he and Aoife trailing after him.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad! You left Mum?!&rdquo; Fee screeches, which could be heard even by you all the way down the hall.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it was stupid.&rdquo; Harry grimaces. &ldquo;Nothing to worry about though, &lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re still disgusting and all.&rdquo; He winks at his daughter who simply scowls. &ldquo;Go back to your homework.&rdquo;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182919772299/a-series-of-parental-events-masterlist\">Series Masterlist</a>~</b></p><p>Love love love</p><p>Tag list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> @behdhendud <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@ijustloveharrystyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqFIrbUtoEAyD3S9kiL95Nw\">@gangofhoes</a></p></p>",

The man had become quite picky in choosing models now that he had worked with mostly just celebrities. Most of his clients knew exactly how to pose, how to smile, how to act, how to even <i>fake</i> emotions. This time he wanted something new, <i>authenticity</i>, and to be frank, that almost didn&rsquo;t exist in the entertainment industry. So when he left the house on that Sunday morning, the photographer knew better than to build his hopes up, and the last thing he would expect was to stumble across the person he&rsquo;d been looking for.</p><p>But now it was noon, and he was in the park, doing a spontaneous photoshoot with some girl he&rsquo;d met not so long ago; and honestly, that was by far the best thing that had ever happened to him that week. He didn&rsquo;t tell the girl what those shots were for since he knew she didn&rsquo;t really care. She just wanted someone to talk to, and he was happy to be that person.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pose,&rdquo; Isaac said as he lifted the camera again, but the girl sitting on the park bench seemed even more confused by the instruction. She awkwardly sat with her legs crossed and both hands on her knees, like one would do in a high school class photoshoot.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pose, Y/N.&rdquo; He laughed, making the <i>model</i> roll her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; she said, showing a pucker between her brows. Isaac could already tell she was hot-tempered and impatient by nature, but he actually loved it.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what? Let&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; he suggested, leaving her puzzled. &ldquo;Tell me why you were crying.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated,&rdquo; she answered with a subtle smile and he quickly snapped a photo, but she didn&rsquo;t notice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only just met, I don&rsquo;t want to scare you away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Are you a serial killer or something?&rdquo; Isaac clicked his camera again as he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;What if I am?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That makes two of us.&rdquo; He shrugged. One more shot of her laughing was taken. &ldquo;How old are you, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-five.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liar. You&rsquo;re not twenty-five.&rdquo; He scoffed at the playful smile on her face, moving to the left to capture a different angle of the girl.</p><p>&ldquo;How old do you think I am then?&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>And with a smirk, he joked, &ldquo;sixteen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sixteen?!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N gasped, crossing her arms as both of them burst out laughing. She demanded him to be serious and tell her what he really thought, so he said, &ldquo;somewhere between nineteen and twenty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bingo! I&rsquo;m turning twenty next month.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Happy early birthday!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She giggled and saw him snap another photo. &ldquo;How old are you, Isaac?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-four.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know someone who&rsquo;s twenty-four.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, surely I&rsquo;m not the only one in this world who&rsquo;s twenty-four.&rdquo;</p><p>Pressing his lips into a smile, the photographer came to sit down next to the girl and showed her their results. Y/N was so impressed by those photos that she didn&rsquo;t know what to say besides how great she thought they were, but she assumed he&rsquo;d heard that a lot already. As Isaac went back to the very first photo, the one of her crying, he suddenly pressed delete. The photo had vanished by the time Y/N grabbed his wrist and asked him what he&rsquo;d done.</p><p>&ldquo;I like that one!&rdquo; She cried out.</p><p>&ldquo;Let it go, Y/N. You&rsquo;re not that crying girl anymore.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;<i>This</i> is you.&rdquo; The way he&rsquo;d said it while pointing to a photo of her beaming got Y/N blushing hard.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I look weird when I smile,&rdquo; she admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He disagreed, chuckling at the look on her face as she probably assumed he wasn&rsquo;t serious. &ldquo;From the view of a professional photographer, I can confirm that <i>you</i> have a beautiful smile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you calling me a a liar?&rdquo; Isaac seemed offended and she thought it was funny. &ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;m gonna call you Smiley from now on, so you&rsquo;ll remember to smile more often.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s body turned to stone as goosebumps pimpled her skin. Once again, she found herself back in the treehouse, she was standing in front of a boy whose eyes were as green as a meadow on summer days. &ldquo;<i>Bambi,&rdquo; </i>he called her, and she almost answered. But the shade in his eyes was soon washed out by ocean blue when Isaac&rsquo;s voice pulled her back to reality.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He asked, looking quite concerned. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do&hellip;&rdquo; Even Y/N could tell it wasn&rsquo;t hard to make out the insincerity in the way she laughed. &ldquo;You just reminded me of someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boyfriend?&rdquo; The look of disappointment on the man&rsquo;s face got Y/N beaming again. She shook her head and told him it was <i>a</i> <i>boy</i>, but definitely not <i>a</i> <i>friend</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;An acquaintance,&rdquo; she clarified, nodding her head, almost as if she was telling herself. The answer made Isaac seem elated.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t explain those feelings to himself, because it was impossible to fall for someone so fast, yet there he was, wearing his heart on his sleeves while sitting next to a girl four years younger than him. Most of the words in his head had vaporized. It took him nearly a minute to stop fidgeting and finally ask her, &ldquo;do you want to have lunch with me?&rdquo;</p><p>To his delight, she said <i>yes</i> without a pause.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was Monday morning, and Harry was just about to head out when his best friend rang on his doorbell. It should be out of the ordinary to find Isaac Skies standing in front of his house, holding a bottle of champagne with a gold satin ribbon around its neck, but Harry knew exactly the reason why. In fact, he had expected something a bit more extravagant, but maybe that one bottle would do.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as he stepped aside so Isaac could enter. Maybe he was still a little bit upset, but of course, he could never stay mad at his best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you show up yesterday? The models were so mad and I had to apologize on your behalf,&rdquo; he said, watching Isaac set the sorry gift down on the coffee table. &ldquo;I tried calling you but you had your phone turned off. You didn&rsquo;t come home last night and your manager didn&rsquo;t know where you were!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Relax. I was with a girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry leaned a shoulder against the wall, slowly shaking his head at the answer he wasn&rsquo;t so surprised to hear. &ldquo;You bailed on me because you were horny?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you dick. It&rsquo;s not like that.&rdquo; Isaac crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling, lips curved into a smile. Harry had known him for almost six years, so he knew that his best friend didn&rsquo;t get excited for just <i>anything</i>. The last time Isaac smiled that big, he got a shooting contract with one of the biggest fashion magazines in London. So the girl, whoever she was, must&rsquo;ve been very <i>special</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; The photographer sucked in a breath. &ldquo;About the favor I asked you for my exhibition.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you mean, hooking you up with some pretty models so you could blow them off like you did yesterday?&rdquo; Harry rolled his eyes. The sarcasm made his best friend chortle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t need your help anymore,&rdquo; Isaac said. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve found my muse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You slept with some girl <i>one</i> night and now she&rsquo;s <i>your muse</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a dick, Styles. It&rsquo;s not like that. I really like this girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your &rsquo;<i>muse</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo; Harry did an air quote to make fun of the way his friend had referred to a girl he barely knew. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac never got a chance to answer that question, because as soon as he opened his mouth, the notification alerts on their phones grabbed their attention immediately. Both had just received a text from a mutual friend that linked to the same online article. The atmosphere in the room weighted down at once as they both stared at the screens in complete shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you know about this?&rdquo; Isaac was the first to break the silence, but he only to received a simple &rsquo;<i>no</i>&rsquo; from Harry. That question was actually pointless. Had Harry already known, he wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting there like a statue. At first, he could not believe in his own eyes, so he had to go over that article several times to check if it was real; and unfortunately, it was.</p><p><b>ACTRESS </b><b><i>RUBY ELLIS</i></b><b> IS OFFICIALLY ENGAGED!</b></p><p><i>After taking nearly </i><b><i>4 months</i></b><i> off social media, American actress </i><b><i>Ruby Ellis </i></b><i>made a SHOCKING</i><b><i> </i></b><i>return with an </i><b><i>Instagram</i></b><i> post showing her </i><b><i>shiny diamond ring</i></b><i>, and </i><b><i>&ldquo;I said yes!!!&rdquo; </i></b><i>was the caption.</i></p><p><i>Though most fans were happy and excited for the actress, her big announcement has definitely broken lots of hearts, especially for the fans who fell in love with Ellis in her latest film </i><b><i>&ldquo;My Dear Assistant&rdquo;</i></b><i>. Many had been waiting for the actress to confirm her &ldquo;secret relationship&rdquo; with younger co-star </i><b><i>Harry Styles</i></b><i>. However, with that Instagram post, there&rsquo;s no doubt that Ellis is still very in love and happier than ever with </i><b><i>her fianc\u00e9</i></b><i>, 30-year-old actor</i><b><i> James Clark</i></b><i>.</i></p><p>&ldquo;When was the last time you talked to Ruby?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shifted his eyes away from the screen as he heard his best friend&rsquo;s question. He quickly turned off his phone and shoved it back into his pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;Probably a couple months ago&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He shook his head, eyes squeezed shut. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not worth your time, mate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>If Harry had known loving that woman was a waste of time, then that news shouldn&rsquo;t have broken his heart. He knew she&rsquo;d been seeing someone, but he had never expected to find out about their engagement through an online article, just like everyone else. It was heartbreaking how one minute you were everything to someone, and the next you knew as much about them as a stranger on the street.</p><p>Speaking of familiar strangers, he suddenly remembered that he had somewhere else to be.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Isaac asked when Harry came to get his coat on the back of a chair.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to go see someone. Have you got the keys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lock the door on the way out, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac nodded, looking totally perplexed, yet the second he meant to ask, Harry already threw on his coat and walked out the door.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Y/N said those words to Harry at his house yesterday, she believed that would be the last time she saw him. She believed he would leave her alone, like he had many times ago, because that was what most of the people in her life had done. But now, he was standing right outside her door, and before she could say a word, he cut her off and went straight to the point.</p><p>&ldquo;I called your father last night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He told me everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything?&rdquo; She cracked a smile, but it was obvious that she didn&rsquo;t actually think it was funny. &ldquo;Did he tell you about the wedding?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo; Harry nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Did he tell you the woman he was gonna marry was just a few years older than you?&rdquo; Judging from the look on his face, she knew her dad hadn&rsquo;t mentioned it. &ldquo;Did he also tell you that he started seeing her <i>a month</i> after my mother&rsquo;s funeral? That on the night of the accident, there&rsquo;d been a fight and my mother had to leave the house? Did he tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N had never told anyone about that tragical night, not even Celine and Amala; and she let people freely make assumptions about her mother&rsquo;s death. They could believe whatever they wanted to believe, but Y/N knew what really happened, or at least she thought she did.</p><p>On the night of the accident, her parents were fighting like they always had. Eighteen-year-old Y/N must rehearse her speech for the graduation in the morning, so she came downstairs and asked them to lower their voices. But as the girl entered the kitchen, she only saw her dad standing with his head hung low, palms laid flat on the marble surface of the kitchen counter. He told her not to worry, because her mother had gone out to buy her a celebration cake. She could still remember how happy she was when she heard it. She believed him, and went back to her room. Just a couple hours later, the police arrived. Y/N rushed downstairs when she saw the blue and red lights from her bedroom window, just in time to find out there had been an accident.</p><p>Her graduation day was the day her whole world fell apart. She stepped onto the big stage, trembling hands holding the speech she had practiced so many times and remembered every single word by heart. While everyone else was applauding for her motivational words, she was faking smiles, trying to hold back her tears as she looked at the two empty seats in the audience. Y/N broke down the second she stepped down from the stage, and had to be escorted out of the ceremony. Not long after that, the hospital officially announced her mother&rsquo;s death, and on the day that was supposed to be the beginning of a new chapter in her life, she felt like it was the end to everything. So she blamed herself, had it not been for that <i>stupid</i> celebration cake, maybe her mum would never have left the house, and the accident would never have happened.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t her fault. It had <i>never</i> been. She hated how her father had let her believe that she was partly responsible for her mother&rsquo;s death. He could&rsquo;ve told her the truth, that her mother left the house to get away from a terrible fight, there was never a cake. If she&rsquo;d known that, maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t have spent the last two years tormenting herself.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Harry broke the silence that followed after Y/N&rsquo;s story. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was all he could say.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t know. Even my friends don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>The fact that she no longer considered him as her friend made his heart ache, yet he couldn&rsquo;t blame her. He had missed out six years of her life, no friend would do something like that.</p><p>&ldquo;I think they were fighting because my mum found out about the other woman&hellip;&rdquo; She shook her head, eyes glued to her feet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m afraid to ask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you find out about everything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That woman said it herself.&rdquo; Y/N scoffed. &ldquo;She called to tell me about the engagement, then by accident mentioned my parents&rsquo; fight that night, thinking I&rsquo;d already known.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry had no idea what to say next. He had no idea what to do next either. Maybe he should just leave, but that wasn&rsquo;t what he wanted. He wanted to hold her and tell her he would be there through everything, even if she might not believe him after he&rsquo;d failed to keep that promise <i>twice</i>. There were so many plot holes in their story and he didn&rsquo;t know where to begin mending it. He didn&rsquo;t want to stay away and let her do whatever she wanted with her life, because after all, she was still a special part of his childhood, a special part of <i>him</i>. However, she might not want him back into her life, and he would completely understand if she asked him to leave.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Those two words weren&rsquo;t what Harry had expected from her. Now he felt like such an asshole, because he&rsquo;d asked for her address from her father to come and apologize, but she ended up saying it first.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for my attitude yesterday. I was upset about my dad, and his fianc\u00e9, it wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo; Her lips twitched, trying to form a smile, but it was no different from a frown. &ldquo;Thank you for looking after me, but you really shouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p><p>Just like that, she turned to go back inside, about to leave him hanging like she had yesterday, but he couldn&rsquo;t let her walk away from another unfinished conversation. Harry held onto her wrist and pulled her into his arms, risking her pushing him away or even hitting him for touching her without her permission. But she didn&rsquo;t do either of them. She let him hold her.</p><p>Y/N just stood still with her arms glued to her sides and her face against his chest. It took her a moment to finally relax in his embrace, closing her eyes and melting into the warmth of his body. That hug felt different than the one they&rsquo;d shared in the treehouse two years ago, probably because her feelings for him weren&rsquo;t the same.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for everything.&rdquo; He tilted his head down to whisper into her ear. &ldquo;For leaving, for not coming back like I&rsquo;d promised, for the fucked up thing I did before I left again for the second time, I\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>He would&rsquo;ve gone on forever had she not pulled away and interrupted him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not bring up the past, okay?&rdquo;</p><p><i>The past</i>, she meant <i>the kiss, </i>and <i>everything</i> that followed. She&rsquo;d tried to figure it out, to <i>guess</i> what was on his mind when he leaned in and kissed her and she kissed him back. However, she gave up when she realized it didn&rsquo;t have to mean anything. She blamed it on the mixed up emotions, on the spur of the moment, on the pain in her heart for the loss of her mother. And as for him, he must have been just as confused.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t want to know about the woman that had answered the phone, or why he&rsquo;d never called her back, not even once in the last two years. None of that mattered anymore. She&rsquo;d promised herself to give up on him, and she had. There was really no point in asking him to make up a reason or an excuse for what could no longer be changed.</p><p>&ldquo;I talked to <i>someone</i> last night, and that person told me that I needed people in my life. Everyone does.&rdquo; Her lips curved into a small smile, a real one this time. &ldquo;And&hellip;I thought to myself that if I saw you again, I would apologize&hellip;and if you ever&hellip;.want to start over, we can work on that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She&rsquo;d heard him well, she just didn&rsquo;t believe it.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to start over,&rdquo; he repeated himself, more assertive this time as he smiled back at her. &ldquo;I also spent last night thinking about that.&rdquo;</p><p>It was actually the first time in six long years Harry had seen a real smile on his Bambi&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you. I&rsquo;m Y/N,&rdquo; she said with a serious look, which made him laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m Harry,&rdquo; he played along, shaking her hand. &ldquo;Nice to meet you, <i>Bambi</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N invited Harry into her flat. It was small and messy as always, but now that he was already outside her door, she couldn&rsquo;t just ask him to leave. She made him a cup of tea and they sat on the couch, finally opening up to each other for the first time in six years. Of course, both left out many details that they weren&rsquo;t ready to confide just yet, but it was quite a good start. From morning, to noon, and to night, Harry didn&rsquo;t have to think about his ex-lover&rsquo;s engagement, and Y/N had temporarily forgot about her father&rsquo;s. In that small flat, with their phones turned off, completely disconnected with the world, his arm around her shoulders, her head on his chest, it almost felt like they were the same kids they used to be.</p><p>&ldquo;So you study Creative Writing at university?&rdquo;</p><p>The girl nodded as she tossed a gummy bear into her mouth, looking up to meet his eyes. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a terrible writer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remember those stories I wrote in the pink notebook that I used to read to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, those were the best.&rdquo; Harry shook with laughter. &ldquo;I personally loved the chapter about us being secret agents, and shooting laze out of our eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nooooo!&rdquo; Y/N propped herself up to cover Harry&rsquo;s mouth, but he was quick to grab both of her wrists so she couldn&rsquo;t touch him. They were laughing so hard that they almost roll onto the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she trailed off, poking the dimple on his cheek. The girl was practically sitting on his lap now, but they had gotten too comfortable to even care. &ldquo;My writing had never got better than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it supposed to be a bad thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; She chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never gonna write a book that sells.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said the same thing about me being an actor, but look where I am now.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N raised a smile, pushing herself up so her face was at the same level as his. In that moment he stared at her lips, and the way they tasted was still etched on his mind. When she whispered to him, her voice was as warm as the color of her eyes, and he nearly melted all at once into the touch of her hands on his heaving chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you too, Bambi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Y/N batted her eyelashes, looking surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;For still being you, and not giving up.&rdquo;</p><p>It was incredible how fast a moment could change. One second they were dying of laughter and the next, right now, they were just sitting in silence and holding each other&rsquo;s gaze. Having known each other since they were children, but never had they ever got to experience a feeling like this. All of a sudden, everything felt new, and strange, and different,<i> </i>in a <i>good</i> way. Harry parted his lips, about to make a sound, but he forgot what he wanted to say when Y/N pulled away to pick up her phone from the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; She shouted at the time and plunged right out of the sofa, running straight into her room. Harry wasn&rsquo;t used to hearing his little Bambi curse, so the man couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at the word she&rsquo;d just cried out as he asked her what the problem was.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a date in fifteen minutes!&rdquo;</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t the answer he had expected. Harry thought he knew mostly everything about her from all of those stories she&rsquo;d told him from morning till sunset, but somehow she still forgot to mention she had <i>a date</i> that night. He assumed she had forgotten, because she was now frantically running around to find her other shoe.</p><p>&ldquo;Will I get to meet this guy?&rdquo; He shouted out the question when she was in her bedroom changing her clothes.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she shouted back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like him a lot. He&rsquo;s a very nice guy.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t know how <i>nice</i> the mystery man was, but he knew he didn&rsquo;t feel too good about her going on a date. He thought it might have something to do with him knowing her since she was nine, and leaving when she was only fourteen. In his mind, she was still that innocent little girl. It was weird enough to hear her curse, now she was getting ready to go on <i>a date? </i>There was an unsettling feeling inside of him that he couldn&rsquo;t explain.</p><p>A moment later, Y/N emerged from her room, wearing a black bodycon dress which was so short that Harry nearly choked on the gummy bears in his mouth. She spun around and asked him how she looked, and he didn&rsquo;t know what she expected as an answer from him.</p><p>The dress itself, with a plunging neckline and double criss cross straps at the open back, was bound to turn heads already. Now it was on her <i>grown woman body. </i>Harry felt like a pervert for even looking at her from afar. She was beautiful, of course she was, but that was the most skin she&rsquo;d shown since they met again. So a part of him got protective as he asked her if she had a less revealing dress to wear on the first date.</p><p>&ldquo;But I like this one.&rdquo; She laughed as he took a quick glance at her and turned away immediately. &ldquo;H, what are you doing? Look at me as we speak! I&rsquo;m not naked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But someone could look at you right now and imagine that you are!&rdquo; Why did he say that? Now she would think he was imagining her without clothes on. And admittedly, he was trying hard not to. He felt so ashamed for even letting that image cross his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, please tell me you&rsquo;ll wear a coat to cover yourself up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t own a coat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you wear in the winter then?&rdquo; He asked, making her snort. She didn&rsquo;t say anything and just took her purse, telling him to come with her because her date was already waiting outside in his car.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, wait!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry jumped away from the sofa to grab his coat on the hanger by the door and threw it over her shoulders. Y/N refused to put it on, telling him how ridiculous he was, but then she ended up wearing it anyway. He would probably never have let her walk out without the protection of that coat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fourteen years old anymore,&rdquo; she told him with a smile.</p><p>Of course he knew she wasn&rsquo;t fourteen anymore. That fact had been bothering him since he first saw her in that little black dress.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry held the door open for Y/N to walk out on the street. Despite the girl&rsquo;s obvious excitement, he was extremely worried. She looked left and right, then he watched her eyes light up with a smile as she finally spotted the handsome face waiting for her by his black Range Rover. For a second, Harry thought his eyes had fooled him. People could look alike, but as the man finally approached the two of them, Harry was left in shock for the second time that night.</p><p>&ldquo;Isaac?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two know each other?&rdquo; Y/N broadened her eyes, switching them back and forth between the two men whose mouths were both left wide opened.</p><p>A part of Harry wanted to wrap her up with his coat and pull her back inside immediately, another part of him wanted to hear the story of how something like <i>that</i> could even happen. Out of all the men in London, did it have to be <i>his best friend?</i></p><p><i>Wait a minute&hellip;The girl Isaac slept with last night&hellip;His muse&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Is this the girl?! Is Y/N the girl?&rdquo; He raised his voice causing the other two to jump. Y/N didn&rsquo;t understand what he meant, and Isaac was just as loss as she was. It seemed like Harry was the only one out of the three who had an idea what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she was the girl I told you about. Are you two friends?&rdquo; Isaac raised an eyebrow, but he never received a proper answer.</p><p>As soon as Y/N made an attempt to explain her relationship with Harry, he cut her off by telling his best friend, &ldquo;we need to talk. <i>Now</i>.&rdquo;</p>",

The man had become quite picky in choosing models now that he had worked with mostly just celebrities. Most of his clients knew exactly how to pose, how to smile, how to act, how to even <i>fake</i> emotions. This time he wanted something new, <i>authenticity</i>, and to be frank, that almost didn\u2019t exist in the entertainment industry. So when he left the house on that Sunday morning, the photographer knew better than to build his hopes up, and the last thing he would expect was to stumble across the person he\u2019d been looking for.</p><p>But now it was noon, and he was in the park, doing a spontaneous photoshoot with some girl he\u2019d met not so long ago; and honestly, that was by far the best thing that had ever happened to him that week. He didn\u2019t tell the girl what those shots were for since he knew she didn\u2019t really care. She just wanted someone to talk to, and he was happy to be that person.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pose,\u201d Isaac said as he lifted the camera again, but the girl sitting on the park bench seemed even more confused by the instruction. She awkwardly sat with her legs crossed and both hands on her knees, like one would do in a high school class photoshoot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pose, Y/N.\u201d He laughed, making the <i>model</i> roll her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, showing a pucker between her brows. Isaac could already tell she was hot-tempered and impatient by nature, but he actually loved it.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s talk,\u201d he suggested, leaving her puzzled. \u201cTell me why you were crying.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d she answered with a subtle smile and he quickly snapped a photo, but she didn\u2019t notice. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just met, I don\u2019t want to scare you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you a serial killer or something?\u201d Isaac clicked his camera again as he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d He shrugged. One more shot of her laughing was taken. \u201cHow old are you, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. You\u2019re not twenty-five.\u201d He scoffed at the playful smile on her face, moving to the left to capture a different angle of the girl.</p><p>\u201cHow old do you think I am then?\u201d She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>And with a smirk, he joked, \u201csixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen?!\u201d</p><p>Y/N gasped, crossing her arms as both of them burst out laughing. She demanded him to be serious and tell her what he really thought, so he said, \u201csomewhere between nineteen and twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo! I\u2019m turning twenty next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy early birthday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She giggled and saw him snap another photo. \u201cHow old are you, Isaac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know someone who\u2019s twenty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, surely I\u2019m not the only one in this world who\u2019s twenty-four.\u201d</p><p>Pressing his lips into a smile, the photographer came to sit down next to the girl and showed her their results. Y/N was so impressed by those photos that she didn\u2019t know what to say besides how great she thought they were, but she assumed he\u2019d heard that a lot already. As Isaac went back to the very first photo, the one of her crying, he suddenly pressed delete. The photo had vanished by the time Y/N grabbed his wrist and asked him what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI like that one!\u201d She cried out.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Y/N. You\u2019re not that crying girl anymore.\u201d He shook his head. \u201c<i>This</i> is you.\u201d The way he\u2019d said it while pointing to a photo of her beaming got Y/N blushing hard.</p><p>\u201cI think I look weird when I smile,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t!\u201d He disagreed, chuckling at the look on her face as she probably assumed he wasn\u2019t serious. \u201cFrom the view of a professional photographer, I can confirm that <i>you</i> have a beautiful smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me a a liar?\u201d Isaac seemed offended and she thought it was funny. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m gonna call you Smiley from now on, so you\u2019ll remember to smile more often.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s body turned to stone as goosebumps pimpled her skin. Once again, she found herself back in the treehouse, she was standing in front of a boy whose eyes were as green as a meadow on summer days. \u201c<i>Bambi,\u201d </i>he called her, and she almost answered. But the shade in his eyes was soon washed out by ocean blue when Isaac\u2019s voice pulled her back to reality.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked, looking quite concerned. \u201cYou don\u2019t like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do\u2026\u201d Even Y/N could tell it wasn\u2019t hard to make out the insincerity in the way she laughed. \u201cYou just reminded me of someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d The look of disappointment on the man\u2019s face got Y/N beaming again. She shook her head and told him it was <i>a</i> <i>boy</i>, but definitely not <i>a</i> <i>friend</i>.</p><p>\u201cAn acquaintance,\u201d she clarified, nodding her head, almost as if she was telling herself. The answer made Isaac seem elated.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t explain those feelings to himself, because it was impossible to fall for someone so fast, yet there he was, wearing his heart on his sleeves while sitting next to a girl four years younger than him. Most of the words in his head had vaporized. It took him nearly a minute to stop fidgeting and finally ask her, \u201cdo you want to have lunch with me?\u201d</p><p>To his delight, she said <i>yes</i> without a pause.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was Monday morning, and Harry was just about to head out when his best friend rang on his doorbell. It should be out of the ordinary to find Isaac Skies standing in front of his house, holding a bottle of champagne with a gold satin ribbon around its neck, but Harry knew exactly the reason why. In fact, he had expected something a bit more extravagant, but maybe that one bottle would do.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as he stepped aside so Isaac could enter. Maybe he was still a little bit upset, but of course, he could never stay mad at his best friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you show up yesterday? The models were so mad and I had to apologize on your behalf,\u201d he said, watching Isaac set the sorry gift down on the coffee table. \u201cI tried calling you but you had your phone turned off. You didn\u2019t come home last night and your manager didn\u2019t know where you were!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. I was with a girl.\u201d</p><p>Harry leaned a shoulder against the wall, slowly shaking his head at the answer he wasn\u2019t so surprised to hear. \u201cYou bailed on me because you were horny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you dick. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d Isaac crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling, lips curved into a smile. Harry had known him for almost six years, so he knew that his best friend didn\u2019t get excited for just <i>anything</i>. The last time Isaac smiled that big, he got a shooting contract with one of the biggest fashion magazines in London. So the girl, whoever she was, must\u2019ve been very <i>special</i>.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d The photographer sucked in a breath. \u201cAbout the favor I asked you for my exhibition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you mean, hooking you up with some pretty models so you could blow them off like you did yesterday?\u201d Harry rolled his eyes. The sarcasm made his best friend chortle.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t need your help anymore,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my muse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept with some girl <i>one</i> night and now she\u2019s <i>your muse</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, Styles. It\u2019s not like that. I really like this girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour \u2019<i>muse</i>\u2019.\u201d Harry did an air quote to make fun of the way his friend had referred to a girl he barely knew. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>Isaac never got a chance to answer that question, because as soon as he opened his mouth, the notification alerts on their phones grabbed their attention immediately. Both had just received a text from a mutual friend that linked to the same online article. The atmosphere in the room weighted down at once as they both stared at the screens in complete shock.</p><p>\u201cDid you know about this?\u201d Isaac was the first to break the silence, but he only to received a simple \u2019<i>no</i>\u2019 from Harry. That question was actually pointless. Had Harry already known, he wouldn\u2019t be sitting there like a statue. At first, he could not believe in his own eyes, so he had to go over that article several times to check if it was real; and unfortunately, it was.</p><p><b>ACTRESS </b><b><i>RUBY ELLIS</i></b><b> IS OFFICIALLY ENGAGED!</b></p><p><i>After taking nearly </i><b><i>4 months</i></b><i> off social media, American actress </i><b><i>Ruby Ellis </i></b><i>made a SHOCKING</i><b><i> </i></b><i>return with an </i><b><i>Instagram</i></b><i> post showing her </i><b><i>shiny diamond ring</i></b><i>, and </i><b><i>\u201cI said yes!!!\u201d </i></b><i>was the caption.</i></p><p><i>Though most fans were happy and excited for the actress, her big announcement has definitely broken lots of hearts, especially for the fans who fell in love with Ellis in her latest film </i><b><i>\u201cMy Dear Assistant\u201d</i></b><i>. Many had been waiting for the actress to confirm her \u201csecret relationship\u201d with younger co-star </i><b><i>Harry Styles</i></b><i>. However, with that Instagram post, there\u2019s no doubt that Ellis is still very in love and happier than ever with </i><b><i>her fianc\u00e9</i></b><i>, 30-year-old actor</i><b><i> James Clark</i></b><i>.</i></p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you talked to Ruby?\u201d</p><p>Harry shifted his eyes away from the screen as he heard his best friend\u2019s question. He quickly turned off his phone and shoved it back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026Probably a couple months ago\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shook his head, eyes squeezed shut. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not worth your time, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>If Harry had known loving that woman was a waste of time, then that news shouldn\u2019t have broken his heart. He knew she\u2019d been seeing someone, but he had never expected to find out about their engagement through an online article, just like everyone else. It was heartbreaking how one minute you were everything to someone, and the next you knew as much about them as a stranger on the street.</p><p>Speaking of familiar strangers, he suddenly remembered that he had somewhere else to be.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Isaac asked when Harry came to get his coat on the back of a chair.</p><p>\u201cI need to go see someone. Have you got the keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock the door on the way out, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Isaac nodded, looking totally perplexed, yet the second he meant to ask, Harry already threw on his coat and walked out the door.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Y/N said those words to Harry at his house yesterday, she believed that would be the last time she saw him. She believed he would leave her alone, like he had many times ago, because that was what most of the people in her life had done. But now, he was standing right outside her door, and before she could say a word, he cut her off and went straight to the point.</p><p>\u201cI called your father last night,\u201d he said. \u201cHe told me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d She cracked a smile, but it was obvious that she didn\u2019t actually think it was funny. \u201cDid he tell you about the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did.\u201d Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you the woman he was gonna marry was just a few years older than you?\u201d Judging from the look on his face, she knew her dad hadn\u2019t mentioned it. \u201cDid he also tell you that he started seeing her <i>a month</i> after my mother\u2019s funeral? That on the night of the accident, there\u2019d been a fight and my mother had to leave the house? Did he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>Y/N had never told anyone about that tragical night, not even Celine and Amala; and she let people freely make assumptions about her mother\u2019s death. They could believe whatever they wanted to believe, but Y/N knew what really happened, or at least she thought she did.</p><p>On the night of the accident, her parents were fighting like they always had. Eighteen-year-old Y/N must rehearse her speech for the graduation in the morning, so she came downstairs and asked them to lower their voices. But as the girl entered the kitchen, she only saw her dad standing with his head hung low, palms laid flat on the marble surface of the kitchen counter. He told her not to worry, because her mother had gone out to buy her a celebration cake. She could still remember how happy she was when she heard it. She believed him, and went back to her room. Just a couple hours later, the police arrived. Y/N rushed downstairs when she saw the blue and red lights from her bedroom window, just in time to find out there had been an accident.</p><p>Her graduation day was the day her whole world fell apart. She stepped onto the big stage, trembling hands holding the speech she had practiced so many times and remembered every single word by heart. While everyone else was applauding for her motivational words, she was faking smiles, trying to hold back her tears as she looked at the two empty seats in the audience. Y/N broke down the second she stepped down from the stage, and had to be escorted out of the ceremony. Not long after that, the hospital officially announced her mother\u2019s death, and on the day that was supposed to be the beginning of a new chapter in her life, she felt like it was the end to everything. So she blamed herself, had it not been for that <i>stupid</i> celebration cake, maybe her mum would never have left the house, and the accident would never have happened.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t her fault. It had <i>never</i> been. She hated how her father had let her believe that she was partly responsible for her mother\u2019s death. He could\u2019ve told her the truth, that her mother left the house to get away from a terrible fight, there was never a cake. If she\u2019d known that, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have spent the last two years tormenting herself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Harry broke the silence that followed after Y/N\u2019s story. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t know,\u201d was all he could say.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t know. Even my friends don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The fact that she no longer considered him as her friend made his heart ache, yet he couldn\u2019t blame her. He had missed out six years of her life, no friend would do something like that.</p><p>\u201cI think they were fighting because my mum found out about the other woman\u2026\u201d She shook her head, eyes glued to her feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m afraid to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out about everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman said it herself.\u201d Y/N scoffed. \u201cShe called to tell me about the engagement, then by accident mentioned my parents\u2019 fight that night, thinking I\u2019d already known.\u201d</p><p>Harry had no idea what to say next. He had no idea what to do next either. Maybe he should just leave, but that wasn\u2019t what he wanted. He wanted to hold her and tell her he would be there through everything, even if she might not believe him after he\u2019d failed to keep that promise <i>twice</i>. There were so many plot holes in their story and he didn\u2019t know where to begin mending it. He didn\u2019t want to stay away and let her do whatever she wanted with her life, because after all, she was still a special part of his childhood, a special part of <i>him</i>. However, she might not want him back into her life, and he would completely understand if she asked him to leave.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</i></p><p>Those two words weren\u2019t what Harry had expected from her. Now he felt like such an asshole, because he\u2019d asked for her address from her father to come and apologize, but she ended up saying it first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for my attitude yesterday. I was upset about my dad, and his fianc\u00e9, it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Her lips twitched, trying to form a smile, but it was no different from a frown. \u201cThank you for looking after me, but you really shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, she turned to go back inside, about to leave him hanging like she had yesterday, but he couldn\u2019t let her walk away from another unfinished conversation. Harry held onto her wrist and pulled her into his arms, risking her pushing him away or even hitting him for touching her without her permission. But she didn\u2019t do either of them. She let him hold her.</p><p>Y/N just stood still with her arms glued to her sides and her face against his chest. It took her a moment to finally relax in his embrace, closing her eyes and melting into the warmth of his body. That hug felt different than the one they\u2019d shared in the treehouse two years ago, probably because her feelings for him weren\u2019t the same.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything.\u201d He tilted his head down to whisper into her ear. \u201cFor leaving, for not coming back like I\u2019d promised, for the fucked up thing I did before I left again for the second time, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He would\u2019ve gone on forever had she not pulled away and interrupted him. \u201cLet\u2019s not bring up the past, okay?\u201d</p><p><i>The past</i>, she meant <i>the kiss, </i>and <i>everything</i> that followed. She\u2019d tried to figure it out, to <i>guess</i> what was on his mind when he leaned in and kissed her and she kissed him back. However, she gave up when she realized it didn\u2019t have to mean anything. She blamed it on the mixed up emotions, on the spur of the moment, on the pain in her heart for the loss of her mother. And as for him, he must have been just as confused.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to know about the woman that had answered the phone, or why he\u2019d never called her back, not even once in the last two years. None of that mattered anymore. She\u2019d promised herself to give up on him, and she had. There was really no point in asking him to make up a reason or an excuse for what could no longer be changed.</p><p>\u201cI talked to <i>someone</i> last night, and that person told me that I needed people in my life. Everyone does.\u201d Her lips curved into a small smile, a real one this time. \u201cAnd\u2026I thought to myself that if I saw you again, I would apologize\u2026and if you ever\u2026.want to start over, we can work on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019d heard him well, she just didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cI want to start over,\u201d he repeated himself, more assertive this time as he smiled back at her. \u201cI also spent last night thinking about that.\u201d</p><p>It was actually the first time in six long years Harry had seen a real smile on his Bambi\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Y/N,\u201d she said with a serious look, which made him laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Harry,\u201d he played along, shaking her hand. \u201cNice to meet you, <i>Bambi</i>.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N invited Harry into her flat. It was small and messy as always, but now that he was already outside her door, she couldn\u2019t just ask him to leave. She made him a cup of tea and they sat on the couch, finally opening up to each other for the first time in six years. Of course, both left out many details that they weren\u2019t ready to confide just yet, but it was quite a good start. From morning, to noon, and to night, Harry didn\u2019t have to think about his ex-lover\u2019s engagement, and Y/N had temporarily forgot about her father\u2019s. In that small flat, with their phones turned off, completely disconnected with the world, his arm around her shoulders, her head on his chest, it almost felt like they were the same kids they used to be.</p><p>\u201cSo you study Creative Writing at university?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded as she tossed a gummy bear into her mouth, looking up to meet his eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m a terrible writer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember those stories I wrote in the pink notebook that I used to read to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, those were the best.\u201d Harry shook with laughter. \u201cI personally loved the chapter about us being secret agents, and shooting laze out of our eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooooo!\u201d Y/N propped herself up to cover Harry\u2019s mouth, but he was quick to grab both of her wrists so she couldn\u2019t touch him. They were laughing so hard that they almost roll onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she trailed off, poking the dimple on his cheek. The girl was practically sitting on his lap now, but they had gotten too comfortable to even care. \u201cMy writing had never got better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it supposed to be a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m never gonna write a book that sells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said the same thing about me being an actor, but look where I am now.\u201d</p><p>Y/N raised a smile, pushing herself up so her face was at the same level as his. In that moment he stared at her lips, and the way they tasted was still etched on his mind. When she whispered to him, her voice was as warm as the color of her eyes, and he nearly melted all at once into the touch of her hands on his heaving chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you too, Bambi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Y/N batted her eyelashes, looking surprised.</p><p>\u201cFor still being you, and not giving up.\u201d</p><p>It was incredible how fast a moment could change. One second they were dying of laughter and the next, right now, they were just sitting in silence and holding each other\u2019s gaze. Having known each other since they were children, but never had they ever got to experience a feeling like this. All of a sudden, everything felt new, and strange, and different,<i> </i>in a <i>good</i> way. Harry parted his lips, about to make a sound, but he forgot what he wanted to say when Y/N pulled away to pick up her phone from the floor.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d She shouted at the time and plunged right out of the sofa, running straight into her room. Harry wasn\u2019t used to hearing his little Bambi curse, so the man couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the word she\u2019d just cried out as he asked her what the problem was.</p><p>\u201cI have a date in fifteen minutes!\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the answer he had expected. Harry thought he knew mostly everything about her from all of those stories she\u2019d told him from morning till sunset, but somehow she still forgot to mention she had <i>a date</i> that night. He assumed she had forgotten, because she was now frantically running around to find her other shoe.</p><p>\u201cWill I get to meet this guy?\u201d He shouted out the question when she was in her bedroom changing her clothes.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she shouted back. \u201cYou\u2019ll like him a lot. He\u2019s a very nice guy.\u201d</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t know how <i>nice</i> the mystery man was, but he knew he didn\u2019t feel too good about her going on a date. He thought it might have something to do with him knowing her since she was nine, and leaving when she was only fourteen. In his mind, she was still that innocent little girl. It was weird enough to hear her curse, now she was getting ready to go on <i>a date? </i>There was an unsettling feeling inside of him that he couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>A moment later, Y/N emerged from her room, wearing a black bodycon dress which was so short that Harry nearly choked on the gummy bears in his mouth. She spun around and asked him how she looked, and he didn\u2019t know what she expected as an answer from him.</p><p>The dress itself, with a plunging neckline and double criss cross straps at the open back, was bound to turn heads already. Now it was on her <i>grown woman body. </i>Harry felt like a pervert for even looking at her from afar. She was beautiful, of course she was, but that was the most skin she\u2019d shown since they met again. So a part of him got protective as he asked her if she had a less revealing dress to wear on the first date.</p><p>\u201cBut I like this one.\u201d She laughed as he took a quick glance at her and turned away immediately. \u201cH, what are you doing? Look at me as we speak! I\u2019m not naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone could look at you right now and imagine that you are!\u201d Why did he say that? Now she would think he was imagining her without clothes on. And admittedly, he was trying hard not to. He felt so ashamed for even letting that image cross his mind.</p><p>\u201cKid, please tell me you\u2019ll wear a coat to cover yourself up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t own a coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wear in the winter then?\u201d He asked, making her snort. She didn\u2019t say anything and just took her purse, telling him to come with her because her date was already waiting outside in his car.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait!\u201d</p><p>Harry jumped away from the sofa to grab his coat on the hanger by the door and threw it over her shoulders. Y/N refused to put it on, telling him how ridiculous he was, but then she ended up wearing it anyway. He would probably never have let her walk out without the protection of that coat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fourteen years old anymore,\u201d she told him with a smile.</p><p>Of course he knew she wasn\u2019t fourteen anymore. That fact had been bothering him since he first saw her in that little black dress.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry held the door open for Y/N to walk out on the street. Despite the girl\u2019s obvious excitement, he was extremely worried. She looked left and right, then he watched her eyes light up with a smile as she finally spotted the handsome face waiting for her by his black Range Rover. For a second, Harry thought his eyes had fooled him. People could look alike, but as the man finally approached the two of them, Harry was left in shock for the second time that night.</p><p>\u201cIsaac?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d Y/N broadened her eyes, switching them back and forth between the two men whose mouths were both left wide opened.</p><p>A part of Harry wanted to wrap her up with his coat and pull her back inside immediately, another part of him wanted to hear the story of how something like <i>that</i> could even happen. Out of all the men in London, did it have to be <i>his best friend?</i></p><p><i>Wait a minute\u2026The girl Isaac slept with last night\u2026His muse\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cIs this the girl?! Is Y/N the girl?\u201d He raised his voice causing the other two to jump. Y/N didn\u2019t understand what he meant, and Isaac was just as loss as she was. It seemed like Harry was the only one out of the three who had an idea what was going on.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was the girl I told you about. Are you two friends?\u201d Isaac raised an eyebrow, but he never received a proper answer.</p><p>As soon as Y/N made an attempt to explain her relationship with Harry, he cut her off by telling his best friend, \u201cwe need to talk. <i>Now</i>.\u201d</p></p>",

The man had become quite picky in choosing models now that he had worked with mostly just celebrities. Most of his clients knew exactly how to pose, how to smile, how to act, how to even <i>fake</i> emotions. This time he wanted something new, <i>authenticity</i>, and to be frank, that almost didn\u2019t exist in the entertainment industry. So when he left the house on that Sunday morning, the photographer knew better than to build his hopes up, and the last thing he would expect was to stumble across the person he\u2019d been looking for.</p><p>But now it was noon, and he was in the park, doing a spontaneous photoshoot with some girl he\u2019d met not so long ago; and honestly, that was by far the best thing that had ever happened to him that week. He didn\u2019t tell the girl what those shots were for since he knew she didn\u2019t really care. She just wanted someone to talk to, and he was happy to be that person.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pose,\u201d Isaac said as he lifted the camera again, but the girl sitting on the park bench seemed even more confused by the instruction. She awkwardly sat with her legs crossed and both hands on her knees, like one would do in a high school class photoshoot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pose, Y/N.\u201d He laughed, making the <i>model</i> roll her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, showing a pucker between her brows. Isaac could already tell she was hot-tempered and impatient by nature, but he actually loved it.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s talk,\u201d he suggested, leaving her puzzled. \u201cTell me why you were crying.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d she answered with a subtle smile and he quickly snapped a photo, but she didn\u2019t notice. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just met, I don\u2019t want to scare you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you a serial killer or something?\u201d Isaac clicked his camera again as he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d He shrugged. One more shot of her laughing was taken. \u201cHow old are you, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. You\u2019re not twenty-five.\u201d He scoffed at the playful smile on her face, moving to the left to capture a different angle of the girl.</p><p>\u201cHow old do you think I am then?\u201d She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>And with a smirk, he joked, \u201csixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen?!\u201d</p><p>Y/N gasped, crossing her arms as both of them burst out laughing. She demanded him to be serious and tell her what he really thought, so he said, \u201csomewhere between nineteen and twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo! I\u2019m turning twenty next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy early birthday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She giggled and saw him snap another photo. \u201cHow old are you, Isaac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know someone who\u2019s twenty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, surely I\u2019m not the only one in this world who\u2019s twenty-four.\u201d</p><p>Pressing his lips into a smile, the photographer came to sit down next to the girl and showed her their results. Y/N was so impressed by those photos that she didn\u2019t know what to say besides how great she thought they were, but she assumed he\u2019d heard that a lot already. As Isaac went back to the very first photo, the one of her crying, he suddenly pressed delete. The photo had vanished by the time Y/N grabbed his wrist and asked him what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI like that one!\u201d She cried out.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Y/N. You\u2019re not that crying girl anymore.\u201d He shook his head. \u201c<i>This</i> is you.\u201d The way he\u2019d said it while pointing to a photo of her beaming got Y/N blushing hard.</p><p>\u201cI think I look weird when I smile,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t!\u201d He disagreed, chuckling at the look on her face as she probably assumed he wasn\u2019t serious. \u201cFrom the view of a professional photographer, I can confirm that <i>you</i> have a beautiful smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me a a liar?\u201d Isaac seemed offended and she thought it was funny. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m gonna call you Smiley from now on, so you\u2019ll remember to smile more often.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s body turned to stone as goosebumps pimpled her skin. Once again, she found herself back in the treehouse, she was standing in front of a boy whose eyes were as green as a meadow on summer days. \u201c<i>Bambi,\u201d </i>he called her, and she almost answered. But the shade in his eyes was soon washed out by ocean blue when Isaac\u2019s voice pulled her back to reality.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked, looking quite concerned. \u201cYou don\u2019t like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do\u2026\u201d Even Y/N could tell it wasn\u2019t hard to make out the insincerity in the way she laughed. \u201cYou just reminded me of someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d The look of disappointment on the man\u2019s face got Y/N beaming again. She shook her head and told him it was <i>a</i> <i>boy</i>, but definitely not <i>a</i> <i>friend</i>.</p><p>\u201cAn acquaintance,\u201d she clarified, nodding her head, almost as if she was telling herself. The answer made Isaac seem elated.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t explain those feelings to himself, because it was impossible to fall for someone so fast, yet there he was, wearing his heart on his sleeves while sitting next to a girl four years younger than him. Most of the words in his head had vaporized. It took him nearly a minute to stop fidgeting and finally ask her, \u201cdo you want to have lunch with me?\u201d</p><p>To his delight, she said <i>yes</i> without a pause.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was Monday morning, and Harry was just about to head out when his best friend rang on his doorbell. It should be out of the ordinary to find Isaac Skies standing in front of his house, holding a bottle of champagne with a gold satin ribbon around its neck, but Harry knew exactly the reason why. In fact, he had expected something a bit more extravagant, but maybe that one bottle would do.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as he stepped aside so Isaac could enter. Maybe he was still a little bit upset, but of course, he could never stay mad at his best friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you show up yesterday? The models were so mad and I had to apologize on your behalf,\u201d he said, watching Isaac set the sorry gift down on the coffee table. \u201cI tried calling you but you had your phone turned off. You didn\u2019t come home last night and your manager didn\u2019t know where you were!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. I was with a girl.\u201d</p><p>Harry leaned a shoulder against the wall, slowly shaking his head at the answer he wasn\u2019t so surprised to hear. \u201cYou bailed on me because you were horny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you dick. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d Isaac crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling, lips curved into a smile. Harry had known him for almost six years, so he knew that his best friend didn\u2019t get excited for just <i>anything</i>. The last time Isaac smiled that big, he got a shooting contract with one of the biggest fashion magazines in London. So the girl, whoever she was, must\u2019ve been very <i>special</i>.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d The photographer sucked in a breath. \u201cAbout the favor I asked you for my exhibition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you mean, hooking you up with some pretty models so you could blow them off like you did yesterday?\u201d Harry rolled his eyes. The sarcasm made his best friend chortle.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t need your help anymore,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my muse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept with some girl <i>one</i> night and now she\u2019s <i>your muse</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, Styles. It\u2019s not like that. I really like this girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour \u2019<i>muse</i>\u2019.\u201d Harry did an air quote to make fun of the way his friend had referred to a girl he barely knew. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>Isaac never got a chance to answer that question, because as soon as he opened his mouth, the notification alerts on their phones grabbed their attention immediately. Both had just received a text from a mutual friend that linked to the same online article. The atmosphere in the room weighted down at once as they both stared at the screens in complete shock.</p><p>\u201cDid you know about this?\u201d Isaac was the first to break the silence, but he only to received a simple \u2019<i>no</i>\u2019 from Harry. That question was actually pointless. Had Harry already known, he wouldn\u2019t be sitting there like a statue. At first, he could not believe in his own eyes, so he had to go over that article several times to check if it was real; and unfortunately, it was.</p><p><b>ACTRESS </b><b><i>RUBY ELLIS</i></b><b> IS OFFICIALLY ENGAGED!</b></p><p><i>After taking nearly </i><b><i>4 months</i></b><i> off social media, American actress </i><b><i>Ruby Ellis </i></b><i>made a SHOCKING</i><b><i> </i></b><i>return with an </i><b><i>Instagram</i></b><i> post showing her </i><b><i>shiny diamond ring</i></b><i>, and </i><b><i>\u201cI said yes!!!\u201d </i></b><i>was the caption.</i></p><p><i>Though most fans were happy and excited for the actress, her big announcement has definitely broken lots of hearts, especially for the fans who fell in love with Ellis in her latest film </i><b><i>\u201cMy Dear Assistant\u201d</i></b><i>. Many had been waiting for the actress to confirm her \u201csecret relationship\u201d with younger co-star </i><b><i>Harry Styles</i></b><i>. However, with that Instagram post, there\u2019s no doubt that Ellis is still very in love and happier than ever with </i><b><i>her fianc\u00e9</i></b><i>, 30-year-old actor</i><b><i> James Clark</i></b><i>.</i></p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you talked to Ruby?\u201d</p><p>Harry shifted his eyes away from the screen as he heard his best friend\u2019s question. He quickly turned off his phone and shoved it back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026Probably a couple months ago\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shook his head, eyes squeezed shut. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not worth your time, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>If Harry had known loving that woman was a waste of time, then that news shouldn\u2019t have broken his heart. He knew she\u2019d been seeing someone, but he had never expected to find out about their engagement through an online article, just like everyone else. It was heartbreaking how one minute you were everything to someone, and the next you knew as much about them as a stranger on the street.</p><p>Speaking of familiar strangers, he suddenly remembered that he had somewhere else to be.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Isaac asked when Harry came to get his coat on the back of a chair.</p><p>\u201cI need to go see someone. Have you got the keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock the door on the way out, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Isaac nodded, looking totally perplexed, yet the second he meant to ask, Harry already threw on his coat and walked out the door.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Y/N said those words to Harry at his house yesterday, she believed that would be the last time she saw him. She believed he would leave her alone, like he had many times ago, because that was what most of the people in her life had done. But now, he was standing right outside her door, and before she could say a word, he cut her off and went straight to the point.</p><p>\u201cI called your father last night,\u201d he said. \u201cHe told me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d She cracked a smile, but it was obvious that she didn\u2019t actually think it was funny. \u201cDid he tell you about the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did.\u201d Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you the woman he was gonna marry was just a few years older than you?\u201d Judging from the look on his face, she knew her dad hadn\u2019t mentioned it. \u201cDid he also tell you that he started seeing her <i>a month</i> after my mother\u2019s funeral? That on the night of the accident, there\u2019d been a fight and my mother had to leave the house? Did he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>Y/N had never told anyone about that tragical night, not even Celine and Amala; and she let people freely make assumptions about her mother\u2019s death. They could believe whatever they wanted to believe, but Y/N knew what really happened, or at least she thought she did.</p><p>On the night of the accident, her parents were fighting like they always had. Eighteen-year-old Y/N must rehearse her speech for the graduation in the morning, so she came downstairs and asked them to lower their voices. But as the girl entered the kitchen, she only saw her dad standing with his head hung low, palms laid flat on the marble surface of the kitchen counter. He told her not to worry, because her mother had gone out to buy her a celebration cake. She could still remember how happy she was when she heard it. She believed him, and went back to her room. Just a couple hours later, the police arrived. Y/N rushed downstairs when she saw the blue and red lights from her bedroom window, just in time to find out there had been an accident.</p><p>Her graduation day was the day her whole world fell apart. She stepped onto the big stage, trembling hands holding the speech she had practiced so many times and remembered every single word by heart. While everyone else was applauding for her motivational words, she was faking smiles, trying to hold back her tears as she looked at the two empty seats in the audience. Y/N broke down the second she stepped down from the stage, and had to be escorted out of the ceremony. Not long after that, the hospital officially announced her mother\u2019s death, and on the day that was supposed to be the beginning of a new chapter in her life, she felt like it was the end to everything. So she blamed herself, had it not been for that <i>stupid</i> celebration cake, maybe her mum would never have left the house, and the accident would never have happened.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t her fault. It had <i>never</i> been. She hated how her father had let her believe that she was partly responsible for her mother\u2019s death. He could\u2019ve told her the truth, that her mother left the house to get away from a terrible fight, there was never a cake. If she\u2019d known that, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have spent the last two years tormenting herself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Harry broke the silence that followed after Y/N\u2019s story. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t know,\u201d was all he could say.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t know. Even my friends don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The fact that she no longer considered him as her friend made his heart ache, yet he couldn\u2019t blame her. He had missed out six years of her life, no friend would do something like that.</p><p>\u201cI think they were fighting because my mum found out about the other woman\u2026\u201d She shook her head, eyes glued to her feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m afraid to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out about everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman said it herself.\u201d Y/N scoffed. \u201cShe called to tell me about the engagement, then by accident mentioned my parents\u2019 fight that night, thinking I\u2019d already known.\u201d</p><p>Harry had no idea what to say next. He had no idea what to do next either. Maybe he should just leave, but that wasn\u2019t what he wanted. He wanted to hold her and tell her he would be there through everything, even if she might not believe him after he\u2019d failed to keep that promise <i>twice</i>. There were so many plot holes in their story and he didn\u2019t know where to begin mending it. He didn\u2019t want to stay away and let her do whatever she wanted with her life, because after all, she was still a special part of his childhood, a special part of <i>him</i>. However, she might not want him back into her life, and he would completely understand if she asked him to leave.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</i></p><p>Those two words weren\u2019t what Harry had expected from her. Now he felt like such an asshole, because he\u2019d asked for her address from her father to come and apologize, but she ended up saying it first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for my attitude yesterday. I was upset about my dad, and his fianc\u00e9, it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Her lips twitched, trying to form a smile, but it was no different from a frown. \u201cThank you for looking after me, but you really shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, she turned to go back inside, about to leave him hanging like she had yesterday, but he couldn\u2019t let her walk away from another unfinished conversation. Harry held onto her wrist and pulled her into his arms, risking her pushing him away or even hitting him for touching her without her permission. But she didn\u2019t do either of them. She let him hold her.</p><p>Y/N just stood still with her arms glued to her sides and her face against his chest. It took her a moment to finally relax in his embrace, closing her eyes and melting into the warmth of his body. That hug felt different than the one they\u2019d shared in the treehouse two years ago, probably because her feelings for him weren\u2019t the same.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything.\u201d He tilted his head down to whisper into her ear. \u201cFor leaving, for not coming back like I\u2019d promised, for the fucked up thing I did before I left again for the second time, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He would\u2019ve gone on forever had she not pulled away and interrupted him. \u201cLet\u2019s not bring up the past, okay?\u201d</p><p><i>The past</i>, she meant <i>the kiss, </i>and <i>everything</i> that followed. She\u2019d tried to figure it out, to <i>guess</i> what was on his mind when he leaned in and kissed her and she kissed him back. However, she gave up when she realized it didn\u2019t have to mean anything. She blamed it on the mixed up emotions, on the spur of the moment, on the pain in her heart for the loss of her mother. And as for him, he must have been just as confused.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to know about the woman that had answered the phone, or why he\u2019d never called her back, not even once in the last two years. None of that mattered anymore. She\u2019d promised herself to give up on him, and she had. There was really no point in asking him to make up a reason or an excuse for what could no longer be changed.</p><p>\u201cI talked to <i>someone</i> last night, and that person told me that I needed people in my life. Everyone does.\u201d Her lips curved into a small smile, a real one this time. \u201cAnd\u2026I thought to myself that if I saw you again, I would apologize\u2026and if you ever\u2026.want to start over, we can work on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019d heard him well, she just didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cI want to start over,\u201d he repeated himself, more assertive this time as he smiled back at her. \u201cI also spent last night thinking about that.\u201d</p><p>It was actually the first time in six long years Harry had seen a real smile on his Bambi\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Y/N,\u201d she said with a serious look, which made him laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Harry,\u201d he played along, shaking her hand. \u201cNice to meet you, <i>Bambi</i>.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N invited Harry into her flat. It was small and messy as always, but now that he was already outside her door, she couldn\u2019t just ask him to leave. She made him a cup of tea and they sat on the couch, finally opening up to each other for the first time in six years. Of course, both left out many details that they weren\u2019t ready to confide just yet, but it was quite a good start. From morning, to noon, and to night, Harry didn\u2019t have to think about his ex-lover\u2019s engagement, and Y/N had temporarily forgot about her father\u2019s. In that small flat, with their phones turned off, completely disconnected with the world, his arm around her shoulders, her head on his chest, it almost felt like they were the same kids they used to be.</p><p>\u201cSo you study Creative Writing at university?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded as she tossed a gummy bear into her mouth, looking up to meet his eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m a terrible writer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember those stories I wrote in the pink notebook that I used to read to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, those were the best.\u201d Harry shook with laughter. \u201cI personally loved the chapter about us being secret agents, and shooting laze out of our eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooooo!\u201d Y/N propped herself up to cover Harry\u2019s mouth, but he was quick to grab both of her wrists so she couldn\u2019t touch him. They were laughing so hard that they almost roll onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she trailed off, poking the dimple on his cheek. The girl was practically sitting on his lap now, but they had gotten too comfortable to even care. \u201cMy writing had never got better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it supposed to be a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m never gonna write a book that sells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said the same thing about me being an actor, but look where I am now.\u201d</p><p>Y/N raised a smile, pushing herself up so her face was at the same level as his. In that moment he stared at her lips, and the way they tasted was still etched on his mind. When she whispered to him, her voice was as warm as the color of her eyes, and he nearly melted all at once into the touch of her hands on his heaving chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you too, Bambi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Y/N batted her eyelashes, looking surprised.</p><p>\u201cFor still being you, and not giving up.\u201d</p><p>It was incredible how fast a moment could change. One second they were dying of laughter and the next, right now, they were just sitting in silence and holding each other\u2019s gaze. Having known each other since they were children, but never had they ever got to experience a feeling like this. All of a sudden, everything felt new, and strange, and different,<i> </i>in a <i>good</i> way. Harry parted his lips, about to make a sound, but he forgot what he wanted to say when Y/N pulled away to pick up her phone from the floor.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d She shouted at the time and plunged right out of the sofa, running straight into her room. Harry wasn\u2019t used to hearing his little Bambi curse, so the man couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the word she\u2019d just cried out as he asked her what the problem was.</p><p>\u201cI have a date in fifteen minutes!\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the answer he had expected. Harry thought he knew mostly everything about her from all of those stories she\u2019d told him from morning till sunset, but somehow she still forgot to mention she had <i>a date</i> that night. He assumed she had forgotten, because she was now frantically running around to find her other shoe.</p><p>\u201cWill I get to meet this guy?\u201d He shouted out the question when she was in her bedroom changing her clothes.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she shouted back. \u201cYou\u2019ll like him a lot. He\u2019s a very nice guy.\u201d</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t know how <i>nice</i> the mystery man was, but he knew he didn\u2019t feel too good about her going on a date. He thought it might have something to do with him knowing her since she was nine, and leaving when she was only fourteen. In his mind, she was still that innocent little girl. It was weird enough to hear her curse, now she was getting ready to go on <i>a date? </i>There was an unsettling feeling inside of him that he couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>A moment later, Y/N emerged from her room, wearing a black bodycon dress which was so short that Harry nearly choked on the gummy bears in his mouth. She spun around and asked him how she looked, and he didn\u2019t know what she expected as an answer from him.</p><p>The dress itself, with a plunging neckline and double criss cross straps at the open back, was bound to turn heads already. Now it was on her <i>grown woman body. </i>Harry felt like a pervert for even looking at her from afar. She was beautiful, of course she was, but that was the most skin she\u2019d shown since they met again. So a part of him got protective as he asked her if she had a less revealing dress to wear on the first date.</p><p>\u201cBut I like this one.\u201d She laughed as he took a quick glance at her and turned away immediately. \u201cH, what are you doing? Look at me as we speak! I\u2019m not naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone could look at you right now and imagine that you are!\u201d Why did he say that? Now she would think he was imagining her without clothes on. And admittedly, he was trying hard not to. He felt so ashamed for even letting that image cross his mind.</p><p>\u201cKid, please tell me you\u2019ll wear a coat to cover yourself up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t own a coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wear in the winter then?\u201d He asked, making her snort. She didn\u2019t say anything and just took her purse, telling him to come with her because her date was already waiting outside in his car.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait!\u201d</p><p>Harry jumped away from the sofa to grab his coat on the hanger by the door and threw it over her shoulders. Y/N refused to put it on, telling him how ridiculous he was, but then she ended up wearing it anyway. He would probably never have let her walk out without the protection of that coat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fourteen years old anymore,\u201d she told him with a smile.</p><p>Of course he knew she wasn\u2019t fourteen anymore. That fact had been bothering him since he first saw her in that little black dress.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry held the door open for Y/N to walk out on the street. Despite the girl\u2019s obvious excitement, he was extremely worried. She looked left and right, then he watched her eyes light up with a smile as she finally spotted the handsome face waiting for her by his black Range Rover. For a second, Harry thought his eyes had fooled him. People could look alike, but as the man finally approached the two of them, Harry was left in shock for the second time that night.</p><p>\u201cIsaac?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d Y/N broadened her eyes, switching them back and forth between the two men whose mouths were both left wide opened.</p><p>A part of Harry wanted to wrap her up with his coat and pull her back inside immediately, another part of him wanted to hear the story of how something like <i>that</i> could even happen. Out of all the men in London, did it have to be <i>his best friend?</i></p><p><i>Wait a minute\u2026The girl Isaac slept with last night\u2026His muse\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cIs this the girl?! Is Y/N the girl?\u201d He raised his voice causing the other two to jump. Y/N didn\u2019t understand what he meant, and Isaac was just as loss as she was. It seemed like Harry was the only one out of the three who had an idea what was going on.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was the girl I told you about. Are you two friends?\u201d Isaac raised an eyebrow, but he never received a proper answer.</p><p>As soon as Y/N made an attempt to explain her relationship with Harry, he cut her off by telling his best friend, \u201cwe need to talk. <i>Now</i>.\u201d</p></p>",

The man had become quite picky in choosing models now that he had worked with mostly just celebrities. Most of his clients knew exactly how to pose, how to smile, how to act, how to even <i>fake</i> emotions. This time he wanted something new, <i>authenticity</i>, and to be frank, that almost didn&rsquo;t exist in the entertainment industry. So when he left the house on that Sunday morning, the photographer knew better than to build his hopes up, and the last thing he would expect was to stumble across the person he&rsquo;d been looking for.</p><p>But now it was noon, and he was in the park, doing a spontaneous photoshoot with some girl he&rsquo;d met not so long ago; and honestly, that was by far the best thing that had ever happened to him that week. He didn&rsquo;t tell the girl what those shots were for since he knew she didn&rsquo;t really care. She just wanted someone to talk to, and he was happy to be that person.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pose,&rdquo; Isaac said as he lifted the camera again, but the girl sitting on the park bench seemed even more confused by the instruction. She awkwardly sat with her legs crossed and both hands on her knees, like one would do in a high school class photoshoot.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pose, Y/N.&rdquo; He laughed, making the <i>model</i> roll her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; she said, showing a pucker between her brows. Isaac could already tell she was hot-tempered and impatient by nature, but he actually loved it.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what? Let&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; he suggested, leaving her puzzled. &ldquo;Tell me why you were crying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated,&rdquo; she answered with a subtle smile and he quickly snapped a photo, but she didn&rsquo;t notice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only just met, I don&rsquo;t want to scare you away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Are you a serial killer or something?&rdquo; Isaac clicked his camera again as he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;What if I am?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That makes two of us.&rdquo; He shrugged. One more shot of her laughing was taken. &ldquo;How old are you, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-five.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liar. You&rsquo;re not twenty-five.&rdquo; He scoffed at the playful smile on her face, moving to the left to capture a different angle of the girl.</p><p>&ldquo;How old do you think I am then?&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>And with a smirk, he joked, &ldquo;sixteen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sixteen?!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N gasped, crossing her arms as both of them burst out laughing. She demanded him to be serious and tell her what he really thought, so he said, &ldquo;somewhere between nineteen and twenty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bingo! I&rsquo;m turning twenty next month.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Happy early birthday!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She giggled and saw him snap another photo. &ldquo;How old are you, Isaac?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-four.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know someone who&rsquo;s twenty-four.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, surely I&rsquo;m not the only one in this world who&rsquo;s twenty-four.&rdquo;</p><p>Pressing his lips into a smile, the photographer came to sit down next to the girl and showed her their results. Y/N was so impressed by those photos that she didn&rsquo;t know what to say besides how great she thought they were, but she assumed he&rsquo;d heard that a lot already. As Isaac went back to the very first photo, the one of her crying, he suddenly pressed delete. The photo had vanished by the time Y/N grabbed his wrist and asked him what he&rsquo;d done.</p><p>&ldquo;I like that one!&rdquo; She cried out.</p><p>&ldquo;Let it go, Y/N. You&rsquo;re not that crying girl anymore.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;<i>This</i> is you.&rdquo; The way he&rsquo;d said it while pointing to a photo of her beaming got Y/N blushing hard.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I look weird when I smile,&rdquo; she admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He disagreed, chuckling at the look on her face as she probably assumed he wasn&rsquo;t serious. &ldquo;From the view of a professional photographer, I can confirm that <i>you</i> have a beautiful smile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you calling me a a liar?&rdquo; Isaac seemed offended and she thought it was funny. &ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;m gonna call you Smiley from now on, so you&rsquo;ll remember to smile more often.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s body turned to stone as goosebumps pimpled her skin. Once again, she found herself back in the treehouse, she was standing in front of a boy whose eyes were as green as a meadow on summer days. &ldquo;<i>Bambi,&rdquo; </i>he called her, and she almost answered. But the shade in his eyes was soon washed out by ocean blue when Isaac&rsquo;s voice pulled her back to reality.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He asked, looking quite concerned. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do&hellip;&rdquo; Even Y/N could tell it wasn&rsquo;t hard to make out the insincerity in the way she laughed. &ldquo;You just reminded me of someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boyfriend?&rdquo; The look of disappointment on the man&rsquo;s face got Y/N beaming again. She shook her head and told him it was <i>a</i> <i>boy</i>, but definitely not <i>a</i> <i>friend</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;An acquaintance,&rdquo; she clarified, nodding her head, almost as if she was telling herself. The answer made Isaac seem elated.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t explain those feelings to himself, because it was impossible to fall for someone so fast, yet there he was, wearing his heart on his sleeves while sitting next to a girl four years younger than him. Most of the words in his head had vaporized. It took him nearly a minute to stop fidgeting and finally ask her, &ldquo;do you want to have lunch with me?&rdquo;</p><p>To his delight, she said <i>yes</i> without a pause.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was Monday morning, and Harry was just about to head out when his best friend rang on his doorbell. It should be out of the ordinary to find Isaac Skies standing in front of his house, holding a bottle of champagne with a gold satin ribbon around its neck, but Harry knew exactly the reason why. In fact, he had expected something a bit more extravagant, but maybe that one bottle would do.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as he stepped aside so Isaac could enter. Maybe he was still a little bit upset, but of course, he could never stay mad at his best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you show up yesterday? The models were so mad and I had to apologize on your behalf,&rdquo; he said, watching Isaac set the sorry gift down on the coffee table. &ldquo;I tried calling you but you had your phone turned off. You didn&rsquo;t come home last night and your manager didn&rsquo;t know where you were!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Relax. I was with a girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry leaned a shoulder against the wall, slowly shaking his head at the answer he wasn&rsquo;t so surprised to hear. &ldquo;You bailed on me because you were horny?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you dick. It&rsquo;s not like that.&rdquo; Isaac crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling, lips curved into a smile. Harry had known him for almost six years, so he knew that his best friend didn&rsquo;t get excited for just <i>anything</i>. The last time Isaac smiled that big, he got a shooting contract with one of the biggest fashion magazines in London. So the girl, whoever she was, must&rsquo;ve been very <i>special</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; The photographer sucked in a breath. &ldquo;About the favor I asked you for my exhibition.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you mean, hooking you up with some pretty models so you could blow them off like you did yesterday?&rdquo; Harry rolled his eyes. The sarcasm made his best friend chortle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t need your help anymore,&rdquo; Isaac said. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve found my muse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You slept with some girl <i>one</i> night and now she&rsquo;s <i>your muse</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a dick, Styles. It&rsquo;s not like that. I really like this girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your &rsquo;<i>muse</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo; Harry did an air quote to make fun of the way his friend had referred to a girl he barely knew. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac never got a chance to answer that question, because as soon as he opened his mouth, the notification alerts on their phones grabbed their attention immediately. Both had just received a text from a mutual friend that linked to the same online article. The atmosphere in the room weighted down at once as they both stared at the screens in complete shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you know about this?&rdquo; Isaac was the first to break the silence, but he only to received a simple &rsquo;<i>no</i>&rsquo; from Harry. That question was actually pointless. Had Harry already known, he wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting there like a statue. At first, he could not believe in his own eyes, so he had to go over that article several times to check if it was real; and unfortunately, it was.</p><p><b>ACTRESS </b><b><i>RUBY ELLIS</i></b><b> IS OFFICIALLY ENGAGED!</b></p><p><i>After taking nearly </i><b><i>4 months</i></b><i> off social media, American actress </i><b><i>Ruby Ellis </i></b><i>made a SHOCKING</i><b><i> </i></b><i>return with an </i><b><i>Instagram</i></b><i> post showing her </i><b><i>shiny diamond ring</i></b><i>, and </i><b><i>&ldquo;I said yes!!!&rdquo; </i></b><i>was the caption.</i></p><p><i>Though most fans were happy and excited for the actress, her big announcement has definitely broken lots of hearts, especially for the fans who fell in love with Ellis in her latest film </i><b><i>&ldquo;My Dear Assistant&rdquo;</i></b><i>. Many had been waiting for the actress to confirm her &ldquo;secret relationship&rdquo; with younger co-star </i><b><i>Harry Styles</i></b><i>. However, with that Instagram post, there&rsquo;s no doubt that Ellis is still very in love and happier than ever with </i><b><i>her fianc&eacute;</i></b><i>, 30-year-old actor</i><b><i> James Clark</i></b><i>.</i></p><p>&ldquo;When was the last time you talked to Ruby?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shifted his eyes away from the screen as he heard his best friend&rsquo;s question. He quickly turned off his phone and shoved it back into his pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;Probably a couple months ago&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He shook his head, eyes squeezed shut. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not worth your time, mate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>If Harry had known loving that woman was a waste of time, then that news shouldn&rsquo;t have broken his heart. He knew she&rsquo;d been seeing someone, but he had never expected to find out about their engagement through an online article, just like everyone else. It was heartbreaking how one minute you were everything to someone, and the next you knew as much about them as a stranger on the street.</p><p>Speaking of familiar strangers, he suddenly remembered that he had somewhere else to be.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Isaac asked when Harry came to get his coat on the back of a chair.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to go see someone. Have you got the keys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lock the door on the way out, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac nodded, looking totally perplexed, yet the second he meant to ask, Harry already threw on his coat and walked out the door.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Y/N said those words to Harry at his house yesterday, she believed that would be the last time she saw him. She believed he would leave her alone, like he had many times ago, because that was what most of the people in her life had done. But now, he was standing right outside her door, and before she could say a word, he cut her off and went straight to the point.</p><p>&ldquo;I called your father last night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He told me everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything?&rdquo; She cracked a smile, but it was obvious that she didn&rsquo;t actually think it was funny. &ldquo;Did he tell you about the wedding?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo; Harry nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Did he tell you the woman he was gonna marry was just a few years older than you?&rdquo; Judging from the look on his face, she knew her dad hadn&rsquo;t mentioned it. &ldquo;Did he also tell you that he started seeing her <i>a month</i> after my mother&rsquo;s funeral? That on the night of the accident, there&rsquo;d been a fight and my mother had to leave the house? Did he tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N had never told anyone about that tragical night, not even Celine and Amala; and she let people freely make assumptions about her mother&rsquo;s death. They could believe whatever they wanted to believe, but Y/N knew what really happened, or at least she thought she did.</p><p>On the night of the accident, her parents were fighting like they always had. Eighteen-year-old Y/N must rehearse her speech for the graduation in the morning, so she came downstairs and asked them to lower their voices. But as the girl entered the kitchen, she only saw her dad standing with his head hung low, palms laid flat on the marble surface of the kitchen counter. He told her not to worry, because her mother had gone out to buy her a celebration cake. She could still remember how happy she was when she heard it. She believed him, and went back to her room. Just a couple hours later, the police arrived. Y/N rushed downstairs when she saw the blue and red lights from her bedroom window, just in time to find out there had been an accident.</p><p>Her graduation day was the day her whole world fell apart. She stepped onto the big stage, trembling hands holding the speech she had practiced so many times and remembered every single word by heart. While everyone else was applauding for her motivational words, she was faking smiles, trying to hold back her tears as she looked at the two empty seats in the audience. Y/N broke down the second she stepped down from the stage, and had to be escorted out of the ceremony. Not long after that, the hospital officially announced her mother&rsquo;s death, and on the day that was supposed to be the beginning of a new chapter in her life, she felt like it was the end to everything. So she blamed herself, had it not been for that <i>stupid</i> celebration cake, maybe her mum would never have left the house, and the accident would never have happened.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t her fault. It had <i>never</i> been. She hated how her father had let her believe that she was partly responsible for her mother&rsquo;s death. He could&rsquo;ve told her the truth, that her mother left the house to get away from a terrible fight, there was never a cake. If she&rsquo;d known that, maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t have spent the last two years tormenting herself.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Harry broke the silence that followed after Y/N&rsquo;s story. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was all he could say.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t know. Even my friends don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>The fact that she no longer considered him as her friend made his heart ache, yet he couldn&rsquo;t blame her. He had missed out six years of her life, no friend would do something like that.</p><p>&ldquo;I think they were fighting because my mum found out about the other woman&hellip;&rdquo; She shook her head, eyes glued to her feet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m afraid to ask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you find out about everything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That woman said it herself.&rdquo; Y/N scoffed. &ldquo;She called to tell me about the engagement, then by accident mentioned my parents&rsquo; fight that night, thinking I&rsquo;d already known.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry had no idea what to say next. He had no idea what to do next either. Maybe he should just leave, but that wasn&rsquo;t what he wanted. He wanted to hold her and tell her he would be there through everything, even if she might not believe him after he&rsquo;d failed to keep that promise <i>twice</i>. There were so many plot holes in their story and he didn&rsquo;t know where to begin mending it. He didn&rsquo;t want to stay away and let her do whatever she wanted with her life, because after all, she was still a special part of his childhood, a special part of <i>him</i>. However, she might not want him back into her life, and he would completely understand if she asked him to leave.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Those two words weren&rsquo;t what Harry had expected from her. Now he felt like such an asshole, because he&rsquo;d asked for her address from her father to come and apologize, but she ended up saying it first.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for my attitude yesterday. I was upset about my dad, and his fianc&eacute;, it wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo; Her lips twitched, trying to form a smile, but it was no different from a frown. &ldquo;Thank you for looking after me, but you really shouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p><p>Just like that, she turned to go back inside, about to leave him hanging like she had yesterday, but he couldn&rsquo;t let her walk away from another unfinished conversation. Harry held onto her wrist and pulled her into his arms, risking her pushing him away or even hitting him for touching her without her permission. But she didn&rsquo;t do either of them. She let him hold her.</p><p>Y/N just stood still with her arms glued to her sides and her face against his chest. It took her a moment to finally relax in his embrace, closing her eyes and melting into the warmth of his body. That hug felt different than the one they&rsquo;d shared in the treehouse two years ago, probably because her feelings for him weren&rsquo;t the same.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for everything.&rdquo; He tilted his head down to whisper into her ear. &ldquo;For leaving, for not coming back like I&rsquo;d promised, for the fucked up thing I did before I left again for the second time, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>He would&rsquo;ve gone on forever had she not pulled away and interrupted him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not bring up the past, okay?&rdquo;</p><p><i>The past</i>, she meant <i>the kiss, </i>and <i>everything</i> that followed. She&rsquo;d tried to figure it out, to <i>guess</i> what was on his mind when he leaned in and kissed her and she kissed him back. However, she gave up when she realized it didn&rsquo;t have to mean anything. She blamed it on the mixed up emotions, on the spur of the moment, on the pain in her heart for the loss of her mother. And as for him, he must have been just as confused.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t want to know about the woman that had answered the phone, or why he&rsquo;d never called her back, not even once in the last two years. None of that mattered anymore. She&rsquo;d promised herself to give up on him, and she had. There was really no point in asking him to make up a reason or an excuse for what could no longer be changed.</p><p>&ldquo;I talked to <i>someone</i> last night, and that person told me that I needed people in my life. Everyone does.&rdquo; Her lips curved into a small smile, a real one this time. &ldquo;And&hellip;I thought to myself that if I saw you again, I would apologize&hellip;and if you ever&hellip;.want to start over, we can work on that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She&rsquo;d heard him well, she just didn&rsquo;t believe it.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to start over,&rdquo; he repeated himself, more assertive this time as he smiled back at her. &ldquo;I also spent last night thinking about that.&rdquo;</p><p>It was actually the first time in six long years Harry had seen a real smile on his Bambi&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you. I&rsquo;m Y/N,&rdquo; she said with a serious look, which made him laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m Harry,&rdquo; he played along, shaking her hand. &ldquo;Nice to meet you, <i>Bambi</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N invited Harry into her flat. It was small and messy as always, but now that he was already outside her door, she couldn&rsquo;t just ask him to leave. She made him a cup of tea and they sat on the couch, finally opening up to each other for the first time in six years. Of course, both left out many details that they weren&rsquo;t ready to confide just yet, but it was quite a good start. From morning, to noon, and to night, Harry didn&rsquo;t have to think about his ex-lover&rsquo;s engagement, and Y/N had temporarily forgot about her father&rsquo;s. In that small flat, with their phones turned off, completely disconnected with the world, his arm around her shoulders, her head on his chest, it almost felt like they were the same kids they used to be.</p><p>&ldquo;So you study Creative Writing at university?&rdquo;</p><p>The girl nodded as she tossed a gummy bear into her mouth, looking up to meet his eyes. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a terrible writer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remember those stories I wrote in the pink notebook that I used to read to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, those were the best.&rdquo; Harry shook with laughter. &ldquo;I personally loved the chapter about us being secret agents, and shooting laze out of our eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nooooo!&rdquo; Y/N propped herself up to cover Harry&rsquo;s mouth, but he was quick to grab both of her wrists so she couldn&rsquo;t touch him. They were laughing so hard that they almost roll onto the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she trailed off, poking the dimple on his cheek. The girl was practically sitting on his lap now, but they had gotten too comfortable to even care. &ldquo;My writing had never got better than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it supposed to be a bad thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; She chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never gonna write a book that sells.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said the same thing about me being an actor, but look where I am now.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N raised a smile, pushing herself up so her face was at the same level as his. In that moment he stared at her lips, and the way they tasted was still etched on his mind. When she whispered to him, her voice was as warm as the color of her eyes, and he nearly melted all at once into the touch of her hands on his heaving chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you too, Bambi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Y/N batted her eyelashes, looking surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;For still being you, and not giving up.&rdquo;</p><p>It was incredible how fast a moment could change. One second they were dying of laughter and the next, right now, they were just sitting in silence and holding each other&rsquo;s gaze. Having known each other since they were children, but never had they ever got to experience a feeling like this. All of a sudden, everything felt new, and strange, and different,<i> </i>in a <i>good</i> way. Harry parted his lips, about to make a sound, but he forgot what he wanted to say when Y/N pulled away to pick up her phone from the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; She shouted at the time and plunged right out of the sofa, running straight into her room. Harry wasn&rsquo;t used to hearing his little Bambi curse, so the man couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at the word she&rsquo;d just cried out as he asked her what the problem was.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a date in fifteen minutes!&rdquo;</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t the answer he had expected. Harry thought he knew mostly everything about her from all of those stories she&rsquo;d told him from morning till sunset, but somehow she still forgot to mention she had <i>a date</i> that night. He assumed she had forgotten, because she was now frantically running around to find her other shoe.</p><p>&ldquo;Will I get to meet this guy?&rdquo; He shouted out the question when she was in her bedroom changing her clothes.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she shouted back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like him a lot. He&rsquo;s a very nice guy.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t know how <i>nice</i> the mystery man was, but he knew he didn&rsquo;t feel too good about her going on a date. He thought it might have something to do with him knowing her since she was nine, and leaving when she was only fourteen. In his mind, she was still that innocent little girl. It was weird enough to hear her curse, now she was getting ready to go on <i>a date? </i>There was an unsettling feeling inside of him that he couldn&rsquo;t explain.</p><p>A moment later, Y/N emerged from her room, wearing a black bodycon dress which was so short that Harry nearly choked on the gummy bears in his mouth. She spun around and asked him how she looked, and he didn&rsquo;t know what she expected as an answer from him.</p><p>The dress itself, with a plunging neckline and double criss cross straps at the open back, was bound to turn heads already. Now it was on her <i>grown woman body. </i>Harry felt like a pervert for even looking at her from afar. She was beautiful, of course she was, but that was the most skin she&rsquo;d shown since they met again. So a part of him got protective as he asked her if she had a less revealing dress to wear on the first date.</p><p>&ldquo;But I like this one.&rdquo; She laughed as he took a quick glance at her and turned away immediately. &ldquo;H, what are you doing? Look at me as we speak! I&rsquo;m not naked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But someone could look at you right now and imagine that you are!&rdquo; Why did he say that? Now she would think he was imagining her without clothes on. And admittedly, he was trying hard not to. He felt so ashamed for even letting that image cross his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, please tell me you&rsquo;ll wear a coat to cover yourself up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t own a coat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you wear in the winter then?&rdquo; He asked, making her snort. She didn&rsquo;t say anything and just took her purse, telling him to come with her because her date was already waiting outside in his car.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, wait!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry jumped away from the sofa to grab his coat on the hanger by the door and threw it over her shoulders. Y/N refused to put it on, telling him how ridiculous he was, but then she ended up wearing it anyway. He would probably never have let her walk out without the protection of that coat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fourteen years old anymore,&rdquo; she told him with a smile.</p><p>Of course he knew she wasn&rsquo;t fourteen anymore. That fact had been bothering him since he first saw her in that little black dress.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry held the door open for Y/N to walk out on the street. Despite the girl&rsquo;s obvious excitement, he was extremely worried. She looked left and right, then he watched her eyes light up with a smile as she finally spotted the handsome face waiting for her by his black Range Rover. For a second, Harry thought his eyes had fooled him. People could look alike, but as the man finally approached the two of them, Harry was left in shock for the second time that night.</p><p>&ldquo;Isaac?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two know each other?&rdquo; Y/N broadened her eyes, switching them back and forth between the two men whose mouths were both left wide opened.</p><p>A part of Harry wanted to wrap her up with his coat and pull her back inside immediately, another part of him wanted to hear the story of how something like <i>that</i> could even happen. Out of all the men in London, did it have to be <i>his best friend?</i></p><p><i>Wait a minute&hellip;The girl Isaac slept with last night&hellip;His muse&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Is this the girl?! Is Y/N the girl?&rdquo; He raised his voice causing the other two to jump. Y/N didn&rsquo;t understand what he meant, and Isaac was just as loss as she was. It seemed like Harry was the only one out of the three who had an idea what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she was the girl I told you about. Are you two friends?&rdquo; Isaac raised an eyebrow, but he never received a proper answer.</p><p>As soon as Y/N made an attempt to explain her relationship with Harry, he cut her off by telling his best friend, &ldquo;we need to talk. <i>Now</i>.&rdquo;</p></p>",

The man had become quite picky in choosing models now that he had worked with mostly just celebrities. Most of his clients knew exactly how to pose, how to smile, how to act, how to even <i>fake</i> emotions. This time he wanted something new, <i>authenticity</i>, and to be frank, that almost didn&rsquo;t exist in the entertainment industry. So when he left the house on that Sunday morning, the photographer knew better than to build his hopes up, and the last thing he would expect was to stumble across the person he&rsquo;d been looking for.</p>\n<p>But now it was noon, and he was in the park, doing a spontaneous photoshoot with some girl he&rsquo;d met not so long ago; and honestly, that was by far the best thing that had ever happened to him that week. He didn&rsquo;t tell the girl what those shots were for since he knew she didn&rsquo;t really care. She just wanted someone to talk to, and he was happy to be that person.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pose,&rdquo; Isaac said as he lifted the camera again, but the girl sitting on the park bench seemed even more confused by the instruction. She awkwardly sat with her legs crossed and both hands on her knees, like one would do in a high school class photoshoot.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pose, Y/N.&rdquo; He laughed, making the <i>model</i> roll her eyes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; she said, showing a pucker between her brows. Isaac could already tell she was hot-tempered and impatient by nature, but he actually loved it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know what? Let&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; he suggested, leaving her puzzled. &ldquo;Tell me why you were crying.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
