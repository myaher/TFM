If anything he looked more like a<br />captive. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You killed him!&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>The kid throws himself at Tony once more and tries to stab him through the armor.</p><p>Tony easily takes the knife away and throws it back before wrapping his arms around the child. Peter struggles in his arms and Tony tries to calm him down.</p><p>&ldquo;Easy kid. No one&rsquo;s gonna hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You hurt him! You killed him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he was a bad guy!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re the bad guy! He said so!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony just huffs, but wraps his arm tighter around the kid, mostly to keep the kid from hurting himself from thrashing around. It doesn&rsquo;t take long for the kid to start crying and begging Tony not to hurt him. Not to  take him away again.</p><p>&ldquo;Did this man take you away from your family?&rdquo; When Peter nods, Tony&rsquo;s horrified at the thought of what this child might have endured under this man&rsquo;s<br />care. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s has stopped thrashing around at this point and is just limp in Tony&rsquo;s arms, crying silently. Tony gets a better look at him, seeing the scars, cuts<br />and bruises around his face. He&rsquo;s positive he&rsquo;d find the same injuries all over his body too. </p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t know why, but he has a sudden need to protect this kid. More so th an any of the other kids he saved. He loosens up his arms, but brings Peter<br />in closer to his chest, trying to convey as much comfort and warmth he can through the suit. It&rsquo;d be better for him to hold the kid in his actual arms,<br />but he&rsquo;s still not sure if this is all one elaborate trap. </p><p>&ldquo;Shh, I&rsquo;m gonna take you, but somewhere safe and then we can find your parents, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>At this point Peter has just accepted the fact that this man now had control over him and whether or not what he was saying was true, it didn&rsquo;t matter<br />because Peter was never going to be strong enough to escape from Iron Man&rsquo;s hold, similar to how he couldn&rsquo;t escape from the man who kidnapped him. </p><p>Tony carries Peter in his arms as he flies out of there. He has no idea what he kind of situation he just put himself in with this kid, but the sudden need<br />to take care of this boy washes away any doubts he has. </p>",

Valentine\u2019s Day. Your first Valentine\u2019s Day with a boyfriend to be exact. Peter Parker. Your boyfriend and best friend.</p><!-- more --><hr><p>It was Halloween when he finally asked you out. The way he did it was so cute. You were both at the schools Halloween party. You, Peter, MJ, and Ned dressed up as characters from Star Wars. MJ was Rey, Ned was Darth Vader, Peter was Han and you were Leia.</p><p>You and MJ were talking over by the punch table and you can see Ned and Peter talking across the floor, Ned was pushing Peter over to you guys and when they arrived MJ and Ned ran off leaving you and Peter alone. You both stood there awkwardly until he blurted out \u201cY/N wouldyouwannagooutonadatewithme\u201d he gave you a cheesy smile. You laughed and smiled at him and lightly punched his arm, \u201cI would love to go on a date with you.\u201d</p><hr><p>And here you are 4 months later standing outside the movie theater in 35\u00b0 weather waiting for your boyfriend to show up. It was 7:55 and you told him the movie started at 7:30 but knowing Peter he would always be late, so you purchased movie tickets for the 8:15 showing.</p><p>You rock back-and-forth on your heels trying to keep warm and out of nowhere, it starts to snow it was such a romantic moment you wish you were spending it with someone but you just wait for your boyfriend to show up.</p><p>Staring across the street at a restaurant that was so expensive you see people laughing with their loved one feeding each other the most expensive food in the world and you\u2019re in the cold. you look down the street to your left and you see something zip in between the buildings and it goes right over you and you look up and then a single rose petal falls from the sky and the lands between your feet. You pick it up and examine it you thought it was odd.</p><p>Then you hear a commotion come from the alleyway so you decide to go and investigate. You peak your head into the alleyway and see a person rummaging by the trashcan you hear him talk to himself and the voice sounds familiar, it was your boyfriend Peter.</p><p>\u201cOkay Peter let\u2019s not mess this up,\u201d he says in a whisper. You smile and then go back to standing in front of the theater, \u00a0you feel someone hug you from behind and you start to giggle.</p><p>\u201cWell hello Mr.Parker,\u201d you say turning around giving him a smile. \u201cAnd Hello to you Miss L/N.\u201d He looks down at his feet and sighs. \u201cI guess we missed the movie, sorry about that babe. I just got caught up with Mr. Starks internship thing and-\u201c you pressed your lips lightly against his and whisper against him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay baby. I know you were busy, which is why I got tickets for the next showing.\u201d He smiles at you and then hands you a single rose. You give him a smile and his picks you up and spins you around. He puts you down and kisses your forehead.</p><p>You drag him to the theater door and give the man your tickets. You sit down in the theater and wait for the movie to start. When Harry met Sally. It was your all-time favorite romance movie. Peter had never seen it so you made it your mission to have him watch and since it was Valentine\u2019s Day you thought that it was perfect timing.</p><p>You get up to go get some snacks for the movie and Peter quickly gets up, \u201cI will go get the snacks for my snack.\u201d he smiles at you. You laugh, \u201csmooth, remember; no butter on the popcorn get-\u201c \u201csugar packets instead and red and blue icee. I know babe.\u201d He kisses your hands and you sit down watching him walk out the theater.</p><p>He comes back with popcorn, icees, and candy in hand. He sits next to you handing your portion of the food. You both got settled and the theater went dark.</p><p>During the movie, you kept looking at him seeing if he laughs at the funny parts and he does which makes you fall more in love with him. you lifted the armrest that was separating the two of you and get closer to him. You hold his hand and put your head on his shoulder. He kisses your head and focuses back on the movie.</p><p>Your breathing matches his and then you slowly fall asleep. You wake up when the lights come on.</p><p>\u201cGood morning sleepy head.\u201d He chuckles</p><p>\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIts okay baby. You did look tired tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I looked cute tonight.\u201d \u00a0You say playfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Of course, you looked cute you look gorgeous every time \u00a0I see you.\u201d He smiles cheerfully and then carefully places small kisses on your face. His lips were soft and warm against you.</p><p>He drags you out of the theater and into the crisp New York night.</p><p>You hold his hand to keep warm and you just walk around the city. Window shopping mainly. Then you stop in front of one window. Tiffanys. You never really worn jewelry but looking at them in the window made you think about what they would look like on you.</p><p>He took your hand and you went into the store. \u201cPeter we don&rsquo;t have to go in. We can keep walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Y/N you are gonna try them on because I know that you want to.\u201d</p><p>You follow his lead and you start to look around. You weren\u2019t into the flashy stuff just something simple. You found one necklace that was beautiful. It was a simple silver chain with a small blue heart. You asked the lady behind the counter if you could try it on and she handed it to you. You placed it around your neck and Peter taps you on the shoulder \u201cI think this one might look better on you.\u201d You take the necklace that was in his hand.</p><p>\u201cPete this is the same one I\u2019m wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn the heart over.\u201d</p><p>Engraved on the heart says \u201cI love ya - Pete\u201d</p><p>This was the first time he said it, well technically wrote it for you. You look up at him and hug him very tight and kiss his face. \u201cI love ya too Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait is this why you were running so late tonight?\u201d</p><p>He looks \u00a0around concerned and laughs, \u201cYeah baby this is why I was late.\u201d</p>",

Valentine\u2019s Day. Your first Valentine\u2019s Day with a boyfriend to be exact. Peter Parker. Your boyfriend and best friend.</p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>It was Halloween when he finally asked you out. The way he did it was so cute. You were both at the schools Halloween party. You, Peter, MJ, and Ned dressed up as characters from Star Wars. MJ was Rey, Ned was Darth Vader, Peter was Han and you were Leia.</p><p>You and MJ were talking over by the punch table and you can see Ned and Peter talking across the floor, Ned was pushing Peter over to you guys and when they arrived MJ and Ned ran off leaving you and Peter alone. You both stood there awkwardly until he blurted out \u201cY/N wouldyouwannagooutonadatewithme\u201d he gave you a cheesy smile. You laughed and smiled at him and lightly punched his arm, \u201cI would love to go on a date with you.\u201d</p><hr><p>And here you are 4 months later standing outside the movie theater in 35\u00b0 weather waiting for your boyfriend to show up. It was 7:55 and you told him the movie started at 7:30 but knowing Peter he would always be late, so you purchased movie tickets for the 8:15 showing.</p><p>You rock back-and-forth on your heels trying to keep warm and out of nowhere, it starts to snow it was such a romantic moment you wish you were spending it with someone but you just wait for your boyfriend to show up.</p><p>Staring across the street at a restaurant that was so expensive you see people laughing with their loved one feeding each other the most expensive food in the world and you\u2019re in the cold. you look down the street to your left and you see something zip in between the buildings and it goes right over you and you look up and then a single rose petal falls from the sky and the lands between your feet. You pick it up and examine it you thought it was odd.</p><p>Then you hear a commotion come from the alleyway so you decide to go and investigate. You peak your head into the alleyway and see a person rummaging by the trashcan you hear him talk to himself and the voice sounds familiar, it was your boyfriend Peter.</p><p>\u201cOkay Peter let\u2019s not mess this up,\u201d he says in a whisper. You smile and then go back to standing in front of the theater, \u00a0you feel someone hug you from behind and you start to giggle.</p><p>\u201cWell hello Mr.Parker,\u201d you say turning around giving him a smile. \u201cAnd Hello to you Miss L/N.\u201d He looks down at his feet and sighs. \u201cI guess we missed the movie, sorry about that babe. I just got caught up with Mr. Starks internship thing and-\u201c you pressed your lips lightly against his and whisper against him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay baby. I know you were busy, which is why I got tickets for the next showing.\u201d He smiles at you and then hands you a single rose. You give him a smile and his picks you up and spins you around. He puts you down and kisses your forehead.</p><p>You drag him to the theater door and give the man your tickets. You sit down in the theater and wait for the movie to start. When Harry met Sally. It was your all-time favorite romance movie. Peter had never seen it so you made it your mission to have him watch and since it was Valentine\u2019s Day you thought that it was perfect timing.</p><p>You get up to go get some snacks for the movie and Peter quickly gets up, \u201cI will go get the snacks for my snack.\u201d he smiles at you. You laugh, \u201csmooth, remember; no butter on the popcorn get-\u201c \u201csugar packets instead and red and blue icee. I know babe.\u201d He kisses your hands and you sit down watching him walk out the theater.</p><p>He comes back with popcorn, icees, and candy in hand. He sits next to you handing your portion of the food. You both got settled and the theater went dark.</p><p>During the movie, you kept looking at him seeing if he laughs at the funny parts and he does which makes you fall more in love with him. you lifted the armrest that was separating the two of you and get closer to him. You hold his hand and put your head on his shoulder. He kisses your head and focuses back on the movie.</p><p>Your breathing matches his and then you slowly fall asleep. You wake up when the lights come on.</p><p>\u201cGood morning sleepy head.\u201d He chuckles</p><p>\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIts okay baby. You did look tired tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I looked cute tonight.\u201d \u00a0You say playfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Of course, you looked cute you look gorgeous every time \u00a0I see you.\u201d He smiles cheerfully and then carefully places small kisses on your face. His lips were soft and warm against you.</p><p>He drags you out of the theater and into the crisp New York night.</p><p>You hold his hand to keep warm and you just walk around the city. Window shopping mainly. Then you stop in front of one window. Tiffanys. You never really worn jewelry but looking at them in the window made you think about what they would look like on you.</p><p>He took your hand and you went into the store. \u201cPeter we don\u2019t have to go in. We can keep walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Y/N you are gonna try them on because I know that you want to.\u201d</p><p>You follow his lead and you start to look around. You weren\u2019t into the flashy stuff just something simple. You found one necklace that was beautiful. It was a simple silver chain with a small blue heart. You asked the lady behind the counter if you could try it on and she handed it to you. You placed it around your neck and Peter taps you on the shoulder \u201cI think this one might look better on you.\u201d You take the necklace that was in his hand.</p><p>\u201cPete this is the same one I\u2019m wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn the heart over.\u201d</p><p>Engraved on the heart says \u201cI love ya - Pete\u201d</p><p>This was the first time he said it, well technically wrote it for you. You look up at him and hug him very tight and kiss his face. \u201cI love ya too Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait is this why you were running so late tonight?\u201d</p><p>He looks \u00a0around concerned and laughs, \u201cYeah baby this is why I was late.\u201d</p>",

The correct foods, the time to take naps, and the amount of water to inhale like you were dying of dehydration.\u00a0</p><p>So it didn\u2019t come as a shock to you when the plane landed and majority of your classmates were walking like slugs through the airport in Rome, while you and Peter had a bit of a pep to your step.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when your dad took us to Rome and didn\u2019t tell us why,\u201d Peter spoke quietly, the only two students close to you both being Ned and MJ, who would know of your escapades already.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>You smiled,\u00a0\u201cAnd when we got there he just threw our suits at us and left on the jet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur first mission,\u201d Peter chuckled,\u00a0\u201cAnd your suit malfunctioned and you almost tore me in half.\u201d<br/></p><p>He was laughing now, but at the time it was terrifying, and the Italian mafia ring that had - in the words of your dad been\u00a0\u201chardly any competition\u201d - almost gotten away with it when they\u2019d proved to be a far larger threat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d you shook your head,\u00a0\u201cThat was our sophomore year.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter shrugged,\u00a0\u201cThat was before Thor told me I actually needed to work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could lift school buses but hardly had any muscles,\u201d you noted, pinching his forearm.\u00a0\u201cAnd you pulled your groin muscle getting back on the jet. You were hobbling around for a week!\u201d<br/></p><p>The two of you were laughing now quite obnoxiously, considering everyone else was quite exhausted and just wanted a quiet subway ride to the train station. But, just like old times, you and Peter were relentless.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCare to share with the class?\u201d Harry asked, sliding his sunglasses onto his face as you all followed Mr. Harrington towards the train station.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJust reminiscing about the time Peter sprained his balls,\u201d you smirked, watching as Peter rolled his eyes and slung his arm around your shoulders lazily, leaving you to stagger slightly under his weight.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The scrawny boy had bulked up a bit since &hellip; since the initial event &hellip; and as he pulled his phone from his pocket and seemed to be distracted by the screen, you observed his profile closely.</p><p>\u201cStop staring,\u201d Peter mumbled.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou just look a bit different,\u201d you shrugged, leaning slightly into his arm as he stopped texted May of his whereabouts and slid his phone into his back pocket once more.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah? Maybe I look the same, you just haven\u2019t seen me in a while.\u201d<br/></p><p>The statement was innocent. It was a fact that you\u2019d been taking your summer vacation to yourself, and had opted to finish out the end of your junior year with online courses. So yes, you\u2019d physically been apart.</p><p>But emotionally, you and Peter hadn\u2019t connected in quite some time, and that was something new for the both of you, but only the fault of one of you.</p><p>\u201cYeah well &hellip;\u201d you slinked out from under Peter\u2019s arm, clearing your throat and adjusting your backpack,\u00a0\u201cSome of us process things differently.\u201d<br/></p><p>You tried to pretend you didn\u2019t see the slight pain in Peter\u2019s eyes when you pulled yourself away from him. Just the momentary and innocent touch of his arm around your shoulders made you feel more at ease - even in a train station in Rome - than you had in months.</p><p>But comfort led to complacency, and you felt the need to be more alert and aware.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright well, what fancy hotel am I going to be crashing in for the next week?\u201d Flash called towards Mr. Harrington, who seemed to be completely preoccupied by every map around him that he obviously couldn\u2019t read. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute that you think you\u2019re going to be staying in some fancy digs, there, Eugene,\u201d you stated, watching as Ned snickered slightly and Betty gave you a beaming look. </p><p>You and Betty had never really been friends. She\u2019d asked you countless times if she could interview you for their morning news show and each time you\u2019d declined. You were pretty sure Peter had talked to her about it at one point after you\u2019d ranted to him about \u201cnot having any privacy at this stupid school\u201d because she soon stopped and Peter was suddenly giving a report on the photojournalism work he was doing and how he\u2019d gotten a snap of Spider-Man.</p><p>What a narcissist. </p><p>\u201cI paid to be here,\u201d Flash whined, \u201cJust give me a bed.\u201d</p><p>The bed Flash did end up getting was in a run-down looking hotel where the lobby smelled like corn chips and the man sitting behind the counter looked like he belonged in some sort of episode of <i>The Series of Unfortunate Events.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThis &hellip; is &hellip;?\u201d Harry was at a loss for words as Peter pushed past him politely and set his suitcase down on a table. You watched him hesitantly as he fiddled with the handle and talked under his breath to MJ.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The suitcase was something you\u2019d never seen before. It was quite large, and never was what Peter would take when the two of you traveled for your dad\u2019s trips. He usually brought along a smaller carry on that was definitely Aunt May\u2019s, considering the faded pink flowers and the floral name tag.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d never really said anything about it, and you know your dad had never mentioned it either. But you do know that your dad had bought Peter a whole set of luggage to use. So the fact that he wasn\u2019t using any of it &hellip; you weren\u2019t sure what exactly to say.\u00a0</p><p>But then you noticed the little engraving as Peter continued to fiddle absentmindedly with the handle without even looking as he and MJ continued their conversation.\u00a0</p><p><i>BFP.</i></p><p>Benjamin Franklin Parker.</p><p>You sucked in a breath at the realization that Peter was using his uncle Ben\u2019s old luggage. It made your heart warm and your body fill with little tingles as you noticed he never full let go of his luggage. God, what a goddamn cutie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay class,\u201d Mr. Harrington attempted to cut off the multiple conversations going on all at once, and you simply sat back in your seat next to Harry, who was on his phone, and watched as everyone slowly started to pay attention to your teacher.<br/></p><p>\u201cRoom assignments,\u201d he held up multiple keys,\u00a0\u201cCome and collect your keys and key card with the wifi password and find your roommate.\u201d<br/></p><p>It was like an odd mad dash for everyone to scramble to find the key with their name on it scribbled on the paper with the number. It didn\u2019t take long for you to find yours, or, in your case, for Peter to hand yours to you as he was shuffling through them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s you and me, girl,\u201d MJ said, twiddling her key between her fingers.\u00a0\u201cGotta say, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s you.\u201d<br/></p><p>You simply nodded, unsure what to say in a situation like this. So you decided on,\u00a0\u201cThanks. Me too.\u201d</p><p>The room was small, and Ned and Peter watched from their room on the other side of the hall as you and MJ attempted to get the closet doors open.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d you simply stated, too tired to attempt to try. MJ was already flopped over on the bed, and you both seemed to come to the realization that if you were ever going to open this rusty old closet door (that probably held a body) then you were going to need someone who could lift an entire bus with one hand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter opened it easily, a smirk on his face as MJ flipped him off and you simply shoved him out of the way to toss your things inside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys want to go out and explore? We have the entire afternoon to go out on our own before dinner tonight.\u201d Peter looked amongst the four of you as he awaited a response, obviously not prepared for everyone to want to take a nap once immediately landing in a new and foreign country.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude, we\u2019re jet lagged,\u201d Ned snorted,\u00a0\u201cYou honestly think I want to go out on a tour right now? We\u2019re going out tomorrow.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m good,\u201d MJ yawned,\u00a0\u201cGotta prep for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>You watched as Peter started to deflate, fiddling with the ends of his hoodie strings as he sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not jet lagged.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cRich people,\u201d MJ mumbled, shooting you a playful smirk as you stuck your tongue out at her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you back gelato,\u201d you promised, before grabbing your backpack and following Peter out into the hallway.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You passed Harry in the hallway where he was looking at something on his phone with Flash while you and Peter attempted to make your way by.</p><p>\u201cGuys look at this.\u201d He nearly shoved his phone into your faces as Peter squinted - a lot of light too fast - and you grasped it from him to get a better look.\u00a0<br/></p><p>It was a video going viral on YouTube of some huge sandstorm in what seemed to be Libya.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you asked, squinting slightly as Peter looked over your shoulder as you got a better look at the shaky footage.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a typical sandstorm. It was what seemed to be a giant being? If you could call it that. You felt Peter\u2019s breath on your throat, causing you to grip the phone a bit tighter considering the proximity of which it was bringing Peter closer to you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Buildings were being swept up, cars being flattened, and you didn\u2019t even want to think of what had happened to the people had there been any large masses anywhere close.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSome crazy anomaly in Libya,\u201d Harry said excited,\u00a0\u201cIt straight up looks like a man.\u201d</p><p>You took the liberty of sending the link to the video to your phone, feeling the vibration in your pocket before handing it back to Harry. Flash was silent, as if gauging your reaction to what you\u2019d just seen. It was this freaky next-level bullshit that you knew used to be an Avengers project, but with the way things were now &hellip; no Tony. No Cap. Well &hellip; you weren\u2019t sure what the protocol was.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Peter offered, casually and calmly taking your hand in his as the two of you made your way towards the lobby.\u00a0<br/></p><p>It was a nice sunny day, which you hadn\u2019t had in a while, and so you placed your sunglasses on your head in delight as the two of you decided to make your way towards the nearest cafe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI sent the video to myself,\u201d you told Peter as the two of you sat down and ordered some pizza. Well, you both ordered your own pizzas but you knew Peter would be eating close to both of them, saving you probably two or three slices.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You pulled out your phone and watched as the hologram of the video produced itself between the two of you.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N, we don\u2019t need to watch this,\u201d Peter sighed, nearly inhaling another piece of pizza into his mouth and holding his water glass as if his life depended on it.<br/></p><p>\u201cI caught this though,\u201d you pointed out, zooming in on the video - something you couldn\u2019t have done on Harry\u2019s iPhone, and freezing the video on two figures that had been standing off to the side of the shot. Too small to be seen on any regular viewing - but with some enhancing and fancy Stark tech well &hellip;<br/></p><p>It was obvious to you that Maria Hill and Nick Fury were on the scene.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s S.H.I.E.L.D.,\u201d you motioned to Fury as Peter squinted and turned the screen to get a better view himself.<br/></p><p>\u201cYep. Sure is,\u201d he mumbled, going back to his next slice.\u00a0\u201cGood for them.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to call Happy and ask about this?\u201d you raised an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cNot going to ask me to call either?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N, we\u2019re on vacation,\u201d Peter sighed,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re in Venice. We\u2019re eating pizza. We haven\u2019t hung out in four months. Can\u2019t you just take this time and appreciate it for what it is without having to look outside the situation to find something else?\u201d<br/></p><p>You stared at Peter, simply blinking and wondering what kind of comeback you were going to have.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring the suit,\u201d Peter continued, then winced,\u00a0\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t pack the suit with any thought of being Spider-Man here. May was the one that tucked it in there last minute. Nearly blew my cover through customs.\u201d<br/></p><p>You chuckled at this, knowing the Peter Parker Panic Face all too well.\u00a0</p><p>There was something surreal about being here with Peter and just relaxing. You couldn\u2019t remember the last time you\u2019d felt this at ease. He was looking over across San Marco square and just sipping his water like the pretty boy he was, and you were sitting here not focusing on him and God, that was a crime.</p><p>You turned your phone off and cleared your throat,\u00a0\u201cSo &hellip; you and MJ.\u201d</p><p>Peter choked on his water, doubling over slightly as he wiped his mouth on his flannel and looked over at you questionably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou and Michelle Jones,\u201d you smirked,\u00a0\u201cI can see it. I\u2019ll have to gossip with Ned later. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s head of the fan club.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo - Y/N, no. That\u2019s not -\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d you shrugged, cutting him off because really, you did not want to hear the explanation.\u00a0\u201cYou two have always been close. You both went through a lot together, so I can understand the connection.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter scoffed and leaned back in his chair,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together and we aren\u2019t going to date.\u201d</p><p>You broke your straw just like that, one flick of your fingers and it snapped as Peter stared at you with wide eyes.\u00a0\u201cYou okay?\u201d he chuckled.</p><p><i>No I\u2019m not fucking okay. Love me!</i> you screamed, internally, where your broken and selfish heart was having a bitch-fit to break free from the cage you\u2019d put around it. Your heart just couldn\u2019t stay in its fucking lane.</p><p>You composed yourself and shrugged,\u00a0\u201cWhy are you suddenly lying to me? Just be honest. Do you have feelings for MJ?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated and it was then that you knew you were toast. You were the butt end of a loaf of bread that got stuck in the toaster after being put off for days because no one really wanted you, but you were the only option left.\u00a0</p><p>But Peter wasn\u2019t yours. Peter may have been yours at one point when the two of you were thick as thieves, running around the compound and attempting to make your dad laugh whenever you tried out new gadgets and blasted the Inspector Gadget theme song hopped up on energy drinks.\u00a0</p><p>He was yours when you\u2019d lay awake at night talking about things that had always bothered the two of you about growing up so young in an atmosphere the Avengers had pulled you into.</p><p>He\u2019d been yours every time he smiled in your direction at school or slid into the bench at lunch next to you, or cheered whenever Happy would allow either of you to drive the fancy car that would pick you up from school.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d been yours for a night once. But the thought had your whole body seemingly bursting into flames and aching as if being probed intensely under the brightest and harshest of lights.\u00a0</p><p>But now, sitting across from him in Venice where your toes were touching and Peter was looking like sunshine behind his sunglasses, and you were sitting in your favorite cardigan with one and a half pizzas eaten between you &hellip; you knew Peter wasn\u2019t yours anymore.</p><p>Four months was a long time. One sunny day in Venice couldn\u2019t change anything.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone through a lot,\u201d Peter sighed, pulling you back into the conversation.\u00a0\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve all been through a lot. But uh &hellip;\u201d Peter sighed and ruffled his hair,\u00a0\u201cShe took it like a champ. The therapy, the new job &hellip; she had Mr. Delmar smiling every day when she\u2019d arrive for work, you know? And she\u2019s always been proud and confident, but she\u2019s been more caring and aware of the student body since everything has happened and honestly? I\u2019ve been impressed.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter shrugged, as if his declaration would mean anything less.\u00a0</p><p>A breeze washed over the two of you and you caught a whiff of his scent - the mix of cologne and boyish charm you\u2019ve always associated with Peter since you\u2019d met him.</p><p>You wondered sometimes what your smell was like to him. Well, you at least tried not to think about that anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go for it?\u201d you encouraged.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You weren\u2019t a <i>bitch</i>. Well, okay yeah you <i>definitely</i> were a bitch. But you\u2019d never been a bitch by default. That was a hard exterior you\u2019d built up over the years prior to meeting Peter, and since he\u2019d come into your life like the who goddamn sun that he was - not even just a ray of sunshine - he had been slowly chipping away at that persona to find the happy sunshine girl underneath that you\u2019d always been.\u00a0</p><p>But you were never and will never be a bitch to your friends - especially Peter. And if helping Peter find someone that would take care of him and be there for him and take the time to understand him &hellip; then fuck it, you were Team MJ more than even Ned Leeds probably was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend, Y/N, I can\u2019t just &hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cShe likes you,\u201d you scoffed, rolling your eyes and shoving your sunglasses down your face so you could look Peter more aggressively in the eyes.\u00a0\u201cI know I\u2019ve been gone for a while, but that girl has liked you for ages, and she seems to be smitten with you now more than ever.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter\u2019s blushing, and you would continue to push him until he\u2019d just admit his feelings, if you didn\u2019t see some of your school group over his shoulder making their way towards you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell well well,\u201d you chuckled, sitting up straighter and shoving your glasses back on your face as the MJ in question plopped down next to Peter and grabbed his water glass from him, chugging it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You smirked as Peter looked at her obviously in shock, and she seemed to not be in the mood to look his way.\u00a0\u201cTired,\u201d she grumbled, reaching over for a slice of pizza still left.</p><p>\u201cThose beds are not &hellip; comfortable,\u201d Ned grumbled,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how Betty is still sleeping.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou just miss your super nice therapeutic mattress,\u201d you joked,\u00a0\u201cYou still have that right? Storm Trooper sheets and all?\u201d<br/></p><p>Ned laughed and swatted at your arm lazily, sitting back in his chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it like being back in the land of the living?\u201d Harry asked you, sitting down on your other side and wrapping his arm around the back of your seat.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Harry was a nice kid. Harry could be fun. Harry would make for a great distraction for the whole Peter and MJ thing that you were sure was happening. So you leaned into his touch.</p><p>Sighing, you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cMuch more lively than throwing darts and shooting guns at targets all day with Nat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that you casually name drop the Black Widow,\u201d Harry snorted and shook his head,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, girl.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell she has been hanging out with Black Widow,\u201d MJ pointed out, smirking towards you with a flicker of admiration.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Girls were so fucking petty. You knew you got lucky when you realized the only person who you may ever have to compete for attention from Peter was MJ. She was so chill and like a goddamn queen with her intellect, looks, and wit. Hell, you always told yourself that if Peter and MJ did end up together, at least you\u2019d know you\u2019d have a super cool friend for life along with Peter.</p><p>So why it was irking you so much that Peter was staring at MJ\u2019s profile - moments after you\u2019d suggested he just go for it\u00a0 - well &hellip; girls are petty.\u00a0</p><p>When dinner came, you were all herded towards an older restaurant that you were pretty sure you were only going to because Mr. Harrington had read five thousand reviews on Yelp. He kept using words you were sure he wasn\u2019t familiar with when it came to the culinary craft, and it seemed he was the only one excited.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to eat my weight in pasta,\u201d Flash smoothed out his blazer as you patted his shoulder. You weren\u2019t sure when it started, considering you\u2019d only really been back with these kids for about a day and a half, but Flash was suddenly hovering around you in an oddly protective manner.<br/></p><p>Considering the kind words he\u2019d shared with you at the airport, and then the fact that he\u2019d been quiet and respectful whenever you\u2019d talked since, made you wonder if maybe Flash really was trying to be a better person instead of the attention-seeking prideful bully you\u2019d known him to be in the past.\u00a0</p><p>But then he shoved Peter as you were all walking into the restaurant and you couldn\u2019t help but want to shove him into the Venice canals and run him over with a gondola.\u00a0</p><p>The meal was just fine, considering everyone was starving and the jet lag was starting to kick in so everyone was rowdy. You\u2019d never been abroad with a group of students before, only ever with your dad, and the closest you\u2019d ever come to a European vacation was when you and Peter finished your mission in Rome by highjacking the jet that was sent for you and spending a long weekend in Monte Carlo.\u00a0</p><p>You shuddered just thinking about it.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone was lagging by the time Mr. Harrington started to drag you all to the cinema to watch some Italian film based off a book you were all supposed to read. The only one to actually read it was MJ, and even she didn\u2019t want to see the film, but &hellip; that\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter cleared his throat and placed his hands together, pointing at you with both his hands. It made you smile, because it was something your dad used to do and a bit of a joke that you and Peter had picked up to mess with him. And now seeing Peter do it gave you this odd feeling of home, mixed with a bit of guilt and regret &hellip; but mostly home.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay indeed,\u201d you nodded, sauntering along with MJ, Ned, and Betty in the back of the group as everyone followed a very confused teacher who was bad at maps.<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s place bets. Who are we thinking tonight?\u201d MJ asked, skipping from one stone to the next with calculated precision and balance.\u00a0\u201cObviously I want to put ten on Bets and Nedd-o.\u201d<br/></p><p>Ned rolled his eyes,\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019re a couple! You can\u2019t place bets on us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d Betty looked around, obviously confused considering the conversation was completely and ridiculously immature, but tradition.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhenever we watch films in school the four of us would usually place bets on who would get with who -\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhom,\u201d you corrected Peter. He rolled his eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh who would get with whom,\u201d he shot you a look,\u00a0\u201cwhile the lights were out. And considering Mr. Harrington has us watch a lot of films, the four of us have made some good money over the years.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou and Stevie Preston got me fifty bucks,\u201d you told Betty.<br/></p><p>\u201cI still have no idea how you got that one,\u201d MJ groaned,\u00a0\u201cWhy did you cuddle with Stevie anyway? His posture is atrocious and he\u2019s always talking about his bug collection.\u201d<br/></p><p>Betty looked confused,\u00a0\u201cWell, that day specifically he was wearing this jacket that smelled really nice like lavender, and that\u2019s my favorite smell and he told me he liked my new green brooch so &hellip; I don\u2019t know. I was feeling sentimental,\u201d Betty shrugged.\u00a0\u201cObviously a one time thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Peter grumbled,\u00a0\u201cYou and Stevie Preston cost me fifty bucks.\u201d</p><p>You patted Peter\u2019s cheek happily before laughing.\u00a0\u201cIt was simple, really,\u201d you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI manufactured the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d MJ shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo really,\u201d you smiled,\u00a0\u201cI knew Betty liked the smell of lavender considering the hand lotion you always use after gym class before we went to lunch. And Stevie is always one for getting cold - he never wears a jacket - and that morning when I noticed he was chilly, I handed over one of Peter\u2019s old hoodies he\u2019d left at my place ages ago that I\u2019d put lavender perfume on. Then, I noticed the pride you had in your new brooch, Bets, so I simply commented on it in the presence of Stevie, who obviously had a crush on you, and mentioned how people don\u2019t notice nice things like that anymore and girls like when guys notice those things. So &hellip; Stevie comments on your brooch and smells like lavender and BOOM I manufactured love.\u201d<br/></p><p>No one said anything as you continued to walk, but all of them clearly looked dumbstruck. There was a mix of fear and awe in Peter\u2019s eyes, which turned into pride as he broke out into a smile.\u00a0\u201cAnd then you out of the blue bet me fifty knowing that it would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also knew you had fifty because my dad paid you the day before and I knew I wanted to go to that thai place for dinner and I could get you to go if I had the money to do so. Which, prior to our bet, I did not.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou two are seriously twisted,\u201d Ned shook his head,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like you feed off one another. I bet your murders take half the time to plan when you decide to go in on it together.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes as Peter laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll bet Jon and Samantha will at least make out once,\u201d MJ cleared her throat,\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ve been secretly hooking up all summer.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d Peter asked, twisting his body slightly to look back at where MJ was trailing behind him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause they never stand farther than arm\u2019s length apart. That means at least something,\u201d MJ rolled her eyes.<br/></p><p>You watched as Peter\u2019s eyes traveled from his arm to yours, noticing the short distance between the two of you before he attempted to hesitantly shift away a bit farther.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell how much and against whom are you betting then?\u201d you asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say a solid fifteen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWeak.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLogical,\u201d MJ countered.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso weak,\u201d you snickered.<br/></p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Peter laughed, pushing you slightly as you bat childishly at his hand.<br/></p><p>\u201cGod stop flirting and just make out in a closet somewhere already,\u201d Ned joked. Three separate interactions took place where you shot Ned a look, Peter immediately looked away from you while blushing, and MJ went a bit rigid, looking down at her feet.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a bet,\u201d you said, turning and walking backwards so you could get a good look at everyone\u2019s faces.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer allowed,\u201d MJ stuck her tongue out at you, the prior Ned comment having passed within the length of five paces.\u00a0\u201cYou manufacture love. That\u2019s cheating.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t have anything on me now to do so, now do I?\u201d you asked, opening your arms as if to prove a point.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Peter cocked his head slightly, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had a lot of points, but she\u2019s still a cheater,\u201d MJ shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m vetoing your bet.\u201d<br/></p><p>You huffed,\u00a0\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll place one,\u201d Betty spoke up, a bit timid.\u00a0</p><p>Betty was a smart girl, there was no denying that. Her drive and spunk gave her an upper hand on majority of the school. She was going to be an ace reporter one day, that was for sure, but in the midst of three geniuses - you, Peter and MJ - well, anyone would be a bit timid when trying to impress your boyfriend\u2019s best friends.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you cheered,\u00a0\u201cNow this is getting interesting! Place your bets, Bets.\u201d<br/></p><p>A bit of a pink blush tinted Betty\u2019s cheeks as she spoke,\u00a0\u201cI bet twenty euros that Flash will try to make out with Y/N during the film.\u201d</p><p>Oxygen seemed to funnel from the group as everyone remained silent long enough for their shock to cling to every fiber of their bones. No one had bet on you before, minus the first three times that Ned had bet MJ that you and Peter would lean in and cuddle at some point.\u00a0</p><p>But that was a given, and Ned and MJ had quickly grown tired of losing their money to one another.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFlash?\u201d you stumbled slightly from walking backwards and Peter was quick to catch you, straightening you out as you cleared your throat.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s some big talk there Bets.\u201d<br/></p><p>Betty shrugged,\u00a0\u201cEveryone can see he\u2019s been trying to make a move since you got back. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he and Harry are secretly fighting over you. Flash has always had something for you, we all know it, and if Harry give you one more look while you\u2019re not looking at him then he might die right then and there.\u201d</p><p>You were blushing now, feeling a deep warmth splinter through your entire body.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d was all you said before turning back around and swiftly doing your best to keep up with the group.<br/></p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d Betty asked, watching your retreating figure as Peter nibbled on his bottom lip. Betty wasn\u2019t the only one that had noticed Flash\u2019s interest in you, or the way Harry\u2019s stare had lingered everywhere you go since you\u2019d returned to the living. It had made his skin crawl with an uncomfortable feeling settling in the tips of his fingers that itched to grasp you as tight as he could and hide you away from prying eyes.<br/></p><p>But that wasn\u2019t his job.</p><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t,\u201d MJ said, coming up a bit closer so her shoulder brushed against Peter\u2019s as they walked,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s just a bit sensitive to &hellip; relationships, I think. It\u2019s never really been her thing.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cRelationships?\u201d Betty furrowed her eyebrows, obviously confused.</p><p>\u201cEmotional commitment,\u201d MJ corrected.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I wonder why,\u201d Peter mumbled, more to himself, but MJ looked to him and he could tell she was struggling to figure out a way to explain you to others that wouldn\u2019t sound like she was judging. MJ meant well, and Peter appreciated that.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll take that bet, baby,\u201d Ned said, grasping Betty\u2019s hand and squeezing it tight. Betty smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>As everyone filed into the cinema, you plopped down in the middle, ready for Peter to find a seat next to you and allow you to toss your legs across his lap. But instead, Flash - speak of the devil - sat down next to you and adjusted himself so he was more lounging than sitting.</p><p>\u201cYou read this?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d you rolled your eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah you did.\u201d<br/></p><p>Flash looked at you as you let out a long huff through your nose, turning and facing him, locking eyes in a challenging way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Fine</i>. Maybe I did.\u201d<br/></p><p>Flash smiled.\u00a0\u201cSee, you can pretend you don\u2019t care about all this literature and history and art. You\u2019re a science kid through and through - I get that. But you also aced all our art history tests last spring term, and you even won our history essay contest. This shit excites you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018<i>This shit</i>,\u2019\u201d you snorted,\u00a0\u201cNice.\u201d<br/></p><p>Betty and Ned settled down in front of you, Betty looking over her shoulder to give you a quick, bold suggestive look. You smirked. Leaning forward, you placed your head between Ned and Betty, clearing your throat for attention.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will bet you both fifty bucks that by the end of tonight, Peter and MJ will make out.\u201d<br/></p><p>Ned nearly spit out all his water as Betty gasped so loudly that everyone turned to see if she was alright. You locked eyes with Peter, from where he and MJ were sitting a bit off to the side, two rows in front of Ned and Betty. You winked at him and made a little kissy face before turning your attention back to Betty and Ned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you accept my bet?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Hell yeah</i> I accept your bet,\u201d Ned laughed, turning to face you,\u00a0\u201cI would love fifty bucks.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re about to lose it, so cherish it now,\u201d you winked before sitting back in your seat.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Flash asked, tossing some popcorn in his mouth. You leaned over and helped yourself, chewing slowly as you thought.<br/></p><p>\u201cI just bet Betty and Ned each fifty bucks that Peter and MJ would be making out by the end of tonight.\u201d<br/></p><p>Flash stared at you, a bit dumbfounded, as he finally broke out into a low chuckle.\u00a0\u201cYeah right. You\u2019d sell all your secrets to the media before allowing MJ to kiss your man.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Turning to look at Flash, you could tell in his smug expression that the rise he\u2019d gotten out of you was exactly what he was hoping for.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, <i>come on</i> Y/N,\u201d Flash chuckled and turned to face you a bit more as the lights dimmed for the film.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t honestly expect me to have been in the same classroom as you and Dr. Prodigy over there for the past four years and not see clear as day that you are <i>obviously</i> in love with him.\u201d<br/></p><p>You blinked, giving yourself some time to process this, as you reached out and grabbed some more popcorn.\u00a0\u201cStupid,\u201d was the only remark you could think to utter.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I was there when you found out that Peter had &hellip;\u201d Flash trailed off and cleared his throat,\u00a0\u201cYou <i>punched</i> a security guard right in the <i>face</i>.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe lost a lot of people. I thought my dad had also died then,\u201d you recalled.</p><p>Flash rolled his eyes and adjusted the popcorn on his lap so it was more centered towards you, the one who was obviously going to be eating more of it.\u00a0\u201cYou can say whatever you want, Y/N, but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are stupid.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not <i>that</i> stupid,\u201d Flash quipped back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to love him, you know. Like, he\u2019s a nerd and a <i>total loser</i> but I bet you guys have a lot of fun with the internship. Having access to that kind of tech &hellip; I mean, hell yeah I can see where the whole friends to lovers situation blossomed in your little stone cold heart.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in denial,\u201d Flash shrugged.<br/></p><p>\u201cI want Peter to be happy,\u201d you hissed, attempting to not take away from the film.\u00a0\u201cAnd MJ makes him happy.\u201d<br/></p><p>Flash shrugged,\u00a0\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attempting to speak it into existence, <i>sure</i>.\u201d<br/></p><p>Flash was sitting there smug, watching the film and sighing,\u00a0\u201cThese subtitles are wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Italian.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes actually, I <i>do</i> speak Italian.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou speak Italian?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Oh my God</i> are you deaf?\u201d<br/></p><p>You and Flash looked at one another for a moment as he smirked, his eyes twinkling as he was obviously enjoying this conversation. You couldn\u2019t believe that resident idiot Flash Thompson was actually &hellip; observant &hellip; and smart?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d you laughed lightly, shaking your head and sinking down in your seat to be on Flash\u2019s level.</p><p>\u201cNumber one bully, you know that,\u201d Flash shrugged.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh my God. Are you one of those angsty art kids that is super good at science and maths but secretly wants to be the next Vincent van Gogh?\u201d<br/></p><p>Flash rolled his eyes,\u00a0\u201cI only know you aced all your art history exams because you\u2019re the only one that got higher marks than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Holy shit</i>.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Flash nodded.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You actually watched the rest of the film. And considering you had read the book, listening to the Italian and enjoying the subtitles and plot twists was more thrilling considering you had a familiarity for the story. And, somehow without your knowledge, you\u2019d slowly found yourself leaning against Flash as the two of you shared the rest of his popcorn.\u00a0</p><p>His arm was warm, and the kind of arm that was comfortable to lean your head on instead of the back of the cinema seats.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d you learn Italian?\u201d you asked at some point in the film.<br/></p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s Italian.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>No shit</i>.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI know. Crazy.\u201d<br/></p><p>The fact that Flash seemed to just kind of be unimpressed with his own existence was interesting to you, and a bit intriguing, and you really figured that maybe this whole bullying thing was coming from his own disinterest in his own life - a cry for help? If you will?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d Flash shrugged,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no more popcorn.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get more. I know what happens; I\u2019ve read the book,\u201d you joked, grabbing the bucket and making your way towards the lobby.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo &hellip; you feel bad for Betty or something? Trying to make her some extra cash?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You turned to see Peter standing there, close-lipped awkward smile on his face and two empty drink cups in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting MJ a refill? Nice. Very date material,\u201d you winked, wiggling your shoulders in a bit of a shimmy before turning back to the concessions and handing them the bucket.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you bet Ned and Betty that MJ and I would make out?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Wow, fuck super hearing. Of course.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d you mumbled, closing your eyes and turning back around to see Peter waiting there intently.<br/></p><p>He gave you another close-lipped smile, letting out a long breath of air through his nose,\u00a0\u201cWell now I\u2019m just getting mixed signals,\u201d he joked,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re telling <i>others</i> I\u2019m going to make out with MJ and now you\u2019re telling <i>me</i> to fuck you? Mixed signals, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth there, Petey,\u201d you wiggled your finger,\u00a0\u201cThey can hear you now.\u201d<br/></p><p>You pointed up to the heavens, knowing that the joke was may be a bit too soon, but also knowing that Peter had always known you as the joking type.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hide behind your jokes</i>, <i>Y/N</i>, you thought to yourself, <i>and maybe this cute boy won\u2019t realize you\u2019re in love with him.</i></p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Peter sighed now, admitting his lack of understanding of the situation.\u00a0\u201c<i>Flash</i>? Really, Y/N?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you know he speaks Italian?\u201d you asked him,\u00a0\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t. Yeah he\u2019s a fucking idiot and kind of a bully, but he\u2019s <i>listening</i> to me, Peter, and he\u2019s having a <i>real</i> conversation with me. Not a Stark conversation where he\u2019s too reserved to ask certain things, but he\u2019s seeing me as just another classmate.\u201d<br/></p><p>You shrugged as Peter handed the concessions guy the drinks and rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cIf he was <i>really</i> treating you like his other classmates then he <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> be hitting on you. He\u2019d be making fun of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re being honest here, I think he has more of a crush on you than anyone else,\u201d you shrugged, leaning against the counter and popping some popcorn in your mouth.\u00a0\u201cYou are his main target of interest when it comes to bullying.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe has a thing for Spider-Man,\u201d Peter chuckled.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe did find his Twitter account that one time, this is true,\u201d you nodded thoughtfully.\u00a0\u201cSo,<i> if anything</i>, he\u2019s using me as a way to get to Spider-Man. You should be flattered.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter took the drinks back and looked at you straight on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Europe. I\u2019m here having fun with my friends. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d you asked,\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re here having fun with your friends, and I\u2019m back, so I can help you with your girl issues. I really think MJ likes you. Why won\u2019t you just make a move?\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter didn\u2019t say anything as he just stared at you, his face hard and his senses a bit on the fritz as he felt the need to slam the drinks against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to do something stupid?\u201d he asked you, barely a whisper as you stopped from where the two of you had started to make your way back to the cinema.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid if I decide to do it. I\u2019m a Stark. We only make good decisions,\u201d you winked.<br/></p><p><i>Wrong</i>. History had <i>definitely</i> proven that wrong.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter\u2019s tone was a bit colder than you were used to. It stopped you in your tracks as you turned to see he was holding the cups rather tightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you going out and making any rash decisions because you\u2019re hurting,\u201d Peter said sternly,\u00a0\u201cLast time -\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Last time you weren\u2019t here</i>,\u201d you hissed, cutting him off and stepping up as close to him as you could get. Your chests were practically touching as you stared him down, challenging him to turn away.<br/></p><p>You\u2019d never been as extravagant with you drugs and alcohol and partying as your dad had been. It was probably because you had known the man he was once that was all over, and you had aspired to be like that man. But when Peter was gone &hellip; when he\u2019d &hellip; <i>left</i> &hellip; God, that had hurt you more than anything else in this world and it had prompted you to be a bit more reckless in all aspects of your life - school, crime fighting, drugs and recreation. Rhodey had gone insane looking after you.\u00a0</p><p>But in your defense, you\u2019d lost Peter twice.\u00a0</p><p><i>You first lost Peter when he left in the space ship, leaving you behind without so much as a strong hold on your hand as his lips pressed to the back of your hand, his eyebrows furrowed together tightly as he clung to you, knowing that this could be the last time he\u2019d see you.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019d been really sick when he left, or else you would have left with him. You\u2019d gone on a mission not two weeks before that and contracted some sort of chemical reaction to the lab you\u2019d crashed. It had left you frail and tired, but with your dad on the case, he\u2019d found a solution rather quickly. It was only a matter of time to heal.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Peter had swung through the window of the hospital wing, sticking to it when he landed and then tipping it open so he could topple in.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cHi hey listen quickly,\u201d he said, stumbling over to you as he worked to get his suit on. He\u2019d been on a field trip - a field trip you really hadn\u2019t been too sad to miss, if you were being honest - and you knew that he\u2019d come back here probably to get some more web fluid before going back out.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d you asked, attempting to sit up but Peter was quick to push you back down and make sure you were tucked in tightly.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo no stop. Y/N, listen.\u201d His words were rushed, and you could see some panic in his eyes as he cleared his throat and grasped your hand.\u00a0\u201cI gotta go.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat? Where? Where\u2019s my dad?\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s - it\u2019s a thing. I don\u2019t know but some - in the sky? I just needed -\u201d he held up the web fluid and continued to attempt to catch his breath.\u00a0\u201cI gotta go,\u201d he whispered, as if that explained everything.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cIn the sky? What thing?\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cSpace ship,\u201d Peter whispered, grasping your hand even tighter in both of his. He looked down at it, smoothing his thumb over the back of your hand that wasn\u2019t connected to an IV and cleared his throat, letting out a long breath.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d he mumbled again, bending down and kissing your hand strongly. You could feel his breath on your wrist from his nose, the shakiness of his hands starting to make you a bit nervous.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, stepping back as if making himself leave you.\u00a0\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded again before groaning and stepping back over to you and pressing his lips now to your forehead, running one hand through your hair as he did so.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cWell &hellip; be safe?\u201d\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>You didn\u2019t know the weight of the situation. You\u2019d seen Peter shaken like this before, but things had always turned out okay. When you\u2019d been exposed to the chemical formula, your dad had nearly had to punch Peter unconscious to keep him from tearing off the scientists\u2019 head. Peter\u2019s anger issues started around the time he met you, but you\u2019d always been able to keep him under check.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Peter nodded, gulping slightly and holding his mask. It was then you could see it in his eyes that he was scared - far more scared than he had ever been - and you started to sit up.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d you said sternly, starting to reach for the IV in your hand and in your arm but you felt the wet and cold snap of Peter\u2019s webbing hitting your hand, solidifying you to the bed.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cPETE -\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. God I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peter almost looked terrified of himself and what he\u2019d done as you struggled against the webbing,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Y/N. I gotta go.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>And then he was gone.\u00a0</i></p><p>That was the first time you lost Peter Parker - when he left you there in the hospital wing and didn\u2019t come back. And when people started disintegrating around you, there was a part of you that always <i>knew</i> Peter was gone. Peter was with your dad and he was in space and he was gone - they were both gone.\u00a0</p><p>But then you got the distress call from your dad and your pain subsided immediately. Your dad and Peter were <i>alive</i>, and Cap went with you to the ship to greet them.\u00a0</p><p>To greet, you quickly learned, a party of one.</p><p>And though every fiber in your bones was crying out that your dad was back and he was safe, there was only one look that your dad had to give you and a,\u00a0\u201cHe wanted me to say -\u201d before you felt as though you were being torn apart. Cap was beside himself with remorse at your response and had to carry you back to the jet, sedating you for the flight back so you would just <i>stop screaming</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, staring at Peter now in a cinema in Venice after four long months of longing to be near him and not know how &hellip; there was no way Peter would ever know that he was your greatest weakness.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything stupid,\u201d you told him,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> lashing out. I\u2019m exploring my options with a boy who I think likes me and sees me and could be a great distraction on this trip.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter cleared his throat, taking a step back and looking past you, away from your gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d was all he said before he walked back inside in front of you, making his way over to where MJ was watching the film intently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat took <i>ages</i>,\u201d Flash groaned, grabbing the popcorn from you as you chuckled, flicking at his popped collar.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the line,\u201d you lied easily, looking over to see Peter handing MJ her drink before hesitantly slipping an arm around the back of her chair, settling in as she molded herself against him.<br/></p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d Flash whistled under his breath,\u00a0\u201cYou might win your bet.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEasy money,\u201d you grumbled, turning back to the popcorn and remaining silent the rest of the film.\u00a0<br/></p><p>When the film was over and you were all filing out, Peter and MJ were the last ones out considering they were sitting the closest to the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d MJ asked, a bit weary to ask.<br/></p><p>Peter hummed and rubbed his eyes, adjusting the jacket he was wearing and shaking his head as if to shake out the conversation he\u2019d had with you. You were standing over by Flash and Harry and another girl from your class that Peter had always thought was nice. The two of you, he remembered, had worked on an English assignment together once and you\u2019d said she was quite bright.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d chosen a simple black dress that tied in the back with small white polka dots for the cinema, with your wedges that had the red straps that wrapped up around your ankle. You looked beautiful with your matching red lipstick and hair pulled back into a low ponytail - strategic stray hairs framing your face.\u00a0</p><p>Peter huffed, turning back to MJ and seeing she was watching him intently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty,\u201d he commented, meaning every word.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTherefore I have value?\u201d MJ smirked, seemingly unimpressed with the statement.<br/></p><p>And Peter panicked.\u00a0</p><p>He had to give MJ credit where credit was due. <i>MJ</i> had been the one to be there for him when they\u2019d all returned. <i>She</i> was the one who had come over to his house when he had nightmares, or allow him to rant for hours after a particularly bad patrol. <i>She</i> was the one who had been there for him all these months as <i>you\u2019d</i>\u00a0been the one to lock yourself away.\u00a0</p><p>And in that time, yeah, Peter had to be honest, he\u2019d started to develop feelings for MJ. It would be nice, he would admit, to see where they would go because he knew MJ\u2019s heart beat quickened whenever he was around her, and that she was particularly more twitchy whenever he was close.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t rocket science. And even rocket science was easy for Peter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d MJ quickly said, noticing Peter\u2019s large eyes and chuckling as he let out a relieved breath.\u00a0\u201cYou look pretty too.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter felt the blush on his cheeks, chuckling as he smoothed out his hair.\u00a0\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright everyone!\u201d Mr. Harrington rounded up the students once everyone had returned from the bathroom and their respective conversations.\u00a0\u201cThe evening is yours to explore as you\u2019d like. But remember, everyone needs to be at breakfast tomorrow at 8am!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWant to go for a walk?\u201d MJ asked, bumping Peters shoulder with hers as he watched her toss on her backpack.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019d be nice,\u201d he nodded, following her out into the night.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You, however, decided to call it a night then and there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to go out with us?\u201d Harry asked, slinging an arm around Flash as the two of them stood next to a cab along with Elisa and a couple other classmates.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beat. I didn\u2019t nap earlier when you all did, so I\u2019m going to crash,\u201d you chuckled,\u00a0\u201cBut have a wild night, kiddos.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it!\u201d Flash called after you as you waved them off.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You knew Venice. You\u2019d been to Venice before. And so walking back by yourself was actually quite nice, considering it was the first time you\u2019d been alone since you\u2019d left for this trip. You\u2019d gotten so used to being alone, and then you\u2019d been thrown back into society and suddenly it was a bit overwhelming.</p><p>So having this time to yourself &hellip; you were grateful.\u00a0</p><p>Your phone rang in your purse, causing you to groan and check it, only to see Nat was calling.</p><p>\u201cIs someone dying?\u201d you asked, hoping across a puddle as you continued to make your way back to your hotel.<br/></p><p>\u201cDoes someone have to be dying for me to call?\u201d Nat asked, an obvious smirk in her voice.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUsually.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell no one is dying,\u201d Nat confirmed,\u00a0\u201cBut I do <i>miss</i> you and I\u2019m trying to be more open and honest with the people I love, so I figured I\u2019d give you a call.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re going soft on me,\u201d you mused.<br/></p><p>\u201cOnly you, babe. So how\u2019s the trip?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Insufferable</i>,\u201d you grumbled,\u00a0\u201cThese kids are all stupid. They\u2019re trying their best, but the level of intellect is ghastly sometimes. I made a new friend named Betty. She\u2019s dating Ned so, obviously a keeper,\u201d you sighed, \u201cPeter\u2019s all over my ass -\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure you <i>love</i> that,\u201d Nat chuckled, causing you to gasp.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Nat</i>!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJust tell the boy you love him already,\u201d Nat groaned,\u00a0\u201cWe all have bets placed.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Well we do</i>!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You were quiet for a moment and Nat allowed you to think before you sighed.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s into someone else, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not know that. What\u2019s she like?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cPerfect. She\u2019s smart. She makes him laugh and she knows when he\u2019s in a bad mood. She helps him &hellip; she likes books.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of game where you describe yourself in third person? I\u2019ve been in a lot of therapy sessions but I\u2019ve never seen this exercise.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo! Nat -\u201d you groaned,\u00a0\u201cI told him to go after her, because she definitely likes him. They deserve each other. They\u2019re good for each other.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Nat groaned,\u00a0\u201cTeenagers are the fucking worst.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNat!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, listen, babe, I get that things have been really rough for you lately and I\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat anything or tell you that you aren\u2019t entitled to your own feelings, but you love that boy <i>so much</i> and I\u2019ve never seen anyone care for you the way that he does. He follows you around like a puppy whenever you\u2019re at the compound, and then he has no issue putting you in your place whenever you get a little too wild. He\u2019s so <i>good</i> for you, and you\u2019re <i>good</i> for him and I wish you would both just stop pining for one another and grow some balls and do something about it!\u201d<br/></p><p>You didn\u2019t respond immediately, kicking at some loose stones in the street as you closed your eyes and attempted to not cry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe just have a lot of history and &hellip; it\u2019s just really complicated,\u201d you finally said, sniffling a bit.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t give it a chance,\u201d Nat said firmly,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you want to feel the love you know you deserve? Look, I\u2019ve got to go. Sam\u2019s being an asshole and I can hear him in the training room all the way from here in the kitchen. But just have fun, okay? And trust Peter. He\u2019s cared for you longer than you know. Don\u2019t be a wimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a -\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd have fun!\u201d Nat yelled before she hung up.\u00a0<br/></p><p>God she was right, and that was the most frustrating part about it all. Nat always knew how to cut through the bullshit and be honest about what she had keenly observed. And maybe deep down you\u2019d always known Peter had feelings for you. It wasn\u2019t hard to deduct considering &hellip;\u00a0</p><p>Whatever. Feelings were stupid. History made things complicated.</p><p>This was a conversation well overdue, and if it was going to happen then it would need to happen soon if anything was going to actually come from it. You weren\u2019t entirely sure where Peter had gotten up to after the cinema, but you had a feeling he would be back at the hotel rather soon, considering when he had a chance to have a full night\u2019s sleep he would take it without a second thought.\u00a0</p><p>MJ wasn\u2019t back yet, and so you figured Peter wasn\u2019t either. Opening your laptop, you skated around some emails and some of the upcoming assignments for the field trip. You were halfway through your analysis of the film you\u2019d watched in correlation with the novel, when you heard a bump outside your door and a giggle.</p><p>The giggle was so foreign to you that you knew immediately it had to be MJ. You\u2019d never heard that girl giggle before in your entire goddamn life, and it was almost painful to hear it now considering you had a feeling you knew who it was because of.\u00a0</p><p>Peeking your eye through the little peephole in the door, you were immediately met with Peter and MJ standing in front of Peter\u2019s door. They were both giggling, laughing about something Peter had whispered in MJ\u2019s ear as he was fishing for his key.\u00a0</p><p>MJ went to say something, her fingertips trailing along his elbow, and Peter suddenly turned to look straight at her, no longer laughing as she continued to babble, unaware of his stare.</p><p>You\u2019d seen that stare before. You knew what that meant. Peter had had that stare when he\u2019d hooked up with Melissa Greyson at the end of junior year right before the field trip, and he\u2019d often stared at you that way whenever he thought you wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d MJ laughed, a hushed word escaping her mouth before Peter had her in his arm - his one strong arm looped around her waist as she gasped and looked down at him, obviously shocked.\u00a0\u201cPeter, what -\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCan I -?\u201d Peter was obviously nervous, and your heart went out to the kid that he was finally doing something about this crush and yet was completely underwater and over his head.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d MJ said so quickly it even shocked you. Sure, you\u2019d known she liked the kid, but you\u2019d never pegged MJ as one to beg.\u00a0<br/></p><p>His lips met hers and their eyes both closed and suddenly you wanted to turn away and vomit. Of course (because when in life was there not poorly timed conflict) Peter was just going to man up and kiss MJ <i>now</i>.</p><p><i>Of course.</i></p><p>Because you\u2019d told him too.\u00a0</p><p>Knowing that MJ would be coming back to your room probably quite soon after their hasty hallway make out session, you were quick to put all your things away and jump into bed, rushing to flick the light off so it looked like you\u2019d been asleep for longer than the five seconds your heart was hammering in your chest while attempting to lie still.\u00a0</p><p>And when the door finally did open and MJ came in, she of course figured you were asleep. Your back was to her, the lights were out, you had slowed down your rapid breathing enough that it was believable.\u00a0</p><p>She was quick in prepping for bed too, so you didn\u2019t have to worry about blowing your cover for too long.\u00a0</p><p>But what you should have been worried about, and what you hadn\u2019t even thought about in the heat of the moment, was the rapid beating and thundering of your heart, the adrenaline rushing through your body as you\u2019d tossed yourself around the room to prepare for MJ\u2019s entrance.\u00a0</p><p>Because no one else would have ever known you were faking your slumber, heart aching and body screaming to tear the room apart. But even from across the hall, standing in the doorway of his own door wondering if he should follow up or not, Peter\u2019s ears and senses were tuned in to the rapid and steady pounding of your heart against your ribcage.\u00a0</p><p>And though he\u2019d kissed MJ because he wanted to kiss MJ, it still made him feel a bit guilty that though he was happy about the kiss, he was a bit more interested in the fact that your heart pounding through his body had been the highlight of the night.\u00a0</p><p><i>Were you jealous?</i> It was question you were attempting to not think about, and Peter was starting to wonder.\u00a0</p><p>* * *</p><p><b><i>author\u2019s note: that was hella long and i know the timing of things and the countries aren\u2019t all accurate but this isn\u2019t supposed to be accurate to the movie because WHO KNOWS what\u2019s going to happen in the film !\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>regardless, hella angst, flash isn\u2019t that bad of a guy ? and lol @ peter just being like #theworst but also #thebest. i wrote this over the course of like a week and a half, lol, so if y\u2019all want more &hellip; you may have to wait a hot sec. unless there\u2019s just this massive influx of messages (which i know there won\u2019t be hence the setting myself up for success here), then the next update may come in a bit OR not at all lol.</i></b></p><p><b><i>but for those of you who were asking for more, here\u2019s a bit of what would have been to come. i put the intro at the top with the link for those who have not have seen that this is technically part two of a\u00a0\u201cseries\u201d so hope you enjoy it all ! and i\u2019d love to know what you may have to say about my writing/the stories/the character/what you would love to see/what you\u2019d love to know more of ! so i\u2019ll put the feedback link below, along with a link to my ko-fi because ya gurl is a poor af archaeology student trying to survive college and &hellip; four jobs ain\u2019t enough lol.</i></b></p><p><b><i>thanks for all the support ! so freaking kind, every single one of ya.</i></b></p><h2><i><b><a href=\"https://hey-marlie.tumblr.com/ask\">i\u2019m a thirsty narcissistic hoe for feedback plz send me a message</a></b></i></h2><h2><b>donate: <i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2FG2G3J972%23&amp;t=NmMyMWNmNTA3YzYxOTMyMjgxZTVlMWIwYWI0MDY0YmNkZDczZmFiMixTd2dtMnBRdA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Ax66cc1hbY_oRucCuLnQAFw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fhey-marlie.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178706066881%2Fn-o-v-e-l-t-y-ch-5&amp;m=1\">buy marlie b a coffee ?</a></i></b></h2>",

You were hobbling around for a week!\u201d<br></p><p>The two of you were laughing now quite obnoxiously, considering everyone else was quite exhausted and just wanted a quiet subway ride to the train station. But, just like old times, you and Peter were relentless.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCare to share with the class?\u201d Harry asked, sliding his sunglasses onto his face as you all followed Mr. Harrington towards the train station.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust reminiscing about the time Peter sprained his balls,\u201d you smirked, watching as Peter rolled his eyes and slung his arm around your shoulders lazily, leaving you to stagger slightly under his weight.\u00a0<br></p><p>The scrawny boy had bulked up a bit since \u2026 since the initial event \u2026 and as he pulled his phone from his pocket and seemed to be distracted by the screen, you observed his profile closely.</p><p>\u201cStop staring,\u201d Peter mumbled.<br></p><p>\u201cYou just look a bit different,\u201d you shrugged, leaning slightly into his arm as he stopped texted May of his whereabouts and slid his phone into his back pocket once more.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah? Maybe I look the same, you just haven\u2019t seen me in a while.\u201d<br></p><p>The statement was innocent. It was a fact that you\u2019d been taking your summer vacation to yourself, and had opted to finish out the end of your junior year with online courses. So yes, you\u2019d physically been apart.</p><p>But emotionally, you and Peter hadn\u2019t connected in quite some time, and that was something new for the both of you, but only the fault of one of you.</p><p>\u201cYeah well \u2026\u201d you slinked out from under Peter\u2019s arm, clearing your throat and adjusting your backpack,\u00a0\u201cSome of us process things differently.\u201d<br></p><p>You tried to pretend you didn\u2019t see the slight pain in Peter\u2019s eyes when you pulled yourself away from him. Just the momentary and innocent touch of his arm around your shoulders made you feel more at ease - even in a train station in Rome - than you had in months.</p><p>But comfort led to complacency, and you felt the need to be more alert and aware.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright well, what fancy hotel am I going to be crashing in for the next week?\u201d Flash called towards Mr. Harrington, who seemed to be completely preoccupied by every map around him that he obviously couldn\u2019t read. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute that you think you\u2019re going to be staying in some fancy digs, there, Eugene,\u201d you stated, watching as Ned snickered slightly and Betty gave you a beaming look. </p><p>You and Betty had never really been friends. She\u2019d asked you countless times if she could interview you for their morning news show and each time you\u2019d declined. You were pretty sure Peter had talked to her about it at one point after you\u2019d ranted to him about \u201cnot having any privacy at this stupid school\u201d because she soon stopped and Peter was suddenly giving a report on the photojournalism work he was doing and how he\u2019d gotten a snap of Spider-Man.</p><p>What a narcissist. </p><p>\u201cI paid to be here,\u201d Flash whined, \u201cJust give me a bed.\u201d</p><p>The bed Flash did end up getting was in a run-down looking hotel where the lobby smelled like corn chips and the man sitting behind the counter looked like he belonged in some sort of episode of <i>The Series of Unfortunate Events.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThis \u2026 is \u2026?\u201d Harry was at a loss for words as Peter pushed past him politely and set his suitcase down on a table. You watched him hesitantly as he fiddled with the handle and talked under his breath to MJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>The suitcase was something you\u2019d never seen before. It was quite large, and never was what Peter would take when the two of you traveled for your dad\u2019s trips. He usually brought along a smaller carry on that was definitely Aunt May\u2019s, considering the faded pink flowers and the floral name tag.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d never really said anything about it, and you know your dad had never mentioned it either. But you do know that your dad had bought Peter a whole set of luggage to use. So the fact that he wasn\u2019t using any of it \u2026 you weren\u2019t sure what exactly to say.\u00a0</p><p>But then you noticed the little engraving as Peter continued to fiddle absentmindedly with the handle without even looking as he and MJ continued their conversation.\u00a0</p><p><i>BFP.</i></p><p>Benjamin Franklin Parker.</p><p>You sucked in a breath at the realization that Peter was using his uncle Ben\u2019s old luggage. It made your heart warm and your body fill with little tingles as you noticed he never full let go of his luggage. God, what a goddamn cutie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay class,\u201d Mr. Harrington attempted to cut off the multiple conversations going on all at once, and you simply sat back in your seat next to Harry, who was on his phone, and watched as everyone slowly started to pay attention to your teacher.<br></p><p>\u201cRoom assignments,\u201d he held up multiple keys,\u00a0\u201cCome and collect your keys and key card with the wifi password and find your roommate.\u201d<br></p><p>It was like an odd mad dash for everyone to scramble to find the key with their name on it scribbled on the paper with the number. It didn\u2019t take long for you to find yours, or, in your case, for Peter to hand yours to you as he was shuffling through them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s you and me, girl,\u201d MJ said, twiddling her key between her fingers.\u00a0\u201cGotta say, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s you.\u201d<br></p><p>You simply nodded, unsure what to say in a situation like this. So you decided on,\u00a0\u201cThanks. Me too.\u201d</p><p>The room was small, and Ned and Peter watched from their room on the other side of the hall as you and MJ attempted to get the closet doors open.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d you simply stated, too tired to attempt to try. MJ was already flopped over on the bed, and you both seemed to come to the realization that if you were ever going to open this rusty old closet door (that probably held a body) then you were going to need someone who could lift an entire bus with one hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter opened it easily, a smirk on his face as MJ flipped him off and you simply shoved him out of the way to toss your things inside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys want to go out and explore? We have the entire afternoon to go out on our own before dinner tonight.\u201d Peter looked amongst the four of you as he awaited a response, obviously not prepared for everyone to want to take a nap once immediately landing in a new and foreign country.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude, we\u2019re jet lagged,\u201d Ned snorted,\u00a0\u201cYou honestly think I want to go out on a tour right now? We\u2019re going out tomorrow.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m good,\u201d MJ yawned,\u00a0\u201cGotta prep for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>You watched as Peter started to deflate, fiddling with the ends of his hoodie strings as he sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not jet lagged.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRich people,\u201d MJ mumbled, shooting you a playful smirk as you stuck your tongue out at her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you back gelato,\u201d you promised, before grabbing your backpack and following Peter out into the hallway.\u00a0<br></p><p>You passed Harry in the hallway where he was looking at something on his phone with Flash while you and Peter attempted to make your way by.</p><p>\u201cGuys look at this.\u201d He nearly shoved his phone into your faces as Peter squinted - a lot of light too fast - and you grasped it from him to get a better look.\u00a0<br></p><p>It was a video going viral on YouTube of some huge sandstorm in what seemed to be Libya.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you asked, squinting slightly as Peter looked over your shoulder as you got a better look at the shaky footage.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a typical sandstorm. It was what seemed to be a giant being? If you could call it that. You felt Peter\u2019s breath on your throat, causing you to grip the phone a bit tighter considering the proximity of which it was bringing Peter closer to you.\u00a0<br></p><p>Buildings were being swept up, cars being flattened, and you didn\u2019t even want to think of what had happened to the people had there been any large masses anywhere close.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSome crazy anomaly in Libya,\u201d Harry said excited,\u00a0\u201cIt straight up looks like a man.\u201d</p><p>You took the liberty of sending the link to the video to your phone, feeling the vibration in your pocket before handing it back to Harry. Flash was silent, as if gauging your reaction to what you\u2019d just seen. It was this freaky next-level bullshit that you knew used to be an Avengers project, but with the way things were now \u2026 no Tony. No Cap. Well \u2026 you weren\u2019t sure what the protocol was.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Peter offered, casually and calmly taking your hand in his as the two of you made your way towards the lobby.\u00a0<br></p><p>It was a nice sunny day, which you hadn\u2019t had in a while, and so you placed your sunglasses on your head in delight as the two of you decided to make your way towards the nearest cafe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI sent the video to myself,\u201d you told Peter as the two of you sat down and ordered some pizza. Well, you both ordered your own pizzas but you knew Peter would be eating close to both of them, saving you probably two or three slices.\u00a0<br></p><p>You pulled out your phone and watched as the hologram of the video produced itself between the two of you.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N, we don\u2019t need to watch this,\u201d Peter sighed, nearly inhaling another piece of pizza into his mouth and holding his water glass as if his life depended on it.<br></p><p>\u201cI caught this though,\u201d you pointed out, zooming in on the video - something you couldn\u2019t have done on Harry\u2019s iPhone, and freezing the video on two figures that had been standing off to the side of the shot. Too small to be seen on any regular viewing - but with some enhancing and fancy Stark tech well \u2026<br></p><p>It was obvious to you that Maria Hill and Nick Fury were on the scene.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s S.H.I.E.L.D.,\u201d you motioned to Fury as Peter squinted and turned the screen to get a better view himself.<br></p><p>\u201cYep. Sure is,\u201d he mumbled, going back to his next slice.\u00a0\u201cGood for them.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to call Happy and ask about this?\u201d you raised an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cNot going to ask me to call either?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/N, we\u2019re on vacation,\u201d Peter sighed,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re in Venice. We\u2019re eating pizza. We haven\u2019t hung out in four months. Can\u2019t you just take this time and appreciate it for what it is without having to look outside the situation to find something else?\u201d<br></p><p>You stared at Peter, simply blinking and wondering what kind of comeback you were going to have.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring the suit,\u201d Peter continued, then winced,\u00a0\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t pack the suit with any thought of being Spider-Man here. May was the one that tucked it in there last minute. Nearly blew my cover through customs.\u201d<br></p><p>You chuckled at this, knowing the Peter Parker Panic Face all too well.\u00a0</p><p>There was something surreal about being here with Peter and just relaxing. You couldn\u2019t remember the last time you\u2019d felt this at ease. He was looking over across San Marco square and just sipping his water like the pretty boy he was, and you were sitting here not focusing on him and God, that was a crime.</p><p>You turned your phone off and cleared your throat,\u00a0\u201cSo \u2026 you and MJ.\u201d</p><p>Peter choked on his water, doubling over slightly as he wiped his mouth on his flannel and looked over at you questionably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou and Michelle Jones,\u201d you smirked,\u00a0\u201cI can see it. I\u2019ll have to gossip with Ned later. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s head of the fan club.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo - Y/N, no. That\u2019s not -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d you shrugged, cutting him off because really, you did not want to hear the explanation.\u00a0\u201cYou two have always been close. You both went through a lot together, so I can understand the connection.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter scoffed and leaned back in his chair,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together and we aren\u2019t going to date.\u201d</p><p>You broke your straw just like that, one flick of your fingers and it snapped as Peter stared at you with wide eyes.\u00a0\u201cYou okay?\u201d he chuckled.</p><p><i>No I\u2019m not fucking okay. Love me!</i> you screamed, internally, where your broken and selfish heart was having a bitch-fit to break free from the cage you\u2019d put around it. Your heart just couldn\u2019t stay in its fucking lane.</p><p>You composed yourself and shrugged,\u00a0\u201cWhy are you suddenly lying to me? Just be honest. Do you have feelings for MJ?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated and it was then that you knew you were toast. You were the butt end of a loaf of bread that got stuck in the toaster after being put off for days because no one really wanted you, but you were the only option left.\u00a0</p><p>But Peter wasn\u2019t yours. Peter may have been yours at one point when the two of you were thick as thieves, running around the compound and attempting to make your dad laugh whenever you tried out new gadgets and blasted the Inspector Gadget theme song hopped up on energy drinks.\u00a0</p><p>He was yours when you\u2019d lay awake at night talking about things that had always bothered the two of you about growing up so young in an atmosphere the Avengers had pulled you into.</p><p>He\u2019d been yours every time he smiled in your direction at school or slid into the bench at lunch next to you, or cheered whenever Happy would allow either of you to drive the fancy car that would pick you up from school.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d been yours for a night once. But the thought had your whole body seemingly bursting into flames and aching as if being probed intensely under the brightest and harshest of lights.\u00a0</p><p>But now, sitting across from him in Venice where your toes were touching and Peter was looking like sunshine behind his sunglasses, and you were sitting in your favorite cardigan with one and a half pizzas eaten between you \u2026 you knew Peter wasn\u2019t yours anymore.</p><p>Four months was a long time. One sunny day in Venice couldn\u2019t change anything.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone through a lot,\u201d Peter sighed, pulling you back into the conversation.\u00a0\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve all been through a lot. But uh \u2026\u201d Peter sighed and ruffled his hair,\u00a0\u201cShe took it like a champ. The therapy, the new job \u2026 she had Mr. Delmar smiling every day when she\u2019d arrive for work, you know? And she\u2019s always been proud and confident, but she\u2019s been more caring and aware of the student body since everything has happened and honestly? I\u2019ve been impressed.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter shrugged, as if his declaration would mean anything less.\u00a0</p><p>A breeze washed over the two of you and you caught a whiff of his scent - the mix of cologne and boyish charm you\u2019ve always associated with Peter since you\u2019d met him.</p><p>You wondered sometimes what your smell was like to him. Well, you at least tried not to think about that anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go for it?\u201d you encouraged.\u00a0<br></p><p>You weren\u2019t a <i>bitch</i>. Well, okay yeah you <i>definitely</i> were a bitch. But you\u2019d never been a bitch by default. That was a hard exterior you\u2019d built up over the years prior to meeting Peter, and since he\u2019d come into your life like the who goddamn sun that he was - not even just a ray of sunshine - he had been slowly chipping away at that persona to find the happy sunshine girl underneath that you\u2019d always been.\u00a0</p><p>But you were never and will never be a bitch to your friends - especially Peter. And if helping Peter find someone that would take care of him and be there for him and take the time to understand him \u2026 then fuck it, you were Team MJ more than even Ned Leeds probably was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend, Y/N, I can\u2019t just \u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe likes you,\u201d you scoffed, rolling your eyes and shoving your sunglasses down your face so you could look Peter more aggressively in the eyes.\u00a0\u201cI know I\u2019ve been gone for a while, but that girl has liked you for ages, and she seems to be smitten with you now more than ever.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter\u2019s blushing, and you would continue to push him until he\u2019d just admit his feelings, if you didn\u2019t see some of your school group over his shoulder making their way towards you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell well well,\u201d you chuckled, sitting up straighter and shoving your glasses back on your face as the MJ in question plopped down next to Peter and grabbed his water glass from him, chugging it.\u00a0<br></p><p>You smirked as Peter looked at her obviously in shock, and she seemed to not be in the mood to look his way.\u00a0\u201cTired,\u201d she grumbled, reaching over for a slice of pizza still left.</p><p>\u201cThose beds are not \u2026 comfortable,\u201d Ned grumbled,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how Betty is still sleeping.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou just miss your super nice therapeutic mattress,\u201d you joked,\u00a0\u201cYou still have that right? Storm Trooper sheets and all?\u201d<br></p><p>Ned laughed and swatted at your arm lazily, sitting back in his chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it like being back in the land of the living?\u201d Harry asked you, sitting down on your other side and wrapping his arm around the back of your seat.\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry was a nice kid. Harry could be fun. Harry would make for a great distraction for the whole Peter and MJ thing that you were sure was happening. So you leaned into his touch.</p><p>Sighing, you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cMuch more lively than throwing darts and shooting guns at targets all day with Nat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that you casually name drop the Black Widow,\u201d Harry snorted and shook his head,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, girl.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell she has been hanging out with Black Widow,\u201d MJ pointed out, smirking towards you with a flicker of admiration.\u00a0<br></p><p>Girls were so fucking petty. You knew you got lucky when you realized the only person who you may ever have to compete for attention from Peter was MJ. She was so chill and like a goddamn queen with her intellect, looks, and wit. Hell, you always told yourself that if Peter and MJ did end up together, at least you\u2019d know you\u2019d have a super cool friend for life along with Peter.</p><p>So why it was irking you so much that Peter was staring at MJ\u2019s profile - moments after you\u2019d suggested he just go for it\u00a0 - well \u2026 girls are petty.\u00a0</p><p>When dinner came, you were all herded towards an older restaurant that you were pretty sure you were only going to because Mr. Harrington had read five thousand reviews on Yelp. He kept using words you were sure he wasn\u2019t familiar with when it came to the culinary craft, and it seemed he was the only one excited.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to eat my weight in pasta,\u201d Flash smoothed out his blazer as you patted his shoulder. You weren\u2019t sure when it started, considering you\u2019d only really been back with these kids for about a day and a half, but Flash was suddenly hovering around you in an oddly protective manner.<br></p><p>Considering the kind words he\u2019d shared with you at the airport, and then the fact that he\u2019d been quiet and respectful whenever you\u2019d talked since, made you wonder if maybe Flash really was trying to be a better person instead of the attention-seeking prideful bully you\u2019d known him to be in the past.\u00a0</p><p>But then he shoved Peter as you were all walking into the restaurant and you couldn\u2019t help but want to shove him into the Venice canals and run him over with a gondola.\u00a0</p><p>The meal was just fine, considering everyone was starving and the jet lag was starting to kick in so everyone was rowdy. You\u2019d never been abroad with a group of students before, only ever with your dad, and the closest you\u2019d ever come to a European vacation was when you and Peter finished your mission in Rome by highjacking the jet that was sent for you and spending a long weekend in Monte Carlo.\u00a0</p><p>You shuddered just thinking about it.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone was lagging by the time Mr. Harrington started to drag you all to the cinema to watch some Italian film based off a book you were all supposed to read. The only one to actually read it was MJ, and even she didn\u2019t want to see the film, but \u2026 that\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter cleared his throat and placed his hands together, pointing at you with both his hands. It made you smile, because it was something your dad used to do and a bit of a joke that you and Peter had picked up to mess with him. And now seeing Peter do it gave you this odd feeling of home, mixed with a bit of guilt and regret \u2026 but mostly home.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay indeed,\u201d you nodded, sauntering along with MJ, Ned, and Betty in the back of the group as everyone followed a very confused teacher who was bad at maps.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s place bets. Who are we thinking tonight?\u201d MJ asked, skipping from one stone to the next with calculated precision and balance.\u00a0\u201cObviously I want to put ten on Bets and Nedd-o.\u201d<br></p><p>Ned rolled his eyes,\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019re a couple! You can\u2019t place bets on us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d Betty looked around, obviously confused considering the conversation was completely and ridiculously immature, but tradition.<br></p><p>\u201cWhenever we watch films in school the four of us would usually place bets on who would get with who -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhom,\u201d you corrected Peter. He rolled his eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cOh who would get with whom,\u201d he shot you a look,\u00a0\u201cwhile the lights were out. And considering Mr. Harrington has us watch a lot of films, the four of us have made some good money over the years.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou and Stevie Preston got me fifty bucks,\u201d you told Betty.<br></p><p>\u201cI still have no idea how you got that one,\u201d MJ groaned,\u00a0\u201cWhy did you cuddle with Stevie anyway? His posture is atrocious and he\u2019s always talking about his bug collection.\u201d<br></p><p>Betty looked confused,\u00a0\u201cWell, that day specifically he was wearing this jacket that smelled really nice like lavender, and that\u2019s my favorite smell and he told me he liked my new green brooch so \u2026 I don\u2019t know. I was feeling sentimental,\u201d Betty shrugged.\u00a0\u201cObviously a one time thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Peter grumbled,\u00a0\u201cYou and Stevie Preston cost me fifty bucks.\u201d</p><p>You patted Peter\u2019s cheek happily before laughing.\u00a0\u201cIt was simple, really,\u201d you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI manufactured the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d MJ shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo really,\u201d you smiled,\u00a0\u201cI knew Betty liked the smell of lavender considering the hand lotion you always use after gym class before we went to lunch. And Stevie is always one for getting cold - he never wears a jacket - and that morning when I noticed he was chilly, I handed over one of Peter\u2019s old hoodies he\u2019d left at my place ages ago that I\u2019d put lavender perfume on. Then, I noticed the pride you had in your new brooch, Bets, so I simply commented on it in the presence of Stevie, who obviously had a crush on you, and mentioned how people don\u2019t notice nice things like that anymore and girls like when guys notice those things. So \u2026 Stevie comments on your brooch and smells like lavender and BOOM I manufactured love.\u201d<br></p><p>No one said anything as you continued to walk, but all of them clearly looked dumbstruck. There was a mix of fear and awe in Peter\u2019s eyes, which turned into pride as he broke out into a smile.\u00a0\u201cAnd then you out of the blue bet me fifty knowing that it would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also knew you had fifty because my dad paid you the day before and I knew I wanted to go to that thai place for dinner and I could get you to go if I had the money to do so. Which, prior to our bet, I did not.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou two are seriously twisted,\u201d Ned shook his head,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like you feed off one another. I bet your murders take half the time to plan when you decide to go in on it together.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes as Peter laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll bet Jon and Samantha will at least make out once,\u201d MJ cleared her throat,\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ve been secretly hooking up all summer.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d Peter asked, twisting his body slightly to look back at where MJ was trailing behind him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause they never stand farther than arm\u2019s length apart. That means at least something,\u201d MJ rolled her eyes.<br></p><p>You watched as Peter\u2019s eyes traveled from his arm to yours, noticing the short distance between the two of you before he attempted to hesitantly shift away a bit farther.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell how much and against whom are you betting then?\u201d you asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say a solid fifteen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWeak.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLogical,\u201d MJ countered.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso weak,\u201d you snickered.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Peter laughed, pushing you slightly as you bat childishly at his hand.<br></p><p>\u201cGod stop flirting and just make out in a closet somewhere already,\u201d Ned joked. Three separate interactions took place where you shot Ned a look, Peter immediately looked away from you while blushing, and MJ went a bit rigid, looking down at her feet.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a bet,\u201d you said, turning and walking backwards so you could get a good look at everyone\u2019s faces.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer allowed,\u201d MJ stuck her tongue out at you, the prior Ned comment having passed within the length of five paces.\u00a0\u201cYou manufacture love. That\u2019s cheating.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t have anything on me now to do so, now do I?\u201d you asked, opening your arms as if to prove a point.<br></p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Peter cocked his head slightly, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had a lot of points, but she\u2019s still a cheater,\u201d MJ shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m vetoing your bet.\u201d<br></p><p>You huffed,\u00a0\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll place one,\u201d Betty spoke up, a bit timid.\u00a0</p><p>Betty was a smart girl, there was no denying that. Her drive and spunk gave her an upper hand on majority of the school. She was going to be an ace reporter one day, that was for sure, but in the midst of three geniuses - you, Peter and MJ - well, anyone would be a bit timid when trying to impress your boyfriend\u2019s best friends.<br></p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you cheered,\u00a0\u201cNow this is getting interesting! Place your bets, Bets.\u201d<br></p><p>A bit of a pink blush tinted Betty\u2019s cheeks as she spoke,\u00a0\u201cI bet twenty euros that Flash will try to make out with Y/N during the film.\u201d</p><p>Oxygen seemed to funnel from the group as everyone remained silent long enough for their shock to cling to every fiber of their bones. No one had bet on you before, minus the first three times that Ned had bet MJ that you and Peter would lean in and cuddle at some point.\u00a0</p><p>But that was a given, and Ned and MJ had quickly grown tired of losing their money to one another.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFlash?\u201d you stumbled slightly from walking backwards and Peter was quick to catch you, straightening you out as you cleared your throat.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s some big talk there Bets.\u201d<br></p><p>Betty shrugged,\u00a0\u201cEveryone can see he\u2019s been trying to make a move since you got back. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he and Harry are secretly fighting over you. Flash has always had something for you, we all know it, and if Harry give you one more look while you\u2019re not looking at him then he might die right then and there.\u201d</p><p>You were blushing now, feeling a deep warmth splinter through your entire body.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d was all you said before turning back around and swiftly doing your best to keep up with the group.<br></p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d Betty asked, watching your retreating figure as Peter nibbled on his bottom lip. Betty wasn\u2019t the only one that had noticed Flash\u2019s interest in you, or the way Harry\u2019s stare had lingered everywhere you go since you\u2019d returned to the living. It had made his skin crawl with an uncomfortable feeling settling in the tips of his fingers that itched to grasp you as tight as he could and hide you away from prying eyes.<br></p><p>But that wasn\u2019t his job.</p><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t,\u201d MJ said, coming up a bit closer so her shoulder brushed against Peter\u2019s as they walked,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s just a bit sensitive to \u2026 relationships, I think. It\u2019s never really been her thing.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRelationships?\u201d Betty furrowed her eyebrows, obviously confused.</p><p>\u201cEmotional commitment,\u201d MJ corrected.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell I wonder why,\u201d Peter mumbled, more to himself, but MJ looked to him and he could tell she was struggling to figure out a way to explain you to others that wouldn\u2019t sound like she was judging. MJ meant well, and Peter appreciated that.<br></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll take that bet, baby,\u201d Ned said, grasping Betty\u2019s hand and squeezing it tight. Betty smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>As everyone filed into the cinema, you plopped down in the middle, ready for Peter to find a seat next to you and allow you to toss your legs across his lap. But instead, Flash - speak of the devil - sat down next to you and adjusted himself so he was more lounging than sitting.</p><p>\u201cYou read this?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d you rolled your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah you did.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash looked at you as you let out a long huff through your nose, turning and facing him, locking eyes in a challenging way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Fine</i>. Maybe I did.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash smiled.\u00a0\u201cSee, you can pretend you don\u2019t care about all this literature and history and art. You\u2019re a science kid through and through - I get that. But you also aced all our art history tests last spring term, and you even won our history essay contest. This shit excites you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018<i>This shit</i>,\u2019\u201d you snorted,\u00a0\u201cNice.\u201d<br></p><p>Betty and Ned settled down in front of you, Betty looking over her shoulder to give you a quick, bold suggestive look. You smirked. Leaning forward, you placed your head between Ned and Betty, clearing your throat for attention.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will bet you both fifty bucks that by the end of tonight, Peter and MJ will make out.\u201d<br></p><p>Ned nearly spit out all his water as Betty gasped so loudly that everyone turned to see if she was alright. You locked eyes with Peter, from where he and MJ were sitting a bit off to the side, two rows in front of Ned and Betty. You winked at him and made a little kissy face before turning your attention back to Betty and Ned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you accept my bet?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Hell yeah</i> I accept your bet,\u201d Ned laughed, turning to face you,\u00a0\u201cI would love fifty bucks.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re about to lose it, so cherish it now,\u201d you winked before sitting back in your seat.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Flash asked, tossing some popcorn in his mouth. You leaned over and helped yourself, chewing slowly as you thought.<br></p><p>\u201cI just bet Betty and Ned each fifty bucks that Peter and MJ would be making out by the end of tonight.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash stared at you, a bit dumbfounded, as he finally broke out into a low chuckle.\u00a0\u201cYeah right. You\u2019d sell all your secrets to the media before allowing MJ to kiss your man.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Turning to look at Flash, you could tell in his smug expression that the rise he\u2019d gotten out of you was exactly what he was hoping for.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, <i>come on</i> Y/N,\u201d Flash chuckled and turned to face you a bit more as the lights dimmed for the film.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t honestly expect me to have been in the same classroom as you and Dr. Prodigy over there for the past four years and not see clear as day that you are <i>obviously</i> in love with him.\u201d<br></p><p>You blinked, giving yourself some time to process this, as you reached out and grabbed some more popcorn.\u00a0\u201cStupid,\u201d was the only remark you could think to utter.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I was there when you found out that Peter had \u2026\u201d Flash trailed off and cleared his throat,\u00a0\u201cYou <i>punched</i> a security guard right in the <i>face</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe lost a lot of people. I thought my dad had also died then,\u201d you recalled.</p><p>Flash rolled his eyes and adjusted the popcorn on his lap so it was more centered towards you, the one who was obviously going to be eating more of it.\u00a0\u201cYou can say whatever you want, Y/N, but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are stupid.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not <i>that</i> stupid,\u201d Flash quipped back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to love him, you know. Like, he\u2019s a nerd and a <i>total loser</i> but I bet you guys have a lot of fun with the internship. Having access to that kind of tech \u2026 I mean, hell yeah I can see where the whole friends to lovers situation blossomed in your little stone cold heart.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in denial,\u201d Flash shrugged.<br></p><p>\u201cI want Peter to be happy,\u201d you hissed, attempting to not take away from the film.\u00a0\u201cAnd MJ makes him happy.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash shrugged,\u00a0\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attempting to speak it into existence, <i>sure</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash was sitting there smug, watching the film and sighing,\u00a0\u201cThese subtitles are wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Italian.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes actually, I <i>do</i> speak Italian.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou speak Italian?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Oh my God</i> are you deaf?\u201d<br></p><p>You and Flash looked at one another for a moment as he smirked, his eyes twinkling as he was obviously enjoying this conversation. You couldn\u2019t believe that resident idiot Flash Thompson was actually \u2026 observant \u2026 and smart?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d you laughed lightly, shaking your head and sinking down in your seat to be on Flash\u2019s level.</p><p>\u201cNumber one bully, you know that,\u201d Flash shrugged.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh my God. Are you one of those angsty art kids that is super good at science and maths but secretly wants to be the next Vincent van Gogh?\u201d<br></p><p>Flash rolled his eyes,\u00a0\u201cI only know you aced all your art history exams because you\u2019re the only one that got higher marks than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Holy shit</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Flash nodded.\u00a0<br></p><p>You actually watched the rest of the film. And considering you had read the book, listening to the Italian and enjoying the subtitles and plot twists was more thrilling considering you had a familiarity for the story. And, somehow without your knowledge, you\u2019d slowly found yourself leaning against Flash as the two of you shared the rest of his popcorn.\u00a0</p><p>His arm was warm, and the kind of arm that was comfortable to lean your head on instead of the back of the cinema seats.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d you learn Italian?\u201d you asked at some point in the film.<br></p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s Italian.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>No shit</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know. Crazy.\u201d<br></p><p>The fact that Flash seemed to just kind of be unimpressed with his own existence was interesting to you, and a bit intriguing, and you really figured that maybe this whole bullying thing was coming from his own disinterest in his own life - a cry for help? If you will?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d Flash shrugged,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no more popcorn.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get more. I know what happens; I\u2019ve read the book,\u201d you joked, grabbing the bucket and making your way towards the lobby.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo \u2026 you feel bad for Betty or something? Trying to make her some extra cash?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You turned to see Peter standing there, close-lipped awkward smile on his face and two empty drink cups in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting MJ a refill? Nice. Very date material,\u201d you winked, wiggling your shoulders in a bit of a shimmy before turning back to the concessions and handing them the bucket.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you bet Ned and Betty that MJ and I would make out?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Wow, fuck super hearing. Of course.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d you mumbled, closing your eyes and turning back around to see Peter waiting there intently.<br></p><p>He gave you another close-lipped smile, letting out a long breath of air through his nose,\u00a0\u201cWell now I\u2019m just getting mixed signals,\u201d he joked,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re telling <i>others</i> I\u2019m going to make out with MJ and now you\u2019re telling <i>me</i> to fuck you? Mixed signals, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth there, Petey,\u201d you wiggled your finger,\u00a0\u201cThey can hear you now.\u201d<br></p><p>You pointed up to the heavens, knowing that the joke was may be a bit too soon, but also knowing that Peter had always known you as the joking type.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hide behind your jokes</i>, <i>Y/N</i>, you thought to yourself, <i>and maybe this cute boy won\u2019t realize you\u2019re in love with him.</i></p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Peter sighed now, admitting his lack of understanding of the situation.\u00a0\u201c<i>Flash</i>? Really, Y/N?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid you know he speaks Italian?\u201d you asked him,\u00a0\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t. Yeah he\u2019s a fucking idiot and kind of a bully, but he\u2019s <i>listening</i> to me, Peter, and he\u2019s having a <i>real</i> conversation with me. Not a Stark conversation where he\u2019s too reserved to ask certain things, but he\u2019s seeing me as just another classmate.\u201d<br></p><p>You shrugged as Peter handed the concessions guy the drinks and rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cIf he was <i>really</i> treating you like his other classmates then he <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> be hitting on you. He\u2019d be making fun of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re being honest here, I think he has more of a crush on you than anyone else,\u201d you shrugged, leaning against the counter and popping some popcorn in your mouth.\u00a0\u201cYou are his main target of interest when it comes to bullying.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe has a thing for Spider-Man,\u201d Peter chuckled.<br></p><p>\u201cWe did find his Twitter account that one time, this is true,\u201d you nodded thoughtfully.\u00a0\u201cSo,<i> if anything</i>, he\u2019s using me as a way to get to Spider-Man. You should be flattered.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter took the drinks back and looked at you straight on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Europe. I\u2019m here having fun with my friends. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d you asked,\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re here having fun with your friends, and I\u2019m back, so I can help you with your girl issues. I really think MJ likes you. Why won\u2019t you just make a move?\u201d<br></p><p>Peter didn\u2019t say anything as he just stared at you, his face hard and his senses a bit on the fritz as he felt the need to slam the drinks against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to do something stupid?\u201d he asked you, barely a whisper as you stopped from where the two of you had started to make your way back to the cinema.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid if I decide to do it. I\u2019m a Stark. We only make good decisions,\u201d you winked.<br></p><p><i>Wrong</i>. History had <i>definitely</i> proven that wrong.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter\u2019s tone was a bit colder than you were used to. It stopped you in your tracks as you turned to see he was holding the cups rather tightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you going out and making any rash decisions because you\u2019re hurting,\u201d Peter said sternly,\u00a0\u201cLast time -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Last time you weren\u2019t here</i>,\u201d you hissed, cutting him off and stepping up as close to him as you could get. Your chests were practically touching as you stared him down, challenging him to turn away.<br></p><p>You\u2019d never been as extravagant with you drugs and alcohol and partying as your dad had been. It was probably because you had known the man he was once that was all over, and you had aspired to be like that man. But when Peter was gone \u2026 when he\u2019d \u2026 <i>left</i> \u2026 God, that had hurt you more than anything else in this world and it had prompted you to be a bit more reckless in all aspects of your life - school, crime fighting, drugs and recreation. Rhodey had gone insane looking after you.\u00a0</p><p>But in your defense, you\u2019d lost Peter twice.\u00a0</p><p><i>You first lost Peter when he left in the space ship, leaving you behind without so much as a strong hold on your hand as his lips pressed to the back of your hand, his eyebrows furrowed together tightly as he clung to you, knowing that this could be the last time he\u2019d see you.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019d been really sick when he left, or else you would have left with him. You\u2019d gone on a mission not two weeks before that and contracted some sort of chemical reaction to the lab you\u2019d crashed. It had left you frail and tired, but with your dad on the case, he\u2019d found a solution rather quickly. It was only a matter of time to heal.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Peter had swung through the window of the hospital wing, sticking to it when he landed and then tipping it open so he could topple in.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cHi hey listen quickly,\u201d he said, stumbling over to you as he worked to get his suit on. He\u2019d been on a field trip - a field trip you really hadn\u2019t been too sad to miss, if you were being honest - and you knew that he\u2019d come back here probably to get some more web fluid before going back out.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d you asked, attempting to sit up but Peter was quick to push you back down and make sure you were tucked in tightly.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo no stop. Y/N, listen.\u201d His words were rushed, and you could see some panic in his eyes as he cleared his throat and grasped your hand.\u00a0\u201cI gotta go.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat? Where? Where\u2019s my dad?\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s - it\u2019s a thing. I don\u2019t know but some - in the sky? I just needed -\u201d he held up the web fluid and continued to attempt to catch his breath.\u00a0\u201cI gotta go,\u201d he whispered, as if that explained everything.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cIn the sky? What thing?\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cSpace ship,\u201d Peter whispered, grasping your hand even tighter in both of his. He looked down at it, smoothing his thumb over the back of your hand that wasn\u2019t connected to an IV and cleared his throat, letting out a long breath.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d he mumbled again, bending down and kissing your hand strongly. You could feel his breath on your wrist from his nose, the shakiness of his hands starting to make you a bit nervous.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, stepping back as if making himself leave you.\u00a0\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded again before groaning and stepping back over to you and pressing his lips now to your forehead, running one hand through your hair as he did so.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWell \u2026 be safe?\u201d\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>You didn\u2019t know the weight of the situation. You\u2019d seen Peter shaken like this before, but things had always turned out okay. When you\u2019d been exposed to the chemical formula, your dad had nearly had to punch Peter unconscious to keep him from tearing off the scientists\u2019 head. Peter\u2019s anger issues started around the time he met you, but you\u2019d always been able to keep him under check.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Peter nodded, gulping slightly and holding his mask. It was then you could see it in his eyes that he was scared - far more scared than he had ever been - and you started to sit up.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d you said sternly, starting to reach for the IV in your hand and in your arm but you felt the wet and cold snap of Peter\u2019s webbing hitting your hand, solidifying you to the bed.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cPETE -\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. God I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peter almost looked terrified of himself and what he\u2019d done as you struggled against the webbing,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Y/N. I gotta go.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>And then he was gone.\u00a0</i></p><p>That was the first time you lost Peter Parker - when he left you there in the hospital wing and didn\u2019t come back. And when people started disintegrating around you, there was a part of you that always <i>knew</i> Peter was gone. Peter was with your dad and he was in space and he was gone - they were both gone.\u00a0</p><p>But then you got the distress call from your dad and your pain subsided immediately. Your dad and Peter were <i>alive</i>, and Cap went with you to the ship to greet them.\u00a0</p><p>To greet, you quickly learned, a party of one.</p><p>And though every fiber in your bones was crying out that your dad was back and he was safe, there was only one look that your dad had to give you and a,\u00a0\u201cHe wanted me to say -\u201d before you felt as though you were being torn apart. Cap was beside himself with remorse at your response and had to carry you back to the jet, sedating you for the flight back so you would just <i>stop screaming</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, staring at Peter now in a cinema in Venice after four long months of longing to be near him and not know how \u2026 there was no way Peter would ever know that he was your greatest weakness.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything stupid,\u201d you told him,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> lashing out. I\u2019m exploring my options with a boy who I think likes me and sees me and could be a great distraction on this trip.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter cleared his throat, taking a step back and looking past you, away from your gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d was all he said before he walked back inside in front of you, making his way over to where MJ was watching the film intently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat took <i>ages</i>,\u201d Flash groaned, grabbing the popcorn from you as you chuckled, flicking at his popped collar.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the line,\u201d you lied easily, looking over to see Peter handing MJ her drink before hesitantly slipping an arm around the back of her chair, settling in as she molded herself against him.<br></p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d Flash whistled under his breath,\u00a0\u201cYou might win your bet.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEasy money,\u201d you grumbled, turning back to the popcorn and remaining silent the rest of the film.\u00a0<br></p><p>When the film was over and you were all filing out, Peter and MJ were the last ones out considering they were sitting the closest to the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d MJ asked, a bit weary to ask.<br></p><p>Peter hummed and rubbed his eyes, adjusting the jacket he was wearing and shaking his head as if to shake out the conversation he\u2019d had with you. You were standing over by Flash and Harry and another girl from your class that Peter had always thought was nice. The two of you, he remembered, had worked on an English assignment together once and you\u2019d said she was quite bright.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d chosen a simple black dress that tied in the back with small white polka dots for the cinema, with your wedges that had the red straps that wrapped up around your ankle. You looked beautiful with your matching red lipstick and hair pulled back into a low ponytail - strategic stray hairs framing your face.\u00a0</p><p>Peter huffed, turning back to MJ and seeing she was watching him intently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty,\u201d he commented, meaning every word.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTherefore I have value?\u201d MJ smirked, seemingly unimpressed with the statement.<br></p><p>And Peter panicked.\u00a0</p><p>He had to give MJ credit where credit was due. <i>MJ</i> had been the one to be there for him when they\u2019d all returned. <i>She</i> was the one who had come over to his house when he had nightmares, or allow him to rant for hours after a particularly bad patrol. <i>She</i> was the one who had been there for him all these months as <i>you\u2019d</i>\u00a0been the one to lock yourself away.\u00a0</p><p>And in that time, yeah, Peter had to be honest, he\u2019d started to develop feelings for MJ. It would be nice, he would admit, to see where they would go because he knew MJ\u2019s heart beat quickened whenever he was around her, and that she was particularly more twitchy whenever he was close.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t rocket science. And even rocket science was easy for Peter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d MJ quickly said, noticing Peter\u2019s large eyes and chuckling as he let out a relieved breath.\u00a0\u201cYou look pretty too.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter felt the blush on his cheeks, chuckling as he smoothed out his hair.\u00a0\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright everyone!\u201d Mr. Harrington rounded up the students once everyone had returned from the bathroom and their respective conversations.\u00a0\u201cThe evening is yours to explore as you\u2019d like. But remember, everyone needs to be at breakfast tomorrow at 8am!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWant to go for a walk?\u201d MJ asked, bumping Peters shoulder with hers as he watched her toss on her backpack.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019d be nice,\u201d he nodded, following her out into the night.\u00a0<br></p><p>You, however, decided to call it a night then and there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to go out with us?\u201d Harry asked, slinging an arm around Flash as the two of them stood next to a cab along with Elisa and a couple other classmates.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beat. I didn\u2019t nap earlier when you all did, so I\u2019m going to crash,\u201d you chuckled,\u00a0\u201cBut have a wild night, kiddos.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it!\u201d Flash called after you as you waved them off.\u00a0<br></p><p>You knew Venice. You\u2019d been to Venice before. And so walking back by yourself was actually quite nice, considering it was the first time you\u2019d been alone since you\u2019d left for this trip. You\u2019d gotten so used to being alone, and then you\u2019d been thrown back into society and suddenly it was a bit overwhelming.</p><p>So having this time to yourself \u2026 you were grateful.\u00a0</p><p>Your phone rang in your purse, causing you to groan and check it, only to see Nat was calling.</p><p>\u201cIs someone dying?\u201d you asked, hoping across a puddle as you continued to make your way back to your hotel.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes someone have to be dying for me to call?\u201d Nat asked, an obvious smirk in her voice.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUsually.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell no one is dying,\u201d Nat confirmed,\u00a0\u201cBut I do <i>miss</i> you and I\u2019m trying to be more open and honest with the people I love, so I figured I\u2019d give you a call.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re going soft on me,\u201d you mused.<br></p><p>\u201cOnly you, babe. So how\u2019s the trip?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Insufferable</i>,\u201d you grumbled,\u00a0\u201cThese kids are all stupid. They\u2019re trying their best, but the level of intellect is ghastly sometimes. I made a new friend named Betty. She\u2019s dating Ned so, obviously a keeper,\u201d you sighed, \u201cPeter\u2019s all over my ass -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure you <i>love</i> that,\u201d Nat chuckled, causing you to gasp.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Nat</i>!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust tell the boy you love him already,\u201d Nat groaned,\u00a0\u201cWe all have bets placed.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Well we do</i>!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You were quiet for a moment and Nat allowed you to think before you sighed.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s into someone else, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not know that. What\u2019s she like?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cPerfect. She\u2019s smart. She makes him laugh and she knows when he\u2019s in a bad mood. She helps him \u2026 she likes books.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of game where you describe yourself in third person? I\u2019ve been in a lot of therapy sessions but I\u2019ve never seen this exercise.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo! Nat -\u201d you groaned,\u00a0\u201cI told him to go after her, because she definitely likes him. They deserve each other. They\u2019re good for each other.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Nat groaned,\u00a0\u201cTeenagers are the fucking worst.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNat!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, listen, babe, I get that things have been really rough for you lately and I\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat anything or tell you that you aren\u2019t entitled to your own feelings, but you love that boy <i>so much</i> and I\u2019ve never seen anyone care for you the way that he does. He follows you around like a puppy whenever you\u2019re at the compound, and then he has no issue putting you in your place whenever you get a little too wild. He\u2019s so <i>good</i> for you, and you\u2019re <i>good</i> for him and I wish you would both just stop pining for one another and grow some balls and do something about it!\u201d<br></p><p>You didn\u2019t respond immediately, kicking at some loose stones in the street as you closed your eyes and attempted to not cry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe just have a lot of history and \u2026 it\u2019s just really complicated,\u201d you finally said, sniffling a bit.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t give it a chance,\u201d Nat said firmly,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you want to feel the love you know you deserve? Look, I\u2019ve got to go. Sam\u2019s being an asshole and I can hear him in the training room all the way from here in the kitchen. But just have fun, okay? And trust Peter. He\u2019s cared for you longer than you know. Don\u2019t be a wimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd have fun!\u201d Nat yelled before she hung up.\u00a0<br></p><p>God she was right, and that was the most frustrating part about it all. Nat always knew how to cut through the bullshit and be honest about what she had keenly observed. And maybe deep down you\u2019d always known Peter had feelings for you. It wasn\u2019t hard to deduct considering \u2026\u00a0</p><p>Whatever. Feelings were stupid. History made things complicated.</p><p>This was a conversation well overdue, and if it was going to happen then it would need to happen soon if anything was going to actually come from it. You weren\u2019t entirely sure where Peter had gotten up to after the cinema, but you had a feeling he would be back at the hotel rather soon, considering when he had a chance to have a full night\u2019s sleep he would take it without a second thought.\u00a0</p><p>MJ wasn\u2019t back yet, and so you figured Peter wasn\u2019t either. Opening your laptop, you skated around some emails and some of the upcoming assignments for the field trip. You were halfway through your analysis of the film you\u2019d watched in correlation with the novel, when you heard a bump outside your door and a giggle.</p><p>The giggle was so foreign to you that you knew immediately it had to be MJ. You\u2019d never heard that girl giggle before in your entire goddamn life, and it was almost painful to hear it now considering you had a feeling you knew who it was because of.\u00a0</p><p>Peeking your eye through the little peephole in the door, you were immediately met with Peter and MJ standing in front of Peter\u2019s door. They were both giggling, laughing about something Peter had whispered in MJ\u2019s ear as he was fishing for his key.\u00a0</p><p>MJ went to say something, her fingertips trailing along his elbow, and Peter suddenly turned to look straight at her, no longer laughing as she continued to babble, unaware of his stare.</p><p>You\u2019d seen that stare before. You knew what that meant. Peter had had that stare when he\u2019d hooked up with Melissa Greyson at the end of junior year right before the field trip, and he\u2019d often stared at you that way whenever he thought you wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d MJ laughed, a hushed word escaping her mouth before Peter had her in his arm - his one strong arm looped around her waist as she gasped and looked down at him, obviously shocked.\u00a0\u201cPeter, what -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCan I -?\u201d Peter was obviously nervous, and your heart went out to the kid that he was finally doing something about this crush and yet was completely underwater and over his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d MJ said so quickly it even shocked you. Sure, you\u2019d known she liked the kid, but you\u2019d never pegged MJ as one to beg.\u00a0<br></p><p>His lips met hers and their eyes both closed and suddenly you wanted to turn away and vomit. Of course (because when in life was there not poorly timed conflict) Peter was just going to man up and kiss MJ <i>now</i>.</p><p><i>Of course.</i></p><p>Because you\u2019d told him too.\u00a0</p><p>Knowing that MJ would be coming back to your room probably quite soon after their hasty hallway make out session, you were quick to put all your things away and jump into bed, rushing to flick the light off so it looked like you\u2019d been asleep for longer than the five seconds your heart was hammering in your chest while attempting to lie still.\u00a0</p><p>And when the door finally did open and MJ came in, she of course figured you were asleep. Your back was to her, the lights were out, you had slowed down your rapid breathing enough that it was believable.\u00a0</p><p>She was quick in prepping for bed too, so you didn\u2019t have to worry about blowing your cover for too long.\u00a0</p><p>But what you should have been worried about, and what you hadn\u2019t even thought about in the heat of the moment, was the rapid beating and thundering of your heart, the adrenaline rushing through your body as you\u2019d tossed yourself around the room to prepare for MJ\u2019s entrance.\u00a0</p><p>Because no one else would have ever known you were faking your slumber, heart aching and body screaming to tear the room apart. But even from across the hall, standing in the doorway of his own door wondering if he should follow up or not, Peter\u2019s ears and senses were tuned in to the rapid and steady pounding of your heart against your ribcage.\u00a0</p><p>And though he\u2019d kissed MJ because he wanted to kiss MJ, it still made him feel a bit guilty that though he was happy about the kiss, he was a bit more interested in the fact that your heart pounding through his body had been the highlight of the night.\u00a0</p><p><i>Were you jealous?</i> It was question you were attempting to not think about, and Peter was starting to wonder.\u00a0</p><p>* * *</p><p><b><i>author\u2019s note: that was hella long and i know the timing of things and the countries aren\u2019t all accurate but this isn\u2019t supposed to be accurate to the movie because WHO KNOWS what\u2019s going to happen in the film !\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>regardless, hella angst, flash isn\u2019t that bad of a guy ? and lol @ peter just being like #theworst but also #thebest. i wrote this over the course of like a week and a half, lol, so if y\u2019all want more \u2026 you may have to wait a hot sec. unless there\u2019s just this massive influx of messages (which i know there won\u2019t be hence the setting myself up for success here), then the next update may come in a bit OR not at all lol.</i></b></p><p><b><i>but for those of you who were asking for more, here\u2019s a bit of what would have been to come. i put the intro at the top with the link for those who have not have seen that this is technically part two of a\u00a0\u201cseries\u201d so hope you enjoy it all ! and i\u2019d love to know what you may have to say about my writing/the stories/the character/what you would love to see/what you\u2019d love to know more of ! so i\u2019ll put the feedback link below, along with a link to my ko-fi because ya gurl is a poor af archaeology student trying to survive college and \u2026 four jobs ain\u2019t enough lol.</i></b></p><p><b><i>thanks for all the support ! so freaking kind, every single one of ya.</i></b></p><h2><i><b><a href=\"https://hey-marlie.tumblr.com/ask\">i\u2019m a thirsty narcissistic hoe for feedback plz send me a message</a></b></i></h2><h2><b>donate: <i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2FG2G3J972%23&amp;t=NmMyMWNmNTA3YzYxOTMyMjgxZTVlMWIwYWI0MDY0YmNkZDczZmFiMixTd2dtMnBRdA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Ax66cc1hbY_oRucCuLnQAFw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fhey-marlie.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178706066881%2Fn-o-v-e-l-t-y-ch-5&amp;m=1\">buy marlie b a coffee ?</a></i></b></h2></p>",

The correct foods, the time to take naps, and the amount of water to inhale like you were dying of dehydration.\u00a0</p><p>So it didn\u2019t come as a shock to you when the plane landed and majority of your classmates were walking like slugs through the airport in Rome, while you and Peter had a bit of a pep to your step.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when your dad took us to Rome and didn\u2019t tell us why,\u201d Peter spoke quietly, the only two students close to you both being Ned and MJ, who would know of your escapades already.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You smiled,\u00a0\u201cAnd when we got there he just threw our suits at us and left on the jet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur first mission,\u201d Peter chuckled,\u00a0\u201cAnd your suit malfunctioned and you almost tore me in half.\u201d<br></p><p>He was laughing now, but at the time it was terrifying, and the Italian mafia ring that had - in the words of your dad been\u00a0\u201chardly any competition\u201d - almost gotten away with it when they\u2019d proved to be a far larger threat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d you shook your head,\u00a0\u201cThat was our sophomore year.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter shrugged,\u00a0\u201cThat was before Thor told me I actually needed to work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could lift school buses but hardly had any muscles,\u201d you noted, pinching his forearm.\u00a0\u201cAnd you pulled your groin muscle getting back on the jet. You were hobbling around for a week!\u201d<br></p><p>The two of you were laughing now quite obnoxiously, considering everyone else was quite exhausted and just wanted a quiet subway ride to the train station. But, just like old times, you and Peter were relentless.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCare to share with the class?\u201d Harry asked, sliding his sunglasses onto his face as you all followed Mr. Harrington towards the train station.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust reminiscing about the time Peter sprained his balls,\u201d you smirked, watching as Peter rolled his eyes and slung his arm around your shoulders lazily, leaving you to stagger slightly under his weight.\u00a0<br></p><p>The scrawny boy had bulked up a bit since \u2026 since the initial event \u2026 and as he pulled his phone from his pocket and seemed to be distracted by the screen, you observed his profile closely.</p><p>\u201cStop staring,\u201d Peter mumbled.<br></p><p>\u201cYou just look a bit different,\u201d you shrugged, leaning slightly into his arm as he stopped texted May of his whereabouts and slid his phone into his back pocket once more.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah? Maybe I look the same, you just haven\u2019t seen me in a while.\u201d<br></p><p>The statement was innocent. It was a fact that you\u2019d been taking your summer vacation to yourself, and had opted to finish out the end of your junior year with online courses. So yes, you\u2019d physically been apart.</p><p>But emotionally, you and Peter hadn\u2019t connected in quite some time, and that was something new for the both of you, but only the fault of one of you.</p><p>\u201cYeah well \u2026\u201d you slinked out from under Peter\u2019s arm, clearing your throat and adjusting your backpack,\u00a0\u201cSome of us process things differently.\u201d<br></p><p>You tried to pretend you didn\u2019t see the slight pain in Peter\u2019s eyes when you pulled yourself away from him. Just the momentary and innocent touch of his arm around your shoulders made you feel more at ease - even in a train station in Rome - than you had in months.</p><p>But comfort led to complacency, and you felt the need to be more alert and aware.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright well, what fancy hotel am I going to be crashing in for the next week?\u201d Flash called towards Mr. Harrington, who seemed to be completely preoccupied by every map around him that he obviously couldn\u2019t read. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute that you think you\u2019re going to be staying in some fancy digs, there, Eugene,\u201d you stated, watching as Ned snickered slightly and Betty gave you a beaming look. </p><p>You and Betty had never really been friends. She\u2019d asked you countless times if she could interview you for their morning news show and each time you\u2019d declined. You were pretty sure Peter had talked to her about it at one point after you\u2019d ranted to him about \u201cnot having any privacy at this stupid school\u201d because she soon stopped and Peter was suddenly giving a report on the photojournalism work he was doing and how he\u2019d gotten a snap of Spider-Man.</p><p>What a narcissist. </p><p>\u201cI paid to be here,\u201d Flash whined, \u201cJust give me a bed.\u201d</p><p>The bed Flash did end up getting was in a run-down looking hotel where the lobby smelled like corn chips and the man sitting behind the counter looked like he belonged in some sort of episode of <i>The Series of Unfortunate Events.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThis \u2026 is \u2026?\u201d Harry was at a loss for words as Peter pushed past him politely and set his suitcase down on a table. You watched him hesitantly as he fiddled with the handle and talked under his breath to MJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>The suitcase was something you\u2019d never seen before. It was quite large, and never was what Peter would take when the two of you traveled for your dad\u2019s trips. He usually brought along a smaller carry on that was definitely Aunt May\u2019s, considering the faded pink flowers and the floral name tag.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d never really said anything about it, and you know your dad had never mentioned it either. But you do know that your dad had bought Peter a whole set of luggage to use. So the fact that he wasn\u2019t using any of it \u2026 you weren\u2019t sure what exactly to say.\u00a0</p><p>But then you noticed the little engraving as Peter continued to fiddle absentmindedly with the handle without even looking as he and MJ continued their conversation.\u00a0</p><p><i>BFP.</i></p><p>Benjamin Franklin Parker.</p><p>You sucked in a breath at the realization that Peter was using his uncle Ben\u2019s old luggage. It made your heart warm and your body fill with little tingles as you noticed he never full let go of his luggage. God, what a goddamn cutie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay class,\u201d Mr. Harrington attempted to cut off the multiple conversations going on all at once, and you simply sat back in your seat next to Harry, who was on his phone, and watched as everyone slowly started to pay attention to your teacher.<br></p><p>\u201cRoom assignments,\u201d he held up multiple keys,\u00a0\u201cCome and collect your keys and key card with the wifi password and find your roommate.\u201d<br></p><p>It was like an odd mad dash for everyone to scramble to find the key with their name on it scribbled on the paper with the number. It didn\u2019t take long for you to find yours, or, in your case, for Peter to hand yours to you as he was shuffling through them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s you and me, girl,\u201d MJ said, twiddling her key between her fingers.\u00a0\u201cGotta say, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s you.\u201d<br></p><p>You simply nodded, unsure what to say in a situation like this. So you decided on,\u00a0\u201cThanks. Me too.\u201d</p><p>The room was small, and Ned and Peter watched from their room on the other side of the hall as you and MJ attempted to get the closet doors open.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d you simply stated, too tired to attempt to try. MJ was already flopped over on the bed, and you both seemed to come to the realization that if you were ever going to open this rusty old closet door (that probably held a body) then you were going to need someone who could lift an entire bus with one hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter opened it easily, a smirk on his face as MJ flipped him off and you simply shoved him out of the way to toss your things inside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys want to go out and explore? We have the entire afternoon to go out on our own before dinner tonight.\u201d Peter looked amongst the four of you as he awaited a response, obviously not prepared for everyone to want to take a nap once immediately landing in a new and foreign country.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude, we\u2019re jet lagged,\u201d Ned snorted,\u00a0\u201cYou honestly think I want to go out on a tour right now? We\u2019re going out tomorrow.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m good,\u201d MJ yawned,\u00a0\u201cGotta prep for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>You watched as Peter started to deflate, fiddling with the ends of his hoodie strings as he sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not jet lagged.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRich people,\u201d MJ mumbled, shooting you a playful smirk as you stuck your tongue out at her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you back gelato,\u201d you promised, before grabbing your backpack and following Peter out into the hallway.\u00a0<br></p><p>You passed Harry in the hallway where he was looking at something on his phone with Flash while you and Peter attempted to make your way by.</p><p>\u201cGuys look at this.\u201d He nearly shoved his phone into your faces as Peter squinted - a lot of light too fast - and you grasped it from him to get a better look.\u00a0<br></p><p>It was a video going viral on YouTube of some huge sandstorm in what seemed to be Libya.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you asked, squinting slightly as Peter looked over your shoulder as you got a better look at the shaky footage.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a typical sandstorm. It was what seemed to be a giant being? If you could call it that. You felt Peter\u2019s breath on your throat, causing you to grip the phone a bit tighter considering the proximity of which it was bringing Peter closer to you.\u00a0<br></p><p>Buildings were being swept up, cars being flattened, and you didn\u2019t even want to think of what had happened to the people had there been any large masses anywhere close.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSome crazy anomaly in Libya,\u201d Harry said excited,\u00a0\u201cIt straight up looks like a man.\u201d</p><p>You took the liberty of sending the link to the video to your phone, feeling the vibration in your pocket before handing it back to Harry. Flash was silent, as if gauging your reaction to what you\u2019d just seen. It was this freaky next-level bullshit that you knew used to be an Avengers project, but with the way things were now \u2026 no Tony. No Cap. Well \u2026 you weren\u2019t sure what the protocol was.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Peter offered, casually and calmly taking your hand in his as the two of you made your way towards the lobby.\u00a0<br></p><p>It was a nice sunny day, which you hadn\u2019t had in a while, and so you placed your sunglasses on your head in delight as the two of you decided to make your way towards the nearest cafe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI sent the video to myself,\u201d you told Peter as the two of you sat down and ordered some pizza. Well, you both ordered your own pizzas but you knew Peter would be eating close to both of them, saving you probably two or three slices.\u00a0<br></p><p>You pulled out your phone and watched as the hologram of the video produced itself between the two of you.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N, we don\u2019t need to watch this,\u201d Peter sighed, nearly inhaling another piece of pizza into his mouth and holding his water glass as if his life depended on it.<br></p><p>\u201cI caught this though,\u201d you pointed out, zooming in on the video - something you couldn\u2019t have done on Harry\u2019s iPhone, and freezing the video on two figures that had been standing off to the side of the shot. Too small to be seen on any regular viewing - but with some enhancing and fancy Stark tech well \u2026<br></p><p>It was obvious to you that Maria Hill and Nick Fury were on the scene.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s S.H.I.E.L.D.,\u201d you motioned to Fury as Peter squinted and turned the screen to get a better view himself.<br></p><p>\u201cYep. Sure is,\u201d he mumbled, going back to his next slice.\u00a0\u201cGood for them.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to call Happy and ask about this?\u201d you raised an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cNot going to ask me to call either?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/N, we\u2019re on vacation,\u201d Peter sighed,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re in Venice. We\u2019re eating pizza. We haven\u2019t hung out in four months. Can\u2019t you just take this time and appreciate it for what it is without having to look outside the situation to find something else?\u201d<br></p><p>You stared at Peter, simply blinking and wondering what kind of comeback you were going to have.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring the suit,\u201d Peter continued, then winced,\u00a0\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t pack the suit with any thought of being Spider-Man here. May was the one that tucked it in there last minute. Nearly blew my cover through customs.\u201d<br></p><p>You chuckled at this, knowing the Peter Parker Panic Face all too well.\u00a0</p><p>There was something surreal about being here with Peter and just relaxing. You couldn\u2019t remember the last time you\u2019d felt this at ease. He was looking over across San Marco square and just sipping his water like the pretty boy he was, and you were sitting here not focusing on him and God, that was a crime.</p><p>You turned your phone off and cleared your throat,\u00a0\u201cSo \u2026 you and MJ.\u201d</p><p>Peter choked on his water, doubling over slightly as he wiped his mouth on his flannel and looked over at you questionably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou and Michelle Jones,\u201d you smirked,\u00a0\u201cI can see it. I\u2019ll have to gossip with Ned later. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s head of the fan club.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo - Y/N, no. That\u2019s not -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d you shrugged, cutting him off because really, you did not want to hear the explanation.\u00a0\u201cYou two have always been close. You both went through a lot together, so I can understand the connection.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter scoffed and leaned back in his chair,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together and we aren\u2019t going to date.\u201d</p><p>You broke your straw just like that, one flick of your fingers and it snapped as Peter stared at you with wide eyes.\u00a0\u201cYou okay?\u201d he chuckled.</p><p><i>No I\u2019m not fucking okay. Love me!</i> you screamed, internally, where your broken and selfish heart was having a bitch-fit to break free from the cage you\u2019d put around it. Your heart just couldn\u2019t stay in its fucking lane.</p><p>You composed yourself and shrugged,\u00a0\u201cWhy are you suddenly lying to me? Just be honest. Do you have feelings for MJ?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated and it was then that you knew you were toast. You were the butt end of a loaf of bread that got stuck in the toaster after being put off for days because no one really wanted you, but you were the only option left.\u00a0</p><p>But Peter wasn\u2019t yours. Peter may have been yours at one point when the two of you were thick as thieves, running around the compound and attempting to make your dad laugh whenever you tried out new gadgets and blasted the Inspector Gadget theme song hopped up on energy drinks.\u00a0</p><p>He was yours when you\u2019d lay awake at night talking about things that had always bothered the two of you about growing up so young in an atmosphere the Avengers had pulled you into.</p><p>He\u2019d been yours every time he smiled in your direction at school or slid into the bench at lunch next to you, or cheered whenever Happy would allow either of you to drive the fancy car that would pick you up from school.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d been yours for a night once. But the thought had your whole body seemingly bursting into flames and aching as if being probed intensely under the brightest and harshest of lights.\u00a0</p><p>But now, sitting across from him in Venice where your toes were touching and Peter was looking like sunshine behind his sunglasses, and you were sitting in your favorite cardigan with one and a half pizzas eaten between you \u2026 you knew Peter wasn\u2019t yours anymore.</p><p>Four months was a long time. One sunny day in Venice couldn\u2019t change anything.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone through a lot,\u201d Peter sighed, pulling you back into the conversation.\u00a0\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve all been through a lot. But uh \u2026\u201d Peter sighed and ruffled his hair,\u00a0\u201cShe took it like a champ. The therapy, the new job \u2026 she had Mr. Delmar smiling every day when she\u2019d arrive for work, you know? And she\u2019s always been proud and confident, but she\u2019s been more caring and aware of the student body since everything has happened and honestly? I\u2019ve been impressed.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter shrugged, as if his declaration would mean anything less.\u00a0</p><p>A breeze washed over the two of you and you caught a whiff of his scent - the mix of cologne and boyish charm you\u2019ve always associated with Peter since you\u2019d met him.</p><p>You wondered sometimes what your smell was like to him. Well, you at least tried not to think about that anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go for it?\u201d you encouraged.\u00a0<br></p><p>You weren\u2019t a <i>bitch</i>. Well, okay yeah you <i>definitely</i> were a bitch. But you\u2019d never been a bitch by default. That was a hard exterior you\u2019d built up over the years prior to meeting Peter, and since he\u2019d come into your life like the who goddamn sun that he was - not even just a ray of sunshine - he had been slowly chipping away at that persona to find the happy sunshine girl underneath that you\u2019d always been.\u00a0</p><p>But you were never and will never be a bitch to your friends - especially Peter. And if helping Peter find someone that would take care of him and be there for him and take the time to understand him \u2026 then fuck it, you were Team MJ more than even Ned Leeds probably was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend, Y/N, I can\u2019t just \u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe likes you,\u201d you scoffed, rolling your eyes and shoving your sunglasses down your face so you could look Peter more aggressively in the eyes.\u00a0\u201cI know I\u2019ve been gone for a while, but that girl has liked you for ages, and she seems to be smitten with you now more than ever.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter\u2019s blushing, and you would continue to push him until he\u2019d just admit his feelings, if you didn\u2019t see some of your school group over his shoulder making their way towards you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell well well,\u201d you chuckled, sitting up straighter and shoving your glasses back on your face as the MJ in question plopped down next to Peter and grabbed his water glass from him, chugging it.\u00a0<br></p><p>You smirked as Peter looked at her obviously in shock, and she seemed to not be in the mood to look his way.\u00a0\u201cTired,\u201d she grumbled, reaching over for a slice of pizza still left.</p><p>\u201cThose beds are not \u2026 comfortable,\u201d Ned grumbled,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how Betty is still sleeping.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou just miss your super nice therapeutic mattress,\u201d you joked,\u00a0\u201cYou still have that right? Storm Trooper sheets and all?\u201d<br></p><p>Ned laughed and swatted at your arm lazily, sitting back in his chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it like being back in the land of the living?\u201d Harry asked you, sitting down on your other side and wrapping his arm around the back of your seat.\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry was a nice kid. Harry could be fun. Harry would make for a great distraction for the whole Peter and MJ thing that you were sure was happening. So you leaned into his touch.</p><p>Sighing, you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cMuch more lively than throwing darts and shooting guns at targets all day with Nat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that you casually name drop the Black Widow,\u201d Harry snorted and shook his head,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, girl.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell she has been hanging out with Black Widow,\u201d MJ pointed out, smirking towards you with a flicker of admiration.\u00a0<br></p><p>Girls were so fucking petty. You knew you got lucky when you realized the only person who you may ever have to compete for attention from Peter was MJ. She was so chill and like a goddamn queen with her intellect, looks, and wit. Hell, you always told yourself that if Peter and MJ did end up together, at least you\u2019d know you\u2019d have a super cool friend for life along with Peter.</p><p>So why it was irking you so much that Peter was staring at MJ\u2019s profile - moments after you\u2019d suggested he just go for it\u00a0 - well \u2026 girls are petty.\u00a0</p><p>When dinner came, you were all herded towards an older restaurant that you were pretty sure you were only going to because Mr. Harrington had read five thousand reviews on Yelp. He kept using words you were sure he wasn\u2019t familiar with when it came to the culinary craft, and it seemed he was the only one excited.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to eat my weight in pasta,\u201d Flash smoothed out his blazer as you patted his shoulder. You weren\u2019t sure when it started, considering you\u2019d only really been back with these kids for about a day and a half, but Flash was suddenly hovering around you in an oddly protective manner.<br></p><p>Considering the kind words he\u2019d shared with you at the airport, and then the fact that he\u2019d been quiet and respectful whenever you\u2019d talked since, made you wonder if maybe Flash really was trying to be a better person instead of the attention-seeking prideful bully you\u2019d known him to be in the past.\u00a0</p><p>But then he shoved Peter as you were all walking into the restaurant and you couldn\u2019t help but want to shove him into the Venice canals and run him over with a gondola.\u00a0</p><p>The meal was just fine, considering everyone was starving and the jet lag was starting to kick in so everyone was rowdy. You\u2019d never been abroad with a group of students before, only ever with your dad, and the closest you\u2019d ever come to a European vacation was when you and Peter finished your mission in Rome by highjacking the jet that was sent for you and spending a long weekend in Monte Carlo.\u00a0</p><p>You shuddered just thinking about it.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone was lagging by the time Mr. Harrington started to drag you all to the cinema to watch some Italian film based off a book you were all supposed to read. The only one to actually read it was MJ, and even she didn\u2019t want to see the film, but \u2026 that\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter cleared his throat and placed his hands together, pointing at you with both his hands. It made you smile, because it was something your dad used to do and a bit of a joke that you and Peter had picked up to mess with him. And now seeing Peter do it gave you this odd feeling of home, mixed with a bit of guilt and regret \u2026 but mostly home.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay indeed,\u201d you nodded, sauntering along with MJ, Ned, and Betty in the back of the group as everyone followed a very confused teacher who was bad at maps.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s place bets. Who are we thinking tonight?\u201d MJ asked, skipping from one stone to the next with calculated precision and balance.\u00a0\u201cObviously I want to put ten on Bets and Nedd-o.\u201d<br></p><p>Ned rolled his eyes,\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019re a couple! You can\u2019t place bets on us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d Betty looked around, obviously confused considering the conversation was completely and ridiculously immature, but tradition.<br></p><p>\u201cWhenever we watch films in school the four of us would usually place bets on who would get with who -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhom,\u201d you corrected Peter. He rolled his eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cOh who would get with whom,\u201d he shot you a look,\u00a0\u201cwhile the lights were out. And considering Mr. Harrington has us watch a lot of films, the four of us have made some good money over the years.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou and Stevie Preston got me fifty bucks,\u201d you told Betty.<br></p><p>\u201cI still have no idea how you got that one,\u201d MJ groaned,\u00a0\u201cWhy did you cuddle with Stevie anyway? His posture is atrocious and he\u2019s always talking about his bug collection.\u201d<br></p><p>Betty looked confused,\u00a0\u201cWell, that day specifically he was wearing this jacket that smelled really nice like lavender, and that\u2019s my favorite smell and he told me he liked my new green brooch so \u2026 I don\u2019t know. I was feeling sentimental,\u201d Betty shrugged.\u00a0\u201cObviously a one time thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Peter grumbled,\u00a0\u201cYou and Stevie Preston cost me fifty bucks.\u201d</p><p>You patted Peter\u2019s cheek happily before laughing.\u00a0\u201cIt was simple, really,\u201d you shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI manufactured the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d MJ shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo really,\u201d you smiled,\u00a0\u201cI knew Betty liked the smell of lavender considering the hand lotion you always use after gym class before we went to lunch. And Stevie is always one for getting cold - he never wears a jacket - and that morning when I noticed he was chilly, I handed over one of Peter\u2019s old hoodies he\u2019d left at my place ages ago that I\u2019d put lavender perfume on. Then, I noticed the pride you had in your new brooch, Bets, so I simply commented on it in the presence of Stevie, who obviously had a crush on you, and mentioned how people don\u2019t notice nice things like that anymore and girls like when guys notice those things. So \u2026 Stevie comments on your brooch and smells like lavender and BOOM I manufactured love.\u201d<br></p><p>No one said anything as you continued to walk, but all of them clearly looked dumbstruck. There was a mix of fear and awe in Peter\u2019s eyes, which turned into pride as he broke out into a smile.\u00a0\u201cAnd then you out of the blue bet me fifty knowing that it would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also knew you had fifty because my dad paid you the day before and I knew I wanted to go to that thai place for dinner and I could get you to go if I had the money to do so. Which, prior to our bet, I did not.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou two are seriously twisted,\u201d Ned shook his head,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like you feed off one another. I bet your murders take half the time to plan when you decide to go in on it together.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes as Peter laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll bet Jon and Samantha will at least make out once,\u201d MJ cleared her throat,\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ve been secretly hooking up all summer.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d Peter asked, twisting his body slightly to look back at where MJ was trailing behind him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause they never stand farther than arm\u2019s length apart. That means at least something,\u201d MJ rolled her eyes.<br></p><p>You watched as Peter\u2019s eyes traveled from his arm to yours, noticing the short distance between the two of you before he attempted to hesitantly shift away a bit farther.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell how much and against whom are you betting then?\u201d you asked.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say a solid fifteen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWeak.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLogical,\u201d MJ countered.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso weak,\u201d you snickered.<br></p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Peter laughed, pushing you slightly as you bat childishly at his hand.<br></p><p>\u201cGod stop flirting and just make out in a closet somewhere already,\u201d Ned joked. Three separate interactions took place where you shot Ned a look, Peter immediately looked away from you while blushing, and MJ went a bit rigid, looking down at her feet.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a bet,\u201d you said, turning and walking backwards so you could get a good look at everyone\u2019s faces.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer allowed,\u201d MJ stuck her tongue out at you, the prior Ned comment having passed within the length of five paces.\u00a0\u201cYou manufacture love. That\u2019s cheating.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t have anything on me now to do so, now do I?\u201d you asked, opening your arms as if to prove a point.<br></p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Peter cocked his head slightly, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had a lot of points, but she\u2019s still a cheater,\u201d MJ shrugged,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m vetoing your bet.\u201d<br></p><p>You huffed,\u00a0\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll place one,\u201d Betty spoke up, a bit timid.\u00a0</p><p>Betty was a smart girl, there was no denying that. Her drive and spunk gave her an upper hand on majority of the school. She was going to be an ace reporter one day, that was for sure, but in the midst of three geniuses - you, Peter and MJ - well, anyone would be a bit timid when trying to impress your boyfriend\u2019s best friends.<br></p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you cheered,\u00a0\u201cNow this is getting interesting! Place your bets, Bets.\u201d<br></p><p>A bit of a pink blush tinted Betty\u2019s cheeks as she spoke,\u00a0\u201cI bet twenty euros that Flash will try to make out with Y/N during the film.\u201d</p><p>Oxygen seemed to funnel from the group as everyone remained silent long enough for their shock to cling to every fiber of their bones. No one had bet on you before, minus the first three times that Ned had bet MJ that you and Peter would lean in and cuddle at some point.\u00a0</p><p>But that was a given, and Ned and MJ had quickly grown tired of losing their money to one another.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFlash?\u201d you stumbled slightly from walking backwards and Peter was quick to catch you, straightening you out as you cleared your throat.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s some big talk there Bets.\u201d<br></p><p>Betty shrugged,\u00a0\u201cEveryone can see he\u2019s been trying to make a move since you got back. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he and Harry are secretly fighting over you. Flash has always had something for you, we all know it, and if Harry give you one more look while you\u2019re not looking at him then he might die right then and there.\u201d</p><p>You were blushing now, feeling a deep warmth splinter through your entire body.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d was all you said before turning back around and swiftly doing your best to keep up with the group.<br></p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d Betty asked, watching your retreating figure as Peter nibbled on his bottom lip. Betty wasn\u2019t the only one that had noticed Flash\u2019s interest in you, or the way Harry\u2019s stare had lingered everywhere you go since you\u2019d returned to the living. It had made his skin crawl with an uncomfortable feeling settling in the tips of his fingers that itched to grasp you as tight as he could and hide you away from prying eyes.<br></p><p>But that wasn\u2019t his job.</p><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t,\u201d MJ said, coming up a bit closer so her shoulder brushed against Peter\u2019s as they walked,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s just a bit sensitive to \u2026 relationships, I think. It\u2019s never really been her thing.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRelationships?\u201d Betty furrowed her eyebrows, obviously confused.</p><p>\u201cEmotional commitment,\u201d MJ corrected.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell I wonder why,\u201d Peter mumbled, more to himself, but MJ looked to him and he could tell she was struggling to figure out a way to explain you to others that wouldn\u2019t sound like she was judging. MJ meant well, and Peter appreciated that.<br></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll take that bet, baby,\u201d Ned said, grasping Betty\u2019s hand and squeezing it tight. Betty smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>As everyone filed into the cinema, you plopped down in the middle, ready for Peter to find a seat next to you and allow you to toss your legs across his lap. But instead, Flash - speak of the devil - sat down next to you and adjusted himself so he was more lounging than sitting.</p><p>\u201cYou read this?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d you rolled your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah you did.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash looked at you as you let out a long huff through your nose, turning and facing him, locking eyes in a challenging way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Fine</i>. Maybe I did.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash smiled.\u00a0\u201cSee, you can pretend you don\u2019t care about all this literature and history and art. You\u2019re a science kid through and through - I get that. But you also aced all our art history tests last spring term, and you even won our history essay contest. This shit excites you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018<i>This shit</i>,\u2019\u201d you snorted,\u00a0\u201cNice.\u201d<br></p><p>Betty and Ned settled down in front of you, Betty looking over her shoulder to give you a quick, bold suggestive look. You smirked. Leaning forward, you placed your head between Ned and Betty, clearing your throat for attention.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will bet you both fifty bucks that by the end of tonight, Peter and MJ will make out.\u201d<br></p><p>Ned nearly spit out all his water as Betty gasped so loudly that everyone turned to see if she was alright. You locked eyes with Peter, from where he and MJ were sitting a bit off to the side, two rows in front of Ned and Betty. You winked at him and made a little kissy face before turning your attention back to Betty and Ned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you accept my bet?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Hell yeah</i> I accept your bet,\u201d Ned laughed, turning to face you,\u00a0\u201cI would love fifty bucks.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re about to lose it, so cherish it now,\u201d you winked before sitting back in your seat.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Flash asked, tossing some popcorn in his mouth. You leaned over and helped yourself, chewing slowly as you thought.<br></p><p>\u201cI just bet Betty and Ned each fifty bucks that Peter and MJ would be making out by the end of tonight.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash stared at you, a bit dumbfounded, as he finally broke out into a low chuckle.\u00a0\u201cYeah right. You\u2019d sell all your secrets to the media before allowing MJ to kiss your man.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Turning to look at Flash, you could tell in his smug expression that the rise he\u2019d gotten out of you was exactly what he was hoping for.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, <i>come on</i> Y/N,\u201d Flash chuckled and turned to face you a bit more as the lights dimmed for the film.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t honestly expect me to have been in the same classroom as you and Dr. Prodigy over there for the past four years and not see clear as day that you are <i>obviously</i> in love with him.\u201d<br></p><p>You blinked, giving yourself some time to process this, as you reached out and grabbed some more popcorn.\u00a0\u201cStupid,\u201d was the only remark you could think to utter.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I was there when you found out that Peter had \u2026\u201d Flash trailed off and cleared his throat,\u00a0\u201cYou <i>punched</i> a security guard right in the <i>face</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe lost a lot of people. I thought my dad had also died then,\u201d you recalled.</p><p>Flash rolled his eyes and adjusted the popcorn on his lap so it was more centered towards you, the one who was obviously going to be eating more of it.\u00a0\u201cYou can say whatever you want, Y/N, but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are stupid.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not <i>that</i> stupid,\u201d Flash quipped back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to love him, you know. Like, he\u2019s a nerd and a <i>total loser</i> but I bet you guys have a lot of fun with the internship. Having access to that kind of tech \u2026 I mean, hell yeah I can see where the whole friends to lovers situation blossomed in your little stone cold heart.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in denial,\u201d Flash shrugged.<br></p><p>\u201cI want Peter to be happy,\u201d you hissed, attempting to not take away from the film.\u00a0\u201cAnd MJ makes him happy.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash shrugged,\u00a0\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attempting to speak it into existence, <i>sure</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>Flash was sitting there smug, watching the film and sighing,\u00a0\u201cThese subtitles are wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Italian.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes actually, I <i>do</i> speak Italian.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou speak Italian?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Oh my God</i> are you deaf?\u201d<br></p><p>You and Flash looked at one another for a moment as he smirked, his eyes twinkling as he was obviously enjoying this conversation. You couldn\u2019t believe that resident idiot Flash Thompson was actually \u2026 observant \u2026 and smart?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d you laughed lightly, shaking your head and sinking down in your seat to be on Flash\u2019s level.</p><p>\u201cNumber one bully, you know that,\u201d Flash shrugged.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh my God. Are you one of those angsty art kids that is super good at science and maths but secretly wants to be the next Vincent van Gogh?\u201d<br></p><p>Flash rolled his eyes,\u00a0\u201cI only know you aced all your art history exams because you\u2019re the only one that got higher marks than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Holy shit</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Flash nodded.\u00a0<br></p><p>You actually watched the rest of the film. And considering you had read the book, listening to the Italian and enjoying the subtitles and plot twists was more thrilling considering you had a familiarity for the story. And, somehow without your knowledge, you\u2019d slowly found yourself leaning against Flash as the two of you shared the rest of his popcorn.\u00a0</p><p>His arm was warm, and the kind of arm that was comfortable to lean your head on instead of the back of the cinema seats.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d you learn Italian?\u201d you asked at some point in the film.<br></p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s Italian.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>No shit</i>.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know. Crazy.\u201d<br></p><p>The fact that Flash seemed to just kind of be unimpressed with his own existence was interesting to you, and a bit intriguing, and you really figured that maybe this whole bullying thing was coming from his own disinterest in his own life - a cry for help? If you will?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d Flash shrugged,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no more popcorn.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get more. I know what happens; I\u2019ve read the book,\u201d you joked, grabbing the bucket and making your way towards the lobby.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo \u2026 you feel bad for Betty or something? Trying to make her some extra cash?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You turned to see Peter standing there, close-lipped awkward smile on his face and two empty drink cups in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting MJ a refill? Nice. Very date material,\u201d you winked, wiggling your shoulders in a bit of a shimmy before turning back to the concessions and handing them the bucket.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you bet Ned and Betty that MJ and I would make out?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Wow, fuck super hearing. Of course.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d you mumbled, closing your eyes and turning back around to see Peter waiting there intently.<br></p><p>He gave you another close-lipped smile, letting out a long breath of air through his nose,\u00a0\u201cWell now I\u2019m just getting mixed signals,\u201d he joked,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re telling <i>others</i> I\u2019m going to make out with MJ and now you\u2019re telling <i>me</i> to fuck you? Mixed signals, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth there, Petey,\u201d you wiggled your finger,\u00a0\u201cThey can hear you now.\u201d<br></p><p>You pointed up to the heavens, knowing that the joke was may be a bit too soon, but also knowing that Peter had always known you as the joking type.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hide behind your jokes</i>, <i>Y/N</i>, you thought to yourself, <i>and maybe this cute boy won\u2019t realize you\u2019re in love with him.</i></p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Peter sighed now, admitting his lack of understanding of the situation.\u00a0\u201c<i>Flash</i>? Really, Y/N?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid you know he speaks Italian?\u201d you asked him,\u00a0\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t. Yeah he\u2019s a fucking idiot and kind of a bully, but he\u2019s <i>listening</i> to me, Peter, and he\u2019s having a <i>real</i> conversation with me. Not a Stark conversation where he\u2019s too reserved to ask certain things, but he\u2019s seeing me as just another classmate.\u201d<br></p><p>You shrugged as Peter handed the concessions guy the drinks and rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cIf he was <i>really</i> treating you like his other classmates then he <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> be hitting on you. He\u2019d be making fun of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re being honest here, I think he has more of a crush on you than anyone else,\u201d you shrugged, leaning against the counter and popping some popcorn in your mouth.\u00a0\u201cYou are his main target of interest when it comes to bullying.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe has a thing for Spider-Man,\u201d Peter chuckled.<br></p><p>\u201cWe did find his Twitter account that one time, this is true,\u201d you nodded thoughtfully.\u00a0\u201cSo,<i> if anything</i>, he\u2019s using me as a way to get to Spider-Man. You should be flattered.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter took the drinks back and looked at you straight on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Europe. I\u2019m here having fun with my friends. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d you asked,\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re here having fun with your friends, and I\u2019m back, so I can help you with your girl issues. I really think MJ likes you. Why won\u2019t you just make a move?\u201d<br></p><p>Peter didn\u2019t say anything as he just stared at you, his face hard and his senses a bit on the fritz as he felt the need to slam the drinks against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to do something stupid?\u201d he asked you, barely a whisper as you stopped from where the two of you had started to make your way back to the cinema.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid if I decide to do it. I\u2019m a Stark. We only make good decisions,\u201d you winked.<br></p><p><i>Wrong</i>. History had <i>definitely</i> proven that wrong.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter\u2019s tone was a bit colder than you were used to. It stopped you in your tracks as you turned to see he was holding the cups rather tightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you going out and making any rash decisions because you\u2019re hurting,\u201d Peter said sternly,\u00a0\u201cLast time -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Last time you weren\u2019t here</i>,\u201d you hissed, cutting him off and stepping up as close to him as you could get. Your chests were practically touching as you stared him down, challenging him to turn away.<br></p><p>You\u2019d never been as extravagant with you drugs and alcohol and partying as your dad had been. It was probably because you had known the man he was once that was all over, and you had aspired to be like that man. But when Peter was gone \u2026 when he\u2019d \u2026 <i>left</i> \u2026 God, that had hurt you more than anything else in this world and it had prompted you to be a bit more reckless in all aspects of your life - school, crime fighting, drugs and recreation. Rhodey had gone insane looking after you.\u00a0</p><p>But in your defense, you\u2019d lost Peter twice.\u00a0</p><p><i>You first lost Peter when he left in the space ship, leaving you behind without so much as a strong hold on your hand as his lips pressed to the back of your hand, his eyebrows furrowed together tightly as he clung to you, knowing that this could be the last time he\u2019d see you.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019d been really sick when he left, or else you would have left with him. You\u2019d gone on a mission not two weeks before that and contracted some sort of chemical reaction to the lab you\u2019d crashed. It had left you frail and tired, but with your dad on the case, he\u2019d found a solution rather quickly. It was only a matter of time to heal.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Peter had swung through the window of the hospital wing, sticking to it when he landed and then tipping it open so he could topple in.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cHi hey listen quickly,\u201d he said, stumbling over to you as he worked to get his suit on. He\u2019d been on a field trip - a field trip you really hadn\u2019t been too sad to miss, if you were being honest - and you knew that he\u2019d come back here probably to get some more web fluid before going back out.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d you asked, attempting to sit up but Peter was quick to push you back down and make sure you were tucked in tightly.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo no stop. Y/N, listen.\u201d His words were rushed, and you could see some panic in his eyes as he cleared his throat and grasped your hand.\u00a0\u201cI gotta go.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat? Where? Where\u2019s my dad?\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s - it\u2019s a thing. I don\u2019t know but some - in the sky? I just needed -\u201d he held up the web fluid and continued to attempt to catch his breath.\u00a0\u201cI gotta go,\u201d he whispered, as if that explained everything.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cIn the sky? What thing?\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cSpace ship,\u201d Peter whispered, grasping your hand even tighter in both of his. He looked down at it, smoothing his thumb over the back of your hand that wasn\u2019t connected to an IV and cleared his throat, letting out a long breath.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI gotta go,\u201d he mumbled again, bending down and kissing your hand strongly. You could feel his breath on your wrist from his nose, the shakiness of his hands starting to make you a bit nervous.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, stepping back as if making himself leave you.\u00a0\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded again before groaning and stepping back over to you and pressing his lips now to your forehead, running one hand through your hair as he did so.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWell \u2026 be safe?\u201d\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>You didn\u2019t know the weight of the situation. You\u2019d seen Peter shaken like this before, but things had always turned out okay. When you\u2019d been exposed to the chemical formula, your dad had nearly had to punch Peter unconscious to keep him from tearing off the scientists\u2019 head. Peter\u2019s anger issues started around the time he met you, but you\u2019d always been able to keep him under check.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Peter nodded, gulping slightly and holding his mask. It was then you could see it in his eyes that he was scared - far more scared than he had ever been - and you started to sit up.<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d you said sternly, starting to reach for the IV in your hand and in your arm but you felt the wet and cold snap of Peter\u2019s webbing hitting your hand, solidifying you to the bed.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cPETE -\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. God I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peter almost looked terrified of himself and what he\u2019d done as you struggled against the webbing,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Y/N. I gotta go.\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>And then he was gone.\u00a0</i></p><p>That was the first time you lost Peter Parker - when he left you there in the hospital wing and didn\u2019t come back. And when people started disintegrating around you, there was a part of you that always <i>knew</i> Peter was gone. Peter was with your dad and he was in space and he was gone - they were both gone.\u00a0</p><p>But then you got the distress call from your dad and your pain subsided immediately. Your dad and Peter were <i>alive</i>, and Cap went with you to the ship to greet them.\u00a0</p><p>To greet, you quickly learned, a party of one.</p><p>And though every fiber in your bones was crying out that your dad was back and he was safe, there was only one look that your dad had to give you and a,\u00a0\u201cHe wanted me to say -\u201d before you felt as though you were being torn apart. Cap was beside himself with remorse at your response and had to carry you back to the jet, sedating you for the flight back so you would just <i>stop screaming</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, staring at Peter now in a cinema in Venice after four long months of longing to be near him and not know how \u2026 there was no way Peter would ever know that he was your greatest weakness.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything stupid,\u201d you told him,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> lashing out. I\u2019m exploring my options with a boy who I think likes me and sees me and could be a great distraction on this trip.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter cleared his throat, taking a step back and looking past you, away from your gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d was all he said before he walked back inside in front of you, making his way over to where MJ was watching the film intently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat took <i>ages</i>,\u201d Flash groaned, grabbing the popcorn from you as you chuckled, flicking at his popped collar.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the line,\u201d you lied easily, looking over to see Peter handing MJ her drink before hesitantly slipping an arm around the back of her chair, settling in as she molded herself against him.<br></p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d Flash whistled under his breath,\u00a0\u201cYou might win your bet.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEasy money,\u201d you grumbled, turning back to the popcorn and remaining silent the rest of the film.\u00a0<br></p><p>When the film was over and you were all filing out, Peter and MJ were the last ones out considering they were sitting the closest to the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d MJ asked, a bit weary to ask.<br></p><p>Peter hummed and rubbed his eyes, adjusting the jacket he was wearing and shaking his head as if to shake out the conversation he\u2019d had with you. You were standing over by Flash and Harry and another girl from your class that Peter had always thought was nice. The two of you, he remembered, had worked on an English assignment together once and you\u2019d said she was quite bright.\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019d chosen a simple black dress that tied in the back with small white polka dots for the cinema, with your wedges that had the red straps that wrapped up around your ankle. You looked beautiful with your matching red lipstick and hair pulled back into a low ponytail - strategic stray hairs framing your face.\u00a0</p><p>Peter huffed, turning back to MJ and seeing she was watching him intently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty,\u201d he commented, meaning every word.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTherefore I have value?\u201d MJ smirked, seemingly unimpressed with the statement.<br></p><p>And Peter panicked.\u00a0</p><p>He had to give MJ credit where credit was due. <i>MJ</i> had been the one to be there for him when they\u2019d all returned. <i>She</i> was the one who had come over to his house when he had nightmares, or allow him to rant for hours after a particularly bad patrol. <i>She</i> was the one who had been there for him all these months as <i>you\u2019d</i>\u00a0been the one to lock yourself away.\u00a0</p><p>And in that time, yeah, Peter had to be honest, he\u2019d started to develop feelings for MJ. It would be nice, he would admit, to see where they would go because he knew MJ\u2019s heart beat quickened whenever he was around her, and that she was particularly more twitchy whenever he was close.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t rocket science. And even rocket science was easy for Peter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d MJ quickly said, noticing Peter\u2019s large eyes and chuckling as he let out a relieved breath.\u00a0\u201cYou look pretty too.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter felt the blush on his cheeks, chuckling as he smoothed out his hair.\u00a0\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright everyone!\u201d Mr. Harrington rounded up the students once everyone had returned from the bathroom and their respective conversations.\u00a0\u201cThe evening is yours to explore as you\u2019d like. But remember, everyone needs to be at breakfast tomorrow at 8am!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWant to go for a walk?\u201d MJ asked, bumping Peters shoulder with hers as he watched her toss on her backpack.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019d be nice,\u201d he nodded, following her out into the night.\u00a0<br></p><p>You, however, decided to call it a night then and there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to go out with us?\u201d Harry asked, slinging an arm around Flash as the two of them stood next to a cab along with Elisa and a couple other classmates.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beat. I didn\u2019t nap earlier when you all did, so I\u2019m going to crash,\u201d you chuckled,\u00a0\u201cBut have a wild night, kiddos.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it!\u201d Flash called after you as you waved them off.\u00a0<br></p><p>You knew Venice. You\u2019d been to Venice before. And so walking back by yourself was actually quite nice, considering it was the first time you\u2019d been alone since you\u2019d left for this trip. You\u2019d gotten so used to being alone, and then you\u2019d been thrown back into society and suddenly it was a bit overwhelming.</p><p>So having this time to yourself \u2026 you were grateful.\u00a0</p><p>Your phone rang in your purse, causing you to groan and check it, only to see Nat was calling.</p><p>\u201cIs someone dying?\u201d you asked, hoping across a puddle as you continued to make your way back to your hotel.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes someone have to be dying for me to call?\u201d Nat asked, an obvious smirk in her voice.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUsually.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell no one is dying,\u201d Nat confirmed,\u00a0\u201cBut I do <i>miss</i> you and I\u2019m trying to be more open and honest with the people I love, so I figured I\u2019d give you a call.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re going soft on me,\u201d you mused.<br></p><p>\u201cOnly you, babe. So how\u2019s the trip?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Insufferable</i>,\u201d you grumbled,\u00a0\u201cThese kids are all stupid. They\u2019re trying their best, but the level of intellect is ghastly sometimes. I made a new friend named Betty. She\u2019s dating Ned so, obviously a keeper,\u201d you sighed, \u201cPeter\u2019s all over my ass -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure you <i>love</i> that,\u201d Nat chuckled, causing you to gasp.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Nat</i>!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust tell the boy you love him already,\u201d Nat groaned,\u00a0\u201cWe all have bets placed.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Well we do</i>!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You were quiet for a moment and Nat allowed you to think before you sighed.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s into someone else, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not know that. What\u2019s she like?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cPerfect. She\u2019s smart. She makes him laugh and she knows when he\u2019s in a bad mood. She helps him \u2026 she likes books.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of game where you describe yourself in third person? I\u2019ve been in a lot of therapy sessions but I\u2019ve never seen this exercise.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo! Nat -\u201d you groaned,\u00a0\u201cI told him to go after her, because she definitely likes him. They deserve each other. They\u2019re good for each other.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Nat groaned,\u00a0\u201cTeenagers are the fucking worst.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNat!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, listen, babe, I get that things have been really rough for you lately and I\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat anything or tell you that you aren\u2019t entitled to your own feelings, but you love that boy <i>so much</i> and I\u2019ve never seen anyone care for you the way that he does. He follows you around like a puppy whenever you\u2019re at the compound, and then he has no issue putting you in your place whenever you get a little too wild. He\u2019s so <i>good</i> for you, and you\u2019re <i>good</i> for him and I wish you would both just stop pining for one another and grow some balls and do something about it!\u201d<br></p><p>You didn\u2019t respond immediately, kicking at some loose stones in the street as you closed your eyes and attempted to not cry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe just have a lot of history and \u2026 it\u2019s just really complicated,\u201d you finally said, sniffling a bit.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t give it a chance,\u201d Nat said firmly,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you want to feel the love you know you deserve? Look, I\u2019ve got to go. Sam\u2019s being an asshole and I can hear him in the training room all the way from here in the kitchen. But just have fun, okay? And trust Peter. He\u2019s cared for you longer than you know. Don\u2019t be a wimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd have fun!\u201d Nat yelled before she hung up.\u00a0<br></p><p>God she was right, and that was the most frustrating part about it all. Nat always knew how to cut through the bullshit and be honest about what she had keenly observed. And maybe deep down you\u2019d always known Peter had feelings for you. It wasn\u2019t hard to deduct considering \u2026\u00a0</p><p>Whatever. Feelings were stupid. History made things complicated.</p><p>This was a conversation well overdue, and if it was going to happen then it would need to happen soon if anything was going to actually come from it. You weren\u2019t entirely sure where Peter had gotten up to after the cinema, but you had a feeling he would be back at the hotel rather soon, considering when he had a chance to have a full night\u2019s sleep he would take it without a second thought.\u00a0</p><p>MJ wasn\u2019t back yet, and so you figured Peter wasn\u2019t either. Opening your laptop, you skated around some emails and some of the upcoming assignments for the field trip. You were halfway through your analysis of the film you\u2019d watched in correlation with the novel, when you heard a bump outside your door and a giggle.</p><p>The giggle was so foreign to you that you knew immediately it had to be MJ. You\u2019d never heard that girl giggle before in your entire goddamn life, and it was almost painful to hear it now considering you had a feeling you knew who it was because of.\u00a0</p><p>Peeking your eye through the little peephole in the door, you were immediately met with Peter and MJ standing in front of Peter\u2019s door. They were both giggling, laughing about something Peter had whispered in MJ\u2019s ear as he was fishing for his key.\u00a0</p><p>MJ went to say something, her fingertips trailing along his elbow, and Peter suddenly turned to look straight at her, no longer laughing as she continued to babble, unaware of his stare.</p><p>You\u2019d seen that stare before. You knew what that meant. Peter had had that stare when he\u2019d hooked up with Melissa Greyson at the end of junior year right before the field trip, and he\u2019d often stared at you that way whenever he thought you wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d MJ laughed, a hushed word escaping her mouth before Peter had her in his arm - his one strong arm looped around her waist as she gasped and looked down at him, obviously shocked.\u00a0\u201cPeter, what -\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCan I -?\u201d Peter was obviously nervous, and your heart went out to the kid that he was finally doing something about this crush and yet was completely underwater and over his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d MJ said so quickly it even shocked you. Sure, you\u2019d known she liked the kid, but you\u2019d never pegged MJ as one to beg.\u00a0<br></p><p>His lips met hers and their eyes both closed and suddenly you wanted to turn away and vomit. Of course (because when in life was there not poorly timed conflict) Peter was just going to man up and kiss MJ <i>now</i>.</p><p><i>Of course.</i></p><p>Because you\u2019d told him too.\u00a0</p><p>Knowing that MJ would be coming back to your room probably quite soon after their hasty hallway make out session, you were quick to put all your things away and jump into bed, rushing to flick the light off so it looked like you\u2019d been asleep for longer than the five seconds your heart was hammering in your chest while attempting to lie still.\u00a0</p><p>And when the door finally did open and MJ came in, she of course figured you were asleep. Your back was to her, the lights were out, you had slowed down your rapid breathing enough that it was believable.\u00a0</p><p>She was quick in prepping for bed too, so you didn\u2019t have to worry about blowing your cover for too long.\u00a0</p><p>But what you should have been worried about, and what you hadn\u2019t even thought about in the heat of the moment, was the rapid beating and thundering of your heart, the adrenaline rushing through your body as you\u2019d tossed yourself around the room to prepare for MJ\u2019s entrance.\u00a0</p><p>Because no one else would have ever known you were faking your slumber, heart aching and body screaming to tear the room apart. But even from across the hall, standing in the doorway of his own door wondering if he should follow up or not, Peter\u2019s ears and senses were tuned in to the rapid and steady pounding of your heart against your ribcage.\u00a0</p><p>And though he\u2019d kissed MJ because he wanted to kiss MJ, it still made him feel a bit guilty that though he was happy about the kiss, he was a bit more interested in the fact that your heart pounding through his body had been the highlight of the night.\u00a0</p><p><i>Were you jealous?</i> It was question you were attempting to not think about, and Peter was starting to wonder.\u00a0</p><p>* * *</p><p><b><i>author\u2019s note: that was hella long and i know the timing of things and the countries aren\u2019t all accurate but this isn\u2019t supposed to be accurate to the movie because WHO KNOWS what\u2019s going to happen in the film !\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>regardless, hella angst, flash isn\u2019t that bad of a guy ? and lol @ peter just being like #theworst but also #thebest. i wrote this over the course of like a week and a half, lol, so if y\u2019all want more \u2026 you may have to wait a hot sec. unless there\u2019s just this massive influx of messages (which i know there won\u2019t be hence the setting myself up for success here), then the next update may come in a bit OR not at all lol.</i></b></p><p><b><i>but for those of you who were asking for more, here\u2019s a bit of what would have been to come. i put the intro at the top with the link for those who have not have seen that this is technically part two of a\u00a0\u201cseries\u201d so hope you enjoy it all ! and i\u2019d love to know what you may have to say about my writing/the stories/the character/what you would love to see/what you\u2019d love to know more of ! so i\u2019ll put the feedback link below, along with a link to my ko-fi because ya gurl is a poor af archaeology student trying to survive college and \u2026 four jobs ain\u2019t enough lol.</i></b></p><p><b><i>thanks for all the support ! so freaking kind, every single one of ya.</i></b></p><h2><i><b><a href=\"https://hey-marlie.tumblr.com/ask\">i\u2019m a thirsty narcissistic hoe for feedback plz send me a message</a></b></i></h2><h2><b>donate: <i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2FG2G3J972%23&amp;t=NmMyMWNmNTA3YzYxOTMyMjgxZTVlMWIwYWI0MDY0YmNkZDczZmFiMixTd2dtMnBRdA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Ax66cc1hbY_oRucCuLnQAFw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fhey-marlie.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178706066881%2Fn-o-v-e-l-t-y-ch-5&amp;m=1\">buy marlie b a coffee ?</a></i></b></h2></p>",

The correct foods, the time to take naps, and the amount of water to inhale like you were dying of dehydration.&nbsp;</p><p>So it didn&rsquo;t come as a shock to you when the plane landed and majority of your classmates were walking like slugs through the airport in Rome, while you and Peter had a bit of a pep to your step.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember when your dad took us to Rome and didn&rsquo;t tell us why,&rdquo; Peter spoke quietly, the only two students close to you both being Ned and MJ, who would know of your escapades already.<br /></p><p>You smiled,&nbsp;&ldquo;And when we got there he just threw our suits at us and left on the jet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our first mission,&rdquo; Peter chuckled,&nbsp;&ldquo;And your suit malfunctioned and you almost tore me in half.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He was laughing now, but at the time it was terrifying, and the Italian mafia ring that had - in the words of your dad been&nbsp;&ldquo;hardly any competition&rdquo; - almost gotten away with it when they&rsquo;d proved to be a far larger threat.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; you shook your head,&nbsp;&ldquo;That was our sophomore year.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;That was before Thor told me I actually needed to work out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could lift school buses but hardly had any muscles,&rdquo; you noted, pinching his forearm.&nbsp;&ldquo;And you pulled your groin muscle getting back on the jet. You were hobbling around for a week!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The two of you were laughing now quite obnoxiously, considering everyone else was quite exhausted and just wanted a quiet subway ride to the train station. But, just like old times, you and Peter were relentless.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Care to share with the class?&rdquo; Harry asked, sliding his sunglasses onto his face as you all followed Mr. Harrington towards the train station.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just reminiscing about the time Peter sprained his balls,&rdquo; you smirked, watching as Peter rolled his eyes and slung his arm around your shoulders lazily, leaving you to stagger slightly under his weight.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The scrawny boy had bulked up a bit since &hellip; since the initial event &hellip; and as he pulled his phone from his pocket and seemed to be distracted by the screen, you observed his profile closely.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop staring,&rdquo; Peter mumbled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You just look a bit different,&rdquo; you shrugged, leaning slightly into his arm as he stopped texted May of his whereabouts and slid his phone into his back pocket once more.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? Maybe I look the same, you just haven&rsquo;t seen me in a while.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The statement was innocent. It was a fact that you&rsquo;d been taking your summer vacation to yourself, and had opted to finish out the end of your junior year with online courses. So yes, you&rsquo;d physically been apart.</p><p>But emotionally, you and Peter hadn&rsquo;t connected in quite some time, and that was something new for the both of you, but only the fault of one of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah well &hellip;&rdquo; you slinked out from under Peter&rsquo;s arm, clearing your throat and adjusting your backpack,&nbsp;&ldquo;Some of us process things differently.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You tried to pretend you didn&rsquo;t see the slight pain in Peter&rsquo;s eyes when you pulled yourself away from him. Just the momentary and innocent touch of his arm around your shoulders made you feel more at ease - even in a train station in Rome - than you had in months.</p><p>But comfort led to complacency, and you felt the need to be more alert and aware.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright well, what fancy hotel am I going to be crashing in for the next week?&rdquo; Flash called towards Mr. Harrington, who seemed to be completely preoccupied by every map around him that he obviously couldn&rsquo;t read. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cute that you think you&rsquo;re going to be staying in some fancy digs, there, Eugene,&rdquo; you stated, watching as Ned snickered slightly and Betty gave you a beaming look. </p><p>You and Betty had never really been friends. She&rsquo;d asked you countless times if she could interview you for their morning news show and each time you&rsquo;d declined. You were pretty sure Peter had talked to her about it at one point after you&rsquo;d ranted to him about &ldquo;not having any privacy at this stupid school&rdquo; because she soon stopped and Peter was suddenly giving a report on the photojournalism work he was doing and how he&rsquo;d gotten a snap of Spider-Man.</p><p>What a narcissist. </p><p>&ldquo;I paid to be here,&rdquo; Flash whined, &ldquo;Just give me a bed.&rdquo;</p><p>The bed Flash did end up getting was in a run-down looking hotel where the lobby smelled like corn chips and the man sitting behind the counter looked like he belonged in some sort of episode of <i>The Series of Unfortunate Events.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;This &hellip; is &hellip;?&rdquo; Harry was at a loss for words as Peter pushed past him politely and set his suitcase down on a table. You watched him hesitantly as he fiddled with the handle and talked under his breath to MJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The suitcase was something you&rsquo;d never seen before. It was quite large, and never was what Peter would take when the two of you traveled for your dad&rsquo;s trips. He usually brought along a smaller carry on that was definitely Aunt May&rsquo;s, considering the faded pink flowers and the floral name tag.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;d never really said anything about it, and you know your dad had never mentioned it either. But you do know that your dad had bought Peter a whole set of luggage to use. So the fact that he wasn&rsquo;t using any of it &hellip; you weren&rsquo;t sure what exactly to say.&nbsp;</p><p>But then you noticed the little engraving as Peter continued to fiddle absentmindedly with the handle without even looking as he and MJ continued their conversation.&nbsp;</p><p><i>BFP.</i></p><p>Benjamin Franklin Parker.</p><p>You sucked in a breath at the realization that Peter was using his uncle Ben&rsquo;s old luggage. It made your heart warm and your body fill with little tingles as you noticed he never full let go of his luggage. God, what a goddamn cutie.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay class,&rdquo; Mr. Harrington attempted to cut off the multiple conversations going on all at once, and you simply sat back in your seat next to Harry, who was on his phone, and watched as everyone slowly started to pay attention to your teacher.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Room assignments,&rdquo; he held up multiple keys,&nbsp;&ldquo;Come and collect your keys and key card with the wifi password and find your roommate.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>It was like an odd mad dash for everyone to scramble to find the key with their name on it scribbled on the paper with the number. It didn&rsquo;t take long for you to find yours, or, in your case, for Peter to hand yours to you as he was shuffling through them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s you and me, girl,&rdquo; MJ said, twiddling her key between her fingers.&nbsp;&ldquo;Gotta say, I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You simply nodded, unsure what to say in a situation like this. So you decided on,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks. Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>The room was small, and Ned and Peter watched from their room on the other side of the hall as you and MJ attempted to get the closet doors open.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; you simply stated, too tired to attempt to try. MJ was already flopped over on the bed, and you both seemed to come to the realization that if you were ever going to open this rusty old closet door (that probably held a body) then you were going to need someone who could lift an entire bus with one hand.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peter opened it easily, a smirk on his face as MJ flipped him off and you simply shoved him out of the way to toss your things inside.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you guys want to go out and explore? We have the entire afternoon to go out on our own before dinner tonight.&rdquo; Peter looked amongst the four of you as he awaited a response, obviously not prepared for everyone to want to take a nap once immediately landing in a new and foreign country.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, we&rsquo;re jet lagged,&rdquo; Ned snorted,&nbsp;&ldquo;You honestly think I want to go out on a tour right now? We&rsquo;re going out tomorrow.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; MJ yawned,&nbsp;&ldquo;Gotta prep for tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>You watched as Peter started to deflate, fiddling with the ends of his hoodie strings as he sighed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; you shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not jet lagged.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Rich people,&rdquo; MJ mumbled, shooting you a playful smirk as you stuck your tongue out at her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you back gelato,&rdquo; you promised, before grabbing your backpack and following Peter out into the hallway.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You passed Harry in the hallway where he was looking at something on his phone with Flash while you and Peter attempted to make your way by.</p><p>&ldquo;Guys look at this.&rdquo; He nearly shoved his phone into your faces as Peter squinted - a lot of light too fast - and you grasped it from him to get a better look.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>It was a video going viral on YouTube of some huge sandstorm in what seemed to be Libya.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; you asked, squinting slightly as Peter looked over your shoulder as you got a better look at the shaky footage.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a typical sandstorm. It was what seemed to be a giant being? If you could call it that. You felt Peter&rsquo;s breath on your throat, causing you to grip the phone a bit tighter considering the proximity of which it was bringing Peter closer to you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Buildings were being swept up, cars being flattened, and you didn&rsquo;t even want to think of what had happened to the people had there been any large masses anywhere close.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Some crazy anomaly in Libya,&rdquo; Harry said excited,&nbsp;&ldquo;It straight up looks like a man.&rdquo;</p><p>You took the liberty of sending the link to the video to your phone, feeling the vibration in your pocket before handing it back to Harry. Flash was silent, as if gauging your reaction to what you&rsquo;d just seen. It was this freaky next-level bullshit that you knew used to be an Avengers project, but with the way things were now &hellip; no Tony. No Cap. Well &hellip; you weren&rsquo;t sure what the protocol was.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Peter offered, casually and calmly taking your hand in his as the two of you made your way towards the lobby.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>It was a nice sunny day, which you hadn&rsquo;t had in a while, and so you placed your sunglasses on your head in delight as the two of you decided to make your way towards the nearest cafe.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I sent the video to myself,&rdquo; you told Peter as the two of you sat down and ordered some pizza. Well, you both ordered your own pizzas but you knew Peter would be eating close to both of them, saving you probably two or three slices.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You pulled out your phone and watched as the hologram of the video produced itself between the two of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Y/N, we don&rsquo;t need to watch this,&rdquo; Peter sighed, nearly inhaling another piece of pizza into his mouth and holding his water glass as if his life depended on it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I caught this though,&rdquo; you pointed out, zooming in on the video - something you couldn&rsquo;t have done on Harry&rsquo;s iPhone, and freezing the video on two figures that had been standing off to the side of the shot. Too small to be seen on any regular viewing - but with some enhancing and fancy Stark tech well &hellip;<br /></p><p>It was obvious to you that Maria Hill and Nick Fury were on the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s S.H.I.E.L.D.,&rdquo; you motioned to Fury as Peter squinted and turned the screen to get a better view himself.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yep. Sure is,&rdquo; he mumbled, going back to his next slice.&nbsp;&ldquo;Good for them.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to call Happy and ask about this?&rdquo; you raised an eyebrow.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not going to ask me to call either?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, we&rsquo;re on vacation,&rdquo; Peter sighed,&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in Venice. We&rsquo;re eating pizza. We haven&rsquo;t hung out in four months. Can&rsquo;t you just take this time and appreciate it for what it is without having to look outside the situation to find something else?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You stared at Peter, simply blinking and wondering what kind of comeback you were going to have.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring the suit,&rdquo; Peter continued, then winced,&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t pack the suit with any thought of being Spider-Man here. May was the one that tucked it in there last minute. Nearly blew my cover through customs.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You chuckled at this, knowing the Peter Parker Panic Face all too well.&nbsp;</p><p>There was something surreal about being here with Peter and just relaxing. You couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time you&rsquo;d felt this at ease. He was looking over across San Marco square and just sipping his water like the pretty boy he was, and you were sitting here not focusing on him and God, that was a crime.</p><p>You turned your phone off and cleared your throat,&nbsp;&ldquo;So &hellip; you and MJ.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter choked on his water, doubling over slightly as he wiped his mouth on his flannel and looked over at you questionably.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You and Michelle Jones,&rdquo; you smirked,&nbsp;&ldquo;I can see it. I&rsquo;ll have to gossip with Ned later. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s head of the fan club.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No - Y/N, no. That&rsquo;s not -&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; you shrugged, cutting him off because really, you did not want to hear the explanation.&nbsp;&ldquo;You two have always been close. You both went through a lot together, so I can understand the connection.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter scoffed and leaned back in his chair,&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through a lot together and we aren&rsquo;t going to date.&rdquo;</p><p>You broke your straw just like that, one flick of your fingers and it snapped as Peter stared at you with wide eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p><i>No I&rsquo;m not fucking okay. Love me!</i> you screamed, internally, where your broken and selfish heart was having a bitch-fit to break free from the cage you&rsquo;d put around it. Your heart just couldn&rsquo;t stay in its fucking lane.</p><p>You composed yourself and shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you suddenly lying to me? Just be honest. Do you have feelings for MJ?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hesitated and it was then that you knew you were toast. You were the butt end of a loaf of bread that got stuck in the toaster after being put off for days because no one really wanted you, but you were the only option left.&nbsp;</p><p>But Peter wasn&rsquo;t yours. Peter may have been yours at one point when the two of you were thick as thieves, running around the compound and attempting to make your dad laugh whenever you tried out new gadgets and blasted the Inspector Gadget theme song hopped up on energy drinks.&nbsp;</p><p>He was yours when you&rsquo;d lay awake at night talking about things that had always bothered the two of you about growing up so young in an atmosphere the Avengers had pulled you into.</p><p>He&rsquo;d been yours every time he smiled in your direction at school or slid into the bench at lunch next to you, or cheered whenever Happy would allow either of you to drive the fancy car that would pick you up from school.&nbsp;</p><p>And he&rsquo;d been yours for a night once. But the thought had your whole body seemingly bursting into flames and aching as if being probed intensely under the brightest and harshest of lights.&nbsp;</p><p>But now, sitting across from him in Venice where your toes were touching and Peter was looking like sunshine behind his sunglasses, and you were sitting in your favorite cardigan with one and a half pizzas eaten between you &hellip; you knew Peter wasn&rsquo;t yours anymore.</p><p>Four months was a long time. One sunny day in Venice couldn&rsquo;t change anything.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone through a lot,&rdquo; Peter sighed, pulling you back into the conversation.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;ve all been through a lot. But uh &hellip;&rdquo; Peter sighed and ruffled his hair,&nbsp;&ldquo;She took it like a champ. The therapy, the new job &hellip; she had Mr. Delmar smiling every day when she&rsquo;d arrive for work, you know? And she&rsquo;s always been proud and confident, but she&rsquo;s been more caring and aware of the student body since everything has happened and honestly? I&rsquo;ve been impressed.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter shrugged, as if his declaration would mean anything less.&nbsp;</p><p>A breeze washed over the two of you and you caught a whiff of his scent - the mix of cologne and boyish charm you&rsquo;ve always associated with Peter since you&rsquo;d met him.</p><p>You wondered sometimes what your smell was like to him. Well, you at least tried not to think about that anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you go for it?&rdquo; you encouraged.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You weren&rsquo;t a <i>bitch</i>. Well, okay yeah you <i>definitely</i> were a bitch. But you&rsquo;d never been a bitch by default. That was a hard exterior you&rsquo;d built up over the years prior to meeting Peter, and since he&rsquo;d come into your life like the who goddamn sun that he was - not even just a ray of sunshine - he had been slowly chipping away at that persona to find the happy sunshine girl underneath that you&rsquo;d always been.&nbsp;</p><p>But you were never and will never be a bitch to your friends - especially Peter. And if helping Peter find someone that would take care of him and be there for him and take the time to understand him &hellip; then fuck it, you were Team MJ more than even Ned Leeds probably was.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my friend, Y/N, I can&rsquo;t just &hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She likes you,&rdquo; you scoffed, rolling your eyes and shoving your sunglasses down your face so you could look Peter more aggressively in the eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve been gone for a while, but that girl has liked you for ages, and she seems to be smitten with you now more than ever.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s blushing, and you would continue to push him until he&rsquo;d just admit his feelings, if you didn&rsquo;t see some of your school group over his shoulder making their way towards you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well well well,&rdquo; you chuckled, sitting up straighter and shoving your glasses back on your face as the MJ in question plopped down next to Peter and grabbed his water glass from him, chugging it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You smirked as Peter looked at her obviously in shock, and she seemed to not be in the mood to look his way.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tired,&rdquo; she grumbled, reaching over for a slice of pizza still left.</p><p>&ldquo;Those beds are not &hellip; comfortable,&rdquo; Ned grumbled,&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how Betty is still sleeping.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You just miss your super nice therapeutic mattress,&rdquo; you joked,&nbsp;&ldquo;You still have that right? Storm Trooper sheets and all?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ned laughed and swatted at your arm lazily, sitting back in his chair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s it like being back in the land of the living?&rdquo; Harry asked you, sitting down on your other side and wrapping his arm around the back of your seat.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Harry was a nice kid. Harry could be fun. Harry would make for a great distraction for the whole Peter and MJ thing that you were sure was happening. So you leaned into his touch.</p><p>Sighing, you shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;Much more lively than throwing darts and shooting guns at targets all day with Nat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love that you casually name drop the Black Widow,&rdquo; Harry snorted and shook his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy, girl.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well she has been hanging out with Black Widow,&rdquo; MJ pointed out, smirking towards you with a flicker of admiration.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Girls were so fucking petty. You knew you got lucky when you realized the only person who you may ever have to compete for attention from Peter was MJ. She was so chill and like a goddamn queen with her intellect, looks, and wit. Hell, you always told yourself that if Peter and MJ did end up together, at least you&rsquo;d know you&rsquo;d have a super cool friend for life along with Peter.</p><p>So why it was irking you so much that Peter was staring at MJ&rsquo;s profile - moments after you&rsquo;d suggested he just go for it&nbsp; - well &hellip; girls are petty.&nbsp;</p><p>When dinner came, you were all herded towards an older restaurant that you were pretty sure you were only going to because Mr. Harrington had read five thousand reviews on Yelp. He kept using words you were sure he wasn&rsquo;t familiar with when it came to the culinary craft, and it seemed he was the only one excited.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to eat my weight in pasta,&rdquo; Flash smoothed out his blazer as you patted his shoulder. You weren&rsquo;t sure when it started, considering you&rsquo;d only really been back with these kids for about a day and a half, but Flash was suddenly hovering around you in an oddly protective manner.<br /></p><p>Considering the kind words he&rsquo;d shared with you at the airport, and then the fact that he&rsquo;d been quiet and respectful whenever you&rsquo;d talked since, made you wonder if maybe Flash really was trying to be a better person instead of the attention-seeking prideful bully you&rsquo;d known him to be in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>But then he shoved Peter as you were all walking into the restaurant and you couldn&rsquo;t help but want to shove him into the Venice canals and run him over with a gondola.&nbsp;</p><p>The meal was just fine, considering everyone was starving and the jet lag was starting to kick in so everyone was rowdy. You&rsquo;d never been abroad with a group of students before, only ever with your dad, and the closest you&rsquo;d ever come to a European vacation was when you and Peter finished your mission in Rome by highjacking the jet that was sent for you and spending a long weekend in Monte Carlo.&nbsp;</p><p>You shuddered just thinking about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone was lagging by the time Mr. Harrington started to drag you all to the cinema to watch some Italian film based off a book you were all supposed to read. The only one to actually read it was MJ, and even she didn&rsquo;t want to see the film, but &hellip; that&rsquo;s life.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Peter cleared his throat and placed his hands together, pointing at you with both his hands. It made you smile, because it was something your dad used to do and a bit of a joke that you and Peter had picked up to mess with him. And now seeing Peter do it gave you this odd feeling of home, mixed with a bit of guilt and regret &hellip; but mostly home.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay indeed,&rdquo; you nodded, sauntering along with MJ, Ned, and Betty in the back of the group as everyone followed a very confused teacher who was bad at maps.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s place bets. Who are we thinking tonight?&rdquo; MJ asked, skipping from one stone to the next with calculated precision and balance.&nbsp;&ldquo;Obviously I want to put ten on Bets and Nedd-o.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ned rolled his eyes,&nbsp;&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re a couple! You can&rsquo;t place bets on us!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; Betty looked around, obviously confused considering the conversation was completely and ridiculously immature, but tradition.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Whenever we watch films in school the four of us would usually place bets on who would get with who -&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Whom,&rdquo; you corrected Peter. He rolled his eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh who would get with whom,&rdquo; he shot you a look,&nbsp;&ldquo;while the lights were out. And considering Mr. Harrington has us watch a lot of films, the four of us have made some good money over the years.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You and Stevie Preston got me fifty bucks,&rdquo; you told Betty.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I still have no idea how you got that one,&rdquo; MJ groaned,&nbsp;&ldquo;Why did you cuddle with Stevie anyway? His posture is atrocious and he&rsquo;s always talking about his bug collection.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Betty looked confused,&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, that day specifically he was wearing this jacket that smelled really nice like lavender, and that&rsquo;s my favorite smell and he told me he liked my new green brooch so &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. I was feeling sentimental,&rdquo; Betty shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Obviously a one time thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; Peter grumbled,&nbsp;&ldquo;You and Stevie Preston cost me fifty bucks.&rdquo;</p><p>You patted Peter&rsquo;s cheek happily before laughing.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was simple, really,&rdquo; you shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;I manufactured the whole thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bullshit,&rdquo; MJ shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;No really,&rdquo; you smiled,&nbsp;&ldquo;I knew Betty liked the smell of lavender considering the hand lotion you always use after gym class before we went to lunch. And Stevie is always one for getting cold - he never wears a jacket - and that morning when I noticed he was chilly, I handed over one of Peter&rsquo;s old hoodies he&rsquo;d left at my place ages ago that I&rsquo;d put lavender perfume on. Then, I noticed the pride you had in your new brooch, Bets, so I simply commented on it in the presence of Stevie, who obviously had a crush on you, and mentioned how people don&rsquo;t notice nice things like that anymore and girls like when guys notice those things. So &hellip; Stevie comments on your brooch and smells like lavender and BOOM I manufactured love.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>No one said anything as you continued to walk, but all of them clearly looked dumbstruck. There was a mix of fear and awe in Peter&rsquo;s eyes, which turned into pride as he broke out into a smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;And then you out of the blue bet me fifty knowing that it would happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I also knew you had fifty because my dad paid you the day before and I knew I wanted to go to that thai place for dinner and I could get you to go if I had the money to do so. Which, prior to our bet, I did not.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You two are seriously twisted,&rdquo; Ned shook his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you feed off one another. I bet your murders take half the time to plan when you decide to go in on it together.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes as Peter laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll bet Jon and Samantha will at least make out once,&rdquo; MJ cleared her throat,&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been secretly hooking up all summer.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And how do you know that?&rdquo; Peter asked, twisting his body slightly to look back at where MJ was trailing behind him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because they never stand farther than arm&rsquo;s length apart. That means at least something,&rdquo; MJ rolled her eyes.<br /></p><p>You watched as Peter&rsquo;s eyes traveled from his arm to yours, noticing the short distance between the two of you before he attempted to hesitantly shift away a bit farther.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well how much and against whom are you betting then?&rdquo; you asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say a solid fifteen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Weak.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Logical,&rdquo; MJ countered.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll bet Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Also weak,&rdquo; you snickered.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off,&rdquo; Peter laughed, pushing you slightly as you bat childishly at his hand.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;God stop flirting and just make out in a closet somewhere already,&rdquo; Ned joked. Three separate interactions took place where you shot Ned a look, Peter immediately looked away from you while blushing, and MJ went a bit rigid, looking down at her feet.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a bet,&rdquo; you said, turning and walking backwards so you could get a good look at everyone&rsquo;s faces.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no longer allowed,&rdquo; MJ stuck her tongue out at you, the prior Ned comment having passed within the length of five paces.&nbsp;&ldquo;You manufacture love. That&rsquo;s cheating.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t have anything on me now to do so, now do I?&rdquo; you asked, opening your arms as if to prove a point.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She has a point,&rdquo; Peter cocked his head slightly, intrigued.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s had a lot of points, but she&rsquo;s still a cheater,&rdquo; MJ shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m vetoing your bet.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You huffed,&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll place one,&rdquo; Betty spoke up, a bit timid.&nbsp;</p><p>Betty was a smart girl, there was no denying that. Her drive and spunk gave her an upper hand on majority of the school. She was going to be an ace reporter one day, that was for sure, but in the midst of three geniuses - you, Peter and MJ - well, anyone would be a bit timid when trying to impress your boyfriend&rsquo;s best friends.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; you cheered,&nbsp;&ldquo;Now this is getting interesting! Place your bets, Bets.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>A bit of a pink blush tinted Betty&rsquo;s cheeks as she spoke,&nbsp;&ldquo;I bet twenty euros that Flash will try to make out with Y/N during the film.&rdquo;</p><p>Oxygen seemed to funnel from the group as everyone remained silent long enough for their shock to cling to every fiber of their bones. No one had bet on you before, minus the first three times that Ned had bet MJ that you and Peter would lean in and cuddle at some point.&nbsp;</p><p>But that was a given, and Ned and MJ had quickly grown tired of losing their money to one another.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Flash?&rdquo; you stumbled slightly from walking backwards and Peter was quick to catch you, straightening you out as you cleared your throat.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some big talk there Bets.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Betty shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone can see he&rsquo;s been trying to make a move since you got back. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he and Harry are secretly fighting over you. Flash has always had something for you, we all know it, and if Harry give you one more look while you&rsquo;re not looking at him then he might die right then and there.&rdquo;</p><p>You were blushing now, feeling a deep warmth splinter through your entire body.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; was all you said before turning back around and swiftly doing your best to keep up with the group.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did I do something wrong?&rdquo; Betty asked, watching your retreating figure as Peter nibbled on his bottom lip. Betty wasn&rsquo;t the only one that had noticed Flash&rsquo;s interest in you, or the way Harry&rsquo;s stare had lingered everywhere you go since you&rsquo;d returned to the living. It had made his skin crawl with an uncomfortable feeling settling in the tips of his fingers that itched to grasp you as tight as he could and hide you away from prying eyes.<br /></p><p>But that wasn&rsquo;t his job.</p><p>&ldquo;No you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; MJ said, coming up a bit closer so her shoulder brushed against Peter&rsquo;s as they walked,&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a bit sensitive to &hellip; relationships, I think. It&rsquo;s never really been her thing.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Relationships?&rdquo; Betty furrowed her eyebrows, obviously confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Emotional commitment,&rdquo; MJ corrected.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I wonder why,&rdquo; Peter mumbled, more to himself, but MJ looked to him and he could tell she was struggling to figure out a way to explain you to others that wouldn&rsquo;t sound like she was judging. MJ meant well, and Peter appreciated that.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll take that bet, baby,&rdquo; Ned said, grasping Betty&rsquo;s hand and squeezing it tight. Betty smiled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>As everyone filed into the cinema, you plopped down in the middle, ready for Peter to find a seat next to you and allow you to toss your legs across his lap. But instead, Flash - speak of the devil - sat down next to you and adjusted himself so he was more lounging than sitting.</p><p>&ldquo;You read this?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; you rolled your eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah you did.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Flash looked at you as you let out a long huff through your nose, turning and facing him, locking eyes in a challenging way.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Fine</i>. Maybe I did.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Flash smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;See, you can pretend you don&rsquo;t care about all this literature and history and art. You&rsquo;re a science kid through and through - I get that. But you also aced all our art history tests last spring term, and you even won our history essay contest. This shit excites you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>This shit</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; you snorted,&nbsp;&ldquo;Nice.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Betty and Ned settled down in front of you, Betty looking over her shoulder to give you a quick, bold suggestive look. You smirked. Leaning forward, you placed your head between Ned and Betty, clearing your throat for attention.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I will bet you both fifty bucks that by the end of tonight, Peter and MJ will make out.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ned nearly spit out all his water as Betty gasped so loudly that everyone turned to see if she was alright. You locked eyes with Peter, from where he and MJ were sitting a bit off to the side, two rows in front of Ned and Betty. You winked at him and made a little kissy face before turning your attention back to Betty and Ned.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you accept my bet?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hell yeah</i> I accept your bet,&rdquo; Ned laughed, turning to face you,&nbsp;&ldquo;I would love fifty bucks.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re about to lose it, so cherish it now,&rdquo; you winked before sitting back in your seat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Flash asked, tossing some popcorn in his mouth. You leaned over and helped yourself, chewing slowly as you thought.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I just bet Betty and Ned each fifty bucks that Peter and MJ would be making out by the end of tonight.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Flash stared at you, a bit dumbfounded, as he finally broke out into a low chuckle.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah right. You&rsquo;d sell all your secrets to the media before allowing MJ to kiss your man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What</i>?!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Turning to look at Flash, you could tell in his smug expression that the rise he&rsquo;d gotten out of you was exactly what he was hoping for.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, <i>come on</i> Y/N,&rdquo; Flash chuckled and turned to face you a bit more as the lights dimmed for the film.&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t honestly expect me to have been in the same classroom as you and Dr. Prodigy over there for the past four years and not see clear as day that you are <i>obviously</i> in love with him.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You blinked, giving yourself some time to process this, as you reached out and grabbed some more popcorn.&nbsp;&ldquo;Stupid,&rdquo; was the only remark you could think to utter.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I was there when you found out that Peter had &hellip;&rdquo; Flash trailed off and cleared his throat,&nbsp;&ldquo;You <i>punched</i> a security guard right in the <i>face</i>.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We lost a lot of people. I thought my dad had also died then,&rdquo; you recalled.</p><p>Flash rolled his eyes and adjusted the popcorn on his lap so it was more centered towards you, the one who was obviously going to be eating more of it.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can say whatever you want, Y/N, but I&rsquo;m not stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are stupid.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not <i>that</i> stupid,&rdquo; Flash quipped back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to love him, you know. Like, he&rsquo;s a nerd and a <i>total loser</i> but I bet you guys have a lot of fun with the internship. Having access to that kind of tech &hellip; I mean, hell yeah I can see where the whole friends to lovers situation blossomed in your little stone cold heart.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ridiculous.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in denial,&rdquo; Flash shrugged.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want Peter to be happy,&rdquo; you hissed, attempting to not take away from the film.&nbsp;&ldquo;And MJ makes him happy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Flash shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling the truth.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re attempting to speak it into existence, <i>sure</i>.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Flash was sitting there smug, watching the film and sighing,&nbsp;&ldquo;These subtitles are wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t speak Italian.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes actually, I <i>do</i> speak Italian.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You speak Italian?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh my God</i> are you deaf?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You and Flash looked at one another for a moment as he smirked, his eyes twinkling as he was obviously enjoying this conversation. You couldn&rsquo;t believe that resident idiot Flash Thompson was actually &hellip; observant &hellip; and smart?</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; you laughed lightly, shaking your head and sinking down in your seat to be on Flash&rsquo;s level.</p><p>&ldquo;Number one bully, you know that,&rdquo; Flash shrugged.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God. Are you one of those angsty art kids that is super good at science and maths but secretly wants to be the next Vincent van Gogh?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Flash rolled his eyes,&nbsp;&ldquo;I only know you aced all your art history exams because you&rsquo;re the only one that got higher marks than me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Holy shit</i>.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Flash nodded.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You actually watched the rest of the film. And considering you had read the book, listening to the Italian and enjoying the subtitles and plot twists was more thrilling considering you had a familiarity for the story. And, somehow without your knowledge, you&rsquo;d slowly found yourself leaning against Flash as the two of you shared the rest of his popcorn.&nbsp;</p><p>His arm was warm, and the kind of arm that was comfortable to lean your head on instead of the back of the cinema seats.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When&rsquo;d you learn Italian?&rdquo; you asked at some point in the film.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My mom&rsquo;s Italian.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>No shit</i>.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know. Crazy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The fact that Flash seemed to just kind of be unimpressed with his own existence was interesting to you, and a bit intriguing, and you really figured that maybe this whole bullying thing was coming from his own disinterest in his own life - a cry for help? If you will?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fascinating.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; Flash shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no more popcorn.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get more. I know what happens; I&rsquo;ve read the book,&rdquo; you joked, grabbing the bucket and making your way towards the lobby.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So &hellip; you feel bad for Betty or something? Trying to make her some extra cash?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You turned to see Peter standing there, close-lipped awkward smile on his face and two empty drink cups in his hands.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting MJ a refill? Nice. Very date material,&rdquo; you winked, wiggling your shoulders in a bit of a shimmy before turning back to the concessions and handing them the bucket.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you bet Ned and Betty that MJ and I would make out?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Wow, fuck super hearing. Of course.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me,&rdquo; you mumbled, closing your eyes and turning back around to see Peter waiting there intently.<br /></p><p>He gave you another close-lipped smile, letting out a long breath of air through his nose,&nbsp;&ldquo;Well now I&rsquo;m just getting mixed signals,&rdquo; he joked,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling <i>others</i> I&rsquo;m going to make out with MJ and now you&rsquo;re telling <i>me</i> to fuck you? Mixed signals, babe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Watch your mouth there, Petey,&rdquo; you wiggled your finger,&nbsp;&ldquo;They can hear you now.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You pointed up to the heavens, knowing that the joke was may be a bit too soon, but also knowing that Peter had always known you as the joking type.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Hide behind your jokes</i>, <i>Y/N</i>, you thought to yourself, <i>and maybe this cute boy won&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re in love with him.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Peter sighed now, admitting his lack of understanding of the situation.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Flash</i>? Really, Y/N?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you know he speaks Italian?&rdquo; you asked him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t. Yeah he&rsquo;s a fucking idiot and kind of a bully, but he&rsquo;s <i>listening</i> to me, Peter, and he&rsquo;s having a <i>real</i> conversation with me. Not a Stark conversation where he&rsquo;s too reserved to ask certain things, but he&rsquo;s seeing me as just another classmate.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You shrugged as Peter handed the concessions guy the drinks and rolled his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;If he was <i>really</i> treating you like his other classmates then he <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> be hitting on you. He&rsquo;d be making fun of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re being honest here, I think he has more of a crush on you than anyone else,&rdquo; you shrugged, leaning against the counter and popping some popcorn in your mouth.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are his main target of interest when it comes to bullying.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He has a thing for Spider-Man,&rdquo; Peter chuckled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We did find his Twitter account that one time, this is true,&rdquo; you nodded thoughtfully.&nbsp;&ldquo;So,<i> if anything</i>, he&rsquo;s using me as a way to get to Spider-Man. You should be flattered.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter took the drinks back and looked at you straight on.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Europe. I&rsquo;m here having fun with my friends. Isn&rsquo;t that what you wanted?&rdquo; you asked,&nbsp;&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re here having fun with your friends, and I&rsquo;m back, so I can help you with your girl issues. I really think MJ likes you. Why won&rsquo;t you just make a move?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t say anything as he just stared at you, his face hard and his senses a bit on the fritz as he felt the need to slam the drinks against the wall.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you really going to do something stupid?&rdquo; he asked you, barely a whisper as you stopped from where the two of you had started to make your way back to the cinema.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not stupid if I decide to do it. I&rsquo;m a Stark. We only make good decisions,&rdquo; you winked.<br /></p><p><i>Wrong</i>. History had <i>definitely</i> proven that wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s tone was a bit colder than you were used to. It stopped you in your tracks as you turned to see he was holding the cups rather tightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you going out and making any rash decisions because you&rsquo;re hurting,&rdquo; Peter said sternly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Last time -&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Last time you weren&rsquo;t here</i>,&rdquo; you hissed, cutting him off and stepping up as close to him as you could get. Your chests were practically touching as you stared him down, challenging him to turn away.<br /></p><p>You&rsquo;d never been as extravagant with you drugs and alcohol and partying as your dad had been. It was probably because you had known the man he was once that was all over, and you had aspired to be like that man. But when Peter was gone &hellip; when he&rsquo;d &hellip; <i>left</i> &hellip; God, that had hurt you more than anything else in this world and it had prompted you to be a bit more reckless in all aspects of your life - school, crime fighting, drugs and recreation. Rhodey had gone insane looking after you.&nbsp;</p><p>But in your defense, you&rsquo;d lost Peter twice.&nbsp;</p><p><i>You first lost Peter when he left in the space ship, leaving you behind without so much as a strong hold on your hand as his lips pressed to the back of your hand, his eyebrows furrowed together tightly as he clung to you, knowing that this could be the last time he&rsquo;d see you.</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;d been really sick when he left, or else you would have left with him. You&rsquo;d gone on a mission not two weeks before that and contracted some sort of chemical reaction to the lab you&rsquo;d crashed. It had left you frail and tired, but with your dad on the case, he&rsquo;d found a solution rather quickly. It was only a matter of time to heal.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Peter had swung through the window of the hospital wing, sticking to it when he landed and then tipping it open so he could topple in.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hi hey listen quickly,&rdquo; he said, stumbling over to you as he worked to get his suit on. He&rsquo;d been on a field trip - a field trip you really hadn&rsquo;t been too sad to miss, if you were being honest - and you knew that he&rsquo;d come back here probably to get some more web fluid before going back out.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; you asked, attempting to sit up but Peter was quick to push you back down and make sure you were tucked in tightly.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No no stop. Y/N, listen.&rdquo; His words were rushed, and you could see some panic in his eyes as he cleared his throat and grasped your hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;I gotta go.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What? Where? Where&rsquo;s my dad?&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s - it&rsquo;s a thing. I don&rsquo;t know but some - in the sky? I just needed -&rdquo; he held up the web fluid and continued to attempt to catch his breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;I gotta go,&rdquo; he whispered, as if that explained everything.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;In the sky? What thing?&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Space ship,&rdquo; Peter whispered, grasping your hand even tighter in both of his. He looked down at it, smoothing his thumb over the back of your hand that wasn&rsquo;t connected to an IV and cleared his throat, letting out a long breath.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I gotta go,&rdquo; he mumbled again, bending down and kissing your hand strongly. You could feel his breath on your wrist from his nose, the shakiness of his hands starting to make you a bit nervous.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, stepping back as if making himself leave you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He nodded again before groaning and stepping back over to you and pressing his lips now to your forehead, running one hand through your hair as he did so.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well &hellip; be safe?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>You didn&rsquo;t know the weight of the situation. You&rsquo;d seen Peter shaken like this before, but things had always turned out okay. When you&rsquo;d been exposed to the chemical formula, your dad had nearly had to punch Peter unconscious to keep him from tearing off the scientists&rsquo; head. Peter&rsquo;s anger issues started around the time he met you, but you&rsquo;d always been able to keep him under check.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah yeah,&rdquo; Peter nodded, gulping slightly and holding his mask. It was then you could see it in his eyes that he was scared - far more scared than he had ever been - and you started to sit up.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with you,&rdquo; you said sternly, starting to reach for the IV in your hand and in your arm but you felt the wet and cold snap of Peter&rsquo;s webbing hitting your hand, solidifying you to the bed.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;PETE -&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. God I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; Peter almost looked terrified of himself and what he&rsquo;d done as you struggled against the webbing,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Y/N. I gotta go.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>And then he was gone.&nbsp;</i></p><p>That was the first time you lost Peter Parker - when he left you there in the hospital wing and didn&rsquo;t come back. And when people started disintegrating around you, there was a part of you that always <i>knew</i> Peter was gone. Peter was with your dad and he was in space and he was gone - they were both gone.&nbsp;</p><p>But then you got the distress call from your dad and your pain subsided immediately. Your dad and Peter were <i>alive</i>, and Cap went with you to the ship to greet them.&nbsp;</p><p>To greet, you quickly learned, a party of one.</p><p>And though every fiber in your bones was crying out that your dad was back and he was safe, there was only one look that your dad had to give you and a,&nbsp;&ldquo;He wanted me to say -&rdquo; before you felt as though you were being torn apart. Cap was beside himself with remorse at your response and had to carry you back to the jet, sedating you for the flight back so you would just <i>stop screaming</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, staring at Peter now in a cinema in Venice after four long months of longing to be near him and not know how &hellip; there was no way Peter would ever know that he was your greatest weakness.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I would never do anything stupid,&rdquo; you told him,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> lashing out. I&rsquo;m exploring my options with a boy who I think likes me and sees me and could be a great distraction on this trip.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter cleared his throat, taking a step back and looking past you, away from your gaze.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; was all he said before he walked back inside in front of you, making his way over to where MJ was watching the film intently.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That took <i>ages</i>,&rdquo; Flash groaned, grabbing the popcorn from you as you chuckled, flicking at his popped collar.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the line,&rdquo; you lied easily, looking over to see Peter handing MJ her drink before hesitantly slipping an arm around the back of her chair, settling in as she molded herself against him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; Flash whistled under his breath,&nbsp;&ldquo;You might win your bet.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Easy money,&rdquo; you grumbled, turning back to the popcorn and remaining silent the rest of the film.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>When the film was over and you were all filing out, Peter and MJ were the last ones out considering they were sitting the closest to the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; MJ asked, a bit weary to ask.<br /></p><p>Peter hummed and rubbed his eyes, adjusting the jacket he was wearing and shaking his head as if to shake out the conversation he&rsquo;d had with you. You were standing over by Flash and Harry and another girl from your class that Peter had always thought was nice. The two of you, he remembered, had worked on an English assignment together once and you&rsquo;d said she was quite bright.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;d chosen a simple black dress that tied in the back with small white polka dots for the cinema, with your wedges that had the red straps that wrapped up around your ankle. You looked beautiful with your matching red lipstick and hair pulled back into a low ponytail - strategic stray hairs framing your face.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter huffed, turning back to MJ and seeing she was watching him intently.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You look pretty,&rdquo; he commented, meaning every word.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Therefore I have value?&rdquo; MJ smirked, seemingly unimpressed with the statement.<br /></p><p>And Peter panicked.&nbsp;</p><p>He had to give MJ credit where credit was due. <i>MJ</i> had been the one to be there for him when they&rsquo;d all returned. <i>She</i> was the one who had come over to his house when he had nightmares, or allow him to rant for hours after a particularly bad patrol. <i>She</i> was the one who had been there for him all these months as <i>you&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;been the one to lock yourself away.&nbsp;</p><p>And in that time, yeah, Peter had to be honest, he&rsquo;d started to develop feelings for MJ. It would be nice, he would admit, to see where they would go because he knew MJ&rsquo;s heart beat quickened whenever he was around her, and that she was particularly more twitchy whenever he was close.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t rocket science. And even rocket science was easy for Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding,&rdquo; MJ quickly said, noticing Peter&rsquo;s large eyes and chuckling as he let out a relieved breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;You look pretty too.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter felt the blush on his cheeks, chuckling as he smoothed out his hair.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright everyone!&rdquo; Mr. Harrington rounded up the students once everyone had returned from the bathroom and their respective conversations.&nbsp;&ldquo;The evening is yours to explore as you&rsquo;d like. But remember, everyone needs to be at breakfast tomorrow at 8am!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Want to go for a walk?&rdquo; MJ asked, bumping Peters shoulder with hers as he watched her toss on her backpack.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;d be nice,&rdquo; he nodded, following her out into the night.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You, however, decided to call it a night then and there.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want to go out with us?&rdquo; Harry asked, slinging an arm around Flash as the two of them stood next to a cab along with Elisa and a couple other classmates.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beat. I didn&rsquo;t nap earlier when you all did, so I&rsquo;m going to crash,&rdquo; you chuckled,&nbsp;&ldquo;But have a wild night, kiddos.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it!&rdquo; Flash called after you as you waved them off.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You knew Venice. You&rsquo;d been to Venice before. And so walking back by yourself was actually quite nice, considering it was the first time you&rsquo;d been alone since you&rsquo;d left for this trip. You&rsquo;d gotten so used to being alone, and then you&rsquo;d been thrown back into society and suddenly it was a bit overwhelming.</p><p>So having this time to yourself &hellip; you were grateful.&nbsp;</p><p>Your phone rang in your purse, causing you to groan and check it, only to see Nat was calling.</p><p>&ldquo;Is someone dying?&rdquo; you asked, hoping across a puddle as you continued to make your way back to your hotel.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Does someone have to be dying for me to call?&rdquo; Nat asked, an obvious smirk in her voice.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Usually.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well no one is dying,&rdquo; Nat confirmed,&nbsp;&ldquo;But I do <i>miss</i> you and I&rsquo;m trying to be more open and honest with the people I love, so I figured I&rsquo;d give you a call.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re going soft on me,&rdquo; you mused.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Only you, babe. So how&rsquo;s the trip?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Insufferable</i>,&rdquo; you grumbled,&nbsp;&ldquo;These kids are all stupid. They&rsquo;re trying their best, but the level of intellect is ghastly sometimes. I made a new friend named Betty. She&rsquo;s dating Ned so, obviously a keeper,&rdquo; you sighed, &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s all over my ass -&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m sure you <i>love</i> that,&rdquo; Nat chuckled, causing you to gasp.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Nat</i>!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just tell the boy you love him already,&rdquo; Nat groaned,&nbsp;&ldquo;We all have bets placed.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Well we do</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You were quiet for a moment and Nat allowed you to think before you sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s into someone else, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not know that. What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Perfect. She&rsquo;s smart. She makes him laugh and she knows when he&rsquo;s in a bad mood. She helps him &hellip; she likes books.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is this some sort of game where you describe yourself in third person? I&rsquo;ve been in a lot of therapy sessions but I&rsquo;ve never seen this exercise.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No! Nat -&rdquo; you groaned,&nbsp;&ldquo;I told him to go after her, because she definitely likes him. They deserve each other. They&rsquo;re good for each other.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God,&rdquo; Nat groaned,&nbsp;&ldquo;Teenagers are the fucking worst.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nat!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, listen, babe, I get that things have been really rough for you lately and I&rsquo;m not trying to sugarcoat anything or tell you that you aren&rsquo;t entitled to your own feelings, but you love that boy <i>so much</i> and I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone care for you the way that he does. He follows you around like a puppy whenever you&rsquo;re at the compound, and then he has no issue putting you in your place whenever you get a little too wild. He&rsquo;s so <i>good</i> for you, and you&rsquo;re <i>good</i> for him and I wish you would both just stop pining for one another and grow some balls and do something about it!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You didn&rsquo;t respond immediately, kicking at some loose stones in the street as you closed your eyes and attempted to not cry.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We just have a lot of history and &hellip; it&rsquo;s just really complicated,&rdquo; you finally said, sniffling a bit.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t give it a chance,&rdquo; Nat said firmly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to feel the love you know you deserve? Look, I&rsquo;ve got to go. Sam&rsquo;s being an asshole and I can hear him in the training room all the way from here in the kitchen. But just have fun, okay? And trust Peter. He&rsquo;s cared for you longer than you know. Don&rsquo;t be a wimp.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a -&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And have fun!&rdquo; Nat yelled before she hung up.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>God she was right, and that was the most frustrating part about it all. Nat always knew how to cut through the bullshit and be honest about what she had keenly observed. And maybe deep down you&rsquo;d always known Peter had feelings for you. It wasn&rsquo;t hard to deduct considering &hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever. Feelings were stupid. History made things complicated.</p><p>This was a conversation well overdue, and if it was going to happen then it would need to happen soon if anything was going to actually come from it. You weren&rsquo;t entirely sure where Peter had gotten up to after the cinema, but you had a feeling he would be back at the hotel rather soon, considering when he had a chance to have a full night&rsquo;s sleep he would take it without a second thought.&nbsp;</p><p>MJ wasn&rsquo;t back yet, and so you figured Peter wasn&rsquo;t either. Opening your laptop, you skated around some emails and some of the upcoming assignments for the field trip. You were halfway through your analysis of the film you&rsquo;d watched in correlation with the novel, when you heard a bump outside your door and a giggle.</p><p>The giggle was so foreign to you that you knew immediately it had to be MJ. You&rsquo;d never heard that girl giggle before in your entire goddamn life, and it was almost painful to hear it now considering you had a feeling you knew who it was because of.&nbsp;</p><p>Peeking your eye through the little peephole in the door, you were immediately met with Peter and MJ standing in front of Peter&rsquo;s door. They were both giggling, laughing about something Peter had whispered in MJ&rsquo;s ear as he was fishing for his key.&nbsp;</p><p>MJ went to say something, her fingertips trailing along his elbow, and Peter suddenly turned to look straight at her, no longer laughing as she continued to babble, unaware of his stare.</p><p>You&rsquo;d seen that stare before. You knew what that meant. Peter had had that stare when he&rsquo;d hooked up with Melissa Greyson at the end of junior year right before the field trip, and he&rsquo;d often stared at you that way whenever he thought you wouldn&rsquo;t notice.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; MJ laughed, a hushed word escaping her mouth before Peter had her in his arm - his one strong arm looped around her waist as she gasped and looked down at him, obviously shocked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter, what -&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can I -?&rdquo; Peter was obviously nervous, and your heart went out to the kid that he was finally doing something about this crush and yet was completely underwater and over his head.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,&rdquo; MJ said so quickly it even shocked you. Sure, you&rsquo;d known she liked the kid, but you&rsquo;d never pegged MJ as one to beg.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>His lips met hers and their eyes both closed and suddenly you wanted to turn away and vomit. Of course (because when in life was there not poorly timed conflict) Peter was just going to man up and kiss MJ <i>now</i>.</p><p><i>Of course.</i></p><p>Because you&rsquo;d told him too.&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing that MJ would be coming back to your room probably quite soon after their hasty hallway make out session, you were quick to put all your things away and jump into bed, rushing to flick the light off so it looked like you&rsquo;d been asleep for longer than the five seconds your heart was hammering in your chest while attempting to lie still.&nbsp;</p><p>And when the door finally did open and MJ came in, she of course figured you were asleep. Your back was to her, the lights were out, you had slowed down your rapid breathing enough that it was believable.&nbsp;</p><p>She was quick in prepping for bed too, so you didn&rsquo;t have to worry about blowing your cover for too long.&nbsp;</p><p>But what you should have been worried about, and what you hadn&rsquo;t even thought about in the heat of the moment, was the rapid beating and thundering of your heart, the adrenaline rushing through your body as you&rsquo;d tossed yourself around the room to prepare for MJ&rsquo;s entrance.&nbsp;</p><p>Because no one else would have ever known you were faking your slumber, heart aching and body screaming to tear the room apart. But even from across the hall, standing in the doorway of his own door wondering if he should follow up or not, Peter&rsquo;s ears and senses were tuned in to the rapid and steady pounding of your heart against your ribcage.&nbsp;</p><p>And though he&rsquo;d kissed MJ because he wanted to kiss MJ, it still made him feel a bit guilty that though he was happy about the kiss, he was a bit more interested in the fact that your heart pounding through his body had been the highlight of the night.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Were you jealous?</i> It was question you were attempting to not think about, and Peter was starting to wonder.&nbsp;</p><p>* * *</p><p><b><i>author&rsquo;s note: that was hella long and i know the timing of things and the countries aren&rsquo;t all accurate but this isn&rsquo;t supposed to be accurate to the movie because WHO KNOWS what&rsquo;s going to happen in the film !&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b><i>regardless, hella angst, flash isn&rsquo;t that bad of a guy ? and lol @ peter just being like #theworst but also #thebest. i wrote this over the course of like a week and a half, lol, so if y&rsquo;all want more &hellip; you may have to wait a hot sec. unless there&rsquo;s just this massive influx of messages (which i know there won&rsquo;t be hence the setting myself up for success here), then the next update may come in a bit OR not at all lol.</i></b></p><p><b><i>but for those of you who were asking for more, here&rsquo;s a bit of what would have been to come. i put the intro at the top with the link for those who have not have seen that this is technically part two of a&nbsp;&ldquo;series&rdquo; so hope you enjoy it all ! and i&rsquo;d love to know what you may have to say about my writing/the stories/the character/what you would love to see/what you&rsquo;d love to know more of ! so i&rsquo;ll put the feedback link below, along with a link to my ko-fi because ya gurl is a poor af archaeology student trying to survive college and &hellip; four jobs ain&rsquo;t enough lol.</i></b></p><p><b><i>thanks for all the support ! so freaking kind, every single one of ya.</i></b></p><h2><i><b><a href=\"https://hey-marlie.tumblr.com/ask\">i&rsquo;m a thirsty narcissistic hoe for feedback plz send me a message</a></b></i></h2><h2><b>donate: <i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2FG2G3J972%23&amp;t=NmMyMWNmNTA3YzYxOTMyMjgxZTVlMWIwYWI0MDY0YmNkZDczZmFiMixTd2dtMnBRdA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Ax66cc1hbY_oRucCuLnQAFw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fhey-marlie.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178706066881%2Fn-o-v-e-l-t-y-ch-5&amp;m=1\">buy marlie b a coffee ?</a></i></b></h2></p>",

Just calling to make sure we are still on for tonight. I got the movie selection; Breakfast Club, Goonies or Footloose. Call me back after the MOMA. Tell Ned I said hi! Bye!\u201d You hang up hoping Peter didn&rsquo;t forget about your date.</p><!-- more --><p>You&rsquo;ve been with Peter for only 5 months but you could tell he was the one. He always made you laugh and smile, surprised you with simple gifts like a rose or even a sandwich from Delmar\u2019s (that&rsquo;s where you had your first date because you were both really broke to go somewhere nice), he just made you happy, which is all you really wanted in life.<br/></p><p>Growing up in foster care, your life wasn&rsquo;t like Annie, except for the part where you get adopted by a billionaire. It was a hard knock life, your parents abandoned you at the park, you were there for 3 days before you left your spot because something in you said they would come back. So ever since then, you&rsquo;ve had major abandonment issues along with depression and anxiety. You developed all this at a young age, people didn&rsquo;t want to adopt a child with this many problems. But this all changed when Tony Stark and Pepper Potts adopted you. You finally felt accepted into the world. <br/></p><p>They adopted you when you were 13, which came as a shock because no one ever really adopts teens. You were so thankful that they did.<br/></p><p>Living with them for the first 2 months were hard because Tony would go on missions and Pepper would go to meetings and it gave you lots of anxiety that they might not come back. But each time they would leave they would reassure you that they would always come back.<br/></p><p>You never liked to be alone for long periods of time so you would usually go with Pepper to meetings and would hang out in the lobby until it was over.<br/></p><p>When Tony would come back from missions, long or short, he would make sure to come to your room to let you know he was home and that comforted you.<br/></p><p>Flash forward 2 years you and them kept up with that routine and it worked out great. But adding a boyfriend who also did crime fighting made your anxiety go out of whack. Every siren you heard thoughts would flood in \u2018It could be him in there\u2019. \u00a0<br/></p><p>To make you feel better Peter would zip past your window and leave cute little web notes or if you were up you would let him in and he\u2019d let you patch him up and you both would cuddle all night. <br/></p><p>You hear screaming and cars crashing you look outside and can&rsquo;t see anything but objects flying past the window. You turn the news on and see a huge donut looking spaceship hovering over New York. <br/></p><p>You run into Peppers office and you turn her TV on and she stands up in shock.<br/></p><p>20 minutes go by and the space ship blasts up into space. Pepper calls Tony.\u00a0 \u00a0 -Tony Oh my God are you alright? What&rsquo;s going on? - Y<i>eah, I&rsquo;m fine. I just think we have to push our 830 res.</i>\u00a0-Why? \u00a0-<i>just cause ill probably not make it back in awhile</i> -Tell me your not on that ship - \u00a0\u00a0<i>yeah</i> \u00a0-god no please \u00a0\u00a0-<i>honey I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t know what to say</i>- come back here. come back here right now.</p><p>The call breaks up and Pepper falls to her knees and cries. You go near her and hug her so tight both of you sobbing because both of you knew something terrible was going to happen. \u00a0<br/></p><p>You call Peter and just hoped he didn&rsquo;t follow Tony up there. The call went straight to voicemail. You call Ned, he answers. <br/></p><p>-Ned! Are you alright? -Yeah, I&rsquo;m okay we made it passed the bridge but everyone&rsquo;s parents want them to come home. -Ned! Is Peter with you? His phone is off and I&rsquo;m worried. ~ there was a long silence~ Ned is he with you!? - No, he went to help Mr. Stark fight those aliens. - I gotta go.<br/></p><p>You hang up quickly. Standing there in the middle of the living room you don&rsquo;t know what to do. You want to scream and cry but you do nothing. <br/></p><p>The night falls and you and Pepper are on the couch. Shes asleep from crying so much and you&rsquo;re just looking at all the polaroids you and Peter took on all your little dates. You took so many pictures you made an album. It made you smile when you saw him smiling. Your favorite one was when he took you to Coney Island and the two of you went on the Ferris Wheel and while you were taking a picture he asked you to be his girlfriend. What made you love it, even more, it was a photo of your reaction.</p><p>You were curled up in the sweater that still smelled like him. Vanilla. It made you cry. You waited all night for him to swing by and tell you he was okay. You waited for Tony to come into your room to tell you he was home. But they didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>You woke up early and made some coffee. You were hoping you didn&rsquo;t wake up Pepper but she walked into the kitchen and gave you a weak smile.<br/></p><p>You sat in the kitchen in silence. You didn&rsquo;t know what to say to her and she didn&rsquo;t know what to say to you. <br/></p><p>\u201cY/N. I just want you to know that Tony loves you and that Peter loves you.\u201d Pepper says as she strokes your face softly.<br/></p><p>You pull her into a hug and held her tightly. \u201cAnd I love you Y/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>The tight hug becomes nothing. You open your eyes and she was gone. Turned to dust.<br/></p><p>You look around and look outside. Cars crashing, planes falling out of the sky. People turning into dust. <br/></p><p>The peoples screams drown out as you fall to the ground. Anxiety forms all around you.<br/></p><p>Everyone you know is gone. Everyone you love is gone. Tony, Peter and now Pepper. <br/></p><p>They aren&rsquo;t coming back.<br/></p>",

Just calling to make sure we are still on for tonight. I got the movie selection; Breakfast Club, Goonies or Footloose. Call me back after the MOMA. Tell Ned I said hi! Bye!\u201d You hang up hoping Peter didn\u2019t forget about your date.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You\u2019ve been with Peter for only 5 months but you could tell he was the one. He always made you laugh and smile, surprised you with simple gifts like a rose or even a sandwich from Delmar\u2019s (that\u2019s where you had your first date because you were both really broke to go somewhere nice), he just made you happy, which is all you really wanted in life.<br></p><p>Growing up in foster care, your life wasn\u2019t like Annie, except for the part where you get adopted by a billionaire. It was a hard knock life, your parents abandoned you at the park, you were there for 3 days before you left your spot because something in you said they would come back. So ever since then, you\u2019ve had major abandonment issues along with depression and anxiety. You developed all this at a young age, people didn\u2019t want to adopt a child with this many problems. But this all changed when Tony Stark and Pepper Potts adopted you. You finally felt accepted into the world. <br></p><p>They adopted you when you were 13, which came as a shock because no one ever really adopts teens. You were so thankful that they did.<br></p><p>Living with them for the first 2 months were hard because Tony would go on missions and Pepper would go to meetings and it gave you lots of anxiety that they might not come back. But each time they would leave they would reassure you that they would always come back.<br></p><p>You never liked to be alone for long periods of time so you would usually go with Pepper to meetings and would hang out in the lobby until it was over.<br></p><p>When Tony would come back from missions, long or short, he would make sure to come to your room to let you know he was home and that comforted you.<br></p><p>Flash forward 2 years you and them kept up with that routine and it worked out great. But adding a boyfriend who also did crime fighting made your anxiety go out of whack. Every siren you heard thoughts would flood in \u2018It could be him in there\u2019. \u00a0<br></p><p>To make you feel better Peter would zip past your window and leave cute little web notes or if you were up you would let him in and he\u2019d let you patch him up and you both would cuddle all night. <br></p><p>You hear screaming and cars crashing you look outside and can\u2019t see anything but objects flying past the window. You turn the news on and see a huge donut looking spaceship hovering over New York. <br></p><p>You run into Peppers office and you turn her TV on and she stands up in shock.<br></p><p>20 minutes go by and the space ship blasts up into space. Pepper calls Tony.\u00a0 \u00a0 -Tony Oh my God are you alright? What\u2019s going on? - Y<i>eah, I\u2019m fine. I just think we have to push our 830 res.</i>\u00a0-Why? \u00a0-<i>just cause ill probably not make it back in awhile</i> -Tell me your not on that ship - \u00a0\u00a0<i>yeah</i> \u00a0-god no please \u00a0\u00a0-<i>honey I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know what to say</i>- come back here. come back here right now.</p><p>The call breaks up and Pepper falls to her knees and cries. You go near her and hug her so tight both of you sobbing because both of you knew something terrible was going to happen. \u00a0<br></p><p>You call Peter and just hoped he didn\u2019t follow Tony up there. The call went straight to voicemail. You call Ned, he answers. <br></p><p>-Ned! Are you alright? -Yeah, I\u2019m okay we made it passed the bridge but everyone\u2019s parents want them to come home. -Ned! Is Peter with you? His phone is off and I\u2019m worried. ~ there was a long silence~ Ned is he with you!? - No, he went to help Mr. Stark fight those aliens. - I gotta go.<br></p><p>You hang up quickly. Standing there in the middle of the living room you don\u2019t know what to do. You want to scream and cry but you do nothing. <br></p><p>The night falls and you and Pepper are on the couch. Shes asleep from crying so much and you\u2019re just looking at all the polaroids you and Peter took on all your little dates. You took so many pictures you made an album. It made you smile when you saw him smiling. Your favorite one was when he took you to Coney Island and the two of you went on the Ferris Wheel and while you were taking a picture he asked you to be his girlfriend. What made you love it, even more, it was a photo of your reaction.</p><p>You were curled up in the sweater that still smelled like him. Vanilla. It made you cry. You waited all night for him to swing by and tell you he was okay. You waited for Tony to come into your room to tell you he was home. But they didn\u2019t.</p><p>You woke up early and made some coffee. You were hoping you didn\u2019t wake up Pepper but she walked into the kitchen and gave you a weak smile.<br></p><p>You sat in the kitchen in silence. You didn\u2019t know what to say to her and she didn\u2019t know what to say to you. <br></p><p>\u201cY/N. I just want you to know that Tony loves you and that Peter loves you.\u201d Pepper says as she strokes your face softly.<br></p><p>You pull her into a hug and held her tightly. \u201cAnd I love you Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>The tight hug becomes nothing. You open your eyes and she was gone. Turned to dust.<br></p><p>You look around and look outside. Cars crashing, planes falling out of the sky. People turning into dust. <br></p><p>The peoples screams drown out as you fall to the ground. Anxiety forms all around you.<br></p><p>Everyone you know is gone. Everyone you love is gone. Tony, Peter and now Pepper. <br></p><p>They aren\u2019t coming back.<br></p>",
