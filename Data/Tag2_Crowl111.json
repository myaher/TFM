        "body": "<hr><p>I would find out much, much later, what all this future-talk meant, but at that point I was overtaken by overwhelming panic. Romance and love? Big fat red flags in my book. It\u2019s how I was lured before and I swore to myself that I\u2019d never let it happen again. </p>\n\n<p>I took a step back from the brothers. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEva, wait\u2014\u201c Sam started to say. </p>\n\n<p>I began moving faster towards the Continental. \u201cBoth of you just stay the <em>hell</em> away from me!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d automatically locked the door when I\u2019d gotten out, and since my brain had gone stupid all I ended up doing was yank uselessly at the handle. Someone put their hand on my arm and I instinctively swiveled around and punched its owner in the face. </p>\n\n<p>Dean Winchester staggered back a few steps and palmed his cheek. He whipped his gaze over to his brother. \u201cWhere the fuck did you pick <em>her</em> up?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOklahoma.\u201d I could swear Sam was trying not to laugh. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, Busty Asian Beauty she ain\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh. That tore it. I <em>hate</em> that magazine. My body was closer to Lucy Liu, the A-list actress, than Lucy Lee, the C-cup porn star, and I was tired of hunters trying to compare my more toned, small-breasted form to those squishy, silicone-enhanced inaccuracies. Time to take a stand. </p>\n\n<p>I walked up to Dean and stabbed him in the chest with my finger. \u201cYou listen to me, you dim-witted, inbred <em>hick</em>. I don\u2019t know what pool of <em>stupid</em> you crawled out of but I\u2019m not some starry-eyed slut that\u2019s going to fall into your arms just because you went and made up some sci-fi fairy tale!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t a fairy tale!\u201d Dean shouted down at me. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that someone flew you into the future where not only am I <em>dead</em>, but I\u2019d had some kind of relationship with your pretty-boy ass?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The conviction with which he said that single word took me by surprise. Either Sam\u2019s brother was a complete lunatic or\u2026 well, we\u2019re hunters. Weird and unusual is part of the gig. But time travel? That was stretching it. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d apparently stunned the man. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomething like this happened before,\u201d Sam offered. \u201cAngels have the power to transport people through time.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that? On your word alone?\u201d I threw my hands in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re both crazy! Why the hell did I let you drive me all this way after that shit last night? For all I know you two are psycho killer rapists!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>For some reason Dean took a good deal of umbrage against what I\u2019d accused him of. \u201cWe ain\u2019t psycho\u2026 killer\u2026 what you said!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEva,\u201d Sam said gently, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Everything. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she talkin\u2019 about, \u2018last night\u2019?\u201d Dean asked his brother. \u201cDid you two\u2026?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Both Sam and I vehemently cried, \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d Sam said to me, \u201cwe can still get you to Bobby\u2019s. It\u2019s maybe two hours out. After that, you don\u2019t have to see us ever again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His sentiments were wrong, but there was no way he could have known what was to come. Our lives would eventually become so intertwined it would be impossible to separate one from the other without creating tremendous, vacuous spaces. Regardless, I warily accepted the offer of transportation. \u201cLong as we\u2019re going straight there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean was giving his brother the stink-eye. Sam, thankfully, was unrelenting. \u201cDean, I promised.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d grumbled the pretty-boy. \u201cGet in the back, Xhang Xiyi.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I put him on the receiving end of one of my finest glares. \u201cI\u2019m not from China, I\u2019m from San Francisco. And I\u2019m <em>Korean</em>, asshole.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He threw up his hands in surrender and backed away. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>By the way, Dean still can\u2019t tell the difference. It\u2019s all tits and exoticism to him. </p>\n\n<hr><p>After Sam and I got our things we headed out. The tension in the car was thick; not only were the brothers still dealing with the issues had separated them, Dean was pointedly ignoring me. I had the feeling that he was embarrassed over his proclamation and was now pretending he\u2019d never said it. </p>\n\n<p>We arrived at Bobby\u2019s around noon. I escaped the car as soon as it had rolled to a stop, not bothering to wait for Dean to kill the engine. \u201cHey!\u201d he barked out the window. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I said loudly as I tore open the screen door and headed inside. </p>\n\n<p>I expected to be able to throw myself into Bobby\u2019s arms and give him a tremendously big hug. It had been several months since I\u2019d been able to visit and I was very fond of him. He was sitting behind his desk when I walked in the study and <em>rolled out</em> to greet me. Bobby Singer was wheelchair-bound and I had no idea when or how. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Before he could answer, Dean yanked me out of the room, nearly tearing my arm from its socket in the process. He shoved me up against the hallway wall and pressed one of his forearms against my neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you know not to go barging into people\u2019s houses like that?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLet me go. <em>Now</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d take heed, son,\u201d Bobby said. He sounded way too amused by the situation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d Dean asked incredulously. </p>\n\n<p>Bobby didn\u2019t bother answering. Instead, his eyes flicked downwards. When Dean complied with the silent request he found one of the small daggers I kept up my sleeves pointed directly at the V of his jeans. He grimaced at me. \u201cNow that\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe and Eva go back a ways,\u201d Bobby answered. \u201cNo need to get your undies in a bunch.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Reluctantly, Dean backed away. \u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d I snapped at him. In a far more sympathetic tone, I repeated my query to Bobby. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDemon,\u201d he replied succinctly as Sam came in bearing my saddlebags. \u201cGuess that thing down in Oklahoma didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSteve\u2019s dead,\u201d Sam said quietly. \u201cThe others got away.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStill don\u2019t explain why Eva didn\u2019t come here on her own wheels.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBecause those fuckers ran over my bike!\u201d I exclaimed. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOn purpose?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>On purpose</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDickhead move. What did you do?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, okay, he was right to assume it was my fault; Bobby knew my mouth tended to run faster than my brain. Except this time I had the upper hand. \u201cTim-fucking-Janklow sucker-punched me and then used me as bait!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBait for what?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d Sam replied. \u201cThey\u2026 Um\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo need, son. I get it.\u201d The gentleness in Bobby\u2019s tone was new to me. I\u2019d never seen him act so paternal to anyone other than me before. Most of his relationships with other hunters were purely professional, Rufus Turner being the exception. I suppose you could call Bobby and Rufus frenemies, if you were being generous. Cantankerous old grumps with grudges would be more accurate. </p>\n\n<p>The Winchesters, seeing that their duty to me was done, prepared to leave. They gave their farewells to Bobby and headed back to their car. I followed them to the porch. \u201cSam.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201dThanks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He gave me a smile. God, the man did and still does have the <em>cutest</em> little dimples. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSay,\u201d Dean inserted, \u201chow <em>do</em> you know Bobby?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d already told him to mind his business, but seeing the way Bobby acted around these two made me trust them a minuscule amount more. \u201cHe saved my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe does that a lot,\u201d Sam said as he opened the passenger\u2019s side door. \u201cWell, good luck with everything, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSee ya,\u201d was Dean\u2019s farewell. I waved, their engine turned over, and they were gone. </p>\n\n<p>I headed back inside. \u201cI don\u2019t got a new bike for you, darling,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cBut if you hang about I\u2019m sure one\u2019ll turn up. Unless you think you might head on home?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Home? I didn\u2019t have a home, not really. I had a place of origin, certainly, but San Francisco wasn\u2019t <em>home</em> anymore. The old, narrow house that I grew up in was sold, its blood-spattered walls covered with thick beige paint. I wonder if the new owners know about the history of horrors their million dollars granted them. \u201cCan I stay upstairs?\u201d I asked. \u201cI won\u2019t get in your way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBack in the old bedroom? Sure. You know, there\u2019s parts and frames all around the yard. Maybe you could cobble something together.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Put together some Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a motorcycle? \u201cThink I\u2019ll just wait.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSuit yourself. Room and board\u2019s same price as always.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHome cooked dinners and the occasional supply run. Got it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bobby smiled. \u201cGlad to have you back, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>We\u2019d had this arrangement, at this point, for about five years. I\u2019d get melancholy and need company, he\u2019d get sick of canned chili, and the two of us would be housemates up until one of us needed to get on the road. Unfortunately, with Bobby\u2019s debilitating condition the only one of us able to indulge in extracurricular activities was me, and he wasn\u2019t shy about showing how dejected he was about it. The man found relief by plugging himself into a bottle of whiskey. Hauling up a dead weight, middle-aged, belligerent alcoholic off the floor is about as easy and delightful as it sounds. </p>\n\n<p>He left at one point because of what he said was a witch. I was a little worried about the gleam in his eye, but I knew better than to pry. When Bobby got back, I was surprised to see that his spirits had risen. The older hunter merely said that he\u2019d had a change in perspective. </p>\n\n<p>A Triton motorcycle from the sixties came in shortly after the witch incident and finally answered my prayers. Some idiot had seen the handlebars and the seat as prime parts and had left the engine intact. It was going to take a bit of work, but that baby was going to be mine. </p>\n\n<p>Several weeks after meeting the weirdo Winchesters I was done fixing up the Triton. The day before I\u2019d done a test run and she moved like a <em>dream</em>. I was wiping the last bits of dirt and oil off it when Bobby rolled in. He gave an appreciative whistle. \u201cThat is one mighty fine lookin\u2019 bike.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I gave him a grin. \u201cNo backsies. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPromise is a promise.\u201d He scratched under his hat a bit, a sure sign that whatever he had on his mind was something that made him uncomfortable. \u201cLook, I got company coming and I don\u2019t think you wanna be here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I grabbed a rag and began cleaning my hands. \u201cWhat, embarrassed that some Asian chick is now King of the Scrapyard?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He snorted derisively. \u201cYou need a couple more decades of tinkering around here before I give up that title.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sam and Dean. They\u2019ll be here tonight.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ick. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I better get going.\u201d I sniffed under an armpit. \u201cDo I have time to get cleaned up?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMaybe. Depends on whether or not Dean or Sam is driving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBetter hurry then,\u201d I said as I started jogging towards the house. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d showered and dressed and was putting the last of my things into my saddlebags (of course I\u2019d gotten them replaced) when I heard a car pull up. I looked out of the window and spotted a truck. The woman getting out was around Bobby\u2019s age: Ellen Harvelle. She strode right in and I could vaguely hear her and Bobby greet one another. </p>\n\n<p>I knew the woman from when she\u2019d managed the Roadhouse, a great bar where hunters had gathered to swap info and stories. I used to swing by whenever I was near; it was nice to talk to a woman that didn\u2019t treat me like either a rival hunter or a stupid little girl that didn\u2019t belong. Her daughter, Jo, and I were on friendly terms through mutual association; we both liked her mother. The place had been demolished by a demon, so I was told, and I was happy to see Ellen alive and well.</p>\n\n<p>When I came down the stairs, bags in hand, I saw Bobby and Ellen in the kitchen talking quietly. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt; I\u2019d been brought up to respect my elders\u2019 privacy. That all went to hell when a low, gravelly voice said from behind me, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I immediately stepped forward and swung my saddlebags around to clobber whoever it was. My belongings smacked into the man\u2019s head before bursting from their confines and scattering everywhere. Apparently I hadn\u2019t closed them as tightly as I thought. Much to my irritation, the stranger didn\u2019t even flinch. I drew a fist back but was arrested by Ellen shouting, \u201cWhoa whoa whoa!\u201d as she came rushing over. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCass, you idjit!\u201d Bobby snapped as he followed her. </p>\n\n<p>I let my hand drop and peered at the newcomer. He was almost the same height as Bobby, a healthy six feet, with tousled dark hair and a set of <em>ancient</em> blue eyes. No standard hunter gear (jeans, shirt, flannel, boots); this guy had a trenchcoat, suit, tie, and even dress shoes. It was like being stared at by a weirdly intense accountant. A handsome accountant. Which made him even <em>more</em> weird. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d the man asked, this time directed at Bobby. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cEvangeline!\u201d Ellen cried warmly. She knew I didn\u2019t like being hugged and settled for patting my cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, more than a year at least. I gave her a smile. \u201cI missed you, too. Where\u2019s Jo?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be along soon. Out with those Winchester boys retrieving the Colt.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell whether the woman was proud or anxious that her daughter was out with those two freaks. </p>\n\n<p>Hold up. \u201cWait, the Colt?\u201d I asked, astonished. \u201c<em>The</em> Colt?\u201d Everyone knew about the magical gun wrought to kill everything. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOne and only. Were you heading out? It\u2019d be a shame if you two missed each other.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Evangeline\u2019,\u201d said the stranger in a thoughtful tone. \u201c\u2018Bringer of good news\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lifted an eyebrow without looking at him. \u201cSomeone want to tell me who special ed over here is?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat there\u2019s Castiel,\u201d Ellen replied. \u201cHe\u2019s an angel. It\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t exactly have a whole lot of what you\u2019d call \u2018social graces\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d the angel said testily. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, keep at it,\u201d I snapped. \u201cLearn that it\u2019s not nice to sneak up on a girl.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>So it wasn\u2019t love at first sight. That\u2019s for fairy tales and silly romantic movies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even <em>like</em> at first sight. All I came away with from this encounter was the impression that he was just another big dumb idiot. It would take months, years even, for Castiel to make a dent in that thick steel wall I\u2019d built around my heart, but when he did\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Bobby scolded, \u201cstop trying to piss him off. Didn\u2019t you wanna head out before Sam\u2019n\u2019Dean get here? Any minute now they\u2019re gonna be drivin\u2019 up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh shit. I immediately knelt down and started shoving things back into my saddlebags. The so-called angel stepped out of the way and Ellen joined me. I was still scrabbling for wayward arrows when the sound of an approaching engine came rumbling through Bobby\u2019s screen door. \u201cSweetie,\u201d Ellen whispered as she handed me a shirt, \u201cyou wanna tell me why you\u2019re running from the Winchesters?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo time,\u201d I answered as I zipped and buckled up. I hurried to the front door and swung it open\u2026 only to smack face first into someone\u2019s chest. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe hell\u2026?\u201d said its owner, one Dean Winchester. </p>\n\n<p>I shoved passed him, nearly knocking Sam and Jo down on the way, and walked as fast I could towards the shed and my bike. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, the dickhead followed me. \u201cEva!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I turned around after getting my bags attached. \u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor freaking you out last time! I shouldn\u2019t have told you\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My lip curled into a sneer. \u201cThat we were <em>destined</em> to be? That you\u2019re apparently going to be there holding me when I <em>die</em>?\u201d I walked over to the workbench and snatched up my helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Dean grabbed it out of my hands as soon as I got close enough. \u201cListen, we don\u2019t know the first thing about each other\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2014And so far the only things I know about you are that you\u2019re hot and you\u2019re freaking insane!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I breezed by the first thing he said and latched onto the second. \u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> insane?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The man gave an exasperated sigh and plunked my helmet onto the back of the Triton. \u201cLook, we\u2019re heading out tomorrow to take on Lucifer. Could use another hand.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I paused. This was important. Fighting ghouls and vampires wouldn\u2019t mean anything if Satan roasted the planet. I could be part of something big, something vital. It <em>could</em> be that my presence could mean the difference between someone living and someone dying. </p>\n\n<p>There were, however, two big issues with Dean\u2019s request, both of them having to do with him. For one, going up against Lucifer was suicide at best, and with Dean in attendance I had no intention of prophetically fulfilling my demise. For the other, there was no way I was going to dive into that handsome, green-eyed trap. Going into a life and death situation with the man would leave too many openings for him to show me that he was worth falling for. \u201cNo,\u201d I said as I swung one leg over onto my bike. </p>\n\n<p>Dean looked at me in disbelief, like I\u2019d told him I hated kittens or something. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated as I squished my head into my helmet. The engine purred when I turned the key and I revved the handle a few times to get Dean out of the way. He stepped back and I nearly broke the sound barrier getting away from him. </p>\n\n<hr><p>I didn\u2019t see the Winchesters again for several months after that, thankfully. The world didn\u2019t end but the Apocalypse kept on rolling, which meant that they\u2019d probably failed at stopping Lucifer. When I called Bobby about it a week later he broke the news that the Harvelles had died and confirmed my suspicions about the Winchesters\u2019 defeat.</p>\n\n<p>So much time and so many hunts passed that I figured I was done with those two idiots and put thoughts of them aside. In the weeks before it all went to shit there was a werewolf in Utah and a djinn in Vegas (selling \u201cdreams come true\u201d of all things). Afterwards I\u2019d headed to San Francisco and checked on my sister (still whoring it up on Geary), solved a haunting at Ghiradelli Square while I was there, drove up to Idaho for a pair of ghouls, swung all the way over to North Dakota for a nest of vamps (I <em>loathe</em> those assholes), and ended up in Blue Earth, Minnesota after hearing about a demon infestation.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s the saying? Hindsight is 20/20. If I had known how bad it was going to get I would have turned the fuck around. </p>\n\n<hr><p>Blue Earth had been taken over by the church. It\u2019s inevitable that when you deal with Heaven and Hell you get tangled up with religious nuts. This wasn\u2019t the first town like this I\u2019d encountered and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. The difference this time was that I\u2019d ridden willingly in and now I wasn\u2019t allowed out. </p>\n\n<p>The inability to go was more due to the abnormal amount of demons surrounding the perimeter than anything else. Anyone that tried to go by freeway ended up running into a blockade. Anyone trying to go through the woods ended up dead. </p>\n\n<p>I think I could have stood the isolationism if a lot of those people didn\u2019t start seriously freaking me the fuck out. In the past seventy-two hours I\u2019d gotten three marriage proposals, dozens of admonishments over my cleavage (you know, the minuscule amount that I had), and several lectures about my habit of using profanities. The latter two I could ignore, the first was unnerving. Couples were marching down that aisle every day, ones I suspected hadn\u2019t even considered the other person as a viable husband/wife prior to that morning. Unfortunately, this town had more men than women, which meant that the more I refused the more frowns were thrown my way. I slept with my blade in hand just in case someone decided to rouse me in the middle of the night for a shotgun wedding. </p>\n\n<p>The bartender, Paul, was the only person I could regularly stand to be around. We\u2019d even flirted a bit, but the watchful eye of Leah Gideon and the Sacrament Lutheran Militia kept us apart. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which: Leah Gideon, Prophet of the Lord, gave me the creeps. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but there was something about her that was just <em>off</em>. It made me want to stab her in the face. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re the Whore of Babylon masquerading as the pastor\u2019s daughter. </p>\n\n<p>The bar Paul ran was full from lunchtime to closing due to the fact that these people knew the Apocalypse was nigh. It was strange to be around non-hunters who talked about angels and demons casually, slipping them into conversations like some people do sports teams. I suppose with the actual hellspawn around the perimeter and the Prophet talking about her connection to Heaven they had a right to be casual and supercilious about the whole thing, but it didn\u2019t make it any less odd. </p>\n\n<p>Paul was pouring me another beer when <em>they</em> walked in. I\u2019d heard that strangers had rolled into town, demons hot on their tail, I just didn\u2019t expect it to be the Winchesters. There wasn\u2019t much I could do to hide (other than duck under a table), so I did what I could to keep my face pointed away from them. It <em>seemed</em> to work. Sam waltzed right on by while dialing a number on his phone and Dean plopped down at a table almost directly behind me. </p>\n\n<p>I waited to see how long the giant would stay on his call. Once he started talking to Castiel\u2019s voicemail (I didn\u2019t know it then, but for the crime of siding with humanity Cass had been cut off from Heaven\u2019s energy; thus the mundane communication method) I figured that was distraction enough for me to escape. I slapped a twenty down on the bar top, swiveled my stool, and took two steps towards the exit. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Shit. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeen a while, Eva,\u201d Dean continued. I turned around, my lips pressed tight. He was slouched in his seat facing the opposite wall and didn\u2019t bother changing positions. </p>\n\n<p>I folded my arms and glowered at the back of his head. \u201cNot long enough.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow long would that have to be?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was honestly hoping for, you know, forever.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean gave the peanuts a wry grin. \u201cYeah, well, me too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This was weird. At the time, I didn\u2019t know Dean very well, but I\u2019d gotten the impression from our two rather heated encounters that he was a little more\u2026 I don\u2019t know, alive? The way he sat, the way he spoke, it was as if whatever spark had once lit Dean Winchester had guttered out. It was disheartening, and pitiable. </p>\n\n<p>What had happened to him would have been devastating to anyone, really. Dean had basically found out God had said, in terms of the Apocalypse, \u201cFuck it. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d I\u2019m sure there were more nuances to the message He\u2019d left, but that was the gist. Before receiving that message, Dean had already been on a steady slide towards self immolation and God\u2019s apathy just steepened his descent. This shitstorm at Blue Earth would get him to smash right into the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>Sam slipped by me to sit down with three beers. He held one up to me and gave a small smile in greeting. I\u2019ve never been one to turn down free alcohol. \u201cHey, Eva,\u201d he said as I sat. \u201cCame here because of the same reason, I assume.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>He</em> was at least unchanged. I nodded. \u201cBeen here couple of days already.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sticking around that long?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of \u2018sticking around\u2019. It\u2019s a matter of \u2018I can\u2019t fucking leave\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam glanced at his brother who, I assumed, was supposed to glance back. Instead Dean kept drinking, his eye-line somewhere around his brother\u2019s stomach. </p>\n\n<p>This had passed awkward straight into excruciatingly uncomfortable. I decided to change the subject. \u201cWho were you calling?\u201d I asked (even though I already knew the answer). </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCass\u2014uh, Castiel. The angel? He said you guys met at Bobby\u2019s and you hit him with your stuff.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what he gets for sneaking up on me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe probably didn\u2019t sneak up so much as\u2026 <em>appeared</em> in that space.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGreat. Do they just pop up whenever? Should I expect angels to show up in my shower at some point?\u201d I was starting to wonder whether I could be alone and naked without fearing angelic intrusion. </p>\n\n<p>Sam gave a little chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026 well\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe bastards are junkless,\u201d Dean inserted. \u201cProbably see a woman\u2019s ass and wonder where her balls went.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I thought back to that first encounter with Castiel. Clueless and tactless. \u201cWell there\u2019s one less thing to worry about.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam took a swig of beer. \u201cSo any clues why the demons are circling this town in particular?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head. \u201cBest I could come up with was that they didn\u2019t want the Prophet slipping through their hands.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSounds reasonable.\u201d Sam shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the angels are making these people do their dirty work.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Both Dean and I asked, \u201cYeah? And?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam blinked disbelievingly at us. \u201cAnd they could get ripped to shreds!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got their stupid little exorcism chant,\u201d I retorted. \u201cNot to mention their phone line to Heaven. Believe me, these guys are a lot more prepared for slaughter than anyone else I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d Dean added dismissively. \u201cThese people ain\u2019t freaking out, they\u2019re runnin\u2019 to the exit in an orderly fashion. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s such a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho says they\u2019re all gonna die?\u201d Sam snapped back. \u201cWhatever happened to us saving them?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The church bells started ringing, cutting through whatever Dean was going to say (and also the biting remark I had in mind). I sighed and spent a few seconds chugging down the rest of my beer, a good three-quarters of the bottle. When I was done, I found both brothers goggling at me. Apparently girls in their world didn\u2019t really <em>drink</em>. \u201cWhat? Ding dongs mean Leah\u2019s had another vision. Time for church. You two coming?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know me,\u201d Dean said with a ghost of his former spunk. \u201cDownright pious.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>The Prophet had seen demons about five miles out all gathered nice and neat in an abandoned farmhouse. This all stank of setup and stupidity but it wasn\u2019t like anyone was going to listen to the drunk old maid who\u2019d rambled into town a few days ago. The only thing of any real consequence occurred when Pastor Gideon began the Lord\u2019s Prayer. \u201cOur Father, who art in Heaven\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean was right behind me. Under his breath he muttered, \u201cYeah, not so much.\u201d When I turned around, puzzled, he shifted, but didn\u2019t acknowledge my silent query. </p>\n\n<p>The raid itself went without a hitch. People running about chanting their little chant and black smoke flying out of the windows like someone had let loose really ugly balloons. It was <em>afterwards</em> when it all went to shit. </p>\n\n<p>Most of us had already left, me included. Sam and Dean had lingered and so had Dylan, the son of some locals (Rob and Jean? Jane?). Not all the demons had hightailed it as soon as the guns started going off; one had decided to hang out underneath the Winchesters\u2019 car. It pulled the young man underneath and slit his throat before the brothers could do shit. </p>\n\n<p>They came driving back, solemn as all hell, and quietly informed the others about Dylan\u2019s fate. His mother let out a terrible wail. I flinched, not at the mangled body in their back seat, but at that unearthly, devastating sound. I\u2019d seen a silent version under my grandparents\u2019 lips at my parents\u2019 wake. No one should live to bury their own child. </p>\n\n<p>Funerary services were hastily put together for that very evening. Sam, Dean, and I stood at the doorway of the church as it filled. We all felt as if going inside would be an unwelcome intrusion; after all, we were the only non-residents currently in town. A young man\u2019s death was too intimate a tragedy to barge in upon. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, Dylan\u2019s coffin passed by. His pallbearers, none of whom acknowledged our presence, appeared to be an uncle, grandfather, and several of his friends. Mother and father came stumbling up the steps shortly afterwards. I was staring at the grim wooden box when I heard Dean attempt to give his condolences. \u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019re just\u2026 very sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d the woman hissed through her tears, \u201cthis is <em>your</em> fault.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Her husband said her name quietly in admonishment (Jane! That was it), but before they could go any further, I stepped in front of Dean and snapped, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame him for a damn <em>demon</em>. What, you think he personally stuck that thing under his car just to fuck over your son?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to you,\u201d Jane snarled at me. \u201cBlasphemous, drunken <em>whore</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean grabbed my arm and pulled me away before I could smack the bitch. Dylan\u2019s father took the opportunity to hustle Jane inside. </p>\n\n<p>As Pastor Gideon began the service, I jerked my limb out of Dean\u2019s grip. He frowned at me. \u201cShe just lost her son,\u201d Dean scolded. \u201cLet her blame whoever she wants.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I threw my hands up and let them drop. This apathy of his was starting to grate on my nerves. \u201cThe fuck is wrong with you?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Before he could retort there was a commotion inside the church. Sam gestured us over. On the floor was Leah, seizing, her father making blandishments until the fit passed. When it did, Pastor Gideon helped his daughter sit up. \u201cDad,\u201d she gasped, \u201cit\u2019s Dylan.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust rest a minute, huh?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, listen! Dylan\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Leah Gideon, Prophet of the Lord, stood at the pulpit and promised paradise, including the inevitable reunion with lost loved ones\u2026 <em>if</em> we followed the angel\u2019s commandments. As I listened to her rattle off the list of demands my eyebrows crawled higher and higher. No gambling. No drinking. No premarital sex. In fact, no unmarried man or woman was allowed to be alone with the opposite gender without a church-sanctioned chaperone. Prayer morning, noon, and night. Curfew from nine to six. </p>\n\n<p>Dylan\u2019s parents, as well as a majority of the townsfolk, ate it up. Sam and I glanced at each other, astonished. I looked over and saw Paul staring at the girl in disbelief. Dean projected weary resignation. </p>\n\n<p>The brothers split up when the congregation finally dispersed. Dean went back inside to speak to whomever while Sam started walking towards the town\u2019s single motel. Paul had given me one of those sweet smiles of his as he\u2019d passed. Maybe we could start following the rules tomorrow instead\u2026?</p>\n\n<p>I headed for the bar. It was nearly dark, but unlike every other night I\u2019d been in town no one else came in. Whatever. It wasn\u2019t curfew yet and Paul was a local. He flipped the neon \u201copen\u201d sign and settled behind the counter. I swung myself onto what I had privately claimed as \u201cmy\u201d barstool and he plunked the usual down in front of me. </p>\n\n<p>A few minutes into my beer and Sam walked in. He greeted us both before sitting beside me. </p>\n\n<p>The boys bantered for a bit, Paul revealing the abrupt change in most of the town\u2019s attitudes once Leah had gone Prophet. He was the only person I knew that was outspoken about the obvious fraudulence underlying everyone\u2019s sudden piety. It\u2019s why I liked him best. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot a true believer, I take it,\u201d Paul said to Sam. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI believe, yeah. I do.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just pretty sure God stopped caring a long time ago.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We scoffed at the indifference of our supposed creator. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Sam asked me. </p>\n\n<p>I was on my third beer and my guard had slipped a bit. \u201cParents were devout. I believe that He\u2019s out there but I\u2019ll be damned if I give the son of a bitch the time of day.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Paul said. The three of us clinked mugs.</p>\n\n<p>We continued to drink until curfew. Paul and Sam talked about demons and television and sports while I munched on nuts and irregularly provided my opinions. It was a comfortable spot, cushioned by alcohol, and we drew a modicum of relief after the trials of the past twenty-four hours. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, shit wasn\u2019t done yet. I\u2019d been scrolling through news bits on my phone when my service abruptly died. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Sam. I showed him. He and Paul pulled out their own phones and, despite the varying carriers, found the same problem. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Paul grumbled. \u201cAnd it\u2019s \u2018curfew\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam groaned and staggered to his feet. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you two tomorrow then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We ribbed him for a bit about being a good little cultist before he left. Paul sighed and picked up Sam\u2019s empty mug. \u201cYou going too?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I gave him a (drunken) smile. \u201cYou want me to go?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He returned the expression, eyes dipping down to the skin I had peeking out from the V of my shirt and back up again. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I reached over to grab his button-up and pulled him close. \u201cThen what do you say you lock up that door, close the lights, and we see what happens?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d he replied huskily. </p>\n\n<hr><p>Sex with Paul was what I had come to expect from these small-town guys, but in his case the alliteration was in a good sense. See, when you live in a place where nearly everybody knows everybody most people end up having no more two or three sexual partners; the variety is lacking and the gossip is damning. These guys were, unfailingly so, inexperienced, with more clumsy enthusiasm than anything else. Wham, bam, thank you, ma\u2019am. </p>\n\n<p>Paul fell into that same, sorry category, but he had the exception of being gifted in both stamina and endowment. Good God, his was a dick to remember. He was sweet about the whole thing, too, getting all shy about putting on a condom and insisting on lapping at my folds until I was good and wet. I was the one who was pushing, eager to lose myself in the exertion, the alcohol not nearly enough to dull the effects of all the messed up shit that had gone down in the past eighteen hours. </p>\n\n<p>The man obliged, eventually, after he had slid himself deliciously inside of me. We were on the edge of one of the tables and I bit my lip as I gazed into his eyes, my hand gripping his shirt as my legs wrapped around his waist, before quietly requesting he get on with fucking me. Paul grinned, gave me a few experimentally harsh thrusts, before shunting that wonderful cock of his in and out of my cunt. </p>\n\n<p>We were just coming down, wrapped in post-coital bliss with his head resting between my breasts, when a rock came crashing through a window. I let out a shriek and he hurriedly drew away. Paul buttoned his pants back up as he went to investigate while I shoved my bra and shirt down and went looking for my jeans. I didn\u2019t find them before the door smashed in and a half dozen locals, spearheaded by Dylan\u2019s parents, marched in.</p>\n\n<p>My shirt was thankfully long enough to give me a shred of modesty, but it was obvious what we had been doing. Paul was still flushed and his buttons were askew while I was, well, pantsless. Jane\u2019s lip curled up at me. \u201cShe was right!\u201d the woman cried. \u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> the reason why the angels are angry at us! Fornicators! Unbelievers! Blasphemers!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I could have sworn we were in Blue Earth, Colorado, and not Castle Rock, Maine. \u201cWe\u2019re two consenting adults,\u201d I said as calmly as possible. \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat matters is that you are keeping us from joining our son!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Okay, that made absolutely no sense, but when Pastor Gideon came rushing in things started to click into place. \u201cPlease!\u201d he cried. \u201cCalm down. There\u2019s no reason to do this! Let\u2019s just talk it over.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe angels are angry, Pastor,\u201d said one of the other women. \u201cIf we want to enter paradise we need to be rid of these people!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey need to leave town <em>now</em>,\u201d Rob growled. \u201cThen we can tear apart this den of debauchery and lust.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A chorus of agreement swept through the group. Bolstered by the support, Rob lifted the bat and smashed it down on the nearest set of liquor bottles. Seeing his livelihood threatened, Paul grabbed the weapon and began grappling with his old friend. Pastor Gideon did his best to physically come between them while shouting for peace. </p>\n\n<p>Jane and another local woman tried to corner me into the bar. I still hadn\u2019t found my pants, goddamnit! \u201cTouch me,\u201d I warned, \u201cand I\u2019ll break your face.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>My bravado was swept away by apprehension when I saw Jane reach into her jacket. There was no mistaking the black object hidden within as anything other than the handle of a semiautomatic. I was contemplating ways of disarming her when a new voice asked, \u201cNeed some help, padre?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Fuck. Dean Winchester. I risked glancing over towards the doorway and saw the poster child for Prozac assessing the situation. My underdressed state made him blink but he was otherwise concerned by the rest. Pastor Gideon took advantage of the momentary lull in violence to plead, \u201cJust everybody cool down for a minute.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Cool down,\u2019 hmm?\u201d Paul repeated angrily. He turned towards Dean. \u201cMy <em>friends</em> are trying to run me out of town. Do you think I should \u2018cool down\u2019?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lost track of the ensuing conversation as I had, with great relief, <em>finally</em> caught sight of my missing jeans. I was inching towards them when I heard Paul say loudly, \u201cThis is my <em>home</em>. You want me out of here? You\u2019ll have to drag me out.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I snatched up my pants and held them close to my chest. Maybe I\u2019d get ten seconds in all this chaos to shove them back on. </p>\n\n<p>Or not. I was sliding my way to Paul\u2019s side when Dean abruptly slugged Rob. The Pastor shouted, \u201cNo no no\u2014 <em>stop</em> \u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>There were two loud reports. Something punched me in the stomach. </p>\n\n<p>Then nothing. </p>\n\n<hr><p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> : Some lines of dialogue are taken directly from the episode \u201c99 Problems\u201d (SPN 5.17). </p>",

            "comment": "<p><hr><p>I would find out much, much later, what all this future-talk meant, but at that point I was overtaken by overwhelming panic. Romance and love? Big fat red flags in my book. It\u2019s how I was lured before and I swore to myself that I\u2019d never let it happen again. </p>\n\n<p>I took a step back from the brothers. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEva, wait\u2014\u201c Sam started to say. </p>\n\n<p>I began moving faster towards the Continental. \u201cBoth of you just stay the <em>hell</em> away from me!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d automatically locked the door when I\u2019d gotten out, and since my brain had gone stupid all I ended up doing was yank uselessly at the handle. Someone put their hand on my arm and I instinctively swiveled around and punched its owner in the face. </p>\n\n<p>Dean Winchester staggered back a few steps and palmed his cheek. He whipped his gaze over to his brother. \u201cWhere the fuck did you pick <em>her</em> up?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOklahoma.\u201d I could swear Sam was trying not to laugh. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, Busty Asian Beauty she ain\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh. That tore it. I <em>hate</em> that magazine. My body was closer to Lucy Liu, the A-list actress, than Lucy Lee, the C-cup porn star, and I was tired of hunters trying to compare my more toned, small-breasted form to those squishy, silicone-enhanced inaccuracies. Time to take a stand. </p>\n\n<p>I walked up to Dean and stabbed him in the chest with my finger. \u201cYou listen to me, you dim-witted, inbred <em>hick</em>. I don\u2019t know what pool of <em>stupid</em> you crawled out of but I\u2019m not some starry-eyed slut that\u2019s going to fall into your arms just because you went and made up some sci-fi fairy tale!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t a fairy tale!\u201d Dean shouted down at me. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that someone flew you into the future where not only am I <em>dead</em>, but I\u2019d had some kind of relationship with your pretty-boy ass?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The conviction with which he said that single word took me by surprise. Either Sam\u2019s brother was a complete lunatic or\u2026 well, we\u2019re hunters. Weird and unusual is part of the gig. But time travel? That was stretching it. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d apparently stunned the man. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomething like this happened before,\u201d Sam offered. \u201cAngels have the power to transport people through time.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that? On your word alone?\u201d I threw my hands in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re both crazy! Why the hell did I let you drive me all this way after that shit last night? For all I know you two are psycho killer rapists!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>For some reason Dean took a good deal of umbrage against what I\u2019d accused him of. \u201cWe ain\u2019t psycho\u2026 killer\u2026 what you said!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEva,\u201d Sam said gently, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Everything. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she talkin\u2019 about, \u2018last night\u2019?\u201d Dean asked his brother. \u201cDid you two\u2026?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Both Sam and I vehemently cried, \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d Sam said to me, \u201cwe can still get you to Bobby\u2019s. It\u2019s maybe two hours out. After that, you don\u2019t have to see us ever again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His sentiments were wrong, but there was no way he could have known what was to come. Our lives would eventually become so intertwined it would be impossible to separate one from the other without creating tremendous, vacuous spaces. Regardless, I warily accepted the offer of transportation. \u201cLong as we\u2019re going straight there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean was giving his brother the stink-eye. Sam, thankfully, was unrelenting. \u201cDean, I promised.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d grumbled the pretty-boy. \u201cGet in the back, Xhang Xiyi.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I put him on the receiving end of one of my finest glares. \u201cI\u2019m not from China, I\u2019m from San Francisco. And I\u2019m <em>Korean</em>, asshole.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He threw up his hands in surrender and backed away. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>By the way, Dean still can\u2019t tell the difference. It\u2019s all tits and exoticism to him. </p>\n\n<hr><p>After Sam and I got our things we headed out. The tension in the car was thick; not only were the brothers still dealing with the issues had separated them, Dean was pointedly ignoring me. I had the feeling that he was embarrassed over his proclamation and was now pretending he\u2019d never said it. </p>\n\n<p>We arrived at Bobby\u2019s around noon. I escaped the car as soon as it had rolled to a stop, not bothering to wait for Dean to kill the engine. \u201cHey!\u201d he barked out the window. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I said loudly as I tore open the screen door and headed inside. </p>\n\n<p>I expected to be able to throw myself into Bobby\u2019s arms and give him a tremendously big hug. It had been several months since I\u2019d been able to visit and I was very fond of him. He was sitting behind his desk when I walked in the study and <em>rolled out</em> to greet me. Bobby Singer was wheelchair-bound and I had no idea when or how. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Before he could answer, Dean yanked me out of the room, nearly tearing my arm from its socket in the process. He shoved me up against the hallway wall and pressed one of his forearms against my neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you know not to go barging into people\u2019s houses like that?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLet me go. <em>Now</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d take heed, son,\u201d Bobby said. He sounded way too amused by the situation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d Dean asked incredulously. </p>\n\n<p>Bobby didn\u2019t bother answering. Instead, his eyes flicked downwards. When Dean complied with the silent request he found one of the small daggers I kept up my sleeves pointed directly at the V of his jeans. He grimaced at me. \u201cNow that\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe and Eva go back a ways,\u201d Bobby answered. \u201cNo need to get your undies in a bunch.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Reluctantly, Dean backed away. \u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d I snapped at him. In a far more sympathetic tone, I repeated my query to Bobby. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDemon,\u201d he replied succinctly as Sam came in bearing my saddlebags. \u201cGuess that thing down in Oklahoma didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSteve\u2019s dead,\u201d Sam said quietly. \u201cThe others got away.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStill don\u2019t explain why Eva didn\u2019t come here on her own wheels.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBecause those fuckers ran over my bike!\u201d I exclaimed. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOn purpose?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>On purpose</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDickhead move. What did you do?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, okay, he was right to assume it was my fault; Bobby knew my mouth tended to run faster than my brain. Except this time I had the upper hand. \u201cTim-fucking-Janklow sucker-punched me and then used me as bait!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBait for what?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d Sam replied. \u201cThey\u2026 Um\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo need, son. I get it.\u201d The gentleness in Bobby\u2019s tone was new to me. I\u2019d never seen him act so paternal to anyone other than me before. Most of his relationships with other hunters were purely professional, Rufus Turner being the exception. I suppose you could call Bobby and Rufus frenemies, if you were being generous. Cantankerous old grumps with grudges would be more accurate. </p>\n\n<p>The Winchesters, seeing that their duty to me was done, prepared to leave. They gave their farewells to Bobby and headed back to their car. I followed them to the porch. \u201cSam.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201dThanks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He gave me a smile. God, the man did and still does have the <em>cutest</em> little dimples. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSay,\u201d Dean inserted, \u201chow <em>do</em> you know Bobby?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d already told him to mind his business, but seeing the way Bobby acted around these two made me trust them a minuscule amount more. \u201cHe saved my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe does that a lot,\u201d Sam said as he opened the passenger\u2019s side door. \u201cWell, good luck with everything, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSee ya,\u201d was Dean\u2019s farewell. I waved, their engine turned over, and they were gone. </p>\n\n<p>I headed back inside. \u201cI don\u2019t got a new bike for you, darling,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cBut if you hang about I\u2019m sure one\u2019ll turn up. Unless you think you might head on home?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Home? I didn\u2019t have a home, not really. I had a place of origin, certainly, but San Francisco wasn\u2019t <em>home</em> anymore. The old, narrow house that I grew up in was sold, its blood-spattered walls covered with thick beige paint. I wonder if the new owners know about the history of horrors their million dollars granted them. \u201cCan I stay upstairs?\u201d I asked. \u201cI won\u2019t get in your way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBack in the old bedroom? Sure. You know, there\u2019s parts and frames all around the yard. Maybe you could cobble something together.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Put together some Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a motorcycle? \u201cThink I\u2019ll just wait.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSuit yourself. Room and board\u2019s same price as always.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHome cooked dinners and the occasional supply run. Got it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bobby smiled. \u201cGlad to have you back, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>We\u2019d had this arrangement, at this point, for about five years. I\u2019d get melancholy and need company, he\u2019d get sick of canned chili, and the two of us would be housemates up until one of us needed to get on the road. Unfortunately, with Bobby\u2019s debilitating condition the only one of us able to indulge in extracurricular activities was me, and he wasn\u2019t shy about showing how dejected he was about it. The man found relief by plugging himself into a bottle of whiskey. Hauling up a dead weight, middle-aged, belligerent alcoholic off the floor is about as easy and delightful as it sounds. </p>\n\n<p>He left at one point because of what he said was a witch. I was a little worried about the gleam in his eye, but I knew better than to pry. When Bobby got back, I was surprised to see that his spirits had risen. The older hunter merely said that he\u2019d had a change in perspective. </p>\n\n<p>A Triton motorcycle from the sixties came in shortly after the witch incident and finally answered my prayers. Some idiot had seen the handlebars and the seat as prime parts and had left the engine intact. It was going to take a bit of work, but that baby was going to be mine. </p>\n\n<p>Several weeks after meeting the weirdo Winchesters I was done fixing up the Triton. The day before I\u2019d done a test run and she moved like a <em>dream</em>. I was wiping the last bits of dirt and oil off it when Bobby rolled in. He gave an appreciative whistle. \u201cThat is one mighty fine lookin\u2019 bike.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I gave him a grin. \u201cNo backsies. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPromise is a promise.\u201d He scratched under his hat a bit, a sure sign that whatever he had on his mind was something that made him uncomfortable. \u201cLook, I got company coming and I don\u2019t think you wanna be here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I grabbed a rag and began cleaning my hands. \u201cWhat, embarrassed that some Asian chick is now King of the Scrapyard?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He snorted derisively. \u201cYou need a couple more decades of tinkering around here before I give up that title.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sam and Dean. They\u2019ll be here tonight.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ick. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I better get going.\u201d I sniffed under an armpit. \u201cDo I have time to get cleaned up?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMaybe. Depends on whether or not Dean or Sam is driving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBetter hurry then,\u201d I said as I started jogging towards the house. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d showered and dressed and was putting the last of my things into my saddlebags (of course I\u2019d gotten them replaced) when I heard a car pull up. I looked out of the window and spotted a truck. The woman getting out was around Bobby\u2019s age: Ellen Harvelle. She strode right in and I could vaguely hear her and Bobby greet one another. </p>\n\n<p>I knew the woman from when she\u2019d managed the Roadhouse, a great bar where hunters had gathered to swap info and stories. I used to swing by whenever I was near; it was nice to talk to a woman that didn\u2019t treat me like either a rival hunter or a stupid little girl that didn\u2019t belong. Her daughter, Jo, and I were on friendly terms through mutual association; we both liked her mother. The place had been demolished by a demon, so I was told, and I was happy to see Ellen alive and well.</p>\n\n<p>When I came down the stairs, bags in hand, I saw Bobby and Ellen in the kitchen talking quietly. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt; I\u2019d been brought up to respect my elders\u2019 privacy. That all went to hell when a low, gravelly voice said from behind me, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I immediately stepped forward and swung my saddlebags around to clobber whoever it was. My belongings smacked into the man\u2019s head before bursting from their confines and scattering everywhere. Apparently I hadn\u2019t closed them as tightly as I thought. Much to my irritation, the stranger didn\u2019t even flinch. I drew a fist back but was arrested by Ellen shouting, \u201cWhoa whoa whoa!\u201d as she came rushing over. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCass, you idjit!\u201d Bobby snapped as he followed her. </p>\n\n<p>I let my hand drop and peered at the newcomer. He was almost the same height as Bobby, a healthy six feet, with tousled dark hair and a set of <em>ancient</em> blue eyes. No standard hunter gear (jeans, shirt, flannel, boots); this guy had a trenchcoat, suit, tie, and even dress shoes. It was like being stared at by a weirdly intense accountant. A handsome accountant. Which made him even <em>more</em> weird. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d the man asked, this time directed at Bobby. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cEvangeline!\u201d Ellen cried warmly. She knew I didn\u2019t like being hugged and settled for patting my cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, more than a year at least. I gave her a smile. \u201cI missed you, too. Where\u2019s Jo?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be along soon. Out with those Winchester boys retrieving the Colt.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell whether the woman was proud or anxious that her daughter was out with those two freaks. </p>\n\n<p>Hold up. \u201cWait, the Colt?\u201d I asked, astonished. \u201c<em>The</em> Colt?\u201d Everyone knew about the magical gun wrought to kill everything. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOne and only. Were you heading out? It\u2019d be a shame if you two missed each other.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Evangeline\u2019,\u201d said the stranger in a thoughtful tone. \u201c\u2018Bringer of good news\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lifted an eyebrow without looking at him. \u201cSomeone want to tell me who special ed over here is?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat there\u2019s Castiel,\u201d Ellen replied. \u201cHe\u2019s an angel. It\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t exactly have a whole lot of what you\u2019d call \u2018social graces\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d the angel said testily. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, keep at it,\u201d I snapped. \u201cLearn that it\u2019s not nice to sneak up on a girl.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>So it wasn\u2019t love at first sight. That\u2019s for fairy tales and silly romantic movies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even <em>like</em> at first sight. All I came away with from this encounter was the impression that he was just another big dumb idiot. It would take months, years even, for Castiel to make a dent in that thick steel wall I\u2019d built around my heart, but when he did\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Bobby scolded, \u201cstop trying to piss him off. Didn\u2019t you wanna head out before Sam\u2019n\u2019Dean get here? Any minute now they\u2019re gonna be drivin\u2019 up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh shit. I immediately knelt down and started shoving things back into my saddlebags. The so-called angel stepped out of the way and Ellen joined me. I was still scrabbling for wayward arrows when the sound of an approaching engine came rumbling through Bobby\u2019s screen door. \u201cSweetie,\u201d Ellen whispered as she handed me a shirt, \u201cyou wanna tell me why you\u2019re running from the Winchesters?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo time,\u201d I answered as I zipped and buckled up. I hurried to the front door and swung it open\u2026 only to smack face first into someone\u2019s chest. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe hell\u2026?\u201d said its owner, one Dean Winchester. </p>\n\n<p>I shoved passed him, nearly knocking Sam and Jo down on the way, and walked as fast I could towards the shed and my bike. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, the dickhead followed me. \u201cEva!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I turned around after getting my bags attached. \u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor freaking you out last time! I shouldn\u2019t have told you\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My lip curled into a sneer. \u201cThat we were <em>destined</em> to be? That you\u2019re apparently going to be there holding me when I <em>die</em>?\u201d I walked over to the workbench and snatched up my helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Dean grabbed it out of my hands as soon as I got close enough. \u201cListen, we don\u2019t know the first thing about each other\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2014And so far the only things I know about you are that you\u2019re hot and you\u2019re freaking insane!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I breezed by the first thing he said and latched onto the second. \u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> insane?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The man gave an exasperated sigh and plunked my helmet onto the back of the Triton. \u201cLook, we\u2019re heading out tomorrow to take on Lucifer. Could use another hand.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I paused. This was important. Fighting ghouls and vampires wouldn\u2019t mean anything if Satan roasted the planet. I could be part of something big, something vital. It <em>could</em> be that my presence could mean the difference between someone living and someone dying. </p>\n\n<p>There were, however, two big issues with Dean\u2019s request, both of them having to do with him. For one, going up against Lucifer was suicide at best, and with Dean in attendance I had no intention of prophetically fulfilling my demise. For the other, there was no way I was going to dive into that handsome, green-eyed trap. Going into a life and death situation with the man would leave too many openings for him to show me that he was worth falling for. \u201cNo,\u201d I said as I swung one leg over onto my bike. </p>\n\n<p>Dean looked at me in disbelief, like I\u2019d told him I hated kittens or something. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated as I squished my head into my helmet. The engine purred when I turned the key and I revved the handle a few times to get Dean out of the way. He stepped back and I nearly broke the sound barrier getting away from him. </p>\n\n<hr><p>I didn\u2019t see the Winchesters again for several months after that, thankfully. The world didn\u2019t end but the Apocalypse kept on rolling, which meant that they\u2019d probably failed at stopping Lucifer. When I called Bobby about it a week later he broke the news that the Harvelles had died and confirmed my suspicions about the Winchesters\u2019 defeat.</p>\n\n<p>So much time and so many hunts passed that I figured I was done with those two idiots and put thoughts of them aside. In the weeks before it all went to shit there was a werewolf in Utah and a djinn in Vegas (selling \u201cdreams come true\u201d of all things). Afterwards I\u2019d headed to San Francisco and checked on my sister (still whoring it up on Geary), solved a haunting at Ghiradelli Square while I was there, drove up to Idaho for a pair of ghouls, swung all the way over to North Dakota for a nest of vamps (I <em>loathe</em> those assholes), and ended up in Blue Earth, Minnesota after hearing about a demon infestation.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s the saying? Hindsight is 20/20. If I had known how bad it was going to get I would have turned the fuck around. </p>\n\n<hr><p>Blue Earth had been taken over by the church. It\u2019s inevitable that when you deal with Heaven and Hell you get tangled up with religious nuts. This wasn\u2019t the first town like this I\u2019d encountered and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. The difference this time was that I\u2019d ridden willingly in and now I wasn\u2019t allowed out. </p>\n\n<p>The inability to go was more due to the abnormal amount of demons surrounding the perimeter than anything else. Anyone that tried to go by freeway ended up running into a blockade. Anyone trying to go through the woods ended up dead. </p>\n\n<p>I think I could have stood the isolationism if a lot of those people didn\u2019t start seriously freaking me the fuck out. In the past seventy-two hours I\u2019d gotten three marriage proposals, dozens of admonishments over my cleavage (you know, the minuscule amount that I had), and several lectures about my habit of using profanities. The latter two I could ignore, the first was unnerving. Couples were marching down that aisle every day, ones I suspected hadn\u2019t even considered the other person as a viable husband/wife prior to that morning. Unfortunately, this town had more men than women, which meant that the more I refused the more frowns were thrown my way. I slept with my blade in hand just in case someone decided to rouse me in the middle of the night for a shotgun wedding. </p>\n\n<p>The bartender, Paul, was the only person I could regularly stand to be around. We\u2019d even flirted a bit, but the watchful eye of Leah Gideon and the Sacrament Lutheran Militia kept us apart. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which: Leah Gideon, Prophet of the Lord, gave me the creeps. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but there was something about her that was just <em>off</em>. It made me want to stab her in the face. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re the Whore of Babylon masquerading as the pastor\u2019s daughter. </p>\n\n<p>The bar Paul ran was full from lunchtime to closing due to the fact that these people knew the Apocalypse was nigh. It was strange to be around non-hunters who talked about angels and demons casually, slipping them into conversations like some people do sports teams. I suppose with the actual hellspawn around the perimeter and the Prophet talking about her connection to Heaven they had a right to be casual and supercilious about the whole thing, but it didn\u2019t make it any less odd. </p>\n\n<p>Paul was pouring me another beer when <em>they</em> walked in. I\u2019d heard that strangers had rolled into town, demons hot on their tail, I just didn\u2019t expect it to be the Winchesters. There wasn\u2019t much I could do to hide (other than duck under a table), so I did what I could to keep my face pointed away from them. It <em>seemed</em> to work. Sam waltzed right on by while dialing a number on his phone and Dean plopped down at a table almost directly behind me. </p>\n\n<p>I waited to see how long the giant would stay on his call. Once he started talking to Castiel\u2019s voicemail (I didn\u2019t know it then, but for the crime of siding with humanity Cass had been cut off from Heaven\u2019s energy; thus the mundane communication method) I figured that was distraction enough for me to escape. I slapped a twenty down on the bar top, swiveled my stool, and took two steps towards the exit. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Shit. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeen a while, Eva,\u201d Dean continued. I turned around, my lips pressed tight. He was slouched in his seat facing the opposite wall and didn\u2019t bother changing positions. </p>\n\n<p>I folded my arms and glowered at the back of his head. \u201cNot long enough.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow long would that have to be?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was honestly hoping for, you know, forever.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean gave the peanuts a wry grin. \u201cYeah, well, me too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This was weird. At the time, I didn\u2019t know Dean very well, but I\u2019d gotten the impression from our two rather heated encounters that he was a little more\u2026 I don\u2019t know, alive? The way he sat, the way he spoke, it was as if whatever spark had once lit Dean Winchester had guttered out. It was disheartening, and pitiable. </p>\n\n<p>What had happened to him would have been devastating to anyone, really. Dean had basically found out God had said, in terms of the Apocalypse, \u201cFuck it. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d I\u2019m sure there were more nuances to the message He\u2019d left, but that was the gist. Before receiving that message, Dean had already been on a steady slide towards self immolation and God\u2019s apathy just steepened his descent. This shitstorm at Blue Earth would get him to smash right into the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>Sam slipped by me to sit down with three beers. He held one up to me and gave a small smile in greeting. I\u2019ve never been one to turn down free alcohol. \u201cHey, Eva,\u201d he said as I sat. \u201cCame here because of the same reason, I assume.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>He</em> was at least unchanged. I nodded. \u201cBeen here couple of days already.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sticking around that long?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of \u2018sticking around\u2019. It\u2019s a matter of \u2018I can\u2019t fucking leave\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam glanced at his brother who, I assumed, was supposed to glance back. Instead Dean kept drinking, his eye-line somewhere around his brother\u2019s stomach. </p>\n\n<p>This had passed awkward straight into excruciatingly uncomfortable. I decided to change the subject. \u201cWho were you calling?\u201d I asked (even though I already knew the answer). </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCass\u2014uh, Castiel. The angel? He said you guys met at Bobby\u2019s and you hit him with your stuff.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what he gets for sneaking up on me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe probably didn\u2019t sneak up so much as\u2026 <em>appeared</em> in that space.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGreat. Do they just pop up whenever? Should I expect angels to show up in my shower at some point?\u201d I was starting to wonder whether I could be alone and naked without fearing angelic intrusion. </p>\n\n<p>Sam gave a little chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026 well\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe bastards are junkless,\u201d Dean inserted. \u201cProbably see a woman\u2019s ass and wonder where her balls went.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I thought back to that first encounter with Castiel. Clueless and tactless. \u201cWell there\u2019s one less thing to worry about.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam took a swig of beer. \u201cSo any clues why the demons are circling this town in particular?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head. \u201cBest I could come up with was that they didn\u2019t want the Prophet slipping through their hands.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSounds reasonable.\u201d Sam shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the angels are making these people do their dirty work.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Both Dean and I asked, \u201cYeah? And?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam blinked disbelievingly at us. \u201cAnd they could get ripped to shreds!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got their stupid little exorcism chant,\u201d I retorted. \u201cNot to mention their phone line to Heaven. Believe me, these guys are a lot more prepared for slaughter than anyone else I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d Dean added dismissively. \u201cThese people ain\u2019t freaking out, they\u2019re runnin\u2019 to the exit in an orderly fashion. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s such a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho says they\u2019re all gonna die?\u201d Sam snapped back. \u201cWhatever happened to us saving them?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The church bells started ringing, cutting through whatever Dean was going to say (and also the biting remark I had in mind). I sighed and spent a few seconds chugging down the rest of my beer, a good three-quarters of the bottle. When I was done, I found both brothers goggling at me. Apparently girls in their world didn\u2019t really <em>drink</em>. \u201cWhat? Ding dongs mean Leah\u2019s had another vision. Time for church. You two coming?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know me,\u201d Dean said with a ghost of his former spunk. \u201cDownright pious.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>The Prophet had seen demons about five miles out all gathered nice and neat in an abandoned farmhouse. This all stank of setup and stupidity but it wasn\u2019t like anyone was going to listen to the drunk old maid who\u2019d rambled into town a few days ago. The only thing of any real consequence occurred when Pastor Gideon began the Lord\u2019s Prayer. \u201cOur Father, who art in Heaven\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean was right behind me. Under his breath he muttered, \u201cYeah, not so much.\u201d When I turned around, puzzled, he shifted, but didn\u2019t acknowledge my silent query. </p>\n\n<p>The raid itself went without a hitch. People running about chanting their little chant and black smoke flying out of the windows like someone had let loose really ugly balloons. It was <em>afterwards</em> when it all went to shit. </p>\n\n<p>Most of us had already left, me included. Sam and Dean had lingered and so had Dylan, the son of some locals (Rob and Jean? Jane?). Not all the demons had hightailed it as soon as the guns started going off; one had decided to hang out underneath the Winchesters\u2019 car. It pulled the young man underneath and slit his throat before the brothers could do shit. </p>\n\n<p>They came driving back, solemn as all hell, and quietly informed the others about Dylan\u2019s fate. His mother let out a terrible wail. I flinched, not at the mangled body in their back seat, but at that unearthly, devastating sound. I\u2019d seen a silent version under my grandparents\u2019 lips at my parents\u2019 wake. No one should live to bury their own child. </p>\n\n<p>Funerary services were hastily put together for that very evening. Sam, Dean, and I stood at the doorway of the church as it filled. We all felt as if going inside would be an unwelcome intrusion; after all, we were the only non-residents currently in town. A young man\u2019s death was too intimate a tragedy to barge in upon. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, Dylan\u2019s coffin passed by. His pallbearers, none of whom acknowledged our presence, appeared to be an uncle, grandfather, and several of his friends. Mother and father came stumbling up the steps shortly afterwards. I was staring at the grim wooden box when I heard Dean attempt to give his condolences. \u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019re just\u2026 very sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d the woman hissed through her tears, \u201cthis is <em>your</em> fault.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Her husband said her name quietly in admonishment (Jane! That was it), but before they could go any further, I stepped in front of Dean and snapped, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame him for a damn <em>demon</em>. What, you think he personally stuck that thing under his car just to fuck over your son?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to you,\u201d Jane snarled at me. \u201cBlasphemous, drunken <em>whore</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean grabbed my arm and pulled me away before I could smack the bitch. Dylan\u2019s father took the opportunity to hustle Jane inside. </p>\n\n<p>As Pastor Gideon began the service, I jerked my limb out of Dean\u2019s grip. He frowned at me. \u201cShe just lost her son,\u201d Dean scolded. \u201cLet her blame whoever she wants.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I threw my hands up and let them drop. This apathy of his was starting to grate on my nerves. \u201cThe fuck is wrong with you?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Before he could retort there was a commotion inside the church. Sam gestured us over. On the floor was Leah, seizing, her father making blandishments until the fit passed. When it did, Pastor Gideon helped his daughter sit up. \u201cDad,\u201d she gasped, \u201cit\u2019s Dylan.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust rest a minute, huh?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, listen! Dylan\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Leah Gideon, Prophet of the Lord, stood at the pulpit and promised paradise, including the inevitable reunion with lost loved ones\u2026 <em>if</em> we followed the angel\u2019s commandments. As I listened to her rattle off the list of demands my eyebrows crawled higher and higher. No gambling. No drinking. No premarital sex. In fact, no unmarried man or woman was allowed to be alone with the opposite gender without a church-sanctioned chaperone. Prayer morning, noon, and night. Curfew from nine to six. </p>\n\n<p>Dylan\u2019s parents, as well as a majority of the townsfolk, ate it up. Sam and I glanced at each other, astonished. I looked over and saw Paul staring at the girl in disbelief. Dean projected weary resignation. </p>\n\n<p>The brothers split up when the congregation finally dispersed. Dean went back inside to speak to whomever while Sam started walking towards the town\u2019s single motel. Paul had given me one of those sweet smiles of his as he\u2019d passed. Maybe we could start following the rules tomorrow instead\u2026?</p>\n\n<p>I headed for the bar. It was nearly dark, but unlike every other night I\u2019d been in town no one else came in. Whatever. It wasn\u2019t curfew yet and Paul was a local. He flipped the neon \u201copen\u201d sign and settled behind the counter. I swung myself onto what I had privately claimed as \u201cmy\u201d barstool and he plunked the usual down in front of me. </p>\n\n<p>A few minutes into my beer and Sam walked in. He greeted us both before sitting beside me. </p>\n\n<p>The boys bantered for a bit, Paul revealing the abrupt change in most of the town\u2019s attitudes once Leah had gone Prophet. He was the only person I knew that was outspoken about the obvious fraudulence underlying everyone\u2019s sudden piety. It\u2019s why I liked him best. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot a true believer, I take it,\u201d Paul said to Sam. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI believe, yeah. I do.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just pretty sure God stopped caring a long time ago.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We scoffed at the indifference of our supposed creator. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Sam asked me. </p>\n\n<p>I was on my third beer and my guard had slipped a bit. \u201cParents were devout. I believe that He\u2019s out there but I\u2019ll be damned if I give the son of a bitch the time of day.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Paul said. The three of us clinked mugs.</p>\n\n<p>We continued to drink until curfew. Paul and Sam talked about demons and television and sports while I munched on nuts and irregularly provided my opinions. It was a comfortable spot, cushioned by alcohol, and we drew a modicum of relief after the trials of the past twenty-four hours. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, shit wasn\u2019t done yet. I\u2019d been scrolling through news bits on my phone when my service abruptly died. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Sam. I showed him. He and Paul pulled out their own phones and, despite the varying carriers, found the same problem. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Paul grumbled. \u201cAnd it\u2019s \u2018curfew\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam groaned and staggered to his feet. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you two tomorrow then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We ribbed him for a bit about being a good little cultist before he left. Paul sighed and picked up Sam\u2019s empty mug. \u201cYou going too?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I gave him a (drunken) smile. \u201cYou want me to go?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He returned the expression, eyes dipping down to the skin I had peeking out from the V of my shirt and back up again. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I reached over to grab his button-up and pulled him close. \u201cThen what do you say you lock up that door, close the lights, and we see what happens?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d he replied huskily. </p>\n\n<hr><p>Sex with Paul was what I had come to expect from these small-town guys, but in his case the alliteration was in a good sense. See, when you live in a place where nearly everybody knows everybody most people end up having no more two or three sexual partners; the variety is lacking and the gossip is damning. These guys were, unfailingly so, inexperienced, with more clumsy enthusiasm than anything else. Wham, bam, thank you, ma\u2019am. </p>\n\n<p>Paul fell into that same, sorry category, but he had the exception of being gifted in both stamina and endowment. Good God, his was a dick to remember. He was sweet about the whole thing, too, getting all shy about putting on a condom and insisting on lapping at my folds until I was good and wet. I was the one who was pushing, eager to lose myself in the exertion, the alcohol not nearly enough to dull the effects of all the messed up shit that had gone down in the past eighteen hours. </p>\n\n<p>The man obliged, eventually, after he had slid himself deliciously inside of me. We were on the edge of one of the tables and I bit my lip as I gazed into his eyes, my hand gripping his shirt as my legs wrapped around his waist, before quietly requesting he get on with fucking me. Paul grinned, gave me a few experimentally harsh thrusts, before shunting that wonderful cock of his in and out of my cunt. </p>\n\n<p>We were just coming down, wrapped in post-coital bliss with his head resting between my breasts, when a rock came crashing through a window. I let out a shriek and he hurriedly drew away. Paul buttoned his pants back up as he went to investigate while I shoved my bra and shirt down and went looking for my jeans. I didn\u2019t find them before the door smashed in and a half dozen locals, spearheaded by Dylan\u2019s parents, marched in.</p>\n\n<p>My shirt was thankfully long enough to give me a shred of modesty, but it was obvious what we had been doing. Paul was still flushed and his buttons were askew while I was, well, pantsless. Jane\u2019s lip curled up at me. \u201cShe was right!\u201d the woman cried. \u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> the reason why the angels are angry at us! Fornicators! Unbelievers! Blasphemers!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I could have sworn we were in Blue Earth, Colorado, and not Castle Rock, Maine. \u201cWe\u2019re two consenting adults,\u201d I said as calmly as possible. \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat matters is that you are keeping us from joining our son!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Okay, that made absolutely no sense, but when Pastor Gideon came rushing in things started to click into place. \u201cPlease!\u201d he cried. \u201cCalm down. There\u2019s no reason to do this! Let\u2019s just talk it over.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe angels are angry, Pastor,\u201d said one of the other women. \u201cIf we want to enter paradise we need to be rid of these people!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey need to leave town <em>now</em>,\u201d Rob growled. \u201cThen we can tear apart this den of debauchery and lust.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A chorus of agreement swept through the group. Bolstered by the support, Rob lifted the bat and smashed it down on the nearest set of liquor bottles. Seeing his livelihood threatened, Paul grabbed the weapon and began grappling with his old friend. Pastor Gideon did his best to physically come between them while shouting for peace. </p>\n\n<p>Jane and another local woman tried to corner me into the bar. I still hadn\u2019t found my pants, goddamnit! \u201cTouch me,\u201d I warned, \u201cand I\u2019ll break your face.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>My bravado was swept away by apprehension when I saw Jane reach into her jacket. There was no mistaking the black object hidden within as anything other than the handle of a semiautomatic. I was contemplating ways of disarming her when a new voice asked, \u201cNeed some help, padre?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Fuck. Dean Winchester. I risked glancing over towards the doorway and saw the poster child for Prozac assessing the situation. My underdressed state made him blink but he was otherwise concerned by the rest. Pastor Gideon took advantage of the momentary lull in violence to plead, \u201cJust everybody cool down for a minute.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Cool down,\u2019 hmm?\u201d Paul repeated angrily. He turned towards Dean. \u201cMy <em>friends</em> are trying to run me out of town. Do you think I should \u2018cool down\u2019?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lost track of the ensuing conversation as I had, with great relief, <em>finally</em> caught sight of my missing jeans. I was inching towards them when I heard Paul say loudly, \u201cThis is my <em>home</em>. You want me out of here? You\u2019ll have to drag me out.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I snatched up my pants and held them close to my chest. Maybe I\u2019d get ten seconds in all this chaos to shove them back on. </p>\n\n<p>Or not. I was sliding my way to Paul\u2019s side when Dean abruptly slugged Rob. The Pastor shouted, \u201cNo no no\u2014 <em>stop</em> \u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>There were two loud reports. Something punched me in the stomach. </p>\n\n<p>Then nothing. </p>\n\n<hr><p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> : Some lines of dialogue are taken directly from the episode \u201c99 Problems\u201d (SPN 5.17). </p></p>",

Big fat red flags in my book. It\u2019s how I was lured before and I swore to myself that I\u2019d never let it happen again. </p>\n\n<p>I took a step back from the brothers. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEva, wait\u2014\u201c Sam started to say. </p>\n\n<p>I began moving faster towards the Continental. \u201cBoth of you just stay the <em>hell</em> away from me!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d automatically locked the door when I\u2019d gotten out, and since my brain had gone stupid all I ended up doing was yank uselessly at the handle. Someone put their hand on my arm and I instinctively swiveled around and punched its owner in the face. </p>\n\n<p>Dean Winchester staggered back a few steps and palmed his cheek. He whipped his gaze over to his brother. \u201cWhere the fuck did you pick <em>her</em> up?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOklahoma.\u201d I could swear Sam was trying not to laugh. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, Busty Asian Beauty she ain\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh. That tore it. I <em>hate</em> that magazine. My body was closer to Lucy Liu, the A-list actress, than Lucy Lee, the C-cup porn star, and I was tired of hunters trying to compare my more toned, small-breasted form to those squishy, silicone-enhanced inaccuracies. Time to take a stand. </p>\n\n<p>I walked up to Dean and stabbed him in the chest with my finger. \u201cYou listen to me, you dim-witted, inbred <em>hick</em>. I don\u2019t know what pool of <em>stupid</em> you crawled out of but I\u2019m not some starry-eyed slut that\u2019s going to fall into your arms just because you went and made up some sci-fi fairy tale!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t a fairy tale!\u201d Dean shouted down at me. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that someone flew you into the future where not only am I <em>dead</em>, but I\u2019d had some kind of relationship with your pretty-boy ass?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The conviction with which he said that single word took me by surprise. Either Sam\u2019s brother was a complete lunatic or\u2026 well, we\u2019re hunters. Weird and unusual is part of the gig. But time travel? That was stretching it. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d apparently stunned the man. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomething like this happened before,\u201d Sam offered. \u201cAngels have the power to transport people through time.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that? On your word alone?\u201d I threw my hands in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re both crazy! Why the hell did I let you drive me all this way after that shit last night? For all I know you two are psycho killer rapists!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>For some reason Dean took a good deal of umbrage against what I\u2019d accused him of. \u201cWe ain\u2019t psycho\u2026 killer\u2026 what you said!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEva,\u201d Sam said gently, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Everything. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she talkin\u2019 about, \u2018last night\u2019?\u201d Dean asked his brother. \u201cDid you two\u2026?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Both Sam and I vehemently cried, \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d Sam said to me, \u201cwe can still get you to Bobby\u2019s. It\u2019s maybe two hours out. After that, you don\u2019t have to see us ever again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His sentiments were wrong, but there was no way he could have known what was to come. Our lives would eventually become so intertwined it would be impossible to separate one from the other without creating tremendous, vacuous spaces. Regardless, I warily accepted the offer of transportation. \u201cLong as we\u2019re going straight there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean was giving his brother the stink-eye. Sam, thankfully, was unrelenting. \u201cDean, I promised.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d grumbled the pretty-boy. \u201cGet in the back, Xhang Xiyi.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I put him on the receiving end of one of my finest glares. \u201cI\u2019m not from China, I\u2019m from San Francisco. And I\u2019m <em>Korean</em>, asshole.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He threw up his hands in surrender and backed away. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>By the way, Dean still can\u2019t tell the difference. It\u2019s all tits and exoticism to him. </p>\n\n<hr><p>After Sam and I got our things we headed out. The tension in the car was thick; not only were the brothers still dealing with the issues had separated them, Dean was pointedly ignoring me. I had the feeling that he was embarrassed over his proclamation and was now pretending he\u2019d never said it. </p>\n\n<p>We arrived at Bobby\u2019s around noon. I escaped the car as soon as it had rolled to a stop, not bothering to wait for Dean to kill the engine. \u201cHey!\u201d he barked out the window. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I said loudly as I tore open the screen door and headed inside. </p>\n\n<p>I expected to be able to throw myself into Bobby\u2019s arms and give him a tremendously big hug. It had been several months since I\u2019d been able to visit and I was very fond of him. He was sitting behind his desk when I walked in the study and <em>rolled out</em> to greet me. Bobby Singer was wheelchair-bound and I had no idea when or how. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Before he could answer, Dean yanked me out of the room, nearly tearing my arm from its socket in the process. He shoved me up against the hallway wall and pressed one of his forearms against my neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you know not to go barging into people\u2019s houses like that?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLet me go. <em>Now</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d take heed, son,\u201d Bobby said. He sounded way too amused by the situation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d Dean asked incredulously. </p>\n\n<p>Bobby didn\u2019t bother answering. Instead, his eyes flicked downwards. When Dean complied with the silent request he found one of the small daggers I kept up my sleeves pointed directly at the V of his jeans. He grimaced at me. \u201cNow that\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe and Eva go back a ways,\u201d Bobby answered. \u201cNo need to get your undies in a bunch.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Reluctantly, Dean backed away. \u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d I snapped at him. In a far more sympathetic tone, I repeated my query to Bobby. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDemon,\u201d he replied succinctly as Sam came in bearing my saddlebags. \u201cGuess that thing down in Oklahoma didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSteve\u2019s dead,\u201d Sam said quietly. \u201cThe others got away.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStill don\u2019t explain why Eva didn\u2019t come here on her own wheels.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBecause those fuckers ran over my bike!\u201d I exclaimed. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOn purpose?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>On purpose</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDickhead move. What did you do?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, okay, he was right to assume it was my fault; Bobby knew my mouth tended to run faster than my brain. Except this time I had the upper hand. \u201cTim-fucking-Janklow sucker-punched me and then used me as bait!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBait for what?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d Sam replied. \u201cThey\u2026 Um\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo need, son. I get it.\u201d The gentleness in Bobby\u2019s tone was new to me. I\u2019d never seen him act so paternal to anyone other than me before. Most of his relationships with other hunters were purely professional, Rufus Turner being the exception. I suppose you could call Bobby and Rufus frenemies, if you were being generous. Cantankerous old grumps with grudges would be more accurate. </p>\n\n<p>The Winchesters, seeing that their duty to me was done, prepared to leave. They gave their farewells to Bobby and headed back to their car. I followed them to the porch. \u201cSam.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201dThanks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He gave me a smile. God, the man did and still does have the <em>cutest</em> little dimples. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSay,\u201d Dean inserted, \u201chow <em>do</em> you know Bobby?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d already told him to mind his business, but seeing the way Bobby acted around these two made me trust them a minuscule amount more. \u201cHe saved my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe does that a lot,\u201d Sam said as he opened the passenger\u2019s side door. \u201cWell, good luck with everything, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSee ya,\u201d was Dean\u2019s farewell. I waved, their engine turned over, and they were gone. </p>\n\n<p>I headed back inside. \u201cI don\u2019t got a new bike for you, darling,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cBut if you hang about I\u2019m sure one\u2019ll turn up. Unless you think you might head on home?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Home? I didn\u2019t have a home, not really. I had a place of origin, certainly, but San Francisco wasn\u2019t <em>home</em> anymore. The old, narrow house that I grew up in was sold, its blood-spattered walls covered with thick beige paint. I wonder if the new owners know about the history of horrors their million dollars granted them. \u201cCan I stay upstairs?\u201d I asked. \u201cI won\u2019t get in your way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBack in the old bedroom? Sure. You know, there\u2019s parts and frames all around the yard. Maybe you could cobble something together.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Put together some Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a motorcycle? \u201cThink I\u2019ll just wait.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSuit yourself. Room and board\u2019s same price as always.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHome cooked dinners and the occasional supply run. Got it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bobby smiled. \u201cGlad to have you back, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>We\u2019d had this arrangement, at this point, for about five years. I\u2019d get melancholy and need company, he\u2019d get sick of canned chili, and the two of us would be housemates up until one of us needed to get on the road. Unfortunately, with Bobby\u2019s debilitating condition the only one of us able to indulge in extracurricular activities was me, and he wasn\u2019t shy about showing how dejected he was about it. The man found relief by plugging himself into a bottle of whiskey. Hauling up a dead weight, middle-aged, belligerent alcoholic off the floor is about as easy and delightful as it sounds. </p>\n\n<p>He left at one point because of what he said was a witch. I was a little worried about the gleam in his eye, but I knew better than to pry. When Bobby got back, I was surprised to see that his spirits had risen. The older hunter merely said that he\u2019d had a change in perspective. </p>\n\n<p>A Triton motorcycle from the sixties came in shortly after the witch incident and finally answered my prayers. Some idiot had seen the handlebars and the seat as prime parts and had left the engine intact. It was going to take a bit of work, but that baby was going to be mine. </p>\n\n<p>Several weeks after meeting the weirdo Winchesters I was done fixing up the Triton. The day before I\u2019d done a test run and she moved like a <em>dream</em>. I was wiping the last bits of dirt and oil off it when Bobby rolled in. He gave an appreciative whistle. \u201cThat is one mighty fine lookin\u2019 bike.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I gave him a grin. \u201cNo backsies. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPromise is a promise.\u201d He scratched under his hat a bit, a sure sign that whatever he had on his mind was something that made him uncomfortable. \u201cLook, I got company coming and I don\u2019t think you wanna be here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I grabbed a rag and began cleaning my hands. \u201cWhat, embarrassed that some Asian chick is now King of the Scrapyard?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He snorted derisively. \u201cYou need a couple more decades of tinkering around here before I give up that title.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sam and Dean. They\u2019ll be here tonight.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ick. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I better get going.\u201d I sniffed under an armpit. \u201cDo I have time to get cleaned up?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMaybe. Depends on whether or not Dean or Sam is driving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBetter hurry then,\u201d I said as I started jogging towards the house. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d showered and dressed and was putting the last of my things into my saddlebags (of course I\u2019d gotten them replaced) when I heard a car pull up. I looked out of the window and spotted a truck. The woman getting out was around Bobby\u2019s age: Ellen Harvelle. She strode right in and I could vaguely hear her and Bobby greet one another. </p>\n\n<p>I knew the woman from when she\u2019d managed the Roadhouse, a great bar where hunters had gathered to swap info and stories. I used to swing by whenever I was near; it was nice to talk to a woman that didn\u2019t treat me like either a rival hunter or a stupid little girl that didn\u2019t belong. Her daughter, Jo, and I were on friendly terms through mutual association; we both liked her mother. The place had been demolished by a demon, so I was told, and I was happy to see Ellen alive and well.</p>\n\n<p>When I came down the stairs, bags in hand, I saw Bobby and Ellen in the kitchen talking quietly. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt; I\u2019d been brought up to respect my elders\u2019 privacy. That all went to hell when a low, gravelly voice said from behind me, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I immediately stepped forward and swung my saddlebags around to clobber whoever it was. My belongings smacked into the man\u2019s head before bursting from their confines and scattering everywhere. Apparently I hadn\u2019t closed them as tightly as I thought. Much to my irritation, the stranger didn\u2019t even flinch. I drew a fist back but was arrested by Ellen shouting, \u201cWhoa whoa whoa!\u201d as she came rushing over. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCass, you idjit!\u201d Bobby snapped as he followed her. </p>\n\n<p>I let my hand drop and peered at the newcomer. He was almost the same height as Bobby, a healthy six feet, with tousled dark hair and a set of <em>ancient</em> blue eyes. No standard hunter gear (jeans, shirt, flannel, boots); this guy had a trenchcoat, suit, tie, and even dress shoes. It was like being stared at by a weirdly intense accountant. A handsome accountant. Which made him even <em>more</em> weird. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d the man asked, this time directed at Bobby. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cEvangeline!\u201d Ellen cried warmly. She knew I didn\u2019t like being hugged and settled for patting my cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, more than a year at least. I gave her a smile. \u201cI missed you, too. Where\u2019s Jo?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be along soon. Out with those Winchester boys retrieving the Colt.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell whether the woman was proud or anxious that her daughter was out with those two freaks. </p>\n\n<p>Hold up. \u201cWait, the Colt?\u201d I asked, astonished. \u201c<em>The</em> Colt?\u201d Everyone knew about the magical gun wrought to kill everything. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOne and only. Were you heading out? It\u2019d be a shame if you two missed each other.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Evangeline\u2019,\u201d said the stranger in a thoughtful tone. \u201c\u2018Bringer of good news\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lifted an eyebrow without looking at him. \u201cSomeone want to tell me who special ed over here is?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat there\u2019s Castiel,\u201d Ellen replied. \u201cHe\u2019s an angel. It\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t exactly have a whole lot of what you\u2019d call \u2018social graces\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d the angel said testily. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, keep at it,\u201d I snapped. \u201cLearn that it\u2019s not nice to sneak up on a girl.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>So it wasn\u2019t love at first sight. That\u2019s for fairy tales and silly romantic movies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even <em>like</em> at first sight. All I came away with from this encounter was the impression that he was just another big dumb idiot. It would take months, years even, for Castiel to make a dent in that thick steel wall I\u2019d built around my heart, but when he did\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Bobby scolded, \u201cstop trying to piss him off. Didn\u2019t you wanna head out before Sam\u2019n\u2019Dean get here? Any minute now they\u2019re gonna be drivin\u2019 up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh shit. I immediately knelt down and started shoving things back into my saddlebags. The so-called angel stepped out of the way and Ellen joined me. I was still scrabbling for wayward arrows when the sound of an approaching engine came rumbling through Bobby\u2019s screen door. \u201cSweetie,\u201d Ellen whispered as she handed me a shirt, \u201cyou wanna tell me why you\u2019re running from the Winchesters?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo time,\u201d I answered as I zipped and buckled up. I hurried to the front door and swung it open\u2026 only to smack face first into someone\u2019s chest. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe hell\u2026?\u201d said its owner, one Dean Winchester. </p>\n\n<p>I shoved passed him, nearly knocking Sam and Jo down on the way, and walked as fast I could towards the shed and my bike. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, the dickhead followed me. \u201cEva!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I turned around after getting my bags attached. \u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor freaking you out last time! I shouldn\u2019t have told you\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My lip curled into a sneer. \u201cThat we were <em>destined</em> to be? That you\u2019re apparently going to be there holding me when I <em>die</em>?\u201d I walked over to the workbench and snatched up my helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Dean grabbed it out of my hands as soon as I got close enough. \u201cListen, we don\u2019t know the first thing about each other\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2014And so far the only things I know about you are that you\u2019re hot and you\u2019re freaking insane!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I breezed by the first thing he said and latched onto the second. \u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> insane?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The man gave an exasperated sigh and plunked my helmet onto the back of the Triton. \u201cLook, we\u2019re heading out tomorrow to take on Lucifer. Could use another hand.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I paused. This was important. Fighting ghouls and vampires wouldn\u2019t mean anything if Satan roasted the planet. I could be part of something big, something vital. It <em>could</em> be that my presence could mean the difference between someone living and someone dying. </p>\n\n<p>There were, however, two big issues with Dean\u2019s request, both of them having to do with him. For one, going up against Lucifer was suicide at best, and with Dean in attendance I had no intention of prophetically fulfilling my demise. For the other, there was no way I was going to dive into that handsome, green-eyed trap. Going into a life and death situation with the man would leave too many openings for him to show me that he was worth falling for. \u201cNo,\u201d I said as I swung one leg over onto my bike. </p>\n\n<p>Dean looked at me in disbelief, like I\u2019d told him I hated kittens or something. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated as I squished my head into my helmet. The engine purred when I turned the key and I revved the handle a few times to get Dean out of the way. He stepped back and I nearly broke the sound barrier getting away from him. </p>\n\n<hr><p>I didn\u2019t see the Winchesters again for several months after that, thankfully. The world didn\u2019t end but the Apocalypse kept on rolling, which meant that they\u2019d probably failed at stopping Lucifer. When I called Bobby about it a week later he broke the news that the Harvelles had died and confirmed my suspicions about the Winchesters\u2019 defeat.</p>\n\n<p>So much time and so many hunts passed that I figured I was done with those two idiots and put thoughts of them aside. In the weeks before it all went to shit there was a werewolf in Utah and a djinn in Vegas (selling \u201cdreams come true\u201d of all things). Afterwards I\u2019d headed to San Francisco and checked on my sister (still whoring it up on Geary), solved a haunting at Ghiradelli Square while I was there, drove up to Idaho for a pair of ghouls, swung all the way over to North Dakota for a nest of vamps (I <em>loathe</em> those assholes), and ended up in Blue Earth, Minnesota after hearing about a demon infestation.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s the saying? Hindsight is 20/20. If I had known how bad it was going to get I would have turned the fuck around. </p>\n\n<hr><p>Blue Earth had been taken over by the church. It\u2019s inevitable that when you deal with Heaven and Hell you get tangled up with religious nuts. This wasn\u2019t the first town like this I\u2019d encountered and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. The difference this time was that I\u2019d ridden willingly in and now I wasn\u2019t allowed out. </p>\n\n<p>The inability to go was more due to the abnormal amount of demons surrounding the perimeter than anything else. Anyone that tried to go by freeway ended up running into a blockade. Anyone trying to go through the woods ended up dead. </p>\n\n<p>I think I could have stood the isolationism if a lot of those people didn\u2019t start seriously freaking me the fuck out. In the past seventy-two hours I\u2019d gotten three marriage proposals, dozens of admonishments over my cleavage (you know, the minuscule amount that I had), and several lectures about my habit of using profanities. The latter two I could ignore, the first was unnerving. Couples were marching down that aisle every day, ones I suspected hadn\u2019t even considered the other person as a viable husband/wife prior to that morning. Unfortunately, this town had more men than women, which meant that the more I refused the more frowns were thrown my way. I slept with my blade in hand just in case someone decided to rouse me in the middle of the night for a shotgun wedding. </p>\n\n<p>The bartender, Paul, was the only person I could regularly stand to be around. We\u2019d even flirted a bit, but the watchful eye of Leah Gideon and the Sacrament Lutheran Militia kept us apart. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which: Leah Gideon, Prophet of the Lord, gave me the creeps. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but there was something about her that was just <em>off</em>. It made me want to stab her in the face. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re the Whore of Babylon masquerading as the pastor\u2019s daughter. </p>\n\n<p>The bar Paul ran was full from lunchtime to closing due to the fact that these people knew the Apocalypse was nigh. It was strange to be around non-hunters who talked about angels and demons casually, slipping them into conversations like some people do sports teams. I suppose with the actual hellspawn around the perimeter and the Prophet talking about her connection to Heaven they had a right to be casual and supercilious about the whole thing, but it didn\u2019t make it any less odd. </p>\n\n<p>Paul was pouring me another beer when <em>they</em> walked in. I\u2019d heard that strangers had rolled into town, demons hot on their tail, I just didn\u2019t expect it to be the Winchesters. There wasn\u2019t much I could do to hide (other than duck under a table), so I did what I could to keep my face pointed away from them. It <em>seemed</em> to work. Sam waltzed right on by while dialing a number on his phone and Dean plopped down at a table almost directly behind me. </p>\n\n<p>I waited to see how long the giant would stay on his call. Once he started talking to Castiel\u2019s voicemail (I didn\u2019t know it then, but for the crime of siding with humanity Cass had been cut off from Heaven\u2019s energy; thus the mundane communication method) I figured that was distraction enough for me to escape. I slapped a twenty down on the bar top, swiveled my stool, and took two steps towards the exit. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Shit. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeen a while, Eva,\u201d Dean continued. I turned around, my lips pressed tight. He was slouched in his seat facing the opposite wall and didn\u2019t bother changing positions. </p>\n\n<p>I folded my arms and glowered at the back of his head. \u201cNot long enough.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow long would that have to be?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was honestly hoping for, you know, forever.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean gave the peanuts a wry grin. \u201cYeah, well, me too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This was weird. At the time, I didn\u2019t know Dean very well, but I\u2019d gotten the impression from our two rather heated encounters that he was a little more\u2026 I don\u2019t know, alive? The way he sat, the way he spoke, it was as if whatever spark had once lit Dean Winchester had guttered out. It was disheartening, and pitiable. </p>\n\n<p>What had happened to him would have been devastating to anyone, really. Dean had basically found out God had said, in terms of the Apocalypse, \u201cFuck it. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d I\u2019m sure there were more nuances to the message He\u2019d left, but that was the gist. Before receiving that message, Dean had already been on a steady slide towards self immolation and God\u2019s apathy just steepened his descent. This shitstorm at Blue Earth would get him to smash right into the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>Sam slipped by me to sit down with three beers. He held one up to me and gave a small smile in greeting. I\u2019ve never been one to turn down free alcohol. \u201cHey, Eva,\u201d he said as I sat. \u201cCame here because of the same reason, I assume.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>He</em> was at least unchanged. I nodded. \u201cBeen here couple of days already.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sticking around that long?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of \u2018sticking around\u2019. It\u2019s a matter of \u2018I can\u2019t fucking leave\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam glanced at his brother who, I assumed, was supposed to glance back. Instead Dean kept drinking, his eye-line somewhere around his brother\u2019s stomach. </p>\n\n<p>This had passed awkward straight into excruciatingly uncomfortable. I decided to change the subject. \u201cWho were you calling?\u201d I asked (even though I already knew the answer). </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCass\u2014uh, Castiel. The angel? He said you guys met at Bobby\u2019s and you hit him with your stuff.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what he gets for sneaking up on me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe probably didn\u2019t sneak up so much as\u2026 <em>appeared</em> in that space.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGreat. Do they just pop up whenever? Should I expect angels to show up in my shower at some point?\u201d I was starting to wonder whether I could be alone and naked without fearing angelic intrusion. </p>\n\n<p>Sam gave a little chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026 well\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe bastards are junkless,\u201d Dean inserted. \u201cProbably see a woman\u2019s ass and wonder where her balls went.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I thought back to that first encounter with Castiel. Clueless and tactless. \u201cWell there\u2019s one less thing to worry about.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam took a swig of beer. \u201cSo any clues why the demons are circling this town in particular?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head. \u201cBest I could come up with was that they didn\u2019t want the Prophet slipping through their hands.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSounds reasonable.\u201d Sam shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the angels are making these people do their dirty work.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Both Dean and I asked, \u201cYeah? And?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam blinked disbelievingly at us. \u201cAnd they could get ripped to shreds!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got their stupid little exorcism chant,\u201d I retorted. \u201cNot to mention their phone line to Heaven. Believe me, these guys are a lot more prepared for slaughter than anyone else I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d Dean added dismissively. \u201cThese people ain\u2019t freaking out, they\u2019re runnin\u2019 to the exit in an orderly fashion. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s such a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho says they\u2019re all gonna die?\u201d Sam snapped back. \u201cWhatever happened to us saving them?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The church bells started ringing, cutting through whatever Dean was going to say (and also the biting remark I had in mind). I sighed and spent a few seconds chugging down the rest of my beer, a good three-quarters of the bottle. When I was done, I found both brothers goggling at me. Apparently girls in their world didn\u2019t really <em>drink</em>. \u201cWhat? Ding dongs mean Leah\u2019s had another vision. Time for church. You two coming?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know me,\u201d Dean said with a ghost of his former spunk. \u201cDownright pious.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>The Prophet had seen demons about five miles out all gathered nice and neat in an abandoned farmhouse. This all stank of setup and stupidity but it wasn\u2019t like anyone was going to listen to the drunk old maid who\u2019d rambled into town a few days ago. The only thing of any real consequence occurred when Pastor Gideon began the Lord\u2019s Prayer. \u201cOur Father, who art in Heaven\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean was right behind me. Under his breath he muttered, \u201cYeah, not so much.\u201d When I turned around, puzzled, he shifted, but didn\u2019t acknowledge my silent query. </p>\n\n<p>The raid itself went without a hitch. People running about chanting their little chant and black smoke flying out of the windows like someone had let loose really ugly balloons. It was <em>afterwards</em> when it all went to shit. </p>\n\n<p>Most of us had already left, me included. Sam and Dean had lingered and so had Dylan, the son of some locals (Rob and Jean? Jane?). Not all the demons had hightailed it as soon as the guns started going off; one had decided to hang out underneath the Winchesters\u2019 car. It pulled the young man underneath and slit his throat before the brothers could do shit. </p>\n\n<p>They came driving back, solemn as all hell, and quietly informed the others about Dylan\u2019s fate. His mother let out a terrible wail. I flinched, not at the mangled body in their back seat, but at that unearthly, devastating sound. I\u2019d seen a silent version under my grandparents\u2019 lips at my parents\u2019 wake. No one should live to bury their own child. </p>\n\n<p>Funerary services were hastily put together for that very evening. Sam, Dean, and I stood at the doorway of the church as it filled. We all felt as if going inside would be an unwelcome intrusion; after all, we were the only non-residents currently in town. A young man\u2019s death was too intimate a tragedy to barge in upon. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, Dylan\u2019s coffin passed by. His pallbearers, none of whom acknowledged our presence, appeared to be an uncle, grandfather, and several of his friends. Mother and father came stumbling up the steps shortly afterwards. I was staring at the grim wooden box when I heard Dean attempt to give his condolences. \u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019re just\u2026 very sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d the woman hissed through her tears, \u201cthis is <em>your</em> fault.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Her husband said her name quietly in admonishment (Jane! That was it), but before they could go any further, I stepped in front of Dean and snapped, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame him for a damn <em>demon</em>. What, you think he personally stuck that thing under his car just to fuck over your son?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to you,\u201d Jane snarled at me. \u201cBlasphemous, drunken <em>whore</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dean grabbed my arm and pulled me away before I could smack the bitch. Dylan\u2019s father took the opportunity to hustle Jane inside. </p>\n\n<p>As Pastor Gideon began the service, I jerked my limb out of Dean\u2019s grip. He frowned at me. \u201cShe just lost her son,\u201d Dean scolded. \u201cLet her blame whoever she wants.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I threw my hands up and let them drop. This apathy of his was starting to grate on my nerves. \u201cThe fuck is wrong with you?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Before he could retort there was a commotion inside the church. Sam gestured us over. On the floor was Leah, seizing, her father making blandishments until the fit passed. When it did, Pastor Gideon helped his daughter sit up. \u201cDad,\u201d she gasped, \u201cit\u2019s Dylan.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust rest a minute, huh?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, listen! Dylan\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Leah Gideon, Prophet of the Lord, stood at the pulpit and promised paradise, including the inevitable reunion with lost loved ones\u2026 <em>if</em> we followed the angel\u2019s commandments. As I listened to her rattle off the list of demands my eyebrows crawled higher and higher. No gambling. No drinking. No premarital sex. In fact, no unmarried man or woman was allowed to be alone with the opposite gender without a church-sanctioned chaperone. Prayer morning, noon, and night. Curfew from nine to six. </p>\n\n<p>Dylan\u2019s parents, as well as a majority of the townsfolk, ate it up. Sam and I glanced at each other, astonished. I looked over and saw Paul staring at the girl in disbelief. Dean projected weary resignation. </p>\n\n<p>The brothers split up when the congregation finally dispersed. Dean went back inside to speak to whomever while Sam started walking towards the town\u2019s single motel. Paul had given me one of those sweet smiles of his as he\u2019d passed. Maybe we could start following the rules tomorrow instead\u2026?</p>\n\n<p>I headed for the bar. It was nearly dark, but unlike every other night I\u2019d been in town no one else came in. Whatever. It wasn\u2019t curfew yet and Paul was a local. He flipped the neon \u201copen\u201d sign and settled behind the counter. I swung myself onto what I had privately claimed as \u201cmy\u201d barstool and he plunked the usual down in front of me. </p>\n\n<p>A few minutes into my beer and Sam walked in. He greeted us both before sitting beside me. </p>\n\n<p>The boys bantered for a bit, Paul revealing the abrupt change in most of the town\u2019s attitudes once Leah had gone Prophet. He was the only person I knew that was outspoken about the obvious fraudulence underlying everyone\u2019s sudden piety. It\u2019s why I liked him best. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot a true believer, I take it,\u201d Paul said to Sam. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI believe, yeah. I do.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just pretty sure God stopped caring a long time ago.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We scoffed at the indifference of our supposed creator. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Sam asked me. </p>\n\n<p>I was on my third beer and my guard had slipped a bit. \u201cParents were devout. I believe that He\u2019s out there but I\u2019ll be damned if I give the son of a bitch the time of day.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Paul said. The three of us clinked mugs.</p>\n\n<p>We continued to drink until curfew. Paul and Sam talked about demons and television and sports while I munched on nuts and irregularly provided my opinions. It was a comfortable spot, cushioned by alcohol, and we drew a modicum of relief after the trials of the past twenty-four hours. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, shit wasn\u2019t done yet. I\u2019d been scrolling through news bits on my phone when my service abruptly died. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Sam. I showed him. He and Paul pulled out their own phones and, despite the varying carriers, found the same problem. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Paul grumbled. \u201cAnd it\u2019s \u2018curfew\u2019.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam groaned and staggered to his feet. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you two tomorrow then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We ribbed him for a bit about being a good little cultist before he left. Paul sighed and picked up Sam\u2019s empty mug. \u201cYou going too?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I gave him a (drunken) smile. \u201cYou want me to go?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He returned the expression, eyes dipping down to the skin I had peeking out from the V of my shirt and back up again. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I reached over to grab his button-up and pulled him close. \u201cThen what do you say you lock up that door, close the lights, and we see what happens?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d he replied huskily. </p>\n\n<hr><p>Sex with Paul was what I had come to expect from these small-town guys, but in his case the alliteration was in a good sense. See, when you live in a place where nearly everybody knows everybody most people end up having no more two or three sexual partners; the variety is lacking and the gossip is damning. These guys were, unfailingly so, inexperienced, with more clumsy enthusiasm than anything else. Wham, bam, thank you, ma\u2019am. </p>\n\n<p>Paul fell into that same, sorry category, but he had the exception of being gifted in both stamina and endowment. Good God, his was a dick to remember. He was sweet about the whole thing, too, getting all shy about putting on a condom and insisting on lapping at my folds until I was good and wet. I was the one who was pushing, eager to lose myself in the exertion, the alcohol not nearly enough to dull the effects of all the messed up shit that had gone down in the past eighteen hours. </p>\n\n<p>The man obliged, eventually, after he had slid himself deliciously inside of me. We were on the edge of one of the tables and I bit my lip as I gazed into his eyes, my hand gripping his shirt as my legs wrapped around his waist, before quietly requesting he get on with fucking me. Paul grinned, gave me a few experimentally harsh thrusts, before shunting that wonderful cock of his in and out of my cunt. </p>\n\n<p>We were just coming down, wrapped in post-coital bliss with his head resting between my breasts, when a rock came crashing through a window. I let out a shriek and he hurriedly drew away. Paul buttoned his pants back up as he went to investigate while I shoved my bra and shirt down and went looking for my jeans. I didn\u2019t find them before the door smashed in and a half dozen locals, spearheaded by Dylan\u2019s parents, marched in.</p>\n\n<p>My shirt was thankfully long enough to give me a shred of modesty, but it was obvious what we had been doing. Paul was still flushed and his buttons were askew while I was, well, pantsless. Jane\u2019s lip curled up at me. \u201cShe was right!\u201d the woman cried. \u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> the reason why the angels are angry at us! Fornicators! Unbelievers! Blasphemers!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I could have sworn we were in Blue Earth, Colorado, and not Castle Rock, Maine. \u201cWe\u2019re two consenting adults,\u201d I said as calmly as possible. \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat matters is that you are keeping us from joining our son!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Okay, that made absolutely no sense, but when Pastor Gideon came rushing in things started to click into place. \u201cPlease!\u201d he cried. \u201cCalm down. There\u2019s no reason to do this! Let\u2019s just talk it over.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe angels are angry, Pastor,\u201d said one of the other women. \u201cIf we want to enter paradise we need to be rid of these people!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey need to leave town <em>now</em>,\u201d Rob growled. \u201cThen we can tear apart this den of debauchery and lust.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A chorus of agreement swept through the group. Bolstered by the support, Rob lifted the bat and smashed it down on the nearest set of liquor bottles. Seeing his livelihood threatened, Paul grabbed the weapon and began grappling with his old friend. Pastor Gideon did his best to physically come between them while shouting for peace. </p>\n\n<p>Jane and another local woman tried to corner me into the bar. I still hadn\u2019t found my pants, goddamnit! \u201cTouch me,\u201d I warned, \u201cand I\u2019ll break your face.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>My bravado was swept away by apprehension when I saw Jane reach into her jacket. There was no mistaking the black object hidden within as anything other than the handle of a semiautomatic. I was contemplating ways of disarming her when a new voice asked, \u201cNeed some help, padre?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Fuck. Dean Winchester. I risked glancing over towards the doorway and saw the poster child for Prozac assessing the situation. My underdressed state made him blink but he was otherwise concerned by the rest. Pastor Gideon took advantage of the momentary lull in violence to plead, \u201cJust everybody cool down for a minute.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Cool down,\u2019 hmm?\u201d Paul repeated angrily. He turned towards Dean. \u201cMy <em>friends</em> are trying to run me out of town. Do you think I should \u2018cool down\u2019?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lost track of the ensuing conversation as I had, with great relief, <em>finally</em> caught sight of my missing jeans. I was inching towards them when I heard Paul say loudly, \u201cThis is my <em>home</em>. You want me out of here? You\u2019ll have to drag me out.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I snatched up my pants and held them close to my chest. Maybe I\u2019d get ten seconds in all this chaos to shove them back on. </p>\n\n<p>Or not. I was sliding my way to Paul\u2019s side when Dean abruptly slugged Rob. The Pastor shouted, \u201cNo no no\u2014 <em>stop</em> \u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>There were two loud reports. Something punched me in the stomach. </p>\n\n<p>Then nothing. </p>\n\n<hr><p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> : Some lines of dialogue are taken directly from the episode \u201c99 Problems\u201d (SPN 5.17). </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><hr /><p>I would find out much, much later, what all this future-talk meant, but at that point I was overtaken by overwhelming panic. Romance and love? Big fat red flags in my book. It&rsquo;s how I was lured before and I swore to myself that I&rsquo;d never let it happen again. </p>\n\n<p>I took a step back from the brothers. &ldquo;Stay away from me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Eva, wait&mdash;&ldquo; Sam started to say. </p>\n\n<p>I began moving faster towards the Continental. &ldquo;Both of you just stay the <em>hell</em> away from me!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d automatically locked the door when I&rsquo;d gotten out, and since my brain had gone stupid all I ended up doing was yank uselessly at the handle. Someone put their hand on my arm and I instinctively swiveled around and punched its owner in the face. </p>\n\n<p>Dean Winchester staggered back a few steps and palmed his cheek. He whipped his gaze over to his brother. &ldquo;Where the fuck did you pick <em>her</em> up?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oklahoma.&rdquo; I could swear Sam was trying not to laugh. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, Busty Asian Beauty she ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Oh. That tore it. I <em>hate</em> that magazine. My body was closer to Lucy Liu, the A-list actress, than Lucy Lee, the C-cup porn star, and I was tired of hunters trying to compare my more toned, small-breasted form to those squishy, silicone-enhanced inaccuracies. Time to take a stand. </p>\n\n<p>I walked up to Dean and stabbed him in the chest with my finger. &ldquo;You listen to me, you dim-witted, inbred <em>hick</em>. I don&rsquo;t know what pool of <em>stupid</em> you crawled out of but I&rsquo;m not some starry-eyed slut that&rsquo;s going to fall into your arms just because you went and made up some sci-fi fairy tale!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a fairy tale!&rdquo; Dean shouted down at me. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You expect me to believe that someone flew you into the future where not only am I <em>dead</em>, but I&rsquo;d had some kind of relationship with your pretty-boy ass?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Yes</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The conviction with which he said that single word took me by surprise. Either Sam&rsquo;s brother was a complete lunatic or&hellip; well, we&rsquo;re hunters. Weird and unusual is part of the gig. But time travel? That was stretching it. &ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d apparently stunned the man. &ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Something like this happened before,&rdquo; Sam offered. &ldquo;Angels have the power to transport people through time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You expect me to believe that? On your word alone?&rdquo; I threw my hands in the air. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re both crazy! Why the hell did I let you drive me all this way after that shit last night? For all I know you two are psycho killer rapists!&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>For some reason Dean took a good deal of umbrage against what I&rsquo;d accused him of. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t psycho&hellip; killer&hellip; what you said!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Eva,&rdquo; Sam said gently, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Everything. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she talkin&rsquo; about, &lsquo;last night&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dean asked his brother. &ldquo;Did you two&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Both Sam and I vehemently cried, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Sam said to me, &ldquo;we can still get you to Bobby&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s maybe two hours out. After that, you don&rsquo;t have to see us ever again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>His sentiments were wrong, but there was no way he could have known what was to come. Our lives would eventually become so intertwined it would be impossible to separate one from the other without creating tremendous, vacuous spaces. Regardless, I warily accepted the offer of transportation. &ldquo;Long as we&rsquo;re going straight there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dean was giving his brother the stink-eye. Sam, thankfully, was unrelenting. &ldquo;Dean, I promised.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; grumbled the pretty-boy. &ldquo;Get in the back, Xhang Xiyi.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I put him on the receiving end of one of my finest glares. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not from China, I&rsquo;m from San Francisco. And I&rsquo;m <em>Korean</em>, asshole.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He threw up his hands in surrender and backed away. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>By the way, Dean still can&rsquo;t tell the difference. It&rsquo;s all tits and exoticism to him. </p>\n\n<hr /><p>After Sam and I got our things we headed out. The tension in the car was thick; not only were the brothers still dealing with the issues had separated them, Dean was pointedly ignoring me. I had the feeling that he was embarrassed over his proclamation and was now pretending he&rsquo;d never said it. </p>\n\n<p>We arrived at Bobby&rsquo;s around noon. I escaped the car as soon as it had rolled to a stop, not bothering to wait for Dean to kill the engine. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he barked out the window. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Fuck off,&rdquo; I said loudly as I tore open the screen door and headed inside. </p>\n\n<p>I expected to be able to throw myself into Bobby&rsquo;s arms and give him a tremendously big hug. It had been several months since I&rsquo;d been able to visit and I was very fond of him. He was sitting behind his desk when I walked in the study and <em>rolled out</em> to greet me. Bobby Singer was wheelchair-bound and I had no idea when or how. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Before he could answer, Dean yanked me out of the room, nearly tearing my arm from its socket in the process. He shoved me up against the hallway wall and pressed one of his forearms against my neck. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know not to go barging into people&rsquo;s houses like that?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Let me go. <em>Now</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take heed, son,&rdquo; Bobby said. He sounded way too amused by the situation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You know her?&rdquo; Dean asked incredulously. </p>\n\n<p>Bobby didn&rsquo;t bother answering. Instead, his eyes flicked downwards. When Dean complied with the silent request he found one of the small daggers I kept up my sleeves pointed directly at the V of his jeans. He grimaced at me. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just rude.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Me and Eva go back a ways,&rdquo; Bobby answered. &ldquo;No need to get your undies in a bunch.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Reluctantly, Dean backed away. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;None of your business,&rdquo; I snapped at him. In a far more sympathetic tone, I repeated my query to Bobby. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Demon,&rdquo; he replied succinctly as Sam came in bearing my saddlebags. &ldquo;Guess that thing down in Oklahoma didn&rsquo;t go so well.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; Sam said quietly. &ldquo;The others got away.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Still don&rsquo;t explain why Eva didn&rsquo;t come here on her own wheels.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Because those fuckers ran over my bike!&rdquo; I exclaimed. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;On purpose?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>On purpose</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Dickhead move. What did you do?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, okay, he was right to assume it was my fault; Bobby knew my mouth tended to run faster than my brain. Except this time I had the upper hand. &ldquo;Tim-fucking-Janklow sucker-punched me and then used me as bait!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Bait for what?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; Sam replied. &ldquo;They&hellip; Um&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No need, son. I get it.&rdquo; The gentleness in Bobby&rsquo;s tone was new to me. I&rsquo;d never seen him act so paternal to anyone other than me before. Most of his relationships with other hunters were purely professional, Rufus Turner being the exception. I suppose you could call Bobby and Rufus frenemies, if you were being generous. Cantankerous old grumps with grudges would be more accurate. </p>\n\n<p>The Winchesters, seeing that their duty to me was done, prepared to leave. They gave their farewells to Bobby and headed back to their car. I followed them to the porch. &ldquo;Sam.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&rdquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He gave me a smile. God, the man did and still does have the <em>cutest</em> little dimples. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; Dean inserted, &ldquo;how <em>do</em> you know Bobby?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d already told him to mind his business, but seeing the way Bobby acted around these two made me trust them a minuscule amount more. &ldquo;He saved my life.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;He does that a lot,&rdquo; Sam said as he opened the passenger&rsquo;s side door. &ldquo;Well, good luck with everything, Eva.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;See ya,&rdquo; was Dean&rsquo;s farewell. I waved, their engine turned over, and they were gone. </p>\n\n<p>I headed back inside. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t got a new bike for you, darling,&rdquo; Bobby said. &ldquo;But if you hang about I&rsquo;m sure one&rsquo;ll turn up. Unless you think you might head on home?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Home? I didn&rsquo;t have a home, not really. I had a place of origin, certainly, but San Francisco wasn&rsquo;t <em>home</em> anymore. The old, narrow house that I grew up in was sold, its blood-spattered walls covered with thick beige paint. I wonder if the new owners know about the history of horrors their million dollars granted them. &ldquo;Can I stay upstairs?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t get in your way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Back in the old bedroom? Sure. You know, there&rsquo;s parts and frames all around the yard. Maybe you could cobble something together.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Put together some Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster of a motorcycle? &ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ll just wait.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself. Room and board&rsquo;s same price as always.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Home cooked dinners and the occasional supply run. Got it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Bobby smiled. &ldquo;Glad to have you back, Eva.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<hr /><p>We&rsquo;d had this arrangement, at this point, for about five years. I&rsquo;d get melancholy and need company, he&rsquo;d get sick of canned chili, and the two of us would be housemates up until one of us needed to get on the road. Unfortunately, with Bobby&rsquo;s debilitating condition the only one of us able to indulge in extracurricular activities was me, and he wasn&rsquo;t shy about showing how dejected he was about it. The man found relief by plugging himself into a bottle of whiskey. Hauling up a dead weight, middle-aged, belligerent alcoholic off the floor is about as easy and delightful as it sounds. </p>\n\n<p>He left at one point because of what he said was a witch. I was a little worried about the gleam in his eye, but I knew better than to pry. When Bobby got back, I was surprised to see that his spirits had risen. The older hunter merely said that he&rsquo;d had a change in perspective. </p>\n\n<p>A Triton motorcycle from the sixties came in shortly after the witch incident and finally answered my prayers. Some idiot had seen the handlebars and the seat as prime parts and had left the engine intact. It was going to take a bit of work, but that baby was going to be mine. </p>\n\n<p>Several weeks after meeting the weirdo Winchesters I was done fixing up the Triton. The day before I&rsquo;d done a test run and she moved like a <em>dream</em>. I was wiping the last bits of dirt and oil off it when Bobby rolled in. He gave an appreciative whistle. &ldquo;That is one mighty fine lookin&rsquo; bike.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I gave him a grin. &ldquo;No backsies. She&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Promise is a promise.&rdquo; He scratched under his hat a bit, a sure sign that whatever he had on his mind was something that made him uncomfortable. &ldquo;Look, I got company coming and I don&rsquo;t think you wanna be here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I grabbed a rag and began cleaning my hands. &ldquo;What, embarrassed that some Asian chick is now King of the Scrapyard?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He snorted derisively. &ldquo;You need a couple more decades of tinkering around here before I give up that title.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sam and Dean. They&rsquo;ll be here tonight.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Ick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I better get going.&rdquo; I sniffed under an armpit. &ldquo;Do I have time to get cleaned up?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Depends on whether or not Dean or Sam is driving.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Better hurry then,&rdquo; I said as I started jogging towards the house. </p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d showered and dressed and was putting the last of my things into my saddlebags (of course I&rsquo;d gotten them replaced) when I heard a car pull up. I looked out of the window and spotted a truck. The woman getting out was around Bobby&rsquo;s age: Ellen Harvelle. She strode right in and I could vaguely hear her and Bobby greet one another. </p>\n\n<p>I knew the woman from when she&rsquo;d managed the Roadhouse, a great bar where hunters had gathered to swap info and stories. I used to swing by whenever I was near; it was nice to talk to a woman that didn&rsquo;t treat me like either a rival hunter or a stupid little girl that didn&rsquo;t belong. Her daughter, Jo, and I were on friendly terms through mutual association; we both liked her mother. The place had been demolished by a demon, so I was told, and I was happy to see Ellen alive and well.</p>\n\n<p>When I came down the stairs, bags in hand, I saw Bobby and Ellen in the kitchen talking quietly. I didn&rsquo;t want to interrupt; I&rsquo;d been brought up to respect my elders&rsquo; privacy. That all went to hell when a low, gravelly voice said from behind me, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I immediately stepped forward and swung my saddlebags around to clobber whoever it was. My belongings smacked into the man&rsquo;s head before bursting from their confines and scattering everywhere. Apparently I hadn&rsquo;t closed them as tightly as I thought. Much to my irritation, the stranger didn&rsquo;t even flinch. I drew a fist back but was arrested by Ellen shouting, &ldquo;Whoa whoa whoa!&rdquo; as she came rushing over. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Cass, you idjit!&rdquo; Bobby snapped as he followed her. </p>\n\n<p>I let my hand drop and peered at the newcomer. He was almost the same height as Bobby, a healthy six feet, with tousled dark hair and a set of <em>ancient</em> blue eyes. No standard hunter gear (jeans, shirt, flannel, boots); this guy had a trenchcoat, suit, tie, and even dress shoes. It was like being stared at by a weirdly intense accountant. A handsome accountant. Which made him even <em>more</em> weird. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; the man asked, this time directed at Bobby. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Evangeline!&rdquo; Ellen cried warmly. She knew I didn&rsquo;t like being hugged and settled for patting my cheeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, more than a year at least. I gave her a smile. &ldquo;I missed you, too. Where&rsquo;s Jo?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll be along soon. Out with those Winchester boys retrieving the Colt.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether the woman was proud or anxious that her daughter was out with those two freaks. </p>\n\n<p>Hold up. &ldquo;Wait, the Colt?&rdquo; I asked, astonished. &ldquo;<em>The</em> Colt?&rdquo; Everyone knew about the magical gun wrought to kill everything. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One and only. Were you heading out? It&rsquo;d be a shame if you two missed each other.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Evangeline&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the stranger in a thoughtful tone. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bringer of good news&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I lifted an eyebrow without looking at him. &ldquo;Someone want to tell me who special ed over here is?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That there&rsquo;s Castiel,&rdquo; Ellen replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an angel. It&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t exactly have a whole lot of what you&rsquo;d call &lsquo;social graces&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on it,&rdquo; the angel said testily. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, keep at it,&rdquo; I snapped. &ldquo;Learn that it&rsquo;s not nice to sneak up on a girl.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t love at first sight. That&rsquo;s for fairy tales and silly romantic movies. In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t even <em>like</em> at first sight. All I came away with from this encounter was the impression that he was just another big dumb idiot. It would take months, years even, for Castiel to make a dent in that thick steel wall I&rsquo;d built around my heart, but when he did&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; Bobby scolded, &ldquo;stop trying to piss him off. Didn&rsquo;t you wanna head out before Sam&rsquo;n&rsquo;Dean get here? Any minute now they&rsquo;re gonna be drivin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Oh shit. I immediately knelt down and started shoving things back into my saddlebags. The so-called angel stepped out of the way and Ellen joined me. I was still scrabbling for wayward arrows when the sound of an approaching engine came rumbling through Bobby&rsquo;s screen door. &ldquo;Sweetie,&rdquo; Ellen whispered as she handed me a shirt, &ldquo;you wanna tell me why you&rsquo;re running from the Winchesters?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No time,&rdquo; I answered as I zipped and buckled up. I hurried to the front door and swung it open&hellip; only to smack face first into someone&rsquo;s chest. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The hell&hellip;?&rdquo; said its owner, one Dean Winchester. </p>\n\n<p>I shoved passed him, nearly knocking Sam and Jo down on the way, and walked as fast I could towards the shed and my bike. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, the dickhead followed me. &ldquo;Eva!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I turned around after getting my bags attached. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I snapped. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For freaking you out last time! I shouldn&rsquo;t have told you&hellip; you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; My lip curled into a sneer. &ldquo;That we were <em>destined</em> to be? That you&rsquo;re apparently going to be there holding me when I <em>die</em>?&rdquo; I walked over to the workbench and snatched up my helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Dean grabbed it out of my hands as soon as I got close enough. &ldquo;Listen, we don&rsquo;t know the first thing about each other&mdash;&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re goddamn right.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And so far the only things I know about you are that you&rsquo;re hot and you&rsquo;re freaking insane!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I breezed by the first thing he said and latched onto the second. &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m</em> insane?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The man gave an exasperated sigh and plunked my helmet onto the back of the Triton. &ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;re heading out tomorrow to take on Lucifer. Could use another hand.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I paused. This was important. Fighting ghouls and vampires wouldn&rsquo;t mean anything if Satan roasted the planet. I could be part of something big, something vital. It <em>could</em> be that my presence could mean the difference between someone living and someone dying. </p>\n\n<p>There were, however, two big issues with Dean&rsquo;s request, both of them having to do with him. For one, going up against Lucifer was suicide at best, and with Dean in attendance I had no intention of prophetically fulfilling my demise. For the other, there was no way I was going to dive into that handsome, green-eyed trap. Going into a life and death situation with the man would leave too many openings for him to show me that he was worth falling for. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said as I swung one leg over onto my bike. </p>\n\n<p>Dean looked at me in disbelief, like I&rsquo;d told him I hated kittens or something. &ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I repeated as I squished my head into my helmet. The engine purred when I turned the key and I revved the handle a few times to get Dean out of the way. He stepped back and I nearly broke the sound barrier getting away from him. </p>\n\n<hr /><p>I didn&rsquo;t see the Winchesters again for several months after that, thankfully. The world didn&rsquo;t end but the Apocalypse kept on rolling, which meant that they&rsquo;d probably failed at stopping Lucifer. When I called Bobby about it a week later he broke the news that the Harvelles had died and confirmed my suspicions about the Winchesters&rsquo; defeat.</p>\n\n<p>So much time and so many hunts passed that I figured I was done with those two idiots and put thoughts of them aside. In the weeks before it all went to shit there was a werewolf in Utah and a djinn in Vegas (selling &ldquo;dreams come true&rdquo; of all things). Afterwards I&rsquo;d headed to San Francisco and checked on my sister (still whoring it up on Geary), solved a haunting at Ghiradelli Square while I was there, drove up to Idaho for a pair of ghouls, swung all the way over to North Dakota for a nest of vamps (I <em>loathe</em> those assholes), and ended up in Blue Earth, Minnesota after hearing about a demon infestation.</p>\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s the saying? Hindsight is 20/20. If I had known how bad it was going to get I would have turned the fuck around. </p>\n\n<hr /><p>Blue Earth had been taken over by the church. It&rsquo;s inevitable that when you deal with Heaven and Hell you get tangled up with religious nuts. This wasn&rsquo;t the first town like this I&rsquo;d encountered and it wouldn&rsquo;t be the last. The difference this time was that I&rsquo;d ridden willingly in and now I wasn&rsquo;t allowed out. </p>\n\n<p>The inability to go was more due to the abnormal amount of demons surrounding the perimeter than anything else. Anyone that tried to go by freeway ended up running into a blockade. Anyone trying to go through the woods ended up dead. </p>\n\n<p>I think I could have stood the isolationism if a lot of those people didn&rsquo;t start seriously freaking me the fuck out. In the past seventy-two hours I&rsquo;d gotten three marriage proposals, dozens of admonishments over my cleavage (you know, the minuscule amount that I had), and several lectures about my habit of using profanities. The latter two I could ignore, the first was unnerving. Couples were marching down that aisle every day, ones I suspected hadn&rsquo;t even considered the other person as a viable husband/wife prior to that morning. Unfortunately, this town had more men than women, which meant that the more I refused the more frowns were thrown my way. I slept with my blade in hand just in case someone decided to rouse me in the middle of the night for a shotgun wedding. </p>\n\n<p>The bartender, Paul, was the only person I could regularly stand to be around. We&rsquo;d even flirted a bit, but the watchful eye of Leah Gideon and the Sacrament Lutheran Militia kept us apart. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which: Leah Gideon, Prophet of the Lord, gave me the creeps. I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it, but there was something about her that was just <em>off</em>. It made me want to stab her in the face. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re the Whore of Babylon masquerading as the pastor&rsquo;s daughter. </p>\n\n<p>The bar Paul ran was full from lunchtime to closing due to the fact that these people knew the Apocalypse was nigh. It was strange to be around non-hunters who talked about angels and demons casually, slipping them into conversations like some people do sports teams. I suppose with the actual hellspawn around the perimeter and the Prophet talking about her connection to Heaven they had a right to be casual and supercilious about the whole thing, but it didn&rsquo;t make it any less odd. </p>\n\n<p>Paul was pouring me another beer when <em>they</em> walked in. I&rsquo;d heard that strangers had rolled into town, demons hot on their tail, I just didn&rsquo;t expect it to be the Winchesters. There wasn&rsquo;t much I could do to hide (other than duck under a table), so I did what I could to keep my face pointed away from them. It <em>seemed</em> to work. Sam waltzed right on by while dialing a number on his phone and Dean plopped down at a table almost directly behind me. </p>\n\n<p>I waited to see how long the giant would stay on his call. Once he started talking to Castiel&rsquo;s voicemail (I didn&rsquo;t know it then, but for the crime of siding with humanity Cass had been cut off from Heaven&rsquo;s energy; thus the mundane communication method) I figured that was distraction enough for me to escape. I slapped a twenty down on the bar top, swiveled my stool, and took two steps towards the exit. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t see you there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Shit. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Been a while, Eva,&rdquo; Dean continued. I turned around, my lips pressed tight. He was slouched in his seat facing the opposite wall and didn&rsquo;t bother changing positions. </p>\n\n<p>I folded my arms and glowered at the back of his head. &ldquo;Not long enough.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;How long would that have to be?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was honestly hoping for, you know, forever.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dean gave the peanuts a wry grin. &ldquo;Yeah, well, me too.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This was weird. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t know Dean very well, but I&rsquo;d gotten the impression from our two rather heated encounters that he was a little more&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, alive? The way he sat, the way he spoke, it was as if whatever spark had once lit Dean Winchester had guttered out. It was disheartening, and pitiable. </p>\n\n<p>What had happened to him would have been devastating to anyone, really. Dean had basically found out God had said, in terms of the Apocalypse, &ldquo;Fuck it. You&rsquo;re on your own.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure there were more nuances to the message He&rsquo;d left, but that was the gist. Before receiving that message, Dean had already been on a steady slide towards self immolation and God&rsquo;s apathy just steepened his descent. This shitstorm at Blue Earth would get him to smash right into the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>Sam slipped by me to sit down with three beers. He held one up to me and gave a small smile in greeting. I&rsquo;ve never been one to turn down free alcohol. &ldquo;Hey, Eva,&rdquo; he said as I sat. &ldquo;Came here because of the same reason, I assume.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>He</em> was at least unchanged. I nodded. &ldquo;Been here couple of days already.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been sticking around that long?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a matter of &lsquo;sticking around&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a matter of &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t fucking leave&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam glanced at his brother who, I assumed, was supposed to glance back. Instead Dean kept drinking, his eye-line somewhere around his brother&rsquo;s stomach. </p>\n\n<p>This had passed awkward straight into excruciatingly uncomfortable. I decided to change the subject. &ldquo;Who were you calling?&rdquo; I asked (even though I already knew the answer). </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Cass&mdash;uh, Castiel. The angel? He said you guys met at Bobby&rsquo;s and you hit him with your stuff.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he gets for sneaking up on me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;He probably didn&rsquo;t sneak up so much as&hellip; <em>appeared</em> in that space.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Great. Do they just pop up whenever? Should I expect angels to show up in my shower at some point?&rdquo; I was starting to wonder whether I could be alone and naked without fearing angelic intrusion. </p>\n\n<p>Sam gave a little chuckle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think&hellip; well&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The bastards are junkless,&rdquo; Dean inserted. &ldquo;Probably see a woman&rsquo;s ass and wonder where her balls went.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I thought back to that first encounter with Castiel. Clueless and tactless. &ldquo;Well there&rsquo;s one less thing to worry about.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam took a swig of beer. &ldquo;So any clues why the demons are circling this town in particular?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head. &ldquo;Best I could come up with was that they didn&rsquo;t want the Prophet slipping through their hands.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sounds reasonable.&rdquo; Sam shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe the angels are making these people do their dirty work.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Both Dean and I asked, &ldquo;Yeah? And?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam blinked disbelievingly at us. &ldquo;And they could get ripped to shreds!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got their stupid little exorcism chant,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;Not to mention their phone line to Heaven. Believe me, these guys are a lot more prepared for slaughter than anyone else I&rsquo;ve met.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end of the world,&rdquo; Dean added dismissively. &ldquo;These people ain&rsquo;t freaking out, they&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; to the exit in an orderly fashion. I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s such a bad thing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Who says they&rsquo;re all gonna die?&rdquo; Sam snapped back. &ldquo;Whatever happened to us saving them?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The church bells started ringing, cutting through whatever Dean was going to say (and also the biting remark I had in mind). I sighed and spent a few seconds chugging down the rest of my beer, a good three-quarters of the bottle. When I was done, I found both brothers goggling at me. Apparently girls in their world didn&rsquo;t really <em>drink</em>. &ldquo;What? Ding dongs mean Leah&rsquo;s had another vision. Time for church. You two coming?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You know me,&rdquo; Dean said with a ghost of his former spunk. &ldquo;Downright pious.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<hr /><p>The Prophet had seen demons about five miles out all gathered nice and neat in an abandoned farmhouse. This all stank of setup and stupidity but it wasn&rsquo;t like anyone was going to listen to the drunk old maid who&rsquo;d rambled into town a few days ago. The only thing of any real consequence occurred when Pastor Gideon began the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer. &ldquo;Our Father, who art in Heaven&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dean was right behind me. Under his breath he muttered, &ldquo;Yeah, not so much.&rdquo; When I turned around, puzzled, he shifted, but didn&rsquo;t acknowledge my silent query. </p>\n\n<p>The raid itself went without a hitch. People running about chanting their little chant and black smoke flying out of the windows like someone had let loose really ugly balloons. It was <em>afterwards</em> when it all went to shit. </p>\n\n<p>Most of us had already left, me included. Sam and Dean had lingered and so had Dylan, the son of some locals (Rob and Jean? Jane?). Not all the demons had hightailed it as soon as the guns started going off; one had decided to hang out underneath the Winchesters&rsquo; car. It pulled the young man underneath and slit his throat before the brothers could do shit. </p>\n\n<p>They came driving back, solemn as all hell, and quietly informed the others about Dylan&rsquo;s fate. His mother let out a terrible wail. I flinched, not at the mangled body in their back seat, but at that unearthly, devastating sound. I&rsquo;d seen a silent version under my grandparents&rsquo; lips at my parents&rsquo; wake. No one should live to bury their own child. </p>\n\n<p>Funerary services were hastily put together for that very evening. Sam, Dean, and I stood at the doorway of the church as it filled. We all felt as if going inside would be an unwelcome intrusion; after all, we were the only non-residents currently in town. A young man&rsquo;s death was too intimate a tragedy to barge in upon. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, Dylan&rsquo;s coffin passed by. His pallbearers, none of whom acknowledged our presence, appeared to be an uncle, grandfather, and several of his friends. Mother and father came stumbling up the steps shortly afterwards. I was staring at the grim wooden box when I heard Dean attempt to give his condolences. &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, we&rsquo;re just&hellip; very sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; the woman hissed through her tears, &ldquo;this is <em>your</em> fault.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Her husband said her name quietly in admonishment (Jane! That was it), but before they could go any further, I stepped in front of Dean and snapped, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame him for a damn <em>demon</em>. What, you think he personally stuck that thing under his car just to fuck over your son?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to listen to you,&rdquo; Jane snarled at me. &ldquo;Blasphemous, drunken <em>whore</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dean grabbed my arm and pulled me away before I could smack the bitch. Dylan&rsquo;s father took the opportunity to hustle Jane inside. </p>\n\n<p>As Pastor Gideon began the service, I jerked my limb out of Dean&rsquo;s grip. He frowned at me. &ldquo;She just lost her son,&rdquo; Dean scolded. &ldquo;Let her blame whoever she wants.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I threw my hands up and let them drop. This apathy of his was starting to grate on my nerves. &ldquo;The fuck is wrong with you?&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>Before he could retort there was a commotion inside the church. Sam gestured us over. On the floor was Leah, seizing, her father making blandishments until the fit passed. When it did, Pastor Gideon helped his daughter sit up. &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Dylan.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Just rest a minute, huh?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, listen! Dylan&rsquo;s coming back.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Leah Gideon, Prophet of the Lord, stood at the pulpit and promised paradise, including the inevitable reunion with lost loved ones&hellip; <em>if</em> we followed the angel&rsquo;s commandments. As I listened to her rattle off the list of demands my eyebrows crawled higher and higher. No gambling. No drinking. No premarital sex. In fact, no unmarried man or woman was allowed to be alone with the opposite gender without a church-sanctioned chaperone. Prayer morning, noon, and night. Curfew from nine to six. </p>\n\n<p>Dylan&rsquo;s parents, as well as a majority of the townsfolk, ate it up. Sam and I glanced at each other, astonished. I looked over and saw Paul staring at the girl in disbelief. Dean projected weary resignation. </p>\n\n<p>The brothers split up when the congregation finally dispersed. Dean went back inside to speak to whomever while Sam started walking towards the town&rsquo;s single motel. Paul had given me one of those sweet smiles of his as he&rsquo;d passed. Maybe we could start following the rules tomorrow instead&hellip;?</p>\n\n<p>I headed for the bar. It was nearly dark, but unlike every other night I&rsquo;d been in town no one else came in. Whatever. It wasn&rsquo;t curfew yet and Paul was a local. He flipped the neon &ldquo;open&rdquo; sign and settled behind the counter. I swung myself onto what I had privately claimed as &ldquo;my&rdquo; barstool and he plunked the usual down in front of me. </p>\n\n<p>A few minutes into my beer and Sam walked in. He greeted us both before sitting beside me. </p>\n\n<p>The boys bantered for a bit, Paul revealing the abrupt change in most of the town&rsquo;s attitudes once Leah had gone Prophet. He was the only person I knew that was outspoken about the obvious fraudulence underlying everyone&rsquo;s sudden piety. It&rsquo;s why I liked him best. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Not a true believer, I take it,&rdquo; Paul said to Sam. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe, yeah. I do.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just pretty sure God stopped caring a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>We scoffed at the indifference of our supposed creator. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Sam asked me. </p>\n\n<p>I was on my third beer and my guard had slipped a bit. &ldquo;Parents were devout. I believe that He&rsquo;s out there but I&rsquo;ll be damned if I give the son of a bitch the time of day.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink to that,&rdquo; Paul said. The three of us clinked mugs.</p>\n\n<p>We continued to drink until curfew. Paul and Sam talked about demons and television and sports while I munched on nuts and irregularly provided my opinions. It was a comfortable spot, cushioned by alcohol, and we drew a modicum of relief after the trials of the past twenty-four hours. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, shit wasn&rsquo;t done yet. I&rsquo;d been scrolling through news bits on my phone when my service abruptly died. &ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Sam. I showed him. He and Paul pulled out their own phones and, despite the varying carriers, found the same problem. &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Paul grumbled. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s &lsquo;curfew&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam groaned and staggered to his feet. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll see you two tomorrow then.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>We ribbed him for a bit about being a good little cultist before he left. Paul sighed and picked up Sam&rsquo;s empty mug. &ldquo;You going too?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo; I gave him a (drunken) smile. &ldquo;You want me to go?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He returned the expression, eyes dipping down to the skin I had peeking out from the V of my shirt and back up again. &ldquo;Not particularly.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>I reached over to grab his button-up and pulled him close. &ldquo;Then what do you say you lock up that door, close the lights, and we see what happens?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sounds good to me,&rdquo; he replied huskily. </p>\n\n<hr /><p>Sex with Paul was what I had come to expect from these small-town guys, but in his case the alliteration was in a good sense. See, when you live in a place where nearly everybody knows everybody most people end up having no more two or three sexual partners; the variety is lacking and the gossip is damning. These guys were, unfailingly so, inexperienced, with more clumsy enthusiasm than anything else. Wham, bam, thank you, ma&rsquo;am. </p>\n\n<p>Paul fell into that same, sorry category, but he had the exception of being gifted in both stamina and endowment. Good God, his was a dick to remember. He was sweet about the whole thing, too, getting all shy about putting on a condom and insisting on lapping at my folds until I was good and wet. I was the one who was pushing, eager to lose myself in the exertion, the alcohol not nearly enough to dull the effects of all the messed up shit that had gone down in the past eighteen hours. </p>\n\n<p>The man obliged, eventually, after he had slid himself deliciously inside of me. We were on the edge of one of the tables and I bit my lip as I gazed into his eyes, my hand gripping his shirt as my legs wrapped around his waist, before quietly requesting he get on with fucking me. Paul grinned, gave me a few experimentally harsh thrusts, before shunting that wonderful cock of his in and out of my cunt. </p>\n\n<p>We were just coming down, wrapped in post-coital bliss with his head resting between my breasts, when a rock came crashing through a window. I let out a shriek and he hurriedly drew away. Paul buttoned his pants back up as he went to investigate while I shoved my bra and shirt down and went looking for my jeans. I didn&rsquo;t find them before the door smashed in and a half dozen locals, spearheaded by Dylan&rsquo;s parents, marched in.</p>\n\n<p>My shirt was thankfully long enough to give me a shred of modesty, but it was obvious what we had been doing. Paul was still flushed and his buttons were askew while I was, well, pantsless. Jane&rsquo;s lip curled up at me. &ldquo;She was right!&rdquo; the woman cried. &ldquo;<em>You&rsquo;re</em> the reason why the angels are angry at us! Fornicators! Unbelievers! Blasphemers!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I could have sworn we were in Blue Earth, Colorado, and not Castle Rock, Maine. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re two consenting adults,&rdquo; I said as calmly as possible. &ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What matters is that you are keeping us from joining our son!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Okay, that made absolutely no sense, but when Pastor Gideon came rushing in things started to click into place. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Calm down. There&rsquo;s no reason to do this! Let&rsquo;s just talk it over.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The angels are angry, Pastor,&rdquo; said one of the other women. &ldquo;If we want to enter paradise we need to be rid of these people!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;They need to leave town <em>now</em>,&rdquo; Rob growled. &ldquo;Then we can tear apart this den of debauchery and lust.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>A chorus of agreement swept through the group. Bolstered by the support, Rob lifted the bat and smashed it down on the nearest set of liquor bottles. Seeing his livelihood threatened, Paul grabbed the weapon and began grappling with his old friend. Pastor Gideon did his best to physically come between them while shouting for peace. </p>\n\n<p>Jane and another local woman tried to corner me into the bar. I still hadn&rsquo;t found my pants, goddamnit! &ldquo;Touch me,&rdquo; I warned, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll break your face.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>My bravado was swept away by apprehension when I saw Jane reach into her jacket. There was no mistaking the black object hidden within as anything other than the handle of a semiautomatic. I was contemplating ways of disarming her when a new voice asked, &ldquo;Need some help, padre?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Fuck. Dean Winchester. I risked glancing over towards the doorway and saw the poster child for Prozac assessing the situation. My underdressed state made him blink but he was otherwise concerned by the rest. Pastor Gideon took advantage of the momentary lull in violence to plead, &ldquo;Just everybody cool down for a minute.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cool down,&rsquo; hmm?&rdquo; Paul repeated angrily. He turned towards Dean. &ldquo;My <em>friends</em> are trying to run me out of town. Do you think I should &lsquo;cool down&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I lost track of the ensuing conversation as I had, with great relief, <em>finally</em> caught sight of my missing jeans. I was inching towards them when I heard Paul say loudly, &ldquo;This is my <em>home</em>. You want me out of here? You&rsquo;ll have to drag me out.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I snatched up my pants and held them close to my chest. Maybe I&rsquo;d get ten seconds in all this chaos to shove them back on. </p>\n\n<p>Or not. I was sliding my way to Paul&rsquo;s side when Dean abruptly slugged Rob. The Pastor shouted, &ldquo;No no no&mdash; <em>stop</em> &mdash;&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>There were two loud reports. Something punched me in the stomach. </p>\n\n<p>Then nothing. </p>\n\n<hr /><p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> : Some lines of dialogue are taken directly from the episode &ldquo;99 Problems&rdquo; (SPN 5.17). </p></p>",
