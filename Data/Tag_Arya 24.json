He doesn\u2019t mention Arya\u2019s social status but i have the feeling like its implied. By saying this i feel like Lem is suggesting that the play fight has some sort of sexual/flirting undertones behind it.\u00a0</p><p>Now if you go back to Chapter 39 you could argue he\u2019s hinting to Gendry that joining the brotherhood won\u2019t improve his social class, he won\u2019t be able to kiss princesses or competing in competitions. He\u2019ll still be lowborn and nothing will change.\u00a0</p><p>Gendry is well aware of Arya\u2019s status and the divide that this makes, this is made clear in the books.\u00a0</p><p>In this scene (Chapter 34) Arya meets a young lord and they share a pleasant conversation, Gendry is clearly irritated by this.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Poor Ned seemed to grow more miserable with every mile. \u201cWhen I wear my helm, the rain beats against the steel and gives me headaches,\u201d he complained. \u201cBut when I take it off, my hair gets soaked and sticks to my face and in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a knife,\u201d Gendry suggested. \u201cIf your hair annoys you so much, shave your bloody head.\u201d</p><p><b>He doesn\u2019t like Ned.

She turned back to Ned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know who you were. My lord\u201d \u2026</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so. He loved my lady mother.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure he did, my lady, but -\u201d\u201cShe was the only one he loved.\u201d<b>\u201cHe must have found that bastard under a cabbage leaf, then,\u201d Gendry said behind them.</b>Arya wished she had another crabapple to bounce off his face. \u201cMy father had honor,\u201d she said angrily. \u201cAnd we weren\u2019t talking to you anyway.</p><p>Also in the peach scene(Chapter 29). They are in a brothel and they both get a little jealous.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'><i>An old man sat down beside her. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a pretty little peach?\u201d His breath smelled near as foul as the dead men in the cages, and his little pig eyes were crawling up and down her. \u201cDoes my sweet peach have a name?\u201d</i></p><p><i>For half a heartbeat she forgot who she was supposed to be. She wasn\u2019t any peach, but she couldn\u2019t be Arya Stark either, not here with some smelly drunk she did not know. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d Gendry put a heavy hand on the old man\u2019s shoulder, and squeezed. \u201cLeave her be.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The man turned, spoiling for a quarrel, but when he saw Gendry\u2019s size he thought better of it. \u201cYour sister, is she? What kind of brother are you? I\u2019d never bring no sister of mine to the Peach, that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He got up from the bench and moved off muttering, in search of a new friend.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d Arya hopped to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not my brother.\u201d<b>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cI\u2019m too bloody lowborn to be kin to m\u2019lady high.\u201d</b>Arya was taken aback by the fury in his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I meant it.\u201d\u201c<b>Yes it is.\u201d He sat down on the bench, cradling a cup of wine between his hands. \u201cGo away. I want to drink this wine in peace. Then maybe I\u2019ll go find that black-haired girl and ring her bell for her.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d<b>\u201cI said, go away. M\u2019lady.\u201d</b>Arya whirled and left him there. A stupid bullheaded bastard boy, that\u2019s all he is. He could ring all the bells he wanted, it was nothing to her.</i></p><p>So maybe Gendry did try to change his social status to get closer to Arya by joining the brotherhood without banners, when he noticed the divide between them, and Lem was reminding him being a lowborn knight wouldn\u2019t change anything. Sadly there is no Gendry POV so we can\u2019t tell.\u00a0</p><p>So does Lem\u2019s quote refer to Arya and Gendry\u2019s relationship? Yes. Am i grasping at straws? A little. However GRRM has an interesting way of writing and alot of the time he will leave breadcrumbs for us to follow, little hints that lead/hint to the bigger picture. I honestly do think it was a wink towards their relationship and some of Gendry\u2019s intentions behind joining.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed my TED Talk\u00a0</p>",

They are in a brothel and they both get a little jealous.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'><i>An old man sat down beside her. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a pretty little peach?\u201d His breath smelled near as foul as the dead men in the cages, and his little pig eyes were crawling up and down her. \u201cDoes my sweet peach have a name?\u201d</i></p><p><i>For half a heartbeat she forgot who she was supposed to be. She wasn\u2019t any peach, but she couldn\u2019t be Arya Stark either, not here with some smelly drunk she did not know. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d Gendry put a heavy hand on the old man\u2019s shoulder, and squeezed. \u201cLeave her be.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The man turned, spoiling for a quarrel, but when he saw Gendry\u2019s size he thought better of it. \u201cYour sister, is she? What kind of brother are you? I\u2019d never bring no sister of mine to the Peach, that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He got up from the bench and moved off muttering, in search of a new friend.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d Arya hopped to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not my brother.\u201d<b>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cI\u2019m too bloody lowborn to be kin to m\u2019lady high.\u201d</b>Arya was taken aback by the fury in his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I meant it.\u201d\u201c<b>Yes it is.\u201d He sat down on the bench, cradling a cup of wine between his hands. \u201cGo away. I want to drink this wine in peace. Then maybe I\u2019ll go find that black-haired girl and ring her bell for her.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d<b>\u201cI said, go away. M\u2019lady.\u201d</b>Arya whirled and left him there. A stupid bullheaded bastard boy, that\u2019s all he is. He could ring all the bells he wanted, it was nothing to her.</i></p><p>So maybe Gendry did try to change his social status to get closer to Arya by joining the brotherhood without banners, when he noticed the divide between them, and Lem was reminding him being a lowborn knight wouldn\u2019t change anything. Sadly there is no Gendry POV so we can\u2019t tell.\u00a0</p><p>So does Lem\u2019s quote refer to Arya and Gendry\u2019s relationship? Yes. Am i grasping at straws? A little. However GRRM has an interesting way of writing and alot of the time he will leave breadcrumbs for us to follow, little hints that lead/hint to the bigger picture. I honestly do think it was a wink towards their relationship and some of Gendry\u2019s intentions behind joining.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed my TED Talk\u00a0</p>",

I&rsquo;d never bring no sister of mine to the Peach, that I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He got up from the bench and moved off muttering, in search of a new friend.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why did you say that?&rdquo; Arya hopped to her feet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not my brother.&rdquo;<b>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too bloody lowborn to be kin to m&rsquo;lady high.&rdquo;</b>Arya was taken aback by the fury in his voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way I meant it.&rdquo;&ldquo;<b>Yes it is.&rdquo; He sat down on the bench, cradling a cup of wine between his hands. &ldquo;Go away. I want to drink this wine in peace. Then maybe I&rsquo;ll go find that black-haired girl and ring her bell for her.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;<b>&ldquo;I said, go away. M&rsquo;lady.&rdquo;</b>Arya whirled and left him there. A stupid bullheaded bastard boy, that&rsquo;s all he is. He could ring all the bells he wanted, it was nothing to her.</i></p><p>So maybe Gendry did try to change his social status to get closer to Arya by joining the brotherhood without banners, when he noticed the divide between them, and Lem was reminding him being a lowborn knight wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. Sadly there is no Gendry POV so we can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp;</p><p>So does Lem&rsquo;s quote refer to Arya and Gendry&rsquo;s relationship? Yes. Am i grasping at straws? A little. However GRRM has an interesting way of writing and alot of the time he will leave breadcrumbs for us to follow, little hints that lead/hint to the bigger picture. I honestly do think it was a wink towards their relationship and some of Gendry&rsquo;s intentions behind joining.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed my TED Talk&nbsp;</p>",
