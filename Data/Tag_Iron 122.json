Tony Stark in all his glory, masquerading as one &lsquo;Sebastian Vincent&rsquo; all for the sake of a diamond ring that he had a very keen eye on. Tony Stark was much more well known around the community as a thief and an excellent one at that. Even though he had been clocked by various armed forces and agencies, Anthony Stark had one thing going for him. The sheer ability to lie out of his ass. &ldquo;Jarvis, how we going buddy?&rdquo; The voice in his ear responded immediately. 'Going great, Sir, everyone seems to be unaware of your presence and as of who you are. The door to the vault is guarded, and there is a fingerprint assess to get into the vault itself. The case may be rigged.&rsquo; Tony nodded to himself and grabbed a flute of champagne, effortlessly blending into the crowd. Tony had an affinity for blending in with people, making easy chatter. He could read people far too easily. He was a spy gone rogue, and that was the only way he had gotten into the thievery business- and thus far not got taken in.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Tony, he had eyes on his back. It was the first time he hadn&rsquo;t spotted someone tailing him, and when he realised he would be rather upset he had missed the handsome man who had been staring at him. He took a sip from the flute of champagne, observing the crowd before setting the glass down, shedding his jacket and straightening his posture, sweeping one of the stainless steel serving plates from the table and passing one of the waiters, who didn&rsquo;t notice anything off or unfamiliar about him. Why would he when there were so many new staff members floating about for the main purpose of the event? Tony smiled to himself as he slipped into the back supply closet, closing the door behind him and clicking the lock. Tony hadn&rsquo;t come with any fancy tools, but he had learned how to improvise from what was seen as the best. His father. He had always thought it odd that Howard taught him all of these abstract methods of survival. Then after he had died he had learnt why at sixteen, when he was recruited into the agency his father had been in. He had lasted there a while before he turned to thievery. It was much more fun.</p><p>Tony had always been a brainbox for a kid. Always trying to impress his father, show him just what he could do even if his father made no plans to actually take care of what he was doing. With finishing MIT at the age of 15, it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise he would end up somewhere either on the good team or the bad team. But then again, Tony had his own side. The 'morally corrupt, but not too much because I steal from the rich guys&rsquo; side. He closed his eyes and took a breather. Now was no time to get all reminiscent. It was work time and time for that diamond ring to be in his possession. Tony liked fancy and extravagant pieces to show off to his company, the devious and the divine lot of them, and from his research, the ring was valued to be the second most expensive diamond in the world. Tony already had the first. A blue diamond to match his favourite car. How fitting.</p><p>Tony got to work, looking around the storage room. Of course, he could try and persuade the host to let him have a look at the ring before the auction started, but that ran far too great of a risk. Of course, for Tony, it would be all fun and games- but he wanted to do it the proper way this time. He needed to get the security guard away from the door where the vault was contained. Easy enough. Interfere with equipment. All he needed was a magnetic field and.. bingo. He grabbed a battery from inside one of the handheld mixers that was being stored in the room, along with one of the cake wire cutters. He loosened up the wire and ripped it from the frame, winding it around the battery and smiling at the familiar buzzing sound. He held it tight in one hand, picking up a tray and venturing out of the kitchen. He neared the door, giving two female guests a charming smile and offering them champagne, having to refrain from chuckling as he heard the quiet exclamation of 'shit&rsquo; from the guard at the door, who had just ripped his earpiece out, turning to storm to his boss, Tony was guessing. He winked at the girls and disappeared behind the door, still unaware of the eyes tracking his every move.</p><p>Tapping the side of his glasses, he gave Jarvis visuals on what he was seeing, glad for the AI he had developed, and the fact that technology was something he was highly gifted at. It made everything that little bit easier. Tony had already lifted a print, and from what Jarvis had gathered that was all he would need to get into the vault. He carried the tray past unsuspecting guards. He should have had to have an ID card to get in at the door, after all. He pushed his way into the room where the vault was located according to floor plans and stepped into a room that looked just like an ordinary lounging room, fitted with a fireplace and all. He knew better. Setting the tray down he looked around the room, eyes landing on the centrepiece of the room. A forgery of van Gogh. Tony had done better paintings than the forgery was himself as a child, and he had never very much been gifted in any of the arts. Anyone could imitate art. No promises of it being good, however.</p><p>He slowly pulled on the painting, rolling his eyes as it opened up on hinges. Typical. He walked through the doorway and up to the scanner and paused. Oh. Not a good sign, it was a full handprint scanner. Of course, he could go back to his original idea- and the easier idea, less risky- of persuading the seller to let him see the ring, but instead he went his own way. Now any good spy- and thief- knows if you scrape plaster from a wall and dust it onto the scanner, cover your hand with material and apply the slightest amount of pressure, you have about a 95% chance of tricking the scanner into thinking you were the last person to use it. As for the 5% chance of it failing- you just had to hope that permissions hadn&rsquo;t been taken away from the last person to use it, or you didn&rsquo;t slip and accidentally register your own fingerprints into a system. Tony let out a sigh of relief as the door clicked open, and there was a small box with silver clasps on it, just daring him to open it. So he did. No alarms went off, and the silence was almost deafening. The beating of his heard made up for the silence, though. The adrenaline rush he got from this was unparalleled. And Tony had jumped from buildings for funsies.</p><p>Picking the small pillow box up that contained the ring, he flipped the lid open to look at the blue diamond, and the alarms started blaring. &ldquo;Balls. Jarv, how many incoming.&rdquo; He tucked the box in his inside pocket, waiting on an answer from the AI as he hopped from the vault, picking up the serving tray and knocking the flutes from it with a crash. 12 gauge stainless steel. Enough to stop the standard issue guns he had seen the guards had on them. A guy with two guns rounded the corner. &ldquo;Listen up buttercup, I know you guys are paid to-&rdquo; He held the serving plate up as he ran across to the large couch, landing behind it and flattening himself. He took in a few gulps of air. &ldquo;protect this, but it really wasn&rsquo;t worth the pain.&rdquo; He sprung up, hurling the serving plate like a frisbee, wincing as it made contact with his neck, Tony watching him fall to the floor. He left the room and broke out into a jog.</p><p>Hopping over the bannister of the stairs he made a run for the front doors, hopping into a car that the valet had just pulled up, unaware to the figure in the back seat. He was smiling to himself as he put his foot down on the accelerator pedal. Knowing people would be quick on his tail, he pulled up at the marina, hopping into the first boat Jarvis could hack into. &ldquo;God bless technology.&rdquo; He twisted as he heard someone else get onto the boat, catching a glimpse of blonde hair before he was knocked unconscious.</p>",

Tony Stark in all his glory, masquerading as one &lsquo;Sebastian Vincent&rsquo; all for the sake of a diamond ring that he had a very keen eye on. Tony Stark was much more well known around the community as a thief and an excellent one at that. Even though he had been clocked by various armed forces and agencies, Anthony Stark had one thing going for him. The sheer ability to lie out of his ass. &ldquo;Jarvis, how we going buddy?&rdquo; The voice in his ear responded immediately. 'Going great, Sir, everyone seems to be unaware of your presence and as of who you are. The door to the vault is guarded, and there is a fingerprint assess to get into the vault itself. The case may be rigged.&rsquo; Tony nodded to himself and grabbed a flute of champagne, effortlessly blending into the crowd. Tony had an affinity for blending in with people, making easy chatter. He could read people far too easily. He was a spy gone rogue, and that was the only way he had gotten into the thievery business- and thus far not got taken in.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Tony, he had eyes on his back. It was the first time he hadn&rsquo;t spotted someone tailing him, and when he realised he would be rather upset he had missed the handsome man who had been staring at him. He took a sip from the flute of champagne, observing the crowd before setting the glass down, shedding his jacket and straightening his posture, sweeping one of the stainless steel serving plates from the table and passing one of the waiters, who didn&rsquo;t notice anything off or unfamiliar about him. Why would he when there were so many new staff members floating about for the main purpose of the event? Tony smiled to himself as he slipped into the back supply closet, closing the door behind him and clicking the lock. Tony hadn&rsquo;t come with any fancy tools, but he had learned how to improvise from what was seen as the best. His father. He had always thought it odd that Howard taught him all of these abstract methods of survival. Then after he had died he had learnt why at sixteen, when he was recruited into the agency his father had been in. He had lasted there a while before he turned to thievery. It was much more fun.</p><p>Tony had always been a brainbox for a kid. Always trying to impress his father, show him just what he could do even if his father made no plans to actually take care of what he was doing. With finishing MIT at the age of 15, it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise he would end up somewhere either on the good team or the bad team. But then again, Tony had his own side. The 'morally corrupt, but not too much because I steal from the rich guys&rsquo; side. He closed his eyes and took a breather. Now was no time to get all reminiscent. It was work time and time for that diamond ring to be in his possession. Tony liked fancy and extravagant pieces to show off to his company, the devious and the divine lot of them, and from his research, the ring was valued to be the second most expensive diamond in the world. Tony already had the first. A blue diamond to match his favourite car. How fitting.</p><p>Tony got to work, looking around the storage room. Of course, he could try and persuade the host to let him have a look at the ring before the auction started, but that ran far too great of a risk. Of course, for Tony, it would be all fun and games- but he wanted to do it the proper way this time. He needed to get the security guard away from the door where the vault was contained. Easy enough. Interfere with equipment. All he needed was a magnetic field and.. bingo. He grabbed a battery from inside one of the handheld mixers that was being stored in the room, along with one of the cake wire cutters. He loosened up the wire and ripped it from the frame, winding it around the battery and smiling at the familiar buzzing sound. He held it tight in one hand, picking up a tray and venturing out of the kitchen. He neared the door, giving two female guests a charming smile and offering them champagne, having to refrain from chuckling as he heard the quiet exclamation of 'shit&rsquo; from the guard at the door, who had just ripped his earpiece out, turning to storm to his boss, Tony was guessing. He winked at the girls and disappeared behind the door, still unaware of the eyes tracking his every move.</p><p>Tapping the side of his glasses, he gave Jarvis visuals on what he was seeing, glad for the AI he had developed, and the fact that technology was something he was highly gifted at. It made everything that little bit easier. Tony had already lifted a print, and from what Jarvis had gathered that was all he would need to get into the vault. He carried the tray past unsuspecting guards. He should have had to have an ID card to get in at the door, after all. He pushed his way into the room where the vault was located according to floor plans and stepped into a room that looked just like an ordinary lounging room, fitted with a fireplace and all. He knew better. Setting the tray down he looked around the room, eyes landing on the centrepiece of the room. A forgery of van Gogh. Tony had done better paintings than the forgery was himself as a child, and he had never very much been gifted in any of the arts. Anyone could imitate art. No promises of it being good, however.</p><p>He slowly pulled on the painting, rolling his eyes as it opened up on hinges. Typical. He walked through the doorway and up to the scanner and paused. Oh. Not a good sign, it was a full handprint scanner. Of course, he could go back to his original idea- and the easier idea, less risky- of persuading the seller to let him see the ring, but instead he went his own way. Now any good spy- and thief- knows if you scrape plaster from a wall and dust it onto the scanner, cover your hand with material and apply the slightest amount of pressure, you have about a 95% chance of tricking the scanner into thinking you were the last person to use it. As for the 5% chance of it failing- you just had to hope that permissions hadn&rsquo;t been taken away from the last person to use it, or you didn&rsquo;t slip and accidentally register your own fingerprints into a system. Tony let out a sigh of relief as the door clicked open, and there was a small box with silver clasps on it, just daring him to open it. So he did. No alarms went off, and the silence was almost deafening. The beating of his heard made up for the silence, though. The adrenaline rush he got from this was unparalleled. And Tony had jumped from buildings for funsies.</p><p>Picking the small pillow box up that contained the ring, he flipped the lid open to look at the blue diamond, and the alarms started blaring. &ldquo;Balls. Jarv, how many incoming.&rdquo; He tucked the box in his inside pocket, waiting on an answer from the AI as he hopped from the vault, picking up the serving tray and knocking the flutes from it with a crash. 12 gauge stainless steel. Enough to stop the standard issue guns he had seen the guards had on them. A guy with two guns rounded the corner. &ldquo;Listen up buttercup, I know you guys are paid to-&rdquo; He held the serving plate up as he ran across to the large couch, landing behind it and flattening himself.

He left the room and broke out into a jog.</p><p>Hopping over the bannister of the stairs he made a run for the front doors, hopping into a car that the valet had just pulled up, unaware to the figure in the back seat.

It wasn\u2019t for him- it was for you, his daughter. It was a thing that once every two months he\u2019d come in with you and talk with your therapist to see what was working, what wasn\u2019t, and what he could do to help. He took every ounce of advice with him back home and worked. He wanted to help you.</p><!-- more --><p>He\u2019d gotten you into therapy over a year ago, when he found out what was going on with you. You\u2019d gone on a school trip and he\u2019d decided to clean your room and change your bed for when you got back so you\u2019d have a nice fresh bed, but when doing so, he found a small box under the mattress\u2026 full of small blades, and lighters. He immediately knew what they were for, and when you came home, he was there with the box. He didn\u2019t yell, he didn\u2019t ask questions like \u201cWhy?\u201d. He simply said \u201cI love you, and I support you, would you like to get help?\u201d And thats what you did. </p><p>You\u2019d been doing better. You found it easier to talk to people, you didn\u2019t hide away and you were more open with you dad. Tony knew by now all your symptoms of hitting a particular rough patch. Messing with sleeves, being more reserved, staying in bed and loosing motivation. You became like a shell of yourself when you reached these points, and when they came, your dad never left your side. He\u2019d bring you food to bed, put your favourite movies on and take time off work to watch them with you, to assure you that you weren\u2019t alone and that he cared. He also moved your appointments to be closer so the therapist can help. </p><p>\u201cHey doc.\u201d He greeted the therapist who smiled back as you and your father got comfortable. You were sat beside your dad. You sat with your hands on your lap and your legs tucked under the chair, while Tony lounged with legs crossed. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to ask some basic questions, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d The therapist explained. Tony remained quiet, watching the doctor and you talk. Immediately he saw something. You were giving short answers to the questions. This wasn\u2019t normal. Usually you\u2019d go into more detail- tell the therapist the last time you felt low or something. But it was just yeses and no\u2019s. Something he wrong. </p><p>Then he saw the sleeves. Your sleeves, you were messing with them. Your inner arms were pressed together and tucked between your legs, like you were worried someone would see something despite the fact that you were wearing long sleeves and a jacket. His heart stopped. He averted his eyes, resting his arm on the arm of the chair and put his hand on his face, thinking on how to handle this. </p><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 Mr Stark, is there anything you want to talk about?\u201d The therapist asked. You glanced over to your father, and he shifted in his seat. </p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 yeah. Honey?\u201d He asked, offering his hand. You took it, and he squeezed your hand tightly. \u201cI just noticed you seem really self conscious right now\u2026 is everything okay?\u201d He asked softly. Your jaw tightened, and you looked him dead in the eye. \u201cDid you relapse?\u201d He asked. You very faintly nodded. He nodded back. He didn\u2019t yell. He didn\u2019t ask why. He just said \u201cOkay, thank you for telling me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen did you relapse?\u201d The therapist asked, taking over. You mumbled something. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t catch that Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stop.\u201d You spoke up. Tony\u2019s heart thudded again. He hated this. He felt like he\u2019d failed you. He\u2019d been trying to help you get better and it all seemed like it was for nothing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry dad.\u201d </p><p>Tony took a sharp breath in, squeezing your hand. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise baby. I should be the one apologising. I should have checked on you more, I should have noticed. We\u2019ll work through this, okay?\u201d He insisted. </p><p>\u201cSelf harm can become an addiction, but you telling us this means we can help you recover. We\u2019ll go through coping mechanisms and other things. Your dad can help as well. Don\u2019t feel ashamed about this, alright?\u201d Tony nodded along to the therapist, and you gently copied him, giving a small smile to your dad. Tony held your hand the rest of the session, and when you\u2019d left, mentioned a new ice cream parlour down the road, and said that you could order whatever you want but he won\u2019t be held accountable if Pepper get\u2019s on his ass if you get an upset tummy, which made you smile.</p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

It wasn\u2019t for him- it was for you, his daughter. It was a thing that once every two months he\u2019d come in with you and talk with your therapist to see what was working, what wasn\u2019t, and what he could do to help. He took every ounce of advice with him back home and worked. He wanted to help you.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He\u2019d gotten you into therapy over a year ago, when he found out what was going on with you. You\u2019d gone on a school trip and he\u2019d decided to clean your room and change your bed for when you got back so you\u2019d have a nice fresh bed, but when doing so, he found a small box under the mattress\u2026 full of small blades, and lighters. He immediately knew what they were for, and when you came home, he was there with the box. He didn\u2019t yell, he didn\u2019t ask questions like \u201cWhy?\u201d. He simply said \u201cI love you, and I support you, would you like to get help?\u201d And thats what you did. </p><p>You\u2019d been doing better. You found it easier to talk to people, you didn\u2019t hide away and you were more open with you dad. Tony knew by now all your symptoms of hitting a particular rough patch. Messing with sleeves, being more reserved, staying in bed and loosing motivation. You became like a shell of yourself when you reached these points, and when they came, your dad never left your side. He\u2019d bring you food to bed, put your favourite movies on and take time off work to watch them with you, to assure you that you weren\u2019t alone and that he cared. He also moved your appointments to be closer so the therapist can help. </p><p>\u201cHey doc.\u201d He greeted the therapist who smiled back as you and your father got comfortable. You were sat beside your dad. You sat with your hands on your lap and your legs tucked under the chair, while Tony lounged with legs crossed. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to ask some basic questions, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d The therapist explained. Tony remained quiet, watching the doctor and you talk. Immediately he saw something. You were giving short answers to the questions. This wasn\u2019t normal. Usually you\u2019d go into more detail- tell the therapist the last time you felt low or something. But it was just yeses and no\u2019s. Something he wrong. </p><p>Then he saw the sleeves. Your sleeves, you were messing with them. Your inner arms were pressed together and tucked between your legs, like you were worried someone would see something despite the fact that you were wearing long sleeves and a jacket. His heart stopped. He averted his eyes, resting his arm on the arm of the chair and put his hand on his face, thinking on how to handle this. </p><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 Mr Stark, is there anything you want to talk about?\u201d The therapist asked. You glanced over to your father, and he shifted in his seat. </p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 yeah. Honey?\u201d He asked, offering his hand. You took it, and he squeezed your hand tightly. \u201cI just noticed you seem really self conscious right now\u2026 is everything okay?\u201d He asked softly. Your jaw tightened, and you looked him dead in the eye. \u201cDid you relapse?\u201d He asked. You very faintly nodded. He nodded back. He didn\u2019t yell. He didn\u2019t ask why. He just said \u201cOkay, thank you for telling me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen did you relapse?\u201d The therapist asked, taking over. You mumbled something. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t catch that Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stop.\u201d You spoke up. Tony\u2019s heart thudded again. He hated this. He felt like he\u2019d failed you. He\u2019d been trying to help you get better and it all seemed like it was for nothing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry dad.\u201d </p><p>Tony took a sharp breath in, squeezing your hand. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise baby. I should be the one apologising. I should have checked on you more, I should have noticed. We\u2019ll work through this, okay?\u201d He insisted. </p><p>\u201cSelf harm can become an addiction, but you telling us this means we can help you recover. We\u2019ll go through coping mechanisms and other things. Your dad can help as well. Don\u2019t feel ashamed about this, alright?\u201d Tony nodded along to the therapist, and you gently copied him, giving a small smile to your dad. Tony held your hand the rest of the session, and when you\u2019d left, mentioned a new ice cream parlour down the road, and said that you could order whatever you want but he won\u2019t be held accountable if Pepper get\u2019s on his ass if you get an upset tummy, which made you smile.</p><hr><p>Hope you like it!
