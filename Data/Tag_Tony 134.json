Besides, if it weren\u2019t for this project, he probably would already have melted against Steve and let him carry him to bed for some lazy late night love making and a huge amount of cuddles afterwards. The simple thought of having the time for that without worrying anymore about an assemble alarm makes retiring definitely worth it.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m tired,\u201d Steve mumbles against Tony\u2019s neck, his hands circling around Tony\u2019s waist after he places his sketchbook on the table. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Tony shakes his head, rolling his eyes with fondness at his husband when he starts a trail of little kisses along his neck and jaw, igniting something warm and soft inside Tony, \u201cI can\u2019t, you big octopus. Gotta finish this blueprints for tomorrow. You know I have the presentation of the new StarkPhone in the evening, can\u2019t miss that or Pep will hang me.\u201d</p><p>Steve hums in annoyance, and tightens his embrace around Tony. \u201cSurely you can sneak away for a couple hours to cuddle with your husband, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re a menace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you married me.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Tony turns around and almost gives in when Steve pouts at him, making his heart clench in longing for a quiet and calm night with him. He cups Steve\u2019s jaw in his hands and kisses him softly, \u201cI wish I could honey, but this is really important. Why don\u2019t you go rest? I promise I\u2019ll join you as soon as I finish this, okay?\u201d</p><p>Steve kisses him again, pressing his lips on Tony\u2019s nose, his cheeks, his forehead, and smiles sweetly at him, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll stay up with you. Would you want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Tony grins at him, \u201cDo you even have to ask?\u201d</p><p>Steve leaves the workshop shortly after, his laughter still echoing in Tony&rsquo;s ears. There are some days when he wonders why Steve chose him. Out of everyone Steve could have had, he stayed with Tony. Even through endless fights and stress, he stays by Tony\u2019s side. It only makes Tony all the more aware of how resilient that man is. </p><p>He sighs and flexes his arms, willing the cramps away. He&rsquo;s been sitting here for hours, and he really would give anything to go to bed with Steve. But that&rsquo;ll have to wait.</p><p>He scraps the schematic he&rsquo;s working on, and when he goes to start a new one, he notices Steve&rsquo;s sketchbook out of the corner of his eye. He takes it between his hands, caressing the cover with something akin to awe. Steve is an artist, a truly talented one. He&rsquo;s not good at noticing his kind of stuff, Pepper says he just doesn&rsquo;t have a good eye for art - one of the many reasons why she used manage his art collection, which is actually hers in all honesty -, but even he realizes just how talented his husband is.</p><p>He opens the book, not worried about asking for permission since Steve gave him a permanent one a long time ago. He shuffles through the pages, tracing delicate lines and figures with his fingers across the pages. He comes across one that makes his hand freeze and his heart plummet to his stomach. It\u2019s nothing bad in particular, it&rsquo;s a great nude sketch of him, and it\u2019s also very recent by the looks of it. But the way his body is drawn\u2026</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t look like that anymore, not since he retired from active duty. The lines on his abdomen softened considerably, and his previously lean body disappeared to give some chubbiness space here and there. Nothing dangerous for his health, mind you. He&rsquo;s aware of his heart problems and doesn&rsquo;t need more factors besides the one he already has adding up to his heart problems. But yeah, he doesn&rsquo;t have the same body he had when he married Steve. </p><p>Steve, in turn, looks as perfect and fit and muscular and beefy as always. The epitome of human beauty and perfection. And the stark difference makes something bitter coil at the bottom of his stomach.</p><p>Tony would be lying if he says that the feeling sneaked up on him. He\u2019s been expecting them for months now. He knew that someday the guilt and self-deprecation would catch up on on him. But this burning jealousy towards Steve&rsquo;s ability to keep his health and fitness balanced? That makes him feel worse, makes him feel guilty. But honestly, he\u2019s Tony Stark; what else can he expect from himself other than the worst?</p><p>He decides to hide it all; the feelings, the insecurities, all locked up and kept in a neat box hidden in the depths of his heart. There\u2019s no use for those feelings, other than destroying his relationship with Steve.</p><p>And that\u2019s the least he wants.</p><p>So he makes a plan. He&rsquo;s gonna fix this. He\u2019s gonna fix himself, because Steve would never want him like this right? He\u2019s gonna fix himself, and Steve won\u2019t notice and won&rsquo;t leave him, and everything will be okay. He\u2019s a mechanic after all. Building and fixing stuff is what he does. He\u2019s gonna fix himself, just like he did when he realized his father never loved him and never would, just like he did when i was in Afghanistan, and just like he will do to save their marriage. </p><p>Obviously, Steve notices something\u2019s going on in less than a week. </p><p>Tony knows that Steve is far more perceptive than most people give him credit for, and for the first time in his life he&rsquo;s not sure he&rsquo;s happy about it. He knows Tony almost too well, so it\u2019s not surprise for Tony when he looks up from the blue prints he\u2019s working on to take a drink from his awful and bitter green smoothie to find his husband standing in front of him with his eyebrows pinched and concern shining brightly in his eyes.</p><p>Tony looks up at him, internally groaning, and braces himself for the \u2018We Have To Talk\u2019 conversation opener. This is it, Tony thinks, he\u2019s knows, and he&rsquo;s finally gotten tired of me. So he puts on his \u2018Everything\u2019s Peachy\u2019 face and grins up at his husband.</p><p>\u201cMy sweet honeybee, how are you?\u201d he says to Steve, who sighs deeply at the endearment and the obvious anxiety seeping into Tony&rsquo;s words.</p><p>Steve raises an unimpressed eyebrow at him, crossing his arms over his broad chest, and says \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be asking you that?\u201d</p><p>Tony raises his eyebrows and takes a long sip from the smoothie, trying not to grimace at the taste or, you know, do that thing that Steve says he does when he tastes something disgusting. \u201cI\u2019m peachy, darling. Nothing wrong here. You, on the other hand, look like someone kicked your puppy and you&rsquo;re both sad and angry about it. What&rsquo;s up? The trainees are giving you a hard time again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, we\u2019ve been married for two years, and we\u2019ve been dating even longer, I know you, and I know that there\u2019s something going on-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d Tony interrupts him abruptly, his question coming out harsh, and he grimaces. Yeah, he&rsquo;s decidedly not good at this, and probably will never be.</p><p>Steve uncrosses his arms and sighs again, his body relaxing and tensing at the same time, which makes something twisted uncurl at the bottom of Tony&rsquo;s stomach. That stance doesn\u2019t look good on him, and he tries to resist the urge to offer him a massage to ease the tension - we already established that Tony likes to torture himself, right? - because he knows it probably wouldn\u2019t be well received, due to the fact that it&rsquo;s an obvious and great way to escape the upcoming serious conversation. </p><p>Steve walks over and sits on the couch, crossing one leg ever the other and looking at anything but Tony. Tony\u2019s breath hitches when Steve\u2019s eyes focus on his sketchbook, open from where Tony left it on the small table just beside Steve\u2019s watercolors a couple days ago. Steve stares at it as if it hold all the answers he needs, and the irony is that it does. It\u2019s the sketchbook that started all of this. The sketchbook with the sketch that lit up Tony\u2019s hidden awareness of his own insecurities.</p><p>He takes it, his eyes analyzing the drawing and something in Tony\u2019s chest tightens. Well then, this is probably it. He will look up at Tony and see his face and will know what\u2019s going on, and everything he\u2019s tried in the last few days will be in vain. The thought alone makes him want to throw up the smoothie.</p><p>Steve looks up at him, and just like Tony thought, he notices. Tony can feel the ground shake under his feet, as if a carpet were pulled from under where he\u2019s standing, when he sees the realization dawning on Steve\u2019s bright blue eyes. The terrible urge to escape from there floods his chest and mind, at the same time as he sees his mind and vision become cloudy, and oh God, is he crying? Oh god, oh no, this is too much, and his mind screams at him to get out.</p><p>A pair of arms surround him, wrapping him in a hug. Tony opens his eyes, not even aware that he had closed them, and when he looks up, he finds the worried look of his husband as he holds him in his arms, his tight and secure grip makes something in Tony ease and calm down a little.</p><p>After a while, he feels it more than he hears Steve when he asks, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony says, and he chokes on the word, but Steve is holding him and that\u2019s okay. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Steve asks, and Tony finds himself nodding silently. Steve lets go of his hands and walks over to the workbench, grabbing the sketchbook.</p><p>\u201cLook further,\u201d he says, lying it in Tony\u2019s hands. </p><p>Tony glances up at him and gives him a questioning look. He flips past the page he\u2019d stopped at, and the drawings take his breath away. It\u2019s Tony, again, amongst other things, but he looks like him now, the way he does now, and yet&hellip;there\u2019s nothing exactly different about it.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re you,\u201d Steve says simply, and normally, Tony might tease him, but it\u2019s true, they are him. His growing stomach is there, along with his less muscular arms and legs, and yet, nothing\u2019s different. The care, the love in each pencil mark is still there, just a slightly different figure. </p><p>With that, Tony feels the last of his anxiety melt away. How could it not? The drawings make it obvious, the way Steve loves him. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Tony says, looking up. \u201cI could\u2019ve just saved us both a lot of trouble if I\u2019d have looked further.\u201d</p><p>Steve gives him a soft smile and moves so that Tony\u2019s sitting in his lap. \u201cNah,\u201d Steve says, \u201c\u2018s okay. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony mumbles, his throat suddenly tight with emotion, Steve\u2019s arm around him. \u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Tony,\u201d Steve says, holding Tony like he\u2019s the most precious thing in the world, \u201cYou&rsquo;re always going to be perfect to me.\u201d </p><p>And as he looks into Steve\u2019s eyes, Tony realizes, for the first time, that he completely, full-heartedly believes him. </p><p>It\u2019s the best feeling in the world. </p>",

The sketchbook with the sketch that lit up Tony\u2019s hidden awareness of his own insecurities.</p><p>He takes it, his eyes analyzing the drawing and something in Tony\u2019s chest tightens. Well then, this is probably it. He will look up at Tony and see his face and will know what\u2019s going on, and everything he\u2019s tried in the last few days will be in vain. The thought alone makes him want to throw up the smoothie.</p><p>Steve looks up at him, and just like Tony thought, he notices. Tony can feel the ground shake under his feet, as if a carpet were pulled from under where he\u2019s standing, when he sees the realization dawning on Steve\u2019s bright blue eyes. The terrible urge to escape from there floods his chest and mind, at the same time as he sees his mind and vision become cloudy, and oh God, is he crying? Oh god, oh no, this is too much, and his mind screams at him to get out.</p><p>A pair of arms surround him, wrapping him in a hug. Tony opens his eyes, not even aware that he had closed them, and when he looks up, he finds the worried look of his husband as he holds him in his arms, his tight and secure grip makes something in Tony ease and calm down a little.</p><p>After a while, he feels it more than he hears Steve when he asks, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony says, and he chokes on the word, but Steve is holding him and that\u2019s okay. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Steve asks, and Tony finds himself nodding silently. Steve lets go of his hands and walks over to the workbench, grabbing the sketchbook.</p><p>\u201cLook further,\u201d he says, lying it in Tony\u2019s hands. </p><p>Tony glances up at him and gives him a questioning look. He flips past the page he\u2019d stopped at, and the drawings take his breath away. It\u2019s Tony, again, amongst other things, but he looks like him now, the way he does now, and yet\u2026there\u2019s nothing exactly different about it.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re you,\u201d Steve says simply, and normally, Tony might tease him, but it\u2019s true, they are him. His growing stomach is there, along with his less muscular arms and legs, and yet, nothing\u2019s different. The care, the love in each pencil mark is still there, just a slightly different figure. </p><p>With that, Tony feels the last of his anxiety melt away. How could it not? The drawings make it obvious, the way Steve loves him. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Tony says, looking up. \u201cI could\u2019ve just saved us both a lot of trouble if I\u2019d have looked further.\u201d</p><p>Steve gives him a soft smile and moves so that Tony\u2019s sitting in his lap. \u201cNah,\u201d Steve says, \u201c\u2018s okay. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony mumbles, his throat suddenly tight with emotion, Steve\u2019s arm around him. \u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Tony,\u201d Steve says, holding Tony like he\u2019s the most precious thing in the world, \u201cYou\u2019re always going to be perfect to me.\u201d </p><p>And as he looks into Steve\u2019s eyes, Tony realizes, for the first time, that he completely, full-heartedly believes him. </p><p>It\u2019s the best feeling in the world. </p>",

Still holding his sketchbook in his hand, he walks forward and around the worktable to drape himself all over Tony\u2019s back like an octopus.</p><p>Tony would say he hates it, but it would be a lie, since the warm presence and pressure of his husband on his back eases some of his stress, and he absolutely loves his clingy husband. Besides, if it weren\u2019t for this project, he probably would already have melted against Steve and let him carry him to bed for some lazy late night love making and a huge amount of cuddles afterwards. The simple thought of having the time for that without worrying anymore about an assemble alarm makes retiring definitely worth it.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m tired,\u201d Steve mumbles against Tony\u2019s neck, his hands circling around Tony\u2019s waist after he places his sketchbook on the table. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Tony shakes his head, rolling his eyes with fondness at his husband when he starts a trail of little kisses along his neck and jaw, igniting something warm and soft inside Tony, \u201cI can\u2019t, you big octopus. Gotta finish this blueprints for tomorrow. You know I have the presentation of the new StarkPhone in the evening, can\u2019t miss that or Pep will hang me.\u201d</p><p>Steve hums in annoyance, and tightens his embrace around Tony. \u201cSurely you can sneak away for a couple hours to cuddle with your husband, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you married me.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony turns around and almost gives in when Steve pouts at him, making his heart clench in longing for a quiet and calm night with him. He cups Steve\u2019s jaw in his hands and kisses him softly, \u201cI wish I could honey, but this is really important. Why don\u2019t you go rest? I promise I\u2019ll join you as soon as I finish this, okay?\u201d</p><p>Steve kisses him again, pressing his lips on Tony\u2019s nose, his cheeks, his forehead, and smiles sweetly at him, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll stay up with you. Would you want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Tony grins at him, \u201cDo you even have to ask?\u201d</p><p>Steve leaves the workshop shortly after, his laughter still echoing in Tony\u2019s ears. There are some days when he wonders why Steve chose him. Out of everyone Steve could have had, he stayed with Tony. Even through endless fights and stress, he stays by Tony\u2019s side. It only makes Tony all the more aware of how resilient that man is. </p><p>He sighs and flexes his arms, willing the cramps away. He\u2019s been sitting here for hours, and he really would give anything to go to bed with Steve. But that\u2019ll have to wait.</p><p>He scraps the schematic he\u2019s working on, and when he goes to start a new one, he notices Steve\u2019s sketchbook out of the corner of his eye. He takes it between his hands, caressing the cover with something akin to awe. Steve is an artist, a truly talented one. He\u2019s not good at noticing his kind of stuff, Pepper says he just doesn\u2019t have a good eye for art - one of the many reasons why she used manage his art collection, which is actually hers in all honesty -, but even he realizes just how talented his husband is.</p><p>He opens the book, not worried about asking for permission since Steve gave him a permanent one a long time ago. He shuffles through the pages, tracing delicate lines and figures with his fingers across the pages. He comes across one that makes his hand freeze and his heart plummet to his stomach. It\u2019s nothing bad in particular, it\u2019s a great nude sketch of him, and it\u2019s also very recent by the looks of it. But the way his body is drawn\u2026</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look like that anymore, not since he retired from active duty. The lines on his abdomen softened considerably, and his previously lean body disappeared to give some chubbiness space here and there. Nothing dangerous for his health, mind you. He\u2019s aware of his heart problems and doesn\u2019t need more factors besides the one he already has adding up to his heart problems. But yeah, he doesn\u2019t have the same body he had when he married Steve. </p><p>Steve, in turn, looks as perfect and fit and muscular and beefy as always. The epitome of human beauty and perfection. And the stark difference makes something bitter coil at the bottom of his stomach.</p><p>Tony would be lying if he says that the feeling sneaked up on him. He\u2019s been expecting them for months now. He knew that someday the guilt and self-deprecation would catch up on on him. But this burning jealousy towards Steve\u2019s ability to keep his health and fitness balanced? That makes him feel worse, makes him feel guilty. But honestly, he\u2019s Tony Stark; what else can he expect from himself other than the worst?</p><p>He decides to hide it all; the feelings, the insecurities, all locked up and kept in a neat box hidden in the depths of his heart. There\u2019s no use for those feelings, other than destroying his relationship with Steve.</p><p>And that\u2019s the least he wants.</p><p>So he makes a plan. He\u2019s gonna fix this. He\u2019s gonna fix himself, because Steve would never want him like this right? He\u2019s gonna fix himself, and Steve won\u2019t notice and won\u2019t leave him, and everything will be okay. He\u2019s a mechanic after all. Building and fixing stuff is what he does. He\u2019s gonna fix himself, just like he did when he realized his father never loved him and never would, just like he did when i was in Afghanistan, and just like he will do to save their marriage. </p><p>Obviously, Steve notices something\u2019s going on in less than a week. </p><p>Tony knows that Steve is far more perceptive than most people give him credit for, and for the first time in his life he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s happy about it. He knows Tony almost too well, so it\u2019s not surprise for Tony when he looks up from the blue prints he\u2019s working on to take a drink from his awful and bitter green smoothie to find his husband standing in front of him with his eyebrows pinched and concern shining brightly in his eyes.</p><p>Tony looks up at him, internally groaning, and braces himself for the \u2018We Have To Talk\u2019 conversation opener. This is it, Tony thinks, he\u2019s knows, and he\u2019s finally gotten tired of me. So he puts on his \u2018Everything\u2019s Peachy\u2019 face and grins up at his husband.</p><p>\u201cMy sweet honeybee, how are you?\u201d he says to Steve, who sighs deeply at the endearment and the obvious anxiety seeping into Tony\u2019s words.</p><p>Steve raises an unimpressed eyebrow at him, crossing his arms over his broad chest, and says \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be asking you that?\u201d</p><p>Tony raises his eyebrows and takes a long sip from the smoothie, trying not to grimace at the taste or, you know, do that thing that Steve says he does when he tastes something disgusting. \u201cI\u2019m peachy, darling. Nothing wrong here. You, on the other hand, look like someone kicked your puppy and you\u2019re both sad and angry about it. What\u2019s up? The trainees are giving you a hard time again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, we\u2019ve been married for two years, and we\u2019ve been dating even longer, I know you, and I know that there\u2019s something going on-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d Tony interrupts him abruptly, his question coming out harsh, and he grimaces. Yeah, he\u2019s decidedly not good at this, and probably will never be.</p><p>Steve uncrosses his arms and sighs again, his body relaxing and tensing at the same time, which makes something twisted uncurl at the bottom of Tony\u2019s stomach. That stance doesn\u2019t look good on him, and he tries to resist the urge to offer him a massage to ease the tension - we already established that Tony likes to torture himself, right? - because he knows it probably wouldn\u2019t be well received, due to the fact that it\u2019s an obvious and great way to escape the upcoming serious conversation. </p><p>Steve walks over and sits on the couch, crossing one leg ever the other and looking at anything but Tony. Tony\u2019s breath hitches when Steve\u2019s eyes focus on his sketchbook, open from where Tony left it on the small table just beside Steve\u2019s watercolors a couple days ago.

Steve lets go of his hands and walks over to the workbench, grabbing the sketchbook.</p><p>\u201cLook further,\u201d he says, lying it in Tony\u2019s hands. </p><p>Tony glances up at him and gives him a questioning look.

The trainees are giving you a hard time again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, we&rsquo;ve been married for two years, and we&rsquo;ve been dating even longer, I know you, and I know that there&rsquo;s something going on-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What gave it away?&rdquo; Tony interrupts him abruptly, his question coming out harsh, and he grimaces. Yeah, he&rsquo;s decidedly not good at this, and probably will never be.</p><p>Steve uncrosses his arms and sighs again, his body relaxing and tensing at the same time, which makes something twisted uncurl at the bottom of Tony&rsquo;s stomach. That stance doesn&rsquo;t look good on him, and he tries to resist the urge to offer him a massage to ease the tension - we already established that Tony likes to torture himself, right? - because he knows it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be well received, due to the fact that it&rsquo;s an obvious and great way to escape the upcoming serious conversation. </p><p>Steve walks over and sits on the couch, crossing one leg ever the other and looking at anything but Tony. Tony&rsquo;s breath hitches when Steve&rsquo;s eyes focus on his sketchbook, open from where Tony left it on the small table just beside Steve&rsquo;s watercolors a couple days ago. Steve stares at it as if it hold all the answers he needs, and the irony is that it does. It&rsquo;s the sketchbook that started all of this. The sketchbook with the sketch that lit up Tony&rsquo;s hidden awareness of his own insecurities.</p><p>He takes it, his eyes analyzing the drawing and something in Tony&rsquo;s chest tightens. Well then, this is probably it. He will look up at Tony and see his face and will know what&rsquo;s going on, and everything he&rsquo;s tried in the last few days will be in vain. The thought alone makes him want to throw up the smoothie.</p><p>Steve looks up at him, and just like Tony thought, he notices. Tony can feel the ground shake under his feet, as if a carpet were pulled from under where he&rsquo;s standing, when he sees the realization dawning on Steve&rsquo;s bright blue eyes. The terrible urge to escape from there floods his chest and mind, at the same time as he sees his mind and vision become cloudy, and oh God, is he crying? Oh god, oh no, this is too much, and his mind screams at him to get out.</p><p>A pair of arms surround him, wrapping him in a hug. Tony opens his eyes, not even aware that he had closed them, and when he looks up, he finds the worried look of his husband as he holds him in his arms, his tight and secure grip makes something in Tony ease and calm down a little.</p><p>After a while, he feels it more than he hears Steve when he asks, &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony says, and he chokes on the word, but Steve is holding him and that&rsquo;s okay. &ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I show you something?&rdquo; Steve asks, and Tony finds himself nodding silently. Steve lets go of his hands and walks over to the workbench, grabbing the sketchbook.</p><p>&ldquo;Look further,&rdquo; he says, lying it in Tony&rsquo;s hands. </p><p>Tony glances up at him and gives him a questioning look. He flips past the page he&rsquo;d stopped at, and the drawings take his breath away. It&rsquo;s Tony, again, amongst other things, but he looks like him now, the way he does now, and yet&hellip;there&rsquo;s nothing exactly different about it.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re you,&rdquo; Steve says simply, and normally, Tony might tease him, but it&rsquo;s true, they are him. His growing stomach is there, along with his less muscular arms and legs, and yet, nothing&rsquo;s different. The care, the love in each pencil mark is still there, just a slightly different figure. </p><p>With that, Tony feels the last of his anxiety melt away. How could it not? The drawings make it obvious, the way Steve loves him. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Tony says, looking up. &ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve just saved us both a lot of trouble if I&rsquo;d have looked further.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve gives him a soft smile and moves so that Tony&rsquo;s sitting in his lap. &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Steve says, &ldquo;&lsquo;s okay. I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Tony mumbles, his throat suddenly tight with emotion, Steve&rsquo;s arm around him. &ldquo;Love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Tony,&rdquo; Steve says, holding Tony like he&rsquo;s the most precious thing in the world, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always going to be perfect to me.&rdquo; </p><p>And as he looks into Steve&rsquo;s eyes, Tony realizes, for the first time, that he completely, full-heartedly believes him. </p><p>It&rsquo;s the best feeling in the world. </p>",

Besides, if it weren&rsquo;t for this project, he probably would already have melted against Steve and let him carry him to bed for some lazy late night love making and a huge amount of cuddles afterwards. The simple thought of having the time for that without worrying anymore about an assemble alarm makes retiring definitely worth it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m tired,&rdquo; Steve mumbles against Tony&rsquo;s neck, his hands circling around Tony&rsquo;s waist after he places his sketchbook on the table. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go to bed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony shakes his head, rolling his eyes with fondness at his husband when he starts a trail of little kisses along his neck and jaw, igniting something warm and soft inside Tony, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, you big octopus. Gotta finish this blueprints for tomorrow. You know I have the presentation of the new StarkPhone in the evening, can&rsquo;t miss that or Pep will hang me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Steve hums in annoyance, and tightens his embrace around Tony. &ldquo;Surely you can sneak away for a couple hours to cuddle with your husband, right?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a menace.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yet you married me.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

You were always so focused on finding Steve Rogers or keeping your business going. You never had time for him, and when you did, it was just to berate him for not being good enough or to place the blame on him during a drunken rage.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She hadn\u2019t meant to say so much.

Just not by you. It\u2019ll be after you go, and completely by accident because once you\u2019re gone, the world gives up on Captain America. You don\u2019t get to see him again, and you waste your life chasing after your dead friend instead of focusing on your very much living, vulnerable young son for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was silent for a bit, until (Y/N) could no longer stand Howard\u2019s stunned expression.

It looked a lot shabbier than the one from the alternate timeline that Not (Y/N)\u2019s Tony had built, but it would do the job. As much as she was hoping to avoid it, Howard pulled her aside a few hours before she and Tony were set to go back home.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not comforting, Howard,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ve probably changed things by telling you all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Howard shook his head. \u201cIf you tell me the rest of what happens, I can make sure things stay on course.

Her powers of perception were slightly dampened here, but she tried her best to tap into them. There was a moment where her eyes flashed gold, then\u2026</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOkay. But swear to me that no matter what I tell you, you <i>will</i> hold to it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The man nodded solemnly. \u201cAnything. He\u2019s\u2026 He\u2019s happy with you.

(Y/N) watched him sadly.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTony, don\u2019t you want to say goodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTony\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked at her, almost pleading. \u201c(Y/N)&hellip; I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She ran a hand through her hair. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just then, Howard approached them.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was trying to be cheerful, but what (Y/N) had told him concerning how he met his death - and at whose hands he would meet it - was obviously getting to him. By the frown on Tony\u2019s face, even he could tell, but he said nothing.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d (Y/N) said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re ready\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Howard nodded and flipped the switch. This portal was much more controlled than what had essentially been a black hole that HYDRA had created. This was simply a swirl of gold sparks that circled a doorway of inky blackness.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tony looked at Howard, seemingly debating something.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGoodbye, dad\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Howard gave him the faintest of smiles. \u201cGoodbye, son.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With that, Tony took (Y/N)\u2019s hand, and they stepped into the portal together.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Almost immediately, the two of them were thrown against the hard ground outside of the HYDRA complex. Everything was deathly still until Pietro appeared beside them.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat was that explosion? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tony and (Y/N) blinked and looked around. They were back.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a long story\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that story would have to wait. Just then, a sleek, black jet landed a short distance away.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Y/N) looked over towards the quinjet where the other Avengers were immediately on alert, but with a jolt, she realized she knew that jet. With an even greater shock, she realized that she could feel the connection that had been dormant for so long.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPapa?\u201d she whispered, staggering to her feet, still disoriented. As quickly as she could, she shook off her confusion and rushed towards the jet.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ramp descended, and it was as if all the air had been knocked from her lungs. Her father was there, and so was Hank. The two of them stared at her, and she stared back.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Professor X\u2019s face slowly morphed into the expression of a man who has just found the final piece to a mystery.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat psychic disturbance\u2026 The rupture\u2026 That was a time portal, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Holding back tears, (Y/N) nodded. \u201cYes Papa\u2026 I\u2019m back\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She glanced back at the confused Avengers and laughed softly. \u201cAnd I think we have a lot of catching up to do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her father smiled gently. \u201cIndeed we do\u2026\u201d</p><hr><p>A/N: Would you all be happy with this as the end, or should I do an epilogue?</p><hr><p>Permanent Tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3qrkhAh8oMflj84Q8mL0gw\">@coconutknees</a><br/></p><p>Series Tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m76mRZjFU5Yp4Yk46kf_BFA\">@thevanishedillusion</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnSLnMAWxQSqkUUZXBDRqiw\">@vverecat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7pIoq9mwqyWzZFyZpYiOUQ\">@darthskywalker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_zF9x1b0KgjArH0l7XNcPA\">@superwholockian5ever</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4focKRMwc5-jU--sh73hpQ\">@multifandom-slytherin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCFPw6YwBe-XVL1qNsIVtDA\">@klanceiscannon14</a>\u00a0</p><hr><p>Edit: There is an epilogue!

He won&rsquo;t so much as look at me, nevermind talking to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way he fiddled with the wrench as he spoke reminded her so very much of Tony.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Howard&hellip; He&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man watched her expectantly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You were never really a father to him, Howard. You were always so focused on finding Steve Rogers or keeping your business going. You never had time for him, and when you did, it was just to berate him for not being good enough or to place the blame on him during a drunken rage.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hadn&rsquo;t meant to say so much. It was risky, telling him all of this, but the more she spoke, the angrier she got.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So if he hates you, it&rsquo;s safe to say that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s your own fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard gaped at her, trying to process it all, but that dumbfounded expression only drove her further in spite.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, and just so you know, Steve will get found. Just not by you. It&rsquo;ll be after you go, and completely by accident because once you&rsquo;re gone, the world gives up on Captain America. You don&rsquo;t get to see him again, and you waste your life chasing after your dead friend instead of focusing on your very much living, vulnerable young son for nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was silent for a bit, until (Y/N) could no longer stand Howard&rsquo;s stunned expression. Quickly, she stood and walked away. What had she just done?</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine was ready just a few days later. It looked a lot shabbier than the one from the alternate timeline that Not (Y/N)&rsquo;s Tony had built, but it would do the job. As much as she was hoping to avoid it, Howard pulled her aside a few hours before she and Tony were set to go back home.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what you said.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not comforting, Howard,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve probably changed things by telling you all of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard shook his head. &ldquo;If you tell me the rest of what happens, I can make sure things stay on course. Minus neglecting my son.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Y/N) considered him carefully. Her powers of perception were slightly dampened here, but she tried her best to tap into them. There was a moment where her eyes flashed gold, then&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. But swear to me that no matter what I tell you, you <i>will</i> hold to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man nodded solemnly. &ldquo;Anything. He&rsquo;s&hellip; He&rsquo;s happy with you. I could never take that away from him.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed. &ldquo;Okay&hellip; get a pen and paper.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony was still ignoring Howard as he got ready to turn the machine on. (Y/N) watched him sadly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony, don&rsquo;t you want to say goodbye?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her, almost pleading. &ldquo;(Y/N)&hellip; I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran a hand through her hair. &ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Howard approached them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was trying to be cheerful, but what (Y/N) had told him concerning how he met his death - and at whose hands he would meet it - was obviously getting to him. By the frown on Tony&rsquo;s face, even he could tell, but he said nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; (Y/N) said softly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard nodded and flipped the switch.

Bruce had been stringent. Don\u2019t let it go any further. Natasha hadn\u2019t, and she must have had her reasons. But he needed a track to give chase to, and Kosvinsky hadn\u2019t provided anything but dead ends where Bucky was concerned. Dead ends and corpses.</p>",
