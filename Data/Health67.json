Cold coconut oil could provide the illusion of desserts also if there isn&rsquo;t sugar in it.</p><p>I initially discovered this when refrigerating sausage pieces cooked in coconut oil. When cold, the previously-cooked oil takes an &ldquo;topping&rdquo; like taste and appearance on whatever food you&rsquo;re making use of. This is certainly an area to experiment with.

Been an athlete for a while, and have been training the overhead press itself since about 2007. I remember reading Pavel Tastousline say that pressing your bodyweight overhead was a sign of getting strong, and that initially became the goal.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve been chasing this goal for 3 years, ever since Kalle Beck threw it down in Starting Strongman. At the time, I could manage 7 reps, and I assumed it was right around the corner. However, I got big into competing in strongman, so my strict press got deprioritized and then I blew out my ACL, so training got a little different. </p> <p><strong>TRAINING</strong></p> <p>I have been SO close to this number for a long time. What seemed to finally break me through was 18 weeks of running the Deep Water program (which I&rsquo;ve reviewed in detail here on <a href=\"/r/fitness\" target=\"_blank\">r/fitness</a>. You can find the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9ry1st/review_of_jon_andersens_deep_water_beginner/\" target=\"_blank\">Beginner program here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/a6aumc/program_review_jon_andersens_deep_water/\" target=\"_blank\">intermediate program here</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/ak7he7/program_review_deep_water_advanced_program/\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced program here</a> )</p> <p>Prior to running Deep Water, and then post Deep Water, my press training was based around 5/3/1. I&rsquo;d work up to a topset and do a PR set there, and then I&rsquo;d do a FSL PR set after that, to get in more volume. For this particular training cycle, I&rsquo;ve been doing a Second Set Last (SSL) PR set, rather than a FSL set, just to get training with slightly heavier weight. I do my best to try to make the reps match on the topset PR set and the SSL set.</p> <p>Between those sets, I&rsquo;ll superset with a set of 20 band pull aparts. After the heavy pressing, I&rsquo;ll run a giant set of more strict pressing followed by dips followed by lateral raises. Really just trying to get in a lot of volume and fatigue in a short amount of time.</p> <p>The only other pressing I&rsquo;ll train during the week is bench, which these days I&rsquo;m using the same benching program that was in Deep Water. It&rsquo;s 3 sets of flat bench, 3 sets of close grip, 3 sets of incline, then 3 sets of dips. Hits things from all sorts of angles.</p> <p><strong>LESSONS LEARNED AND PASS ALONGS</strong></p> <p>I see a lot of folks struggling with pressing, and after hitting my head against the wall for a few years before coming out of nowhere and smashing this PR, I think the big takeaway is to quit spending so much time focused on moving heavy weight and get in some volume. Deep Water had me using 70% of my 10rm for all my work sets, which was around 55% of my 1rm, but I was using it for 10x10. It was a ton of volume, I put on some good weight, and coming off of it, now that I&rsquo;m focused on moving heavier weight, I have a MUCH larger amount of room the progress.</p> <p>Intensification works by pulling from the volume you&rsquo;ve accumulated. The greater the accumulation, the greater the intensification effect. If you don&rsquo;t have a deep well to pull from, you won&rsquo;t go far. If you&rsquo;ve been struggling with your press, try to spend a LONG training cycle really hammering the volume on ALL your pressing muscles and eating well, and then come back.</p> </div><br/><br/>\nSubmitted March 16, 2019 at 06:04AM by MythicalStrength<br/>\nvia reddit <a href=\"https://ift.tt/2TG439f\" target=\"_blank\">https://ift.tt/2TG439f</a>",

The only reason we keep it around is due to the fact that we have kids that wonder regarding just how much weight they are acquiring as they expand. </p><p>Barbara Rolls is a lecturer of nourishment at Penn State College and also in this article she clarified that, &ldquo;Several well-controlled research studies discovered that day-to-day weighing aids with both fat burning as well as the prevention of weight gain.&rdquo; I admire Rolls&rsquo; approach to concentrating on eating low-caloric density foods, but I think she&rsquo;s missing the bigger image on the concern. </p><p><strong>The very first problem: The range lies</strong></p><p>Rolls advises weighing yourself first thing in the morning, naked, after bowel movement. The idea is to create the same conditions throughout each weigh-in to lessen the effect of daily variations in body weight. The issue is, also following that insight isn&rsquo;t really visiting regulate for other variables such as acquiring muscle mass, as well as water retention from elements like high carbohydrate and/or salt intake.</p><p>Think of this: you&rsquo;re seeming like you&rsquo;re succeeding. You look better and also feel far better regarding the progress you have actually made regarding obtaining in form. You tip on the scale and because of some muscular tissue gains and/or water retention, you understand you have actually gained a couple of extra pounds. Just what does that do to your motivation?</p><p>Back in 2004 I supervised of a fitness obstacle for 2 pupils, Rory and also Audrey, at the University of Calgary. We put them via an intense five-month diet as well as workout program. They both had fantastic prior to as well as after pictures, and were both far more potent, much more muscle, and fitter by the end of the program. Audrey shed an overall of merely 6 pounds in those 5 months, as well as she looked impressive. Rory, well, he <em>gained</em> a pound. The individual shed a bunch of excess weight, however obtained everything back, and afterwards some, in muscular tissue. </p><p>In various other words, the range did nothing to reflect their true achievements. </p><p><strong>The second trouble: Body weight is a bad indicator of health</strong></p><p>If a person is morbidly obese according to body mass index, they can endure myriad health issue. Just being in the &lsquo;obese&rsquo; range is not much cause for worry. A recent research out of the College of Manitoba states, &ldquo;Overweight individuals did not have a massive rise in illness or sudden death.&rdquo; </p><p>An obese person who exercises, eats a healthy and balanced diet regimen, and maintains their stress levels moderate is visiting be a great deal healthier than an inactive individual in the typical BMI variety that eats crap. Duration. </p><p><strong>But weighing worked. Why?</strong></p><p>Participants in the studies Rolls quoted were instructed to act when the scale claimed they were regaining weight. Simply puts, they were keeping their brains concentrated on way of living modifications to keep that scale number where they desired it.</p><p>Improving your health and wellness, physical fitness, as well as body composition needs constant devotion to behavior change. To achieve this, tracking numbers is great, however pointering on a scale tracks the incorrect numbers.</p><p><strong>What you should be concentrating on, long-term</strong></p><p>As I&rsquo;ve aimed out in the past, the number on the scale is not worth considering. Below are better outcomes to work towards<br/></p><ul><li> Feeling great</li> <li> Looking great/improved body structure (Indicating <em>you</em> like the method you look. Don&rsquo;t contrast yourself to some heavily Photoshopped version or starlet whose job it is to be slim.) </li> <li> Should purchase smaller sized clothes</li> <li> Improved cardiac danger elements such as better cholesterol numbers and also decreased blood pressure</li> <li> Increased energy levels</li> <li> Increased strength, endurance and flexibility</li> <li> Reduced tension and raised happiness</li> </ul><p><strong>What you need to be concentrating on, short-term</strong></p><p>To reach the prior outcomes, you should undergo a procedure. These procedures come to be behaviors. Permanent way of living adjustment is everything about adopting as well as sticking with specific behaviors, as well as tipping on a range everyday is not a worthwhile behavior. </p><p>I&rsquo;m a large fan of monitoring. It&rsquo;s a tested technique for both workout adherence as well as staying with dietary adjustments. Allow&rsquo;s simplify: </p><p><strong>1. Diet tracking</strong></p><p>A bunch of people protest tracking calorie consumption, but I consider it the big gun of fat loss (and also yes, I recognize this contradicts just what I blogged about ignoring the range, but allow&rsquo;s confess that you could have losing body fat as an objective as well as still overlook your range). </p><p>If you absolutely are not achieving your preferred changes in body make-up, it suggests you&rsquo;re still eating also several calories. Keeping a precise journal of every last nibble you eat is the supreme tool. </p><p>It&rsquo;s additionally a nuisance, so I consider it a last option. Rather, attempt concentrating on getting to these numbers: <br/></p><ul><li> High: Fruit and veggie intake</li> <li> Reduced: Consuming out and/or consuming refined foods</li> <li> High: Variety of times each week you go to sleep a little hungry</li> <li> Reduced: Frequency with which you eat past being satisfied</li> <li> High: Frequency of consuming breakfast</li> <li> Low: Avoiding meals in the first fifty percent of the day</li> <li> High: Family members meals at the supper table</li> <li>  Low: Alcohol intake</li> </ul><p>Those are good numbers to track. Here are some more.</p><p><strong>Exercise tracking</strong></p><p>For workout, keep an eye on your numerical achievements with several of these examples: <br/></p><ul><li>Number of kilometers run/swum/cycled/ hiked/walked/skied/ etc.</li> <li>  Amount of weight lifted</li> <li>  Number of visits to the gym</li> <li> Variety of physical fitness classes attended</li> <li> Variety of times you decided to move rather of sitting</li> <li> Strength degree at which you exercised</li> <li> Length of time spent exercising</li> </ul><p>Again, tracking progression as well as behaviors is a great concept. It will maintain you concentrated and it will result not merely in fat loss, but in an entire host of various other favorable life changes. </p><p>So take that range and also bury it under some old clothes in the storage space area. A year from currently, if you&rsquo;re interested, you could draw it out as well as have a look. The range is not your pal. You need to go beyond. </p><p><strong>James S.
