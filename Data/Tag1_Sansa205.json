        "body": "<p>Time to do some more parallel readings, this time with Jon\nSnow. This is a very different sort of reading from the Daenerys one (which is <a href=\"http://kallypsowrites.tumblr.com/post/180456877410/the-many-readings-of-game-of-thrones-part-1\">here</a>): mostly\nbecause no one is arguing that Jon is an antagonist. Or if they are, I sure\nhaven\u2019t seen it anywhere. This is perhaps because Jon is our most\nstraightforward hero left. He\u2019s the guy with the sword. The man with the easiest\nto plot hero\u2019s journey. He has gone from a bastard of Winterfell to the King in\nthe North. And over all? People really like Jon.<br/></p><p>The main friction in the fandom seems to be Jonerys vs Jonsa\nright now but both of those groups? They love the heck out of Jon. And honestly\nI don\u2019t think Jon gets a whole lot of hate. At most he gets&hellip;neutral shrugs\nfrom the part of the fandom that just doesn\u2019t care that much about him. He also\ngets accused of being too cookie cutter as a hero sometimes. \u00a0I think the most controversial thing he did\nwas bend the knee in season seven and we\u2019re going to cover the interpretations\nof why he did that&hellip;later.</p><p>In fact this is going to be structured differently from the\nDaenerys reading. Because while my different readings of Daenerys start at the\nvery beginning of her journey, Jon\u2019s readings don\u2019t diverge until&hellip;later. Up\nuntil season six, in fact, the fandom has a pretty united opinion about him and\nit\u2019s really not until season seven that the conflict really starts. So first,\nlet\u2019s start with what everyone can agree on: Who is Jon Snow? More under the cut</p><!-- more --><p><b>Jon Snow: From\nBastard to Reluctant Ruler</b></p><p>Jon Snow begins Game of Thrones as a Bastard of Winterfell\nwith no claim to any lands or titles or even his family name. But still, he is\nwell loved by his family, which was uncommon treatment for bastards at the\ntime. He is not content with his life and longs to join the wall instead to\nescape the fact that he is not a true Stark. He, like many of the other\ncharacters, has rather na\u00efve ideas about the world and about honor. It is only\nafter joining the Wall that he realizes the truth of things. The Night\u2019s Watch\nis not as grand an honor as he first expected and nor are the wildlings an evil\nmob trying to break past the wall to destroy Westeros.</p><p>Jon\u2019s journey is the most typical \u2018hero\u2019s journey\u2019 in the\nwhole series, and he truly grows from a boy to a man over the seasons. He learns\nto shift his black and white view and challenge the preconceived norms. He\ninfiltrates the wildlings, proves his mettle in battle and is eventually\nelected as the Lord Commander because of his bravery. But, when he realizes the\ntrue threat to the north (the white walkers) he begins to make controversial\ndecisions that eventually lead to his death.</p><p>Until season five, Jon Snow\u2019s journey is typical to that of\nNed and Robb Stark. All three are good leaders and respected by those who\nfollow them. But all three make awful mistakes and do not account for the\ntreachery of men. And for that, they are all killed. Ned believes Littlefinger\nand thinks it is a good idea to warn Cersei, Robb attends a wedding at the\nTwins thinking guest rite will keep him safe, and Jon never thinks that his own\nmen would break their vows by killing him after he lets the wildlings past the\nwall.</p><p>But unlike Ned and Robb, Jon is returned to life.</p><p>This seems to suggest Jon has a higher calling: a calling to\nwarn the world about the Others. This is also the moment when he begins to\nbecome \u2018exceptional\u2019. Whereas before he was a mere bastard with no claims who\nlived and died by his deeds alone, now the writers begin to upturn everything\nwe thought we knew about Jon. First, he breaks the \u2018death is final\u2019 rule that\nmost of the characters are bound by. Then he leaves the Night\u2019s Watch because,\nwell, he died, so that\u2019s a nice loop hole. He helps take back Winterfell and,\ndespite thinking he would never, ever have any claim there, he is named King in\nthe North. And NOW we know that he is a Targaryen: the son of Rhaegar and\nLyanna (though most of the characters are currently unaware of this).</p><p>Jon has a very typical hero\u2019s journey in this way. Just an\nordinary guy, living his life with no designs on power. Then as time goes on it\nturns out he actually IS exceptional and may just be destined to save the whole\nworld. It\u2019s typical and, on paper, juuuust a little bit boring. Like I said at\nthe beginning, he\u2019s a bit of a cookie cutter hero. His arc is well executed but\nwe\u2019ve seen his story before. I think the major thing in Jon\u2019s favor is that his\nexceptionalism does not come into play until way far down his arc. And his\nstatus as a lost Targaryen prince remains unknown to him. Had he discovered his\n\u2018exceptional\u2019 qualities earlier (Harry Potter style), it\u2019s likely that his arc\nwould be that of a typical chosen one. But, what people seem to like about him,\nis that he has <i>earned </i>much of the\nrespect he now has. He was chosen by the people because of his words <i>and </i>actions. And hey, we love the story\nof an underdog. But then&hellip;comes season seven.</p><p><b>Characters paralleled with Jon</b></p><p>Before we get to season seven stuff, I want to talk about characters often paralleled with Jon. The obvious character is Daenerys, and I talked about their parallels more in the Daenerys post. But also:</p><p>Sansa Stark: Jon\u2019s plot hit a lot of the same beats as Sansa\u2019s arc. They are both far away from home and isolated, they both have to survive in a place where they can\u2019t be honest (in King\u2019s Landing vs the wildlings) They have their lowest point at round abouts the same time. Season five ends with both of their futures/lives being uncertain (Jon got stabbed and Sansa jumped off a building).\u00a0 And then of course, when they came together in season six, they have both been on each other\u2019s team ever since, steadily growing as rulers. This is what a lot of Jonsas look to as important foreshadowing that they will eventually rule together as King and Queen.</p><p>Arya Stark: Jon and Arya were always the black sheep of the family and two of the closest siblings. Arya carries needle with her still so Jon gave her the first means to defend herself and was one of the few who took her seriously even as a child. There are more parallels between them in the book, but their reunion is one of the most built up things ever, so it will definetily make a splash in season 8. Also it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if one of them had to watch the other die because of their closeness.</p><p>Bran Stark: Jon and Bran are both the ones who have seen the Night King and are the ones most dedicated to stopping the Others. But Bran knows more than Jon. He saw Jon in season four while Jon was oblivious to him being there. Bran saw the Night King in visions and knew that something bad was coming long before Jon. And, now, Bran is the one who understands Jon\u2019s past. This foreshadows Bran being an important guide for Jon in season 8. He will be the one to reveal his true name.</p><p>Mance Rayder: Mance, like Jon, was chosen for leadership and Jon and he clearly had respect for each other as Jon eventually saves him from being burned to death. But season seven called an explicit parallel to Jon and Mance when Daenerys unknowingly quotes Jon in the cave:\u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t their survival more important than your pride?\u201d Mance, in his conversation, replies\u00a0\u201cFuck my pride\u201d because he knows its not about that. Jon, likewise, is not ruling the north for his pride. However this parallel with Mance is suggested as a reason he ultimately bends the knee.</p><p>Stannis: Stannis is the failed Azor Ahai where as Jon seems to, apparently, be the real Azor Ahai. Melisandre switches to believing in Jon after Stannis\u2019 death and ressurects him. And Davos now advises Jon instead of Stannis. There is a sense that Jon is the new and improved Stannis who is just but is more merciful. He is the true\u00a0\u2018prince that was promised\u2019. Daenerys could also be involved in this parallel.</p><p>Jaime: This is a much more subtle parallel because these two sort of run on opposite paths to each other. When Jaime and Jon meet (in a show-only scene), Jaime mocks Jon for his commitment to the Night\u2019s Watch. Jaime is bitter and over the world. Jon is naive and still believes the Night Watch to be full of heroes. Over the course of the show, Jaime has slowly regained his honor and vows have become important to him again, shown by him leaving Cersei to journey north and honor his pledge. Jon, on the other hand, has learned that the Night\u2019s Watch wasn\u2019t full of honor after all and that the world is a darker place. He even broke his own vows in season three. He is now more bitter about the world, but wiser. They seem to have met in the middle now. Jaime is not as awful and Jon is not as stupid. And they could become strong allies which is in direct conflict with their first meeting.</p><p>Ned and Robb: Of course, I briefly mentioned this already, but Jon seems to continuously follow in the footsteps of other Stark men. Both his father and brother were honorable and died. So did Jon though he, unlike them, gets a second chance.</p><p>Theon: Jon and Theon were both not quite Stark sons who wanted to be Stark sons and had a competitive relationship with Robb (and also each other) because of it. Theon made the wrong choice about his family (Greyjoy vs Stark) and Jon will soon face a choice of his own (Stark vs Targaryen) which will become clear in season eight.</p><p>Alright. Now that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way:</p><p><b>Season Seven Jon and\n\u201cthe Problem\u201d</b></p><p>So, fresh off of being raised to King in the North by his\npeople, Jon decides to bend the knee to Daenerys. Not instantly, of course. He\nputs up a fight about it for a while, not wanting to bend the knee to a woman\nhe barely knows. But eventually, after the wight hunt, he decides to put his\ntrust in Daenerys. He even goes so far as to tell Cersei about the alliance,\nalmost completely losing her help against the wights.</p><p>This was&hellip;let\u2019s say&hellip;a controversial decision.</p><p>In my investigation of Jon\u2019s tag on tumblr, this was by far\nthe thing people were most irritated about. Throwing away northern independence\nfor Daenerys did not sit well with some. And as far as I can tell, the reaction\nfell into three categories:</p><p><b>Number one: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is right and consistent with his character because he truly believes\nin Daenerys as a ruler and maybe it was a little dumb to tell Cersei about it,\nbut it was honorable and that is the Stark way.</b></p><p><b>Number 2: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is consistent with his character but that character should have gotten\nfucking smarter by now, like, come on Jon, can\u2019t you tell one single lie to\nCersei, and also your brother Robb did not work this hard for northern\nindependence so that you could throw it away at the drop of a hat you absolute\npiece of&ndash;</b></p><p><b>And Number 3: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is not what it seems and he has secret political agenda behind bending\nthe knee to Daenerys and he is playing the game now just like everyone else,\nwhich marks substantial character growth from \u201cthe northern fool\u201d.</b></p><p>Just like the first time I am going to give all three of\nthese theories a fair shake from the perspective of those who believe in them.\nAnd, once again, none of these theories are without merit or precedence. I\u2019m\nnot covering theories that I think are totally contradicted by canon. I am also\nnot taking into account outside influences like the books or the actors\nopinions etc. I am going to try to make this a show only reading. Which one you\nagree with? Well that\u2019s up to you, but I hope we can once again all see each\nother\u2019s points of view and have a respectful discussion. Everyone was very nice\non the Daenerys post! So, without further ado:</p><p><b>Theory 1: Honest Jon</b></p><p>This theory takes Jon at his word on \u2018why he bent the knee\u2019,\nand it posits that his honesty and honor are his most prominent and important\ntraits. It\u2019s easy to see why. As I said earlier, Jon is perhaps the most\nstraight forward moral main character remaining to us. And he has always\nstriven to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. So when he says \u201cI am true to my\nword&hellip;or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot\nserve two queens when I have already pledged myself to Daenerys of House\nTargaryen\u201d he is being honest. </p><p>It may seem like a stupid decision to be honest with Cersei,\nand that is indeed what got his father killed. But Jon acknowledges that fact\nwhen Tyrion demands an explanation: \u201cI\u2019m not going to swear an oath I can\u2019t\nuphold. Talk about my father if you want and tell me that\u2019s the attitude that\ngot him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning\nanything. Then there are no more answers and better and better lies. And lies\nwon\u2019t help us in this fight.\u201d</p><p>This seems to solidify Jon as our most \u201cmoral hero\u201d. When\neveryone else goes low, he goes high. Even though experience and everyone\naround him tells him to learn from his fathers mistakes and maybe stoop to\nplaying the game just once, he seems to prefer to honor Ned\u2019s memory by living\nas he did.</p><p>There is something honorable about this. The fact that Jon,\nwho died doing what he thought was right and got a rare second chance, still\nrefuses to play the game, makes him extraordinary in some way. And maybe it is\nwhat makes him fit to be a king. He really isn\u2019t too proud or too power hungry.\nHe does what he thinks is best for his people and in this particular theory, he\nthinks Daenerys is best for Westeros (we will talk about why in a bit). He\nwants to win this game a different way, which is a respectable notion. Many\npeople on this theory, it is fair to mention, support Jonerys, so this moment\nis also seen as a declaration of loyalty to his partner (which sweetens the\ndeal for the shippers).</p><p>Then, there\u2019s <b>Theory\n2: The Northern Fool, </b>which is held primarily by people who think Jon is an\nabsolute dumb ass. This is actually kind of a ship neutral theory? I\u2019ve seen\nJonerys, Jonsa and non-shippers all pass this theory around. That \u00a0Jon is stupid and, likewise, so are the\nwriters. </p><p>Because <i>sure </i>Jon,\nhonor and honesty is all fine and dandy, but it seems as if you\u2019ve been\npreaching a lot about \u2018the greater good\u2019. The greater good which is defeating\nthe white walkers. So maybe the world will forgive one single lie.</p><p>People in this group side with Tyrion and Daenerys in this\nscenario. Like, thank you Jon for your loyalty but maybe make sure that the\nsuicide squad mission is actually worth it and not a complete waste of time. Or\nsomething. Maybe if the past few episodes could actually have some payoff, that\nwould be rad. I love not having my time wasted.</p><p>Support for this theory tends to spill over onto critique\nfor the writers, which we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about later. Many viewers\nthink that Jon isn\u2019t meant to be as stupid as he comes across here. The\nwriters, it seems, are trying to get all viewers feel like the theory one\nsupporters, but their writing is kind of&hellip;meh during this season? They don\u2019t\nmake an effective case, in this scene, for Jon\u2019s honesty. Because maybe they\u2019re\njust forgetting how to do character development. Lord knows they forgot about\nArya\u2019s character development this season, so why not?</p><p>People in this camp also tend to agree with Sansa\u2019s line in\nthe first episode of season 7: That Jon needs to be smarter than his father and\nRobb because they died. This line seems like explicit advice that Jon should\nhave taken and the fact that he didn\u2019t perhaps foreshadows a bleak end for him.\nBut, of course, we\u2019ll get more into Jon\u2019s ending later. Right now, we\u2019re just\ntalking about his shining moment in the dragon pit.</p><p>The long and short of this theory is thus: Jon is true to\ncharacter, perhaps, but it only emphasizes how little he has grown and that he\nis doomed to make the same mistakes as his father and brother. A northern fool,\nuntil the end.</p><p>In both these theories, Jon has bent the knee to Daenerys\nwith sincerity. So we need to take a quick break to talk about why before we\nmove onto the outsider theory. </p><p>Why does Jon believe in Daenerys? What prompts him to bend\nthe knee in the boat? According to most readings, it is Daenerys\u2019 change of\nheart. Throughout much of the season, Daenerys refuses to help Jon until he\nbends the knee. But in the boat, after seeing the true threat of the undead,\nshe believes him and vows to help him. No stipulations. No command for him to\nbend the knee. Believers of these theories put THIS as the moment. Because\nDaenerys is no longer demanding that he kneel, she is now acknowledging him as\nan equal and putting the people before her own pride (just like she told him to\ndo a few episodes previous). Because of her willingness to do this, and the\nfact that she came north to save them at great personal cost, he deems her\nworthy of being his queen.</p><p>Yes, he is supposedly giving up the north, but in his mind\nhe is putting it in good hands. And it isn\u2019t as if Jon is power hungry. He\ndoesn\u2019t really want power at all. He just wants to be sure that his people will\nbe safe and perhaps queen Daenerys and her dragons are the best way to ensure\nthat.</p><p>But then, there is a theory that posits that Jon\u2019s motives\nin season seven are not stupid at all, but rather they are a part of an\nintentional strategy. And this, of course, brings us to Political! Jon.</p><p><b>Theory 3: Political\nJon</b></p><p>This theory is going to take me a little bit longer to\nexplain. Because while theory one and two tend to take Jon\u2019s characterization\nat the surface level, this theory involves a lot of reading in between the\nlines. But first: a disclaimer. I think many people are under the impression\nthat all of those people who subscribe to Political Jon are Jonsas. This is\nlargely used to dismiss political Jon as being a delusion created in attempt to\nsupport a ship. But Political! Jon is by no means a theory exclusive to Jonsas\nand I wouldn\u2019t be covering it as a theory if I thought it was completely\ncontradicted by canon.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is: Most people\ngravitate toward Political! Jon NOT for the purpose of their favorite ship, but\nbecause of their love of Jon himself&ndash;and their deep and abiding desire for him\nto not be completely stupid.</p><p>Subscribers of theory two believe that Jon is stupid but\nhave accepted that as an error of the writing. Political Jon believers think\nthat his supposed \u201cstupidity\u201d is highly intentional and actually his own way of\nplaying the game. So. Let\u2019s break it down.</p><p>In this theory, Jon does not truly have feelings for\nDaenerys, nor does he think she will be a good queen. However, he does not see\nher as someone to trifle with and he knows that he will need her help to defeat\nthe White walkers. He also sees her as stronger than Cersei and better than\nCersei, so when he is asked to swear neutrality in the dragon pit, he sides with\nDaenerys just to make SURE that Daenerys buys his loyalty. He thinks that\nDaenerys will easily beat Cersei in a fight anyway.</p><p>First: the lying thing. Can honest Jon bring himself to lie\nto Daenerys? Can he bring himself to deceive at all when he strives to be so\nlike his father, Eddard Stark? And is there any precedent for him lying for the\ngreater good?</p><p>Turns out: Yes. Let\u2019s take a gander at season 3, shall we?</p><p>In season 3, Jon is captured by a group of wildlings and is\ncommanded by his superior, the Half Hand, to do whatever he can to gather\ninformation about Mance\u2019s army. This is, after all, a matter of grave\nimportance. It\u2019s not just Jon\u2019s life that is on the line&ndash;it\u2019s the lives of\neveryone beyond the wall if the wildlings get past.</p><p>So Jon kills the Halfhand and gains the trust of the\nwildlings. But he does more than that. He lies about the number of men at\nCastle Black, he lies about his motives and reasons for joining them, and he\neven breaks his vows by sleeping with a wildling woman. He has to keep up the\nact and does so pretty well, until he cannot bring himself to kill an innocent\nman south of the wall. Then he breaks and kills the wildling that was most\nsuspicious of him, proclaiming in a spiteful tone \u201cyou were right the whole\ntime\u201d.</p><p>Jon may not be one who lies easily, but he lies when it\ncounts. He is willing to lie for the greater good. So&hellip;is it in character for\nhim to lie in season seven?</p><p>According to this theory, yes. Jon is concerned with one\nthing and one thing only: figure out a way to stop the White Walkers so he can\nprotect his people in the North. If the white walkers break through, the north\nwill be the first to suffer so he must make <i>absolutely\nsure </i>that doesn\u2019t happen. He goes south to Dragonstone to meet with Queen\nDaenerys because he has no other choice. She has the dragon glass they need <i>and </i>she could be a valuable ally in the\nfight.</p><p>However, in Jon\u2019s first meeting with her, he gets nowhere.\nHe is relatively honest in this meeting, pointing out that his people won\u2019t\nbend to a southern ruler and that he has no reason to bow to her because he\nbarely knows her. As a result of this conversation, he is ostensibly made a\nprisoner of the island. He can go where he wants but not to his ship. He can\u2019t\nhelp his people from the island so he needs to find out another way.</p><p>This is an important thing to note for people who don\u2019t know\nmuch about political Jon: Most of the believers of this theory are not saying\nthat Jon went to Dragonstone with the intent of being political. He did not hop\non a ship to \u2018go seduce the dragon queen\u2019. Of course not. Jon would only play\nthe manipulating game in the direst of circumstances. Rather, there is a point\nin season seven that, for many, marks Jon\u2019s shift from straight forward honesty\nto more subtle motivations. And it\u2019s his conversation with Tyrion.</p><p>Here, Jon realizes he has been \u2018a northern fool\u2019. He\nacknowledges it. He acknowledges that he should have listened to his men and to\nSansa when they said, \u2018don\u2019t go south\u2019. But this acknowledgement isn\u2019t worth\nmuch unless he switches tactics. If he just says \u2018I\u2019m stupid\u2019 but doesn\u2019t\nchange, then who cares? Now he has to actually listen to Sansa\u2019s advice. Be\nsmarter than father. Be smarter than Robb.</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t abandon honestly all together, of course. He\nstill wants to prove to Daenerys that the white walkers exist. He wants to\npersuade her to see his side because if she doesn\u2019t, his people will probably\nall die. As he tries to get a read on this queen, he realizes a couple of\nimportant things: One, when she is angry she tends to jump to dragons and needs\nto be advised not to set King\u2019s Landing on fire and two, she is very wrapped up\nin the idea of Targaryen exceptionalism. She hates the idea of being just like\neverybody else.</p><p>So he plays to this. When she asks him what she should do in\nresponse to a losing battles, he implies that using her dragons against\ninnocents WOULD make her just like everybody else. And she wants to be more\nthan that. With just this one line, he is able to convince her to not burn King\u2019s\nLanding. Clearly Jon is beginning to understand how Daenerys works.</p><p>But still, he understands she is dangerous. At some point,\nhe decides that if he wants to really protect his people, he is going to need\nto be sure she is on their side. So he bends the knee in the boat. This is at a\nhopeless moment for Jon, after he\u2019s faced the army of the dead and realized how\nmuch help they are going to need. He doesn\u2019t want to surrender his people to a\nsouthern ruler, but he also knows independence won\u2019t last forever. Eventually,\nshe\u2019ll want to bring the north into the fold, so better to do it peacefully and\nprotect everyone.</p><p>Eventually, he even gives himself over to her in the\nbedroom. This is a progression from what happened with Ygritte. Ygritte made\nher want of Jon known and then demanded he break his vows to prove his loyalty.\nSo he did, and in doing so, earned her devotion. This time, he sees that\nDaenerys is developing feelings for him. So he decides to take the initiative\nhimself and visit her on the boat, giving himself to her to secure her loyalty\nto the north. Many people pointed out that having sex with a woman out of\nmarriage is a little bit out of character for Jon who vowed never to sire a bastard\n(and in a world where sex outside of marriage, especially for women, is heavily\nscorned). Unless of course, he\u2019s giving into what she wants (just like Ygritte\ndid). Apparently there was also a deleted scene or moment in the script when\nDaenerys<i> asked</i> him to come to her\nroom? Whatever, that\u2019s not relevant to this interpretation because we\u2019re only\nfocusing on what we get from the screen.</p><p>Again, all of this is done without malice from Jon. I saw a\npost arguing that political Jon meant Dark! Jon because he was manipulating\nDaenerys feelings. I think in some interpretations this is true, but in others,\nit seems Jon isn\u2019t planning to \u2018break Daenerys\u2019 heart\u2019. He\u2019s entering into this\nsomewhat like a woman might enter into an arranged marriage in this time&ndash;\u201cthis\nwill bring peace and she wants it, so fine. This is what\u2019s best for my people.\u201d</p><p>Many people believe that this is not Jon straight up\ntricking Daenerys with the plan of going \u2018just kidding! It was all a lie!\u2019\nlater on. It\u2019s Jon trying to secure the north. It\u2019s entirely likely that he\nplans to keep his word. But, just like with the wildlings, if Daenerys goes too\nfar or asks too much of Jon, he will break away. If it becomes clear that he\ncannot contain her \u2018fire and blood\u2019 impulses, he will abandon her and return to\nfighting for his people.</p><p>So the precedent for Political Jon is set by Jon\u2019s season\nthree journey, but a lot of the evidence is found in Kit\u2019s acting. Many have\nobserved that in a lot of scenes, Jon does not appear all too thrilled with\nDaenerys. In some, he even looks uncomfortable. In the view of believers of\nthis theory, this acting choice is intentional and made to alert us to the fact\nthat Daenerys cares for Jon more than he cares for her. Which, yes, maybe. That\u2019s\na perfectly valid reading but&hellip;also&hellip;Kit\u2019s acting is kind of&hellip;wooden?</p><p>I mean it started out way more wooden and he\u2019s gotten better\nover time. But he\u2019s usually not one for a range of facial expressions. He does\nbetter depending on what actor he is working with. I think perhaps one of the\nreasons that Jonsa has become such a popular ship is that Kit has great\nchemistry on screen with Sophie Turner. He, likewise, had very good chemistry\nwith Rose. There are moments of good acting from Jon in season seven, but in a\nlot of scenes he just seems vaguely tired.</p><p>And this is the main debate to be had. Are all of these\nacting, writing and directing choices actually intentional? Or are they just errors?\nIt could just be that some of the dialogue was uninspired and Kit needed better\ndirection. Or it could be a very subtle build up. Regardless, we won\u2019t know for\nsure until we see season 8.</p><p><b>Jon\u2019s end:\nSacrificial Hero or King?</b></p><p>Putting aside the debate of whether or not Jon is political,\nwe need to talk about where he will end up. There are three possibilities for\nthis too (because three is a good number), and they actually quite mirror\nDaenerys\u2019 possibilities.</p><p><b>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>On the throne with Daenerys</b></p><p><b>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>A Sacrificial hero</b></p><p><b>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>On the throne without Daenerys (possibly\nwith Sansa)</b></p><p>So, first off, Jon and Daenerys could end up being the song\nof ice and fire together and the two Targaryens to bring about a restoration of\nthe Targaryen name, perhaps this time with less incest? (No sibling marriages\nguys. Please. A whole book just came out about why that fucked things up). It\nmakes sense on a symbolic level. The story begins with the Targaryens being\noutcasts and gone and could end with them once again being in power. Also, while\nDaenerys has been a contender for the throne since the very beginning, Jon has\nonly become a contender as recently as the end of season six, which means him\nending up on the throne would add an additional twist.</p><p>On the whole, both Targaryen heirs ending up on the throne\nand starting a new family does seem a little too happy and easy and perfect for\nGame of Thrones, so if this did happen, there would have to be collateral\ndamage of another sort. The deaths of other characters, perhaps the loss of\nwinterfell or even the destruction of the Red Keep itself. It\u2019s even likely\nthat if they rule together it will NOT be from the Iron Throne (because that\nthrone may very well get destroyed).</p><p>On the other hand, Jon could be a <b>sacrificial hero </b>and give his life in the battle to destroy the\nNight King. Now some might say: wait. Jon already died once. What would be the\npoint of just killing him off again? Well, this would actually play very well\ninto the heavy weight of death on this show. One of the major running themes of\ngame of thrones is \u2018Valar Morghulis\u2019. All men must die. If this is not the case\nand dead loved ones can be brought back without consequences, then death loses\na lot of weight. </p><p>There is a sense that perhaps Jon\u2019s return from the dead is\nonly temporary. He has come back to warn Westeros about the White Walkers,\nfight to save the realm and then die in the process. If this is the case, then\nit would put forth the message that no one can escape death. Sometimes, very\nrarely, you get a second chance. But that doesn\u2019t make you immortal. It is not\nJon\u2019s time yet but that time is coming soon. We see this foreshadowed with\nBerric Dondarian, who is a veteran at coming back. Now that Thoros of Myr is\ndead, his days are numbered as well. All of the dead will return to the ground\nbefore this series is over and Jon with them.</p><p>Or, perhaps not. In the third theory, Jon becomes king of\nthe Seven Kingdoms. Again, as he is a newer candidate for the throne, this is\nmore unexpected than Daenerys. Some who believe in this theory think that\nDaenerys will die as a hero and leave Jon alone to reluctantly carry on her\nlegacy. He\u2019s not a power hungry person and doesn\u2019t want the throne, but he\u2019s\nthe kind of character that keeps vows and does his duty. He will serve the\nrealm as its ruler even though his love is gone.</p><p>Or perhaps Daenerys is not his love. Perhaps, if the Dark\nDaenerys theory becomes real, he will be among those who help defeat her and\nthen become king of Westeros much the same way he became king of the North.\nBecause the people chose him. Those who subscribe to this theory often see him\nwith Sansa by his side as a wife (though that is not a requirement of this\ntheory). Whether he is romantically involved with Sansa or not, Jon will rely\nheavily on the Starks in this time as they are the ones who truly matter most\nto him.</p><p>And this brings us to the final question about Jon. <b>Stark or Targaryen?</b> Which of his sides\nwill he embrace or will he hold them both equally? I think for an answer to\nthis we have to go to Jon\u2019s scene with Theon in the Dragonstone throne room.\nThere are two important lines here. One is this: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to choose. You\u2019re\na Greyjoy and a Stark\u201d. This seems to be hinting that Jon himself will \u2018not\nchoose\u2019. He will also embrace being both a Stark and a Targaryen in equal\nparts. <i>However </i>there\u2019s another line\nas well: \u201cHe (Ned Stark) was more a father to you than your own father\u201d. And\nthis seems to suggest that yes, even though Jon was born a Targaryen, nurture\ntrumps nature in this case. Rhaegar may be his blood father but <i>Ned </i>is the one who raised Jon. So\nultimately, his Stark half will be more important to him.</p><p>This scene could be read both ways. There\u2019s no scenario\nwhere Jon abandons his Stark heritage. Whether you see Jon\u2019s relationship with\nSansa as romantic or not it is VERY clear that he cares deeply about her. He\nalso cares very deeply about Arya and Bran (who I know I haven\u2019t talked a lot\nabout here in this piece but they\u2019ll get their own post, promise). We just\nhaven\u2019t gotten the chance to see him interact with them yet. He only just found\nout they were alive, after all. But there\u2019s no scenario where Jon turns his\nback on his family. But whether or not he chooses the Starks over the\nTargaryens or balances the two remains to be seen. </p><p>That\u2019s it for this read on Jon. Again, keep the comments\nrespectful and the discussion understanding. It\u2019s okay that people have\ndifferent perspectives than you! I obviously have a reading that I think is\nmost likely but I\u2019m not telling any of you here, lol.</p><p> Next time I\u2019m going\nto tackle Sansa and the many possible readings of her character. Happy\nThronesing everyone!</p>",

So first,\nlet\u2019s start with what everyone can agree on: Who is Jon Snow? More under the cut</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>Jon Snow: From\nBastard to Reluctant Ruler</b></p><p>Jon Snow begins Game of Thrones as a Bastard of Winterfell\nwith no claim to any lands or titles or even his family name. But still, he is\nwell loved by his family, which was uncommon treatment for bastards at the\ntime. He is not content with his life and longs to join the wall instead to\nescape the fact that he is not a true Stark. He, like many of the other\ncharacters, has rather na\u00efve ideas about the world and about honor. It is only\nafter joining the Wall that he realizes the truth of things. The Night\u2019s Watch\nis not as grand an honor as he first expected and nor are the wildlings an evil\nmob trying to break past the wall to destroy Westeros.</p><p>Jon\u2019s journey is the most typical \u2018hero\u2019s journey\u2019 in the\nwhole series, and he truly grows from a boy to a man over the seasons. He learns\nto shift his black and white view and challenge the preconceived norms. He\ninfiltrates the wildlings, proves his mettle in battle and is eventually\nelected as the Lord Commander because of his bravery. But, when he realizes the\ntrue threat to the north (the white walkers) he begins to make controversial\ndecisions that eventually lead to his death.</p><p>Until season five, Jon Snow\u2019s journey is typical to that of\nNed and Robb Stark. All three are good leaders and respected by those who\nfollow them. But all three make awful mistakes and do not account for the\ntreachery of men. And for that, they are all killed. Ned believes Littlefinger\nand thinks it is a good idea to warn Cersei, Robb attends a wedding at the\nTwins thinking guest rite will keep him safe, and Jon never thinks that his own\nmen would break their vows by killing him after he lets the wildlings past the\nwall.</p><p>But unlike Ned and Robb, Jon is returned to life.</p><p>This seems to suggest Jon has a higher calling: a calling to\nwarn the world about the Others. This is also the moment when he begins to\nbecome \u2018exceptional\u2019. Whereas before he was a mere bastard with no claims who\nlived and died by his deeds alone, now the writers begin to upturn everything\nwe thought we knew about Jon. First, he breaks the \u2018death is final\u2019 rule that\nmost of the characters are bound by. Then he leaves the Night\u2019s Watch because,\nwell, he died, so that\u2019s a nice loop hole. He helps take back Winterfell and,\ndespite thinking he would never, ever have any claim there, he is named King in\nthe North. And NOW we know that he is a Targaryen: the son of Rhaegar and\nLyanna (though most of the characters are currently unaware of this).</p><p>Jon has a very typical hero\u2019s journey in this way. Just an\nordinary guy, living his life with no designs on power. Then as time goes on it\nturns out he actually IS exceptional and may just be destined to save the whole\nworld. It\u2019s typical and, on paper, juuuust a little bit boring. Like I said at\nthe beginning, he\u2019s a bit of a cookie cutter hero. His arc is well executed but\nwe\u2019ve seen his story before. I think the major thing in Jon\u2019s favor is that his\nexceptionalism does not come into play until way far down his arc. And his\nstatus as a lost Targaryen prince remains unknown to him. Had he discovered his\n\u2018exceptional\u2019 qualities earlier (Harry Potter style), it\u2019s likely that his arc\nwould be that of a typical chosen one. But, what people seem to like about him,\nis that he has <i>earned </i>much of the\nrespect he now has. He was chosen by the people because of his words <i>and </i>actions. And hey, we love the story\nof an underdog. But then\u2026comes season seven.</p><p><b>Characters paralleled with Jon</b></p><p>Before we get to season seven stuff, I want to talk about characters often paralleled with Jon. The obvious character is Daenerys, and I talked about their parallels more in the Daenerys post. But also:</p><p>Sansa Stark: Jon\u2019s plot hit a lot of the same beats as Sansa\u2019s arc. They are both far away from home and isolated, they both have to survive in a place where they can\u2019t be honest (in King\u2019s Landing vs the wildlings) They have their lowest point at round abouts the same time. Season five ends with both of their futures/lives being uncertain (Jon got stabbed and Sansa jumped off a building).\u00a0 And then of course, when they came together in season six, they have both been on each other\u2019s team ever since, steadily growing as rulers. This is what a lot of Jonsas look to as important foreshadowing that they will eventually rule together as King and Queen.</p><p>Arya Stark: Jon and Arya were always the black sheep of the family and two of the closest siblings. Arya carries needle with her still so Jon gave her the first means to defend herself and was one of the few who took her seriously even as a child. There are more parallels between them in the book, but their reunion is one of the most built up things ever, so it will definetily make a splash in season 8. Also it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if one of them had to watch the other die because of their closeness.</p><p>Bran Stark: Jon and Bran are both the ones who have seen the Night King and are the ones most dedicated to stopping the Others. But Bran knows more than Jon. He saw Jon in season four while Jon was oblivious to him being there. Bran saw the Night King in visions and knew that something bad was coming long before Jon. And, now, Bran is the one who understands Jon\u2019s past. This foreshadows Bran being an important guide for Jon in season 8. He will be the one to reveal his true name.</p><p>Mance Rayder: Mance, like Jon, was chosen for leadership and Jon and he clearly had respect for each other as Jon eventually saves him from being burned to death. But season seven called an explicit parallel to Jon and Mance when Daenerys unknowingly quotes Jon in the cave:\u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t their survival more important than your pride?\u201d Mance, in his conversation, replies\u00a0\u201cFuck my pride\u201d because he knows its not about that. Jon, likewise, is not ruling the north for his pride. However this parallel with Mance is suggested as a reason he ultimately bends the knee.</p><p>Stannis: Stannis is the failed Azor Ahai where as Jon seems to, apparently, be the real Azor Ahai. Melisandre switches to believing in Jon after Stannis\u2019 death and ressurects him. And Davos now advises Jon instead of Stannis. There is a sense that Jon is the new and improved Stannis who is just but is more merciful. He is the true\u00a0\u2018prince that was promised\u2019. Daenerys could also be involved in this parallel.</p><p>Jaime: This is a much more subtle parallel because these two sort of run on opposite paths to each other. When Jaime and Jon meet (in a show-only scene), Jaime mocks Jon for his commitment to the Night\u2019s Watch. Jaime is bitter and over the world. Jon is naive and still believes the Night Watch to be full of heroes. Over the course of the show, Jaime has slowly regained his honor and vows have become important to him again, shown by him leaving Cersei to journey north and honor his pledge. Jon, on the other hand, has learned that the Night\u2019s Watch wasn\u2019t full of honor after all and that the world is a darker place. He even broke his own vows in season three. He is now more bitter about the world, but wiser. They seem to have met in the middle now. Jaime is not as awful and Jon is not as stupid. And they could become strong allies which is in direct conflict with their first meeting.</p><p>Ned and Robb: Of course, I briefly mentioned this already, but Jon seems to continuously follow in the footsteps of other Stark men. Both his father and brother were honorable and died. So did Jon though he, unlike them, gets a second chance.</p><p>Theon: Jon and Theon were both not quite Stark sons who wanted to be Stark sons and had a competitive relationship with Robb (and also each other) because of it. Theon made the wrong choice about his family (Greyjoy vs Stark) and Jon will soon face a choice of his own (Stark vs Targaryen) which will become clear in season eight.</p><p>Alright. Now that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way:</p><p><b>Season Seven Jon and\n\u201cthe Problem\u201d</b></p><p>So, fresh off of being raised to King in the North by his\npeople, Jon decides to bend the knee to Daenerys. Not instantly, of course. He\nputs up a fight about it for a while, not wanting to bend the knee to a woman\nhe barely knows. But eventually, after the wight hunt, he decides to put his\ntrust in Daenerys. He even goes so far as to tell Cersei about the alliance,\nalmost completely losing her help against the wights.</p><p>This was\u2026let\u2019s say\u2026a controversial decision.</p><p>In my investigation of Jon\u2019s tag on tumblr, this was by far\nthe thing people were most irritated about. Throwing away northern independence\nfor Daenerys did not sit well with some. And as far as I can tell, the reaction\nfell into three categories:</p><p><b>Number one: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is right and consistent with his character because he truly believes\nin Daenerys as a ruler and maybe it was a little dumb to tell Cersei about it,\nbut it was honorable and that is the Stark way.</b></p><p><b>Number 2: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is consistent with his character but that character should have gotten\nfucking smarter by now, like, come on Jon, can\u2019t you tell one single lie to\nCersei, and also your brother Robb did not work this hard for northern\nindependence so that you could throw it away at the drop of a hat you absolute\npiece of\u2013</b></p><p><b>And Number 3: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is not what it seems and he has secret political agenda behind bending\nthe knee to Daenerys and he is playing the game now just like everyone else,\nwhich marks substantial character growth from \u201cthe northern fool\u201d.</b></p><p>Just like the first time I am going to give all three of\nthese theories a fair shake from the perspective of those who believe in them.\nAnd, once again, none of these theories are without merit or precedence. I\u2019m\nnot covering theories that I think are totally contradicted by canon. I am also\nnot taking into account outside influences like the books or the actors\nopinions etc. I am going to try to make this a show only reading. Which one you\nagree with? Well that\u2019s up to you, but I hope we can once again all see each\nother\u2019s points of view and have a respectful discussion. Everyone was very nice\non the Daenerys post! So, without further ado:</p><p><b>Theory 1: Honest Jon</b></p><p>This theory takes Jon at his word on \u2018why he bent the knee\u2019,\nand it posits that his honesty and honor are his most prominent and important\ntraits. It\u2019s easy to see why. As I said earlier, Jon is perhaps the most\nstraight forward moral main character remaining to us. And he has always\nstriven to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. So when he says \u201cI am true to my\nword\u2026or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot\nserve two queens when I have already pledged myself to Daenerys of House\nTargaryen\u201d he is being honest. </p><p>It may seem like a stupid decision to be honest with Cersei,\nand that is indeed what got his father killed. But Jon acknowledges that fact\nwhen Tyrion demands an explanation: \u201cI\u2019m not going to swear an oath I can\u2019t\nuphold. Talk about my father if you want and tell me that\u2019s the attitude that\ngot him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning\nanything. Then there are no more answers and better and better lies. And lies\nwon\u2019t help us in this fight.\u201d</p><p>This seems to solidify Jon as our most \u201cmoral hero\u201d. When\neveryone else goes low, he goes high. Even though experience and everyone\naround him tells him to learn from his fathers mistakes and maybe stoop to\nplaying the game just once, he seems to prefer to honor Ned\u2019s memory by living\nas he did.</p><p>There is something honorable about this. The fact that Jon,\nwho died doing what he thought was right and got a rare second chance, still\nrefuses to play the game, makes him extraordinary in some way. And maybe it is\nwhat makes him fit to be a king. He really isn\u2019t too proud or too power hungry.\nHe does what he thinks is best for his people and in this particular theory, he\nthinks Daenerys is best for Westeros (we will talk about why in a bit). He\nwants to win this game a different way, which is a respectable notion. Many\npeople on this theory, it is fair to mention, support Jonerys, so this moment\nis also seen as a declaration of loyalty to his partner (which sweetens the\ndeal for the shippers).</p><p>Then, there\u2019s <b>Theory\n2: The Northern Fool, </b>which is held primarily by people who think Jon is an\nabsolute dumb ass. This is actually kind of a ship neutral theory? I\u2019ve seen\nJonerys, Jonsa and non-shippers all pass this theory around. That \u00a0Jon is stupid and, likewise, so are the\nwriters. </p><p>Because <i>sure </i>Jon,\nhonor and honesty is all fine and dandy, but it seems as if you\u2019ve been\npreaching a lot about \u2018the greater good\u2019. The greater good which is defeating\nthe white walkers. So maybe the world will forgive one single lie.</p><p>People in this group side with Tyrion and Daenerys in this\nscenario. Like, thank you Jon for your loyalty but maybe make sure that the\nsuicide squad mission is actually worth it and not a complete waste of time. Or\nsomething. Maybe if the past few episodes could actually have some payoff, that\nwould be rad. I love not having my time wasted.</p><p>Support for this theory tends to spill over onto critique\nfor the writers, which we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about later. Many viewers\nthink that Jon isn\u2019t meant to be as stupid as he comes across here. The\nwriters, it seems, are trying to get all viewers feel like the theory one\nsupporters, but their writing is kind of\u2026meh during this season? They don\u2019t\nmake an effective case, in this scene, for Jon\u2019s honesty. Because maybe they\u2019re\njust forgetting how to do character development. Lord knows they forgot about\nArya\u2019s character development this season, so why not?</p><p>People in this camp also tend to agree with Sansa\u2019s line in\nthe first episode of season 7: That Jon needs to be smarter than his father and\nRobb because they died. This line seems like explicit advice that Jon should\nhave taken and the fact that he didn\u2019t perhaps foreshadows a bleak end for him.\nBut, of course, we\u2019ll get more into Jon\u2019s ending later. Right now, we\u2019re just\ntalking about his shining moment in the dragon pit.</p><p>The long and short of this theory is thus: Jon is true to\ncharacter, perhaps, but it only emphasizes how little he has grown and that he\nis doomed to make the same mistakes as his father and brother. A northern fool,\nuntil the end.</p><p>In both these theories, Jon has bent the knee to Daenerys\nwith sincerity. So we need to take a quick break to talk about why before we\nmove onto the outsider theory. </p><p>Why does Jon believe in Daenerys? What prompts him to bend\nthe knee in the boat? According to most readings, it is Daenerys\u2019 change of\nheart. Throughout much of the season, Daenerys refuses to help Jon until he\nbends the knee. But in the boat, after seeing the true threat of the undead,\nshe believes him and vows to help him. No stipulations. No command for him to\nbend the knee. Believers of these theories put THIS as the moment. Because\nDaenerys is no longer demanding that he kneel, she is now acknowledging him as\nan equal and putting the people before her own pride (just like she told him to\ndo a few episodes previous). Because of her willingness to do this, and the\nfact that she came north to save them at great personal cost, he deems her\nworthy of being his queen.</p><p>Yes, he is supposedly giving up the north, but in his mind\nhe is putting it in good hands. And it isn\u2019t as if Jon is power hungry. He\ndoesn\u2019t really want power at all. He just wants to be sure that his people will\nbe safe and perhaps queen Daenerys and her dragons are the best way to ensure\nthat.</p><p>But then, there is a theory that posits that Jon\u2019s motives\nin season seven are not stupid at all, but rather they are a part of an\nintentional strategy. And this, of course, brings us to Political! Jon.</p><p><b>Theory 3: Political\nJon</b></p><p>This theory is going to take me a little bit longer to\nexplain. Because while theory one and two tend to take Jon\u2019s characterization\nat the surface level, this theory involves a lot of reading in between the\nlines. But first: a disclaimer. I think many people are under the impression\nthat all of those people who subscribe to Political Jon are Jonsas. This is\nlargely used to dismiss political Jon as being a delusion created in attempt to\nsupport a ship. But Political! Jon is by no means a theory exclusive to Jonsas\nand I wouldn\u2019t be covering it as a theory if I thought it was completely\ncontradicted by canon.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is: Most people\ngravitate toward Political! Jon NOT for the purpose of their favorite ship, but\nbecause of their love of Jon himself\u2013and their deep and abiding desire for him\nto not be completely stupid.</p><p>Subscribers of theory two believe that Jon is stupid but\nhave accepted that as an error of the writing. Political Jon believers think\nthat his supposed \u201cstupidity\u201d is highly intentional and actually his own way of\nplaying the game. So. Let\u2019s break it down.</p><p>In this theory, Jon does not truly have feelings for\nDaenerys, nor does he think she will be a good queen. However, he does not see\nher as someone to trifle with and he knows that he will need her help to defeat\nthe White walkers. He also sees her as stronger than Cersei and better than\nCersei, so when he is asked to swear neutrality in the dragon pit, he sides with\nDaenerys just to make SURE that Daenerys buys his loyalty. He thinks that\nDaenerys will easily beat Cersei in a fight anyway.</p><p>First: the lying thing. Can honest Jon bring himself to lie\nto Daenerys? Can he bring himself to deceive at all when he strives to be so\nlike his father, Eddard Stark? And is there any precedent for him lying for the\ngreater good?</p><p>Turns out: Yes. Let\u2019s take a gander at season 3, shall we?</p><p>In season 3, Jon is captured by a group of wildlings and is\ncommanded by his superior, the Half Hand, to do whatever he can to gather\ninformation about Mance\u2019s army. This is, after all, a matter of grave\nimportance. It\u2019s not just Jon\u2019s life that is on the line\u2013it\u2019s the lives of\neveryone beyond the wall if the wildlings get past.</p><p>So Jon kills the Halfhand and gains the trust of the\nwildlings. But he does more than that. He lies about the number of men at\nCastle Black, he lies about his motives and reasons for joining them, and he\neven breaks his vows by sleeping with a wildling woman. He has to keep up the\nact and does so pretty well, until he cannot bring himself to kill an innocent\nman south of the wall. Then he breaks and kills the wildling that was most\nsuspicious of him, proclaiming in a spiteful tone \u201cyou were right the whole\ntime\u201d.</p><p>Jon may not be one who lies easily, but he lies when it\ncounts. He is willing to lie for the greater good. So\u2026is it in character for\nhim to lie in season seven?</p><p>According to this theory, yes. Jon is concerned with one\nthing and one thing only: figure out a way to stop the White Walkers so he can\nprotect his people in the North. If the white walkers break through, the north\nwill be the first to suffer so he must make <i>absolutely\nsure </i>that doesn\u2019t happen. He goes south to Dragonstone to meet with Queen\nDaenerys because he has no other choice. She has the dragon glass they need <i>and </i>she could be a valuable ally in the\nfight.</p><p>However, in Jon\u2019s first meeting with her, he gets nowhere.\nHe is relatively honest in this meeting, pointing out that his people won\u2019t\nbend to a southern ruler and that he has no reason to bow to her because he\nbarely knows her. As a result of this conversation, he is ostensibly made a\nprisoner of the island. He can go where he wants but not to his ship. He can\u2019t\nhelp his people from the island so he needs to find out another way.</p><p>This is an important thing to note for people who don\u2019t know\nmuch about political Jon: Most of the believers of this theory are not saying\nthat Jon went to Dragonstone with the intent of being political. He did not hop\non a ship to \u2018go seduce the dragon queen\u2019. Of course not. Jon would only play\nthe manipulating game in the direst of circumstances. Rather, there is a point\nin season seven that, for many, marks Jon\u2019s shift from straight forward honesty\nto more subtle motivations. And it\u2019s his conversation with Tyrion.</p><p>Here, Jon realizes he has been \u2018a northern fool\u2019. He\nacknowledges it. He acknowledges that he should have listened to his men and to\nSansa when they said, \u2018don\u2019t go south\u2019. But this acknowledgement isn\u2019t worth\nmuch unless he switches tactics. If he just says \u2018I\u2019m stupid\u2019 but doesn\u2019t\nchange, then who cares? Now he has to actually listen to Sansa\u2019s advice. Be\nsmarter than father. Be smarter than Robb.</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t abandon honestly all together, of course. He\nstill wants to prove to Daenerys that the white walkers exist. He wants to\npersuade her to see his side because if she doesn\u2019t, his people will probably\nall die. As he tries to get a read on this queen, he realizes a couple of\nimportant things: One, when she is angry she tends to jump to dragons and needs\nto be advised not to set King\u2019s Landing on fire and two, she is very wrapped up\nin the idea of Targaryen exceptionalism. She hates the idea of being just like\neverybody else.</p><p>So he plays to this. When she asks him what she should do in\nresponse to a losing battles, he implies that using her dragons against\ninnocents WOULD make her just like everybody else. And she wants to be more\nthan that. With just this one line, he is able to convince her to not burn King\u2019s\nLanding. Clearly Jon is beginning to understand how Daenerys works.</p><p>But still, he understands she is dangerous. At some point,\nhe decides that if he wants to really protect his people, he is going to need\nto be sure she is on their side. So he bends the knee in the boat. This is at a\nhopeless moment for Jon, after he\u2019s faced the army of the dead and realized how\nmuch help they are going to need. He doesn\u2019t want to surrender his people to a\nsouthern ruler, but he also knows independence won\u2019t last forever. Eventually,\nshe\u2019ll want to bring the north into the fold, so better to do it peacefully and\nprotect everyone.</p><p>Eventually, he even gives himself over to her in the\nbedroom. This is a progression from what happened with Ygritte. Ygritte made\nher want of Jon known and then demanded he break his vows to prove his loyalty.\nSo he did, and in doing so, earned her devotion. This time, he sees that\nDaenerys is developing feelings for him. So he decides to take the initiative\nhimself and visit her on the boat, giving himself to her to secure her loyalty\nto the north. Many people pointed out that having sex with a woman out of\nmarriage is a little bit out of character for Jon who vowed never to sire a bastard\n(and in a world where sex outside of marriage, especially for women, is heavily\nscorned). Unless of course, he\u2019s giving into what she wants (just like Ygritte\ndid). Apparently there was also a deleted scene or moment in the script when\nDaenerys<i> asked</i> him to come to her\nroom? Whatever, that\u2019s not relevant to this interpretation because we\u2019re only\nfocusing on what we get from the screen.</p><p>Again, all of this is done without malice from Jon. I saw a\npost arguing that political Jon meant Dark! Jon because he was manipulating\nDaenerys feelings. I think in some interpretations this is true, but in others,\nit seems Jon isn\u2019t planning to \u2018break Daenerys\u2019 heart\u2019. He\u2019s entering into this\nsomewhat like a woman might enter into an arranged marriage in this time\u2013\u201cthis\nwill bring peace and she wants it, so fine. This is what\u2019s best for my people.\u201d</p><p>Many people believe that this is not Jon straight up\ntricking Daenerys with the plan of going \u2018just kidding! It was all a lie!\u2019\nlater on. It\u2019s Jon trying to secure the north. It\u2019s entirely likely that he\nplans to keep his word. But, just like with the wildlings, if Daenerys goes too\nfar or asks too much of Jon, he will break away. If it becomes clear that he\ncannot contain her \u2018fire and blood\u2019 impulses, he will abandon her and return to\nfighting for his people.</p><p>So the precedent for Political Jon is set by Jon\u2019s season\nthree journey, but a lot of the evidence is found in Kit\u2019s acting. Many have\nobserved that in a lot of scenes, Jon does not appear all too thrilled with\nDaenerys. In some, he even looks uncomfortable. In the view of believers of\nthis theory, this acting choice is intentional and made to alert us to the fact\nthat Daenerys cares for Jon more than he cares for her. Which, yes, maybe. That\u2019s\na perfectly valid reading but\u2026also\u2026Kit\u2019s acting is kind of\u2026wooden?</p><p>I mean it started out way more wooden and he\u2019s gotten better\nover time. But he\u2019s usually not one for a range of facial expressions. He does\nbetter depending on what actor he is working with. I think perhaps one of the\nreasons that Jonsa has become such a popular ship is that Kit has great\nchemistry on screen with Sophie Turner. He, likewise, had very good chemistry\nwith Rose. There are moments of good acting from Jon in season seven, but in a\nlot of scenes he just seems vaguely tired.</p><p>And this is the main debate to be had. Are all of these\nacting, writing and directing choices actually intentional? Or are they just errors?\nIt could just be that some of the dialogue was uninspired and Kit needed better\ndirection. Or it could be a very subtle build up. Regardless, we won\u2019t know for\nsure until we see season 8.</p><p><b>Jon\u2019s end:\nSacrificial Hero or King?</b></p><p>Putting aside the debate of whether or not Jon is political,\nwe need to talk about where he will end up. There are three possibilities for\nthis too (because three is a good number), and they actually quite mirror\nDaenerys\u2019 possibilities.</p><p><b>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>On the throne with Daenerys</b></p><p><b>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>A Sacrificial hero</b></p><p><b>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>On the throne without Daenerys (possibly\nwith Sansa)</b></p><p>So, first off, Jon and Daenerys could end up being the song\nof ice and fire together and the two Targaryens to bring about a restoration of\nthe Targaryen name, perhaps this time with less incest? (No sibling marriages\nguys. Please. A whole book just came out about why that fucked things up). It\nmakes sense on a symbolic level. The story begins with the Targaryens being\noutcasts and gone and could end with them once again being in power. Also, while\nDaenerys has been a contender for the throne since the very beginning, Jon has\nonly become a contender as recently as the end of season six, which means him\nending up on the throne would add an additional twist.</p><p>On the whole, both Targaryen heirs ending up on the throne\nand starting a new family does seem a little too happy and easy and perfect for\nGame of Thrones, so if this did happen, there would have to be collateral\ndamage of another sort. The deaths of other characters, perhaps the loss of\nwinterfell or even the destruction of the Red Keep itself. It\u2019s even likely\nthat if they rule together it will NOT be from the Iron Throne (because that\nthrone may very well get destroyed).</p><p>On the other hand, Jon could be a <b>sacrificial hero </b>and give his life in the battle to destroy the\nNight King. Now some might say: wait. Jon already died once. What would be the\npoint of just killing him off again? Well, this would actually play very well\ninto the heavy weight of death on this show. One of the major running themes of\ngame of thrones is \u2018Valar Morghulis\u2019. All men must die. If this is not the case\nand dead loved ones can be brought back without consequences, then death loses\na lot of weight. </p><p>There is a sense that perhaps Jon\u2019s return from the dead is\nonly temporary. He has come back to warn Westeros about the White Walkers,\nfight to save the realm and then die in the process. If this is the case, then\nit would put forth the message that no one can escape death. Sometimes, very\nrarely, you get a second chance. But that doesn\u2019t make you immortal. It is not\nJon\u2019s time yet but that time is coming soon. We see this foreshadowed with\nBerric Dondarian, who is a veteran at coming back. Now that Thoros of Myr is\ndead, his days are numbered as well. All of the dead will return to the ground\nbefore this series is over and Jon with them.</p><p>Or, perhaps not. In the third theory, Jon becomes king of\nthe Seven Kingdoms. Again, as he is a newer candidate for the throne, this is\nmore unexpected than Daenerys. Some who believe in this theory think that\nDaenerys will die as a hero and leave Jon alone to reluctantly carry on her\nlegacy. He\u2019s not a power hungry person and doesn\u2019t want the throne, but he\u2019s\nthe kind of character that keeps vows and does his duty. He will serve the\nrealm as its ruler even though his love is gone.</p><p>Or perhaps Daenerys is not his love. Perhaps, if the Dark\nDaenerys theory becomes real, he will be among those who help defeat her and\nthen become king of Westeros much the same way he became king of the North.\nBecause the people chose him. Those who subscribe to this theory often see him\nwith Sansa by his side as a wife (though that is not a requirement of this\ntheory). Whether he is romantically involved with Sansa or not, Jon will rely\nheavily on the Starks in this time as they are the ones who truly matter most\nto him.</p><p>And this brings us to the final question about Jon. <b>Stark or Targaryen?</b> Which of his sides\nwill he embrace or will he hold them both equally? I think for an answer to\nthis we have to go to Jon\u2019s scene with Theon in the Dragonstone throne room.\nThere are two important lines here. One is this: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to choose. You\u2019re\na Greyjoy and a Stark\u201d. This seems to be hinting that Jon himself will \u2018not\nchoose\u2019. He will also embrace being both a Stark and a Targaryen in equal\nparts. <i>However </i>there\u2019s another line\nas well: \u201cHe (Ned Stark) was more a father to you than your own father\u201d. And\nthis seems to suggest that yes, even though Jon was born a Targaryen, nurture\ntrumps nature in this case. Rhaegar may be his blood father but <i>Ned </i>is the one who raised Jon. So\nultimately, his Stark half will be more important to him.</p><p>This scene could be read both ways. There\u2019s no scenario\nwhere Jon abandons his Stark heritage. Whether you see Jon\u2019s relationship with\nSansa as romantic or not it is VERY clear that he cares deeply about her. He\nalso cares very deeply about Arya and Bran (who I know I haven\u2019t talked a lot\nabout here in this piece but they\u2019ll get their own post, promise). We just\nhaven\u2019t gotten the chance to see him interact with them yet. He only just found\nout they were alive, after all. But there\u2019s no scenario where Jon turns his\nback on his family. But whether or not he chooses the Starks over the\nTargaryens or balances the two remains to be seen. </p><p>That\u2019s it for this read on Jon. Again, keep the comments\nrespectful and the discussion understanding. It\u2019s okay that people have\ndifferent perspectives than you! I obviously have a reading that I think is\nmost likely but I\u2019m not telling any of you here, lol.</p><p> Next time I\u2019m going\nto tackle Sansa and the many possible readings of her character. Happy\nThronesing everyone!</p>",

This is a very different sort of reading from the Daenerys one (which is <a href=\"http://kallypsowrites.tumblr.com/post/180456877410/the-many-readings-of-game-of-thrones-part-1\">here</a>): mostly\nbecause no one is arguing that Jon is an antagonist. Or if they are, I sure\nhaven\u2019t seen it anywhere. This is perhaps because Jon is our most\nstraightforward hero left. He\u2019s the guy with the sword. The man with the easiest\nto plot hero\u2019s journey. He has gone from a bastard of Winterfell to the King in\nthe North. And over all? People really like Jon.<br></p><p>The main friction in the fandom seems to be Jonerys vs Jonsa\nright now but both of those groups? They love the heck out of Jon. And honestly\nI don\u2019t think Jon gets a whole lot of hate. At most he gets\u2026neutral shrugs\nfrom the part of the fandom that just doesn\u2019t care that much about him. He also\ngets accused of being too cookie cutter as a hero sometimes. \u00a0I think the most controversial thing he did\nwas bend the knee in season seven and we\u2019re going to cover the interpretations\nof why he did that\u2026later.</p><p>In fact this is going to be structured differently from the\nDaenerys reading. Because while my different readings of Daenerys start at the\nvery beginning of her journey, Jon\u2019s readings don\u2019t diverge until\u2026later. Up\nuntil season six, in fact, the fandom has a pretty united opinion about him and\nit\u2019s really not until season seven that the conflict really starts. So first,\nlet\u2019s start with what everyone can agree on: Who is Jon Snow? More under the cut</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>Jon Snow: From\nBastard to Reluctant Ruler</b></p><p>Jon Snow begins Game of Thrones as a Bastard of Winterfell\nwith no claim to any lands or titles or even his family name. But still, he is\nwell loved by his family, which was uncommon treatment for bastards at the\ntime. He is not content with his life and longs to join the wall instead to\nescape the fact that he is not a true Stark. He, like many of the other\ncharacters, has rather na\u00efve ideas about the world and about honor. It is only\nafter joining the Wall that he realizes the truth of things. The Night\u2019s Watch\nis not as grand an honor as he first expected and nor are the wildlings an evil\nmob trying to break past the wall to destroy Westeros.</p><p>Jon\u2019s journey is the most typical \u2018hero\u2019s journey\u2019 in the\nwhole series, and he truly grows from a boy to a man over the seasons. He learns\nto shift his black and white view and challenge the preconceived norms. He\ninfiltrates the wildlings, proves his mettle in battle and is eventually\nelected as the Lord Commander because of his bravery. But, when he realizes the\ntrue threat to the north (the white walkers) he begins to make controversial\ndecisions that eventually lead to his death.</p><p>Until season five, Jon Snow\u2019s journey is typical to that of\nNed and Robb Stark. All three are good leaders and respected by those who\nfollow them. But all three make awful mistakes and do not account for the\ntreachery of men. And for that, they are all killed. Ned believes Littlefinger\nand thinks it is a good idea to warn Cersei, Robb attends a wedding at the\nTwins thinking guest rite will keep him safe, and Jon never thinks that his own\nmen would break their vows by killing him after he lets the wildlings past the\nwall.</p><p>But unlike Ned and Robb, Jon is returned to life.</p><p>This seems to suggest Jon has a higher calling: a calling to\nwarn the world about the Others. This is also the moment when he begins to\nbecome \u2018exceptional\u2019. Whereas before he was a mere bastard with no claims who\nlived and died by his deeds alone, now the writers begin to upturn everything\nwe thought we knew about Jon. First, he breaks the \u2018death is final\u2019 rule that\nmost of the characters are bound by. Then he leaves the Night\u2019s Watch because,\nwell, he died, so that\u2019s a nice loop hole. He helps take back Winterfell and,\ndespite thinking he would never, ever have any claim there, he is named King in\nthe North. And NOW we know that he is a Targaryen: the son of Rhaegar and\nLyanna (though most of the characters are currently unaware of this).</p><p>Jon has a very typical hero\u2019s journey in this way. Just an\nordinary guy, living his life with no designs on power. Then as time goes on it\nturns out he actually IS exceptional and may just be destined to save the whole\nworld. It\u2019s typical and, on paper, juuuust a little bit boring. Like I said at\nthe beginning, he\u2019s a bit of a cookie cutter hero. His arc is well executed but\nwe\u2019ve seen his story before. I think the major thing in Jon\u2019s favor is that his\nexceptionalism does not come into play until way far down his arc. And his\nstatus as a lost Targaryen prince remains unknown to him. Had he discovered his\n\u2018exceptional\u2019 qualities earlier (Harry Potter style), it\u2019s likely that his arc\nwould be that of a typical chosen one. But, what people seem to like about him,\nis that he has <i>earned </i>much of the\nrespect he now has. He was chosen by the people because of his words <i>and </i>actions. And hey, we love the story\nof an underdog. But then\u2026comes season seven.</p><p><b>Characters paralleled with Jon</b></p><p>Before we get to season seven stuff, I want to talk about characters often paralleled with Jon. The obvious character is Daenerys, and I talked about their parallels more in the Daenerys post. But also:</p><p>Sansa Stark: Jon\u2019s plot hit a lot of the same beats as Sansa\u2019s arc. They are both far away from home and isolated, they both have to survive in a place where they can\u2019t be honest (in King\u2019s Landing vs the wildlings) They have their lowest point at round abouts the same time. Season five ends with both of their futures/lives being uncertain (Jon got stabbed and Sansa jumped off a building).\u00a0 And then of course, when they came together in season six, they have both been on each other\u2019s team ever since, steadily growing as rulers. This is what a lot of Jonsas look to as important foreshadowing that they will eventually rule together as King and Queen.</p><p>Arya Stark: Jon and Arya were always the black sheep of the family and two of the closest siblings. Arya carries needle with her still so Jon gave her the first means to defend herself and was one of the few who took her seriously even as a child. There are more parallels between them in the book, but their reunion is one of the most built up things ever, so it will definetily make a splash in season 8. Also it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if one of them had to watch the other die because of their closeness.</p><p>Bran Stark: Jon and Bran are both the ones who have seen the Night King and are the ones most dedicated to stopping the Others. But Bran knows more than Jon. He saw Jon in season four while Jon was oblivious to him being there. Bran saw the Night King in visions and knew that something bad was coming long before Jon. And, now, Bran is the one who understands Jon\u2019s past. This foreshadows Bran being an important guide for Jon in season 8. He will be the one to reveal his true name.</p><p>Mance Rayder: Mance, like Jon, was chosen for leadership and Jon and he clearly had respect for each other as Jon eventually saves him from being burned to death. But season seven called an explicit parallel to Jon and Mance when Daenerys unknowingly quotes Jon in the cave:\u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t their survival more important than your pride?\u201d Mance, in his conversation, replies\u00a0\u201cFuck my pride\u201d because he knows its not about that. Jon, likewise, is not ruling the north for his pride. However this parallel with Mance is suggested as a reason he ultimately bends the knee.</p><p>Stannis: Stannis is the failed Azor Ahai where as Jon seems to, apparently, be the real Azor Ahai. Melisandre switches to believing in Jon after Stannis\u2019 death and ressurects him. And Davos now advises Jon instead of Stannis. There is a sense that Jon is the new and improved Stannis who is just but is more merciful. He is the true\u00a0\u2018prince that was promised\u2019. Daenerys could also be involved in this parallel.</p><p>Jaime: This is a much more subtle parallel because these two sort of run on opposite paths to each other. When Jaime and Jon meet (in a show-only scene), Jaime mocks Jon for his commitment to the Night\u2019s Watch. Jaime is bitter and over the world. Jon is naive and still believes the Night Watch to be full of heroes. Over the course of the show, Jaime has slowly regained his honor and vows have become important to him again, shown by him leaving Cersei to journey north and honor his pledge. Jon, on the other hand, has learned that the Night\u2019s Watch wasn\u2019t full of honor after all and that the world is a darker place. He even broke his own vows in season three. He is now more bitter about the world, but wiser. They seem to have met in the middle now. Jaime is not as awful and Jon is not as stupid. And they could become strong allies which is in direct conflict with their first meeting.</p><p>Ned and Robb: Of course, I briefly mentioned this already, but Jon seems to continuously follow in the footsteps of other Stark men. Both his father and brother were honorable and died. So did Jon though he, unlike them, gets a second chance.</p><p>Theon: Jon and Theon were both not quite Stark sons who wanted to be Stark sons and had a competitive relationship with Robb (and also each other) because of it. Theon made the wrong choice about his family (Greyjoy vs Stark) and Jon will soon face a choice of his own (Stark vs Targaryen) which will become clear in season eight.</p><p>Alright. Now that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way:</p><p><b>Season Seven Jon and\n\u201cthe Problem\u201d</b></p><p>So, fresh off of being raised to King in the North by his\npeople, Jon decides to bend the knee to Daenerys. Not instantly, of course. He\nputs up a fight about it for a while, not wanting to bend the knee to a woman\nhe barely knows. But eventually, after the wight hunt, he decides to put his\ntrust in Daenerys. He even goes so far as to tell Cersei about the alliance,\nalmost completely losing her help against the wights.</p><p>This was\u2026let\u2019s say\u2026a controversial decision.</p><p>In my investigation of Jon\u2019s tag on tumblr, this was by far\nthe thing people were most irritated about. Throwing away northern independence\nfor Daenerys did not sit well with some. And as far as I can tell, the reaction\nfell into three categories:</p><p><b>Number one: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is right and consistent with his character because he truly believes\nin Daenerys as a ruler and maybe it was a little dumb to tell Cersei about it,\nbut it was honorable and that is the Stark way.</b></p><p><b>Number 2: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is consistent with his character but that character should have gotten\nfucking smarter by now, like, come on Jon, can\u2019t you tell one single lie to\nCersei, and also your brother Robb did not work this hard for northern\nindependence so that you could throw it away at the drop of a hat you absolute\npiece of\u2013</b></p><p><b>And Number 3: Jon\u2019s\ndecision is not what it seems and he has secret political agenda behind bending\nthe knee to Daenerys and he is playing the game now just like everyone else,\nwhich marks substantial character growth from \u201cthe northern fool\u201d.</b></p><p>Just like the first time I am going to give all three of\nthese theories a fair shake from the perspective of those who believe in them.\nAnd, once again, none of these theories are without merit or precedence. I\u2019m\nnot covering theories that I think are totally contradicted by canon. I am also\nnot taking into account outside influences like the books or the actors\nopinions etc. I am going to try to make this a show only reading. Which one you\nagree with? Well that\u2019s up to you, but I hope we can once again all see each\nother\u2019s points of view and have a respectful discussion. Everyone was very nice\non the Daenerys post! So, without further ado:</p><p><b>Theory 1: Honest Jon</b></p><p>This theory takes Jon at his word on \u2018why he bent the knee\u2019,\nand it posits that his honesty and honor are his most prominent and important\ntraits. It\u2019s easy to see why. As I said earlier, Jon is perhaps the most\nstraight forward moral main character remaining to us. And he has always\nstriven to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. So when he says \u201cI am true to my\nword\u2026or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot\nserve two queens when I have already pledged myself to Daenerys of House\nTargaryen\u201d he is being honest. </p><p>It may seem like a stupid decision to be honest with Cersei,\nand that is indeed what got his father killed. But Jon acknowledges that fact\nwhen Tyrion demands an explanation: \u201cI\u2019m not going to swear an oath I can\u2019t\nuphold. Talk about my father if you want and tell me that\u2019s the attitude that\ngot him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning\nanything. Then there are no more answers and better and better lies. And lies\nwon\u2019t help us in this fight.\u201d</p><p>This seems to solidify Jon as our most \u201cmoral hero\u201d. When\neveryone else goes low, he goes high. Even though experience and everyone\naround him tells him to learn from his fathers mistakes and maybe stoop to\nplaying the game just once, he seems to prefer to honor Ned\u2019s memory by living\nas he did.</p><p>There is something honorable about this. The fact that Jon,\nwho died doing what he thought was right and got a rare second chance, still\nrefuses to play the game, makes him extraordinary in some way. And maybe it is\nwhat makes him fit to be a king. He really isn\u2019t too proud or too power hungry.\nHe does what he thinks is best for his people and in this particular theory, he\nthinks Daenerys is best for Westeros (we will talk about why in a bit). He\nwants to win this game a different way, which is a respectable notion. Many\npeople on this theory, it is fair to mention, support Jonerys, so this moment\nis also seen as a declaration of loyalty to his partner (which sweetens the\ndeal for the shippers).</p><p>Then, there\u2019s <b>Theory\n2: The Northern Fool, </b>which is held primarily by people who think Jon is an\nabsolute dumb ass. This is actually kind of a ship neutral theory? I\u2019ve seen\nJonerys, Jonsa and non-shippers all pass this theory around. That \u00a0Jon is stupid and, likewise, so are the\nwriters. </p><p>Because <i>sure </i>Jon,\nhonor and honesty is all fine and dandy, but it seems as if you\u2019ve been\npreaching a lot about \u2018the greater good\u2019. The greater good which is defeating\nthe white walkers. So maybe the world will forgive one single lie.</p><p>People in this group side with Tyrion and Daenerys in this\nscenario. Like, thank you Jon for your loyalty but maybe make sure that the\nsuicide squad mission is actually worth it and not a complete waste of time. Or\nsomething. Maybe if the past few episodes could actually have some payoff, that\nwould be rad. I love not having my time wasted.</p><p>Support for this theory tends to spill over onto critique\nfor the writers, which we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about later. Many viewers\nthink that Jon isn\u2019t meant to be as stupid as he comes across here. The\nwriters, it seems, are trying to get all viewers feel like the theory one\nsupporters, but their writing is kind of\u2026meh during this season? They don\u2019t\nmake an effective case, in this scene, for Jon\u2019s honesty. Because maybe they\u2019re\njust forgetting how to do character development. Lord knows they forgot about\nArya\u2019s character development this season, so why not?</p><p>People in this camp also tend to agree with Sansa\u2019s line in\nthe first episode of season 7: That Jon needs to be smarter than his father and\nRobb because they died. This line seems like explicit advice that Jon should\nhave taken and the fact that he didn\u2019t perhaps foreshadows a bleak end for him.\nBut, of course, we\u2019ll get more into Jon\u2019s ending later. Right now, we\u2019re just\ntalking about his shining moment in the dragon pit.</p><p>The long and short of this theory is thus: Jon is true to\ncharacter, perhaps, but it only emphasizes how little he has grown and that he\nis doomed to make the same mistakes as his father and brother. A northern fool,\nuntil the end.</p><p>In both these theories, Jon has bent the knee to Daenerys\nwith sincerity. So we need to take a quick break to talk about why before we\nmove onto the outsider theory. </p><p>Why does Jon believe in Daenerys? What prompts him to bend\nthe knee in the boat? According to most readings, it is Daenerys\u2019 change of\nheart. Throughout much of the season, Daenerys refuses to help Jon until he\nbends the knee. But in the boat, after seeing the true threat of the undead,\nshe believes him and vows to help him. No stipulations. No command for him to\nbend the knee. Believers of these theories put THIS as the moment. Because\nDaenerys is no longer demanding that he kneel, she is now acknowledging him as\nan equal and putting the people before her own pride (just like she told him to\ndo a few episodes previous). Because of her willingness to do this, and the\nfact that she came north to save them at great personal cost, he deems her\nworthy of being his queen.</p><p>Yes, he is supposedly giving up the north, but in his mind\nhe is putting it in good hands. And it isn\u2019t as if Jon is power hungry. He\ndoesn\u2019t really want power at all. He just wants to be sure that his people will\nbe safe and perhaps queen Daenerys and her dragons are the best way to ensure\nthat.</p><p>But then, there is a theory that posits that Jon\u2019s motives\nin season seven are not stupid at all, but rather they are a part of an\nintentional strategy. And this, of course, brings us to Political! Jon.</p><p><b>Theory 3: Political\nJon</b></p><p>This theory is going to take me a little bit longer to\nexplain. Because while theory one and two tend to take Jon\u2019s characterization\nat the surface level, this theory involves a lot of reading in between the\nlines. But first: a disclaimer. I think many people are under the impression\nthat all of those people who subscribe to Political Jon are Jonsas. This is\nlargely used to dismiss political Jon as being a delusion created in attempt to\nsupport a ship. But Political! Jon is by no means a theory exclusive to Jonsas\nand I wouldn\u2019t be covering it as a theory if I thought it was completely\ncontradicted by canon.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is: Most people\ngravitate toward Political! Jon NOT for the purpose of their favorite ship, but\nbecause of their love of Jon himself\u2013and their deep and abiding desire for him\nto not be completely stupid.</p><p>Subscribers of theory two believe that Jon is stupid but\nhave accepted that as an error of the writing. Political Jon believers think\nthat his supposed \u201cstupidity\u201d is highly intentional and actually his own way of\nplaying the game. So. Let\u2019s break it down.</p><p>In this theory, Jon does not truly have feelings for\nDaenerys, nor does he think she will be a good queen. However, he does not see\nher as someone to trifle with and he knows that he will need her help to defeat\nthe White walkers. He also sees her as stronger than Cersei and better than\nCersei, so when he is asked to swear neutrality in the dragon pit, he sides with\nDaenerys just to make SURE that Daenerys buys his loyalty. He thinks that\nDaenerys will easily beat Cersei in a fight anyway.</p><p>First: the lying thing. Can honest Jon bring himself to lie\nto Daenerys? Can he bring himself to deceive at all when he strives to be so\nlike his father, Eddard Stark? And is there any precedent for him lying for the\ngreater good?</p><p>Turns out: Yes. Let\u2019s take a gander at season 3, shall we?</p><p>In season 3, Jon is captured by a group of wildlings and is\ncommanded by his superior, the Half Hand, to do whatever he can to gather\ninformation about Mance\u2019s army. This is, after all, a matter of grave\nimportance. It\u2019s not just Jon\u2019s life that is on the line\u2013it\u2019s the lives of\neveryone beyond the wall if the wildlings get past.</p><p>So Jon kills the Halfhand and gains the trust of the\nwildlings. But he does more than that. He lies about the number of men at\nCastle Black, he lies about his motives and reasons for joining them, and he\neven breaks his vows by sleeping with a wildling woman. He has to keep up the\nact and does so pretty well, until he cannot bring himself to kill an innocent\nman south of the wall. Then he breaks and kills the wildling that was most\nsuspicious of him, proclaiming in a spiteful tone \u201cyou were right the whole\ntime\u201d.</p><p>Jon may not be one who lies easily, but he lies when it\ncounts. He is willing to lie for the greater good. So\u2026is it in character for\nhim to lie in season seven?</p><p>According to this theory, yes. Jon is concerned with one\nthing and one thing only: figure out a way to stop the White Walkers so he can\nprotect his people in the North. If the white walkers break through, the north\nwill be the first to suffer so he must make <i>absolutely\nsure </i>that doesn\u2019t happen. He goes south to Dragonstone to meet with Queen\nDaenerys because he has no other choice. She has the dragon glass they need <i>and </i>she could be a valuable ally in the\nfight.</p><p>However, in Jon\u2019s first meeting with her, he gets nowhere.\nHe is relatively honest in this meeting, pointing out that his people won\u2019t\nbend to a southern ruler and that he has no reason to bow to her because he\nbarely knows her. As a result of this conversation, he is ostensibly made a\nprisoner of the island. He can go where he wants but not to his ship. He can\u2019t\nhelp his people from the island so he needs to find out another way.</p><p>This is an important thing to note for people who don\u2019t know\nmuch about political Jon: Most of the believers of this theory are not saying\nthat Jon went to Dragonstone with the intent of being political. He did not hop\non a ship to \u2018go seduce the dragon queen\u2019. Of course not. Jon would only play\nthe manipulating game in the direst of circumstances. Rather, there is a point\nin season seven that, for many, marks Jon\u2019s shift from straight forward honesty\nto more subtle motivations. And it\u2019s his conversation with Tyrion.</p><p>Here, Jon realizes he has been \u2018a northern fool\u2019. He\nacknowledges it. He acknowledges that he should have listened to his men and to\nSansa when they said, \u2018don\u2019t go south\u2019. But this acknowledgement isn\u2019t worth\nmuch unless he switches tactics. If he just says \u2018I\u2019m stupid\u2019 but doesn\u2019t\nchange, then who cares? Now he has to actually listen to Sansa\u2019s advice. Be\nsmarter than father. Be smarter than Robb.</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t abandon honestly all together, of course. He\nstill wants to prove to Daenerys that the white walkers exist. He wants to\npersuade her to see his side because if she doesn\u2019t, his people will probably\nall die. As he tries to get a read on this queen, he realizes a couple of\nimportant things: One, when she is angry she tends to jump to dragons and needs\nto be advised not to set King\u2019s Landing on fire and two, she is very wrapped up\nin the idea of Targaryen exceptionalism. She hates the idea of being just like\neverybody else.</p><p>So he plays to this. When she asks him what she should do in\nresponse to a losing battles, he implies that using her dragons against\ninnocents WOULD make her just like everybody else. And she wants to be more\nthan that. With just this one line, he is able to convince her to not burn King\u2019s\nLanding. Clearly Jon is beginning to understand how Daenerys works.</p><p>But still, he understands she is dangerous. At some point,\nhe decides that if he wants to really protect his people, he is going to need\nto be sure she is on their side. So he bends the knee in the boat. This is at a\nhopeless moment for Jon, after he\u2019s faced the army of the dead and realized how\nmuch help they are going to need. He doesn\u2019t want to surrender his people to a\nsouthern ruler, but he also knows independence won\u2019t last forever. Eventually,\nshe\u2019ll want to bring the north into the fold, so better to do it peacefully and\nprotect everyone.</p><p>Eventually, he even gives himself over to her in the\nbedroom. This is a progression from what happened with Ygritte. Ygritte made\nher want of Jon known and then demanded he break his vows to prove his loyalty.\nSo he did, and in doing so, earned her devotion. This time, he sees that\nDaenerys is developing feelings for him. So he decides to take the initiative\nhimself and visit her on the boat, giving himself to her to secure her loyalty\nto the north. Many people pointed out that having sex with a woman out of\nmarriage is a little bit out of character for Jon who vowed never to sire a bastard\n(and in a world where sex outside of marriage, especially for women, is heavily\nscorned). Unless of course, he\u2019s giving into what she wants (just like Ygritte\ndid). Apparently there was also a deleted scene or moment in the script when\nDaenerys<i> asked</i> him to come to her\nroom? Whatever, that\u2019s not relevant to this interpretation because we\u2019re only\nfocusing on what we get from the screen.</p><p>Again, all of this is done without malice from Jon. I saw a\npost arguing that political Jon meant Dark! Jon because he was manipulating\nDaenerys feelings. I think in some interpretations this is true, but in others,\nit seems Jon isn\u2019t planning to \u2018break Daenerys\u2019 heart\u2019. He\u2019s entering into this\nsomewhat like a woman might enter into an arranged marriage in this time\u2013\u201cthis\nwill bring peace and she wants it, so fine. This is what\u2019s best for my people.\u201d</p><p>Many people believe that this is not Jon straight up\ntricking Daenerys with the plan of going \u2018just kidding! It was all a lie!\u2019\nlater on. It\u2019s Jon trying to secure the north. It\u2019s entirely likely that he\nplans to keep his word. But, just like with the wildlings, if Daenerys goes too\nfar or asks too much of Jon, he will break away. If it becomes clear that he\ncannot contain her \u2018fire and blood\u2019 impulses, he will abandon her and return to\nfighting for his people.</p><p>So the precedent for Political Jon is set by Jon\u2019s season\nthree journey, but a lot of the evidence is found in Kit\u2019s acting. Many have\nobserved that in a lot of scenes, Jon does not appear all too thrilled with\nDaenerys. In some, he even looks uncomfortable. In the view of believers of\nthis theory, this acting choice is intentional and made to alert us to the fact\nthat Daenerys cares for Jon more than he cares for her. Which, yes, maybe. That\u2019s\na perfectly valid reading but\u2026also\u2026Kit\u2019s acting is kind of\u2026wooden?</p><p>I mean it started out way more wooden and he\u2019s gotten better\nover time. But he\u2019s usually not one for a range of facial expressions. He does\nbetter depending on what actor he is working with. I think perhaps one of the\nreasons that Jonsa has become such a popular ship is that Kit has great\nchemistry on screen with Sophie Turner. He, likewise, had very good chemistry\nwith Rose. There are moments of good acting from Jon in season seven, but in a\nlot of scenes he just seems vaguely tired.</p><p>And this is the main debate to be had. Are all of these\nacting, writing and directing choices actually intentional? Or are they just errors?\nIt could just be that some of the dialogue was uninspired and Kit needed better\ndirection. Or it could be a very subtle build up. Regardless, we won\u2019t know for\nsure until we see season 8.</p><p><b>Jon\u2019s end:\nSacrificial Hero or King?</b></p><p>Putting aside the debate of whether or not Jon is political,\nwe need to talk about where he will end up. There are three possibilities for\nthis too (because three is a good number), and they actually quite mirror\nDaenerys\u2019 possibilities.</p><p><b>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>On the throne with Daenerys</b></p><p><b>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>A Sacrificial hero</b></p><p><b>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>On the throne without Daenerys (possibly\nwith Sansa)</b></p><p>So, first off, Jon and Daenerys could end up being the song\nof ice and fire together and the two Targaryens to bring about a restoration of\nthe Targaryen name, perhaps this time with less incest? (No sibling marriages\nguys. Please. A whole book just came out about why that fucked things up). It\nmakes sense on a symbolic level. The story begins with the Targaryens being\noutcasts and gone and could end with them once again being in power. Also, while\nDaenerys has been a contender for the throne since the very beginning, Jon has\nonly become a contender as recently as the end of season six, which means him\nending up on the throne would add an additional twist.</p><p>On the whole, both Targaryen heirs ending up on the throne\nand starting a new family does seem a little too happy and easy and perfect for\nGame of Thrones, so if this did happen, there would have to be collateral\ndamage of another sort. The deaths of other characters, perhaps the loss of\nwinterfell or even the destruction of the Red Keep itself. It\u2019s even likely\nthat if they rule together it will NOT be from the Iron Throne (because that\nthrone may very well get destroyed).</p><p>On the other hand, Jon could be a <b>sacrificial hero </b>and give his life in the battle to destroy the\nNight King. Now some might say: wait. Jon already died once. What would be the\npoint of just killing him off again? Well, this would actually play very well\ninto the heavy weight of death on this show. One of the major running themes of\ngame of thrones is \u2018Valar Morghulis\u2019. All men must die. If this is not the case\nand dead loved ones can be brought back without consequences, then death loses\na lot of weight. </p><p>There is a sense that perhaps Jon\u2019s return from the dead is\nonly temporary. He has come back to warn Westeros about the White Walkers,\nfight to save the realm and then die in the process. If this is the case, then\nit would put forth the message that no one can escape death. Sometimes, very\nrarely, you get a second chance. But that doesn\u2019t make you immortal. It is not\nJon\u2019s time yet but that time is coming soon. We see this foreshadowed with\nBerric Dondarian, who is a veteran at coming back. Now that Thoros of Myr is\ndead, his days are numbered as well. All of the dead will return to the ground\nbefore this series is over and Jon with them.</p><p>Or, perhaps not. In the third theory, Jon becomes king of\nthe Seven Kingdoms. Again, as he is a newer candidate for the throne, this is\nmore unexpected than Daenerys. Some who believe in this theory think that\nDaenerys will die as a hero and leave Jon alone to reluctantly carry on her\nlegacy. He\u2019s not a power hungry person and doesn\u2019t want the throne, but he\u2019s\nthe kind of character that keeps vows and does his duty. He will serve the\nrealm as its ruler even though his love is gone.</p><p>Or perhaps Daenerys is not his love. Perhaps, if the Dark\nDaenerys theory becomes real, he will be among those who help defeat her and\nthen become king of Westeros much the same way he became king of the North.\nBecause the people chose him. Those who subscribe to this theory often see him\nwith Sansa by his side as a wife (though that is not a requirement of this\ntheory). Whether he is romantically involved with Sansa or not, Jon will rely\nheavily on the Starks in this time as they are the ones who truly matter most\nto him.</p><p>And this brings us to the final question about Jon. <b>Stark or Targaryen?</b> Which of his sides\nwill he embrace or will he hold them both equally? I think for an answer to\nthis we have to go to Jon\u2019s scene with Theon in the Dragonstone throne room.\nThere are two important lines here. One is this: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to choose. You\u2019re\na Greyjoy and a Stark\u201d. This seems to be hinting that Jon himself will \u2018not\nchoose\u2019. He will also embrace being both a Stark and a Targaryen in equal\nparts. <i>However </i>there\u2019s another line\nas well: \u201cHe (Ned Stark) was more a father to you than your own father\u201d. And\nthis seems to suggest that yes, even though Jon was born a Targaryen, nurture\ntrumps nature in this case. Rhaegar may be his blood father but <i>Ned </i>is the one who raised Jon. So\nultimately, his Stark half will be more important to him.</p><p>This scene could be read both ways. There\u2019s no scenario\nwhere Jon abandons his Stark heritage. Whether you see Jon\u2019s relationship with\nSansa as romantic or not it is VERY clear that he cares deeply about her. He\nalso cares very deeply about Arya and Bran (who I know I haven\u2019t talked a lot\nabout here in this piece but they\u2019ll get their own post, promise). We just\nhaven\u2019t gotten the chance to see him interact with them yet. He only just found\nout they were alive, after all. But there\u2019s no scenario where Jon turns his\nback on his family. But whether or not he chooses the Starks over the\nTargaryens or balances the two remains to be seen. </p><p>That\u2019s it for this read on Jon. Again, keep the comments\nrespectful and the discussion understanding. It\u2019s okay that people have\ndifferent perspectives than you! I obviously have a reading that I think is\nmost likely but I\u2019m not telling any of you here, lol.</p><p> Next time I\u2019m going\nto tackle Sansa and the many possible readings of her character. Happy\nThronesing everyone!</p>",
                "content": "<p>Time to do some more parallel readings, this time with Jon\nSnow. This is a very different sort of reading from the Daenerys one (which is <a href=\"http://kallypsowrites.tumblr.com/post/180456877410/the-many-readings-of-game-of-thrones-part-1\">here</a>): mostly\nbecause no one is arguing that Jon is an antagonist. Or if they are, I sure\nhaven&rsquo;t seen it anywhere. This is perhaps because Jon is our most\nstraightforward hero left. He&rsquo;s the guy with the sword. The man with the easiest\nto plot hero&rsquo;s journey. He has gone from a bastard of Winterfell to the King in\nthe North. And over all? People really like Jon.<br /></p><p>The main friction in the fandom seems to be Jonerys vs Jonsa\nright now but both of those groups? They love the heck out of Jon. And honestly\nI don&rsquo;t think Jon gets a whole lot of hate. At most he gets&hellip;neutral shrugs\nfrom the part of the fandom that just doesn&rsquo;t care that much about him. He also\ngets accused of being too cookie cutter as a hero sometimes. &nbsp;I think the most controversial thing he did\nwas bend the knee in season seven and we&rsquo;re going to cover the interpretations\nof why he did that&hellip;later.</p><p>In fact this is going to be structured differently from the\nDaenerys reading. Because while my different readings of Daenerys start at the\nvery beginning of her journey, Jon&rsquo;s readings don&rsquo;t diverge until&hellip;later. Up\nuntil season six, in fact, the fandom has a pretty united opinion about him and\nit&rsquo;s really not until season seven that the conflict really starts. So first,\nlet&rsquo;s start with what everyone can agree on: Who is Jon Snow? More under the cut</p><p><b>Jon Snow: From\nBastard to Reluctant Ruler</b></p><p>Jon Snow begins Game of Thrones as a Bastard of Winterfell\nwith no claim to any lands or titles or even his family name. But still, he is\nwell loved by his family, which was uncommon treatment for bastards at the\ntime. He is not content with his life and longs to join the wall instead to\nescape the fact that he is not a true Stark. He, like many of the other\ncharacters, has rather na&iuml;ve ideas about the world and about honor. It is only\nafter joining the Wall that he realizes the truth of things. The Night&rsquo;s Watch\nis not as grand an honor as he first expected and nor are the wildlings an evil\nmob trying to break past the wall to destroy Westeros.</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s journey is the most typical &lsquo;hero&rsquo;s journey&rsquo; in the\nwhole series, and he truly grows from a boy to a man over the seasons. He learns\nto shift his black and white view and challenge the preconceived norms. He\ninfiltrates the wildlings, proves his mettle in battle and is eventually\nelected as the Lord Commander because of his bravery. But, when he realizes the\ntrue threat to the north (the white walkers) he begins to make controversial\ndecisions that eventually lead to his death.</p><p>Until season five, Jon Snow&rsquo;s journey is typical to that of\nNed and Robb Stark. All three are good leaders and respected by those who\nfollow them. But all three make awful mistakes and do not account for the\ntreachery of men. And for that, they are all killed. Ned believes Littlefinger\nand thinks it is a good idea to warn Cersei, Robb attends a wedding at the\nTwins thinking guest rite will keep him safe, and Jon never thinks that his own\nmen would break their vows by killing him after he lets the wildlings past the\nwall.</p><p>But unlike Ned and Robb, Jon is returned to life.</p><p>This seems to suggest Jon has a higher calling: a calling to\nwarn the world about the Others. This is also the moment when he begins to\nbecome &lsquo;exceptional&rsquo;. Whereas before he was a mere bastard with no claims who\nlived and died by his deeds alone, now the writers begin to upturn everything\nwe thought we knew about Jon. First, he breaks the &lsquo;death is final&rsquo; rule that\nmost of the characters are bound by. Then he leaves the Night&rsquo;s Watch because,\nwell, he died, so that&rsquo;s a nice loop hole. He helps take back Winterfell and,\ndespite thinking he would never, ever have any claim there, he is named King in\nthe North. And NOW we know that he is a Targaryen: the son of Rhaegar and\nLyanna (though most of the characters are currently unaware of this).</p><p>Jon has a very typical hero&rsquo;s journey in this way. Just an\nordinary guy, living his life with no designs on power. Then as time goes on it\nturns out he actually IS exceptional and may just be destined to save the whole\nworld. It&rsquo;s typical and, on paper, juuuust a little bit boring. Like I said at\nthe beginning, he&rsquo;s a bit of a cookie cutter hero. His arc is well executed but\nwe&rsquo;ve seen his story before. I think the major thing in Jon&rsquo;s favor is that his\nexceptionalism does not come into play until way far down his arc. And his\nstatus as a lost Targaryen prince remains unknown to him. Had he discovered his\n&lsquo;exceptional&rsquo; qualities earlier (Harry Potter style), it&rsquo;s likely that his arc\nwould be that of a typical chosen one. But, what people seem to like about him,\nis that he has <i>earned </i>much of the\nrespect he now has. He was chosen by the people because of his words <i>and </i>actions. And hey, we love the story\nof an underdog. But then&hellip;comes season seven.</p><p><b>Characters paralleled with Jon</b></p><p>Before we get to season seven stuff, I want to talk about characters often paralleled with Jon. The obvious character is Daenerys, and I talked about their parallels more in the Daenerys post. But also:</p><p>Sansa Stark: Jon&rsquo;s plot hit a lot of the same beats as Sansa&rsquo;s arc. They are both far away from home and isolated, they both have to survive in a place where they can&rsquo;t be honest (in King&rsquo;s Landing vs the wildlings) They have their lowest point at round abouts the same time. Season five ends with both of their futures/lives being uncertain (Jon got stabbed and Sansa jumped off a building).&nbsp; And then of course, when they came together in season six, they have both been on each other&rsquo;s team ever since, steadily growing as rulers. This is what a lot of Jonsas look to as important foreshadowing that they will eventually rule together as King and Queen.</p><p>Arya Stark: Jon and Arya were always the black sheep of the family and two of the closest siblings. Arya carries needle with her still so Jon gave her the first means to defend herself and was one of the few who took her seriously even as a child. There are more parallels between them in the book, but their reunion is one of the most built up things ever, so it will definetily make a splash in season 8. Also it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if one of them had to watch the other die because of their closeness.</p><p>Bran Stark: Jon and Bran are both the ones who have seen the Night King and are the ones most dedicated to stopping the Others. But Bran knows more than Jon. He saw Jon in season four while Jon was oblivious to him being there. Bran saw the Night King in visions and knew that something bad was coming long before Jon. And, now, Bran is the one who understands Jon&rsquo;s past. This foreshadows Bran being an important guide for Jon in season 8. He will be the one to reveal his true name.</p><p>Mance Rayder: Mance, like Jon, was chosen for leadership and Jon and he clearly had respect for each other as Jon eventually saves him from being burned to death. But season seven called an explicit parallel to Jon and Mance when Daenerys unknowingly quotes Jon in the cave:&nbsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t their survival more important than your pride?&rdquo; Mance, in his conversation, replies&nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck my pride&rdquo; because he knows its not about that. Jon, likewise, is not ruling the north for his pride. However this parallel with Mance is suggested as a reason he ultimately bends the knee.</p><p>Stannis: Stannis is the failed Azor Ahai where as Jon seems to, apparently, be the real Azor Ahai. Melisandre switches to believing in Jon after Stannis&rsquo; death and ressurects him. And Davos now advises Jon instead of Stannis. There is a sense that Jon is the new and improved Stannis who is just but is more merciful. He is the true&nbsp;&lsquo;prince that was promised&rsquo;. Daenerys could also be involved in this parallel.</p><p>Jaime: This is a much more subtle parallel because these two sort of run on opposite paths to each other. When Jaime and Jon meet (in a show-only scene), Jaime mocks Jon for his commitment to the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Jaime is bitter and over the world. Jon is naive and still believes the Night Watch to be full of heroes. Over the course of the show, Jaime has slowly regained his honor and vows have become important to him again, shown by him leaving Cersei to journey north and honor his pledge. Jon, on the other hand, has learned that the Night&rsquo;s Watch wasn&rsquo;t full of honor after all and that the world is a darker place. He even broke his own vows in season three. He is now more bitter about the world, but wiser. They seem to have met in the middle now. Jaime is not as awful and Jon is not as stupid. And they could become strong allies which is in direct conflict with their first meeting.</p><p>Ned and Robb: Of course, I briefly mentioned this already, but Jon seems to continuously follow in the footsteps of other Stark men. Both his father and brother were honorable and died. So did Jon though he, unlike them, gets a second chance.</p><p>Theon: Jon and Theon were both not quite Stark sons who wanted to be Stark sons and had a competitive relationship with Robb (and also each other) because of it. Theon made the wrong choice about his family (Greyjoy vs Stark) and Jon will soon face a choice of his own (Stark vs Targaryen) which will become clear in season eight.</p><p>Alright. Now that we&rsquo;ve gotten that out of the way:</p><p><b>Season Seven Jon and\n&ldquo;the Problem&rdquo;</b></p><p>So, fresh off of being raised to King in the North by his\npeople, Jon decides to bend the knee to Daenerys. Not instantly, of course. He\nputs up a fight about it for a while, not wanting to bend the knee to a woman\nhe barely knows. But eventually, after the wight hunt, he decides to put his\ntrust in Daenerys. He even goes so far as to tell Cersei about the alliance,\nalmost completely losing her help against the wights.</p><p>This was&hellip;let&rsquo;s say&hellip;a controversial decision.</p><p>In my investigation of Jon&rsquo;s tag on tumblr, this was by far\nthe thing people were most irritated about. Throwing away northern independence\nfor Daenerys did not sit well with some. And as far as I can tell, the reaction\nfell into three categories:</p><p><b>Number one: Jon&rsquo;s\ndecision is right and consistent with his character because he truly believes\nin Daenerys as a ruler and maybe it was a little dumb to tell Cersei about it,\nbut it was honorable and that is the Stark way.</b></p><p><b>Number 2: Jon&rsquo;s\ndecision is consistent with his character but that character should have gotten\nfucking smarter by now, like, come on Jon, can&rsquo;t you tell one single lie to\nCersei, and also your brother Robb did not work this hard for northern\nindependence so that you could throw it away at the drop of a hat you absolute\npiece of&ndash;</b></p><p><b>And Number 3: Jon&rsquo;s\ndecision is not what it seems and he has secret political agenda behind bending\nthe knee to Daenerys and he is playing the game now just like everyone else,\nwhich marks substantial character growth from &ldquo;the northern fool&rdquo;.</b></p><p>Just like the first time I am going to give all three of\nthese theories a fair shake from the perspective of those who believe in them.\nAnd, once again, none of these theories are without merit or precedence. I&rsquo;m\nnot covering theories that I think are totally contradicted by canon. I am also\nnot taking into account outside influences like the books or the actors\nopinions etc. I am going to try to make this a show only reading. Which one you\nagree with? Well that&rsquo;s up to you, but I hope we can once again all see each\nother&rsquo;s points of view and have a respectful discussion. Everyone was very nice\non the Daenerys post! So, without further ado:</p><p><b>Theory 1: Honest Jon</b></p><p>This theory takes Jon at his word on &lsquo;why he bent the knee&rsquo;,\nand it posits that his honesty and honor are his most prominent and important\ntraits. It&rsquo;s easy to see why. As I said earlier, Jon is perhaps the most\nstraight forward moral main character remaining to us. And he has always\nstriven to follow in his father&rsquo;s footsteps. So when he says &ldquo;I am true to my\nword&hellip;or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot\nserve two queens when I have already pledged myself to Daenerys of House\nTargaryen&rdquo; he is being honest. </p><p>It may seem like a stupid decision to be honest with Cersei,\nand that is indeed what got his father killed. But Jon acknowledges that fact\nwhen Tyrion demands an explanation: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to swear an oath I can&rsquo;t\nuphold. Talk about my father if you want and tell me that&rsquo;s the attitude that\ngot him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning\nanything. Then there are no more answers and better and better lies. And lies\nwon&rsquo;t help us in this fight.&rdquo;</p><p>This seems to solidify Jon as our most &ldquo;moral hero&rdquo;. When\neveryone else goes low, he goes high. Even though experience and everyone\naround him tells him to learn from his fathers mistakes and maybe stoop to\nplaying the game just once, he seems to prefer to honor Ned&rsquo;s memory by living\nas he did.</p><p>There is something honorable about this. The fact that Jon,\nwho died doing what he thought was right and got a rare second chance, still\nrefuses to play the game, makes him extraordinary in some way. And maybe it is\nwhat makes him fit to be a king. He really isn&rsquo;t too proud or too power hungry.\nHe does what he thinks is best for his people and in this particular theory, he\nthinks Daenerys is best for Westeros (we will talk about why in a bit). He\nwants to win this game a different way, which is a respectable notion. Many\npeople on this theory, it is fair to mention, support Jonerys, so this moment\nis also seen as a declaration of loyalty to his partner (which sweetens the\ndeal for the shippers).</p><p>Then, there&rsquo;s <b>Theory\n2: The Northern Fool, </b>which is held primarily by people who think Jon is an\nabsolute dumb ass. This is actually kind of a ship neutral theory? I&rsquo;ve seen\nJonerys, Jonsa and non-shippers all pass this theory around. That &nbsp;Jon is stupid and, likewise, so are the\nwriters. </p><p>Because <i>sure </i>Jon,\nhonor and honesty is all fine and dandy, but it seems as if you&rsquo;ve been\npreaching a lot about &lsquo;the greater good&rsquo;. The greater good which is defeating\nthe white walkers. So maybe the world will forgive one single lie.</p><p>People in this group side with Tyrion and Daenerys in this\nscenario. Like, thank you Jon for your loyalty but maybe make sure that the\nsuicide squad mission is actually worth it and not a complete waste of time. Or\nsomething. Maybe if the past few episodes could actually have some payoff, that\nwould be rad. I love not having my time wasted.</p><p>Support for this theory tends to spill over onto critique\nfor the writers, which we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more about later. Many viewers\nthink that Jon isn&rsquo;t meant to be as stupid as he comes across here. The\nwriters, it seems, are trying to get all viewers feel like the theory one\nsupporters, but their writing is kind of&hellip;meh during this season? They don&rsquo;t\nmake an effective case, in this scene, for Jon&rsquo;s honesty. Because maybe they&rsquo;re\njust forgetting how to do character development. Lord knows they forgot about\nArya&rsquo;s character development this season, so why not?</p><p>People in this camp also tend to agree with Sansa&rsquo;s line in\nthe first episode of season 7: That Jon needs to be smarter than his father and\nRobb because they died. This line seems like explicit advice that Jon should\nhave taken and the fact that he didn&rsquo;t perhaps foreshadows a bleak end for him.\nBut, of course, we&rsquo;ll get more into Jon&rsquo;s ending later. Right now, we&rsquo;re just\ntalking about his shining moment in the dragon pit.</p><p>The long and short of this theory is thus: Jon is true to\ncharacter, perhaps, but it only emphasizes how little he has grown and that he\nis doomed to make the same mistakes as his father and brother. A northern fool,\nuntil the end.</p><p>In both these theories, Jon has bent the knee to Daenerys\nwith sincerity. So we need to take a quick break to talk about why before we\nmove onto the outsider theory. </p><p>Why does Jon believe in Daenerys? What prompts him to bend\nthe knee in the boat? According to most readings, it is Daenerys&rsquo; change of\nheart. Throughout much of the season, Daenerys refuses to help Jon until he\nbends the knee. But in the boat, after seeing the true threat of the undead,\nshe believes him and vows to help him. No stipulations. No command for him to\nbend the knee. Believers of these theories put THIS as the moment. Because\nDaenerys is no longer demanding that he kneel, she is now acknowledging him as\nan equal and putting the people before her own pride (just like she told him to\ndo a few episodes previous). Because of her willingness to do this, and the\nfact that she came north to save them at great personal cost, he deems her\nworthy of being his queen.</p><p>Yes, he is supposedly giving up the north, but in his mind\nhe is putting it in good hands. And it isn&rsquo;t as if Jon is power hungry. He\ndoesn&rsquo;t really want power at all. He just wants to be sure that his people will\nbe safe and perhaps queen Daenerys and her dragons are the best way to ensure\nthat.</p><p>But then, there is a theory that posits that Jon&rsquo;s motives\nin season seven are not stupid at all, but rather they are a part of an\nintentional strategy. And this, of course, brings us to Political! Jon.</p><p><b>Theory 3: Political\nJon</b></p><p>This theory is going to take me a little bit longer to\nexplain. Because while theory one and two tend to take Jon&rsquo;s characterization\nat the surface level, this theory involves a lot of reading in between the\nlines. But first: a disclaimer. I think many people are under the impression\nthat all of those people who subscribe to Political Jon are Jonsas. This is\nlargely used to dismiss political Jon as being a delusion created in attempt to\nsupport a ship. But Political! Jon is by no means a theory exclusive to Jonsas\nand I wouldn&rsquo;t be covering it as a theory if I thought it was completely\ncontradicted by canon.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is: Most people\ngravitate toward Political! Jon NOT for the purpose of their favorite ship, but\nbecause of their love of Jon himself&ndash;and their deep and abiding desire for him\nto not be completely stupid.</p><p>Subscribers of theory two believe that Jon is stupid but\nhave accepted that as an error of the writing. Political Jon believers think\nthat his supposed &ldquo;stupidity&rdquo; is highly intentional and actually his own way of\nplaying the game. So. Let&rsquo;s break it down.</p><p>In this theory, Jon does not truly have feelings for\nDaenerys, nor does he think she will be a good queen. However, he does not see\nher as someone to trifle with and he knows that he will need her help to defeat\nthe White walkers. He also sees her as stronger than Cersei and better than\nCersei, so when he is asked to swear neutrality in the dragon pit, he sides with\nDaenerys just to make SURE that Daenerys buys his loyalty. He thinks that\nDaenerys will easily beat Cersei in a fight anyway.</p><p>First: the lying thing. Can honest Jon bring himself to lie\nto Daenerys? Can he bring himself to deceive at all when he strives to be so\nlike his father, Eddard Stark? And is there any precedent for him lying for the\ngreater good?</p><p>Turns out: Yes. Let&rsquo;s take a gander at season 3, shall we?</p><p>In season 3, Jon is captured by a group of wildlings and is\ncommanded by his superior, the Half Hand, to do whatever he can to gather\ninformation about Mance&rsquo;s army. This is, after all, a matter of grave\nimportance. It&rsquo;s not just Jon&rsquo;s life that is on the line&ndash;it&rsquo;s the lives of\neveryone beyond the wall if the wildlings get past.</p><p>So Jon kills the Halfhand and gains the trust of the\nwildlings. But he does more than that. He lies about the number of men at\nCastle Black, he lies about his motives and reasons for joining them, and he\neven breaks his vows by sleeping with a wildling woman. He has to keep up the\nact and does so pretty well, until he cannot bring himself to kill an innocent\nman south of the wall. Then he breaks and kills the wildling that was most\nsuspicious of him, proclaiming in a spiteful tone &ldquo;you were right the whole\ntime&rdquo;.</p><p>Jon may not be one who lies easily, but he lies when it\ncounts. He is willing to lie for the greater good. So&hellip;is it in character for\nhim to lie in season seven?</p><p>According to this theory, yes. Jon is concerned with one\nthing and one thing only: figure out a way to stop the White Walkers so he can\nprotect his people in the North. If the white walkers break through, the north\nwill be the first to suffer so he must make <i>absolutely\nsure </i>that doesn&rsquo;t happen. He goes south to Dragonstone to meet with Queen\nDaenerys because he has no other choice. She has the dragon glass they need <i>and </i>she could be a valuable ally in the\nfight.</p><p>However, in Jon&rsquo;s first meeting with her, he gets nowhere.\nHe is relatively honest in this meeting, pointing out that his people won&rsquo;t\nbend to a southern ruler and that he has no reason to bow to her because he\nbarely knows her. As a result of this conversation, he is ostensibly made a\nprisoner of the island. He can go where he wants but not to his ship. He can&rsquo;t\nhelp his people from the island so he needs to find out another way.</p><p>This is an important thing to note for people who don&rsquo;t know\nmuch about political Jon: Most of the believers of this theory are not saying\nthat Jon went to Dragonstone with the intent of being political. He did not hop\non a ship to &lsquo;go seduce the dragon queen&rsquo;. Of course not. Jon would only play\nthe manipulating game in the direst of circumstances. Rather, there is a point\nin season seven that, for many, marks Jon&rsquo;s shift from straight forward honesty\nto more subtle motivations. And it&rsquo;s his conversation with Tyrion.</p><p>Here, Jon realizes he has been &lsquo;a northern fool&rsquo;. He\nacknowledges it. He acknowledges that he should have listened to his men and to\nSansa when they said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t go south&rsquo;. But this acknowledgement isn&rsquo;t worth\nmuch unless he switches tactics. If he just says &lsquo;I&rsquo;m stupid&rsquo; but doesn&rsquo;t\nchange, then who cares? Now he has to actually listen to Sansa&rsquo;s advice. Be\nsmarter than father. Be smarter than Robb.</p><p>Jon doesn&rsquo;t abandon honestly all together, of course. He\nstill wants to prove to Daenerys that the white walkers exist. He wants to\npersuade her to see his side because if she doesn&rsquo;t, his people will probably\nall die. As he tries to get a read on this queen, he realizes a couple of\nimportant things: One, when she is angry she tends to jump to dragons and needs\nto be advised not to set King&rsquo;s Landing on fire and two, she is very wrapped up\nin the idea of Targaryen exceptionalism. She hates the idea of being just like\neverybody else.</p><p>So he plays to this. When she asks him what she should do in\nresponse to a losing battles, he implies that using her dragons against\ninnocents WOULD make her just like everybody else. And she wants to be more\nthan that. With just this one line, he is able to convince her to not burn King&rsquo;s\nLanding. Clearly Jon is beginning to understand how Daenerys works.</p><p>But still, he understands she is dangerous. At some point,\nhe decides that if he wants to really protect his people, he is going to need\nto be sure she is on their side. So he bends the knee in the boat. This is at a\nhopeless moment for Jon, after he&rsquo;s faced the army of the dead and realized how\nmuch help they are going to need. He doesn&rsquo;t want to surrender his people to a\nsouthern ruler, but he also knows independence won&rsquo;t last forever. Eventually,\nshe&rsquo;ll want to bring the north into the fold, so better to do it peacefully and\nprotect everyone.</p><p>Eventually, he even gives himself over to her in the\nbedroom. This is a progression from what happened with Ygritte. Ygritte made\nher want of Jon known and then demanded he break his vows to prove his loyalty.\nSo he did, and in doing so, earned her devotion. This time, he sees that\nDaenerys is developing feelings for him. So he decides to take the initiative\nhimself and visit her on the boat, giving himself to her to secure her loyalty\nto the north. Many people pointed out that having sex with a woman out of\nmarriage is a little bit out of character for Jon who vowed never to sire a bastard\n(and in a world where sex outside of marriage, especially for women, is heavily\nscorned). Unless of course, he&rsquo;s giving into what she wants (just like Ygritte\ndid). Apparently there was also a deleted scene or moment in the script when\nDaenerys<i> asked</i> him to come to her\nroom? Whatever, that&rsquo;s not relevant to this interpretation because we&rsquo;re only\nfocusing on what we get from the screen.</p><p>Again, all of this is done without malice from Jon. I saw a\npost arguing that political Jon meant Dark! Jon because he was manipulating\nDaenerys feelings. I think in some interpretations this is true, but in others,\nit seems Jon isn&rsquo;t planning to &lsquo;break Daenerys&rsquo; heart&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s entering into this\nsomewhat like a woman might enter into an arranged marriage in this time&ndash;&ldquo;this\nwill bring peace and she wants it, so fine. This is what&rsquo;s best for my people.&rdquo;</p><p>Many people believe that this is not Jon straight up\ntricking Daenerys with the plan of going &lsquo;just kidding! It was all a lie!&rsquo;\nlater on. It&rsquo;s Jon trying to secure the north. It&rsquo;s entirely likely that he\nplans to keep his word. But, just like with the wildlings, if Daenerys goes too\nfar or asks too much of Jon, he will break away. If it becomes clear that he\ncannot contain her &lsquo;fire and blood&rsquo; impulses, he will abandon her and return to\nfighting for his people.</p><p>So the precedent for Political Jon is set by Jon&rsquo;s season\nthree journey, but a lot of the evidence is found in Kit&rsquo;s acting. Many have\nobserved that in a lot of scenes, Jon does not appear all too thrilled with\nDaenerys. In some, he even looks uncomfortable. In the view of believers of\nthis theory, this acting choice is intentional and made to alert us to the fact\nthat Daenerys cares for Jon more than he cares for her. Which, yes, maybe. That&rsquo;s\na perfectly valid reading but&hellip;also&hellip;Kit&rsquo;s acting is kind of&hellip;wooden?</p><p>I mean it started out way more wooden and he&rsquo;s gotten better\nover time. But he&rsquo;s usually not one for a range of facial expressions. He does\nbetter depending on what actor he is working with. I think perhaps one of the\nreasons that Jonsa has become such a popular ship is that Kit has great\nchemistry on screen with Sophie Turner. He, likewise, had very good chemistry\nwith Rose. There are moments of good acting from Jon in season seven, but in a\nlot of scenes he just seems vaguely tired.</p><p>And this is the main debate to be had. Are all of these\nacting, writing and directing choices actually intentional? Or are they just errors?\nIt could just be that some of the dialogue was uninspired and Kit needed better\ndirection. Or it could be a very subtle build up. Regardless, we won&rsquo;t know for\nsure until we see season 8.</p><p><b>Jon&rsquo;s end:\nSacrificial Hero or King?</b></p><p>Putting aside the debate of whether or not Jon is political,\nwe need to talk about where he will end up. There are three possibilities for\nthis too (because three is a good number), and they actually quite mirror\nDaenerys&rsquo; possibilities.</p><p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>On the throne with Daenerys</b></p><p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>A Sacrificial hero</b></p><p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>On the throne without Daenerys (possibly\nwith Sansa)</b></p><p>So, first off, Jon and Daenerys could end up being the song\nof ice and fire together and the two Targaryens to bring about a restoration of\nthe Targaryen name, perhaps this time with less incest? (No sibling marriages\nguys. Please. A whole book just came out about why that fucked things up). It\nmakes sense on a symbolic level. The story begins with the Targaryens being\noutcasts and gone and could end with them once again being in power. Also, while\nDaenerys has been a contender for the throne since the very beginning, Jon has\nonly become a contender as recently as the end of season six, which means him\nending up on the throne would add an additional twist.</p><p>On the whole, both Targaryen heirs ending up on the throne\nand starting a new family does seem a little too happy and easy and perfect for\nGame of Thrones, so if this did happen, there would have to be collateral\ndamage of another sort. The deaths of other characters, perhaps the loss of\nwinterfell or even the destruction of the Red Keep itself. It&rsquo;s even likely\nthat if they rule together it will NOT be from the Iron Throne (because that\nthrone may very well get destroyed).</p><p>On the other hand, Jon could be a <b>sacrificial hero </b>and give his life in the battle to destroy the\nNight King. Now some might say: wait. Jon already died once. What would be the\npoint of just killing him off again? Well, this would actually play very well\ninto the heavy weight of death on this show. One of the major running themes of\ngame of thrones is &lsquo;Valar Morghulis&rsquo;. All men must die. If this is not the case\nand dead loved ones can be brought back without consequences, then death loses\na lot of weight. </p><p>There is a sense that perhaps Jon&rsquo;s return from the dead is\nonly temporary. He has come back to warn Westeros about the White Walkers,\nfight to save the realm and then die in the process. If this is the case, then\nit would put forth the message that no one can escape death. Sometimes, very\nrarely, you get a second chance. But that doesn&rsquo;t make you immortal. It is not\nJon&rsquo;s time yet but that time is coming soon. We see this foreshadowed with\nBerric Dondarian, who is a veteran at coming back. Now that Thoros of Myr is\ndead, his days are numbered as well. All of the dead will return to the ground\nbefore this series is over and Jon with them.</p><p>Or, perhaps not. In the third theory, Jon becomes king of\nthe Seven Kingdoms. Again, as he is a newer candidate for the throne, this is\nmore unexpected than Daenerys. Some who believe in this theory think that\nDaenerys will die as a hero and leave Jon alone to reluctantly carry on her\nlegacy. He&rsquo;s not a power hungry person and doesn&rsquo;t want the throne, but he&rsquo;s\nthe kind of character that keeps vows and does his duty. He will serve the\nrealm as its ruler even though his love is gone.</p><p>Or perhaps Daenerys is not his love. Perhaps, if the Dark\nDaenerys theory becomes real, he will be among those who help defeat her and\nthen become king of Westeros much the same way he became king of the North.\nBecause the people chose him. Those who subscribe to this theory often see him\nwith Sansa by his side as a wife (though that is not a requirement of this\ntheory). Whether he is romantically involved with Sansa or not, Jon will rely\nheavily on the Starks in this time as they are the ones who truly matter most\nto him.</p><p>And this brings us to the final question about Jon. <b>Stark or Targaryen?</b> Which of his sides\nwill he embrace or will he hold them both equally? I think for an answer to\nthis we have to go to Jon&rsquo;s scene with Theon in the Dragonstone throne room.\nThere are two important lines here. One is this: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to choose. You&rsquo;re\na Greyjoy and a Stark&rdquo;. This seems to be hinting that Jon himself will &lsquo;not\nchoose&rsquo;. He will also embrace being both a Stark and a Targaryen in equal\nparts. <i>However </i>there&rsquo;s another line\nas well: &ldquo;He (Ned Stark) was more a father to you than your own father&rdquo;. And\nthis seems to suggest that yes, even though Jon was born a Targaryen, nurture\ntrumps nature in this case. Rhaegar may be his blood father but <i>Ned </i>is the one who raised Jon. So\nultimately, his Stark half will be more important to him.</p><p>This scene could be read both ways. There&rsquo;s no scenario\nwhere Jon abandons his Stark heritage. Whether you see Jon&rsquo;s relationship with\nSansa as romantic or not it is VERY clear that he cares deeply about her. He\nalso cares very deeply about Arya and Bran (who I know I haven&rsquo;t talked a lot\nabout here in this piece but they&rsquo;ll get their own post, promise). We just\nhaven&rsquo;t gotten the chance to see him interact with them yet. He only just found\nout they were alive, after all. But there&rsquo;s no scenario where Jon turns his\nback on his family. But whether or not he chooses the Starks over the\nTargaryens or balances the two remains to be seen. </p><p>That&rsquo;s it for this read on Jon. Again, keep the comments\nrespectful and the discussion understanding. It&rsquo;s okay that people have\ndifferent perspectives than you! I obviously have a reading that I think is\nmost likely but I&rsquo;m not telling any of you here, lol.</p><p> Next time I&rsquo;m going\nto tackle Sansa and the many possible readings of her character. Happy\nThronesing everyone!</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Time to do some more parallel readings, this time with Jon\nSnow. This is a very different sort of reading from the Daenerys one (which is <a href=\"http://kallypsowrites.tumblr.com/post/180456877410/the-many-readings-of-game-of-thrones-part-1\">here</a>): mostly\nbecause no one is arguing that Jon is an antagonist. Or if they are, I sure\nhaven&rsquo;t seen it anywhere. This is perhaps because Jon is our most\nstraightforward hero left. He&rsquo;s the guy with the sword. The man with the easiest\nto plot hero&rsquo;s journey. He has gone from a bastard of Winterfell to the King in\nthe North. And over all? People really like Jon.<br /></p>\n<p>The main friction in the fandom seems to be Jonerys vs Jonsa\nright now but both of those groups? They love the heck out of Jon. And honestly\nI don&rsquo;t think Jon gets a whole lot of hate. At most he gets&hellip;neutral shrugs\nfrom the part of the fandom that just doesn&rsquo;t care that much about him. He also\ngets accused of being too cookie cutter as a hero sometimes. &nbsp;I think the most controversial thing he did\nwas bend the knee in season seven and we&rsquo;re going to cover the interpretations\nof why he did that&hellip;later.</p>\n<p>In fact this is going to be structured differently from the\nDaenerys reading. Because while my different readings of Daenerys start at the\nvery beginning of her journey, Jon&rsquo;s readings don&rsquo;t diverge until&hellip;later. Up\nuntil season six, in fact, the fandom has a pretty united opinion about him and\nit&rsquo;s really not until season seven that the conflict really starts. So first,\nlet&rsquo;s start with what everyone can agree on: Who is Jon Snow? More under the cut</p>\n</p>",
