But instead of reinforcing this pattern, media portrayals can offer positive alternatives instead.</p><p>There are two major examples of the <b>tragically closeted gay football player </b>on North American TV (aimed at teens) from the past decade that I know of: Riley Stavros from <i>Degrassi</i>, and Dave Karofsky from <i>Glee</i>. Both of these characters are closeted gay athletes who have very tragic storylines related to their internalized homophobia and self-hatred. I\u2019ll go into a summary of Riley\u2019s gay storyline below, for context on the issue.</p><ul><li>Riley is a star athlete, captain and quarterback on the football team. He pressures himself to perform normative masculinity and heterosexuality, trying to be\u00a0\u201cnormal.\u201d</li><li>He takes steroids, not only to boost his athletic abilities, but also in hopes that it will somehow make him straight.</li><li>He becomes more and more aggressive, lashing out at others due to his insecurity and self-loathing related to his gay thoughts. Riley distances himself from anything \u201cgay\u201d by retaliating with violence; for example, he punches Sam, an openly gay man that Riley is attracted to. The LGBT student group reaches out to offer sensitivity training so Riley can unlearn his homophobia, but Riley refers to the LGBT students as\u00a0\u201cfreaks.\u201d</li><li>Riley desperately searches\u00a0\u201chow not to be gay\u201d online and pursues conversion therapy, believing he can\u00a0\u201ccure\u201d this\u00a0\u201cdisease\u201d that he has (that is, until he realizes the therapy is expensive and sounds like a scam).</li><li>Riley finally admits to himself, and to one friend, that he is gay and that he needs to work on anger management. However, Riley wishes to remain closeted throughout high school, perhaps indefinitely.</li><li>He eventually gains a love interest, Zane, who is out and proud, but angst continues for a long time. Riley wants to stay closeted and maintain the persona of the\u00a0\u201cstraight football player\u201d at school; Zane receives homophobic harassment from other football players; the two fight over their secret relationship and Riley\u2019s inability to stand up for himself or for Zane; so on and so on. The two have some very sweet moments, but their arc is constantly darkened by the ever-present expectation of homophobic violence against them.</li></ul><p>Overall, this is a sympathetic and well-developed portrayal of a gay character; however, the show relies on <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftvtropes.org%2Fpmwiki%2Fpmwiki.php%2FMain%2FGayngst&amp;t=NjQxYzc5YWE3YjJlYjg3MDUzZmEyMTU3NGFmNTgwOGZjY2NmMGQyNCxkZDdlZWFmMjgzNDdlYTNiYTIwM2EyNmVlYWVhZTE1MjRhODBiOWNm\" target=\"_blank\">Gayngst </a>and <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftvtropes.org%2Fpmwiki%2Fpmwiki.php%2FMain%2FArmouredClosetGay&amp;t=NDAzZDg3NzM0ZjMxMzQxYjNlMWQzMmQxMjU1ZWFiMGUxYjAxNDM4NCxmZGEzMjlhNWI1ZDg4MjllMGQ0YjkzODhkMjM4OTQyNTlhODg3ZmUx\" target=\"_blank\">Armoured Closet Gay</a>\u00a0tropes.

So, it can be hard (as an LGBTQ person) to imagine a positive future for yourself, when all that you see are tragic stories about facing homophobia.</p><p>LGBTQ viewers, especially youth, need to see representations of same-gender relationships that are not always defined by cultural baggage. </p><h2>Instead of struggling with accepting your sexuality, what about the universal struggle of LIKING someone, period?

We\u2019ve already had a dramatic \u201ccoming out\u201d portrayal with Cyrus; it would be refreshing to see a contrasting portrayal (ie. TJ isn\u2019t ashamed of being gay or afraid to come out).

He \u201cdoesn\u2019t let anybody stand in his way\u201d (as he advises to Cyrus in the muffin scene). </p><p>So yes, TJ was worried about what people might think of him with his dyscalculia due to social stigmas, but after Cyrus comforts him, he quickly weighed his options and decided that playing basketball was most important; screw what anyone else might think if they found out about his dyscalculia. <b>Cyrus gives him confidence</b> when he says\u00a0\u201cnothings wrong with you\u201d and TJ seems to take that to heart. </p><p>So, once he realizes he has a chance with Cyrus, romantically, I think he would be the kind of person to GO for it. </p><p>I think the angst should come from TJ being unsure if Cyrus would reciprocate those feelings. I\u2019m sure TJ doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize their friendship, but he is clearly smitten&hellip; I firmly believe that he has an instant crush from their first meeting, and he was definitely going out of his way to talk to Cyrus in the swing scene (it\u2019s been said a million times but bears repeating: \u201cyou come here a lot?\u201d was phrased like a pickup line).</p><p>This is just my perspective on the topic, influences by my research on LGBT rep on TV.

I noticed a few of the actors, thought, \u201cHey, the Andi Mack kids!\u201d, then realized how weird it is he\u2019s discussing kids at his <i>age</i> and in the way he\u2019s <i>talking</i> about them. It\u2019s not a big deal to be a fan of these talented kids and give them some praise and exposure whether you\u2019re an adult or around their age, that\u2019s not what weirds me out about this youtuber.</p><p>His videos all feature him reacting to a lot of kids 15 and under, videos of them twerking or doing something inappropriate or kissing each other or him just discussing their relationships.
