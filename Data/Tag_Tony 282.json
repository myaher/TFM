He turned\nback to Peter, horrified. </p><p>Peter smirked and glanced pointedly at the ceiling. </p><p>There, in the corner, was the container of beans, held far\nout of reach by very familiar webbing.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you trying to kill me, kid?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Peter said, pouring himself another bowl\nof cereal. He had to eat at least three if he didn&rsquo;t want to be starving by second\nperiod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to keep you alive longer. Coffee is really bad for you in\nlarge quantities, Tony. Especially if you have a heart condition.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sunk back into his seat, looking to Maggie for some\nkind of support. She came and laid her head on his knee, her lolling tongue\ngetting his pajama pants wet. </p><p>&ldquo;But, Pete, I need coffee to function,&rdquo; he whined.</p><p>&ldquo;And you have some.&rdquo; Peter gestured at Tony&rsquo;s still steaming\nmug on the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not cutting you off, just helping you cut back.&rdquo; He\nflashed a grin over at Tony. Tony pouted. </p><p>&ldquo;I could just get in my suit and fly up there and get it,&rdquo;\nTony pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;You could,&rdquo; Peter conceded. There was a beat. &ldquo;But I would\nbe very disappointed.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Checkmate</i>, Tony\nthought bitterly. He slumped in his chair and Peter smiled, knowing he had won.</p><p>He stood and took his bowl to the sink. Tony took a sip of\nhis coffee, savoring the taste much more than he usually would. </p><p>Peter grabbed his backpack from an empty chair. &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m\noff. Bye, Mags,&rdquo; he said, accepting her slobbery kisses graciously. &ldquo;Bye, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony scowled at him. Peter laughed. He came back to stand by\nTony&rsquo;s chair, leaning down and pressing a quick kiss to his cheek. Tony felt\nhis face softening against his better judgment as he looked up at Peter smiling\ndown at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Tony,&rdquo; Peter tried again.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Pete,&rdquo; Tony said, unable to smother the fond smile\nturning up the corners of his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;No more coffee,&rdquo; Peter reminded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. Get out of here.&rdquo; Tony swatted at him\naffectionately. Peter skipped out of reach and to the door, shooting one last\ngrin over his shoulder.</p><p>After the door closed behind him, Tony looked down at Maggie\nas she ate her own breakfast. </p><p>&ldquo;No chance you are actually a super dog and can climb walls\nlike your favorite human?&rdquo; Maggie looked up from her food and gave a short yip.\n</p><p>Tony sighed. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo; Peter called as he entered, toeing off his\nshoes in the doorway and dropping his backpack on top of them. He stopped in\nthe kitchen, dug some Goldfish out of the cupboard to snack on before dinner. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; No answer. &ldquo;Come here, Maggie.&rdquo; Still nothing.</p><p>Eyebrows furrowing, Peter walked into the living room,\nwondering where his family was. </p><p>His question was answered as he saw Tony passed out on the\ncouch, his head thrown back against the arm. Maggie was sprawled on the floor\nnext to him, her own wheezy breathing a counterpoint to Tony&rsquo;s snoring. </p><p>Peter grinned and pulled out his phone, snapping a few\nphotos. Then he tiptoed over and draped his favorite flannel throw over Tony.\nHis adopted dad shifted, curling one hand over the blanket. </p><p>Maggie blinked up at him tiredly as he stepped over her. He\nheld up a finger to his lips and shushed her. She seemed to shrug and go back\nto sleep. </p><p>Peter grabbed his homework and settled in the armchair,\nquietly munching on his snack while Tony slept. Day one of Operation: Keep Tony\nAlive Forever was a success.<i></i></p>",
