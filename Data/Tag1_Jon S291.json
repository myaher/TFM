Today wasn\u2019t a part of her schemes when she was little but her handmaidens tell me that she likes her dress. But Gendry is baffled,\u201d Jon laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs he?

You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologies, Your Grace.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Jon sighs.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been seven years, yet it hasn\u2019t grown on me. Seems like yesterday we went north of the wall and took our\u00a0vows. We swore to never own lands and take titles, to not take wives and have children. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve broken all of them,\u201d Jon says.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere were you? I was looking for you some hours ago,\u201d Sam asks.</p><p>\u201cThe entire capital knows where I was. And you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! You were riding Drogon. The beast needed some fresh air. He had been in the Dragonspit for a month.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Jon walks towards a window in front of him and looks out.</p><p>\u201cHe reminds me of her.

She was fighting for many lives. I know, it\u2019s a pity. Life is not fair but life goes on. You know that better than most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye! I guess I do.\u201d Jon smiles a little, just to show Sam that he is okay.</p><p>\u201cWill you ever tell Ned?\u201d Sam says after a pause.</p><p>\u201cTell him what?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cAbout his real mother. About Daenerys. You didn\u2019t know about your real mother for a long time but it is a different situation for Ned. Unlike you, he won\u2019t be killed by the King for it.\u201d Sam says.</p><p>\u201cWhat good will that do? And he has a mother just like I had a father. The only father I knew, and the only one I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you will let him think his entire life that his real mother is Sansa? She was his aunt but you made her his mother when you married her after the war.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI married Sansa to unite the seven kingdoms. I am a Targaryen. And even though I was a Northman my entire life, the northern lords needed a better reason than that to give up their dream of independence and bend the knee to another Targaryen. I did it for the realm.\u201d Jon says softly.</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever happened is behind us. Today is a day of celebration. But I\u2019m warning ya. If someday he finds out that his mother is not Sansa and that you decided to keep it from him, he won\u2019t forgive you.

Lady Arya is waiting for you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Luck,\u201d Sam says as he leaves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come too far from home Ser Davos,\u201d Jon says after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cThis your home now, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like home. I was never supposed to be here. I was never supposed to be King. I thought I would end my life on the wall, shivering for warmth. I have come way too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were supposed to be a bastard too. But suddenly you decided to become the true heir. You were supposed to be dead. But, you came back. Let\u2019s face it, Jon, you\u2019ve surprised life more than life has surprised you. Do you really think this is the biggest one?\u201d Davos says.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you put it on your list?\u201d Jon asks.</p><p>\u201cProbably at the bottom, Your Grace,\u201d Davos replies.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye! The bottom seems about right.&rdquo; </p><p>Ser Davos has a letter in his hand and he looks hesitant.</p><p>Finally, he begins,\u00a0\u201cThere was a raven, Your Grace, from Winterfell, from Lord Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that sounds like home. He still prefer being called Bran though.\u201d He smiles a little.\u00a0\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has had another vision,\u201d Ser Davos looks concerned.</p><p>Ser Davos hands him the letter. Jon sits down.

                "content": "<p><h1>[Fan-fiction] GoT S8E6- The Final Sequence</h1><p>The screen comes back to light after a couple of seconds of darkness. We see the Sun shining over the Red Keep and a welcome buzz around the city of King&rsquo;s Landing</p><p>&lsquo;A few years later&rsquo;, the screen says.&nbsp;</p><p>The camera moves along a room inside the Red Keep and we hear a familiar voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on Ned, I know you know this one. You only learned it last week,&rdquo; Sam says.</p><p>Little Ned thinks for a second and then says,&nbsp;&ldquo;Highgarden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well lad! Now, which is next house on your list of the Great House of Westeros that are now extinct?&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, we see a silhouette of a man behind Ned. Youthful, dark hair and a muscular build.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, Lannister. Words- Hear me roar! Sigil- A Golden Lion on a field of crimson. The seat of power- Casterly Rock.&rdquo;</p><p>We hear someone clapping in a distance.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Ned screams.&nbsp;</p><p>We see Ned running into the arms of Jon as he embraces him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing good. I think Grand Maester would agree that today&rsquo;s class can be concluded now.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam nods.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on now. Your mother is looking for you,&rdquo; Jon says to Ned who then runs out of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t your services required downstairs Grand Maester?&rdquo; Jon asks.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Your Grace,&rdquo; Sam replies.</p><p>They laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, will he come to me in 10 years and tell me he wants to be a maester?&rdquo; Jon asks.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Rubbish! He is Jon Snow&rsquo;s son. He won&rsquo;t enjoy that life. Boredom isn&rsquo;t in his blood.&rdquo; They laugh again.</p><p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; asks Sam.</p><p>&ldquo;She is fine. Today wasn&rsquo;t a part of her schemes when she was little but her handmaidens tell me that she likes her dress. But Gendry is baffled,&rdquo; Jon laughs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is he? Doesn&rsquo;t know where to put it? Didn&rsquo;t you tell him where to put it?&rdquo; Sam smiles.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about my sister. You know that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apologies, Your Grace.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace.&rdquo; Jon sighs.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been seven years, yet it hasn&rsquo;t grown on me. Seems like yesterday we went north of the wall and took our&nbsp;vows. We swore to never own lands and take titles, to not take wives and have children. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve broken all of them,&rdquo; Jon says.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where were you? I was looking for you some hours ago,&rdquo; Sam asks.</p><p>&ldquo;The entire capital knows where I was. And you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! You were riding Drogon. The beast needed some fresh air. He had been in the Dragonspit for a month.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Jon walks towards a window in front of him and looks out.</p><p>&ldquo;He reminds me of her. He is the only one who can. It&rsquo;s been seven years since the war and sometimes I can&rsquo;t even remember her face.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Sam looks sad and moves forward to comfort Jon.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Most of us were fighting for our lives. She was fighting for many lives. I know, it&rsquo;s a pity. Life is not fair but life goes on. You know that better than most.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye! I guess I do.&rdquo; Jon smiles a little, just to show Sam that he is okay.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you ever tell Ned?&rdquo; Sam says after a pause.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him what?&rdquo; Jon asks.</p><p>&ldquo;About his real mother. About Daenerys. You didn&rsquo;t know about your real mother for a long time but it is a different situation for Ned. Unlike you, he won&rsquo;t be killed by the King for it.&rdquo; Sam says.</p><p>&ldquo;What good will that do? And he has a mother just like I had a father. The only father I knew, and the only one I needed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you will let him think his entire life that his real mother is Sansa? She was his aunt but you made her his mother when you married her after the war.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I married Sansa to unite the seven kingdoms. I am a Targaryen. And even though I was a Northman my entire life, the northern lords needed a better reason than that to give up their dream of independence and bend the knee to another Targaryen. I did it for the realm.&rdquo; Jon says softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, whatever happened is behind us. Today is a day of celebration. But I&rsquo;m warning ya. If someday he finds out that his mother is not Sansa and that you decided to keep it from him, he won&rsquo;t forgive you. Ned Stark is dead but would you have forgiven him had he lived?&rdquo;</p><p>We see Ghost approaching from behind with Ser Davos who is wearing the badge of The Hand of the King- the first crabber&rsquo;s son to wear the badge, as Stannis put it all those years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time, Your Grace. Lady Arya is waiting for you downstairs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good Luck,&rdquo; Sam says as he leaves.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come too far from home Ser Davos,&rdquo; Jon says after a few minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;This your home now, Your Grace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t feel like home. I was never supposed to be here. I was never supposed to be King. I thought I would end my life on the wall, shivering for warmth. I have come way too far.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you were supposed to be a bastard too. But suddenly you decided to become the true heir. You were supposed to be dead. But, you came back. Let&rsquo;s face it, Jon, you&rsquo;ve surprised life more than life has surprised you. Do you really think this is the biggest one?&rdquo; Davos says.</p><p>&ldquo;Where would you put it on your list?&rdquo; Jon asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Probably at the bottom, Your Grace,&rdquo; Davos replies.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye!
