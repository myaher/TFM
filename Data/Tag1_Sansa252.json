If you guys haven\u2019t read\nthe meta yet, please go and read it. @jonsa101 always has some very interesting\ninterpretations and theories regarding the show and I really enjoy her meta\nwork.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0I was already planning on discussing this scene in detail as part of\nmy upcoming series on all the Jonsa scenes but since she tagged me in the meta,\nI thought I\u2019d discuss it now.</p><p>I have to say that after reading her post, I had a look at lists of\nromantic tropes as well as my favorite research source \u2013 youtube \u2013 in order to\ntry and find similar examples of the \u201cundermine me\u201d line. I\u2019m afraid I came out\nempty on this one. </p><p>\u00a0However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that whether\nor not you identify this particular line as a trope, the whole exchange between\nthem ticks a lot of romantic tropes off the list as I\u2019ll show below.</p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0This is one of the things that always bothers me about people calling\nJonsa shippers delusional. Even if Jonsa never becomes canon, it\u2019s very much a\nfact that the writers are playing with romantic expectations in all of their\nscenes. You can\u2019t swing a stick in the direction of these two without one trope\nor another hitting you smack in the face. So at the very least, Jonsa shippers\nare responding to these visual and storytelling devices. Hardly a delusion.</p><p>\u00a0For the interests of this meta I will focus strictly on the tropes\nused in this particular scene, which considering that it\u2019s only 3 minutes long,\nI was shocked to find out is more than 1. For reference, I\u2019m working off the\nlist of romantic tropes found <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes\">here</a> as well as use\nthe explanation they give for each of them. When you have the\ntime, check it out. It\u2019s like an Easter Egg Hunt for Jonsas.</p><p>\u00a0<b>Like an Old Married Couple: </b><i>These two people are very close and tend to\nbicker with each other.</i></p><p>\u00a0This is where I would actually place the \u201cundermine me\u201d line. In fact\nthis is where I would put this entire exchange:</p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: I can\u2019t question your decisions anymore? </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Of course you can but \u2026</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Joffery never let anyone question his authority. Do you think\nhe was a good king?</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0<i>Ahem \u2026 guys, I reeeally don\u2019t\nthink you\u2019re fighting over what you think you\u2019re fighting over. Also can you\nair your dirty married laundry in private? You\u2019re making everyone\nuncomfortable!</i></p><p>\u00a0Now, <b>Like an Old Married Couple</b>\nis usually served with a generous helping of the <b>Belligerent Sexual Tension</b> and/or <b>Unresolved Sexual Tension </b>tropes on the side. Which would explain\nthe seemingly random insert of Joffery in this whole conversation (there\u2019s more\nto it than that but more on that later). I mean doesn\u2019t every girl compare her\nbrother to her ex-boyfriend? Isn\u2019t that a thing that people do all the time?</p><p>\u00a0The thing that is very interesting here is the way these two are\noperating. There\u2019s nothing really sibling-like about this interaction. This is\ntwo partners having a fight.</p><p>\u00a0But this is where it gets interesting. Because this exchange is\nfollowed by another trope:</p><p>\u00a0<b>Aww, Look! They Really Do Love\nEach Other: </b><i>No matter how much they\nfight, they really do care about each other very much.</i></p><blockquote><p>Jon: You think I\u2019m Joffery? </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re as far from Joffery as anyone I\u2019ve ever met. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Thank you!</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Throughout my series on the Jon/D*ny romance (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/176964692831/why-the-jondaenerys-romance-doesnt-work-part-1?is_related_post=1\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177125826726/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-2\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177169140396/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-3\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177459193506/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-4\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177459554456/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-4\">X</a>), I\nkept talking about how Jon and Dany never seem to reach a consensus or resolve\nanything in any of their fights. Every Jonsa scene comes in direct contrast to\nthat. It isn\u2019t the absence of fighting that makes a couple work, it\u2019s them\nbeing able to resolve and move on from a fight that does. And this is where\nthis trope comes in. No matter how hard Jon and Sansa have a go at each other,\nyou are never left in any doubt that they care about one another.</p><p>\u00a0But there\u2019s more \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>Dismissing a Compliment: </b><i>A character doesn&rsquo;t believe something nice\ntheir Love Interest tells them.</i></p><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re good at this, you know. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: At what?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: At ruling.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: No \u2026</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You are. (beat) You are. </p></blockquote><p>\u00a0<i>Why don\u2019t you say it again,\nSans? I don\u2019t think he heard you the last two times \u2026</i></p><blockquote><p><i>\u00a0</i>Sansa: They respect you. They really do \u2026</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0<i>Ok, ok. Sheesh!

Is it any small wonder this might seem familiar to\npeople? Either way you want to slice it, you have seen these visual and\nnarrative cues in other stories. Tropes don\u2019t become tropes because no one ever\nused them. </p><p>\u00a0Now I did title this meta \u201cthe infamous undermine me scene\u201d for a\nreason. That\u2019s because this scene, as almost all Jonsa scenes, has three layers\nthat are all thrown at the audience simultaneously. Two of these layers are\ngood, one of these layers is BAD. Let\u2019s see if you guess which is which:</p><p>\u00a0<b>What the characters are\nfighting about</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>This is where the whole text vs. subtext analysis comes in. Ideally,\nany scene in any story you ever read or watch, should have both a surface level\nas well as subtext. Now and again you will get scenes, out of necessity, that\nare simply what they say on the tin but writers are actively dissuaded from\ndoing this on the whole. It would be very boring and frankly poor storytelling\nif subtext was non-existent and people simply talked at each other, complete\nwith an accurate, objective narrative on what they\u2019re saying and why they\u2019re\nsaying it. To put it simply, it wouldn\u2019t be a satisfying journey for the\naudience.</p><p>\u00a0So what is the surface level? Well, this is a direct follow-up to the preceding\nscene where Jon pardons Alice and Ned and Sansa argues against it. The argument\ngot pretty heated between the two of them so now we\u2019re given a scene where we\ncan see the resolution of said argument.</p><p>\u00a0What you should keep in mind at this stage is how that argument ended:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families\nof the men who died fighting for you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: [\u2026] I will not punish a son for his father\u2019s sins and I will not\ntake a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is\nmy decision and my decision is final. </p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Check-mate, as they say. Jon won that argument. He is the king and he\nmade his decision. Case closed. On a purely surface level, that argument was\nfinalized. We didn\u2019t really need the \u201cundermine me\u201d scene unless we attempt to\ninfer things that are no presented to us directly.</p><p>\u00a0Which brings us to \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>What the characters are really fighting about</b></p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0The question here is why does Jon feel undermined? I think the answer\nis not because he doesn\u2019t want Sansa questioning his decisions, as she seems to\nbelieve. Nor is it because he suspects some sort of nefarious ulterior motive\n(we\u2019ll leave that for that pesky 3<sup>rd</sup> layer we\u2019ll talk about shortly).</p><p>\u00a0We all know Jon values dialogue\nand collaboration. What we also know is that whatever Sansa says affects him\nvery deeply. You can deduce this from their scenes but, for confirmation, we\nalso have Kit saying that Sansa \u201ctwists\u201d Jon. So we can assume that their\nargument hurts him in some way and even though he put his foot down during the\nmeeting, he still feels the need to clarify the issue with her which is why\nthey\u2019re having the conversation.</p><p>\u00a0Now people have pointed out that, as one of his vassals, Sansa has\nevery right to question him publicly. The problem is that\u2019s not how Jon sees\nher. He very distinctly separates Sansa from the rest of his court. And since\nwe already had the \u201cwe need to trust each other\u201d scene at the end of season 6,\nI think it\u2019s safe to assume that he sees the two of them as a unit that is\nsupposed to be on the same page so the fact that Sansa speaks out against him in\npublic, instead of privately, feels like a betrayal.</p><p>\u00a0There\u2019s also his character and history to consider. Jon has never been\nthe kind of person to take criticism very well, mostly because he\u2019s felt\nunworthy and rejected all his life. And now he\u2019s gone from the Bastard of\nWinterfell to King in the North in the span of a few months. That would leave\njust about anyone feeling uncertain of how much people truly trust their judgement.</p><p>\u00a0However, if there\u2019s one thing you learn sooner or later, is that there\nare two sides to every story. That\u2019s why it\u2019s never a good idea to side with\none party whenever couples fight.</p><p>\u00a0Because if we look at things from Sansa\u2019s perspective, you can see how\nshe might feel dismissed. The fact of the matter is Jon isn\u2019t the world\u2019s\ngreatest communicator and failed to talk his decision over with Sansa before\nannouncing it to the Council, which in turn makes Sansa feel sidelined, hence\nher aggressive snark and Joffrey digs. And we get an explanation of that here:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: He [Ned] was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see\nhow dirty the world really is but father couldn\u2019t protect me and neither can\nyou. So stop trying. </p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Sansa is operating under a false assumption as well. Jon looks at\ntheir argument and feels undermined. Sansa looks at Jon avoiding her counsel\nand thinks that he does it because he sees her as his little sister that is in\nneed of protection.</p><p>\u00a0Now Jon, bless his heart, does try to put Sansa in the little sister\nbox at times but he fails at it miserably, partly because Sansa doesn\u2019t let him\nand partly because what he needs from her is very far removed from what sisters\nusually provide.</p><p>\u00a0So there they are \u2026 two \u201csiblings\u201d stuck on a balcony having a lovers quarrel.\nJust another day at Winterfell.</p><p>\u00a0Which brings us to what I like to call \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>The \u201cD&amp;D screwing with us\u201d\nlayer</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>Why do I say that the writers are screwing with us in this scene?\nWell, because of this:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: Joffery never let anyone question his authority. Do you think\nhe was a good king?</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0There is absolutely no reasonable explanation for why they felt the\nneed to bring Joffery, one of the worst people this show has ever inflicted on us,\nin this conversation. Firstly, because there is no parallel to be drawn between\nJon and Joffery in this situation. For one, if Joffrey was the king here, Alice\nand Ned\u2019s heads would be decorating the walls. They would certainly not have been\nbrought back into the fold which is what Jon has done for them. Secondly, since\nJon is very much talking his head off to Sansa at the moment, it\u2019s pretty obvious\nthat he isn\u2019t above explaining his reactions.</p><p>\u00a0What she says is, honestly, incredibly insulting which is why she\nbacktracks out of it as quickly as the writers would allow:</p><blockquote><p>Jon: Do you think I\u2019m Joffrey?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re as far from Joffrey as anyone I\u2019ve ever met. <i>(all the\nwhile looking extremely guilty) </i></p></blockquote><p>\u00a0If the mention is here in order to clue us in on the fact that Sansa\nviews Jon as something other than her brother, by comparing him to the only\nperson she\u2019s ever had romantic feelings for, there\u2019s again no need for that.\nSeven romantic tropes in one 3-minute scene is more than enough to get that\npoint across.</p><p>\u00a0So why do the writers have her say this? I would argue that this\nmention is in here in order to advance the \u201cdarkSansa\u201d agenda, particularly since\nthis is a scene where Jon says he feels undermined by her twice.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter that Sansa backtracks on the Joffrey fiasco, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter that she tells him she doesn\u2019t want to undermine him, while\ndesperately sighing with loving eyes that she wants him to listen to her. \u00a0The \u201cdarkSansa\u201d idea sticks.</p><p>\u00a0And that\u2019s because the audience support is very much skewed \u00a0in \u00a0Jon\u2019s\nfavor. Being on tumblr, sometimes you forget that the Jonsa fam is very\nmuch the minority and that exclusive Sansa fans are the unicorns of this fandom\n(#love4unicorns). The vast majority of this audience will not look at Jon as\nan unreliable narrator, as every character in this show is, but as the\nultimate authority on how this scene should be viewed.</p><p>\u00a0If he says he feels undermined, then it must be because he\u2019s being\nundermined, which by extension means that Sansa will betray him. And her\nmentioning Joffery only helps to further antagonize the audience against her.</p><p>\u00a0Does that mean the Ds want us to hate Sansa for no particular reason?\nNot really. What they really, really want is to, yet again, beat the \u201cStarkbowl\u201d\nhorse until it expires from exhaustion. And they\u2019re willing to compromise\nemotional development and cut off the audience from essential POVs to achieve\nthat.</p><p>\u00a0In season 6, when they first teased Starkbowl, they did it for\nemotional turmoil. They gave us that beautiful, heart breaking reunion scene\nonly to immediately have Sansa start to be seemingly duplicitous. Because\nwouldn\u2019t it be just so tragic that after Jon found new purpose in\nlife through Sansa and she finally found safety and comfort with someone that\nactually cared for her, she would turn everything on its head and betray him?</p><p>\u00a0In season 7, they wanted to resurrect it because of the Littlefinger\ntwist ending. This little \u201cJoffrey\u201d titbit and the \u201cundermining\u201d conversation\nhelped plant the seeds for it so when Arya (another fan favorite) began\naccusing her of plotting against Jon, the audience would have this early scene\nto fall back on, despite the fact that Sansa continuously supports Jon\u2019s policy\nwhile he\u2019s away and constantly talks about him, to the point where she almost\nsounds like Sam talking about Gilly.</p><p>\u00a0What I\u2019m trying to get at with this example is that the writers are\nnot operating in good faith when telling this story. They will constantly throw\nthings in to tease plot points that never come to pass. I don\u2019t like\nthis narrative choice at all, because it requires being cut off from certain\ncharacters POVs (Jon and Sansa are champions of this in season 7) which in turn\nputs distance between the audience and them, when the core of good storytelling\nto me is seeing characters wrestle with decisions and emotions not off-screen, but\nright before our eyes.</p><p>However, at the very least, what all of this should tell you, is that\nyou should never simply relay on what the\u00a0\u2018explicit\u2019 meaning of a scene is because there\u2019s far more lurking beneath the surface.\u00a0</p>",

Even if Jonsa never becomes canon, it\u2019s very much a\nfact that the writers are playing with romantic expectations in all of their\nscenes. You can\u2019t swing a stick in the direction of these two without one trope\nor another hitting you smack in the face. So at the very least, Jonsa shippers\nare responding to these visual and storytelling devices. Hardly a delusion.</p><p>\u00a0For the interests of this meta I will focus strictly on the tropes\nused in this particular scene, which considering that it\u2019s only 3 minutes long,\nI was shocked to find out is more than 1. For reference, I\u2019m working off the\nlist of romantic tropes found <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes\">here</a> as well as use\nthe explanation they give for each of them. When you have the\ntime, check it out. It\u2019s like an Easter Egg Hunt for Jonsas.</p><p>\u00a0<b>Like an Old Married Couple: </b><i>These two people are very close and tend to\nbicker with each other.</i></p><p>\u00a0This is where I would actually place the \u201cundermine me\u201d line. In fact\nthis is where I would put this entire exchange:</p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: I can\u2019t question your decisions anymore? </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Of course you can but \u2026</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Joffery never let anyone question his authority. Do you think\nhe was a good king?</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0<i>Ahem \u2026 guys, I reeeally don\u2019t\nthink you\u2019re fighting over what you think you\u2019re fighting over. Also can you\nair your dirty married laundry in private? You\u2019re making everyone\nuncomfortable!</i></p><p>\u00a0Now, <b>Like an Old Married Couple</b>\nis usually served with a generous helping of the <b>Belligerent Sexual Tension</b> and/or <b>Unresolved Sexual Tension </b>tropes on the side. Which would explain\nthe seemingly random insert of Joffery in this whole conversation (there\u2019s more\nto it than that but more on that later). I mean doesn\u2019t every girl compare her\nbrother to her ex-boyfriend? Isn\u2019t that a thing that people do all the time?</p><p>\u00a0The thing that is very interesting here is the way these two are\noperating. There\u2019s nothing really sibling-like about this interaction. This is\ntwo partners having a fight.</p><p>\u00a0But this is where it gets interesting. Because this exchange is\nfollowed by another trope:</p><p>\u00a0<b>Aww, Look! They Really Do Love\nEach Other: </b><i>No matter how much they\nfight, they really do care about each other very much.</i></p><blockquote><p>Jon: You think I\u2019m Joffery? </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re as far from Joffery as anyone I\u2019ve ever met. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Thank you!</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Throughout my series on the Jon/D*ny romance (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/176964692831/why-the-jondaenerys-romance-doesnt-work-part-1?is_related_post=1\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177125826726/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-2\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177169140396/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-3\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177459193506/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-4\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177459554456/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-4\">X</a>), I\nkept talking about how Jon and Dany never seem to reach a consensus or resolve\nanything in any of their fights. Every Jonsa scene comes in direct contrast to\nthat. It isn\u2019t the absence of fighting that makes a couple work, it\u2019s them\nbeing able to resolve and move on from a fight that does. And this is where\nthis trope comes in. No matter how hard Jon and Sansa have a go at each other,\nyou are never left in any doubt that they care about one another.</p><p>\u00a0But there\u2019s more \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>Dismissing a Compliment: </b><i>A character doesn\u2019t believe something nice\ntheir Love Interest tells them.</i></p><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re good at this, you know. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: At what?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: At ruling.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: No \u2026</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You are.

Is it any small wonder this might seem familiar to\npeople? Either way you want to slice it, you have seen these visual and\nnarrative cues in other stories. Tropes don\u2019t become tropes because no one ever\nused them. </p><p>\u00a0Now I did title this meta \u201cthe infamous undermine me scene\u201d for a\nreason. That\u2019s because this scene, as almost all Jonsa scenes, has three layers\nthat are all thrown at the audience simultaneously. Two of these layers are\ngood, one of these layers is BAD. Let\u2019s see if you guess which is which:</p><p>\u00a0<b>What the characters are\nfighting about</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>This is where the whole text vs. subtext analysis comes in. Ideally,\nany scene in any story you ever read or watch, should have both a surface level\nas well as subtext. Now and again you will get scenes, out of necessity, that\nare simply what they say on the tin but writers are actively dissuaded from\ndoing this on the whole. It would be very boring and frankly poor storytelling\nif subtext was non-existent and people simply talked at each other, complete\nwith an accurate, objective narrative on what they\u2019re saying and why they\u2019re\nsaying it. To put it simply, it wouldn\u2019t be a satisfying journey for the\naudience.</p><p>\u00a0So what is the surface level? Well, this is a direct follow-up to the preceding\nscene where Jon pardons Alice and Ned and Sansa argues against it. The argument\ngot pretty heated between the two of them so now we\u2019re given a scene where we\ncan see the resolution of said argument.</p><p>\u00a0What you should keep in mind at this stage is how that argument ended:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families\nof the men who died fighting for you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: [\u2026] I will not punish a son for his father\u2019s sins and I will not\ntake a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is\nmy decision and my decision is final. </p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Check-mate, as they say. Jon won that argument. He is the king and he\nmade his decision. Case closed. On a purely surface level, that argument was\nfinalized. We didn\u2019t really need the \u201cundermine me\u201d scene unless we attempt to\ninfer things that are no presented to us directly.</p><p>\u00a0Which brings us to \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>What the characters are really fighting about</b></p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0The question here is why does Jon feel undermined? I think the answer\nis not because he doesn\u2019t want Sansa questioning his decisions, as she seems to\nbelieve. Nor is it because he suspects some sort of nefarious ulterior motive\n(we\u2019ll leave that for that pesky 3<sup>rd</sup> layer we\u2019ll talk about shortly).</p><p>\u00a0We all know Jon values dialogue\nand collaboration. What we also know is that whatever Sansa says affects him\nvery deeply. You can deduce this from their scenes but, for confirmation, we\nalso have Kit saying that Sansa \u201ctwists\u201d Jon. So we can assume that their\nargument hurts him in some way and even though he put his foot down during the\nmeeting, he still feels the need to clarify the issue with her which is why\nthey\u2019re having the conversation.</p><p>\u00a0Now people have pointed out that, as one of his vassals, Sansa has\nevery right to question him publicly. The problem is that\u2019s not how Jon sees\nher. He very distinctly separates Sansa from the rest of his court. And since\nwe already had the \u201cwe need to trust each other\u201d scene at the end of season 6,\nI think it\u2019s safe to assume that he sees the two of them as a unit that is\nsupposed to be on the same page so the fact that Sansa speaks out against him in\npublic, instead of privately, feels like a betrayal.</p><p>\u00a0There\u2019s also his character and history to consider. Jon has never been\nthe kind of person to take criticism very well, mostly because he\u2019s felt\nunworthy and rejected all his life. And now he\u2019s gone from the Bastard of\nWinterfell to King in the North in the span of a few months. That would leave\njust about anyone feeling uncertain of how much people truly trust their judgement.</p><p>\u00a0However, if there\u2019s one thing you learn sooner or later, is that there\nare two sides to every story. That\u2019s why it\u2019s never a good idea to side with\none party whenever couples fight.</p><p>\u00a0Because if we look at things from Sansa\u2019s perspective, you can see how\nshe might feel dismissed. The fact of the matter is Jon isn\u2019t the world\u2019s\ngreatest communicator and failed to talk his decision over with Sansa before\nannouncing it to the Council, which in turn makes Sansa feel sidelined, hence\nher aggressive snark and Joffrey digs. And we get an explanation of that here:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: He [Ned] was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see\nhow dirty the world really is but father couldn\u2019t protect me and neither can\nyou. So stop trying. </p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Sansa is operating under a false assumption as well. Jon looks at\ntheir argument and feels undermined. Sansa looks at Jon avoiding her counsel\nand thinks that he does it because he sees her as his little sister that is in\nneed of protection.</p><p>\u00a0Now Jon, bless his heart, does try to put Sansa in the little sister\nbox at times but he fails at it miserably, partly because Sansa doesn\u2019t let him\nand partly because what he needs from her is very far removed from what sisters\nusually provide.</p><p>\u00a0So there they are \u2026 two \u201csiblings\u201d stuck on a balcony having a lovers quarrel.\nJust another day at Winterfell.</p><p>\u00a0Which brings us to what I like to call \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>The \u201cD&amp;D screwing with us\u201d\nlayer</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>Why do I say that the writers are screwing with us in this scene?\nWell, because of this:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: Joffery never let anyone question his authority. Do you think\nhe was a good king?</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0There is absolutely no reasonable explanation for why they felt the\nneed to bring Joffery, one of the worst people this show has ever inflicted on us,\nin this conversation. Firstly, because there is no parallel to be drawn between\nJon and Joffery in this situation. For one, if Joffrey was the king here, Alice\nand Ned\u2019s heads would be decorating the walls. They would certainly not have been\nbrought back into the fold which is what Jon has done for them. Secondly, since\nJon is very much talking his head off to Sansa at the moment, it\u2019s pretty obvious\nthat he isn\u2019t above explaining his reactions.</p><p>\u00a0What she says is, honestly, incredibly insulting which is why she\nbacktracks out of it as quickly as the writers would allow:</p><blockquote><p>Jon: Do you think I\u2019m Joffrey?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re as far from Joffrey as anyone I\u2019ve ever met. <i>(all the\nwhile looking extremely guilty) </i></p></blockquote><p>\u00a0If the mention is here in order to clue us in on the fact that Sansa\nviews Jon as something other than her brother, by comparing him to the only\nperson she\u2019s ever had romantic feelings for, there\u2019s again no need for that.\nSeven romantic tropes in one 3-minute scene is more than enough to get that\npoint across.</p><p>\u00a0So why do the writers have her say this? I would argue that this\nmention is in here in order to advance the \u201cdarkSansa\u201d agenda, particularly since\nthis is a scene where Jon says he feels undermined by her twice.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter that Sansa backtracks on the Joffrey fiasco, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter that she tells him she doesn\u2019t want to undermine him, while\ndesperately sighing with loving eyes that she wants him to listen to her. \u00a0The \u201cdarkSansa\u201d idea sticks.</p><p>\u00a0And that\u2019s because the audience support is very much skewed \u00a0in \u00a0Jon\u2019s\nfavor. Being on tumblr, sometimes you forget that the Jonsa fam is very\nmuch the minority and that exclusive Sansa fans are the unicorns of this fandom\n(#love4unicorns). The vast majority of this audience will not look at Jon as\nan unreliable narrator, as every character in this show is, but as the\nultimate authority on how this scene should be viewed.</p><p>\u00a0If he says he feels undermined, then it must be because he\u2019s being\nundermined, which by extension means that Sansa will betray him. And her\nmentioning Joffery only helps to further antagonize the audience against her.</p><p>\u00a0Does that mean the Ds want us to hate Sansa for no particular reason?\nNot really. What they really, really want is to, yet again, beat the \u201cStarkbowl\u201d\nhorse until it expires from exhaustion. And they\u2019re willing to compromise\nemotional development and cut off the audience from essential POVs to achieve\nthat.</p><p>\u00a0In season 6, when they first teased Starkbowl, they did it for\nemotional turmoil. They gave us that beautiful, heart breaking reunion scene\nonly to immediately have Sansa start to be seemingly duplicitous. Because\nwouldn\u2019t it be just so tragic that after Jon found new purpose in\nlife through Sansa and she finally found safety and comfort with someone that\nactually cared for her, she would turn everything on its head and betray him?</p><p>\u00a0In season 7, they wanted to resurrect it because of the Littlefinger\ntwist ending. This little \u201cJoffrey\u201d titbit and the \u201cundermining\u201d conversation\nhelped plant the seeds for it so when Arya (another fan favorite) began\naccusing her of plotting against Jon, the audience would have this early scene\nto fall back on, despite the fact that Sansa continuously supports Jon\u2019s policy\nwhile he\u2019s away and constantly talks about him, to the point where she almost\nsounds like Sam talking about Gilly.</p><p>\u00a0What I\u2019m trying to get at with this example is that the writers are\nnot operating in good faith when telling this story. They will constantly throw\nthings in to tease plot points that never come to pass. I don\u2019t like\nthis narrative choice at all, because it requires being cut off from certain\ncharacters POVs (Jon and Sansa are champions of this in season 7) which in turn\nputs distance between the audience and them, when the core of good storytelling\nto me is seeing characters wrestle with decisions and emotions not off-screen, but\nright before our eyes.</p><p>However, at the very least, what all of this should tell you, is that\nyou should never simply relay on what the\u00a0\u2018explicit\u2019 meaning of a scene is because there\u2019s far more lurking beneath the surface.\u00a0</p>",

I\u2019m afraid I came out\nempty on this one. </p><p>\u00a0However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that whether\nor not you identify this particular line as a trope, the whole exchange between\nthem ticks a lot of romantic tropes off the list as I\u2019ll show below.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0This is one of the things that always bothers me about people calling\nJonsa shippers delusional. Even if Jonsa never becomes canon, it\u2019s very much a\nfact that the writers are playing with romantic expectations in all of their\nscenes. You can\u2019t swing a stick in the direction of these two without one trope\nor another hitting you smack in the face. So at the very least, Jonsa shippers\nare responding to these visual and storytelling devices. Hardly a delusion.</p><p>\u00a0For the interests of this meta I will focus strictly on the tropes\nused in this particular scene, which considering that it\u2019s only 3 minutes long,\nI was shocked to find out is more than 1. For reference, I\u2019m working off the\nlist of romantic tropes found <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes\">here</a> as well as use\nthe explanation they give for each of them. When you have the\ntime, check it out. It\u2019s like an Easter Egg Hunt for Jonsas.</p><p>\u00a0<b>Like an Old Married Couple: </b><i>These two people are very close and tend to\nbicker with each other.</i></p><p>\u00a0This is where I would actually place the \u201cundermine me\u201d line. In fact\nthis is where I would put this entire exchange:</p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: I can\u2019t question your decisions anymore? </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Of course you can but \u2026</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Joffery never let anyone question his authority. Do you think\nhe was a good king?</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0<i>Ahem \u2026 guys, I reeeally don\u2019t\nthink you\u2019re fighting over what you think you\u2019re fighting over. Also can you\nair your dirty married laundry in private? You\u2019re making everyone\nuncomfortable!</i></p><p>\u00a0Now, <b>Like an Old Married Couple</b>\nis usually served with a generous helping of the <b>Belligerent Sexual Tension</b> and/or <b>Unresolved Sexual Tension </b>tropes on the side. Which would explain\nthe seemingly random insert of Joffery in this whole conversation (there\u2019s more\nto it than that but more on that later). I mean doesn\u2019t every girl compare her\nbrother to her ex-boyfriend? Isn\u2019t that a thing that people do all the time?</p><p>\u00a0The thing that is very interesting here is the way these two are\noperating. There\u2019s nothing really sibling-like about this interaction. This is\ntwo partners having a fight.</p><p>\u00a0But this is where it gets interesting.

Every Jonsa scene comes in direct contrast to\nthat. It isn\u2019t the absence of fighting that makes a couple work, it\u2019s them\nbeing able to resolve and move on from a fight that does. And this is where\nthis trope comes in. No matter how hard Jon and Sansa have a go at each other,\nyou are never left in any doubt that they care about one another.</p><p>\u00a0But there\u2019s more \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>Dismissing a Compliment: </b><i>A character doesn\u2019t believe something nice\ntheir Love Interest tells them.</i></p><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re good at this, you know. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: At what?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: At ruling.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: No \u2026</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You are.

Is it any small wonder this might seem familiar to\npeople? Either way you want to slice it, you have seen these visual and\nnarrative cues in other stories. Tropes don\u2019t become tropes because no one ever\nused them. </p><p>\u00a0Now I did title this meta \u201cthe infamous undermine me scene\u201d for a\nreason. That\u2019s because this scene, as almost all Jonsa scenes, has three layers\nthat are all thrown at the audience simultaneously. Two of these layers are\ngood, one of these layers is BAD. Let\u2019s see if you guess which is which:</p><p>\u00a0<b>What the characters are\nfighting about</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>This is where the whole text vs. subtext analysis comes in. Ideally,\nany scene in any story you ever read or watch, should have both a surface level\nas well as subtext. Now and again you will get scenes, out of necessity, that\nare simply what they say on the tin but writers are actively dissuaded from\ndoing this on the whole. It would be very boring and frankly poor storytelling\nif subtext was non-existent and people simply talked at each other, complete\nwith an accurate, objective narrative on what they\u2019re saying and why they\u2019re\nsaying it. To put it simply, it wouldn\u2019t be a satisfying journey for the\naudience.</p><p>\u00a0So what is the surface level? Well, this is a direct follow-up to the preceding\nscene where Jon pardons Alice and Ned and Sansa argues against it. The argument\ngot pretty heated between the two of them so now we\u2019re given a scene where we\ncan see the resolution of said argument.</p><p>\u00a0What you should keep in mind at this stage is how that argument ended:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families\nof the men who died fighting for you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: [\u2026] I will not punish a son for his father\u2019s sins and I will not\ntake a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is\nmy decision and my decision is final. </p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Check-mate, as they say. Jon won that argument. He is the king and he\nmade his decision. Case closed. On a purely surface level, that argument was\nfinalized. We didn\u2019t really need the \u201cundermine me\u201d scene unless we attempt to\ninfer things that are no presented to us directly.</p><p>\u00a0Which brings us to \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>What the characters are really fighting about</b></p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0The question here is why does Jon feel undermined? I think the answer\nis not because he doesn\u2019t want Sansa questioning his decisions, as she seems to\nbelieve. Nor is it because he suspects some sort of nefarious ulterior motive\n(we\u2019ll leave that for that pesky 3<sup>rd</sup> layer we\u2019ll talk about shortly).</p><p>\u00a0We all know Jon values dialogue\nand collaboration. What we also know is that whatever Sansa says affects him\nvery deeply. You can deduce this from their scenes but, for confirmation, we\nalso have Kit saying that Sansa \u201ctwists\u201d Jon. So we can assume that their\nargument hurts him in some way and even though he put his foot down during the\nmeeting, he still feels the need to clarify the issue with her which is why\nthey\u2019re having the conversation.</p><p>\u00a0Now people have pointed out that, as one of his vassals, Sansa has\nevery right to question him publicly. The problem is that\u2019s not how Jon sees\nher. He very distinctly separates Sansa from the rest of his court. And since\nwe already had the \u201cwe need to trust each other\u201d scene at the end of season 6,\nI think it\u2019s safe to assume that he sees the two of them as a unit that is\nsupposed to be on the same page so the fact that Sansa speaks out against him in\npublic, instead of privately, feels like a betrayal.</p><p>\u00a0There\u2019s also his character and history to consider. Jon has never been\nthe kind of person to take criticism very well, mostly because he\u2019s felt\nunworthy and rejected all his life. And now he\u2019s gone from the Bastard of\nWinterfell to King in the North in the span of a few months. That would leave\njust about anyone feeling uncertain of how much people truly trust their judgement.</p><p>\u00a0However, if there\u2019s one thing you learn sooner or later, is that there\nare two sides to every story. That\u2019s why it\u2019s never a good idea to side with\none party whenever couples fight.</p><p>\u00a0Because if we look at things from Sansa\u2019s perspective, you can see how\nshe might feel dismissed. The fact of the matter is Jon isn\u2019t the world\u2019s\ngreatest communicator and failed to talk his decision over with Sansa before\nannouncing it to the Council, which in turn makes Sansa feel sidelined, hence\nher aggressive snark and Joffrey digs. And we get an explanation of that here:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: He [Ned] was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see\nhow dirty the world really is but father couldn\u2019t protect me and neither can\nyou. So stop trying. </p></blockquote><p>\u00a0Sansa is operating under a false assumption as well. Jon looks at\ntheir argument and feels undermined. Sansa looks at Jon avoiding her counsel\nand thinks that he does it because he sees her as his little sister that is in\nneed of protection.</p><p>\u00a0Now Jon, bless his heart, does try to put Sansa in the little sister\nbox at times but he fails at it miserably, partly because Sansa doesn\u2019t let him\nand partly because what he needs from her is very far removed from what sisters\nusually provide.</p><p>\u00a0So there they are \u2026 two \u201csiblings\u201d stuck on a balcony having a lovers quarrel.\nJust another day at Winterfell.</p><p>\u00a0Which brings us to what I like to call \u2026</p><p>\u00a0<b>The \u201cD&amp;D screwing with us\u201d\nlayer</b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>Why do I say that the writers are screwing with us in this scene?\nWell, because of this:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: Joffery never let anyone question his authority. Do you think\nhe was a good king?</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0There is absolutely no reasonable explanation for why they felt the\nneed to bring Joffery, one of the worst people this show has ever inflicted on us,\nin this conversation. Firstly, because there is no parallel to be drawn between\nJon and Joffery in this situation. For one, if Joffrey was the king here, Alice\nand Ned\u2019s heads would be decorating the walls. They would certainly not have been\nbrought back into the fold which is what Jon has done for them. Secondly, since\nJon is very much talking his head off to Sansa at the moment, it\u2019s pretty obvious\nthat he isn\u2019t above explaining his reactions.</p><p>\u00a0What she says is, honestly, incredibly insulting which is why she\nbacktracks out of it as quickly as the writers would allow:</p><blockquote><p>Jon: Do you think I\u2019m Joffrey?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You\u2019re as far from Joffrey as anyone I\u2019ve ever met. <i>(all the\nwhile looking extremely guilty) </i></p></blockquote><p>\u00a0If the mention is here in order to clue us in on the fact that Sansa\nviews Jon as something other than her brother, by comparing him to the only\nperson she\u2019s ever had romantic feelings for, there\u2019s again no need for that.\nSeven romantic tropes in one 3-minute scene is more than enough to get that\npoint across.</p><p>\u00a0So why do the writers have her say this? I would argue that this\nmention is in here in order to advance the \u201cdarkSansa\u201d agenda, particularly since\nthis is a scene where Jon says he feels undermined by her twice.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter that Sansa backtracks on the Joffrey fiasco, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter that she tells him she doesn\u2019t want to undermine him, while\ndesperately sighing with loving eyes that she wants him to listen to her. \u00a0The \u201cdarkSansa\u201d idea sticks.</p><p>\u00a0And that\u2019s because the audience support is very much skewed \u00a0in \u00a0Jon\u2019s\nfavor. Being on tumblr, sometimes you forget that the Jonsa fam is very\nmuch the minority and that exclusive Sansa fans are the unicorns of this fandom\n(#love4unicorns). The vast majority of this audience will not look at Jon as\nan unreliable narrator, as every character in this show is, but as the\nultimate authority on how this scene should be viewed.</p><p>\u00a0If he says he feels undermined, then it must be because he\u2019s being\nundermined, which by extension means that Sansa will betray him. And her\nmentioning Joffery only helps to further antagonize the audience against her.</p><p>\u00a0Does that mean the Ds want us to hate Sansa for no particular reason?\nNot really. What they really, really want is to, yet again, beat the \u201cStarkbowl\u201d\nhorse until it expires from exhaustion. And they\u2019re willing to compromise\nemotional development and cut off the audience from essential POVs to achieve\nthat.</p><p>\u00a0In season 6, when they first teased Starkbowl, they did it for\nemotional turmoil. They gave us that beautiful, heart breaking reunion scene\nonly to immediately have Sansa start to be seemingly duplicitous. Because\nwouldn\u2019t it be just so tragic that after Jon found new purpose in\nlife through Sansa and she finally found safety and comfort with someone that\nactually cared for her, she would turn everything on its head and betray him?</p><p>\u00a0In season 7, they wanted to resurrect it because of the Littlefinger\ntwist ending. This little \u201cJoffrey\u201d titbit and the \u201cundermining\u201d conversation\nhelped plant the seeds for it so when Arya (another fan favorite) began\naccusing her of plotting against Jon, the audience would have this early scene\nto fall back on, despite the fact that Sansa continuously supports Jon\u2019s policy\nwhile he\u2019s away and constantly talks about him, to the point where she almost\nsounds like Sam talking about Gilly.</p><p>\u00a0What I\u2019m trying to get at with this example is that the writers are\nnot operating in good faith when telling this story. They will constantly throw\nthings in to tease plot points that never come to pass. I don\u2019t like\nthis narrative choice at all, because it requires being cut off from certain\ncharacters POVs (Jon and Sansa are champions of this in season 7) which in turn\nputs distance between the audience and them, when the core of good storytelling\nto me is seeing characters wrestle with decisions and emotions not off-screen, but\nright before our eyes.</p><p>However, at the very least, what all of this should tell you, is that\nyou should never simply relay on what the\u00a0\u2018explicit\u2019 meaning of a scene is because there\u2019s far more lurking beneath the surface.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>About a week ago <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4x_X-QI6QesMTOLt6pcCug\">@jonsa101</a> posted\n<a href=\"https://jonsa101.tumblr.com/post/179011090329/gif-credit-thelawyerthatwaspromised-so-i-saw\">a\nmeta regarding the &ldquo;undermine me&rdquo; scene in season 7</a> (episode 1). </p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>She discusses this particular\nexchange between Jon and Sansa: </p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i>(Sansa Snark is in the house, guys!)</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;In the meta she identifies the &ldquo;undermine me&rdquo; line as a romantic trope\nthat she&rsquo;s seen play out in many different contexts. If you guys haven&rsquo;t read\nthe meta yet, please go and read it. @jonsa101 always has some very interesting\ninterpretations and theories regarding the show and I really enjoy her meta\nwork.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I was already planning on discussing this scene in detail as part of\nmy upcoming series on all the Jonsa scenes but since she tagged me in the meta,\nI thought I&rsquo;d discuss it now.</p><p>I have to say that after reading her post, I had a look at lists of\nromantic tropes as well as my favorite research source &ndash; youtube &ndash; in order to\ntry and find similar examples of the &ldquo;undermine me&rdquo; line. I&rsquo;m afraid I came out\nempty on this one. </p><p>&nbsp;However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that whether\nor not you identify this particular line as a trope, the whole exchange between\nthem ticks a lot of romantic tropes off the list as I&rsquo;ll show below.</p><p>&nbsp;This is one of the things that always bothers me about people calling\nJonsa shippers delusional. Even if Jonsa never becomes canon, it&rsquo;s very much a\nfact that the writers are playing with romantic expectations in all of their\nscenes. You can&rsquo;t swing a stick in the direction of these two without one trope\nor another hitting you smack in the face. So at the very least, Jonsa shippers\nare responding to these visual and storytelling devices. Hardly a delusion.</p><p>&nbsp;For the interests of this meta I will focus strictly on the tropes\nused in this particular scene, which considering that it&rsquo;s only 3 minutes long,\nI was shocked to find out is more than 1. For reference, I&rsquo;m working off the\nlist of romantic tropes found <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes\">here</a> as well as use\nthe explanation they give for each of them. When you have the\ntime, check it out. It&rsquo;s like an Easter Egg Hunt for Jonsas.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Like an Old Married Couple: </b><i>These two people are very close and tend to\nbicker with each other.</i></p><p>&nbsp;This is where I would actually place the &ldquo;undermine me&rdquo; line. In fact\nthis is where I would put this entire exchange:</p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: I can&rsquo;t question your decisions anymore? </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Of course you can but &hellip;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Joffery never let anyone question his authority. Do you think\nhe was a good king?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;<i>Ahem &hellip; guys, I reeeally don&rsquo;t\nthink you&rsquo;re fighting over what you think you&rsquo;re fighting over. Also can you\nair your dirty married laundry in private? You&rsquo;re making everyone\nuncomfortable!</i></p><p>&nbsp;Now, <b>Like an Old Married Couple</b>\nis usually served with a generous helping of the <b>Belligerent Sexual Tension</b> and/or <b>Unresolved Sexual Tension </b>tropes on the side. Which would explain\nthe seemingly random insert of Joffery in this whole conversation (there&rsquo;s more\nto it than that but more on that later). I mean doesn&rsquo;t every girl compare her\nbrother to her ex-boyfriend? Isn&rsquo;t that a thing that people do all the time?</p><p>&nbsp;The thing that is very interesting here is the way these two are\noperating. There&rsquo;s nothing really sibling-like about this interaction. This is\ntwo partners having a fight.</p><p>&nbsp;But this is where it gets interesting. Because this exchange is\nfollowed by another trope:</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Aww, Look! They Really Do Love\nEach Other: </b><i>No matter how much they\nfight, they really do care about each other very much.</i></p><blockquote><p>Jon: You think I&rsquo;m Joffery? </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You&rsquo;re as far from Joffery as anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Thank you!</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Throughout my series on the Jon/D*ny romance (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/176964692831/why-the-jondaenerys-romance-doesnt-work-part-1?is_related_post=1\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177125826726/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-2\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177169140396/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-3\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177459193506/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-4\">X</a>) (<a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/177459554456/why-the-jondany-romance-doesnt-work-part-4\">X</a>), I\nkept talking about how Jon and Dany never seem to reach a consensus or resolve\nanything in any of their fights. Every Jonsa scene comes in direct contrast to\nthat. It isn&rsquo;t the absence of fighting that makes a couple work, it&rsquo;s them\nbeing able to resolve and move on from a fight that does. And this is where\nthis trope comes in. No matter how hard Jon and Sansa have a go at each other,\nyou are never left in any doubt that they care about one another.</p><p>&nbsp;But there&rsquo;s more &hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Dismissing a Compliment: </b><i>A character doesn&rsquo;t believe something nice\ntheir Love Interest tells them.</i></p><blockquote><p>Sansa: You&rsquo;re good at this, you know. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: At what?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: At ruling.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: No &hellip;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You are.

Is it any small wonder this might seem familiar to\npeople? Either way you want to slice it, you have seen these visual and\nnarrative cues in other stories. Tropes don&rsquo;t become tropes because no one ever\nused them. </p><p>&nbsp;Now I did title this meta &ldquo;the infamous undermine me scene&rdquo; for a\nreason. That&rsquo;s because this scene, as almost all Jonsa scenes, has three layers\nthat are all thrown at the audience simultaneously. Two of these layers are\ngood, one of these layers is BAD. Let&rsquo;s see if you guess which is which:</p><p>&nbsp;<b>What the characters are\nfighting about</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>This is where the whole text vs. subtext analysis comes in. Ideally,\nany scene in any story you ever read or watch, should have both a surface level\nas well as subtext. Now and again you will get scenes, out of necessity, that\nare simply what they say on the tin but writers are actively dissuaded from\ndoing this on the whole. It would be very boring and frankly poor storytelling\nif subtext was non-existent and people simply talked at each other, complete\nwith an accurate, objective narrative on what they&rsquo;re saying and why they&rsquo;re\nsaying it. To put it simply, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a satisfying journey for the\naudience.</p><p>&nbsp;So what is the surface level? Well, this is a direct follow-up to the preceding\nscene where Jon pardons Alice and Ned and Sansa argues against it. The argument\ngot pretty heated between the two of them so now we&rsquo;re given a scene where we\ncan see the resolution of said argument.</p><p>&nbsp;What you should keep in mind at this stage is how that argument ended:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families\nof the men who died fighting for you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: [&hellip;] I will not punish a son for his father&rsquo;s sins and I will not\ntake a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is\nmy decision and my decision is final. </p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Check-mate, as they say. Jon won that argument. He is the king and he\nmade his decision. Case closed. On a purely surface level, that argument was\nfinalized. We didn&rsquo;t really need the &ldquo;undermine me&rdquo; scene unless we attempt to\ninfer things that are no presented to us directly.</p><p>&nbsp;Which brings us to &hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;<b>What the characters are really fighting about</b></p><blockquote><p>Jon: You are my sister but I am king now. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: Will you start wearing a crown? <i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and\nladies, you undermine me.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;The question here is why does Jon feel undermined? I think the answer\nis not because he doesn&rsquo;t want Sansa questioning his decisions, as she seems to\nbelieve. Nor is it because he suspects some sort of nefarious ulterior motive\n(we&rsquo;ll leave that for that pesky 3<sup>rd</sup> layer we&rsquo;ll talk about shortly).</p><p>&nbsp;We all know Jon values dialogue\nand collaboration. What we also know is that whatever Sansa says affects him\nvery deeply. You can deduce this from their scenes but, for confirmation, we\nalso have Kit saying that Sansa &ldquo;twists&rdquo; Jon. So we can assume that their\nargument hurts him in some way and even though he put his foot down during the\nmeeting, he still feels the need to clarify the issue with her which is why\nthey&rsquo;re having the conversation.</p><p>&nbsp;Now people have pointed out that, as one of his vassals, Sansa has\nevery right to question him publicly. The problem is that&rsquo;s not how Jon sees\nher. He very distinctly separates Sansa from the rest of his court. And since\nwe already had the &ldquo;we need to trust each other&rdquo; scene at the end of season 6,\nI think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that he sees the two of them as a unit that is\nsupposed to be on the same page so the fact that Sansa speaks out against him in\npublic, instead of privately, feels like a betrayal.</p><p>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s also his character and history to consider. Jon has never been\nthe kind of person to take criticism very well, mostly because he&rsquo;s felt\nunworthy and rejected all his life. And now he&rsquo;s gone from the Bastard of\nWinterfell to King in the North in the span of a few months. That would leave\njust about anyone feeling uncertain of how much people truly trust their judgement.</p><p>&nbsp;However, if there&rsquo;s one thing you learn sooner or later, is that there\nare two sides to every story. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s never a good idea to side with\none party whenever couples fight.</p><p>&nbsp;Because if we look at things from Sansa&rsquo;s perspective, you can see how\nshe might feel dismissed. The fact of the matter is Jon isn&rsquo;t the world&rsquo;s\ngreatest communicator and failed to talk his decision over with Sansa before\nannouncing it to the Council, which in turn makes Sansa feel sidelined, hence\nher aggressive snark and Joffrey digs. And we get an explanation of that here:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: He [Ned] was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see\nhow dirty the world really is but father couldn&rsquo;t protect me and neither can\nyou. So stop trying. </p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Sansa is operating under a false assumption as well. Jon looks at\ntheir argument and feels undermined. Sansa looks at Jon avoiding her counsel\nand thinks that he does it because he sees her as his little sister that is in\nneed of protection.</p><p>&nbsp;Now Jon, bless his heart, does try to put Sansa in the little sister\nbox at times but he fails at it miserably, partly because Sansa doesn&rsquo;t let him\nand partly because what he needs from her is very far removed from what sisters\nusually provide.</p><p>&nbsp;So there they are &hellip; two &ldquo;siblings&rdquo; stuck on a balcony having a lovers quarrel.\nJust another day at Winterfell.</p><p>&nbsp;Which brings us to what I like to call &hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;<b>The &ldquo;D&amp;D screwing with us&rdquo;\nlayer</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Why do I say that the writers are screwing with us in this scene?\nWell, because of this:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: Joffery never let anyone question his authority. Do you think\nhe was a good king?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;There is absolutely no reasonable explanation for why they felt the\nneed to bring Joffery, one of the worst people this show has ever inflicted on us,\nin this conversation. Firstly, because there is no parallel to be drawn between\nJon and Joffery in this situation. For one, if Joffrey was the king here, Alice\nand Ned&rsquo;s heads would be decorating the walls. They would certainly not have been\nbrought back into the fold which is what Jon has done for them. Secondly, since\nJon is very much talking his head off to Sansa at the moment, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious\nthat he isn&rsquo;t above explaining his reactions.</p><p>&nbsp;What she says is, honestly, incredibly insulting which is why she\nbacktracks out of it as quickly as the writers would allow:</p><blockquote><p>Jon: Do you think I&rsquo;m Joffrey?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa: You&rsquo;re as far from Joffrey as anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met. <i>(all the\nwhile looking extremely guilty) </i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;If the mention is here in order to clue us in on the fact that Sansa\nviews Jon as something other than her brother, by comparing him to the only\nperson she&rsquo;s ever had romantic feelings for, there&rsquo;s again no need for that.\nSeven romantic tropes in one 3-minute scene is more than enough to get that\npoint across.</p><p>&nbsp;So why do the writers have her say this? I would argue that this\nmention is in here in order to advance the &ldquo;darkSansa&rdquo; agenda, particularly since\nthis is a scene where Jon says he feels undermined by her twice.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that Sansa backtracks on the Joffrey fiasco, it\ndoesn&rsquo;t matter that she tells him she doesn&rsquo;t want to undermine him, while\ndesperately sighing with loving eyes that she wants him to listen to her. &nbsp;The &ldquo;darkSansa&rdquo; idea sticks.</p><p>&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s because the audience support is very much skewed &nbsp;in &nbsp;Jon&rsquo;s\nfavor. Being on tumblr, sometimes you forget that the Jonsa fam is very\nmuch the minority and that exclusive Sansa fans are the unicorns of this fandom\n(#love4unicorns). The vast majority of this audience will not look at Jon as\nan unreliable narrator, as every character in this show is, but as the\nultimate authority on how this scene should be viewed.</p><p>&nbsp;If he says he feels undermined, then it must be because he&rsquo;s being\nundermined, which by extension means that Sansa will betray him. And her\nmentioning Joffery only helps to further antagonize the audience against her.</p><p>&nbsp;Does that mean the Ds want us to hate Sansa for no particular reason?\nNot really. What they really, really want is to, yet again, beat the &ldquo;Starkbowl&rdquo;\nhorse until it expires from exhaustion. And they&rsquo;re willing to compromise\nemotional development and cut off the audience from essential POVs to achieve\nthat.</p><p>&nbsp;In season 6, when they first teased Starkbowl, they did it for\nemotional turmoil. They gave us that beautiful, heart breaking reunion scene\nonly to immediately have Sansa start to be seemingly duplicitous. Because\nwouldn&rsquo;t it be just so tragic that after Jon found new purpose in\nlife through Sansa and she finally found safety and comfort with someone that\nactually cared for her, she would turn everything on its head and betray him?</p><p>&nbsp;In season 7, they wanted to resurrect it because of the Littlefinger\ntwist ending. This little &ldquo;Joffrey&rdquo; titbit and the &ldquo;undermining&rdquo; conversation\nhelped plant the seeds for it so when Arya (another fan favorite) began\naccusing her of plotting against Jon, the audience would have this early scene\nto fall back on, despite the fact that Sansa continuously supports Jon&rsquo;s policy\nwhile he&rsquo;s away and constantly talks about him, to the point where she almost\nsounds like Sam talking about Gilly.</p><p>&nbsp;What I&rsquo;m trying to get at with this example is that the writers are\nnot operating in good faith when telling this story. They will constantly throw\nthings in to tease plot points that never come to pass. I don&rsquo;t like\nthis narrative choice at all, because it requires being cut off from certain\ncharacters POVs (Jon and Sansa are champions of this in season 7) which in turn\nputs distance between the audience and them, when the core of good storytelling\nto me is seeing characters wrestle with decisions and emotions not off-screen, but\nright before our eyes.</p><p>However, at the very least, what all of this should tell you, is that\nyou should never simply relay on what the&nbsp;&lsquo;explicit&rsquo; meaning of a scene is because there&rsquo;s far more lurking beneath the surface.&nbsp;</p>",
