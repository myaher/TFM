        "body": "<!-- more --><p>Good Evening, Friends. Here\u2019s an update that no one asked for. I continue to feel much, much better. I can credit that to a constant, normalized sleep schedule, a reduction of the constant stress of the last three months and making sure I eat. As far as movement goes that\u2019s exactly what I&rsquo;ve been focusing on. m o v e m e n t. This doesn&rsquo;t mean always going to the gym and slamming weights around, this means moving more intuitively and listening to what I want to do and what I need (without putting too much pressure on myself to be rigid with set demands). Some days I take my dog with me to the park while I do outdoor yoga (in preparation for my outdoor classes I always do in the summer). Sometimes I meet up with a friend and hit the trails for an easy run. Sometimes, doing \u201cnothing\u201d is more important and takes precedence. (If you don&rsquo;t want to read this all skip down to the bottom for a lil story I guarantee you\u2019ll want to read.)</p><p>Habits/personal: Every morning make it a point to tell myself\u00a0I&rsquo;m going to stay present today. That\u2019s my goal. To stay present and take advantage of every moment, and yes, it comes down to actively monitoring my habits. Even things like social media and electronic use impacts us and none of us were given a manual on how to navigate this shifting terrain. So yeah, reading an actual book before bed and shutting down devices actually does make a difference on our mind and body. Sometimes, we have to set rules for ourselves depending on our lives and how we know we respond to things like this. I\u2019m starting a gratitude journal too so that\u2019ll be new journey for me\u00a0(it\u2019s scientifically proven to lower inflammation in the body). My life is starting to go back to\u00a0\u201cnormal\u201d, finally. I was under intense life stressors for a few months.\u00a0</p><h2>Training:\u00a0</h2><p>I\u2019ve done some easy trail runs with my friend (the one who was my old gym partner). His training is ramping up significantly and mine is just now recovering so\u00a0I&rsquo;ve only been joining him on his easy recovery runs. The first one I did, my legs felt like <b>two ton bricks</b>. It felt like I was running through jello. I\u2019m not embarrassed to say\u00a0it was just awful. Consider that I spent since October not putting an emphasis on cardio (only <i>some</i> conditioning), so yeah not surprising. The good news is, it only sucks for a little bit and then it gets better. I mean, each run I do\u00a0I&rsquo;ll never have to redo again lmao. I hate treadmill running unless\u00a0I&rsquo;m doing sprints. I always choose outdoor if I can. I haven&rsquo;t done any major strength training and I\u2019ve probably lost a lot of strength but\u00a0I&rsquo;m not worried about it. Muscle has a memory. I\u2019m ready to pick up some strength training again but my goals right now are more geared towards movement and cardio (so the strength training will be to support that). And of course, yoga. I love doing more and more of it. It just makes you feel so damn good. <b>Plan:</b> adding cardio in 4 times weekly. Alternating between cycling, running, trail running, moderate intensity and intervals. Finishing with a handful of lifting exercises a couple times a week to stay strong.\u00a0</p><h2>Nutrition:</h2><p>Like I mentioned, I am making sure to eat. And haven&rsquo;t been too strict about it, like, at all. I\u2019ve been fueling on pb&amp;j\u2019s. (Side note: I am always making sure I keep my caffeine intake low, I feel better without it. I do half-caff coffee mostly.) I\u2019m increasing my workouts since\u00a0I&rsquo;m feeling good so my nutrition is going to be shifted to support those goals. I don&rsquo;t want be too extreme so\u00a0I&rsquo;ll be following an 80/20 diet. 80% clean Whole Foods and 20% Oreos and Snickers (jk). A major pitfall of mine is failing to prepare to have food when I need it. This week, and for the following weeks, I&rsquo;m meal prepping everything (which I should be doing anyways *glares* @ me). I\u2019m sticking to whole, \u201cclean\u201d foods and following basic nutrition principles. I\u2019m 100% sure you can make progress on nearly any \u201cdiet\u201d as long as you follow nutritional fundamentals.\u00a0I feel better when I eat better anyways. Sometimes we have to go back to basics. Foundations are what we build everything on and any tweaks we do to that foundation are just the\u00a0\u201cfluff\u201d on top. Don\u2019t want that foundation to have cracks in it, do we?\u00a0(SO this week I made a homemade Mac and cheese. Most times I burn everything but sometimes my attempts are a slam dunk. I made my own cheese sauce and used half noodles and half shredded cauliflower to increase the volume and MAN IT WAS BOMB. YOU GOTTA TRY IT. YOU COULDNT EVEN TELL THERE WAS CAULIFLOWER IN IT. Sneaky vegetables.) Unfortunately,\u00a0I&rsquo;ll have to cut out the Mac &amp; cheese and pb&amp;j\u2019s BUT if it\u2019s the weekend and I want a bagel,\u00a0I&rsquo;m gonna have a bagel (80/20 ok). I\u2019m prepping things like grass fed beef, vegetables and sweet potates or rice etc (yes, its po<i>tates</i>).\u00a0</p><h2>Other (friends/lifestyle/inspo):</h2><p>So I got a call from my gym buddy this week which I did not expect. When he started working out with me in January(?) he was what you would call\u00a0\u201cskinny-fat\u201d, which is defined as not looking overweight but also not having any distinguishable muscle tone. Since then he\u2019s put some serious size and strength and totally upped his cardio game. I started him out on some basic training and knowledge and then he continued on his own. When he called me he told me a man approached him in the gym and asked what he was training for. He told him he was training for an iron man (his overall bucket list goal). This is a hefty goal considering he started at ground <i>zero.</i> BUT everyone starts at zero and he is young and you won\u2019t see me telling him he <b>can\u2019t</b> do it. You can do anything you put your mind to. My friend told the guy about how he went down to 135 pounds at his thinnest (dude is like over 6 feet tall) and then went up 65 pounds at his heaviest. Well, they got to talking and this man started telling him about his friends going through BUDS training (SEAL training). And, my friend spilled the beans. He told him that he hadn&rsquo;t told anyone yet but his overall goal was to go out for the Seals. Yeah, aggressive goal. Thats when the guy told him he was special forces (ranger). He told him David Goggins was headed through town and they were all going to dinner with him. Yeah, I know, sounds odd. Anyways, this guy told him that the only difference between him and the ones that made it, was that now it was his turn to do it. That\u2019s it. (Pretty crazy considering like 6% of people that go out for this pass). So my friend told him he\u00a0\u201cdidn\u2019t know anyone\u201d. The guy told him that there were a ton of special forces in this area but they don\u2019t tell you they are unless they want you to know. But, my dude meant he quite <i>literally</i> <b><i>didn\u2019t. know. anyone</i>.</b> He had lost all his friends when he found out they had different priorities and pretty much has no one around him supporting him on this, which is why he called me when he was astounded this happened. Serendipity, I guess. Put your goals out there into the world with iron conviction and the universe will find a way to meet you halfway. So this guy was 38 I think and didn\u2019t look his age (not that 38 is old..) and told dude that he could probably smoke everyone in this gym and well, he could, based on the workouts he was doing. My friend\u2019s jaw was on the floor with this whole interaction. He told me he was nervous and stumbling over his words and felt like he probably made an ass of himself. He apologized for it, saying he barely got any sleep and was super stressed and the guy said\u00a0\u201cWho gets sleep? And we\u2019re all stressed.\u201d The guy offered his advice and networking anytime dude sees him in the gym etc.\u00a0</p><p>We all come from somewhere, we all have dark, broken histories, large goals, even larger struggles etc and feel like our lives consist of constantly trying to pull it together until the day we die but, I swear, you gotta find a way to believe in yourself and even accept your failures. Whats the worst that could happen? You die trying? At least you followed your heart. Just like this dude, out of shape, stumbling, mad at himself because of slow progress but just look back three or four months&hellip; He\u2019s strong now and the progress happened because he was patient with himself and didn\u2019t give up even when he felt like it and he\u2019s still not done. More power to him and anyone willing to try. <b>Perhaps the overall goal doesn&rsquo;t matter as much as who we become in the act of trying</b>\u00a0(thank you Kaylo Littlejohn for that quote). Most times, people just need a positive push in the right direction. Maybe we can focus a little bit more on uplifting and being positive because that shit is contagious.\u00a0</p>",

He told him that he hadn\u2019t told anyone yet but his overall goal was to go out for the Seals. Yeah, aggressive goal. Thats when the guy told him he was special forces (ranger). He told him David Goggins was headed through town and they were all going to dinner with him. Yeah, I know, sounds odd. Anyways, this guy told him that the only difference between him and the ones that made it, was that now it was his turn to do it. That\u2019s it. (Pretty crazy considering like 6% of people that go out for this pass). So my friend told him he\u00a0\u201cdidn\u2019t know anyone\u201d. The guy told him that there were a ton of special forces in this area but they don\u2019t tell you they are unless they want you to know. But, my dude meant he quite <i>literally</i> <b><i>didn\u2019t. know. anyone</i>.</b> He had lost all his friends when he found out they had different priorities and pretty much has no one around him supporting him on this, which is why he called me when he was astounded this happened. Serendipity, I guess. Put your goals out there into the world with iron conviction and the universe will find a way to meet you halfway. So this guy was 38 I think and didn\u2019t look his age (not that 38 is old..) and told dude that he could probably smoke everyone in this gym and well, he could, based on the workouts he was doing. My friend\u2019s jaw was on the floor with this whole interaction. He told me he was nervous and stumbling over his words and felt like he probably made an ass of himself. He apologized for it, saying he barely got any sleep and was super stressed and the guy said\u00a0\u201cWho gets sleep? And we\u2019re all stressed.\u201d The guy offered his advice and networking anytime dude sees him in the gym etc.\u00a0</p><p>We all come from somewhere, we all have dark, broken histories, large goals, even larger struggles etc and feel like our lives consist of constantly trying to pull it together until the day we die but, I swear, you gotta find a way to believe in yourself and even accept your failures. Whats the worst that could happen? You die trying? At least you followed your heart. Just like this dude, out of shape, stumbling, mad at himself because of slow progress but just look back three or four months\u2026 He\u2019s strong now and the progress happened because he was patient with himself and didn\u2019t give up even when he felt like it and he\u2019s still not done. More power to him and anyone willing to try. <b>Perhaps the overall goal doesn\u2019t matter as much as who we become in the act of trying</b>\u00a0(thank you Kaylo Littlejohn for that quote). Most times, people just need a positive push in the right direction. Maybe we can focus a little bit more on uplifting and being positive because that shit is contagious.\u00a0</p></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>[[MORE]]<p>Good Evening, Friends. Here\u2019s an update that no one asked for. I continue to feel much, much better. I can credit that to a constant, normalized sleep schedule, a reduction of the constant stress of the last three months and making sure I eat. As far as movement goes that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been focusing on. m o v e m e n t. This doesn\u2019t mean always going to the gym and slamming weights around, this means moving more intuitively and listening to what I want to do and what I need (without putting too much pressure on myself to be rigid with set demands). Some days I take my dog with me to the park while I do outdoor yoga (in preparation for my outdoor classes I always do in the summer). Sometimes I meet up with a friend and hit the trails for an easy run. Sometimes, doing \u201cnothing\u201d is more important and takes precedence. (If you don\u2019t want to read this all skip down to the bottom for a lil story I guarantee you\u2019ll want to read.)</p><p>Habits/personal: Every morning make it a point to tell myself\u00a0I\u2019m going to stay present today. That\u2019s my goal. To stay present and take advantage of every moment, and yes, it comes down to actively monitoring my habits. Even things like social media and electronic use impacts us and none of us were given a manual on how to navigate this shifting terrain. So yeah, reading an actual book before bed and shutting down devices actually does make a difference on our mind and body. Sometimes, we have to set rules for ourselves depending on our lives and how we know we respond to things like this. I\u2019m starting a gratitude journal too so that\u2019ll be new journey for me\u00a0(it\u2019s scientifically proven to lower inflammation in the body). My life is starting to go back to\u00a0\u201cnormal\u201d, finally. I was under intense life stressors for a few months.\u00a0</p><h2>Training:\u00a0</h2><p>I\u2019ve done some easy trail runs with my friend (the one who was my old gym partner). His training is ramping up significantly and mine is just now recovering so\u00a0I\u2019ve only been joining him on his easy recovery runs. The first one I did, my legs felt like <b>two ton bricks</b>. It felt like I was running through jello. I\u2019m not embarrassed to say\u00a0it was just awful. Consider that I spent since October not putting an emphasis on cardio (only <i>some</i> conditioning), so yeah not surprising. The good news is, it only sucks for a little bit and then it gets better. I mean, each run I do\u00a0I\u2019ll never have to redo again lmao. I hate treadmill running unless\u00a0I\u2019m doing sprints. I always choose outdoor if I can. I haven\u2019t done any major strength training and I\u2019ve probably lost a lot of strength but\u00a0I\u2019m not worried about it. Muscle has a memory. I\u2019m ready to pick up some strength training again but my goals right now are more geared towards movement and cardio (so the strength training will be to support that). And of course, yoga. I love doing more and more of it. It just makes you feel so damn good. <b>Plan:</b> adding cardio in 4 times weekly. Alternating between cycling, running, trail running, moderate intensity and intervals. Finishing with a handful of lifting exercises a couple times a week to stay strong.\u00a0</p><h2>Nutrition:</h2><p>Like I mentioned, I am making sure to eat. And haven\u2019t been too strict about it, like, at all. I\u2019ve been fueling on pb&amp;j\u2019s. (Side note: I am always making sure I keep my caffeine intake low, I feel better without it. I do half-caff coffee mostly.) I\u2019m increasing my workouts since\u00a0I\u2019m feeling good so my nutrition is going to be shifted to support those goals. I don\u2019t want be too extreme so\u00a0I\u2019ll be following an 80/20 diet. 80% clean Whole Foods and 20% Oreos and Snickers (jk). A major pitfall of mine is failing to prepare to have food when I need it. This week, and for the following weeks, I\u2019m meal prepping everything (which I should be doing anyways *glares* @ me). I\u2019m sticking to whole, \u201cclean\u201d foods and following basic nutrition principles. I\u2019m 100% sure you can make progress on nearly any \u201cdiet\u201d as long as you follow nutritional fundamentals.\u00a0I feel better when I eat better anyways. Sometimes we have to go back to basics. Foundations are what we build everything on and any tweaks we do to that foundation are just the\u00a0\u201cfluff\u201d on top. Don\u2019t want that foundation to have cracks in it, do we?\u00a0(SO this week I made a homemade Mac and cheese. Most times I burn everything but sometimes my attempts are a slam dunk. I made my own cheese sauce and used half noodles and half shredded cauliflower to increase the volume and MAN IT WAS BOMB. YOU GOTTA TRY IT. YOU COULDNT EVEN TELL THERE WAS CAULIFLOWER IN IT. Sneaky vegetables.) Unfortunately,\u00a0I\u2019ll have to cut out the Mac &amp; cheese and pb&amp;j\u2019s BUT if it\u2019s the weekend and I want a bagel,\u00a0I\u2019m gonna have a bagel (80/20 ok). I\u2019m prepping things like grass fed beef, vegetables and sweet potates or rice etc (yes, its po<i>tates</i>).\u00a0</p><h2>Other (friends/lifestyle/inspo):</h2><p>So I got a call from my gym buddy this week which I did not expect. When he started working out with me in January(?) he was what you would call\u00a0\u201cskinny-fat\u201d, which is defined as not looking overweight but also not having any distinguishable muscle tone. Since then he\u2019s put some serious size and strength and totally upped his cardio game. I started him out on some basic training and knowledge and then he continued on his own. When he called me he told me a man approached him in the gym and asked what he was training for. He told him he was training for an iron man (his overall bucket list goal). This is a hefty goal considering he started at ground <i>zero.</i> BUT everyone starts at zero and he is young and you won\u2019t see me telling him he <b>can\u2019t</b> do it. You can do anything you put your mind to. My friend told the guy about how he went down to 135 pounds at his thinnest (dude is like over 6 feet tall) and then went up 65 pounds at his heaviest. Well, they got to talking and this man started telling him about his friends going through BUDS training (SEAL training). And, my friend spilled the beans. He told him that he hadn\u2019t told anyone yet but his overall goal was to go out for the Seals. Yeah, aggressive goal. Thats when the guy told him he was special forces (ranger). He told him David Goggins was headed through town and they were all going to dinner with him. Yeah, I know, sounds odd. Anyways, this guy told him that the only difference between him and the ones that made it, was that now it was his turn to do it. That\u2019s it. (Pretty crazy considering like 6% of people that go out for this pass). So my friend told him he\u00a0\u201cdidn\u2019t know anyone\u201d.

Serendipity, I guess. Put your goals out there into the world with iron conviction and the universe will find a way to meet you halfway. So this guy was 38 I think and didn\u2019t look his age (not that 38 is old..) and told dude that he could probably smoke everyone in this gym and well, he could, based on the workouts he was doing. My friend\u2019s jaw was on the floor with this whole interaction. He told me he was nervous and stumbling over his words and felt like he probably made an ass of himself. He apologized for it, saying he barely got any sleep and was super stressed and the guy said\u00a0\u201cWho gets sleep? And we\u2019re all stressed.\u201d The guy offered his advice and networking anytime dude sees him in the gym etc.\u00a0</p><p>We all come from somewhere, we all have dark, broken histories, large goals, even larger struggles etc and feel like our lives consist of constantly trying to pull it together until the day we die but, I swear, you gotta find a way to believe in yourself and even accept your failures.
