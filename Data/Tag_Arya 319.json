They swim naked in the \nriver, right beneath the castle.\u201d \u2013Robert, AGOT, Eddard I</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>\nShe found herself standing at the mouth of a sewer where it emptied into\n the river. She stank so badly that she stripped right there, dropping \nher soiled clothing on the riverbank as she dove into the deep black \nwaters. She swam until she felt clean, and crawled out shivering.\n Some riders went past along the river road as Arya was washing her \nclothes, but if they saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing her rags in \nthe moonlight, they took no notice.\u00a0\n \u2013AGOT, Arya III</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>\nLommy and Tarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, \u201cMud Pie!

Ripples were\n running across the surface of the water when they arrived, making the \nreflection of the weirwood shimmer and dance. There was no wind, though.\n For an instant Bran was baffled.<br/>And then Osha exploded up out of the pool with a great splash, so \nsudden that even Summer leapt back, snarling. Hodor jumped away, wailing\n \u201cHodor, Hodor\u201d in dismay until Bran patted his shoulder to soothe his \nfears. \u201cHow can you swim in there?\u201d he asked Osha. \u201cIsn\u2019t it cold?\u201d<br/>\u201cAs a babe I suckled on icicles, boy. I like\n the cold.\u201d Osha swam to the rocks and rose dripping. She was naked, her\n skin bumpy with gooseprickles. \n Summer crept close and sniffed at her. \u201cI wanted to touch the bottom.\u201d<br/>\u201cI never knew there was a bottom.\u201d<br/>\u201cMight be there isn\u2019t.\u201d She grinned. \u201cWhat are you staring at, boy? Never seen a woman before?\u201d\n\n<br/>\n\u201cI have so.\u201d Bran had bathed with his sisters hundreds of times and he\u2019d seen serving women in the hot pools too. \n\n<br/></small></p><p><small>\u2013ACOK, Bran II</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>\nTo the east, Gods Eye was a sheet of sun-hammered blue that filled half \nthe world. Some days, as they made their slow way up the muddy shore \n(Gendry wanted no part of any roads, and even Hot Pie and Lommy saw the \nsense in that), Arya felt as though the lake were calling her.

Sometimes they wear clothes, but more often they don&rsquo;t.</p><blockquote><p>\n <small>&ldquo;And the girls, Ned!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \n&ldquo;I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the \nriver, right beneath the castle.&rdquo; &ndash;Robert, AGOT, Eddard I</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>\nShe found herself standing at the mouth of a sewer where it emptied into\n the river. She stank so badly that she stripped right there, dropping \nher soiled clothing on the riverbank as she dove into the deep black \nwaters. She swam until she felt clean, and crawled out shivering.\n Some riders went past along the river road as Arya was washing her \nclothes, but if they saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing her rags in \nthe moonlight, they took no notice.&nbsp;\n &ndash;AGOT, Arya III</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>\nLommy and Tarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, &ldquo;Mud Pie!

Ripples were\n running across the surface of the water when they arrived, making the \nreflection of the weirwood shimmer and dance. There was no wind, though.\n For an instant Bran was baffled.<br />And then Osha exploded up out of the pool with a great splash, so \nsudden that even Summer leapt back, snarling. Hodor jumped away, wailing\n &ldquo;Hodor, Hodor&rdquo; in dismay until Bran patted his shoulder to soothe his \nfears. &ldquo;How can you swim in there?&rdquo; he asked Osha. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cold?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;As a babe I suckled on icicles, boy. I like\n the cold.&rdquo; Osha swam to the rocks and rose dripping. She was naked, her\n skin bumpy with gooseprickles. \n Summer crept close and sniffed at her. &ldquo;I wanted to touch the bottom.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I never knew there was a bottom.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Might be there isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She grinned. &ldquo;What are you staring at, boy? Never seen a woman before?&rdquo;\n\n<br />\n&ldquo;I have so.&rdquo; Bran had bathed with his sisters hundreds of times and he&rsquo;d seen serving women in the hot pools too. \n\n<br /></small></p><p><small>&ndash;ACOK, Bran II</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><small>\nTo the east, Gods Eye was a sheet of sun-hammered blue that filled half \nthe world. Some days, as they made their slow way up the muddy shore \n(Gendry wanted no part of any roads, and even Hot Pie and Lommy saw the \nsense in that), Arya felt as though the lake were calling her. She \nwanted to leap into those placid blue waters, to feel clean again, to swim and splash and bask in the sun. But she dare not take off her clothes where the others could see, not even to wash them.\n\n&ndash;ACOK, Arya V</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n<small>&ldquo;The gods will take me when they see fit,&rdquo; Septon Chayle said quietly, \n&ldquo;though I scarcely think it likely that I&rsquo;ll drown, Bran.
