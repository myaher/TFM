His arms tightened around you as he took a few steps\nback to the island counter in the middle of the kitchen and sitting you down on\nit. \u00a0Another gasp left your mouth as the\ndress you wore, rode up a bit and the bare skin of your thighs meet the cool\ngranite of the counter top. </p><p>Harry took it as the perfect opportunity to slip his\ntongue into your mouth, one hand gripping the material of you dress while the\nother came up to lock tightly into your hair. Your chest rose heavily as you\ntried to pull in air past his heavy kiss. </p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he breathed heavily, hand still tight in\nyour hair. \u201cAll I want for Christmas is you. Fuck the cookies.\u201d</p><p>Smirking he leant back in, lips colliding with yours. His\nhot hands grabbed your thighs, pulling them up to wrap around his hips instead of\nallowing them to dangle off the counter edge. His hands continued to slide up\nyour thighs, thumbs catching over the hem of your dress to push it up over your\nhips.</p><p>Panting, you pulled back from him, arms raising so he\ncould get your dress over your head. It was times like this you were very\ngrateful for the heater in your house and watching Harry\u2019s eye lids drop along\nwith his jaw you were also very grateful for your recent purchase. </p><p>\u201cFuck me?\u201d He whispered, biting his already swollen lip. \u201cWhen\ndid you get that?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s fingers that had been digging divots into your hips\nraised carefully, slowly as if he moved to fast then you would disappear from\nright in front of him. </p><p>\u201cFew days ago, Merry Christmas baby.\u201d You said, trying to\ncatch your breath.</p><p>Gingerly Harry\u2019s fingers moved over the lace edge of the\nred bra before moving down, knuckle circling around your nipple before cupping\nyour breast and feeling all the small lace and sparkle details of the bra. Meeting\nyour eyes for a short second he moved his finger to slide down your stomach\nbefore toying with the band of the red thong that was even more transparent\nthen the bra. </p><p>\u201cThank you.

You and Harry are quiet as you walk side by side towards his gate, and you can\u2019t help but think of how this silence is a very rare occurrence between you and your boyfriend of <i>almost\u00a0</i>two years; however, it seems fitting with the fact that he\u2019s leaving for LA\u2026 Again. </p><p>You could\u2019ve sworn that he just got back to London\u2014and as you think back to him coming home shortly after Halloween your thoughts prove to be right seeing as here the two of you are preparing for his departure once again after just over a month of being in the same country together. It\u2019s not his fault and you know that, but that doesn\u2019t mean each time the two of you find yourselves in this same predicament it gets any easier; it\u2019s quite the opposite actually. </p><p>About two weeks into Harry being home again is when he decided to announce that he had to return to California during the first week of December, along with the awesome news that he would be unable to make it back for Christmas due to the busy schedule and workload he had waiting for him. You didn\u2019t take the news lightly and it resulted in a bit of an argument between the both of you. The fight really didn\u2019t last long\u2014however, it did take a toll on Harry for he felt extremely bad with the thought of leaving you alone for the holidays; all despite you stressing that he really did not need too. But with Harry being Harry, he came up with a unique way of trying to make up for it. </p><p>It all started on the first of December. You were in the midst of groggily waking up after a night of drinking with Harry and some friends after a <i>Bring Me the Horizon\u00a0</i>concert,\u00a0and just as you were reaching over to brush your hand through your boyfriend\u2019s shaggy curls you found the space next to you vacant and a folded note with your name written across it in his place. The subtle pounding in your head from the beginning of your hangover increased as confusion started making itself known, but nonetheless you unfolded the piece of paper and read it aloud. </p><p><i>\u201cOn the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me, some Advil and a cup of tea.\u201d </i></p><p>As if on cue; Harry emerged into the bedroom with a tray full of fresh fruit, pancakes, toast, tea, and Advil to serve you breakfast in bed as a sweet gesture to start off his idea of making up for missing Christmas. This kind of thing continued over the next couple of days where each day he surprised you with something new and you would scold him for it; telling him to knock it off because there was no reason for him to feel bad and do such things for you\u2014yet it didn\u2019t stop there. </p><p>This morning you woke up to him peppering you with kisses, which led to some extremely early morning sex before you were to drive him to the airport; only to be surprised with another note and a full tank of gas when you climbed into the car as his gift for the day. He didn\u2019t say anything as you narrowed your gaze at him while he climbed into the car and just shrugged it off\u2014making a comment of you being the reason for if he were to miss his flight. With a loud scoff from you and a playful smack to his arm, he just chuckled in response; proudly showing off his dimples and winking at you. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have seduced me love, now m\u2019definitely gonna be late.\u201d </p><p>And much to your dismay, you ended up not being late in getting him to the airport and have led yourself to present time\u2026</p><p>\u201cS\u2019my gate petal,\u201d Harry\u2019s deep voice breaks you from your thoughts, and you slowly glance up to see him trying to avoid eye contact. </p><p>A small smile tugs at your lips as you place your hand under his chin and move it, so his enticing green eyes will meet yours instead of the floor. \u201cI love you, and I\u2019m going to miss you H\u2026 really freaking bad.\u201d</p><p>The smile that takes over his pretty mouth is the only response you need as he leans down to meet your lips hungrily in a passionate kiss. Neither of you have the intention of breaking away from the other, but unfortunately as the announcement of his flight preparing to board sounds; you know there isn\u2019t much of a choice in the matter. Once his lips part from yours, he brushes away a stray piece of hair that has fallen in your face and smirks. \u201cGonna miss you even more. Good thing I have all these gifts lined up for you to keep your mind on me and not your other boyfriend though.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Boyfriends </i>actually, there\u2019s more than one,\u201d you correct with a smug grin, and he just laughs. \u201cAnd I told you to quit it with the gifts Harry. How am I supposed to even compete with any of this when I finish putting together your gifts, hmm? You\u2019re making me look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould always take me up on that offer to fly you out to LA so you can come see me,\u201d he suggests all while knowing what your answer will be. </p><p>\u201cAnd you know I would; but work won\u2019t let me have the time off,\u201d you reason, and he nods his head knowingly. He goes to say something but is cut off by the final call for boarding his flight. </p><p>Sadness washes over his features yet again as he pulls you in for a hug and squeezes tightly. \u201cM\u2019sorry I won\u2019t be back but please know you\u2019re all I\u2019ll be thinking about until I can get back in January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know,\u201d you mumble into his chest as you wrap your arms around his middle and move back to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m counting down the days. Also, you need to go now or else you actually will miss your flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, petal,\u201d he states and leans down for one more kiss before finally moving away from your grasp. With one last wink, he slings his carryon bag over his shoulder and makes way to his gate; giving you a small wave before disappearing behind the doors. </p><p>\u2026Your life resumes normally the day after Harry leaves, and staying true to his word; each day after that you one way or another come across a gift and letter from the man of your dreams. </p><p>Some days he gets creative with them, and you\u2019re just left absolutely speechless. One day about a week after he\u2019s gone, you show up to work to find a small rectangular box waiting for you with a note that reads; <i>\u201cOn the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, something to wear from Tiffany.\u201d </i>The look of shock that registers on your face as you open up a simple, yet stunning small heart Tiffany and Co. necklace doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by your coworkers, and they soon become excited to see just what else your famous boyfriend has up his sleeve. </p><p>A couple of days later you\u2019re out getting lunch with Grimmy, who is unable to contain his excitement as he hands you a box with, yet another note attached to it. \u201cC\u2019mon love open it,\u201d he pushes, and he grins widely as you unfold the piece of paper. \u201cRead it out loud.\u201d</p><p>With an eyeroll at his dramatics you bite down on you lip and oblige to his demands. <i>\u201cOn the fifteenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, something to use for when I\u2019m lonely\u2026\u201d </i>You trail off at the end of the note\u2014unsure of what in the hell Harry could\u2019ve meant by writing that. Grimmy looks at you questionably as you unwrap the fancy paper to reveal the box of a vibrator; and waste no time in gasping loudly before hiding the sex toy under the table while Nick dies of laughter. </p><p>Five days later you answer the front door of yours and Harry\u2019s shared home to be met by a mailman with a package addressed to you. After thanking the man, you take the package into the kitchen and allow your mind to imagine what it could possibly contain once you see the package was sent from Harry\u2019s home in LA. Excitement and worry soon takes over you as you open the box to see a flimsy looking wrapped gift, and surprise! Another letter. </p><p><i>\u201cOn the twentieth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a shirt to keep from Stevie,\u201d </i>you read to yourself and can\u2019t help but feel a little puzzled. With a shake of your head, you tear into the wrapping paper and squeal in shock as you let the item fall onto the counter. You quickly dig your cell phone out from your pocket to call Harry and fangirl over the signed Fleetwood Mac shirt he just sent you from the concert he attended a few days ago and try to keep your cool in doing so; but end up failing miserably. </p><p>Harry\u2019s gifts have been so exceptional that you\u2019re literally at a loss of words by how above and beyond he has gone for you\u2014however, there isn\u2019t one day that passes where you open a new gift and think about how you would trade it, along with everything else you\u2019ve received just to have him home with you instead of being alone. You\u2019re not quite used to spending the holidays by yourself, but unfortunately with work it couldn\u2019t be arranged for you to go home and visit your family until after the holidays. So, when Anne and Gemma are kind enough to extend an invitation for you to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with all of Harry\u2019s family, you are more than happy to accept. </p><p>Soon enough Christmas Eve has approached, and you somehow managed to get the day off work\u2014which has led to you spending the entire day with Harry\u2019s relatives at Anne\u2019s home. The day has consisted of lots of food, laughs, and just an all-around good vibe as you get to spend time with some of the people who have been nothing but welcoming to you since the start of your relationship with a certain rock star. </p><p>As the day comes to an end and all the guests leave, you help with tiding everything up before settling onto a couch in the den to watch a Christmas movie with Anne and Gemma before calling it a night. Once the movie is over\u2014you discover that neither you or any of the two women you\u2019re with are tired despite the eventful day you all shared; deciding that stepping out to get some fresh air may help do the trick. </p><p>The three of you bundle up in coats and boots before heading outside into the crisp December air, and you can\u2019t help but smile at the sight of the snow that continues to fall thickly from the sky; really setting the Christmas mood. Anne proposes that you go to a nearby park where all the festive lights will still be on display, and you agree happily; this way the walk will be a bit more scenic and less crowded with it being well into the late hours of the night. </p><p>\u201cSo, Gem, is Michal coming here tomorrow?\u201d You ask Harry\u2019s sister and your friend as you all make way around a corner and the park Anne mentioned comes into view. </p><p>\u201cYeah he is, he should be here in the morning,\u201d she responds with a smile and glances at you sideways. \u201cAny word on when my brother is coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you mutter quietly and look down to your boots as they kick through the freshly fallen snow. \u201cChristmas sure isn\u2019t the same without him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was telling us about all the gifts he\u2019s been sending you from LA,\u201d Anne pipes in and smirks as you move your gaze to her. </p><p>\u201cDid he tell you how much shit I\u2019ve given him every day for doing that?\u201d You ask, suddenly feeling a little defensive over how the framed picture of the two of you, watch, and cologne you ended up buying Harry for Christmas seems like literally nothing compared to what he\u2019s done for you. </p><p>\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t need to. We already knew,\u201d Gemma chuckles and gently nudges you with her elbow. \u201cToo bad you\u2019re dating one of the most extra and stubborn people to ever walk this planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d you mumble; causing both women to laugh. In the distance you hear a clock ding, indicating a new hour has started but also that it is now officially Christmas Day as well. A smile graces your lips as you look at two of the most important women in Harry\u2019s life before wrapping your arms around their shoulders and pulling them in for group hug. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d</p><p>The two of them laugh again before each wrapping an arm around you, and around the other before repeating your words in unison. \u201cMerry Christmas Y/N!\u201d </p><p>After a moment of huddling together, you all break away and that\u2019s when you are finally able to take in the stunning lights that surround you. The different shapes and forms the lights take have you mesmerized for a few minutes before your gaze falls onto a tall lit up Christmas tree further into the park; and are quick in deciding that aspect of it all is your favourite. You smile to yourself before looking back to Anne and Gemma, who are grinning widely at you before giving each other a knowing glance. \u201cW-what? Is the something on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma giggles and glances at her mum again, who just nods. \u201cBut speaking of Christmas Day\u2026 Harry left us in charge of your final gift, so uhm here it is.\u201d She reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out an all too familiar piece of paper that once again has your name scribbled across it in Harry\u2019s distinctive writing.</p><p>You let out a breath and bite down on your lip before reaching for the letter\u2014and reading aloud what it says for one last time. <i>\u201cOn the twenty-fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, turn around and you will see?\u201d</i>The words leave your mouth as a question because this is by far the most confusing note Harry has left you, and you really don\u2019t know what to think of it. </p><p>With an unsure glance at the two women, they both motion for you to turn around and you slowly do as you\u2019re told. Nerves soon take over you, so you quickly shut your eyes before completing a one hundred and eighty degrees turn before slowly opening them again; never being able to prepare yourself for what stands there waiting as you do so. </p><p>A loud gasp escapes your mouth and tears well in your eyes as you\u2019re met by Harry standing there grinning back at you; all bundled up in his winter coat as the snowflakes begin collecting in the curls that stick out from underneath the grey hat he wears. You\u2019re not long in breaking out in a sprint to launch yourself into his waiting arms and engulfing him in the biggest hug you could possibly deliver. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d You ask excitedly as he chuckles at your reaction and returns the tight hug. </p><p>\u201cMade a couple arrangements so you wouldn\u2019t miss me too much,\u201d he explains with a wink. Normally you\u2019d be annoyed with a narcissistic comment like this, but right now you couldn\u2019t care less about it. \u201cDid you like your gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved them,\u201d you state and pull away to glance up at him. \u201cBut this one is by far my favourite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell m\u2019glad I didn\u2019t mess it up,\u201d he replies before bending down to meet your lips and a heated kiss. After a moment he breaks the kiss and smiles down at you affectionately. \u201cMerry Christmas Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas Harry,\u201d you respond and pull him in for another quick peck. </p><p>\u201cAlright you two,\u201d Anne\u2019s voice speaks up, causing the two of you to look over at her and Gem. \u201cIt\u2019s late and we have an early morning ahead of us, so why don\u2019t we head on home, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes mother,\u201d Harry answers her, and she gives him a threatening glance before turning around to lead the way back to the house. You and Harry fall into step together and silence takes over for a moment before he leans down to whisper something into your ear. \u201cHope you brought that vibrator.\u201d</p><p>Another gasp leaves your mouth as he smiles cheekily and sprints towards his mum and sister to avoid your wrath. You roll your eyes at his antics but leave him be as he pulls Anne and Gemma in for a hug; knowing that this is by far one of the best Christmases ever.</p><p><i>Don\u2019t forget to check out all the lovely pieces from everyone else taking part in this: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCqtXGUZzr49ZJD7dCtXCvA\">@tiostyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2L9DimjiwG3MNPQ9fqEzwg\">@harrysonlyangelsss</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkhDPXpIBLhtRTLd9SkfWpw\">@lovemepleaase</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcewlYTGCX5rsEAMHbwtUEg\">@harryswoods</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN2DHjKf5RfKNxLmJ_s8RNQ\">@meet-me-in-the-kitchen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNz7xHI6QYL-FzYSkzJdcjg\">@yeehaw-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc9z2eqUqRfZQSKVCVt7fg\">@pendantstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUv6KB4SkSW0--s3norFBfw\">@faith8993</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mewAbrobBDoNOkOPRdR7rsA\">@himagines</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo0n2Voxoxlypas8KGkrHdQ\">@meetyourmouths</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxbeDiVYKF8-7lyKjGWXUQQ\">@oh-clementine</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnZsGTeRFo4_epK1_hJUlNg\">@hestylesno</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXr1EH6J4biUmmUhGn7AavQ\">@tpwkwrites</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTqOs2OcomcWG97D7gfQXIg\">@itsholyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> hiiiii again friends I\u2019m back</i></p>",

You and Harry are quiet as you walk side by side towards his gate, and you can\u2019t help but think of how this silence is a very rare occurrence between you and your boyfriend of <i>almost\u00a0</i>two years; however, it seems fitting with the fact that he\u2019s leaving for LA\u2026 Again. </p><p>You could\u2019ve sworn that he just got back to London\u2014and as you think back to him coming home shortly after Halloween your thoughts prove to be right seeing as here the two of you are preparing for his departure once again after just over a month of being in the same country together. It\u2019s not his fault and you know that, but that doesn\u2019t mean each time the two of you find yourselves in this same predicament it gets any easier; it\u2019s quite the opposite actually. </p><p>About two weeks into Harry being home again is when he decided to announce that he had to return to California during the first week of December, along with the awesome news that he would be unable to make it back for Christmas due to the busy schedule and workload he had waiting for him. You didn\u2019t take the news lightly and it resulted in a bit of an argument between the both of you. The fight really didn\u2019t last long\u2014however, it did take a toll on Harry for he felt extremely bad with the thought of leaving you alone for the holidays; all despite you stressing that he really did not need too. But with Harry being Harry, he came up with a unique way of trying to make up for it. </p><p>It all started on the first of December. You were in the midst of groggily waking up after a night of drinking with Harry and some friends after a <i>Bring Me the Horizon\u00a0</i>concert,\u00a0and just as you were reaching over to brush your hand through your boyfriend\u2019s shaggy curls you found the space next to you vacant and a folded note with your name written across it in his place. The subtle pounding in your head from the beginning of your hangover increased as confusion started making itself known, but nonetheless you unfolded the piece of paper and read it aloud. </p><p><i>\u201cOn the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me, some Advil and a cup of tea.\u201d </i></p><p>As if on cue; Harry emerged into the bedroom with a tray full of fresh fruit, pancakes, toast, tea, and Advil to serve you breakfast in bed as a sweet gesture to start off his idea of making up for missing Christmas. This kind of thing continued over the next couple of days where each day he surprised you with something new and you would scold him for it; telling him to knock it off because there was no reason for him to feel bad and do such things for you\u2014yet it didn\u2019t stop there. </p><p>This morning you woke up to him peppering you with kisses, which led to some extremely early morning sex before you were to drive him to the airport; only to be surprised with another note and a full tank of gas when you climbed into the car as his gift for the day. He didn\u2019t say anything as you narrowed your gaze at him while he climbed into the car and just shrugged it off\u2014making a comment of you being the reason for if he were to miss his flight. With a loud scoff from you and a playful smack to his arm, he just chuckled in response; proudly showing off his dimples and winking at you. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have seduced me love, now m\u2019definitely gonna be late.\u201d </p><p>And much to your dismay, you ended up not being late in getting him to the airport and have led yourself to present time\u2026</p><p>\u201cS\u2019my gate petal,\u201d Harry\u2019s deep voice breaks you from your thoughts, and you slowly glance up to see him trying to avoid eye contact. </p><p>A small smile tugs at your lips as you place your hand under his chin and move it, so his enticing green eyes will meet yours instead of the floor. \u201cI love you, and I\u2019m going to miss you H\u2026 really freaking bad.\u201d</p><p>The smile that takes over his pretty mouth is the only response you need as he leans down to meet your lips hungrily in a passionate kiss. Neither of you have the intention of breaking away from the other, but unfortunately as the announcement of his flight preparing to board sounds; you know there isn\u2019t much of a choice in the matter. Once his lips part from yours, he brushes away a stray piece of hair that has fallen in your face and smirks. \u201cGonna miss you even more. Good thing I have all these gifts lined up for you to keep your mind on me and not your other boyfriend though.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Boyfriends </i>actually, there\u2019s more than one,\u201d you correct with a smug grin, and he just laughs. \u201cAnd I told you to quit it with the gifts Harry. How am I supposed to even compete with any of this when I finish putting together your gifts, hmm? You\u2019re making me look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould always take me up on that offer to fly you out to LA so you can come see me,\u201d he suggests all while knowing what your answer will be. </p><p>\u201cAnd you know I would; but work won\u2019t let me have the time off,\u201d you reason, and he nods his head knowingly. He goes to say something but is cut off by the final call for boarding his flight. </p><p>Sadness washes over his features yet again as he pulls you in for a hug and squeezes tightly. \u201cM\u2019sorry I won\u2019t be back but please know you\u2019re all I\u2019ll be thinking about until I can get back in January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know,\u201d you mumble into his chest as you wrap your arms around his middle and move back to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m counting down the days. Also, you need to go now or else you actually will miss your flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, petal,\u201d he states and leans down for one more kiss before finally moving away from your grasp. With one last wink, he slings his carryon bag over his shoulder and makes way to his gate; giving you a small wave before disappearing behind the doors. </p><p>\u2026Your life resumes normally the day after Harry leaves, and staying true to his word; each day after that you one way or another come across a gift and letter from the man of your dreams. </p><p>Some days he gets creative with them, and you\u2019re just left absolutely speechless. One day about a week after he\u2019s gone, you show up to work to find a small rectangular box waiting for you with a note that reads; <i>\u201cOn the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, something to wear from Tiffany.\u201d </i>The look of shock that registers on your face as you open up a simple, yet stunning small heart Tiffany and Co. necklace doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by your coworkers, and they soon become excited to see just what else your famous boyfriend has up his sleeve. </p><p>A couple of days later you\u2019re out getting lunch with Grimmy, who is unable to contain his excitement as he hands you a box with, yet another note attached to it. \u201cC\u2019mon love open it,\u201d he pushes, and he grins widely as you unfold the piece of paper. \u201cRead it out loud.\u201d</p><p>With an eyeroll at his dramatics you bite down on you lip and oblige to his demands. <i>\u201cOn the fifteenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, something to use for when I\u2019m lonely\u2026\u201d </i>You trail off at the end of the note\u2014unsure of what in the hell Harry could\u2019ve meant by writing that. Grimmy looks at you questionably as you unwrap the fancy paper to reveal the box of a vibrator; and waste no time in gasping loudly before hiding the sex toy under the table while Nick dies of laughter. </p><p>Five days later you answer the front door of yours and Harry\u2019s shared home to be met by a mailman with a package addressed to you. After thanking the man, you take the package into the kitchen and allow your mind to imagine what it could possibly contain once you see the package was sent from Harry\u2019s home in LA. Excitement and worry soon takes over you as you open the box to see a flimsy looking wrapped gift, and surprise! Another letter. </p><p><i>\u201cOn the twentieth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a shirt to keep from Stevie,\u201d </i>you read to yourself and can\u2019t help but feel a little puzzled. With a shake of your head, you tear into the wrapping paper and squeal in shock as you let the item fall onto the counter. You quickly dig your cell phone out from your pocket to call Harry and fangirl over the signed Fleetwood Mac shirt he just sent you from the concert he attended a few days ago and try to keep your cool in doing so; but end up failing miserably. </p><p>Harry\u2019s gifts have been so exceptional that you\u2019re literally at a loss of words by how above and beyond he has gone for you\u2014however, there isn\u2019t one day that passes where you open a new gift and think about how you would trade it, along with everything else you\u2019ve received just to have him home with you instead of being alone. You\u2019re not quite used to spending the holidays by yourself, but unfortunately with work it couldn\u2019t be arranged for you to go home and visit your family until after the holidays. So, when Anne and Gemma are kind enough to extend an invitation for you to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with all of Harry\u2019s family, you are more than happy to accept. </p><p>Soon enough Christmas Eve has approached, and you somehow managed to get the day off work\u2014which has led to you spending the entire day with Harry\u2019s relatives at Anne\u2019s home. The day has consisted of lots of food, laughs, and just an all-around good vibe as you get to spend time with some of the people who have been nothing but welcoming to you since the start of your relationship with a certain rock star. </p><p>As the day comes to an end and all the guests leave, you help with tiding everything up before settling onto a couch in the den to watch a Christmas movie with Anne and Gemma before calling it a night. Once the movie is over\u2014you discover that neither you or any of the two women you\u2019re with are tired despite the eventful day you all shared; deciding that stepping out to get some fresh air may help do the trick. </p><p>The three of you bundle up in coats and boots before heading outside into the crisp December air, and you can\u2019t help but smile at the sight of the snow that continues to fall thickly from the sky; really setting the Christmas mood. Anne proposes that you go to a nearby park where all the festive lights will still be on display, and you agree happily; this way the walk will be a bit more scenic and less crowded with it being well into the late hours of the night. </p><p>\u201cSo, Gem, is Michal coming here tomorrow?\u201d You ask Harry\u2019s sister and your friend as you all make way around a corner and the park Anne mentioned comes into view. </p><p>\u201cYeah he is, he should be here in the morning,\u201d she responds with a smile and glances at you sideways. \u201cAny word on when my brother is coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you mutter quietly and look down to your boots as they kick through the freshly fallen snow. \u201cChristmas sure isn\u2019t the same without him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was telling us about all the gifts he\u2019s been sending you from LA,\u201d Anne pipes in and smirks as you move your gaze to her. </p><p>\u201cDid he tell you how much shit I\u2019ve given him every day for doing that?\u201d You ask, suddenly feeling a little defensive over how the framed picture of the two of you, watch, and cologne you ended up buying Harry for Christmas seems like literally nothing compared to what he\u2019s done for you. </p><p>\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t need to. We already knew,\u201d Gemma chuckles and gently nudges you with her elbow. \u201cToo bad you\u2019re dating one of the most extra and stubborn people to ever walk this planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d you mumble; causing both women to laugh. In the distance you hear a clock ding, indicating a new hour has started but also that it is now officially Christmas Day as well. A smile graces your lips as you look at two of the most important women in Harry\u2019s life before wrapping your arms around their shoulders and pulling them in for group hug. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d</p><p>The two of them laugh again before each wrapping an arm around you, and around the other before repeating your words in unison. \u201cMerry Christmas Y/N!\u201d </p><p>After a moment of huddling together, you all break away and that\u2019s when you are finally able to take in the stunning lights that surround you. The different shapes and forms the lights take have you mesmerized for a few minutes before your gaze falls onto a tall lit up Christmas tree further into the park; and are quick in deciding that aspect of it all is your favourite. You smile to yourself before looking back to Anne and Gemma, who are grinning widely at you before giving each other a knowing glance. \u201cW-what? Is the something on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma giggles and glances at her mum again, who just nods. \u201cBut speaking of Christmas Day\u2026 Harry left us in charge of your final gift, so uhm here it is.\u201d She reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out an all too familiar piece of paper that once again has your name scribbled across it in Harry\u2019s distinctive writing.</p><p>You let out a breath and bite down on your lip before reaching for the letter\u2014and reading aloud what it says for one last time. <i>\u201cOn the twenty-fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, turn around and you will see?\u201d</i>The words leave your mouth as a question because this is by far the most confusing note Harry has left you, and you really don\u2019t know what to think of it. </p><p>With an unsure glance at the two women, they both motion for you to turn around and you slowly do as you\u2019re told. Nerves soon take over you, so you quickly shut your eyes before completing a one hundred and eighty degrees turn before slowly opening them again; never being able to prepare yourself for what stands there waiting as you do so. </p><p>A loud gasp escapes your mouth and tears well in your eyes as you\u2019re met by Harry standing there grinning back at you; all bundled up in his winter coat as the snowflakes begin collecting in the curls that stick out from underneath the grey hat he wears. You\u2019re not long in breaking out in a sprint to launch yourself into his waiting arms and engulfing him in the biggest hug you could possibly deliver. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d You ask excitedly as he chuckles at your reaction and returns the tight hug. </p><p>\u201cMade a couple arrangements so you wouldn\u2019t miss me too much,\u201d he explains with a wink. Normally you\u2019d be annoyed with a narcissistic comment like this, but right now you couldn\u2019t care less about it. \u201cDid you like your gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved them,\u201d you state and pull away to glance up at him. \u201cBut this one is by far my favourite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell m\u2019glad I didn\u2019t mess it up,\u201d he replies before bending down to meet your lips and a heated kiss. After a moment he breaks the kiss and smiles down at you affectionately. \u201cMerry Christmas Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas Harry,\u201d you respond and pull him in for another quick peck. </p><p>\u201cAlright you two,\u201d Anne\u2019s voice speaks up, causing the two of you to look over at her and Gem. \u201cIt\u2019s late and we have an early morning ahead of us, so why don\u2019t we head on home, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes mother,\u201d Harry answers her, and she gives him a threatening glance before turning around to lead the way back to the house. You and Harry fall into step together and silence takes over for a moment before he leans down to whisper something into your ear. \u201cHope you brought that vibrator.\u201d</p><p>Another gasp leaves your mouth as he smiles cheekily and sprints towards his mum and sister to avoid your wrath. You roll your eyes at his antics but leave him be as he pulls Anne and Gemma in for a hug; knowing that this is by far one of the best Christmases ever.</p><p><i>Don\u2019t forget to check out all the lovely pieces from everyone else taking part in this: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCqtXGUZzr49ZJD7dCtXCvA\">@tiostyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2L9DimjiwG3MNPQ9fqEzwg\">@harrysonlyangelsss</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkhDPXpIBLhtRTLd9SkfWpw\">@lovemepleaase</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcewlYTGCX5rsEAMHbwtUEg\">@harryswoods</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN2DHjKf5RfKNxLmJ_s8RNQ\">@meet-me-in-the-kitchen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNz7xHI6QYL-FzYSkzJdcjg\">@yeehaw-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc9z2eqUqRfZQSKVCVt7fg\">@pendantstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUv6KB4SkSW0--s3norFBfw\">@faith8993</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mewAbrobBDoNOkOPRdR7rsA\">@himagines</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo0n2Voxoxlypas8KGkrHdQ\">@meetyourmouths</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxbeDiVYKF8-7lyKjGWXUQQ\">@oh-clementine</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnZsGTeRFo4_epK1_hJUlNg\">@hestylesno</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXr1EH6J4biUmmUhGn7AavQ\">@tpwkwrites</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTqOs2OcomcWG97D7gfQXIg\">@itsholyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> hiiiii again friends I\u2019m back</i></p></p>",

With a loud scoff from you and a playful smack to his arm, he just chuckled in response; proudly showing off his dimples and winking at you. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have seduced me love, now m\u2019definitely gonna be late.\u201d </p><p>And much to your dismay, you ended up not being late in getting him to the airport and have led yourself to present time\u2026</p><p>\u201cS\u2019my gate petal,\u201d Harry\u2019s deep voice breaks you from your thoughts, and you slowly glance up to see him trying to avoid eye contact. </p><p>A small smile tugs at your lips as you place your hand under his chin and move it, so his enticing green eyes will meet yours instead of the floor. \u201cI love you, and I\u2019m going to miss you H\u2026 really freaking bad.\u201d</p><p>The smile that takes over his pretty mouth is the only response you need as he leans down to meet your lips hungrily in a passionate kiss. Neither of you have the intention of breaking away from the other, but unfortunately as the announcement of his flight preparing to board sounds; you know there isn\u2019t much of a choice in the matter. Once his lips part from yours, he brushes away a stray piece of hair that has fallen in your face and smirks. \u201cGonna miss you even more. Good thing I have all these gifts lined up for you to keep your mind on me and not your other boyfriend though.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Boyfriends </i>actually, there\u2019s more than one,\u201d you correct with a smug grin, and he just laughs. \u201cAnd I told you to quit it with the gifts Harry. How am I supposed to even compete with any of this when I finish putting together your gifts, hmm? You\u2019re making me look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould always take me up on that offer to fly you out to LA so you can come see me,\u201d he suggests all while knowing what your answer will be. </p><p>\u201cAnd you know I would; but work won\u2019t let me have the time off,\u201d you reason, and he nods his head knowingly. He goes to say something but is cut off by the final call for boarding his flight. </p><p>Sadness washes over his features yet again as he pulls you in for a hug and squeezes tightly. \u201cM\u2019sorry I won\u2019t be back but please know you\u2019re all I\u2019ll be thinking about until I can get back in January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know,\u201d you mumble into his chest as you wrap your arms around his middle and move back to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m counting down the days. Also, you need to go now or else you actually will miss your flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, petal,\u201d he states and leans down for one more kiss before finally moving away from your grasp. With one last wink, he slings his carryon bag over his shoulder and makes way to his gate; giving you a small wave before disappearing behind the doors. </p><p>\u2026Your life resumes normally the day after Harry leaves, and staying true to his word; each day after that you one way or another come across a gift and letter from the man of your dreams. </p><p>Some days he gets creative with them, and you\u2019re just left absolutely speechless. One day about a week after he\u2019s gone, you show up to work to find a small rectangular box waiting for you with a note that reads; <i>\u201cOn the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, something to wear from Tiffany.\u201d </i>The look of shock that registers on your face as you open up a simple, yet stunning small heart Tiffany and Co. necklace doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by your coworkers, and they soon become excited to see just what else your famous boyfriend has up his sleeve. </p><p>A couple of days later you\u2019re out getting lunch with Grimmy, who is unable to contain his excitement as he hands you a box with, yet another note attached to it. \u201cC\u2019mon love open it,\u201d he pushes, and he grins widely as you unfold the piece of paper. \u201cRead it out loud.\u201d</p><p>With an eyeroll at his dramatics you bite down on you lip and oblige to his demands. <i>\u201cOn the fifteenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, something to use for when I\u2019m lonely\u2026\u201d </i>You trail off at the end of the note\u2014unsure of what in the hell Harry could\u2019ve meant by writing that. Grimmy looks at you questionably as you unwrap the fancy paper to reveal the box of a vibrator; and waste no time in gasping loudly before hiding the sex toy under the table while Nick dies of laughter. </p><p>Five days later you answer the front door of yours and Harry\u2019s shared home to be met by a mailman with a package addressed to you. After thanking the man, you take the package into the kitchen and allow your mind to imagine what it could possibly contain once you see the package was sent from Harry\u2019s home in LA. Excitement and worry soon takes over you as you open the box to see a flimsy looking wrapped gift, and surprise! Another letter. </p><p><i>\u201cOn the twentieth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a shirt to keep from Stevie,\u201d </i>you read to yourself and can\u2019t help but feel a little puzzled. With a shake of your head, you tear into the wrapping paper and squeal in shock as you let the item fall onto the counter. You quickly dig your cell phone out from your pocket to call Harry and fangirl over the signed Fleetwood Mac shirt he just sent you from the concert he attended a few days ago and try to keep your cool in doing so; but end up failing miserably. </p><p>Harry\u2019s gifts have been so exceptional that you\u2019re literally at a loss of words by how above and beyond he has gone for you\u2014however, there isn\u2019t one day that passes where you open a new gift and think about how you would trade it, along with everything else you\u2019ve received just to have him home with you instead of being alone. You\u2019re not quite used to spending the holidays by yourself, but unfortunately with work it couldn\u2019t be arranged for you to go home and visit your family until after the holidays. So, when Anne and Gemma are kind enough to extend an invitation for you to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with all of Harry\u2019s family, you are more than happy to accept. </p><p>Soon enough Christmas Eve has approached, and you somehow managed to get the day off work\u2014which has led to you spending the entire day with Harry\u2019s relatives at Anne\u2019s home. The day has consisted of lots of food, laughs, and just an all-around good vibe as you get to spend time with some of the people who have been nothing but welcoming to you since the start of your relationship with a certain rock star. </p><p>As the day comes to an end and all the guests leave, you help with tiding everything up before settling onto a couch in the den to watch a Christmas movie with Anne and Gemma before calling it a night. Once the movie is over\u2014you discover that neither you or any of the two women you\u2019re with are tired despite the eventful day you all shared; deciding that stepping out to get some fresh air may help do the trick. </p><p>The three of you bundle up in coats and boots before heading outside into the crisp December air, and you can\u2019t help but smile at the sight of the snow that continues to fall thickly from the sky; really setting the Christmas mood. Anne proposes that you go to a nearby park where all the festive lights will still be on display, and you agree happily; this way the walk will be a bit more scenic and less crowded with it being well into the late hours of the night. </p><p>\u201cSo, Gem, is Michal coming here tomorrow?\u201d You ask Harry\u2019s sister and your friend as you all make way around a corner and the park Anne mentioned comes into view. </p><p>\u201cYeah he is, he should be here in the morning,\u201d she responds with a smile and glances at you sideways. \u201cAny word on when my brother is coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you mutter quietly and look down to your boots as they kick through the freshly fallen snow. \u201cChristmas sure isn\u2019t the same without him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was telling us about all the gifts he\u2019s been sending you from LA,\u201d Anne pipes in and smirks as you move your gaze to her. </p><p>\u201cDid he tell you how much shit I\u2019ve given him every day for doing that?\u201d You ask, suddenly feeling a little defensive over how the framed picture of the two of you, watch, and cologne you ended up buying Harry for Christmas seems like literally nothing compared to what he\u2019s done for you. </p><p>\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t need to. We already knew,\u201d Gemma chuckles and gently nudges you with her elbow. \u201cToo bad you\u2019re dating one of the most extra and stubborn people to ever walk this planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d you mumble; causing both women to laugh. In the distance you hear a clock ding, indicating a new hour has started but also that it is now officially Christmas Day as well. A smile graces your lips as you look at two of the most important women in Harry\u2019s life before wrapping your arms around their shoulders and pulling them in for group hug. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d</p><p>The two of them laugh again before each wrapping an arm around you, and around the other before repeating your words in unison. \u201cMerry Christmas Y/N!\u201d </p><p>After a moment of huddling together, you all break away and that\u2019s when you are finally able to take in the stunning lights that surround you. The different shapes and forms the lights take have you mesmerized for a few minutes before your gaze falls onto a tall lit up Christmas tree further into the park; and are quick in deciding that aspect of it all is your favourite. You smile to yourself before looking back to Anne and Gemma, who are grinning widely at you before giving each other a knowing glance. \u201cW-what? Is the something on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma giggles and glances at her mum again, who just nods. \u201cBut speaking of Christmas Day\u2026 Harry left us in charge of your final gift, so uhm here it is.\u201d She reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out an all too familiar piece of paper that once again has your name scribbled across it in Harry\u2019s distinctive writing.</p><p>You let out a breath and bite down on your lip before reaching for the letter\u2014and reading aloud what it says for one last time. <i>\u201cOn the twenty-fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, turn around and you will see?\u201d</i>The words leave your mouth as a question because this is by far the most confusing note Harry has left you, and you really don\u2019t know what to think of it. </p><p>With an unsure glance at the two women, they both motion for you to turn around and you slowly do as you\u2019re told. Nerves soon take over you, so you quickly shut your eyes before completing a one hundred and eighty degrees turn before slowly opening them again; never being able to prepare yourself for what stands there waiting as you do so. </p><p>A loud gasp escapes your mouth and tears well in your eyes as you\u2019re met by Harry standing there grinning back at you; all bundled up in his winter coat as the snowflakes begin collecting in the curls that stick out from underneath the grey hat he wears. You\u2019re not long in breaking out in a sprint to launch yourself into his waiting arms and engulfing him in the biggest hug you could possibly deliver. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d You ask excitedly as he chuckles at your reaction and returns the tight hug. </p><p>\u201cMade a couple arrangements so you wouldn\u2019t miss me too much,\u201d he explains with a wink. Normally you\u2019d be annoyed with a narcissistic comment like this, but right now you couldn\u2019t care less about it. \u201cDid you like your gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved them,\u201d you state and pull away to glance up at him. \u201cBut this one is by far my favourite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell m\u2019glad I didn\u2019t mess it up,\u201d he replies before bending down to meet your lips and a heated kiss. After a moment he breaks the kiss and smiles down at you affectionately. \u201cMerry Christmas Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas Harry,\u201d you respond and pull him in for another quick peck. </p><p>\u201cAlright you two,\u201d Anne\u2019s voice speaks up, causing the two of you to look over at her and Gem. \u201cIt\u2019s late and we have an early morning ahead of us, so why don\u2019t we head on home, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes mother,\u201d Harry answers her, and she gives him a threatening glance before turning around to lead the way back to the house. You and Harry fall into step together and silence takes over for a moment before he leans down to whisper something into your ear. \u201cHope you brought that vibrator.\u201d</p><p>Another gasp leaves your mouth as he smiles cheekily and sprints towards his mum and sister to avoid your wrath. You roll your eyes at his antics but leave him be as he pulls Anne and Gemma in for a hug; knowing that this is by far one of the best Christmases ever.</p><p><i>Don\u2019t forget to check out all the lovely pieces from everyone else taking part in this: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCqtXGUZzr49ZJD7dCtXCvA\">@tiostyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2L9DimjiwG3MNPQ9fqEzwg\">@harrysonlyangelsss</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkhDPXpIBLhtRTLd9SkfWpw\">@lovemepleaase</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcewlYTGCX5rsEAMHbwtUEg\">@harryswoods</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN2DHjKf5RfKNxLmJ_s8RNQ\">@meet-me-in-the-kitchen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNz7xHI6QYL-FzYSkzJdcjg\">@yeehaw-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc9z2eqUqRfZQSKVCVt7fg\">@pendantstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUv6KB4SkSW0--s3norFBfw\">@faith8993</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mewAbrobBDoNOkOPRdR7rsA\">@himagines</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo0n2Voxoxlypas8KGkrHdQ\">@meetyourmouths</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxbeDiVYKF8-7lyKjGWXUQQ\">@oh-clementine</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnZsGTeRFo4_epK1_hJUlNg\">@hestylesno</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXr1EH6J4biUmmUhGn7AavQ\">@tpwkwrites</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTqOs2OcomcWG97D7gfQXIg\">@itsholyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> hiiiii again friends I\u2019m back</i></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>25 Days of Christmas</h1><p>A/N: Sorry, you all get to deal with me for one last day of <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a>&lsquo;s <b><a href=\"https://alwaysjacked-up.tumblr.com/post/180117685903/25-days-of-christmas-happy-holidays-everyone-i-am\">25 Days of Christmas</a></b> here we goooooo. (this is a mess I apologize)</p><p><b><i>Harry breaks the news he won&rsquo;t be home to celebrate Christmas with Y/N. But he sends one gift per day for 25 days to show his love, and the 25th day he sends the most important gift yet</i></b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Word Count: 2.9k (look Nora I did it)</p><p>The obnoxious sound of your feet scraping against the ground as you drag your way through Heathrow&rsquo;s terminal seems pretty amplified despite the airport being fairly busy this early December morning. You and Harry are quiet as you walk side by side towards his gate, and you can&rsquo;t help but think of how this silence is a very rare occurrence between you and your boyfriend of <i>almost&nbsp;</i>two years; however, it seems fitting with the fact that he&rsquo;s leaving for LA&hellip; Again. </p><p>You could&rsquo;ve sworn that he just got back to London&mdash;and as you think back to him coming home shortly after Halloween your thoughts prove to be right seeing as here the two of you are preparing for his departure once again after just over a month of being in the same country together. It&rsquo;s not his fault and you know that, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean each time the two of you find yourselves in this same predicament it gets any easier; it&rsquo;s quite the opposite actually. </p><p>About two weeks into Harry being home again is when he decided to announce that he had to return to California during the first week of December, along with the awesome news that he would be unable to make it back for Christmas due to the busy schedule and workload he had waiting for him. You didn&rsquo;t take the news lightly and it resulted in a bit of an argument between the both of you. The fight really didn&rsquo;t last long&mdash;however, it did take a toll on Harry for he felt extremely bad with the thought of leaving you alone for the holidays; all despite you stressing that he really did not need too. But with Harry being Harry, he came up with a unique way of trying to make up for it. </p><p>It all started on the first of December. You were in the midst of groggily waking up after a night of drinking with Harry and some friends after a <i>Bring Me the Horizon&nbsp;</i>concert,&nbsp;and just as you were reaching over to brush your hand through your boyfriend&rsquo;s shaggy curls you found the space next to you vacant and a folded note with your name written across it in his place. The subtle pounding in your head from the beginning of your hangover increased as confusion started making itself known, but nonetheless you unfolded the piece of paper and read it aloud. </p><p><i>&ldquo;On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me, some Advil and a cup of tea.&rdquo; </i></p><p>As if on cue; Harry emerged into the bedroom with a tray full of fresh fruit, pancakes, toast, tea, and Advil to serve you breakfast in bed as a sweet gesture to start off his idea of making up for missing Christmas. This kind of thing continued over the next couple of days where each day he surprised you with something new and you would scold him for it; telling him to knock it off because there was no reason for him to feel bad and do such things for you&mdash;yet it didn&rsquo;t stop there. </p><p>This morning you woke up to him peppering you with kisses, which led to some extremely early morning sex before you were to drive him to the airport; only to be surprised with another note and a full tank of gas when you climbed into the car as his gift for the day. He didn&rsquo;t say anything as you narrowed your gaze at him while he climbed into the car and just shrugged it off&mdash;making a comment of you being the reason for if he were to miss his flight. With a loud scoff from you and a playful smack to his arm, he just chuckled in response; proudly showing off his dimples and winking at you. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have seduced me love, now m&rsquo;definitely gonna be late.&rdquo; </p><p>And much to your dismay, you ended up not being late in getting him to the airport and have led yourself to present time&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;my gate petal,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s deep voice breaks you from your thoughts, and you slowly glance up to see him trying to avoid eye contact. </p><p>A small smile tugs at your lips as you place your hand under his chin and move it, so his enticing green eyes will meet yours instead of the floor. &ldquo;I love you, and I&rsquo;m going to miss you H&hellip; really freaking bad.&rdquo;</p><p>The smile that takes over his pretty mouth is the only response you need as he leans down to meet your lips hungrily in a passionate kiss. Neither of you have the intention of breaking away from the other, but unfortunately as the announcement of his flight preparing to board sounds; you know there isn&rsquo;t much of a choice in the matter.

He goes to say something but is cut off by the final call for boarding his flight. </p><p>Sadness washes over his features yet again as he pulls you in for a hug and squeezes tightly. &ldquo;M&rsquo;sorry I won&rsquo;t be back but please know you&rsquo;re all I&rsquo;ll be thinking about until I can get back in January.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I already know,&rdquo; you mumble into his chest as you wrap your arms around his middle and move back to look at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting down the days. Also, you need to go now or else you actually will miss your flight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you, petal,&rdquo; he states and leans down for one more kiss before finally moving away from your grasp. With one last wink, he slings his carryon bag over his shoulder and makes way to his gate; giving you a small wave before disappearing behind the doors. </p><p>&hellip;Your life resumes normally the day after Harry leaves, and staying true to his word; each day after that you one way or another come across a gift and letter from the man of your dreams. </p><p>Some days he gets creative with them, and you&rsquo;re just left absolutely speechless.

The different shapes and forms the lights take have you mesmerized for a few minutes before your gaze falls onto a tall lit up Christmas tree further into the park; and are quick in deciding that aspect of it all is your favourite. You smile to yourself before looking back to Anne and Gemma, who are grinning widely at you before giving each other a knowing glance. &ldquo;W-what? Is the something on my face?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Gemma giggles and glances at her mum again, who just nods. &ldquo;But speaking of Christmas Day&hellip; Harry left us in charge of your final gift, so uhm here it is.&rdquo; She reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out an all too familiar piece of paper that once again has your name scribbled across it in Harry&rsquo;s distinctive writing.</p><p>You let out a breath and bite down on your lip before reaching for the letter&mdash;and reading aloud what it says for one last time. <i>&ldquo;On the twenty-fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me, turn around and you will see?&rdquo;</i>The words leave your mouth as a question because this is by far the most confusing note Harry has left you, and you really don&rsquo;t know what to think of it. </p><p>With an unsure glance at the two women, they both motion for you to turn around and you slowly do as you&rsquo;re told. Nerves soon take over you, so you quickly shut your eyes before completing a one hundred and eighty degrees turn before slowly opening them again; never being able to prepare yourself for what stands there waiting as you do so. </p><p>A loud gasp escapes your mouth and tears well in your eyes as you&rsquo;re met by Harry standing there grinning back at you; all bundled up in his winter coat as the snowflakes begin collecting in the curls that stick out from underneath the grey hat he wears. You&rsquo;re not long in breaking out in a sprint to launch yourself into his waiting arms and engulfing him in the biggest hug you could possibly deliver. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; You ask excitedly as he chuckles at your reaction and returns the tight hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Made a couple arrangements so you wouldn&rsquo;t miss me too much,&rdquo; he explains with a wink. Normally you&rsquo;d be annoyed with a narcissistic comment like this, but right now you couldn&rsquo;t care less about it. &ldquo;Did you like your gifts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Loved them,&rdquo; you state and pull away to glance up at him. &ldquo;But this one is by far my favourite.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well m&rsquo;glad I didn&rsquo;t mess it up,&rdquo; he replies before bending down to meet your lips and a heated kiss. After a moment he breaks the kiss and smiles down at you affectionately. &ldquo;Merry Christmas Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas Harry,&rdquo; you respond and pull him in for another quick peck. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright you two,&rdquo; Anne&rsquo;s voice speaks up, causing the two of you to look over at her and Gem. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late and we have an early morning ahead of us, so why don&rsquo;t we head on home, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes mother,&rdquo; Harry answers her, and she gives him a threatening glance before turning around to lead the way back to the house. You and Harry fall into step together and silence takes over for a moment before he leans down to whisper something into your ear. &ldquo;Hope you brought that vibrator.&rdquo;</p><p>Another gasp leaves your mouth as he smiles cheekily and sprints towards his mum and sister to avoid your wrath. You roll your eyes at his antics but leave him be as he pulls Anne and Gemma in for a hug; knowing that this is by far one of the best Christmases ever.</p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t forget to check out all the lovely pieces from everyone else taking part in this: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCqtXGUZzr49ZJD7dCtXCvA\">@tiostyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2L9DimjiwG3MNPQ9fqEzwg\">@harrysonlyangelsss</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkhDPXpIBLhtRTLd9SkfWpw\">@lovemepleaase</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcewlYTGCX5rsEAMHbwtUEg\">@harryswoods</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN2DHjKf5RfKNxLmJ_s8RNQ\">@meet-me-in-the-kitchen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNz7xHI6QYL-FzYSkzJdcjg\">@yeehaw-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc9z2eqUqRfZQSKVCVt7fg\">@pendantstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUv6KB4SkSW0--s3norFBfw\">@faith8993</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mewAbrobBDoNOkOPRdR7rsA\">@himagines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo0n2Voxoxlypas8KGkrHdQ\">@meetyourmouths</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxbeDiVYKF8-7lyKjGWXUQQ\">@oh-clementine</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnZsGTeRFo4_epK1_hJUlNg\">@hestylesno</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXr1EH6J4biUmmUhGn7AavQ\">@tpwkwrites</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTqOs2OcomcWG97D7gfQXIg\">@itsholyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> hiiiii again friends I&rsquo;m back</i></p></p>",
