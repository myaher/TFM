They made love together.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t see her after conversation with Bran and Sam.  He escaped from his lovers every time.  He knows how it hurts Dany but Jon was confuse. </p><p>Jon left this room and walked outside. He looked at Dany. He ws standing middle of the Winterfell and spoke with Arya. Jon was surprise. Ghost was there too. Jon missed his wolf but he followed to Dany everywhere.</p><p>- what are you doing here?_ Jon heard the voice. It was Bran.</p><p>- nothing.</p><p>-you&rsquo;re looking them?</p><p>- no just,&hellip; </p><p>- Arya likes queen. She is very close with her. More close than with her own sister. </p><p>Jon turned around. Arya was talking and Dany smiled. Bran was right. He never seen his sister like that. Especially with Sansa. </p><p>- she is beautiful.- tells Bran - she was beautiful and innocent when merried with Khal Drogo. She was amazing when her dragons born. </p><p>- did you see?</p><p>- I saw that night when she was born in Dragonstone. It was terrible night.  _Bran stopped and looked at him- you are her fate. Aegon Targaryen was her fate.</p><p>- don&rsquo;t speak about that.</p><p>- it&rsquo;s right. Targaryens married brother and sister during centuries. Age was always important.  Dany was equal of  your brother Aegon -Jon deep breaths. It was strange feelings. His brother was always Rickon, Robb and Bran. But his blood was only Aegon and Rhaenys-Daenerys is your fate. You can run from her but your roads are connecting with Queen. </p><p>-it&rsquo;s&hellip; I can&rsquo;t. I am a Stark. Ned Stark grow me up and &hellip;</p><p>- and Ned Stark&rsquo;s parents were cousins. </p><p>Jon looked at Dany. She was talking with Arya again. Queen made eye contact with him. Arya stopped and found her eyes. It was Jon. Arya smiled and tried to tell something but she found unbelievable sadness inside queen&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>-can we go? -asked Dany.</p><p>-where your grace?</p><p>-you can choice a place. Can you ridding horse?</p><p>-of course.</p><p>-good. Just take your horse.  </p><p>Dany took her horse so quickly and left Winterfell. Arya followed her.</p><p>-where are you going Daenerys?- Dany didn&rsquo;t like whenArya called &ldquo;your grace&rdquo;</p><p>-we can find Nymeria.</p><p>-she doesn&rsquo;t want to follow me. Nymeria is wilding now.</p><p>-animals can&rsquo;t leave their masters to easily. Drogon left me one time but she came back to me and saved me from killers. Probably Nymeria is angry to you but she knows who you are. </p><p>-Dragons can&rsquo;t leave their riders. Dragons are like humans. Sometimes they angry with us and just fly away. </p><p>-you think that Nymeria wants me again?</p><p>-I am sure. Just trust me.</p><p>Arya smiled and followed to her. </p><p>-My Brother&hellip;</p><p>-please Arya don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p><p>- he loves you. _Dany stopped her horse. She felt tears on the check _ he is confuse. He lost himself. He needs a time but I know&hellip; no, I don&rsquo;t know. I am absolutely sure that he loves you more than everyone and everything. I know him much better than others. I know what he feels now. </p><p>- and what he feels now Arya?</p><p>- Love and confuse. He is fighting with  himself. I found his feelings When you arrived in Winterfell with Jon. It&rsquo;s difficult to admit but Sansa was right about Jon.</p><p>- what about?</p><p>- about you both!</p><p>- she thought that we were together?</p><p>- she was Sure. I accepted it when I saw how he cared to you. How he looked at you. He was worrying about you. Jon told me that you had never experience with cold climate.  </p><p>- I am worrying about him too. He is alone now. He is confuse and lost and I cannot help.  _ he could not stop tears- he is my last relative, my last family, my last hope. I can&rsquo;t lose him Arya.
