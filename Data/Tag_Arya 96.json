Like Jon is Aegons third child, Dany is Aerys third child, Arya is Ned\u2019s third child, and Tyrion is Tywins third child. There seems to be so much importance on the characters who were the third kid. Maybe not Arya as much since she\u2019s the only one whose mother didn\u2019t die in childbirth with her but she\u2019s still so important to the story line that it makes me wonder.",
        "answer": "<p>Oh, definitely. The third child is one that does not inherit the title, nor is ever the heir at any point (until the firstborn has a child of their own). Like Benjen Stark or Loras Tyrell, the third child has to seek their own glory by their own merits, otherwise they fall into the shadows of their elder siblings. In short, the third child isn\u2019t remarkable or particularly remembered unless they take the initiative to make something of themselves. </p><p>Which is exactly what Jon, Dany, Arya and Tyrion are all about. Jon is a special case, given he never knew his siblings, but it very much applies to him re: Robb and even hypothetically with Aegon who would have been the Crown Prince - not Jon himself. </p><p>It reinforces the idea of them being outcasts or destined to never surpass their siblings - but in fact, they\u2019ve all defied expectations. </p><p>Regarding Arya\u2019s mother not dying in childbirth - true, that\u2019s a marked difference from the rest. But every parallel doesn\u2019t need to be exactly alike. In the same way that Tyrion doesn\u2019t have a beast of his own, or Bran isn\u2019t a third child, or Dany doesn\u2019t warg the way Jon, Arya or Bran do, it\u2019s about what such a parallel offers to the characters themselves. </p><p>Arya\u2019s mother did not die in childbirth, but she still grew up feeling insecure about her mother\u2019s affections. She still ends up motherless, a lost child, desperately wishing for her family. Not unlike the rest, really. </p><p>Regardless of the specifics of their situation, I think it ultimately comes down to the fact , Jon, Arya, Dany, Tyrion - and Bran - started from a position in the shadows and are emerging quickly to the top.

        "answer": "<p>I think it ends with the Throne destroyed and with that, what it represented, I think that the line \u201cI\u2019m going to break the wheel\u201d has a meaning and it\u2019s destroying what the Iron Throne represents.</p><p>The official poster that it\u2019s the Iron Throne and Drogon makes me believe that maybe I\u2019m in the right way (or I hope so lol). In the books many times it\u2019s said that Drogon is Balerion reborn and Daenerys is represented as a female version of Aegon I Targaryen, Aegon created the Seven Kingdom as we know them today and Balerion\u2019s fire was the one who helped create the Iron Throne. I think it would be poetic if Daenerys and Drogon ended what Aegon and Balerion started.</p><p>So, who ends in the Iron Throne? No one, there\u2019s no Iron Throne anymore, instead it will rise an assembly with the representants of the noble houses, it\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. I think the Westeros is going to be too much destroyed to be ruled by just one person, it needs the help of every powerful family. Maybe there\u2019s one or two more representative persons, but that\u2019s how I imagine the ending.</p><p>And I wish for the survival of my faves, like everyone right? That is Daenerys, Arya, Sansa, Missandei\u2026(yes, girl power!)<br/></p><p>I think characters that are going to die are Cersei, Euron, Jaime, Tormund, Pod, Varys, Melisandre, the Mountain, Jorah, Theon, Beric and Tyrion. Some of this death are based of spoilers and leaks I read and others in what I believe.</p><p>I know many people believe that the show is going to kill mostly everyone because of the line \u201cIf you think this story has a happy ending you haven\u2019t been paying attention\u201d, but I think it\u2019s an error to think like that, they are not going for a Disney ending but neither a traumatical ending were everyones dies, there are going to be a lot of deaths but mostly soldiers and minor characters deaths. We\u2019ll see a lot of destruction but the ones who will suffer more are the common people and not the main characters.</p><p>I know a lot of people believe that Daenerys is going to die (or some people want her to die). I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll die (and I don\u2019t want it either), but she won\u2019t be queen. I don\u2019t see her destiny is to die in the battle against the NK, or in childbirth like some people say. She\u2019ll take part of that assembly because her role is to help people and she needs to be in a position of power to do that.<br/>Daenerys is the Stallion who mounts the world (she united the dothrakis under the same khalasar, she\u2019s leading them to the end of the earth -crossed the sea, fight against the NK and his army-), she\u2019s the princess who was promised, Azor Ahai reborn, born amidst smoke and salt (she was born in Dragonstone during the worst storm in decades and she was reborn in the fire), the red comet was seen after she was reborn in the fire and she woke the dragons from the stones and the dragons are the burning sword, Lightbringer. Her destiny is to lead the people against the darkness and after that, help to rebuild the world, that\u2019s my theory of why she won\u2019t die.</p><p>About the other characters I think/want will survive I don\u2019t have such compelling reasons, but Arya is a survivor, Sansa for example, they completely changed her storyline, they took the storyline from other character for her in the show, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll die, they took a lot of trouble with her and I don\u2019t see Missandei dying, she\u2019s too important in terms for the future, the only one who knows so many languages and would be able to establish good relationships with other parts in the world when Westeros will need help to rebuilt itselfs.</p>",

That is Daenerys, Arya, Sansa, Missandei&hellip;(yes, girl power!)<br /></p><p>I think characters that are going to die are Cersei, Euron, Jaime, Tormund, Pod, Varys, Melisandre, the Mountain, Jorah, Theon, Beric and Tyrion. Some of this death are based of spoilers and leaks I read and others in what I believe.</p><p>I know many people believe that the show is going to kill mostly everyone because of the line &ldquo;If you think this story has a happy ending you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention&rdquo;, but I think it&rsquo;s an error to think like that, they are not going for a Disney ending but neither a traumatical ending were everyones dies, there are going to be a lot of deaths but mostly soldiers and minor characters deaths. We&rsquo;ll see a lot of destruction but the ones who will suffer more are the common people and not the main characters.</p><p>I know a lot of people believe that Daenerys is going to die (or some people want her to die). I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll die (and I don&rsquo;t want it either), but she won&rsquo;t be queen. I don&rsquo;t see her destiny is to die in the battle against the NK, or in childbirth like some people say. She&rsquo;ll take part of that assembly because her role is to help people and she needs to be in a position of power to do that.<br />Daenerys is the Stallion who mounts the world (she united the dothrakis under the same khalasar, she&rsquo;s leading them to the end of the earth -crossed the sea, fight against the NK and his army-), she&rsquo;s the princess who was promised, Azor Ahai reborn, born amidst smoke and salt (she was born in Dragonstone during the worst storm in decades and she was reborn in the fire), the red comet was seen after she was reborn in the fire and she woke the dragons from the stones and the dragons are the burning sword, Lightbringer. Her destiny is to lead the people against the darkness and after that, help to rebuild the world, that&rsquo;s my theory of why she won&rsquo;t die.</p><p>About the other characters I think/want will survive I don&rsquo;t have such compelling reasons, but Arya is a survivor, Sansa for example, they completely changed her storyline, they took the storyline from other character for her in the show, that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll die, they took a lot of trouble with her and I don&rsquo;t see Missandei dying, she&rsquo;s too important in terms for the future, the only one who knows so many languages and would be able to establish good relationships with other parts in the world when Westeros will need help to rebuilt itselfs.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Eh, I think to an extent we exaggerate it because Arya and Gendry have never <i>explicitly</i>\u00a0referred to each other as being best friends BUT we haven\u2019t pulled it from nowhere. It\u2019s just joining up very obvious dots.</p><p>Arya is very mistrustful of everyone around her due to the horrors she has had to go through - always cynical of people even when they treat her well. Within the show context, a decent example of this is actually the Brotherhood. They never mistreat her or harm her, and when they discover she\u2019s Arya Stark they decide to protect her; they don\u2019t let her\u00a0\u2018go\u2019 at the Inn at the Crossroads, not because they\u2019re wanting to hurt her, but because they acknowledge it is dangerous for Ned Stark\u2019s daughter to be by herself. But Arya still doesn\u2019t trust them.</p><p>Another good example is Hot Pie. He doesn\u2019t do anything to imply he would ever betray Arya\u2019s confidence - he follows her lead, trusts her, and whilst he can do very little to protect her, we know that if he could, he would. Yet Arya doesn\u2019t trust him enough to tell her who she is; he only finds out when the Hound recognises her. Hot Pie is her friend, yet she still doesn\u2019t trust him enough to tell him who she is, despite certainly <i>knowing</i>\u00a0he wouldn\u2019t betray her.</p><p>And so that takes us to Gendry - Gendry who Arya immediately forms an alliance with, Gendry who knows who she is, Gendry who Arya trusted enough to tell him who she is even when she barely knows him at all.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLommy and Hot Pie can\u2019t know. No one can know.\u201d<br/>\u201cWell they won\u2019t. Not from me.\u201d</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Arya doesn\u2019t trust people, yet she immediately trusts him. She views him as importantly as she views her family. This is why she is so distraught when she realises he intends to leave her.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThese men are brothers. They\u2019re a family. I\u2019ve never had a family.\u201d<br/></i><i>\u201cI can be your family.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Book wise, their duo is even more pronounced - Arya trusts him to keep watch when she sleeps, knowing he won\u2019t harm her. She goes to him when she needs help with things. The two are a team, who work intuitively together. She compares him with Jon in her mind, often, who we all know is the most important person to her.</p><p>After she is separated from Gendry, Arya never truly trusts anyone else again. Her identity remains hidden. She never actively chooses to tell someone who she is again. Arya <i>never</i>\u00a0trusts anyone like she trusts Gendry.</p><p>So to summarise, before I start rambling away again - no, it\u2019s never explicitly stated they are\u00a0\u2018best friends\u2019, but logic tells you everything you need to know. Of course, there are romantic undertones going on which add other dimensions, but he is the only person beyond her family who she thinks of often, who she trusts entirely, who she jibes with like she does her brothers, who she has an unspoken trust and teamwork duo with. So yes. Gendry is quite obviously Arya\u2019s best friend. <strike>And it\u2019s why their reunion is going to be emotional and I\u2019m EXCITED because they trust each other like they trust nobody else</strike></p>",

And at least imply it\u2019s because Arya would prefer him as her \u201cforest love\u201d and being his \u201cforest lass\u201d rather than be lord and lady. Yeah, it\u2019s fairytale-ish and fan fic-y but dammit, I\u2019m prepared for pretty much everyone else having to \u201csettle\u201d and I want Arya to have the happiest ending she can manage. \u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s actually not completely baseless:</p><p>In agot, Ned tells Arya she will marry a king someday and Arya tells him, \u201cNo, that\u2019s <i>Sansa</i>.\u201d This, of course, was written when Arya and Jon were most likely meant to end up together so that was probably foreshadowing/irony.

Similarly, Arya would have loved to grow up traveling and meeting new people and learning combat techniques but she didn\u2019t get to actually enjoy any of it. She was always on the run from someone trying to kill her and most of the time didn\u2019t even know if she\u2019d be able to get food and water or shelter.\u00a0</p><p>Just as Sansa has been making her dreams come true on her own terms, Arya deserves the same. I want her to have the chance to experience adventure without having to be afraid or hide who she is. I want her to be able to sit down and befriend random people she comes across and listen to their stories and share her own. I want her to be able to stop by to see her friends and family members without discovering that they\u2019ve just been murdered or recently traumatized.</p><p><b>And Gendry is still the best choice to accompany Arya.
