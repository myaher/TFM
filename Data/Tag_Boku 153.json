Now an adult and professional mage, \nshe\u2019s ready to help her parents as a healer for their village. The last \nthing she expects is for her beliefs to become a reality, but when a \ndragon attacks her village, she learns there\u2019s more to magic than she \never could\u2019ve realized.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16804609/chapters/41365580\">Read on AO3</a><br/><br/>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z3xF4a7jao2Xy-1acpZzw\">@its-love-u-asshole</a> for reading this over. <br/></small></p><p><small>With a huff, Bakugou followed Uraraka and Todoroki to a large covered\n arena the townsfolk prepared for the dragon battle. Apparently this \ntown enjoyed tournaments and sports, and many people spent their time \ngambling here&hellip; it was possibly the worst place Kirishima could&rsquo;ve \nended up.</small></p><p><small>He wrinkled his nose when they stepped into the arena, \nthe loud cheers and murmurings of humans hurting his ears. Deplorable \nfucking creatures. How the hell did they think it was okay to hurt an \nendangered creature. Did humans find something rare and immediately want\n to be rid of it?</small></p><p><small>He glanced at Uraraka, gesturing to Todoroki \nabout something, he couldn&rsquo;t hear her over the large roaring of the \ncrowd. He supposed not all humans were bad, and perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t fair \nfor him to make an assumption. Or maybe&hellip; it was just that he didn&rsquo;t \nhate <i>her</i>.</small></p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go sign us up,&rdquo; Uraraka said, gesturing to a long line of men waiting by the entrance. &ldquo;Get us a seat?&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou\n nodded, following after Todoroki. The crowd was already rowdy, cheering\n over loud music. Many of them were drinking already, looking jovial and\n ready to celebrate whoever their champion would be.</p><p>The arena was\n dome shaped and covered with large bars, and Bakugou wondered if he and\n Kirishima could break them if they were both in dragon form. He \nsupposed they needed to have some way to keep Kirishima fucking \ncontained.</p><p>He growled, looking at the ceiling. Hopefully Kirishima\n hadn&rsquo;t lost his fucking mind. If he only had the mind of a dragon, it \nwould make it next to impossible to communicate with him, even if they \nwere both in dragon form.</p><p>&ldquo;How is here, Bakugou?&rdquo; Todoroki asked, \nand he stared at the spot. He didn&rsquo;t give a shit where they sat, so \ninstead of responding, he plopped his ass down, folding his arms. He \nadjusted the hood on his cloak, making sure it stayed up. The last thing\n he needed was to reveal his shit to the people around them.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi&hellip; Half and Half&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered, folding his arms. &ldquo;Do you think this is going to work?&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki\n blinked, as if he was surprised Bakugou was asking him such a serious \nquestion. He frowned, turning towards the center of the arena. &ldquo;If you \nlisten to Uraraka, I think it&rsquo;ll go well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled, keeping his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>He fucking hated the idea of having to listen to a goddamn human, but she was convinced this plan would work.</p><p>It\n also meant having to use his dragon form, something he was actively \ntrying to avoid doing. The last thing he needed was to get stuck too. If\n need be, he would force himself to shift back to human form, but it \nwould be unpleasant, and possible drain more magic from himself than \nneeded.</p><p>&ldquo;Bakugou?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah!?&rdquo; he growled, snapping from his \nthoughts as he turned to look up at Uraraka. Fuck she was pretty. Her \nhat covered part of her forehead, but her brown hair still brushed \nagainst her round cheeks, the sun a bright backdrop against her cute \nsmile.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; I asked if you could move over just a bit?&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Blinking, Bakugou shook his head, pulled from his damn thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; he growled, moving closer to Todoroki.</p><p>&ldquo;I\n signed us up,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;They made fun of me, saying they \ndidn&rsquo;t think a little girl like me could possibly take on the dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou frowned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fucking bullshit. I&rsquo;d like to see their pansy asses take on a dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; we&rsquo;re not first&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;So you will get the chance to watch. Hopefully no one else&hellip; is strong enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like hell they will be!&rdquo; Bakugou snorted and folded his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome\n everyone, to the first annual dragon slaying competition!&rdquo; A loud voice\n boomed from up on the top of the stands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the mayor of this fair \ntown, and today many of you have signed up to have the chance to take on\n the great red dragon we have captured. It took many of our ice, ground,\n and fire elemental guard to capture such a large creature and today&hellip; \nYou will have the chance to prove your strength against such a powerful \nbeing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; idiot,&rdquo; Bakugou growled.</p><p>Before the mayor \ncould continue speaking, there was a loud roar heard in the distance, \nthe entire stadium shaking. Bakugou clenched his fists by his side. It \nwas certainly Kirishima, he would&rsquo;ve recognized the deafening sound \nanywhere. Though he could tell the sound was painful&hellip; Kirishima&rsquo;s roar\n didn&rsquo;t have the normal spark Bakugou was used to.</p><p>&ldquo;There you have\n it! The creature approaches! We do hope you know that we have \nconstrained the dragon to the best of our ability, but we cannot be held\n responsible if it attacks or breaks free. Our guard does stand at the \nready,&rdquo; the man continued.</p><p>The ground shook, and Bakugou narrowed \nhis eyes, watching as the large gates to the arena opened. Men were \npulling on long chains, tugging the creature forward and when Kirishima \nfinally entered the arena, Bakugou stood up, his body trembling with \nanger.</p><p>His wings were chained back, unable to fly even if he \nwanted to. There was a large chain muzzle around his lips, his jaw \nunable to open much wider; no wonder his cry had been so muffled.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; A man behind Bakugou pushed his hand onto his shoulder and Bakugou whipped his head around, glaring.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell me what to fucking do, I&rsquo;ll bite your head off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;E-Eesh&hellip;&rdquo; The man blinked, slowly pulling his hand away.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bakugou maybe you should-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at what they&rsquo;re doing! Of course they&rsquo;re going to kill him!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna fucking kill them first!&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima\n let out another pained cry, tugging his head back on the chains. A few \nof the men on the ground fell backwards, but even with the movement, \nKirishima didn&rsquo;t have enough control over his wings. They were torturing\n him, and it was possible they were going to kill him.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bakugou&hellip; please!&rdquo;</p><p>Her\n fingers gently wrapped around his hand, giving him a gentle tug. As \nmuch as he wanted to charge out and rescue his friend, he knew it would \ndo him no good to be impatient. Slowly, he lowered himself back down, \ntrembling against the bench.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your time, Bakugou,&rdquo; Todoroki said calmly.</p><p>&ldquo;We fucking better!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I present to you&hellip; the RED DRAGON!&rdquo; The mayor called out and the entire audience erupted into a loud cheer.</p><p>Kirishima\n glanced around, smoke huffing from his nostrils as he clearly searched \nfor some way to escape. His wings fluttered, the chains rattling as he \ntried to spread them, finding himself immediately incapable of movement.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s\n not gonna have a fucking chance&hellip;&rdquo; Bakugou hissed, his fingers curling\n against his pants. How the fuck was he supposed to do anything if he \nwas completely chained up? He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use his fire, nor \nwould he be able to fly&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;First up, we have our strongest \nbarbarian! A man from the city! To prove how strong this dragon is&hellip; \nlet&rsquo;s see how well he fares!&rdquo; The mayor\u2019s voice was loud and nasally, \ndisgusting to listen to, and Bakugou wondered if all human leaders were \nthis deplorable.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he muttered, watching the man step into \nthe arena with a giant battle axe. His muscles were huge, pulsing as he \nheld the large weapon in his hand.</p><p>Kirishima&rsquo;s pathetic cry was \nheard throughout the arena and surely farther than that&hellip; even with his\n mouth chained, the sound was booming.</p><p>The man swung his axe and \nKirishima leaped back, his legs collapsing to the ground. The man&rsquo;s axe \nhit his leg and Kirishima stumbled backwards, bright red blood seeping \nfrom the thick gash in his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Bakugou cursed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go now&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&hellip; not yet!&rdquo; Uraraka hissed.</p><p>Fucking bullshit, they couldn&rsquo;t-</p><p>With\n another loud roar, the man raised his axe, and Kirishima stomped with \nhis other foot on the ground, causing the man to stumble backwards. It \nwasn&rsquo;t enough to throw him completely off balance as he charged forward \nagain.</p><p>Kirishima tried to jump back and swing his tail towards the\n man, but the barbarian clipped the edge with his axe. Kirishima&rsquo;s head \nswung back, his mouth opening slightly while he yelped in pain.</p><p>All around the audience cheered, hollering with joyous laughter for the awful barbarian man.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I\n can&rsquo;t watch this,&rdquo; Uraraka breathed, covering her eyes. He couldn&rsquo;t \nexactly blame her. Nothing about the fight was fucking fair. Then again,\n if Kirishima was unchained, this man would be dead in a moment.</p><p>The\n man let out a hearty laugh. He lifted his axe once more, charging \nforward as he leaped up. This time, however, Kirishima lowered his head,\n swinging it to the side. He knocked the man straight against the wall. \nHe more than likely would&rsquo;ve been fine, if he hadn&rsquo;t been holding the \naxe behind him, it pressed into his back, shooting straight through his \nstomach and chest. Blood spurted from his mouth and his limbs, and he \nimmediately slouched over as he dangled against the wall.</p><p>All around the audience booed and hissed, gasping at such a ghastly sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Good fucking riddance,&rdquo; Bakugou snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;O-Oh&hellip;\n the man has come to an unsightly end!&rdquo; the mayor called sadly. &ldquo;But&hellip; \nyou came here to witness fights, and fights you will get. The red beast \nhas been injured, but as you can see, he won&rsquo;t be giving up anytime \nsoon. Up next we have someone else from out of town, a young mage <i>girl</i>, if she&rsquo;s still here. After that gruesome battle, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\n still here!&rdquo; Uraraka&rsquo;s yell was heard through the stadium, immediately \nquieting the mayor. Everyone turned to stare at her, including Bakugou. \nHis cheeks flushed as he stared at the woman before him; she held her \nstaff against her chest, her brown eyes glaring with determination. &ldquo;And\n I won&rsquo;t need to <i>kill</i> the dragon to defeat him! Clear a path!&rdquo; \nshe demanded, watching people on the benches in front of her slowly move\n to the side as she walked forward.</p><p>Her aura was insanely \npowerful, the gravity of it hitting Bakugou in the chest. Silently he \nwondered if she even needed him, with the level of intensity in her \neyes, she could probably get Kirishima to listen on his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Bakugou,&rdquo; she said, turning around, her hair swinging across her face. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>He\n bit his lip, his teeth trembling. She didn&rsquo;t need to order him the fuck\n around, but he wasn&rsquo;t about to argue. Not right now. He stood up and \nfollowed her, walking down past the crowd, keeping his gaze down.</p><p>&ldquo;Not\n going to kill him?&rdquo; The mayor began to laugh loudly, the crowd quickly \njoining in, but Uraraka&rsquo;s resolve did not sway. Bakugou watched her gait\n fill with more confidence as they laughed at her.</p><p>She was more than human.</p><p>She was a strong, powerful mage, and nothing was going to stop her.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\n right!&rdquo; she yelled over the laughter. &ldquo;While all of you are hoping to \nhurt this creature,&rdquo; she said, tapping each foot with her staff. She \ngently floated down into the arena, her feet landing on the dirt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m \ngoing to show there&rsquo;s no need for that. I&hellip; am dragon tamer and I&rsquo;m \ngoing to prove it right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Following after Uraraka, Bakugou hopped down into the dirt, standing directly next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh? And how do you plan to prove that!?&rdquo; The mayor roared with laughter yet again.</p><p>&ldquo;With my dragon right here,&rdquo; she said, gesturing to Bakugou.</p><p>&ldquo;Yours?&rdquo; Bakugou hissed, narrowing his red eyes at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; deal with it!&rdquo; she grumbled under her breath.</p><p>The crowd began to murmur, confusion spreading across the large group of people.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry dear, but I think you are sorely mistaken! For that is not a dragon,&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a person!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n really?&rdquo; she smirked and Bakugou immediately lowered his hood. His \ngolden scales shone in the sunlight, his elongated pointed ears \nglistening against the rays of the morning beams. More murmurs spread \nthrough the crowd, especially from those close to the front who could \nactually see.</p><p>As soon as the hood came off, Kirishima let out a \nroar, raising his feet up to stomp them to the ground. The chains \nrattled against his wings, and Bakugou met his eyes. He nodded once, \nhoping his idiot friend wasn&rsquo;t actually worried about him; he could tell\n Kirishima wanted him to leave.</p><p>Uraraka turned to Bakugou. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; she whispered, stepping forward to place her hand on his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip; Guess I fucking have to be,&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>She\n let her fingers fan out over his heart, pretending as if she was the \none to control his transformation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered, her \nbrown eyes filled with concern.</p><p>&ldquo;Quit worrying, Cheeks. We got this.&rdquo; </p><p>His\n chest felt warm, a gentle hum trickling under his skin. He stared at \nher for a moment. Was she transferring magic to him? It was faint, but \nhe could feel her magical current pulsing towards his heart. He blushed,\n and wrapped his fingers around her wrist. &ldquo;Stand back&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>Stepping\n away from her, he released his tight hold on his magic, his body \ntrembling with the release. His chest lurched forward, wings immediately\n sprouting from his back. He cried out, the bones and muscles under his \nskin cracking as he fell to the ground, pressing his palms flat against \nthe earth. Claws curled out from his fingertips, scraping against the \nground. He roared again, his jaw elongating and pushing forward.</p><p>He\n was used to the transformation by now. After almost 19 years, he would \nhave to be. It hurt, but Bakugou was mostly numb to the pain. He was \nused to his spine stretching as his golden tail sprouted behind him. He \nwas used to his arms and legs, changing his body and growing rapidly.</p><p>He stood, the transformation complete, and he stared at Kirishima.</p><p><i>&lsquo;Idiot. What the hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing getting yourself captured?!&rsquo;</i>\n he hissed, sending the mental thoughts to Kirishima. Smoke huffed from \nthe tip of his nose and all around him, and he became acutely aware of \nthe audience\u2019s screams.</p><p><i>'Bakugou! What are YOU doing here?!&rsquo;</i> he said, his voice panicked.</p><p>A\n rush of relief washed over Bakugou, happy Kirishima could understand \nhis spoken thoughts. He hadn&rsquo;t lost himself completely to the beast.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Fucking hell. I came for you. We have to go back.&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>Kirishima fluttered his wings pathetically. <i>'I-I can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</i> he stammered. <i>'I can&rsquo;t change back!&rsquo;</i></p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'I had a feeling&hellip;&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;As you can see,&rdquo; Uraraka began, and Bakguou&rsquo;s gaze snapped down \nto her. Right. He was supposed to be fucking listening to her or \nwhatever&hellip; &ldquo;This is my dragon, and he obeys my commands.&rdquo;</p><p>Obeys?! She was really fucking milking this for all it was worth, wasn&rsquo;t she?</p><p>He huffed again, smoke puffing out of his nostrils.</p><p><i>'Who is this girl? What are you doing? Are you really under her control!?&rsquo;</i> Kirishima asked, rushing through a list of questions.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Of course not dumb ass! She&rsquo;s helping me rescue your stupid face! If you listen to her, we can probably get you out!&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'So you want me to play along?&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p><i>'Yeah just&hellip; fucking listen to her for now.&rsquo;</i> Bakugou nodded, leaning his head down to her.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'I&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;re being so submissive!&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Shut the fuck up!&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;How can you prove that he won&rsquo;t attack you?&rdquo; the mayor called out and Bakugou turned his head, huffing out a breath of smoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly,\n he&rsquo;s not attacking me or anyone right now!&rdquo; she laughed and gently \npressed her hand up against his snout. With a grunt, he nuzzled her.</p><p>&ldquo;Can\n you control when he attacks?&rdquo; There was something about the mayor&rsquo;s \nvoice; it trembled with a deep fear, and that made Bakugou smirk with \npride.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Bakugou&hellip; fire!&rdquo; she cried out.</p><p>The hell!? She\n wanted him to use that much magic!? He let out a growl and stood up, \nshooting flames into the arena. They fell against the dirt and flickered\n before Bakugou stepped on them with his large foot to put it out. The \nlast thing he needed was them thinking they were hostile.</p><p>&ldquo;You \nare&hellip; quite powerful&hellip; young lady,&rdquo; the mayor said, and Bakugou turned\n to face him. A dark look came over his eyes. Something wasn\u2019t right. \nBakugou could tell this man wasn\u2019t going to listen to Uraraka in the way\n she hoped. He immediately stepped in front of her, hoping to stop any \nattacks that came her way. &ldquo;ELEMENTAL GUARDS!&rdquo; the mayor yelled, \npointing directly at Bakugou.</p><p>Uraraka gasped, clutching her staff \nto her chest and she turned her head just in time to hear more members \nof the audience scream as Todoroki held his hand out, making an ice \nslide down to the arena.</p><p>&ldquo;T-Todoroki!&rdquo; she yelled, now standing next to him as he landed in the arena next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to get out of here. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; we can&rsquo;t leave Kirishima!&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou\n was quick to spread his wings, puffing out smoke as he spat a ring of \nfire around them, blockading them from the charging guards.</p><p>&ldquo;If \nthey have water elementals, this isn&rsquo;t going to last very long,&rdquo; \nTodoroki murmured, rushing towards Kirishima. &ldquo;We might be able to cut \nthrough the chains with my ice. Do you have any offensive spells?&rdquo; he \nasked.</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Only healing magic!&rdquo; she gasped, shaking her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try ice. If we can at least break the ones on his wings we can get him out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The arena is covered!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered, glancing around. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s at least get the chains off and then we can try and find an escape route.&rdquo;</p><p>As\n the two approached, Kirishima bucked backwards, tossing his legs into \nthe air and shaking his head, the chains rattling against his back.</p><p><i>'They&rsquo;re gonna fucking help you, moron!&rsquo;</i>\n Bakugou huffed. He turned his head towards the sky. He could possibly \nbreak the structure if he slammed his back against the large metal beams\n covering the surface.</p><p>Pressing his feet close to the ground, he \nlaunched himself into the air, the wind from his wings pushing the fire \nout and causing the guards to fall backwards. Idiots. Did they really \nthink they could beat his fire?</p><p>&ldquo;WAVE!&rdquo; One of the guards called out, a giant rush of water pushing towards the flames.</p><p>Fucking shitty humans and their shitty magic!</p><p>Bakugou\n pushed his back against the metal, crying out loudly when he hit \nagainst the bars. It hurt, but it certainly made a dent. If they could \nget the chains off of Kirishima&rsquo;s wings, the two of them could probably \ndo it together.</p><p>As they ran close to Kirishima, Uraraka held her \nstaff out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get us higher!&rdquo; she breathed. She never used her \ngravity magic on two people before, but desperate times called for \ndesperate measures.</p><p>&ldquo;FLOAT!&rdquo; she cried out, tapping both of \nTodoroki&rsquo;s feet. He began to rise, his hair floating upwards. &ldquo;F-FLOAT!&rdquo;\n she called out once more, tapping her own two feet. She reached for \nTodoroki&rsquo;s hand, pushing herself off of the ground, she flung them up \nwith momentum, the two of them landing on Kirishima&rsquo;s wing.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Uraraka?&rdquo; Todoroki asked, looking at her with concern.</p><p>&ldquo;F-Fine,&rdquo; she gasped, kneeling on Kirishima&rsquo;s wing.</p><p>He\n nodded, knowing they didn&rsquo;t stand a chance if they kept wasting time. \n&ldquo;Freeze!&rdquo; he cried out and ice wrapped around Kirishima&rsquo;s wing, the cold\n substance covering his red, scaly skin.</p><p>&ldquo;WAVE!&rdquo; More guards were \narriving, waves of water covering the flames Bakugou kept attempting to \nreplenish. Uraraka glanced up, watching Bakugou push against the metal \nbeams. He looked exhausted, and she was worried he was using too much of\n his magic. Either way, she supposed him overworking himself a little \nwas better than them all dying.</p><p>The red dragon cried out and began\n to flap his wing, the ice starting to crack against the metal, the \nchains about the snap. Todoroki leaped forward, landing directly on \nKirishima&rsquo;s back. He held his hand out, casting the spell to wrap the \nice around his other wing.</p><p>The dragon rolled his back, shaking out as his entire body shivered, bucking underneath the smaller humans.</p><p>&ldquo;FREEZE!&rdquo; Guards called out, shooting ice in the direction of Kirishima.</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki!&rdquo; Uraraka cried, gesturing towards the ice headed directly towards them.</p><p>He\n whipped his body around, holding his other hand out as he felt the \nchains heat up against his hand. &ldquo;FIRE!&rdquo; he yelled, shooting flames from\n the jewels against his palm, the flames melting the ice it immediately \ncame into contact with.</p><p>&ldquo;Uraraka!&rdquo; Todoroki cried out, holding his other hand out to her. &ldquo;We have to hold on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;R-Right,&rdquo;\n she cried out, jumping forward to take his hand. She clung to him hard \nas Kirishima&rsquo;s wings spread, breaking the frozen ice.</p><p>Todoroki lunged forward, grabbing at one of the chains around his neck as he clung to Uraraka hard. &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; she gasped as Kirishima pushed into the air.</p><p>The\n two dragons nodded to each other, slamming their backs against the \nmetal bars. Bakugou huffed, shooting flames down at the guards in front \nof him. The dragon&rsquo;s fire was far more overpowering than Todoroki&rsquo;s, and\n any ice that shot their way was far too small and not high enough to \nreach them.</p><p>With another slam, the bars bent upwards, leaving enough space for them to escape, dashing into the air.</p><p>Uraraka\n clung to Todoroki, the wind whipping against her cheeks as she slammed \nher eyes shut, hoping they would land somewhere far, far away from any \nother villages or towns.</p><p>~~</p><p>It took about an hour of flying \nto get anywhere away from civilization. They flew over towns and \nvillages and Ochako was certain rumors would be flying now.</p><p>As \nthey made their way towards the mountains, Bakugou nodded his head \ntowards a large cave on the side, flying down towards it, landing \nagainst the large ledge.</p><p>Kirishima followed closely behind and \nwhen he pressed his feet to the ground, he bowed his head down, allowing\n Ochako and Todoroki to slip down to the ground.</p><p>Her brown hair \nfluttered about her face and Todoroki&rsquo;s looked as it had been slicked \nback, the force of the wind was so strong high in the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t believe we made it&hellip;&rdquo; Ochako whispered, her hands trembling against her staff.</p><p>&ldquo;Same&hellip;&rdquo;\n Todoroki muttered and quickly turned around towards Kirishima. &ldquo;I could\n probably freeze the muzzle off in the same way if you don&rsquo;t mind your \nmouth being cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima&rsquo;s ears perked up and he leaned down, \ncrouching close the ground. Holding his palm out, Todoroki breathed the \nword out and ice curled around Kirishima&rsquo;s snout, freezing the chains. \n&ldquo;Give it a moment and you should be able to break them with your jaw.&rdquo;</p><p>Ochako turned towards Bakugou, wondering if he would be able to change back. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; she asked, stepping towards him.</p><p>He growled, turning his head away from her for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s okay&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>He\n let out another growl, his body lurching forward as he began to shrink \nback to his human form. Immediately, he fell to his knees, his chest \nheaving, coughs slipping between his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bakugou!&rdquo; she \ngasped, running to him. Scales littered his face once again, his long \nears twitching as he tried to catch his breath. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in pain,&rdquo; she \nsaid softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m fucking fine!&rdquo; he snapped, his body \nalmost completely back to normal minus the scales on his face, his ears \nand his dragon wings. &ldquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Please let me help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\n can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he hissed, feebly attempting to pull away from her. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t \nfucking give me magic, so what the hell do you plan on doing!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if I heal you, you can pull your wings back&hellip; at the very least.&rdquo;</p><p>His\n wings fluttered behind him, his face wincing. They looked heavy against\n his body, and his panting grew heavier. &ldquo;Fuck. Do&hellip; whatever you want.\n It&rsquo;s not going to work!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-It might,&rdquo; she whispered, pressing \nher hand to his chest. Her hand felt heated, the small hum of magic \nreturning under her palm. She pressed her staff over his heart, and shut\n her eyes. &ldquo;Cure,&rdquo; she whispered, her palm feeling hot.</p><p>&ldquo;Ngh&hellip;&rdquo; \nhe grunted, his head dropping back. He winced, his back arching as his \nwings slowly began to fold back towards his body. The large bruises on \nhis back slowly disappeared, and the searing pain in his chest, back, \nand neck dissipated as well.</p><p>This woman&hellip; had far more magical \nability than she let on. How could such a small body hold so much power?\n He didn&rsquo;t underestimate her, never had, and definitely never would. \nWatching her walk into the arena with such confidence earlier was hard \nto ignore&hellip; and even now, watching her be so certain about what her \npower could do. It was something she never tried, and yet she was so \nconfident she could help his transformation.</p><p>And she was right apparently.</p><p>Ochako\n swallowed, her brown eyes turning up towards him. &ldquo;T-There&hellip;&rdquo; she \nwhispered. Her hand pressed against his chest as she tried to push back.\n Her arm trembled and her breathing grew heavy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you could&hellip; \ns-shift just&hellip; a little more&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! What did you do?&rdquo; Bakugou growled.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I healed you&hellip;&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;You\n used too much magic, didn&rsquo;t you!?&rdquo; Snapping at her, he shook her \nshoulders in an attempt to keep her awake. But her eyes fluttered shut, \nand her head rolled forward. &ldquo;Uraraka!&rdquo; Bakugou yelled as she slumped \nagainst him, completely passed out.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! Half and Half!&rdquo; Bakugou yelled. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s wrong with Cheeks!&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki\n glanced away from Kirishima, closing his palm. The ice was settling \naround the muzzle and he nodded, letting the dragon wait. He pushed up, \nwalking over to Bakugou, his eyes widening when he saw her face pressed \nagainst Bakugou&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fucking know!&rdquo; Bakugou yelled. &ldquo;She started healing me to help me shift back and then she fuckin&rsquo; just&hellip; passed out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She overused her magic,&rdquo; Todoroki muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how the hell that&rsquo;s even possible, since you idiots don&rsquo;t use magic through your fucking bodies!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;\n not exactly. The source of magic doesn&rsquo;t come from our bodies, no, but \nthe magical current flows through us when we activate the items we use. \nSo technically it does use her energy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I did feel an odd hum \nagainst her hand when she used her goddamn magic. I told her she didn&rsquo;t \nhave to!&rdquo; he growled, holding her in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip; A weird hum?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, when she had her hand on my chest,&rdquo; Bakugou snapped, his gaze fixated on the girl in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm&hellip;&rdquo;\n Todoroki tapped his chin, looking at the two of them. It was odd&hellip; \nsomething like that shouldn&rsquo;t have come from her hand, but her staff \nrather. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a fire started,&rdquo; he said, backing away. &ldquo;Let her rest,\n her energy will replenish and she will wake up.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Bakugou muttered, his hand touching her brown hair.</p><p>He\n cared about her far more than he let on. Even after the fire started, \nit took Bakugou a moment to lay her down, covering her with his cloak.</p><p>&ldquo;Watch her,&rdquo; he demanded, pointing to Todoroki.</p><p>&ldquo;I will, you have nothing to worry about. She just needs sleep,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled, heading away from the fire and out onto the ledge. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Kirishima.&rdquo;</p><p>With\n the muzzle having been frozen off, Kirishima only had a chain around \nhis neck, his body able to move as freely as possible. He turned his \nhead towards the two humans, and glanced back at Bakugou who was \ntraipsing towards the edge of the cave. He plopped down on the edge, \ndangling his legs over the side.</p><p>Kirishima followed, laying down next to him, curling his tail to the side.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to leave,&rdquo; Bakugou said.</p><p><i>'So fast? You&rsquo;re going to miss that human girl!&rsquo;</i> Kirishima&rsquo;s tone was taunting, and his head moved up and down with his laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to fucking miss her. We have bigger problems. You can&rsquo;t change back can you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'No&hellip; I thought if I was away from that village I might be able to when things calmed down but&hellip; I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking&hellip; dammit!&rdquo; he hissed, slamming his fist against the \nstone ground. &ldquo;Humans&hellip; aren&rsquo;t stealing our magic. They can&rsquo;t even use \nit on their own.&rdquo;</p><p><i>'What!?&rsquo;</i> Kirishima lifted his head, glancing back at the two human mages inside the cave.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.\n They need a fucking&hellip; I dunno&hellip; magical object or some bullshit!&rdquo; He \ngestured back towards them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Half and Half has those weird \nhand things and Cheeks has the staff,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'How&hellip; did you meet them exactly?&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>Bakugou rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Look my magic isn&rsquo;t doing great \neither and I got captured in a village&hellip; but Cheeks has some kind of \ndragon fetish so she rescued me. It got her banished from her town and \nwe went to the city to find Half and Half, another dragon fanatic. He \nheard rumors of you and I came to fucking get you. The end. Now we have \nto go home, we don&rsquo;t have time to dick around here worrying about \nhumans.&rdquo;</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Wait&hellip; you got her banished from her town and you&rsquo;re just&hellip; gonna ditch her!? She saved you, dude!&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell else am I supposed to do?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done \nhanging out with humans and we&rsquo;re not any closer to solving this damn \nproblem!&rdquo;</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Take them with us.&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;To the island!? Yeah right,&rdquo; Bakugou huffed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m\n doing that. We&rsquo;ll wait for her to wake up and then we&rsquo;re leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'You&rsquo;re really okay with just leaving her behind?&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I already fuckin&rsquo; told you. I&rsquo;m done here.&rdquo;</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'You&rsquo;re an idiot. As always.&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it, Red Scales!&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment he glanced behind \nhimself, seeing her small form lying on the ground. He couldn&rsquo;t take her\n with him&hellip; not anymore. He&rsquo;d let her tag along for far too long, and \nhe was finished.</p><p>~~</p><p>Ochako&rsquo;s body ached and her eyes \nfluttered open. Pressed against her nose was Bakugou&rsquo;s cloak, the fur \ntickling her skin. It smelled nice though, sweet comforting. Over the \npast week, she had grown used to his smell, and took an odd amount of \ncomfort in it.</p><p>She pushed herself up, noting the fire seemed to be dimming, the flames flickering out.</p><p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; Cheeks. Took you long enough to wake up,&rdquo; Bakugou snorted, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bakugou!&rdquo; she gasped, turning around to face him. &ldquo;How long was I out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All\n of yesterday afternoon and night&hellip; It&rsquo;s morning now,&rdquo; Todoroki said \nstretching up. &ldquo;You need to be more careful about how you use your \nmagic.&rdquo;</p><p>Her gaze flicked down towards her staff. &ldquo;I know. I just&hellip; wanted to help.&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki sighed. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do much help if you drain yourself dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;HAH!? You could&rsquo;ve DIED!?&rdquo; Bakugou yelled, standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; technically&hellip;&rdquo; she chuckled awkwardly.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo;\n hell, Uraraka. What the fuck are you thinking?!&rdquo; He ran his hand \nthrough his spiky blond locks, his face twitching with anger.</p><p>She frowned, turning to stand up, glaring at the golden dragon. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to suffer! You were in pain!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n would&rsquo;ve been fuckin&rsquo; fine. Nothing to kill yourself over!&rdquo; he snapped.\n &ldquo;Fuck. You&rsquo;re so fucking reckless, it&rsquo;s a good thing we&rsquo;re leaving soon\n so you can go be normal somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>She froze, her eyebrow furrowing. &ldquo;Leaving?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\n Kirishima and I are going back to our island. We&rsquo;re not sticking \naround&hellip; here!&rdquo; he said, gesturing to the cave. &ldquo;We got shit we gotta \nfigure out.&rdquo;</p><p>Ochako glanced down at Todoroki. &ldquo;But what about us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll figure it out together I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki frowned, pushing himself. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re just going to leave us here in this cave? Far from any human civilization?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have to leave and we&rsquo;ve shown our goddamn dragon forms to enough people!&rdquo; Bakugou hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s a few more?!&rdquo; Todoroki snapped back. &ldquo;We just helped you. Uraraka has given up her life to keep you safe and <i>this</i> is how you&rsquo;re going to treat her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>Kirishima let out a whine, thumping his tail against the ground. He turned towards both mages, a sad look in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip; What are we supposed to do?&rdquo; Ochako said.</p><p>&ldquo;You can go back to your normal boring human life,&rdquo; he snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she yelled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go home! I&rsquo;m not allowed, remember?!&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou rolled his eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my fucking problem. That was your goddamn choice!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We all could&rsquo;ve died trying to rescue your friend,&rdquo; Todoroki stated bluntly.</p><p>&ldquo;Again, you didn&rsquo;t have to fucking help me!&rdquo; he snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;So you could&rsquo;ve handled that on your own?&rdquo; Ochako asked. &ldquo;Excuse me for caring!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to care!&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>&ldquo;And\n what do you plan on doing when you get back to your island? You&rsquo;re \ngoing to have to change forms to get there! Will you be able to fully \ntransform back?&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;The only way you were able to get back to\n normal was by using my magic!&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou froze, glaring at the girl. Did she really think he <i>needed</i> her? Yes, she helped him far more than he wanted her to. And he couldn&rsquo;t deny it was her magic that helped him&hellip; but&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you really just okay with leaving us behind?&rdquo; she said softly.</p><p>Kirishima snorted, huffing as he swung his body around, sitting next to Todoroki and Uraraka.</p><p>&ldquo;Is\n this you trying to tell me you&rsquo;re on their side? You want me to bring \nthem back with us? You really think we can just bring two fuckin&rsquo; <i>humans</i>\n back with us!?&rdquo; Bakugou growled, his long ears twitching against his \nhead. &ldquo;Fucking hell&hellip;&rdquo; He ran his hand through his blond hair again. \n&ldquo;No way. We&rsquo;re not bringing them.&rdquo;</p><p>His gaze fell upon Uraraka, her\n eyes filled to the brim with emotion. Her pupils trembled and he \ncouldn&rsquo;t tell if she was angry or sad.</p><p>&ldquo;F-Fine!&rdquo; she hissed, \nstorming past him before he could speak again. &ldquo;Maybe I don&rsquo;t even want \nto go with you!&rdquo; Her eyes narrowed, glaring at him as she headed towards\n the edge of the cave.</p><p>&ldquo;Uraraka-&rdquo; Todoroki called out, raising his\n hand up after her, but Bakugou was quick to cut him off, realizing what\n he needed to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it Half and Half! I&rsquo;ll go talk to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t\n seem like she wants to talk to you,&rdquo; Todoroki stated, pointing at her \nas she continued towards the entrance of the cave.</p><p>&ldquo;SHUT IT!&rdquo; he yelled, and immediately charged after her. &ldquo;Oi! Cheeks!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave me alone Bakugou!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this what you want?! You&rsquo;ve been trying to get rid of me this entire time!&rdquo;</p><p>He grabbed her arm and tried to stop her but she immediately yanked it away. &ldquo;Uraraka,&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t need you! I don&rsquo;t even want to stay with you!&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes. What a fucking liar she was.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&hellip; you can come with us,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n gee, thanks! How kind of you to allow it! Don&rsquo;t do me any favors, \nBakugou. I&rsquo;m finally taking the hint!&rdquo; she yelled, tears streaming down \nher cheeks.</p><p>As brave and as tough as she was, he knew she really \nhad nowhere to go. Even if she went back with Todoroki, it most likely \nwouldn&rsquo;t feel like home to her. And though she technically chose to \nrescue him, it was still his fault she wasn&rsquo;t allowed to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi&hellip;&rdquo;\n he mumbled, hating how her face looked as she cried. The last thing he \nwanted to do was make her fuckin&rsquo; cry. &ldquo;I&hellip; I want you to come&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-What?&rdquo; she sniffed, wiping her eye on her sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to come with us,&rdquo; he said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;re just saying that!&rdquo; she yelled. Her round cheeks were blotchy and red from crying, her lip trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\n not! I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t ask you to care but you do. If it wasn&rsquo;t for \nyour stupid round cheeks, I&rsquo;d be fucking dead and so would Kirishima,&rdquo; \nhe growled. &ldquo;It&hellip; would be weird to be without you&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You\n would be!&rdquo; she scoffed, folding her arms over her chest. Why did she \nlook so cute when she was being such an indignant little shit?</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! Don&rsquo;t push it!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Just&hellip; fucking come okay? It&rsquo;ll be easier this way.&rdquo;</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. &ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; Sniffing once more, she wiped her eyes again.</p><p>&ldquo;G-Good&hellip;&rdquo;\n he muttered, his cheeks turning a gentle shade of red, even over his \ngolden scales. &ldquo;J-Just&hellip; will you quit crying now?&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;It \ndoesn&rsquo;t look good on your face&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Her pink cheeks grew even pinker, and she smiled. &ldquo;Sorry, Bakugou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi,\n what the hell! Don&rsquo;t apologize! Just don&rsquo;t&hellip; don&rsquo;t do it anymore!&rdquo; he \nscoffed, gently pushing on her forehead with his finger.</p><p>Her lips curled up into a smirk. &ldquo;Admit it&hellip; if you left me behind, you probably would&rsquo;ve missed me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Cheeks. S'got nothing to do with that.&rdquo; Immediately, he turned away from her.</p><p>&ldquo;I bet you would!&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it!&rdquo; he clenched his fists, looking at her cute smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she teased, leaning towards him. &ldquo;Not until you admit it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make you shut up!&rdquo; he snapped, grabbing her cheeks and pulling their lips together.</p><p>She\n froze, a muffled &ldquo;Mmph!&rdquo; slipping from her lips, but after taking a \nmoment to process, she kissed him back. Her mouth pressed against his, \nher hand curling into a fist against his chest. He nipped at her lower, \nfinally giving her a proper kiss after the horrible lip smash she didn&rsquo;t\n remember.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t believe you just kissed me&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered\n when he finally pulled back. Her cheeks were flushed, her gaze flicking\n between his eyes and his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;You did it first,&rdquo; he shrugged, brushing his thumb over her cheek bone.</p><p>&ldquo;What?! No I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said, furrowing her brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he smirked. &ldquo;Guess you don\u2019t remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh!?!&rdquo; she gasped, stepping away from him, cupping her hands over her cheeks. &ldquo;W-When I woke up next to you in the inn&hellip;!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Bakugou nodded, letting her figure it out.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I kissed you?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me you loved me,&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>Her eyes widened, looking as if they were about to pop out of her head. &ldquo;W-W-WHAT!?!?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. You said dragons were so cool,&rdquo; he teased .</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I-I\n meant dragons! O-Obviously! I love DRAGONS! Not you specifically, but \nmore&hellip; by, uh, proxy? Since you&rsquo;re a dragon and all&hellip;!&rdquo; she said, \nshaking her head back and forth rapidly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure Round Face,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;Whatever you say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I bet I didn&rsquo;t even kiss you and you&rsquo;re just&hellip; you&rsquo;re just making it up!&rdquo; she snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. Definitely happened. Does it really matter? We just kissed again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;It&hellip;. it matters!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;\n he snorted, trying to play it as casual as possible. Inside, his heart \nwas throbbing against his chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a fuckin&rsquo; kiss. Look,&rdquo; he \ngrunted and leaned forward and brushed there lips together. &ldquo;We just did\n again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;EH!?&rdquo; she squeaked, her cheeks still bright red. &ldquo;It\u2026 it would&rsquo;ve been my first! Or this one was!&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh&hellip;\n guess I got your first kiss then,&rdquo; he said, shrugging. She stared at \nhis lips again and blushed, backing away. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going. We can\u2019t \nstay in this fucking cave all day.&rdquo; He turned away from her, unable to \nlook at how cute her blushing face was.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Hey! You can&rsquo;t just walk away after kissing me!&rdquo; she yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;I can, and I will,&rdquo; he smirked. &ldquo;We gotta get going. I don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in this cave forever.&rdquo;</p><p>He\n continued back towards Kirishima and Todoroki, both looking confused at\n what transpired between the two of them. From deep in the cave, they \nhadn\u2019t seen what happened between the two.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving,&rdquo; Bakugou said. &ldquo;Get ready to hold on tight, cause Kirishima is going to fly us back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All of us?&rdquo; Todoroki asked, tilting his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Just shut the fuck up and do it.</p><p>Kirishima stomped his foot on the ground, narrowing his eyes at Bakugou.</p><p>&quot;Oh shut up, you know I can&rsquo;t change. I might not be able to change back if I do!&rdquo; he scoffed, folding his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Bakugou!&rdquo; Uraraka yelled, her voice echoing into the depths of the cave.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\n leaving Cheeks,&rdquo; he said, grabbing one of the chains around Kirishima&rsquo;s\n neck as he swung himself onto his back. Todoroki followed his move, \nclimbing onto the red dragon&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;You comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she tapped the bottoms of her feet with her staff. She supposed they would talk about the kiss&hellip; or <i>kisses</i> later.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>",

Or maybe\u2026 it was just that he didn\u2019t \nhate <i>her</i>.</small></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go sign us up,\u201d Uraraka said, gesturing to a long line of men waiting by the entrance. \u201cGet us a seat?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\n nodded, following after Todoroki. The crowd was already rowdy, cheering\n over loud music. Many of them were drinking already, looking jovial and\n ready to celebrate whoever their champion would be.</p><p>The arena was\n dome shaped and covered with large bars, and Bakugou wondered if he and\n Kirishima could break them if they were both in dragon form. He \nsupposed they needed to have some way to keep Kirishima fucking \ncontained.</p><p>He growled, looking at the ceiling. Hopefully Kirishima\n hadn\u2019t lost his fucking mind. If he only had the mind of a dragon, it \nwould make it next to impossible to communicate with him, even if they \nwere both in dragon form.</p><p>\u201cHow is here, Bakugou?\u201d Todoroki asked, \nand he stared at the spot. He didn\u2019t give a shit where they sat, so \ninstead of responding, he plopped his ass down, folding his arms. He \nadjusted the hood on his cloak, making sure it stayed up. The last thing\n he needed was to reveal his shit to the people around them.</p><p>\u201cOi\u2026 Half and Half\u2026\u201d he muttered, folding his arms. \u201cDo you think this is going to work?\u201d</p><p>Todoroki\n blinked, as if he was surprised Bakugou was asking him such a serious \nquestion. He frowned, turning towards the center of the arena. \u201cIf you \nlisten to Uraraka, I think it\u2019ll go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d he grumbled, keeping his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>He fucking hated the idea of having to listen to a goddamn human, but she was convinced this plan would work.</p><p>It\n also meant having to use his dragon form, something he was actively \ntrying to avoid doing. The last thing he needed was to get stuck too. If\n need be, he would force himself to shift back to human form, but it \nwould be unpleasant, and possible drain more magic from himself than \nneeded.</p><p>\u201cBakugou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!?\u201d he growled, snapping from his \nthoughts as he turned to look up at Uraraka. Fuck she was pretty. Her \nhat covered part of her forehead, but her brown hair still brushed \nagainst her round cheeks, the sun a bright backdrop against her cute \nsmile.</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 I asked if you could move over just a bit?\u201d she said.</p><p>Blinking, Bakugou shook his head, pulled from his damn thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he growled, moving closer to Todoroki.</p><p>\u201cI\n signed us up,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThey made fun of me, saying they \ndidn\u2019t think a little girl like me could possibly take on the dragon.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking bullshit. I\u2019d like to see their pansy asses take on a dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 we\u2019re not first\u2026\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo you will get the chance to watch. Hopefully no one else\u2026 is strong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell they will be!\u201d Bakugou snorted and folded his arms.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome\n everyone, to the first annual dragon slaying competition!\u201d A loud voice\n boomed from up on the top of the stands. \u201cI\u2019m the mayor of this fair \ntown, and today many of you have signed up to have the chance to take on\n the great red dragon we have captured. It took many of our ice, ground,\n and fire elemental guard to capture such a large creature and today\u2026 \nYou will have the chance to prove your strength against such a powerful \nbeing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 idiot,\u201d Bakugou growled.</p><p>Before the mayor \ncould continue speaking, there was a loud roar heard in the distance, \nthe entire stadium shaking. Bakugou clenched his fists by his side. It \nwas certainly Kirishima, he would\u2019ve recognized the deafening sound \nanywhere. Though he could tell the sound was painful\u2026 Kirishima\u2019s roar\n didn\u2019t have the normal spark Bakugou was used to.</p><p>\u201cThere you have\n it! The creature approaches! We do hope you know that we have \nconstrained the dragon to the best of our ability, but we cannot be held\n responsible if it attacks or breaks free. Our guard does stand at the \nready,\u201d the man continued.</p><p>The ground shook, and Bakugou narrowed \nhis eyes, watching as the large gates to the arena opened. Men were \npulling on long chains, tugging the creature forward and when Kirishima \nfinally entered the arena, Bakugou stood up, his body trembling with \nanger.</p><p>His wings were chained back, unable to fly even if he \nwanted to. There was a large chain muzzle around his lips, his jaw \nunable to open much wider; no wonder his cry had been so muffled.</p><p>\u201cSit down!\u201d A man behind Bakugou pushed his hand onto his shoulder and Bakugou whipped his head around, glaring.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me what to fucking do, I\u2019ll bite your head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cE-Eesh\u2026\u201d The man blinked, slowly pulling his hand away.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou maybe you should-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at what they\u2019re doing! Of course they\u2019re going to kill him!\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking kill them first!\u201d</p><p>Kirishima\n let out another pained cry, tugging his head back on the chains. A few \nof the men on the ground fell backwards, but even with the movement, \nKirishima didn\u2019t have enough control over his wings. They were torturing\n him, and it was possible they were going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou\u2026 please!\u201d</p><p>Her\n fingers gently wrapped around his hand, giving him a gentle tug. As \nmuch as he wanted to charge out and rescue his friend, he knew it would \ndo him no good to be impatient. Slowly, he lowered himself back down, \ntrembling against the bench.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have your time, Bakugou,\u201d Todoroki said calmly.</p><p>\u201cWe fucking better!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI present to you\u2026 the RED DRAGON!\u201d The mayor called out and the entire audience erupted into a loud cheer.</p><p>Kirishima\n glanced around, smoke huffing from his nostrils as he clearly searched \nfor some way to escape. His wings fluttered, the chains rattling as he \ntried to spread them, finding himself immediately incapable of movement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\n not gonna have a fucking chance\u2026\u201d Bakugou hissed, his fingers curling\n against his pants. How the fuck was he supposed to do anything if he \nwas completely chained up? He wouldn\u2019t be able to use his fire, nor \nwould he be able to fly\u2026</p><p>\u201cFirst up, we have our strongest \nbarbarian! A man from the city! To prove how strong this dragon is\u2026 \nlet\u2019s see how well he fares!\u201d The mayor\u2019s voice was loud and nasally, \ndisgusting to listen to, and Bakugou wondered if all human leaders were \nthis deplorable.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered, watching the man step into \nthe arena with a giant battle axe. His muscles were huge, pulsing as he \nheld the large weapon in his hand.</p><p>Kirishima\u2019s pathetic cry was \nheard throughout the arena and surely farther than that\u2026 even with his\n mouth chained, the sound was booming.</p><p>The man swung his axe and \nKirishima leaped back, his legs collapsing to the ground. The man\u2019s axe \nhit his leg and Kirishima stumbled backwards, bright red blood seeping \nfrom the thick gash in his skin.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Bakugou cursed. \u201cLet\u2019s go now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t\u2026 not yet!\u201d Uraraka hissed.</p><p>Fucking bullshit, they couldn\u2019t-</p><p>With\n another loud roar, the man raised his axe, and Kirishima stomped with \nhis other foot on the ground, causing the man to stumble backwards. It \nwasn\u2019t enough to throw him completely off balance as he charged forward \nagain.</p><p>Kirishima tried to jump back and swing his tail towards the\n man, but the barbarian clipped the edge with his axe. Kirishima\u2019s head \nswung back, his mouth opening slightly while he yelped in pain.</p><p>All around the audience cheered, hollering with joyous laughter for the awful barbarian man.</p><p>\u201cI-I\n can\u2019t watch this,\u201d Uraraka breathed, covering her eyes. He couldn\u2019t \nexactly blame her. Nothing about the fight was fucking fair. Then again,\n if Kirishima was unchained, this man would be dead in a moment.</p><p>The\n man let out a hearty laugh. He lifted his axe once more, charging \nforward as he leaped up. This time, however, Kirishima lowered his head,\n swinging it to the side. He knocked the man straight against the wall. \nHe more than likely would\u2019ve been fine, if he hadn\u2019t been holding the \naxe behind him, it pressed into his back, shooting straight through his \nstomach and chest. Blood spurted from his mouth and his limbs, and he \nimmediately slouched over as he dangled against the wall.</p><p>All around the audience booed and hissed, gasping at such a ghastly sight.</p><p>\u201cGood fucking riddance,\u201d Bakugou snapped.</p><p>\u201cO-Oh\u2026\n the man has come to an unsightly end!\u201d the mayor called sadly. \u201cBut\u2026 \nyou came here to witness fights, and fights you will get. The red beast \nhas been injured, but as you can see, he won\u2019t be giving up anytime \nsoon. Up next we have someone else from out of town, a young mage <i>girl</i>, if she\u2019s still here. After that gruesome battle, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\n still here!\u201d Uraraka\u2019s yell was heard through the stadium, immediately \nquieting the mayor. Everyone turned to stare at her, including Bakugou. \nHis cheeks flushed as he stared at the woman before him; she held her \nstaff against her chest, her brown eyes glaring with determination. \u201cAnd\n I won\u2019t need to <i>kill</i> the dragon to defeat him! Clear a path!\u201d \nshe demanded, watching people on the benches in front of her slowly move\n to the side as she walked forward.</p><p>Her aura was insanely \npowerful, the gravity of it hitting Bakugou in the chest. Silently he \nwondered if she even needed him, with the level of intensity in her \neyes, she could probably get Kirishima to listen on his own.</p><p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d she said, turning around, her hair swinging across her face. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He\n bit his lip, his teeth trembling. She didn\u2019t need to order him the fuck\n around, but he wasn\u2019t about to argue. Not right now. He stood up and \nfollowed her, walking down past the crowd, keeping his gaze down.</p><p>\u201cNot\n going to kill him?\u201d The mayor began to laugh loudly, the crowd quickly \njoining in, but Uraraka\u2019s resolve did not sway. Bakugou watched her gait\n fill with more confidence as they laughed at her.</p><p>She was more than human.</p><p>She was a strong, powerful mage, and nothing was going to stop her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\n right!\u201d she yelled over the laughter. \u201cWhile all of you are hoping to \nhurt this creature,\u201d she said, tapping each foot with her staff. She \ngently floated down into the arena, her feet landing on the dirt. \u201cI\u2019m \ngoing to show there\u2019s no need for that. I\u2026 am dragon tamer and I\u2019m \ngoing to prove it right now.\u201d</p><p>Following after Uraraka, Bakugou hopped down into the dirt, standing directly next to her.</p><p>\u201cOh? And how do you plan to prove that!?\u201d The mayor roared with laughter yet again.</p><p>\u201cWith my dragon right here,\u201d she said, gesturing to Bakugou.</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d Bakugou hissed, narrowing his red eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 deal with it!\u201d she grumbled under her breath.</p><p>The crowd began to murmur, confusion spreading across the large group of people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear, but I think you are sorely mistaken! For that is not a dragon,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s a person!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n really?\u201d she smirked and Bakugou immediately lowered his hood. His \ngolden scales shone in the sunlight, his elongated pointed ears \nglistening against the rays of the morning beams. More murmurs spread \nthrough the crowd, especially from those close to the front who could \nactually see.</p><p>As soon as the hood came off, Kirishima let out a \nroar, raising his feet up to stomp them to the ground. The chains \nrattled against his wings, and Bakugou met his eyes. He nodded once, \nhoping his idiot friend wasn\u2019t actually worried about him; he could tell\n Kirishima wanted him to leave.</p><p>Uraraka turned to Bakugou. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d she whispered, stepping forward to place her hand on his chest.</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 Guess I fucking have to be,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>She\n let her fingers fan out over his heart, pretending as if she was the \none to control his transformation. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d she whispered, her \nbrown eyes filled with concern.</p><p>\u201cQuit worrying, Cheeks. We got this.\u201d </p><p>His\n chest felt warm, a gentle hum trickling under his skin. He stared at \nher for a moment. Was she transferring magic to him? It was faint, but \nhe could feel her magical current pulsing towards his heart. He blushed,\n and wrapped his fingers around her wrist. \u201cStand back\u2026\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Stepping\n away from her, he released his tight hold on his magic, his body \ntrembling with the release. His chest lurched forward, wings immediately\n sprouting from his back. He cried out, the bones and muscles under his \nskin cracking as he fell to the ground, pressing his palms flat against \nthe earth. Claws curled out from his fingertips, scraping against the \nground. He roared again, his jaw elongating and pushing forward.</p><p>He\n was used to the transformation by now. After almost 19 years, he would \nhave to be. It hurt, but Bakugou was mostly numb to the pain. He was \nused to his spine stretching as his golden tail sprouted behind him. He \nwas used to his arms and legs, changing his body and growing rapidly.</p><p>He stood, the transformation complete, and he stared at Kirishima.</p><p><i>\u2018Idiot. What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing getting yourself captured?!\u2019</i>\n he hissed, sending the mental thoughts to Kirishima. Smoke huffed from \nthe tip of his nose and all around him, and he became acutely aware of \nthe audience\u2019s screams.</p><p><i>'Bakugou! What are YOU doing here?!\u2019</i> he said, his voice panicked.</p><p>A\n rush of relief washed over Bakugou, happy Kirishima could understand \nhis spoken thoughts. He hadn\u2019t lost himself completely to the beast.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Fucking hell. I came for you. We have to go back.\u2019</i>\n</p><p>Kirishima fluttered his wings pathetically. <i>'I-I can\u2019t!\u2019</i> he stammered. <i>'I can\u2019t change back!\u2019</i></p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'I had a feeling\u2026\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Uraraka began, and Bakguou\u2019s gaze snapped down \nto her. Right. He was supposed to be fucking listening to her or \nwhatever\u2026 \u201cThis is my dragon, and he obeys my commands.\u201d</p><p>Obeys?! She was really fucking milking this for all it was worth, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>He huffed again, smoke puffing out of his nostrils.</p><p><i>'Who is this girl? What are you doing? Are you really under her control!?\u2019</i> Kirishima asked, rushing through a list of questions.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Of course not dumb ass! She\u2019s helping me rescue your stupid face! If you listen to her, we can probably get you out!\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'So you want me to play along?\u2019</i>\n</p><p><i>'Yeah just\u2026 fucking listen to her for now.\u2019</i> Bakugou nodded, leaning his head down to her.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re being so submissive!\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Shut the fuck up!\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cHow can you prove that he won\u2019t attack you?\u201d the mayor called out and Bakugou turned his head, huffing out a breath of smoke.</p><p>\u201cClearly,\n he\u2019s not attacking me or anyone right now!\u201d she laughed and gently \npressed her hand up against his snout. With a grunt, he nuzzled her.</p><p>\u201cCan\n you control when he attacks?\u201d There was something about the mayor\u2019s \nvoice; it trembled with a deep fear, and that made Bakugou smirk with \npride.</p><p>\u201cYes. Bakugou\u2026 fire!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>The hell!? She\n wanted him to use that much magic!? He let out a growl and stood up, \nshooting flames into the arena. They fell against the dirt and flickered\n before Bakugou stepped on them with his large foot to put it out. The \nlast thing he needed was them thinking they were hostile.</p><p>\u201cYou \nare\u2026 quite powerful\u2026 young lady,\u201d the mayor said, and Bakugou turned\n to face him. A dark look came over his eyes. Something wasn\u2019t right. \nBakugou could tell this man wasn\u2019t going to listen to Uraraka in the way\n she hoped. He immediately stepped in front of her, hoping to stop any \nattacks that came her way. \u201cELEMENTAL GUARDS!\u201d the mayor yelled, \npointing directly at Bakugou.</p><p>Uraraka gasped, clutching her staff \nto her chest and she turned her head just in time to hear more members \nof the audience scream as Todoroki held his hand out, making an ice \nslide down to the arena.</p><p>\u201cT-Todoroki!\u201d she yelled, now standing next to him as he landed in the arena next to her.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 we can\u2019t leave Kirishima!\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\n was quick to spread his wings, puffing out smoke as he spat a ring of \nfire around them, blockading them from the charging guards.</p><p>\u201cIf \nthey have water elementals, this isn\u2019t going to last very long,\u201d \nTodoroki murmured, rushing towards Kirishima. \u201cWe might be able to cut \nthrough the chains with my ice. Do you have any offensive spells?\u201d he \nasked.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d she muttered. \u201cOnly healing magic!\u201d she gasped, shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try ice. If we can at least break the ones on his wings we can get him out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she said. \u201cThe arena is covered!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d he muttered, glancing around. \u201cLet\u2019s at least get the chains off and then we can try and find an escape route.\u201d</p><p>As\n the two approached, Kirishima bucked backwards, tossing his legs into \nthe air and shaking his head, the chains rattling against his back.</p><p><i>'They\u2019re gonna fucking help you, moron!\u2019</i>\n Bakugou huffed. He turned his head towards the sky. He could possibly \nbreak the structure if he slammed his back against the large metal beams\n covering the surface.</p><p>Pressing his feet close to the ground, he \nlaunched himself into the air, the wind from his wings pushing the fire \nout and causing the guards to fall backwards. Idiots. Did they really \nthink they could beat his fire?</p><p>\u201cWAVE!\u201d One of the guards called out, a giant rush of water pushing towards the flames.</p><p>Fucking shitty humans and their shitty magic!</p><p>Bakugou\n pushed his back against the metal, crying out loudly when he hit \nagainst the bars. It hurt, but it certainly made a dent. If they could \nget the chains off of Kirishima\u2019s wings, the two of them could probably \ndo it together.</p><p>As they ran close to Kirishima, Uraraka held her \nstaff out. \u201cI\u2019ll get us higher!\u201d she breathed. She never used her \ngravity magic on two people before, but desperate times called for \ndesperate measures.</p><p>\u201cFLOAT!\u201d she cried out, tapping both of \nTodoroki\u2019s feet. He began to rise, his hair floating upwards. \u201cF-FLOAT!\u201d\n she called out once more, tapping her own two feet. She reached for \nTodoroki\u2019s hand, pushing herself off of the ground, she flung them up \nwith momentum, the two of them landing on Kirishima\u2019s wing.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Uraraka?\u201d Todoroki asked, looking at her with concern.</p><p>\u201cF-Fine,\u201d she gasped, kneeling on Kirishima\u2019s wing.</p><p>He\n nodded, knowing they didn\u2019t stand a chance if they kept wasting time. \n\u201cFreeze!\u201d he cried out and ice wrapped around Kirishima\u2019s wing, the cold\n substance covering his red, scaly skin.</p><p>\u201cWAVE!\u201d More guards were \narriving, waves of water covering the flames Bakugou kept attempting to \nreplenish. Uraraka glanced up, watching Bakugou push against the metal \nbeams. He looked exhausted, and she was worried he was using too much of\n his magic. Either way, she supposed him overworking himself a little \nwas better than them all dying.</p><p>The red dragon cried out and began\n to flap his wing, the ice starting to crack against the metal, the \nchains about the snap. Todoroki leaped forward, landing directly on \nKirishima\u2019s back. He held his hand out, casting the spell to wrap the \nice around his other wing.</p><p>The dragon rolled his back, shaking out as his entire body shivered, bucking underneath the smaller humans.</p><p>\u201cFREEZE!\u201d Guards called out, shooting ice in the direction of Kirishima.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Uraraka cried, gesturing towards the ice headed directly towards them.</p><p>He\n whipped his body around, holding his other hand out as he felt the \nchains heat up against his hand. \u201cFIRE!\u201d he yelled, shooting flames from\n the jewels against his palm, the flames melting the ice it immediately \ncame into contact with.</p><p>\u201cUraraka!\u201d Todoroki cried out, holding his other hand out to her. \u201cWe have to hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cR-Right,\u201d\n she cried out, jumping forward to take his hand. She clung to him hard \nas Kirishima\u2019s wings spread, breaking the frozen ice.</p><p>Todoroki lunged forward, grabbing at one of the chains around his neck as he clung to Uraraka hard. \u201cHold on,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she gasped as Kirishima pushed into the air.</p><p>The\n two dragons nodded to each other, slamming their backs against the \nmetal bars. Bakugou huffed, shooting flames down at the guards in front \nof him. The dragon\u2019s fire was far more overpowering than Todoroki\u2019s, and\n any ice that shot their way was far too small and not high enough to \nreach them.</p><p>With another slam, the bars bent upwards, leaving enough space for them to escape, dashing into the air.</p><p>Uraraka\n clung to Todoroki, the wind whipping against her cheeks as she slammed \nher eyes shut, hoping they would land somewhere far, far away from any \nother villages or towns.</p><p>~~</p><p>It took about an hour of flying \nto get anywhere away from civilization. They flew over towns and \nvillages and Ochako was certain rumors would be flying now.</p><p>As \nthey made their way towards the mountains, Bakugou nodded his head \ntowards a large cave on the side, flying down towards it, landing \nagainst the large ledge.</p><p>Kirishima followed closely behind and \nwhen he pressed his feet to the ground, he bowed his head down, allowing\n Ochako and Todoroki to slip down to the ground.</p><p>Her brown hair \nfluttered about her face and Todoroki\u2019s looked as it had been slicked \nback, the force of the wind was so strong high in the sky.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe we made it\u2026\u201d Ochako whispered, her hands trembling against her staff.</p><p>\u201cSame\u2026\u201d\n Todoroki muttered and quickly turned around towards Kirishima. \u201cI could\n probably freeze the muzzle off in the same way if you don\u2019t mind your \nmouth being cold.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima\u2019s ears perked up and he leaned down, \ncrouching close the ground. Holding his palm out, Todoroki breathed the \nword out and ice curled around Kirishima\u2019s snout, freezing the chains. \n\u201cGive it a moment and you should be able to break them with your jaw.\u201d</p><p>Ochako turned towards Bakugou, wondering if he would be able to change back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, stepping towards him.</p><p>He growled, turning his head away from her for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf you can\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>He\n let out another growl, his body lurching forward as he began to shrink \nback to his human form. Immediately, he fell to his knees, his chest \nheaving, coughs slipping between his lips.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou!\u201d she \ngasped, running to him. Scales littered his face once again, his long \nears twitching as he tried to catch his breath. \u201cYou\u2019re in pain,\u201d she \nsaid softly.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m fucking fine!\u201d he snapped, his body \nalmost completely back to normal minus the scales on his face, his ears \nand his dragon wings. \u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d she begged. \u201cPlease let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\n can\u2019t!\u201d he hissed, feebly attempting to pull away from her. \u201cYou can\u2019t \nfucking give me magic, so what the hell do you plan on doing!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I heal you, you can pull your wings back\u2026 at the very least.\u201d</p><p>His\n wings fluttered behind him, his face wincing. They looked heavy against\n his body, and his panting grew heavier. \u201cFuck. Do\u2026 whatever you want.\n It\u2019s not going to work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-It might,\u201d she whispered, pressing \nher hand to his chest. Her hand felt heated, the small hum of magic \nreturning under her palm. She pressed her staff over his heart, and shut\n her eyes. \u201cCure,\u201d she whispered, her palm feeling hot.</p><p>\u201cNgh\u2026\u201d \nhe grunted, his head dropping back. He winced, his back arching as his \nwings slowly began to fold back towards his body. The large bruises on \nhis back slowly disappeared, and the searing pain in his chest, back, \nand neck dissipated as well.</p><p>This woman\u2026 had far more magical \nability than she let on. How could such a small body hold so much power?\n He didn\u2019t underestimate her, never had, and definitely never would. \nWatching her walk into the arena with such confidence earlier was hard \nto ignore\u2026 and even now, watching her be so certain about what her \npower could do. It was something she never tried, and yet she was so \nconfident she could help his transformation.</p><p>And she was right apparently.</p><p>Ochako\n swallowed, her brown eyes turning up towards him. \u201cT-There\u2026\u201d she \nwhispered. Her hand pressed against his chest as she tried to push back.\n Her arm trembled and her breathing grew heavy. \u201cI\u2019m glad you could\u2026 \ns-shift just\u2026 a little more\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi! What did you do?\u201d Bakugou growled.</p><p>\u201cI-I healed you\u2026\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\n used too much magic, didn\u2019t you!?\u201d Snapping at her, he shook her \nshoulders in an attempt to keep her awake. But her eyes fluttered shut, \nand her head rolled forward. \u201cUraraka!\u201d Bakugou yelled as she slumped \nagainst him, completely passed out.</p><p>\u201cOi! Half and Half!\u201d Bakugou yelled. \u201cSomethin\u2019s wrong with Cheeks!\u201d</p><p>Todoroki\n glanced away from Kirishima, closing his palm. The ice was settling \naround the muzzle and he nodded, letting the dragon wait. He pushed up, \nwalking over to Bakugou, his eyes widening when he saw her face pressed \nagainst Bakugou\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking know!\u201d Bakugou yelled. \u201cShe started healing me to help me shift back and then she fuckin\u2019 just\u2026 passed out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe overused her magic,\u201d Todoroki muttered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how the hell that\u2019s even possible, since you idiots don\u2019t use magic through your fucking bodies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\n not exactly. The source of magic doesn\u2019t come from our bodies, no, but \nthe magical current flows through us when we activate the items we use. \nSo technically it does use her energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026I did feel an odd hum \nagainst her hand when she used her goddamn magic. I told her she didn\u2019t \nhave to!\u201d he growled, holding her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2026 A weird hum?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, when she had her hand on my chest,\u201d Bakugou snapped, his gaze fixated on the girl in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\n Todoroki tapped his chin, looking at the two of them. It was odd\u2026 \nsomething like that shouldn\u2019t have come from her hand, but her staff \nrather. \u201cI\u2019ll get a fire started,\u201d he said, backing away. \u201cLet her rest,\n her energy will replenish and she will wake up.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah\u2026\u201d Bakugou muttered, his hand touching her brown hair.</p><p>He\n cared about her far more than he let on. Even after the fire started, \nit took Bakugou a moment to lay her down, covering her with his cloak.</p><p>\u201cWatch her,\u201d he demanded, pointing to Todoroki.</p><p>\u201cI will, you have nothing to worry about. She just needs sleep,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2026\u201d he grumbled, heading away from the fire and out onto the ledge. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Kirishima.\u201d</p><p>With\n the muzzle having been frozen off, Kirishima only had a chain around \nhis neck, his body able to move as freely as possible. He turned his \nhead towards the two humans, and glanced back at Bakugou who was \ntraipsing towards the edge of the cave. He plopped down on the edge, \ndangling his legs over the side.</p><p>Kirishima followed, laying down next to him, curling his tail to the side.</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave,\u201d Bakugou said.</p><p><i>'So fast? You\u2019re going to miss that human girl!\u2019</i> Kirishima\u2019s tone was taunting, and his head moved up and down with his laughter.</p><p>\u201cShut it!\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fucking miss her. We have bigger problems. You can\u2019t change back can you?\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'No\u2026 I thought if I was away from that village I might be able to when things calmed down but\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cFucking\u2026 dammit!\u201d he hissed, slamming his fist against the \nstone ground. \u201cHumans\u2026 aren\u2019t stealing our magic. They can\u2019t even use \nit on their own.\u201d</p><p><i>'What!?\u2019</i> Kirishima lifted his head, glancing back at the two human mages inside the cave.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\n They need a fucking\u2026 I dunno\u2026 magical object or some bullshit!\u201d He \ngestured back towards them. \u201cThat\u2019s why Half and Half has those weird \nhand things and Cheeks has the staff,\u201d he said.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'How\u2026 did you meet them exactly?\u2019</i>\n</p><p>Bakugou rubbed his forehead. \u201cLook my magic isn\u2019t doing great \neither and I got captured in a village\u2026 but Cheeks has some kind of \ndragon fetish so she rescued me. It got her banished from her town and \nwe went to the city to find Half and Half, another dragon fanatic. He \nheard rumors of you and I came to fucking get you. The end. Now we have \nto go home, we don\u2019t have time to dick around here worrying about \nhumans.\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Wait\u2026 you got her banished from her town and you\u2019re just\u2026 gonna ditch her!? She saved you, dude!\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell else am I supposed to do?\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m done \nhanging out with humans and we\u2019re not any closer to solving this damn \nproblem!\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Take them with us.\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cTo the island!? Yeah right,\u201d Bakugou huffed. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m\n doing that. We\u2019ll wait for her to wake up and then we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'You\u2019re really okay with just leaving her behind?\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cYeah. I already fuckin\u2019 told you. I\u2019m done here.\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'You\u2019re an idiot. As always.\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cShut it, Red Scales!\u201d</p><p>For a moment he glanced behind \nhimself, seeing her small form lying on the ground. He couldn\u2019t take her\n with him\u2026 not anymore. He\u2019d let her tag along for far too long, and \nhe was finished.</p><p>~~</p><p>Ochako\u2019s body ached and her eyes \nfluttered open. Pressed against her nose was Bakugou\u2019s cloak, the fur \ntickling her skin. It smelled nice though, sweet comforting. Over the \npast week, she had grown used to his smell, and took an odd amount of \ncomfort in it.</p><p>She pushed herself up, noting the fire seemed to be dimming, the flames flickering out.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 Cheeks. Took you long enough to wake up,\u201d Bakugou snorted, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou!\u201d she gasped, turning around to face him. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\n of yesterday afternoon and night\u2026 It\u2019s morning now,\u201d Todoroki said \nstretching up. \u201cYou need to be more careful about how you use your \nmagic.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked down towards her staff. \u201cI know. I just\u2026 wanted to help.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki sighed. \u201cYou won\u2019t do much help if you drain yourself dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHAH!? You could\u2019ve DIED!?\u201d Bakugou yelled, standing up.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 technically\u2026\u201d she chuckled awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019\n hell, Uraraka. What the fuck are you thinking?!\u201d He ran his hand \nthrough his spiky blond locks, his face twitching with anger.</p><p>She frowned, turning to stand up, glaring at the golden dragon. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to suffer! You were in pain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n would\u2019ve been fuckin\u2019 fine. Nothing to kill yourself over!\u201d he snapped.\n \u201cFuck. You\u2019re so fucking reckless, it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re leaving soon\n so you can go be normal somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She froze, her eyebrow furrowing. \u201cLeaving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\n Kirishima and I are going back to our island. We\u2019re not sticking \naround\u2026 here!\u201d he said, gesturing to the cave. \u201cWe got shit we gotta \nfigure out.\u201d</p><p>Ochako glanced down at Todoroki. \u201cBut what about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out together I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki frowned, pushing himself. \u201cSo you\u2019re just going to leave us here in this cave? Far from any human civilization?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave and we\u2019ve shown our goddamn dragon forms to enough people!\u201d Bakugou hissed.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s a few more?!\u201d Todoroki snapped back. \u201cWe just helped you. Uraraka has given up her life to keep you safe and <i>this</i> is how you\u2019re going to treat her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTodoroki\u2026\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Kirishima let out a whine, thumping his tail against the ground. He turned towards both mages, a sad look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 What are we supposed to do?\u201d Ochako said.</p><p>\u201cYou can go back to your normal boring human life,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t go home! I\u2019m not allowed, remember?!\u201d</p><p>Bakugou rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not my fucking problem. That was your goddamn choice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all could\u2019ve died trying to rescue your friend,\u201d Todoroki stated bluntly.</p><p>\u201cAgain, you didn\u2019t have to fucking help me!\u201d he snorted.</p><p>\u201cSo you could\u2019ve handled that on your own?\u201d Ochako asked. \u201cExcuse me for caring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to care!\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cAnd\n what do you plan on doing when you get back to your island? You\u2019re \ngoing to have to change forms to get there! Will you be able to fully \ntransform back?\u201d she scoffed. \u201cThe only way you were able to get back to\n normal was by using my magic!\u201d</p><p>Bakugou froze, glaring at the girl. Did she really think he <i>needed</i> her? Yes, she helped him far more than he wanted her to. And he couldn\u2019t deny it was her magic that helped him\u2026 but\u2026</p><p>\u201cAre you really just okay with leaving us behind?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Kirishima snorted, huffing as he swung his body around, sitting next to Todoroki and Uraraka.</p><p>\u201cIs\n this you trying to tell me you\u2019re on their side? You want me to bring \nthem back with us? You really think we can just bring two fuckin\u2019 <i>humans</i>\n back with us!?\u201d Bakugou growled, his long ears twitching against his \nhead. \u201cFucking hell\u2026\u201d He ran his hand through his blond hair again. \n\u201cNo way. We\u2019re not bringing them.\u201d</p><p>His gaze fell upon Uraraka, her\n eyes filled to the brim with emotion. Her pupils trembled and he \ncouldn\u2019t tell if she was angry or sad.</p><p>\u201cF-Fine!\u201d she hissed, \nstorming past him before he could speak again. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t even want \nto go with you!\u201d Her eyes narrowed, glaring at him as she headed towards\n the edge of the cave.</p><p>\u201cUraraka-\u201d Todoroki called out, raising his\n hand up after her, but Bakugou was quick to cut him off, realizing what\n he needed to do.</p><p>\u201cShut it Half and Half! I\u2019ll go talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t\n seem like she wants to talk to you,\u201d Todoroki stated, pointing at her \nas she continued towards the entrance of the cave.</p><p>\u201cSHUT IT!\u201d he yelled, and immediately charged after her. \u201cOi! Cheeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone Bakugou!\u201d she snapped. \u201cIsn\u2019t this what you want?! You\u2019ve been trying to get rid of me this entire time!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm and tried to stop her but she immediately yanked it away. \u201cUraraka,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI-I don\u2019t need you! I don\u2019t even want to stay with you!\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. What a fucking liar she was.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2026 you can come with us,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh\n gee, thanks! How kind of you to allow it! Don\u2019t do me any favors, \nBakugou. I\u2019m finally taking the hint!\u201d she yelled, tears streaming down \nher cheeks.</p><p>As brave and as tough as she was, he knew she really \nhad nowhere to go. Even if she went back with Todoroki, it most likely \nwouldn\u2019t feel like home to her. And though she technically chose to \nrescue him, it was still his fault she wasn\u2019t allowed to go home.</p><p>\u201cOi\u2026\u201d\n he mumbled, hating how her face looked as she cried. The last thing he \nwanted to do was make her fuckin\u2019 cry. \u201cI\u2026 I want you to come\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d she sniffed, wiping her eye on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come with us,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re just saying that!\u201d she yelled. Her round cheeks were blotchy and red from crying, her lip trembling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\n not! I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t ask you to care but you do. If it wasn\u2019t for \nyour stupid round cheeks, I\u2019d be fucking dead and so would Kirishima,\u201d \nhe growled. \u201cIt\u2026 would be weird to be without you\u2026\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cY-You\n would be!\u201d she scoffed, folding her arms over her chest. Why did she \nlook so cute when she was being such an indignant little shit?</p><p>\u201cOi! Don\u2019t push it!\u201d he growled. \u201cJust\u2026 fucking come okay? It\u2019ll be easier this way.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Sniffing once more, she wiped her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cG-Good\u2026\u201d\n he muttered, his cheeks turning a gentle shade of red, even over his \ngolden scales. \u201cJ-Just\u2026 will you quit crying now?\u201d he snapped. \u201cIt \ndoesn\u2019t look good on your face\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her pink cheeks grew even pinker, and she smiled. \u201cSorry, Bakugou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi,\n what the hell! Don\u2019t apologize! Just don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t do it anymore!\u201d he \nscoffed, gently pushing on her forehead with his finger.</p><p>Her lips curled up into a smirk. \u201cAdmit it\u2026 if you left me behind, you probably would\u2019ve missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cheeks. S'got nothing to do with that.\u201d Immediately, he turned away from her.</p><p>\u201cI bet you would!\u201d she giggled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it!\u201d he clenched his fists, looking at her cute smile.</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d she teased, leaning towards him. \u201cNot until you admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll make you shut up!\u201d he snapped, grabbing her cheeks and pulling their lips together.</p><p>She\n froze, a muffled \u201cMmph!\u201d slipping from her lips, but after taking a \nmoment to process, she kissed him back. Her mouth pressed against his, \nher hand curling into a fist against his chest. He nipped at her lower, \nfinally giving her a proper kiss after the horrible lip smash she didn\u2019t\n remember.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you just kissed me\u2026\u201d she whispered\n when he finally pulled back. Her cheeks were flushed, her gaze flicking\n between his eyes and his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou did it first,\u201d he shrugged, brushing his thumb over her cheek bone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! No I didn\u2019t!\u201d she said, furrowing her brow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he smirked. \u201cGuess you don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh!?!\u201d she gasped, stepping away from him, cupping her hands over her cheeks. \u201cW-When I woke up next to you in the inn\u2026!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bakugou nodded, letting her figure it out.</p><p>\u201cI-I kissed you?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you loved me,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>Her eyes widened, looking as if they were about to pop out of her head. \u201cW-W-WHAT!?!?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm. You said dragons were so cool,\u201d he teased .</p><p>\u201c\u2026I-I\n meant dragons! O-Obviously! I love DRAGONS! Not you specifically, but \nmore\u2026 by, uh, proxy? Since you\u2019re a dragon and all\u2026!\u201d she said, \nshaking her head back and forth rapidly.</p><p>\u201cSure Round Face,\u201d he grinned. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I bet I didn\u2019t even kiss you and you\u2019re just\u2026 you\u2019re just making it up!\u201d she snorted.</p><p>\u201cNope. Definitely happened. Does it really matter? We just kissed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2026. it matters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\n he snorted, trying to play it as casual as possible. Inside, his heart \nwas throbbing against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fuckin\u2019 kiss. Look,\u201d he \ngrunted and leaned forward and brushed there lips together. \u201cWe just did\n again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEH!?\u201d she squeaked, her cheeks still bright red. \u201cIt\u2026 it would\u2019ve been my first! Or this one was!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\n guess I got your first kiss then,\u201d he said, shrugging. She stared at \nhis lips again and blushed, backing away. \u201cLet\u2019s get going. We can\u2019t \nstay in this fucking cave all day.\u201d He turned away from her, unable to \nlook at how cute her blushing face was.</p><p>\u201cH-Hey! You can\u2019t just walk away after kissing me!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will,\u201d he smirked. \u201cWe gotta get going. I don\u2019t want to be stuck in this cave forever.\u201d</p><p>He\n continued back towards Kirishima and Todoroki, both looking confused at\n what transpired between the two of them. From deep in the cave, they \nhadn\u2019t seen what happened between the two.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Bakugou said. \u201cGet ready to hold on tight, cause Kirishima is going to fly us back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us?\u201d Todoroki asked, tilting his head.</p><p>\u201cJust shut the fuck up and do it.</p><p>Kirishima stomped his foot on the ground, narrowing his eyes at Bakugou.</p><p>\"Oh shut up, you know I can\u2019t change. I might not be able to change back if I do!\u201d he scoffed, folding his arms.</p><p>\u201cBakugou!\u201d Uraraka yelled, her voice echoing into the depths of the cave.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\n leaving Cheeks,\u201d he said, grabbing one of the chains around Kirishima\u2019s\n neck as he swung himself onto his back. Todoroki followed his move, \nclimbing onto the red dragon\u2019s back. \u201cYou comin\u2019?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she tapped the bottoms of her feet with her staff. She supposed they would talk about the kiss\u2026 or <i>kisses</i> later.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>",

Now an adult and professional mage, \nshe\u2019s ready to help her parents as a healer for their village. The last \nthing she expects is for her beliefs to become a reality, but when a \ndragon attacks her village, she learns there\u2019s more to magic than she \never could\u2019ve realized.<br><br><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16804609/chapters/41365580\">Read on AO3</a><br><br>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z3xF4a7jao2Xy-1acpZzw\">@its-love-u-asshole</a> for reading this over. <br></small></p><p><small>With a huff, Bakugou followed Uraraka and Todoroki to a large covered\n arena the townsfolk prepared for the dragon battle. Apparently this \ntown enjoyed tournaments and sports, and many people spent their time \ngambling here\u2026 it was possibly the worst place Kirishima could\u2019ve \nended up.</small></p><p><small>He wrinkled his nose when they stepped into the arena, \nthe loud cheers and murmurings of humans hurting his ears. Deplorable \nfucking creatures. How the hell did they think it was okay to hurt an \nendangered creature. Did humans find something rare and immediately want\n to be rid of it?</small></p><p><small>He glanced at Uraraka, gesturing to Todoroki \nabout something, he couldn\u2019t hear her over the large roaring of the \ncrowd. He supposed not all humans were bad, and perhaps it wasn\u2019t fair \nfor him to make an assumption. Or maybe\u2026 it was just that he didn\u2019t \nhate <i>her</i>.</small></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go sign us up,\u201d Uraraka said, gesturing to a long line of men waiting by the entrance. \u201cGet us a seat?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\n nodded, following after Todoroki. The crowd was already rowdy, cheering\n over loud music. Many of them were drinking already, looking jovial and\n ready to celebrate whoever their champion would be.</p><p>The arena was\n dome shaped and covered with large bars, and Bakugou wondered if he and\n Kirishima could break them if they were both in dragon form. He \nsupposed they needed to have some way to keep Kirishima fucking \ncontained.</p><p>He growled, looking at the ceiling. Hopefully Kirishima\n hadn\u2019t lost his fucking mind. If he only had the mind of a dragon, it \nwould make it next to impossible to communicate with him, even if they \nwere both in dragon form.</p><p>\u201cHow is here, Bakugou?\u201d Todoroki asked, \nand he stared at the spot. He didn\u2019t give a shit where they sat, so \ninstead of responding, he plopped his ass down, folding his arms. He \nadjusted the hood on his cloak, making sure it stayed up. The last thing\n he needed was to reveal his shit to the people around them.</p><p>\u201cOi\u2026 Half and Half\u2026\u201d he muttered, folding his arms. \u201cDo you think this is going to work?\u201d</p><p>Todoroki\n blinked, as if he was surprised Bakugou was asking him such a serious \nquestion. He frowned, turning towards the center of the arena. \u201cIf you \nlisten to Uraraka, I think it\u2019ll go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d he grumbled, keeping his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>He fucking hated the idea of having to listen to a goddamn human, but she was convinced this plan would work.</p><p>It\n also meant having to use his dragon form, something he was actively \ntrying to avoid doing. The last thing he needed was to get stuck too. If\n need be, he would force himself to shift back to human form, but it \nwould be unpleasant, and possible drain more magic from himself than \nneeded.</p><p>\u201cBakugou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!?\u201d he growled, snapping from his \nthoughts as he turned to look up at Uraraka. Fuck she was pretty. Her \nhat covered part of her forehead, but her brown hair still brushed \nagainst her round cheeks, the sun a bright backdrop against her cute \nsmile.</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 I asked if you could move over just a bit?\u201d she said.</p><p>Blinking, Bakugou shook his head, pulled from his damn thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he growled, moving closer to Todoroki.</p><p>\u201cI\n signed us up,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThey made fun of me, saying they \ndidn\u2019t think a little girl like me could possibly take on the dragon.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking bullshit. I\u2019d like to see their pansy asses take on a dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 we\u2019re not first\u2026\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo you will get the chance to watch. Hopefully no one else\u2026 is strong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell they will be!\u201d Bakugou snorted and folded his arms.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome\n everyone, to the first annual dragon slaying competition!\u201d A loud voice\n boomed from up on the top of the stands. \u201cI\u2019m the mayor of this fair \ntown, and today many of you have signed up to have the chance to take on\n the great red dragon we have captured. It took many of our ice, ground,\n and fire elemental guard to capture such a large creature and today\u2026 \nYou will have the chance to prove your strength against such a powerful \nbeing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 idiot,\u201d Bakugou growled.</p><p>Before the mayor \ncould continue speaking, there was a loud roar heard in the distance, \nthe entire stadium shaking. Bakugou clenched his fists by his side. It \nwas certainly Kirishima, he would\u2019ve recognized the deafening sound \nanywhere. Though he could tell the sound was painful\u2026 Kirishima\u2019s roar\n didn\u2019t have the normal spark Bakugou was used to.</p><p>\u201cThere you have\n it! The creature approaches! We do hope you know that we have \nconstrained the dragon to the best of our ability, but we cannot be held\n responsible if it attacks or breaks free. Our guard does stand at the \nready,\u201d the man continued.</p><p>The ground shook, and Bakugou narrowed \nhis eyes, watching as the large gates to the arena opened. Men were \npulling on long chains, tugging the creature forward and when Kirishima \nfinally entered the arena, Bakugou stood up, his body trembling with \nanger.</p><p>His wings were chained back, unable to fly even if he \nwanted to. There was a large chain muzzle around his lips, his jaw \nunable to open much wider; no wonder his cry had been so muffled.</p><p>\u201cSit down!\u201d A man behind Bakugou pushed his hand onto his shoulder and Bakugou whipped his head around, glaring.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me what to fucking do, I\u2019ll bite your head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cE-Eesh\u2026\u201d The man blinked, slowly pulling his hand away.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou maybe you should-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at what they\u2019re doing! Of course they\u2019re going to kill him!\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking kill them first!\u201d</p><p>Kirishima\n let out another pained cry, tugging his head back on the chains. A few \nof the men on the ground fell backwards, but even with the movement, \nKirishima didn\u2019t have enough control over his wings. They were torturing\n him, and it was possible they were going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou\u2026 please!\u201d</p><p>Her\n fingers gently wrapped around his hand, giving him a gentle tug. As \nmuch as he wanted to charge out and rescue his friend, he knew it would \ndo him no good to be impatient. Slowly, he lowered himself back down, \ntrembling against the bench.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have your time, Bakugou,\u201d Todoroki said calmly.</p><p>\u201cWe fucking better!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI present to you\u2026 the RED DRAGON!\u201d The mayor called out and the entire audience erupted into a loud cheer.</p><p>Kirishima\n glanced around, smoke huffing from his nostrils as he clearly searched \nfor some way to escape. His wings fluttered, the chains rattling as he \ntried to spread them, finding himself immediately incapable of movement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\n not gonna have a fucking chance\u2026\u201d Bakugou hissed, his fingers curling\n against his pants. How the fuck was he supposed to do anything if he \nwas completely chained up? He wouldn\u2019t be able to use his fire, nor \nwould he be able to fly\u2026</p><p>\u201cFirst up, we have our strongest \nbarbarian! A man from the city! To prove how strong this dragon is\u2026 \nlet\u2019s see how well he fares!\u201d The mayor\u2019s voice was loud and nasally, \ndisgusting to listen to, and Bakugou wondered if all human leaders were \nthis deplorable.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered, watching the man step into \nthe arena with a giant battle axe. His muscles were huge, pulsing as he \nheld the large weapon in his hand.</p><p>Kirishima\u2019s pathetic cry was \nheard throughout the arena and surely farther than that\u2026 even with his\n mouth chained, the sound was booming.</p><p>The man swung his axe and \nKirishima leaped back, his legs collapsing to the ground. The man\u2019s axe \nhit his leg and Kirishima stumbled backwards, bright red blood seeping \nfrom the thick gash in his skin.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Bakugou cursed. \u201cLet\u2019s go now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t\u2026 not yet!\u201d Uraraka hissed.</p><p>Fucking bullshit, they couldn\u2019t-</p><p>With\n another loud roar, the man raised his axe, and Kirishima stomped with \nhis other foot on the ground, causing the man to stumble backwards. It \nwasn\u2019t enough to throw him completely off balance as he charged forward \nagain.</p><p>Kirishima tried to jump back and swing his tail towards the\n man, but the barbarian clipped the edge with his axe. Kirishima\u2019s head \nswung back, his mouth opening slightly while he yelped in pain.</p><p>All around the audience cheered, hollering with joyous laughter for the awful barbarian man.</p><p>\u201cI-I\n can\u2019t watch this,\u201d Uraraka breathed, covering her eyes. He couldn\u2019t \nexactly blame her. Nothing about the fight was fucking fair. Then again,\n if Kirishima was unchained, this man would be dead in a moment.</p><p>The\n man let out a hearty laugh. He lifted his axe once more, charging \nforward as he leaped up. This time, however, Kirishima lowered his head,\n swinging it to the side. He knocked the man straight against the wall. \nHe more than likely would\u2019ve been fine, if he hadn\u2019t been holding the \naxe behind him, it pressed into his back, shooting straight through his \nstomach and chest. Blood spurted from his mouth and his limbs, and he \nimmediately slouched over as he dangled against the wall.</p><p>All around the audience booed and hissed, gasping at such a ghastly sight.</p><p>\u201cGood fucking riddance,\u201d Bakugou snapped.</p><p>\u201cO-Oh\u2026\n the man has come to an unsightly end!\u201d the mayor called sadly. \u201cBut\u2026 \nyou came here to witness fights, and fights you will get. The red beast \nhas been injured, but as you can see, he won\u2019t be giving up anytime \nsoon. Up next we have someone else from out of town, a young mage <i>girl</i>, if she\u2019s still here. After that gruesome battle, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\n still here!\u201d Uraraka\u2019s yell was heard through the stadium, immediately \nquieting the mayor. Everyone turned to stare at her, including Bakugou. \nHis cheeks flushed as he stared at the woman before him; she held her \nstaff against her chest, her brown eyes glaring with determination. \u201cAnd\n I won\u2019t need to <i>kill</i> the dragon to defeat him! Clear a path!\u201d \nshe demanded, watching people on the benches in front of her slowly move\n to the side as she walked forward.</p><p>Her aura was insanely \npowerful, the gravity of it hitting Bakugou in the chest. Silently he \nwondered if she even needed him, with the level of intensity in her \neyes, she could probably get Kirishima to listen on his own.</p><p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d she said, turning around, her hair swinging across her face. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He\n bit his lip, his teeth trembling. She didn\u2019t need to order him the fuck\n around, but he wasn\u2019t about to argue. Not right now. He stood up and \nfollowed her, walking down past the crowd, keeping his gaze down.</p><p>\u201cNot\n going to kill him?\u201d The mayor began to laugh loudly, the crowd quickly \njoining in, but Uraraka\u2019s resolve did not sway. Bakugou watched her gait\n fill with more confidence as they laughed at her.</p><p>She was more than human.</p><p>She was a strong, powerful mage, and nothing was going to stop her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\n right!\u201d she yelled over the laughter. \u201cWhile all of you are hoping to \nhurt this creature,\u201d she said, tapping each foot with her staff. She \ngently floated down into the arena, her feet landing on the dirt. \u201cI\u2019m \ngoing to show there\u2019s no need for that. I\u2026 am dragon tamer and I\u2019m \ngoing to prove it right now.\u201d</p><p>Following after Uraraka, Bakugou hopped down into the dirt, standing directly next to her.</p><p>\u201cOh? And how do you plan to prove that!?\u201d The mayor roared with laughter yet again.</p><p>\u201cWith my dragon right here,\u201d she said, gesturing to Bakugou.</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d Bakugou hissed, narrowing his red eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 deal with it!\u201d she grumbled under her breath.</p><p>The crowd began to murmur, confusion spreading across the large group of people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear, but I think you are sorely mistaken! For that is not a dragon,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s a person!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n really?\u201d she smirked and Bakugou immediately lowered his hood. His \ngolden scales shone in the sunlight, his elongated pointed ears \nglistening against the rays of the morning beams. More murmurs spread \nthrough the crowd, especially from those close to the front who could \nactually see.</p><p>As soon as the hood came off, Kirishima let out a \nroar, raising his feet up to stomp them to the ground. The chains \nrattled against his wings, and Bakugou met his eyes. He nodded once, \nhoping his idiot friend wasn\u2019t actually worried about him; he could tell\n Kirishima wanted him to leave.</p><p>Uraraka turned to Bakugou. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d she whispered, stepping forward to place her hand on his chest.</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 Guess I fucking have to be,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>She\n let her fingers fan out over his heart, pretending as if she was the \none to control his transformation. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d she whispered, her \nbrown eyes filled with concern.</p><p>\u201cQuit worrying, Cheeks. We got this.\u201d </p><p>His\n chest felt warm, a gentle hum trickling under his skin. He stared at \nher for a moment. Was she transferring magic to him? It was faint, but \nhe could feel her magical current pulsing towards his heart. He blushed,\n and wrapped his fingers around her wrist. \u201cStand back\u2026\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Stepping\n away from her, he released his tight hold on his magic, his body \ntrembling with the release. His chest lurched forward, wings immediately\n sprouting from his back. He cried out, the bones and muscles under his \nskin cracking as he fell to the ground, pressing his palms flat against \nthe earth. Claws curled out from his fingertips, scraping against the \nground. He roared again, his jaw elongating and pushing forward.</p><p>He\n was used to the transformation by now. After almost 19 years, he would \nhave to be. It hurt, but Bakugou was mostly numb to the pain. He was \nused to his spine stretching as his golden tail sprouted behind him. He \nwas used to his arms and legs, changing his body and growing rapidly.</p><p>He stood, the transformation complete, and he stared at Kirishima.</p><p><i>\u2018Idiot. What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing getting yourself captured?!\u2019</i>\n he hissed, sending the mental thoughts to Kirishima. Smoke huffed from \nthe tip of his nose and all around him, and he became acutely aware of \nthe audience\u2019s screams.</p><p><i>'Bakugou! What are YOU doing here?!\u2019</i> he said, his voice panicked.</p><p>A\n rush of relief washed over Bakugou, happy Kirishima could understand \nhis spoken thoughts. He hadn\u2019t lost himself completely to the beast.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Fucking hell. I came for you. We have to go back.\u2019</i>\n</p><p>Kirishima fluttered his wings pathetically. <i>'I-I can\u2019t!\u2019</i> he stammered. <i>'I can\u2019t change back!\u2019</i></p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'I had a feeling\u2026\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Uraraka began, and Bakguou\u2019s gaze snapped down \nto her. Right. He was supposed to be fucking listening to her or \nwhatever\u2026 \u201cThis is my dragon, and he obeys my commands.\u201d</p><p>Obeys?! She was really fucking milking this for all it was worth, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>He huffed again, smoke puffing out of his nostrils.</p><p><i>'Who is this girl? What are you doing? Are you really under her control!?\u2019</i> Kirishima asked, rushing through a list of questions.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Of course not dumb ass! She\u2019s helping me rescue your stupid face! If you listen to her, we can probably get you out!\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'So you want me to play along?\u2019</i>\n</p><p><i>'Yeah just\u2026 fucking listen to her for now.\u2019</i> Bakugou nodded, leaning his head down to her.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re being so submissive!\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Shut the fuck up!\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cHow can you prove that he won\u2019t attack you?\u201d the mayor called out and Bakugou turned his head, huffing out a breath of smoke.</p><p>\u201cClearly,\n he\u2019s not attacking me or anyone right now!\u201d she laughed and gently \npressed her hand up against his snout. With a grunt, he nuzzled her.</p><p>\u201cCan\n you control when he attacks?\u201d There was something about the mayor\u2019s \nvoice; it trembled with a deep fear, and that made Bakugou smirk with \npride.</p><p>\u201cYes. Bakugou\u2026 fire!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>The hell!? She\n wanted him to use that much magic!? He let out a growl and stood up, \nshooting flames into the arena. They fell against the dirt and flickered\n before Bakugou stepped on them with his large foot to put it out. The \nlast thing he needed was them thinking they were hostile.</p><p>\u201cYou \nare\u2026 quite powerful\u2026 young lady,\u201d the mayor said, and Bakugou turned\n to face him. A dark look came over his eyes. Something wasn\u2019t right. \nBakugou could tell this man wasn\u2019t going to listen to Uraraka in the way\n she hoped. He immediately stepped in front of her, hoping to stop any \nattacks that came her way. \u201cELEMENTAL GUARDS!\u201d the mayor yelled, \npointing directly at Bakugou.</p><p>Uraraka gasped, clutching her staff \nto her chest and she turned her head just in time to hear more members \nof the audience scream as Todoroki held his hand out, making an ice \nslide down to the arena.</p><p>\u201cT-Todoroki!\u201d she yelled, now standing next to him as he landed in the arena next to her.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 we can\u2019t leave Kirishima!\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\n was quick to spread his wings, puffing out smoke as he spat a ring of \nfire around them, blockading them from the charging guards.</p><p>\u201cIf \nthey have water elementals, this isn\u2019t going to last very long,\u201d \nTodoroki murmured, rushing towards Kirishima. \u201cWe might be able to cut \nthrough the chains with my ice. Do you have any offensive spells?\u201d he \nasked.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d she muttered. \u201cOnly healing magic!\u201d she gasped, shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try ice. If we can at least break the ones on his wings we can get him out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she said. \u201cThe arena is covered!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d he muttered, glancing around. \u201cLet\u2019s at least get the chains off and then we can try and find an escape route.\u201d</p><p>As\n the two approached, Kirishima bucked backwards, tossing his legs into \nthe air and shaking his head, the chains rattling against his back.</p><p><i>'They\u2019re gonna fucking help you, moron!\u2019</i>\n Bakugou huffed. He turned his head towards the sky. He could possibly \nbreak the structure if he slammed his back against the large metal beams\n covering the surface.</p><p>Pressing his feet close to the ground, he \nlaunched himself into the air, the wind from his wings pushing the fire \nout and causing the guards to fall backwards. Idiots. Did they really \nthink they could beat his fire?</p><p>\u201cWAVE!\u201d One of the guards called out, a giant rush of water pushing towards the flames.</p><p>Fucking shitty humans and their shitty magic!</p><p>Bakugou\n pushed his back against the metal, crying out loudly when he hit \nagainst the bars. It hurt, but it certainly made a dent. If they could \nget the chains off of Kirishima\u2019s wings, the two of them could probably \ndo it together.</p><p>As they ran close to Kirishima, Uraraka held her \nstaff out. \u201cI\u2019ll get us higher!\u201d she breathed. She never used her \ngravity magic on two people before, but desperate times called for \ndesperate measures.</p><p>\u201cFLOAT!\u201d she cried out, tapping both of \nTodoroki\u2019s feet. He began to rise, his hair floating upwards. \u201cF-FLOAT!\u201d\n she called out once more, tapping her own two feet. She reached for \nTodoroki\u2019s hand, pushing herself off of the ground, she flung them up \nwith momentum, the two of them landing on Kirishima\u2019s wing.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Uraraka?\u201d Todoroki asked, looking at her with concern.</p><p>\u201cF-Fine,\u201d she gasped, kneeling on Kirishima\u2019s wing.</p><p>He\n nodded, knowing they didn\u2019t stand a chance if they kept wasting time. \n\u201cFreeze!\u201d he cried out and ice wrapped around Kirishima\u2019s wing, the cold\n substance covering his red, scaly skin.</p><p>\u201cWAVE!\u201d More guards were \narriving, waves of water covering the flames Bakugou kept attempting to \nreplenish. Uraraka glanced up, watching Bakugou push against the metal \nbeams. He looked exhausted, and she was worried he was using too much of\n his magic. Either way, she supposed him overworking himself a little \nwas better than them all dying.</p><p>The red dragon cried out and began\n to flap his wing, the ice starting to crack against the metal, the \nchains about the snap. Todoroki leaped forward, landing directly on \nKirishima\u2019s back. He held his hand out, casting the spell to wrap the \nice around his other wing.</p><p>The dragon rolled his back, shaking out as his entire body shivered, bucking underneath the smaller humans.</p><p>\u201cFREEZE!\u201d Guards called out, shooting ice in the direction of Kirishima.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Uraraka cried, gesturing towards the ice headed directly towards them.</p><p>He\n whipped his body around, holding his other hand out as he felt the \nchains heat up against his hand. \u201cFIRE!\u201d he yelled, shooting flames from\n the jewels against his palm, the flames melting the ice it immediately \ncame into contact with.</p><p>\u201cUraraka!\u201d Todoroki cried out, holding his other hand out to her. \u201cWe have to hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cR-Right,\u201d\n she cried out, jumping forward to take his hand. She clung to him hard \nas Kirishima\u2019s wings spread, breaking the frozen ice.</p><p>Todoroki lunged forward, grabbing at one of the chains around his neck as he clung to Uraraka hard. \u201cHold on,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she gasped as Kirishima pushed into the air.</p><p>The\n two dragons nodded to each other, slamming their backs against the \nmetal bars. Bakugou huffed, shooting flames down at the guards in front \nof him. The dragon\u2019s fire was far more overpowering than Todoroki\u2019s, and\n any ice that shot their way was far too small and not high enough to \nreach them.</p><p>With another slam, the bars bent upwards, leaving enough space for them to escape, dashing into the air.</p><p>Uraraka\n clung to Todoroki, the wind whipping against her cheeks as she slammed \nher eyes shut, hoping they would land somewhere far, far away from any \nother villages or towns.</p><p>~~</p><p>It took about an hour of flying \nto get anywhere away from civilization. They flew over towns and \nvillages and Ochako was certain rumors would be flying now.</p><p>As \nthey made their way towards the mountains, Bakugou nodded his head \ntowards a large cave on the side, flying down towards it, landing \nagainst the large ledge.</p><p>Kirishima followed closely behind and \nwhen he pressed his feet to the ground, he bowed his head down, allowing\n Ochako and Todoroki to slip down to the ground.</p><p>Her brown hair \nfluttered about her face and Todoroki\u2019s looked as it had been slicked \nback, the force of the wind was so strong high in the sky.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe we made it\u2026\u201d Ochako whispered, her hands trembling against her staff.</p><p>\u201cSame\u2026\u201d\n Todoroki muttered and quickly turned around towards Kirishima. \u201cI could\n probably freeze the muzzle off in the same way if you don\u2019t mind your \nmouth being cold.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima\u2019s ears perked up and he leaned down, \ncrouching close the ground. Holding his palm out, Todoroki breathed the \nword out and ice curled around Kirishima\u2019s snout, freezing the chains. \n\u201cGive it a moment and you should be able to break them with your jaw.\u201d</p><p>Ochako turned towards Bakugou, wondering if he would be able to change back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, stepping towards him.</p><p>He growled, turning his head away from her for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf you can\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>He\n let out another growl, his body lurching forward as he began to shrink \nback to his human form. Immediately, he fell to his knees, his chest \nheaving, coughs slipping between his lips.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou!\u201d she \ngasped, running to him. Scales littered his face once again, his long \nears twitching as he tried to catch his breath. \u201cYou\u2019re in pain,\u201d she \nsaid softly.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m fucking fine!\u201d he snapped, his body \nalmost completely back to normal minus the scales on his face, his ears \nand his dragon wings. \u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d she begged. \u201cPlease let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\n can\u2019t!\u201d he hissed, feebly attempting to pull away from her. \u201cYou can\u2019t \nfucking give me magic, so what the hell do you plan on doing!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I heal you, you can pull your wings back\u2026 at the very least.\u201d</p><p>His\n wings fluttered behind him, his face wincing. They looked heavy against\n his body, and his panting grew heavier. \u201cFuck. Do\u2026 whatever you want.\n It\u2019s not going to work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-It might,\u201d she whispered, pressing \nher hand to his chest. Her hand felt heated, the small hum of magic \nreturning under her palm. She pressed her staff over his heart, and shut\n her eyes. \u201cCure,\u201d she whispered, her palm feeling hot.</p><p>\u201cNgh\u2026\u201d \nhe grunted, his head dropping back. He winced, his back arching as his \nwings slowly began to fold back towards his body. The large bruises on \nhis back slowly disappeared, and the searing pain in his chest, back, \nand neck dissipated as well.</p><p>This woman\u2026 had far more magical \nability than she let on. How could such a small body hold so much power?\n He didn\u2019t underestimate her, never had, and definitely never would. \nWatching her walk into the arena with such confidence earlier was hard \nto ignore\u2026 and even now, watching her be so certain about what her \npower could do. It was something she never tried, and yet she was so \nconfident she could help his transformation.</p><p>And she was right apparently.</p><p>Ochako\n swallowed, her brown eyes turning up towards him. \u201cT-There\u2026\u201d she \nwhispered. Her hand pressed against his chest as she tried to push back.\n Her arm trembled and her breathing grew heavy. \u201cI\u2019m glad you could\u2026 \ns-shift just\u2026 a little more\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi! What did you do?\u201d Bakugou growled.</p><p>\u201cI-I healed you\u2026\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\n used too much magic, didn\u2019t you!?\u201d Snapping at her, he shook her \nshoulders in an attempt to keep her awake. But her eyes fluttered shut, \nand her head rolled forward. \u201cUraraka!\u201d Bakugou yelled as she slumped \nagainst him, completely passed out.</p><p>\u201cOi! Half and Half!\u201d Bakugou yelled. \u201cSomethin\u2019s wrong with Cheeks!\u201d</p><p>Todoroki\n glanced away from Kirishima, closing his palm. The ice was settling \naround the muzzle and he nodded, letting the dragon wait. He pushed up, \nwalking over to Bakugou, his eyes widening when he saw her face pressed \nagainst Bakugou\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking know!\u201d Bakugou yelled. \u201cShe started healing me to help me shift back and then she fuckin\u2019 just\u2026 passed out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe overused her magic,\u201d Todoroki muttered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how the hell that\u2019s even possible, since you idiots don\u2019t use magic through your fucking bodies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\n not exactly. The source of magic doesn\u2019t come from our bodies, no, but \nthe magical current flows through us when we activate the items we use. \nSo technically it does use her energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026I did feel an odd hum \nagainst her hand when she used her goddamn magic. I told her she didn\u2019t \nhave to!\u201d he growled, holding her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2026 A weird hum?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, when she had her hand on my chest,\u201d Bakugou snapped, his gaze fixated on the girl in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\n Todoroki tapped his chin, looking at the two of them. It was odd\u2026 \nsomething like that shouldn\u2019t have come from her hand, but her staff \nrather. \u201cI\u2019ll get a fire started,\u201d he said, backing away. \u201cLet her rest,\n her energy will replenish and she will wake up.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah\u2026\u201d Bakugou muttered, his hand touching her brown hair.</p><p>He\n cared about her far more than he let on. Even after the fire started, \nit took Bakugou a moment to lay her down, covering her with his cloak.</p><p>\u201cWatch her,\u201d he demanded, pointing to Todoroki.</p><p>\u201cI will, you have nothing to worry about. She just needs sleep,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2026\u201d he grumbled, heading away from the fire and out onto the ledge. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Kirishima.\u201d</p><p>With\n the muzzle having been frozen off, Kirishima only had a chain around \nhis neck, his body able to move as freely as possible. He turned his \nhead towards the two humans, and glanced back at Bakugou who was \ntraipsing towards the edge of the cave. He plopped down on the edge, \ndangling his legs over the side.</p><p>Kirishima followed, laying down next to him, curling his tail to the side.</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave,\u201d Bakugou said.</p><p><i>'So fast? You\u2019re going to miss that human girl!\u2019</i> Kirishima\u2019s tone was taunting, and his head moved up and down with his laughter.</p><p>\u201cShut it!\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fucking miss her. We have bigger problems. You can\u2019t change back can you?\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'No\u2026 I thought if I was away from that village I might be able to when things calmed down but\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cFucking\u2026 dammit!\u201d he hissed, slamming his fist against the \nstone ground. \u201cHumans\u2026 aren\u2019t stealing our magic. They can\u2019t even use \nit on their own.\u201d</p><p><i>'What!?\u2019</i> Kirishima lifted his head, glancing back at the two human mages inside the cave.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\n They need a fucking\u2026 I dunno\u2026 magical object or some bullshit!\u201d He \ngestured back towards them. \u201cThat\u2019s why Half and Half has those weird \nhand things and Cheeks has the staff,\u201d he said.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'How\u2026 did you meet them exactly?\u2019</i>\n</p><p>Bakugou rubbed his forehead. \u201cLook my magic isn\u2019t doing great \neither and I got captured in a village\u2026 but Cheeks has some kind of \ndragon fetish so she rescued me. It got her banished from her town and \nwe went to the city to find Half and Half, another dragon fanatic. He \nheard rumors of you and I came to fucking get you. The end. Now we have \nto go home, we don\u2019t have time to dick around here worrying about \nhumans.\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Wait\u2026 you got her banished from her town and you\u2019re just\u2026 gonna ditch her!? She saved you, dude!\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell else am I supposed to do?\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m done \nhanging out with humans and we\u2019re not any closer to solving this damn \nproblem!\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'Take them with us.\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cTo the island!? Yeah right,\u201d Bakugou huffed. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m\n doing that. We\u2019ll wait for her to wake up and then we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'You\u2019re really okay with just leaving her behind?\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cYeah. I already fuckin\u2019 told you. I\u2019m done here.\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>'You\u2019re an idiot. As always.\u2019</i>\n</p><p>\u201cShut it, Red Scales!\u201d</p><p>For a moment he glanced behind \nhimself, seeing her small form lying on the ground. He couldn\u2019t take her\n with him\u2026 not anymore. He\u2019d let her tag along for far too long, and \nhe was finished.</p><p>~~</p><p>Ochako\u2019s body ached and her eyes \nfluttered open. Pressed against her nose was Bakugou\u2019s cloak, the fur \ntickling her skin. It smelled nice though, sweet comforting. Over the \npast week, she had grown used to his smell, and took an odd amount of \ncomfort in it.</p><p>She pushed herself up, noting the fire seemed to be dimming, the flames flickering out.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 Cheeks. Took you long enough to wake up,\u201d Bakugou snorted, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou!\u201d she gasped, turning around to face him. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\n of yesterday afternoon and night\u2026 It\u2019s morning now,\u201d Todoroki said \nstretching up. \u201cYou need to be more careful about how you use your \nmagic.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked down towards her staff. \u201cI know. I just\u2026 wanted to help.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki sighed. \u201cYou won\u2019t do much help if you drain yourself dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHAH!? You could\u2019ve DIED!?\u201d Bakugou yelled, standing up.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 technically\u2026\u201d she chuckled awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019\n hell, Uraraka. What the fuck are you thinking?!\u201d He ran his hand \nthrough his spiky blond locks, his face twitching with anger.</p><p>She frowned, turning to stand up, glaring at the golden dragon. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to suffer! You were in pain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n would\u2019ve been fuckin\u2019 fine. Nothing to kill yourself over!\u201d he snapped.\n \u201cFuck. You\u2019re so fucking reckless, it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re leaving soon\n so you can go be normal somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She froze, her eyebrow furrowing. \u201cLeaving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\n Kirishima and I are going back to our island. We\u2019re not sticking \naround\u2026 here!\u201d he said, gesturing to the cave. \u201cWe got shit we gotta \nfigure out.\u201d</p><p>Ochako glanced down at Todoroki. \u201cBut what about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out together I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Todoroki frowned, pushing himself. \u201cSo you\u2019re just going to leave us here in this cave? Far from any human civilization?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave and we\u2019ve shown our goddamn dragon forms to enough people!\u201d Bakugou hissed.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s a few more?!\u201d Todoroki snapped back. \u201cWe just helped you. Uraraka has given up her life to keep you safe and <i>this</i> is how you\u2019re going to treat her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTodoroki\u2026\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Kirishima let out a whine, thumping his tail against the ground. He turned towards both mages, a sad look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 What are we supposed to do?\u201d Ochako said.</p><p>\u201cYou can go back to your normal boring human life,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t go home! I\u2019m not allowed, remember?!\u201d</p><p>Bakugou rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not my fucking problem. That was your goddamn choice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all could\u2019ve died trying to rescue your friend,\u201d Todoroki stated bluntly.</p><p>\u201cAgain, you didn\u2019t have to fucking help me!\u201d he snorted.</p><p>\u201cSo you could\u2019ve handled that on your own?\u201d Ochako asked. \u201cExcuse me for caring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to care!\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cAnd\n what do you plan on doing when you get back to your island? You\u2019re \ngoing to have to change forms to get there! Will you be able to fully \ntransform back?\u201d she scoffed. \u201cThe only way you were able to get back to\n normal was by using my magic!\u201d</p><p>Bakugou froze, glaring at the girl. Did she really think he <i>needed</i> her? Yes, she helped him far more than he wanted her to. And he couldn\u2019t deny it was her magic that helped him\u2026 but\u2026</p><p>\u201cAre you really just okay with leaving us behind?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Kirishima snorted, huffing as he swung his body around, sitting next to Todoroki and Uraraka.</p><p>\u201cIs\n this you trying to tell me you\u2019re on their side? You want me to bring \nthem back with us? You really think we can just bring two fuckin\u2019 <i>humans</i>\n back with us!?\u201d Bakugou growled, his long ears twitching against his \nhead. \u201cFucking hell\u2026\u201d He ran his hand through his blond hair again. \n\u201cNo way. We\u2019re not bringing them.\u201d</p><p>His gaze fell upon Uraraka, her\n eyes filled to the brim with emotion. Her pupils trembled and he \ncouldn\u2019t tell if she was angry or sad.</p><p>\u201cF-Fine!\u201d she hissed, \nstorming past him before he could speak again. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t even want \nto go with you!\u201d Her eyes narrowed, glaring at him as she headed towards\n the edge of the cave.</p><p>\u201cUraraka-\u201d Todoroki called out, raising his\n hand up after her, but Bakugou was quick to cut him off, realizing what\n he needed to do.</p><p>\u201cShut it Half and Half! I\u2019ll go talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t\n seem like she wants to talk to you,\u201d Todoroki stated, pointing at her \nas she continued towards the entrance of the cave.</p><p>\u201cSHUT IT!\u201d he yelled, and immediately charged after her. \u201cOi! Cheeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone Bakugou!\u201d she snapped. \u201cIsn\u2019t this what you want?! You\u2019ve been trying to get rid of me this entire time!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm and tried to stop her but she immediately yanked it away. \u201cUraraka,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI-I don\u2019t need you! I don\u2019t even want to stay with you!\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. What a fucking liar she was.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2026 you can come with us,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh\n gee, thanks! How kind of you to allow it! Don\u2019t do me any favors, \nBakugou. I\u2019m finally taking the hint!\u201d she yelled, tears streaming down \nher cheeks.</p><p>As brave and as tough as she was, he knew she really \nhad nowhere to go. Even if she went back with Todoroki, it most likely \nwouldn\u2019t feel like home to her. And though she technically chose to \nrescue him, it was still his fault she wasn\u2019t allowed to go home.</p><p>\u201cOi\u2026\u201d\n he mumbled, hating how her face looked as she cried. The last thing he \nwanted to do was make her fuckin\u2019 cry. \u201cI\u2026 I want you to come\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d she sniffed, wiping her eye on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come with us,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re just saying that!\u201d she yelled. Her round cheeks were blotchy and red from crying, her lip trembling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\n not! I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t ask you to care but you do. If it wasn\u2019t for \nyour stupid round cheeks, I\u2019d be fucking dead and so would Kirishima,\u201d \nhe growled. \u201cIt\u2026 would be weird to be without you\u2026\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cY-You\n would be!\u201d she scoffed, folding her arms over her chest. Why did she \nlook so cute when she was being such an indignant little shit?</p><p>\u201cOi! Don\u2019t push it!\u201d he growled. \u201cJust\u2026 fucking come okay? It\u2019ll be easier this way.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Sniffing once more, she wiped her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cG-Good\u2026\u201d\n he muttered, his cheeks turning a gentle shade of red, even over his \ngolden scales. \u201cJ-Just\u2026 will you quit crying now?\u201d he snapped. \u201cIt \ndoesn\u2019t look good on your face\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her pink cheeks grew even pinker, and she smiled. \u201cSorry, Bakugou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi,\n what the hell! Don\u2019t apologize! Just don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t do it anymore!\u201d he \nscoffed, gently pushing on her forehead with his finger.</p><p>Her lips curled up into a smirk. \u201cAdmit it\u2026 if you left me behind, you probably would\u2019ve missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cheeks. S'got nothing to do with that.\u201d Immediately, he turned away from her.</p><p>\u201cI bet you would!\u201d she giggled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it!\u201d he clenched his fists, looking at her cute smile.</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d she teased, leaning towards him. \u201cNot until you admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll make you shut up!\u201d he snapped, grabbing her cheeks and pulling their lips together.</p><p>She\n froze, a muffled \u201cMmph!\u201d slipping from her lips, but after taking a \nmoment to process, she kissed him back. Her mouth pressed against his, \nher hand curling into a fist against his chest. He nipped at her lower, \nfinally giving her a proper kiss after the horrible lip smash she didn\u2019t\n remember.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you just kissed me\u2026\u201d she whispered\n when he finally pulled back. Her cheeks were flushed, her gaze flicking\n between his eyes and his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou did it first,\u201d he shrugged, brushing his thumb over her cheek bone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! No I didn\u2019t!\u201d she said, furrowing her brow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he smirked. \u201cGuess you don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh!?!\u201d she gasped, stepping away from him, cupping her hands over her cheeks. \u201cW-When I woke up next to you in the inn\u2026!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bakugou nodded, letting her figure it out.</p><p>\u201cI-I kissed you?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you loved me,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>Her eyes widened, looking as if they were about to pop out of her head. \u201cW-W-WHAT!?!?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm. You said dragons were so cool,\u201d he teased .</p><p>\u201c\u2026I-I\n meant dragons! O-Obviously! I love DRAGONS! Not you specifically, but \nmore\u2026 by, uh, proxy? Since you\u2019re a dragon and all\u2026!\u201d she said, \nshaking her head back and forth rapidly.</p><p>\u201cSure Round Face,\u201d he grinned. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I bet I didn\u2019t even kiss you and you\u2019re just\u2026 you\u2019re just making it up!\u201d she snorted.</p><p>\u201cNope. Definitely happened. Does it really matter? We just kissed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2026. it matters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\n he snorted, trying to play it as casual as possible. Inside, his heart \nwas throbbing against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fuckin\u2019 kiss. Look,\u201d he \ngrunted and leaned forward and brushed there lips together. \u201cWe just did\n again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEH!?\u201d she squeaked, her cheeks still bright red. \u201cIt\u2026 it would\u2019ve been my first! Or this one was!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\n guess I got your first kiss then,\u201d he said, shrugging. She stared at \nhis lips again and blushed, backing away. \u201cLet\u2019s get going. We can\u2019t \nstay in this fucking cave all day.\u201d He turned away from her, unable to \nlook at how cute her blushing face was.</p><p>\u201cH-Hey! You can\u2019t just walk away after kissing me!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will,\u201d he smirked. \u201cWe gotta get going. I don\u2019t want to be stuck in this cave forever.\u201d</p><p>He\n continued back towards Kirishima and Todoroki, both looking confused at\n what transpired between the two of them. From deep in the cave, they \nhadn\u2019t seen what happened between the two.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Bakugou said. \u201cGet ready to hold on tight, cause Kirishima is going to fly us back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us?\u201d Todoroki asked, tilting his head.</p><p>\u201cJust shut the fuck up and do it.</p><p>Kirishima stomped his foot on the ground, narrowing his eyes at Bakugou.</p><p>\"Oh shut up, you know I can\u2019t change. I might not be able to change back if I do!\u201d he scoffed, folding his arms.</p><p>\u201cBakugou!\u201d Uraraka yelled, her voice echoing into the depths of the cave.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\n leaving Cheeks,\u201d he said, grabbing one of the chains around Kirishima\u2019s\n neck as he swung himself onto his back. Todoroki followed his move, \nclimbing onto the red dragon\u2019s back. \u201cYou comin\u2019?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she tapped the bottoms of her feet with her staff. She supposed they would talk about the kiss\u2026 or <i>kisses</i> later.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>",

Now an adult and professional mage, \nshe&rsquo;s ready to help her parents as a healer for their village. The last \nthing she expects is for her beliefs to become a reality, but when a \ndragon attacks her village, she learns there&rsquo;s more to magic than she \never could&rsquo;ve realized.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16804609/chapters/41365580\">Read on AO3</a><br /><br />Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z3xF4a7jao2Xy-1acpZzw\">@its-love-u-asshole</a> for reading this over. <br /></small></p><p><small>With a huff, Bakugou followed Uraraka and Todoroki to a large covered\n arena the townsfolk prepared for the dragon battle. Apparently this \ntown enjoyed tournaments and sports, and many people spent their time \ngambling here&hellip; it was possibly the worst place Kirishima could&rsquo;ve \nended up.</small></p><p><small>He wrinkled his nose when they stepped into the arena, \nthe loud cheers and murmurings of humans hurting his ears. Deplorable \nfucking creatures. How the hell did they think it was okay to hurt an \nendangered creature. Did humans find something rare and immediately want\n to be rid of it?</small></p><p><small>He glanced at Uraraka, gesturing to Todoroki \nabout something, he couldn&rsquo;t hear her over the large roaring of the \ncrowd. He supposed not all humans were bad, and perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t fair \nfor him to make an assumption. Or maybe&hellip; it was just that he didn&rsquo;t \nhate <i>her</i>.</small></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go sign us up,&rdquo; Uraraka said, gesturing to a long line of men waiting by the entrance. &ldquo;Get us a seat?&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou\n nodded, following after Todoroki. The crowd was already rowdy, cheering\n over loud music. Many of them were drinking already, looking jovial and\n ready to celebrate whoever their champion would be.</p><p>The arena was\n dome shaped and covered with large bars, and Bakugou wondered if he and\n Kirishima could break them if they were both in dragon form. He \nsupposed they needed to have some way to keep Kirishima fucking \ncontained.</p><p>He growled, looking at the ceiling. Hopefully Kirishima\n hadn&rsquo;t lost his fucking mind. If he only had the mind of a dragon, it \nwould make it next to impossible to communicate with him, even if they \nwere both in dragon form.</p><p>&ldquo;How is here, Bakugou?&rdquo; Todoroki asked, \nand he stared at the spot. He didn&rsquo;t give a shit where they sat, so \ninstead of responding, he plopped his ass down, folding his arms. He \nadjusted the hood on his cloak, making sure it stayed up. The last thing\n he needed was to reveal his shit to the people around them.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi&hellip; Half and Half&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered, folding his arms. &ldquo;Do you think this is going to work?&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki\n blinked, as if he was surprised Bakugou was asking him such a serious \nquestion. He frowned, turning towards the center of the arena. &ldquo;If you \nlisten to Uraraka, I think it&rsquo;ll go well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled, keeping his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>He fucking hated the idea of having to listen to a goddamn human, but she was convinced this plan would work.</p><p>It\n also meant having to use his dragon form, something he was actively \ntrying to avoid doing. The last thing he needed was to get stuck too. If\n need be, he would force himself to shift back to human form, but it \nwould be unpleasant, and possible drain more magic from himself than \nneeded.</p><p>&ldquo;Bakugou?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah!?&rdquo; he growled, snapping from his \nthoughts as he turned to look up at Uraraka. Fuck she was pretty. Her \nhat covered part of her forehead, but her brown hair still brushed \nagainst her round cheeks, the sun a bright backdrop against her cute \nsmile.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; I asked if you could move over just a bit?&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Blinking, Bakugou shook his head, pulled from his damn thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; he growled, moving closer to Todoroki.</p><p>&ldquo;I\n signed us up,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;They made fun of me, saying they \ndidn&rsquo;t think a little girl like me could possibly take on the dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou frowned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fucking bullshit. I&rsquo;d like to see their pansy asses take on a dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; we&rsquo;re not first&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;So you will get the chance to watch. Hopefully no one else&hellip; is strong enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like hell they will be!&rdquo; Bakugou snorted and folded his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome\n everyone, to the first annual dragon slaying competition!&rdquo; A loud voice\n boomed from up on the top of the stands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the mayor of this fair \ntown, and today many of you have signed up to have the chance to take on\n the great red dragon we have captured. It took many of our ice, ground,\n and fire elemental guard to capture such a large creature and today&hellip; \nYou will have the chance to prove your strength against such a powerful \nbeing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; idiot,&rdquo; Bakugou growled.</p><p>Before the mayor \ncould continue speaking, there was a loud roar heard in the distance, \nthe entire stadium shaking. Bakugou clenched his fists by his side. It \nwas certainly Kirishima, he would&rsquo;ve recognized the deafening sound \nanywhere. Though he could tell the sound was painful&hellip; Kirishima&rsquo;s roar\n didn&rsquo;t have the normal spark Bakugou was used to.</p><p>&ldquo;There you have\n it! The creature approaches! We do hope you know that we have \nconstrained the dragon to the best of our ability, but we cannot be held\n responsible if it attacks or breaks free. Our guard does stand at the \nready,&rdquo; the man continued.</p><p>The ground shook, and Bakugou narrowed \nhis eyes, watching as the large gates to the arena opened. Men were \npulling on long chains, tugging the creature forward and when Kirishima \nfinally entered the arena, Bakugou stood up, his body trembling with \nanger.</p><p>His wings were chained back, unable to fly even if he \nwanted to. There was a large chain muzzle around his lips, his jaw \nunable to open much wider; no wonder his cry had been so muffled.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; A man behind Bakugou pushed his hand onto his shoulder and Bakugou whipped his head around, glaring.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell me what to fucking do, I&rsquo;ll bite your head off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;E-Eesh&hellip;&rdquo; The man blinked, slowly pulling his hand away.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bakugou maybe you should-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at what they&rsquo;re doing! Of course they&rsquo;re going to kill him!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna fucking kill them first!&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima\n let out another pained cry, tugging his head back on the chains. A few \nof the men on the ground fell backwards, but even with the movement, \nKirishima didn&rsquo;t have enough control over his wings. They were torturing\n him, and it was possible they were going to kill him.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bakugou&hellip; please!&rdquo;</p><p>Her\n fingers gently wrapped around his hand, giving him a gentle tug. As \nmuch as he wanted to charge out and rescue his friend, he knew it would \ndo him no good to be impatient. Slowly, he lowered himself back down, \ntrembling against the bench.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your time, Bakugou,&rdquo; Todoroki said calmly.</p><p>&ldquo;We fucking better!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I present to you&hellip; the RED DRAGON!&rdquo; The mayor called out and the entire audience erupted into a loud cheer.</p><p>Kirishima\n glanced around, smoke huffing from his nostrils as he clearly searched \nfor some way to escape. His wings fluttered, the chains rattling as he \ntried to spread them, finding himself immediately incapable of movement.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s\n not gonna have a fucking chance&hellip;&rdquo; Bakugou hissed, his fingers curling\n against his pants. How the fuck was he supposed to do anything if he \nwas completely chained up? He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use his fire, nor \nwould he be able to fly&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;First up, we have our strongest \nbarbarian! A man from the city! To prove how strong this dragon is&hellip; \nlet&rsquo;s see how well he fares!&rdquo; The mayor&rsquo;s voice was loud and nasally, \ndisgusting to listen to, and Bakugou wondered if all human leaders were \nthis deplorable.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he muttered, watching the man step into \nthe arena with a giant battle axe. His muscles were huge, pulsing as he \nheld the large weapon in his hand.</p><p>Kirishima&rsquo;s pathetic cry was \nheard throughout the arena and surely farther than that&hellip; even with his\n mouth chained, the sound was booming.</p><p>The man swung his axe and \nKirishima leaped back, his legs collapsing to the ground. The man&rsquo;s axe \nhit his leg and Kirishima stumbled backwards, bright red blood seeping \nfrom the thick gash in his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Bakugou cursed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go now&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&hellip; not yet!&rdquo; Uraraka hissed.</p><p>Fucking bullshit, they couldn&rsquo;t-</p><p>With\n another loud roar, the man raised his axe, and Kirishima stomped with \nhis other foot on the ground, causing the man to stumble backwards. It \nwasn&rsquo;t enough to throw him completely off balance as he charged forward \nagain.</p><p>Kirishima tried to jump back and swing his tail towards the\n man, but the barbarian clipped the edge with his axe. Kirishima&rsquo;s head \nswung back, his mouth opening slightly while he yelped in pain.</p><p>All around the audience cheered, hollering with joyous laughter for the awful barbarian man.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I\n can&rsquo;t watch this,&rdquo; Uraraka breathed, covering her eyes. He couldn&rsquo;t \nexactly blame her. Nothing about the fight was fucking fair. Then again,\n if Kirishima was unchained, this man would be dead in a moment.</p><p>The\n man let out a hearty laugh. He lifted his axe once more, charging \nforward as he leaped up. This time, however, Kirishima lowered his head,\n swinging it to the side. He knocked the man straight against the wall. \nHe more than likely would&rsquo;ve been fine, if he hadn&rsquo;t been holding the \naxe behind him, it pressed into his back, shooting straight through his \nstomach and chest. Blood spurted from his mouth and his limbs, and he \nimmediately slouched over as he dangled against the wall.</p><p>All around the audience booed and hissed, gasping at such a ghastly sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Good fucking riddance,&rdquo; Bakugou snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;O-Oh&hellip;\n the man has come to an unsightly end!&rdquo; the mayor called sadly. &ldquo;But&hellip; \nyou came here to witness fights, and fights you will get. The red beast \nhas been injured, but as you can see, he won&rsquo;t be giving up anytime \nsoon. Up next we have someone else from out of town, a young mage <i>girl</i>, if she&rsquo;s still here. After that gruesome battle, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\n still here!&rdquo; Uraraka&rsquo;s yell was heard through the stadium, immediately \nquieting the mayor. Everyone turned to stare at her, including Bakugou. \nHis cheeks flushed as he stared at the woman before him; she held her \nstaff against her chest, her brown eyes glaring with determination. &ldquo;And\n I won&rsquo;t need to <i>kill</i> the dragon to defeat him! Clear a path!&rdquo; \nshe demanded, watching people on the benches in front of her slowly move\n to the side as she walked forward.</p><p>Her aura was insanely \npowerful, the gravity of it hitting Bakugou in the chest. Silently he \nwondered if she even needed him, with the level of intensity in her \neyes, she could probably get Kirishima to listen on his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Bakugou,&rdquo; she said, turning around, her hair swinging across her face. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>He\n bit his lip, his teeth trembling. She didn&rsquo;t need to order him the fuck\n around, but he wasn&rsquo;t about to argue. Not right now. He stood up and \nfollowed her, walking down past the crowd, keeping his gaze down.</p><p>&ldquo;Not\n going to kill him?&rdquo; The mayor began to laugh loudly, the crowd quickly \njoining in, but Uraraka&rsquo;s resolve did not sway. Bakugou watched her gait\n fill with more confidence as they laughed at her.</p><p>She was more than human.</p><p>She was a strong, powerful mage, and nothing was going to stop her.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\n right!&rdquo; she yelled over the laughter. &ldquo;While all of you are hoping to \nhurt this creature,&rdquo; she said, tapping each foot with her staff. She \ngently floated down into the arena, her feet landing on the dirt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m \ngoing to show there&rsquo;s no need for that. I&hellip; am dragon tamer and I&rsquo;m \ngoing to prove it right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Following after Uraraka, Bakugou hopped down into the dirt, standing directly next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh? And how do you plan to prove that!?&rdquo; The mayor roared with laughter yet again.</p><p>&ldquo;With my dragon right here,&rdquo; she said, gesturing to Bakugou.</p><p>&ldquo;Yours?&rdquo; Bakugou hissed, narrowing his red eyes at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; deal with it!&rdquo; she grumbled under her breath.</p><p>The crowd began to murmur, confusion spreading across the large group of people.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry dear, but I think you are sorely mistaken! For that is not a dragon,&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a person!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n really?&rdquo; she smirked and Bakugou immediately lowered his hood. His \ngolden scales shone in the sunlight, his elongated pointed ears \nglistening against the rays of the morning beams. More murmurs spread \nthrough the crowd, especially from those close to the front who could \nactually see.</p><p>As soon as the hood came off, Kirishima let out a \nroar, raising his feet up to stomp them to the ground. The chains \nrattled against his wings, and Bakugou met his eyes. He nodded once, \nhoping his idiot friend wasn&rsquo;t actually worried about him; he could tell\n Kirishima wanted him to leave.</p><p>Uraraka turned to Bakugou. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; she whispered, stepping forward to place her hand on his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip; Guess I fucking have to be,&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>She\n let her fingers fan out over his heart, pretending as if she was the \none to control his transformation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered, her \nbrown eyes filled with concern.</p><p>&ldquo;Quit worrying, Cheeks. We got this.&rdquo; </p><p>His\n chest felt warm, a gentle hum trickling under his skin. He stared at \nher for a moment. Was she transferring magic to him? It was faint, but \nhe could feel her magical current pulsing towards his heart. He blushed,\n and wrapped his fingers around her wrist. &ldquo;Stand back&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>Stepping\n away from her, he released his tight hold on his magic, his body \ntrembling with the release. His chest lurched forward, wings immediately\n sprouting from his back. He cried out, the bones and muscles under his \nskin cracking as he fell to the ground, pressing his palms flat against \nthe earth. Claws curled out from his fingertips, scraping against the \nground. He roared again, his jaw elongating and pushing forward.</p><p>He\n was used to the transformation by now. After almost 19 years, he would \nhave to be. It hurt, but Bakugou was mostly numb to the pain. He was \nused to his spine stretching as his golden tail sprouted behind him. He \nwas used to his arms and legs, changing his body and growing rapidly.</p><p>He stood, the transformation complete, and he stared at Kirishima.</p><p><i>&lsquo;Idiot. What the hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing getting yourself captured?!&rsquo;</i>\n he hissed, sending the mental thoughts to Kirishima. Smoke huffed from \nthe tip of his nose and all around him, and he became acutely aware of \nthe audience&rsquo;s screams.</p><p><i>'Bakugou! What are YOU doing here?!&rsquo;</i> he said, his voice panicked.</p><p>A\n rush of relief washed over Bakugou, happy Kirishima could understand \nhis spoken thoughts. He hadn&rsquo;t lost himself completely to the beast.</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'Fucking hell. I came for you. We have to go back.&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>Kirishima fluttered his wings pathetically. <i>'I-I can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</i> he stammered. <i>'I can&rsquo;t change back!&rsquo;</i></p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'I had a feeling&hellip;&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;As you can see,&rdquo; Uraraka began, and Bakguou&rsquo;s gaze snapped down \nto her. Right. He was supposed to be fucking listening to her or \nwhatever&hellip; &ldquo;This is my dragon, and he obeys my commands.&rdquo;</p><p>Obeys?! She was really fucking milking this for all it was worth, wasn&rsquo;t she?</p><p>He huffed again, smoke puffing out of his nostrils.</p><p><i>'Who is this girl? What are you doing? Are you really under her control!?&rsquo;</i> Kirishima asked, rushing through a list of questions.</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'Of course not dumb ass! She&rsquo;s helping me rescue your stupid face! If you listen to her, we can probably get you out!&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'So you want me to play along?&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p><i>'Yeah just&hellip; fucking listen to her for now.&rsquo;</i> Bakugou nodded, leaning his head down to her.</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'I&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;re being so submissive!&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'Shut the fuck up!&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;How can you prove that he won&rsquo;t attack you?&rdquo; the mayor called out and Bakugou turned his head, huffing out a breath of smoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly,\n he&rsquo;s not attacking me or anyone right now!&rdquo; she laughed and gently \npressed her hand up against his snout. With a grunt, he nuzzled her.</p><p>&ldquo;Can\n you control when he attacks?&rdquo; There was something about the mayor&rsquo;s \nvoice; it trembled with a deep fear, and that made Bakugou smirk with \npride.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Bakugou&hellip; fire!&rdquo; she cried out.</p><p>The hell!? She\n wanted him to use that much magic!? He let out a growl and stood up, \nshooting flames into the arena. They fell against the dirt and flickered\n before Bakugou stepped on them with his large foot to put it out. The \nlast thing he needed was them thinking they were hostile.</p><p>&ldquo;You \nare&hellip; quite powerful&hellip; young lady,&rdquo; the mayor said, and Bakugou turned\n to face him. A dark look came over his eyes. Something wasn&rsquo;t right. \nBakugou could tell this man wasn&rsquo;t going to listen to Uraraka in the way\n she hoped. He immediately stepped in front of her, hoping to stop any \nattacks that came her way. &ldquo;ELEMENTAL GUARDS!&rdquo; the mayor yelled, \npointing directly at Bakugou.</p><p>Uraraka gasped, clutching her staff \nto her chest and she turned her head just in time to hear more members \nof the audience scream as Todoroki held his hand out, making an ice \nslide down to the arena.</p><p>&ldquo;T-Todoroki!&rdquo; she yelled, now standing next to him as he landed in the arena next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to get out of here. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; we can&rsquo;t leave Kirishima!&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou\n was quick to spread his wings, puffing out smoke as he spat a ring of \nfire around them, blockading them from the charging guards.</p><p>&ldquo;If \nthey have water elementals, this isn&rsquo;t going to last very long,&rdquo; \nTodoroki murmured, rushing towards Kirishima. &ldquo;We might be able to cut \nthrough the chains with my ice. Do you have any offensive spells?&rdquo; he \nasked.</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Only healing magic!&rdquo; she gasped, shaking her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try ice. If we can at least break the ones on his wings we can get him out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The arena is covered!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered, glancing around. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s at least get the chains off and then we can try and find an escape route.&rdquo;</p><p>As\n the two approached, Kirishima bucked backwards, tossing his legs into \nthe air and shaking his head, the chains rattling against his back.</p><p><i>'They&rsquo;re gonna fucking help you, moron!&rsquo;</i>\n Bakugou huffed. He turned his head towards the sky. He could possibly \nbreak the structure if he slammed his back against the large metal beams\n covering the surface.</p><p>Pressing his feet close to the ground, he \nlaunched himself into the air, the wind from his wings pushing the fire \nout and causing the guards to fall backwards. Idiots. Did they really \nthink they could beat his fire?</p><p>&ldquo;WAVE!&rdquo; One of the guards called out, a giant rush of water pushing towards the flames.</p><p>Fucking shitty humans and their shitty magic!</p><p>Bakugou\n pushed his back against the metal, crying out loudly when he hit \nagainst the bars. It hurt, but it certainly made a dent. If they could \nget the chains off of Kirishima&rsquo;s wings, the two of them could probably \ndo it together.</p><p>As they ran close to Kirishima, Uraraka held her \nstaff out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get us higher!&rdquo; she breathed. She never used her \ngravity magic on two people before, but desperate times called for \ndesperate measures.</p><p>&ldquo;FLOAT!&rdquo; she cried out, tapping both of \nTodoroki&rsquo;s feet. He began to rise, his hair floating upwards. &ldquo;F-FLOAT!&rdquo;\n she called out once more, tapping her own two feet. She reached for \nTodoroki&rsquo;s hand, pushing herself off of the ground, she flung them up \nwith momentum, the two of them landing on Kirishima&rsquo;s wing.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Uraraka?&rdquo; Todoroki asked, looking at her with concern.</p><p>&ldquo;F-Fine,&rdquo; she gasped, kneeling on Kirishima&rsquo;s wing.</p><p>He\n nodded, knowing they didn&rsquo;t stand a chance if they kept wasting time. \n&ldquo;Freeze!&rdquo; he cried out and ice wrapped around Kirishima&rsquo;s wing, the cold\n substance covering his red, scaly skin.</p><p>&ldquo;WAVE!&rdquo; More guards were \narriving, waves of water covering the flames Bakugou kept attempting to \nreplenish. Uraraka glanced up, watching Bakugou push against the metal \nbeams. He looked exhausted, and she was worried he was using too much of\n his magic. Either way, she supposed him overworking himself a little \nwas better than them all dying.</p><p>The red dragon cried out and began\n to flap his wing, the ice starting to crack against the metal, the \nchains about the snap. Todoroki leaped forward, landing directly on \nKirishima&rsquo;s back. He held his hand out, casting the spell to wrap the \nice around his other wing.</p><p>The dragon rolled his back, shaking out as his entire body shivered, bucking underneath the smaller humans.</p><p>&ldquo;FREEZE!&rdquo; Guards called out, shooting ice in the direction of Kirishima.</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki!&rdquo; Uraraka cried, gesturing towards the ice headed directly towards them.</p><p>He\n whipped his body around, holding his other hand out as he felt the \nchains heat up against his hand. &ldquo;FIRE!&rdquo; he yelled, shooting flames from\n the jewels against his palm, the flames melting the ice it immediately \ncame into contact with.</p><p>&ldquo;Uraraka!&rdquo; Todoroki cried out, holding his other hand out to her. &ldquo;We have to hold on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;R-Right,&rdquo;\n she cried out, jumping forward to take his hand. She clung to him hard \nas Kirishima&rsquo;s wings spread, breaking the frozen ice.</p><p>Todoroki lunged forward, grabbing at one of the chains around his neck as he clung to Uraraka hard. &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; she gasped as Kirishima pushed into the air.</p><p>The\n two dragons nodded to each other, slamming their backs against the \nmetal bars. Bakugou huffed, shooting flames down at the guards in front \nof him. The dragon&rsquo;s fire was far more overpowering than Todoroki&rsquo;s, and\n any ice that shot their way was far too small and not high enough to \nreach them.</p><p>With another slam, the bars bent upwards, leaving enough space for them to escape, dashing into the air.</p><p>Uraraka\n clung to Todoroki, the wind whipping against her cheeks as she slammed \nher eyes shut, hoping they would land somewhere far, far away from any \nother villages or towns.</p><p>~~</p><p>It took about an hour of flying \nto get anywhere away from civilization. They flew over towns and \nvillages and Ochako was certain rumors would be flying now.</p><p>As \nthey made their way towards the mountains, Bakugou nodded his head \ntowards a large cave on the side, flying down towards it, landing \nagainst the large ledge.</p><p>Kirishima followed closely behind and \nwhen he pressed his feet to the ground, he bowed his head down, allowing\n Ochako and Todoroki to slip down to the ground.</p><p>Her brown hair \nfluttered about her face and Todoroki&rsquo;s looked as it had been slicked \nback, the force of the wind was so strong high in the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t believe we made it&hellip;&rdquo; Ochako whispered, her hands trembling against her staff.</p><p>&ldquo;Same&hellip;&rdquo;\n Todoroki muttered and quickly turned around towards Kirishima. &ldquo;I could\n probably freeze the muzzle off in the same way if you don&rsquo;t mind your \nmouth being cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima&rsquo;s ears perked up and he leaned down, \ncrouching close the ground. Holding his palm out, Todoroki breathed the \nword out and ice curled around Kirishima&rsquo;s snout, freezing the chains. \n&ldquo;Give it a moment and you should be able to break them with your jaw.&rdquo;</p><p>Ochako turned towards Bakugou, wondering if he would be able to change back. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; she asked, stepping towards him.</p><p>He growled, turning his head away from her for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s okay&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>He\n let out another growl, his body lurching forward as he began to shrink \nback to his human form. Immediately, he fell to his knees, his chest \nheaving, coughs slipping between his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bakugou!&rdquo; she \ngasped, running to him. Scales littered his face once again, his long \nears twitching as he tried to catch his breath. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in pain,&rdquo; she \nsaid softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m fucking fine!&rdquo; he snapped, his body \nalmost completely back to normal minus the scales on his face, his ears \nand his dragon wings. &ldquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Please let me help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\n can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he hissed, feebly attempting to pull away from her. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t \nfucking give me magic, so what the hell do you plan on doing!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if I heal you, you can pull your wings back&hellip; at the very least.&rdquo;</p><p>His\n wings fluttered behind him, his face wincing. They looked heavy against\n his body, and his panting grew heavier. &ldquo;Fuck. Do&hellip; whatever you want.\n It&rsquo;s not going to work!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-It might,&rdquo; she whispered, pressing \nher hand to his chest. Her hand felt heated, the small hum of magic \nreturning under her palm. She pressed her staff over his heart, and shut\n her eyes. &ldquo;Cure,&rdquo; she whispered, her palm feeling hot.</p><p>&ldquo;Ngh&hellip;&rdquo; \nhe grunted, his head dropping back. He winced, his back arching as his \nwings slowly began to fold back towards his body. The large bruises on \nhis back slowly disappeared, and the searing pain in his chest, back, \nand neck dissipated as well.</p><p>This woman&hellip; had far more magical \nability than she let on. How could such a small body hold so much power?\n He didn&rsquo;t underestimate her, never had, and definitely never would. \nWatching her walk into the arena with such confidence earlier was hard \nto ignore&hellip; and even now, watching her be so certain about what her \npower could do. It was something she never tried, and yet she was so \nconfident she could help his transformation.</p><p>And she was right apparently.</p><p>Ochako\n swallowed, her brown eyes turning up towards him. &ldquo;T-There&hellip;&rdquo; she \nwhispered. Her hand pressed against his chest as she tried to push back.\n Her arm trembled and her breathing grew heavy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you could&hellip; \ns-shift just&hellip; a little more&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! What did you do?&rdquo; Bakugou growled.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I healed you&hellip;&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;You\n used too much magic, didn&rsquo;t you!?&rdquo; Snapping at her, he shook her \nshoulders in an attempt to keep her awake. But her eyes fluttered shut, \nand her head rolled forward. &ldquo;Uraraka!&rdquo; Bakugou yelled as she slumped \nagainst him, completely passed out.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! Half and Half!&rdquo; Bakugou yelled. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s wrong with Cheeks!&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki\n glanced away from Kirishima, closing his palm. The ice was settling \naround the muzzle and he nodded, letting the dragon wait. He pushed up, \nwalking over to Bakugou, his eyes widening when he saw her face pressed \nagainst Bakugou&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fucking know!&rdquo; Bakugou yelled. &ldquo;She started healing me to help me shift back and then she fuckin&rsquo; just&hellip; passed out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She overused her magic,&rdquo; Todoroki muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how the hell that&rsquo;s even possible, since you idiots don&rsquo;t use magic through your fucking bodies!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;\n not exactly. The source of magic doesn&rsquo;t come from our bodies, no, but \nthe magical current flows through us when we activate the items we use. \nSo technically it does use her energy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I did feel an odd hum \nagainst her hand when she used her goddamn magic. I told her she didn&rsquo;t \nhave to!&rdquo; he growled, holding her in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip; A weird hum?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, when she had her hand on my chest,&rdquo; Bakugou snapped, his gaze fixated on the girl in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm&hellip;&rdquo;\n Todoroki tapped his chin, looking at the two of them. It was odd&hellip; \nsomething like that shouldn&rsquo;t have come from her hand, but her staff \nrather. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a fire started,&rdquo; he said, backing away. &ldquo;Let her rest,\n her energy will replenish and she will wake up.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Bakugou muttered, his hand touching her brown hair.</p><p>He\n cared about her far more than he let on. Even after the fire started, \nit took Bakugou a moment to lay her down, covering her with his cloak.</p><p>&ldquo;Watch her,&rdquo; he demanded, pointing to Todoroki.</p><p>&ldquo;I will, you have nothing to worry about. She just needs sleep,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled, heading away from the fire and out onto the ledge. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Kirishima.&rdquo;</p><p>With\n the muzzle having been frozen off, Kirishima only had a chain around \nhis neck, his body able to move as freely as possible. He turned his \nhead towards the two humans, and glanced back at Bakugou who was \ntraipsing towards the edge of the cave. He plopped down on the edge, \ndangling his legs over the side.</p><p>Kirishima followed, laying down next to him, curling his tail to the side.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to leave,&rdquo; Bakugou said.</p><p><i>'So fast? You&rsquo;re going to miss that human girl!&rsquo;</i> Kirishima&rsquo;s tone was taunting, and his head moved up and down with his laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to fucking miss her. We have bigger problems. You can&rsquo;t change back can you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'No&hellip; I thought if I was away from that village I might be able to when things calmed down but&hellip; I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking&hellip; dammit!&rdquo; he hissed, slamming his fist against the \nstone ground. &ldquo;Humans&hellip; aren&rsquo;t stealing our magic. They can&rsquo;t even use \nit on their own.&rdquo;</p><p><i>'What!?&rsquo;</i> Kirishima lifted his head, glancing back at the two human mages inside the cave.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.\n They need a fucking&hellip; I dunno&hellip; magical object or some bullshit!&rdquo; He \ngestured back towards them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Half and Half has those weird \nhand things and Cheeks has the staff,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'How&hellip; did you meet them exactly?&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>Bakugou rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Look my magic isn&rsquo;t doing great \neither and I got captured in a village&hellip; but Cheeks has some kind of \ndragon fetish so she rescued me. It got her banished from her town and \nwe went to the city to find Half and Half, another dragon fanatic. He \nheard rumors of you and I came to fucking get you. The end. Now we have \nto go home, we don&rsquo;t have time to dick around here worrying about \nhumans.&rdquo;</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'Wait&hellip; you got her banished from her town and you&rsquo;re just&hellip; gonna ditch her!? She saved you, dude!&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell else am I supposed to do?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done \nhanging out with humans and we&rsquo;re not any closer to solving this damn \nproblem!&rdquo;</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'Take them with us.&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;To the island!? Yeah right,&rdquo; Bakugou huffed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m\n doing that. We&rsquo;ll wait for her to wake up and then we&rsquo;re leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'You&rsquo;re really okay with just leaving her behind?&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I already fuckin&rsquo; told you. I&rsquo;m done here.&rdquo;</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>'You&rsquo;re an idiot. As always.&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it, Red Scales!&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment he glanced behind \nhimself, seeing her small form lying on the ground. He couldn&rsquo;t take her\n with him&hellip; not anymore. He&rsquo;d let her tag along for far too long, and \nhe was finished.</p><p>~~</p><p>Ochako&rsquo;s body ached and her eyes \nfluttered open. Pressed against her nose was Bakugou&rsquo;s cloak, the fur \ntickling her skin. It smelled nice though, sweet comforting. Over the \npast week, she had grown used to his smell, and took an odd amount of \ncomfort in it.</p><p>She pushed herself up, noting the fire seemed to be dimming, the flames flickering out.</p><p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; Cheeks. Took you long enough to wake up,&rdquo; Bakugou snorted, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bakugou!&rdquo; she gasped, turning around to face him. &ldquo;How long was I out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All\n of yesterday afternoon and night&hellip; It&rsquo;s morning now,&rdquo; Todoroki said \nstretching up. &ldquo;You need to be more careful about how you use your \nmagic.&rdquo;</p><p>Her gaze flicked down towards her staff. &ldquo;I know. I just&hellip; wanted to help.&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki sighed. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do much help if you drain yourself dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;HAH!? You could&rsquo;ve DIED!?&rdquo; Bakugou yelled, standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; technically&hellip;&rdquo; she chuckled awkwardly.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo;\n hell, Uraraka. What the fuck are you thinking?!&rdquo; He ran his hand \nthrough his spiky blond locks, his face twitching with anger.</p><p>She frowned, turning to stand up, glaring at the golden dragon. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to suffer! You were in pain!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n would&rsquo;ve been fuckin&rsquo; fine. Nothing to kill yourself over!&rdquo; he snapped.\n &ldquo;Fuck. You&rsquo;re so fucking reckless, it&rsquo;s a good thing we&rsquo;re leaving soon\n so you can go be normal somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>She froze, her eyebrow furrowing. &ldquo;Leaving?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\n Kirishima and I are going back to our island. We&rsquo;re not sticking \naround&hellip; here!&rdquo; he said, gesturing to the cave. &ldquo;We got shit we gotta \nfigure out.&rdquo;</p><p>Ochako glanced down at Todoroki. &ldquo;But what about us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll figure it out together I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Todoroki frowned, pushing himself. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re just going to leave us here in this cave? Far from any human civilization?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have to leave and we&rsquo;ve shown our goddamn dragon forms to enough people!&rdquo; Bakugou hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s a few more?!&rdquo; Todoroki snapped back. &ldquo;We just helped you. Uraraka has given up her life to keep you safe and <i>this</i> is how you&rsquo;re going to treat her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>Kirishima let out a whine, thumping his tail against the ground. He turned towards both mages, a sad look in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip; What are we supposed to do?&rdquo; Ochako said.</p><p>&ldquo;You can go back to your normal boring human life,&rdquo; he snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she yelled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go home! I&rsquo;m not allowed, remember?!&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou rolled his eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my fucking problem. That was your goddamn choice!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We all could&rsquo;ve died trying to rescue your friend,&rdquo; Todoroki stated bluntly.</p><p>&ldquo;Again, you didn&rsquo;t have to fucking help me!&rdquo; he snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;So you could&rsquo;ve handled that on your own?&rdquo; Ochako asked. &ldquo;Excuse me for caring!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to care!&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>&ldquo;And\n what do you plan on doing when you get back to your island? You&rsquo;re \ngoing to have to change forms to get there! Will you be able to fully \ntransform back?&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;The only way you were able to get back to\n normal was by using my magic!&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou froze, glaring at the girl. Did she really think he <i>needed</i> her? Yes, she helped him far more than he wanted her to. And he couldn&rsquo;t deny it was her magic that helped him&hellip; but&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you really just okay with leaving us behind?&rdquo; she said softly.</p><p>Kirishima snorted, huffing as he swung his body around, sitting next to Todoroki and Uraraka.</p><p>&ldquo;Is\n this you trying to tell me you&rsquo;re on their side? You want me to bring \nthem back with us? You really think we can just bring two fuckin&rsquo; <i>humans</i>\n back with us!?&rdquo; Bakugou growled, his long ears twitching against his \nhead. &ldquo;Fucking hell&hellip;&rdquo; He ran his hand through his blond hair again. \n&ldquo;No way. We&rsquo;re not bringing them.&rdquo;</p><p>His gaze fell upon Uraraka, her\n eyes filled to the brim with emotion. Her pupils trembled and he \ncouldn&rsquo;t tell if she was angry or sad.</p><p>&ldquo;F-Fine!&rdquo; she hissed, \nstorming past him before he could speak again. &ldquo;Maybe I don&rsquo;t even want \nto go with you!&rdquo; Her eyes narrowed, glaring at him as she headed towards\n the edge of the cave.</p><p>&ldquo;Uraraka-&rdquo; Todoroki called out, raising his\n hand up after her, but Bakugou was quick to cut him off, realizing what\n he needed to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it Half and Half! I&rsquo;ll go talk to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t\n seem like she wants to talk to you,&rdquo; Todoroki stated, pointing at her \nas she continued towards the entrance of the cave.</p><p>&ldquo;SHUT IT!&rdquo; he yelled, and immediately charged after her. &ldquo;Oi! Cheeks!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave me alone Bakugou!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this what you want?! You&rsquo;ve been trying to get rid of me this entire time!&rdquo;</p><p>He grabbed her arm and tried to stop her but she immediately yanked it away. &ldquo;Uraraka,&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t need you! I don&rsquo;t even want to stay with you!&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes. What a fucking liar she was.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&hellip; you can come with us,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n gee, thanks! How kind of you to allow it! Don&rsquo;t do me any favors, \nBakugou. I&rsquo;m finally taking the hint!&rdquo; she yelled, tears streaming down \nher cheeks.</p><p>As brave and as tough as she was, he knew she really \nhad nowhere to go. Even if she went back with Todoroki, it most likely \nwouldn&rsquo;t feel like home to her. And though she technically chose to \nrescue him, it was still his fault she wasn&rsquo;t allowed to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi&hellip;&rdquo;\n he mumbled, hating how her face looked as she cried. The last thing he \nwanted to do was make her fuckin&rsquo; cry. &ldquo;I&hellip; I want you to come&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-What?&rdquo; she sniffed, wiping her eye on her sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to come with us,&rdquo; he said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;re just saying that!&rdquo; she yelled. Her round cheeks were blotchy and red from crying, her lip trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\n not! I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t ask you to care but you do. If it wasn&rsquo;t for \nyour stupid round cheeks, I&rsquo;d be fucking dead and so would Kirishima,&rdquo; \nhe growled. &ldquo;It&hellip; would be weird to be without you&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You\n would be!&rdquo; she scoffed, folding her arms over her chest. Why did she \nlook so cute when she was being such an indignant little shit?</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! Don&rsquo;t push it!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Just&hellip; fucking come okay? It&rsquo;ll be easier this way.&rdquo;</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. &ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; Sniffing once more, she wiped her eyes again.</p><p>&ldquo;G-Good&hellip;&rdquo;\n he muttered, his cheeks turning a gentle shade of red, even over his \ngolden scales. &ldquo;J-Just&hellip; will you quit crying now?&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;It \ndoesn&rsquo;t look good on your face&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Her pink cheeks grew even pinker, and she smiled. &ldquo;Sorry, Bakugou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi,\n what the hell! Don&rsquo;t apologize! Just don&rsquo;t&hellip; don&rsquo;t do it anymore!&rdquo; he \nscoffed, gently pushing on her forehead with his finger.</p><p>Her lips curled up into a smirk. &ldquo;Admit it&hellip; if you left me behind, you probably would&rsquo;ve missed me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Cheeks. S'got nothing to do with that.&rdquo; Immediately, he turned away from her.</p><p>&ldquo;I bet you would!&rdquo; she giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it!&rdquo; he clenched his fists, looking at her cute smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she teased, leaning towards him. &ldquo;Not until you admit it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make you shut up!&rdquo; he snapped, grabbing her cheeks and pulling their lips together.</p><p>She\n froze, a muffled &ldquo;Mmph!&rdquo; slipping from her lips, but after taking a \nmoment to process, she kissed him back. Her mouth pressed against his, \nher hand curling into a fist against his chest. He nipped at her lower, \nfinally giving her a proper kiss after the horrible lip smash she didn&rsquo;t\n remember.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t believe you just kissed me&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered\n when he finally pulled back. Her cheeks were flushed, her gaze flicking\n between his eyes and his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;You did it first,&rdquo; he shrugged, brushing his thumb over her cheek bone.</p><p>&ldquo;What?! No I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said, furrowing her brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he smirked. &ldquo;Guess you don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh!?!&rdquo; she gasped, stepping away from him, cupping her hands over her cheeks. &ldquo;W-When I woke up next to you in the inn&hellip;!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Bakugou nodded, letting her figure it out.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I kissed you?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me you loved me,&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>Her eyes widened, looking as if they were about to pop out of her head. &ldquo;W-W-WHAT!?!?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. You said dragons were so cool,&rdquo; he teased .</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I-I\n meant dragons! O-Obviously! I love DRAGONS! Not you specifically, but \nmore&hellip; by, uh, proxy? Since you&rsquo;re a dragon and all&hellip;!&rdquo; she said, \nshaking her head back and forth rapidly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure Round Face,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;Whatever you say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I bet I didn&rsquo;t even kiss you and you&rsquo;re just&hellip; you&rsquo;re just making it up!&rdquo; she snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. Definitely happened. Does it really matter? We just kissed again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;It&hellip;. it matters!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;\n he snorted, trying to play it as casual as possible. Inside, his heart \nwas throbbing against his chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a fuckin&rsquo; kiss. Look,&rdquo; he \ngrunted and leaned forward and brushed there lips together. &ldquo;We just did\n again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;EH!?&rdquo; she squeaked, her cheeks still bright red. &ldquo;It&hellip; it would&rsquo;ve been my first! Or this one was!&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh&hellip;\n guess I got your first kiss then,&rdquo; he said, shrugging. She stared at \nhis lips again and blushed, backing away. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going. We can&rsquo;t \nstay in this fucking cave all day.&rdquo; He turned away from her, unable to \nlook at how cute her blushing face was.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Hey! You can&rsquo;t just walk away after kissing me!&rdquo; she yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;I can, and I will,&rdquo; he smirked. &ldquo;We gotta get going. I don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in this cave forever.&rdquo;</p><p>He\n continued back towards Kirishima and Todoroki, both looking confused at\n what transpired between the two of them. From deep in the cave, they \nhadn&rsquo;t seen what happened between the two.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving,&rdquo; Bakugou said. &ldquo;Get ready to hold on tight, cause Kirishima is going to fly us back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All of us?&rdquo; Todoroki asked, tilting his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Just shut the fuck up and do it.</p><p>Kirishima stomped his foot on the ground, narrowing his eyes at Bakugou.</p><p>\"Oh shut up, you know I can&rsquo;t change. I might not be able to change back if I do!&rdquo; he scoffed, folding his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Bakugou!&rdquo; Uraraka yelled, her voice echoing into the depths of the cave.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\n leaving Cheeks,&rdquo; he said, grabbing one of the chains around Kirishima&rsquo;s\n neck as he swung himself onto his back. Todoroki followed his move, \nclimbing onto the red dragon&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;You comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she tapped the bottoms of her feet with her staff. She supposed they would talk about the kiss&hellip; or <i>kisses</i> later.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>",

Now an adult and professional mage, \nshe&rsquo;s ready to help her parents as a healer for their village. The last \nthing she expects is for her beliefs to become a reality, but when a \ndragon attacks her village, she learns there&rsquo;s more to magic than she \never could&rsquo;ve realized.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16804609/chapters/41365580\">Read on AO3</a><br /><br />Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z3xF4a7jao2Xy-1acpZzw\">@its-love-u-asshole</a> for reading this over. <br /></small></p>\n<p><small>With a huff, Bakugou followed Uraraka and Todoroki to a large covered\n arena the townsfolk prepared for the dragon battle. Apparently this \ntown enjoyed tournaments and sports, and many people spent their time \ngambling here&hellip; it was possibly the worst place Kirishima could&rsquo;ve \nended up.</small></p>\n<p><small>He wrinkled his nose when they stepped into the arena, \nthe loud cheers and murmurings of humans hurting his ears. Deplorable \nfucking creatures. How the hell did they think it was okay to hurt an \nendangered creature. Did humans find something rare and immediately want\n to be rid of it?</small></p>\n<p><small>He glanced at Uraraka, gesturing to Todoroki \nabout something, he couldn&rsquo;t hear her over the large roaring of the \ncrowd. He supposed not all humans were bad, and perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t fair \nfor him to make an assumption. Or maybe&hellip; it was just that he didn&rsquo;t \nhate <i>her</i>.</small></p>\n</p>",
