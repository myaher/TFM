She&rsquo;s even more beautiful if it was possible.</p><p>&ldquo;How long did it take her to break?&rdquo; She questions. </p><p>&ldquo;Ten minutes.&rdquo; He gives her a small smile that quickly fades when she doesn&rsquo;t return one. &ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything to say.&rdquo; Reagan says with annoyance on her voice. </p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Reagan&hellip;&rdquo; Chris groans and rubs his face when he realizes how horrible he must look. He&rsquo;s beard is grown out, unkept and unclean. His eyes have to be swollen from the tears that fell and there&rsquo;s probably dark bags under his eyes from the lack of sleep. All signs that he&rsquo;s having trouble coping with this, which could play into his favor but also cost him. There is a part of him that hopes she will see past his appearance, that beneath this mess he&rsquo;s still the man that is devoted to her. &ldquo;I want..I need you to know that I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He pleads. </p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She gives him a nod. &ldquo;I listened to your voicemails.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris mumbles a curse word under his breath, completely forgetting about those putrid calls. &ldquo;I was-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;-drunk?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I noticed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reagan, I was drunk. I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; He starts before abandoning his sentence he doesn&rsquo;t know where it was going or what point he was trying to make, she&rsquo;d see past any lie he&rsquo;d put up against her. He could blame it on her damn books but in truth it just goes to show how much she knows him. He looks up at her, catching her green eyes in his. Those beautiful emerald eyes he&rsquo;s missed waking up to force his heart to burst open. &ldquo;When are you coming home?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p><p>Chris inhales deeply, choking back a sob that threatens to escape. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know why.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because we had a fight?&rdquo;</p><p>Reagan forces an uncomfortable smile on her face, trying to be calm. They can do this, they can have a conversation. &ldquo;No, because we keep having the same fight and you&hellip;&rdquo; Reagan swallows and exhales slowly. &ldquo;you let a lot out a lot of shit last time and it&rsquo;s putting more shit into perspective and I&rsquo;m tired of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired of me showing you that I love you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Showing me you love me is cornering me in a room and hounding me over getting married? Even when I&rsquo;ve told you I don&rsquo;t multiple times?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is it wrong of me to want to marry the woman I love?&rdquo; He asks, resting his hands on the door jamb. His blood pressure is rising. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s wrong of you to keep asking when you already know what my answer is!&rdquo; She raises her voice. &ldquo;You act like everytime it comes up, I&rsquo;m gonna have this new answer that will fit your lifestyle.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My lifestyle? What the hell does that mean?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Chris maybe that if we never get married we&rsquo;re never going to move past this stage in our life.&rdquo; Reagan drops her hand from the doorknob and groans. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirty-two years old, Chris, I&rsquo;m not some nineteen year old kid who&rsquo;s still figuring life out, I know what I want. One of those decisions I&rsquo;ve made is that I don&rsquo;t want to get married and the other is that I want to have children and being told that if I don&rsquo;t bow down to your wishes that&rsquo;s never going to happen is completely bullshit.&rdquo; She swallows hard, filling with more anger. &ldquo;Why should I spend my time with someone who even though they want the same thing refuses to have that because they want a piece of paper that says we&rsquo;re married. You act like marriage is this big sign that I&rsquo;m okay with having a baby and being with you for the rest of our lives, I&rsquo;ve told you I want that. I don&rsquo;t know any other ways to get it to you. Do you want to me spell it out for you? Shout it to the world? I&rsquo;m okay with gaining weight, getting aches and pains, enduring god knows how many hours of labour to bring your child into this world and you&rsquo;re throwing a fit because I don&rsquo;t want to get married but I&rsquo;m willingly to push a six pound baby out of my fucking vagina for us. So tell me again, why marriage is a greenlight for us to have a family and be together? How do I even know marrying you would get us to that point? What if the next thing you decide is I have to stop working?.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any of that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s so much sarcasm on her voice that&rsquo;s trying to hide the tears forming in her eyes. &ldquo;You just said it, right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was mad.&rdquo; Chris argues, dropping his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I get mad, but I would never tell you we wouldn&rsquo;t move on if we didn&rsquo;t do something I wanted.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that.&rdquo; Chris lets out yet another sigh, growing annoyed by how many times he&rsquo;s done that instead of being able to talk. They haven&rsquo;t reached the point of no return yet but are slowly approaching it. &ldquo;I just&hellip; I want us to get married, I want&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, you&rsquo;re ridiculous.&rdquo; Reagan gives him dry laugh and turns back into her room, quickly slamming the door behind her. </p><p>Chris is taken back by the force behind the door and barely manages to get his fingers out of the way before they are smashed. &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; He lets with a frustrated breathe. His jaw clenches and he places his palm on the white door as if that will help him convey his emotions better.&ldquo;Re-Reagan.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Go home!&rdquo; She shouts from behind the door in a tone, he knows means he has to choose his words carefully. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going home without you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going home!&rdquo; </p><p>In an act of annoyance, he grabs the gold door knob and turns it, forcing the door open and is met with Reagan who&rsquo;s standing in the middle of the room with her hands in her hair. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I lock the fucking door?&rdquo; He hears her question in a quiet voice, mostly likely directed at herself. He looks around her room, the missing suitcase is against the wall near the bedroom, her latest book is left open on the couch, ruining the spine and he cringes over the anger she&rsquo;ll have when she realizes that. </p><p>&ldquo;Is this how it&rsquo;s going to happen? You decide that it&rsquo;s over and I don&rsquo;t get a say?&rdquo; He asks, slamming the door closed behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how breaks ups work. One person decides they can&rsquo;t do it anymore and leaves.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what I want.&rdquo; </p><p>She growls, throwing her arms in the air and facing him. &ldquo;You want one thing with a hundred stipulations that I have to follow in order to even achieve happiness.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I want us to get married, what is so bad about marriage?&rdquo; He asks. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want too, I don&rsquo;t need a ring, or paper or a fancy wedding to say I love you. I don&rsquo;t want it. I have never dreamed about a fancy wedding or my future husband, I just wanted to grow up, fall in love and be with that person. And that person is&hellip; you.&rdquo; Her voice starts to break and her tears are back. &ldquo;And as much as I love you, I can&rsquo;t see myself marrying you or anyone for that matter. Marriage has just been something I&rsquo;ve never wanted.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I want.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Reagan nods her head, finally letting a tear fall. &ldquo;but arguing about it and begging for it isn&rsquo;t getting us anywhere but back in the same mess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing right now! You came over here and still want to know why I&rsquo;m not marrying you even after I&rsquo;ve told you why. I&rsquo;m tired of talking about this.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris holds his arms out. &ldquo;Fine, you want to stop talking about it?&rdquo; He asks, clapping his hands together and wiping them against one another as if to clean his hands of the conversation. &ldquo;See done. No more, We won&rsquo;t discuss it anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo; Reagan begs. &ldquo;just go home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not until you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to live there anymore.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a stab to his gut and a bullet wound to his heart all at the same time, pain radiates through his body. She&rsquo;s shot him. She always comes back, always does. No matter the fight, she would always come back to him. He&rsquo;s in trouble now so he shifts gears, fearing he&rsquo;s at risk of losing her for good this time. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to get married.&rdquo; He lets out in a rushed tone. </p><p>&ldquo;Chris&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, listen to me.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s begging with a voice so broken it hurts, he grabs at her hand, squeezing it in his own. &ldquo;I want you in my life and If I have to give up marriage for you, I will. I want you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me that in ten years you won&rsquo;t bring it up?&rdquo; She watches him chew his lip and say a quiet yes. &ldquo;Even if we went to friends or family members weddings, you wouldn&rsquo;t ever bring it up?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;For you, yes.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a tremble in his voice that he wasn&rsquo;t as noticeable. </p><p>&ldquo;Then why spend six years berating me to marry you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an idiot, Rea. I&rsquo;ve been so caught up on this marriage idea that it&rsquo;s clouded everything.&rdquo;</p><p>Reagan swipes her thumb over his hand, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying and that&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t be together. You&rsquo;re always going to want to get married and I&rsquo;m not. If I stay with you and we don&rsquo;t get married, you&rsquo;ll resent me for not being able to give you that and I&rsquo;ll be unhappy because I can&rsquo;t. If we get married, who&rsquo;s to say you don&rsquo;t start to question why we got married one day? That you&rsquo;ll start to wonder if i married you because I wanted to or because you wanted me to?&rdquo; She inhales sharply. &ldquo;Either way one of us winds up hurt.&rdquo; </p><p>Chris stares at her as his own eyes fill with tears, his squeezing at her hand, silently begging her to stay. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give up what I believe in because you don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; She adds.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; He pleads, dropping her hand and holding her face instead. Their eyes met, both full of pain. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know but&hellip;&rdquo; She touches his thigh, rubbing his left jean pocket and sighs. &ldquo;that ring,&rdquo; She points out adding pressure to the circle hidden beneath the denim. &ldquo;that you carry around everywhere you go hoping one day I will say yes, is why I can&rsquo;t. You wouldn&rsquo;t have bought a ring, you wouldn&rsquo;t have carried it around with you all these years if you could just move on.&rdquo; </p><p>Chris is desperate, his heart is racing threatening to jump out of chest and he can feel himself getting dizzy, it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s taking the oxygen in the air. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to give me one more chance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you six years worth of chances.&rdquo; Chris stares into her eyes, shaking his head as she speaks. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep hurting you. If we don&rsquo;t get married, you&rsquo;ll be unhappy and if we do, I&rsquo;ll will be. Neither of us will win in this situation.&rdquo; </p><p>He leans down, capturing her lips in a kiss. It&rsquo;s soft and innocent. He can taste the mint on her breathe and salt from her tears, he can&rsquo;t say goodbye to her. &ldquo;I would be. I would be happy.&rdquo; He says against her lips. </p><p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Her hand pushes at his chest, forcing him to step back and she slips from his hands. </p><p>Chris stares at her, the woman he&rsquo;s been with and loved for six years, the woman whose future with him he had planned out after their second date. He envisioned everything, their anniversaries, wedding, the birth of their child. He saw it all. This wasn&rsquo;t in the plans. Losing her wasn&rsquo;t apart of it. &ldquo;Reagan, I don&rsquo;t want to get married.&rdquo;</p><p>She inhales deeply, glancing at the ceiling before stepping towards him. &ldquo;Tell me you love me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me you want to spend the rest of our lives together.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know I do.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me we&rsquo;re going to have a family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo; He says with a tear falling down his cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me I&rsquo;m all you need.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Tell me if we&rsquo;re going to get married in the future.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo; Chris closes his eyes and lets his tears fall. She played him. It was a dirty game that makes him want to scream with agony. He&rsquo;s going to have to say goodbye to her, the love of his life because he&rsquo;s an idiot who can&rsquo;t seem to move on from the subject of marriage. At this point, he doesn&rsquo;t even realize why it&rsquo;s so important to him anymore. His childhood was spent with hopeful wishes of his life, a husband and a family. A wife. a woman whose taken his name and promised to love him until they leave the earth. Now he&rsquo;s not married, not going to be getting married and he&rsquo;s just lost the woman he loves. </p><p>Reagan forces a smile as her own tears drop rapidly, she wraps her arms around Chris&rsquo; broad chest and sobs. They hold one another, wishing things were different that their ideas for the future matched because they want each other but fate had different plans. Six years worth of a relationship, six years of &lsquo;I love yous&rsquo; and mornings making breakfast. They rehearsed scripts, bought a home. Chris listened to her when she cried over fictional characters deaths or the outrageous theories she came up with when she couldn&rsquo;t stay awake to read her books any further. She held his hand when he went to the hospital with a bad case of the flu, stayed by his bed and kept him up to date on the scores for the football game. </p><p>Six years and it&rsquo;s over. </p><p>It&rsquo;s over. </p>",

He could blame it on her damn books but in truth it just goes to show how much she knows him. He looks up at her, catching her green eyes in his. Those beautiful emerald eyes he\u2019s missed waking up to force his heart to burst open. \u201cWhen are you coming home?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>Chris inhales deeply, choking back a sob that threatens to escape. \u201cWhy not?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause we had a fight?\u201d</p><p>Reagan forces an uncomfortable smile on her face, trying to be calm. They can do this, they can have a conversation. \u201cNo, because we keep having the same fight and you\u2026\u201d Reagan swallows and exhales slowly. \u201cyou let a lot out a lot of shit last time and it\u2019s putting more shit into perspective and I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired of me showing you that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing me you love me is cornering me in a room and hounding me over getting married? Even when I\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t multiple times?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs it wrong of me to want to marry the woman I love?\u201d He asks, resting his hands on the door jamb. His blood pressure is rising. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s wrong of you to keep asking when you already know what my answer is!\u201d She raises her voice. \u201cYou act like everytime it comes up, I\u2019m gonna have this new answer that will fit your lifestyle.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy lifestyle? What the hell does that mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Chris maybe that if we never get married we\u2019re never going to move past this stage in our life.\u201d Reagan drops her hand from the doorknob and groans. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-two years old, Chris, I\u2019m not some nineteen year old kid who\u2019s still figuring life out, I know what I want. One of those decisions I\u2019ve made is that I don\u2019t want to get married and the other is that I want to have children and being told that if I don\u2019t bow down to your wishes that\u2019s never going to happen is completely bullshit.\u201d She swallows hard, filling with more anger. \u201cWhy should I spend my time with someone who even though they want the same thing refuses to have that because they want a piece of paper that says we\u2019re married. You act like marriage is this big sign that I\u2019m okay with having a baby and being with you for the rest of our lives, I\u2019ve told you I want that. I don\u2019t know any other ways to get it to you. Do you want to me spell it out for you? Shout it to the world? I\u2019m okay with gaining weight, getting aches and pains, enduring god knows how many hours of labour to bring your child into this world and you\u2019re throwing a fit because I don\u2019t want to get married but I\u2019m willingly to push a six pound baby out of my fucking vagina for us. So tell me again, why marriage is a greenlight for us to have a family and be together? How do I even know marrying you would get us to that point? What if the next thing you decide is I have to stop working?.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d There\u2019s so much sarcasm on her voice that\u2019s trying to hide the tears forming in her eyes. \u201cYou just said it, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was mad.\u201d Chris argues, dropping his head.</p><p>\u201cI get mad, but I would never tell you we wouldn\u2019t move on if we didn\u2019t do something I wanted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d Chris lets out yet another sigh, growing annoyed by how many times he\u2019s done that instead of being able to talk. They haven\u2019t reached the point of no return yet but are slowly approaching it. \u201cI just\u2026 I want us to get married, I want\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d Reagan gives him dry laugh and turns back into her room, quickly slamming the door behind her. </p><p>Chris is taken back by the force behind the door and barely manages to get his fingers out of the way before they are smashed. \u201cFuck.\u201d He lets with a frustrated breathe. His jaw clenches and he places his palm on the white door as if that will help him convey his emotions better.\u201cRe-Reagan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo home!\u201d She shouts from behind the door in a tone, he knows means he has to choose his words carefully. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going home without you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going home!\u201d </p><p>In an act of annoyance, he grabs the gold door knob and turns it, forcing the door open and is met with Reagan who\u2019s standing in the middle of the room with her hands in her hair. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I lock the fucking door?\u201d He hears her question in a quiet voice, mostly likely directed at herself. He looks around her room, the missing suitcase is against the wall near the bedroom, her latest book is left open on the couch, ruining the spine and he cringes over the anger she\u2019ll have when she realizes that. </p><p>\u201cIs this how it\u2019s going to happen? You decide that it\u2019s over and I don\u2019t get a say?\u201d He asks, slamming the door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how breaks ups work. One person decides they can\u2019t do it anymore and leaves.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I want.\u201d </p><p>She growls, throwing her arms in the air and facing him. \u201cYou want one thing with a hundred stipulations that I have to follow in order to even achieve happiness.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI want us to get married, what is so bad about marriage?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want too, I don\u2019t need a ring, or paper or a fancy wedding to say I love you. I don\u2019t want it. I have never dreamed about a fancy wedding or my future husband, I just wanted to grow up, fall in love and be with that person. And that person is\u2026 you.\u201d Her voice starts to break and her tears are back. \u201cAnd as much as I love you, I can\u2019t see myself marrying you or anyone for that matter. Marriage has just been something I\u2019ve never wanted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Reagan nods her head, finally letting a tear fall. \u201cbut arguing about it and begging for it isn\u2019t getting us anywhere but back in the same mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now! You came over here and still want to know why I\u2019m not marrying you even after I\u2019ve told you why. I\u2019m tired of talking about this.\u201d</p><p>Chris holds his arms out. \u201cFine, you want to stop talking about it?\u201d He asks, clapping his hands together and wiping them against one another as if to clean his hands of the conversation. \u201cSee done. No more, We won\u2019t discuss it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d Reagan begs. \u201cjust go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to live there anymore.\u201d It\u2019s a stab to his gut and a bullet wound to his heart all at the same time, pain radiates through his body. She\u2019s shot him. She always comes back, always does. No matter the fight, she would always come back to him. He\u2019s in trouble now so he shifts gears, fearing he\u2019s at risk of losing her for good this time. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to get married.\u201d He lets out in a rushed tone. </p><p>\u201cChris\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me.\u201d He\u2019s begging with a voice so broken it hurts, he grabs at her hand, squeezing it in his own. \u201cI want you in my life and If I have to give up marriage for you, I will. I want you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that in ten years you won\u2019t bring it up?\u201d She watches him chew his lip and say a quiet yes. \u201cEven if we went to friends or family members weddings, you wouldn\u2019t ever bring it up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFor you, yes.\u201d There\u2019s a tremble in his voice that he wasn\u2019t as noticeable. </p><p>\u201cThen why spend six years berating me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot, Rea. I\u2019ve been so caught up on this marriage idea that it\u2019s clouded everything.\u201d</p><p>Reagan swipes her thumb over his hand, \u201cYou\u2019re lying and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t be together. You\u2019re always going to want to get married and I\u2019m not. If I stay with you and we don\u2019t get married, you\u2019ll resent me for not being able to give you that and I\u2019ll be unhappy because I can\u2019t. If we get married, who\u2019s to say you don\u2019t start to question why we got married one day? That you\u2019ll start to wonder if i married you because I wanted to or because you wanted me to?\u201d She inhales sharply. \u201cEither way one of us winds up hurt.\u201d </p><p>Chris stares at her as his own eyes fill with tears, his squeezing at her hand, silently begging her to stay. \u201cI can\u2019t give up what I believe in because you don\u2019t like it.\u201d She adds.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He pleads, dropping her hand and holding her face instead. Their eyes met, both full of pain. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know but\u2026\u201d She touches his thigh, rubbing his left jean pocket and sighs. \u201cthat ring,\u201d She points out adding pressure to the circle hidden beneath the denim. \u201cthat you carry around everywhere you go hoping one day I will say yes, is why I can\u2019t. You wouldn\u2019t have bought a ring, you wouldn\u2019t have carried it around with you all these years if you could just move on.\u201d </p><p>Chris is desperate, his heart is racing threatening to jump out of chest and he can feel himself getting dizzy, it\u2019s like she\u2019s taking the oxygen in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me one more chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given you six years worth of chances.\u201d Chris stares into her eyes, shaking his head as she speaks. \u201cI can\u2019t keep hurting you. If we don\u2019t get married, you\u2019ll be unhappy and if we do, I\u2019ll will be. Neither of us will win in this situation.\u201d </p><p>He leans down, capturing her lips in a kiss. It\u2019s soft and innocent. He can taste the mint on her breathe and salt from her tears, he can\u2019t say goodbye to her. \u201cI would be. I would be happy.\u201d He says against her lips. </p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Her hand pushes at his chest, forcing him to step back and she slips from his hands. </p><p>Chris stares at her, the woman he\u2019s been with and loved for six years, the woman whose future with him he had planned out after their second date. He envisioned everything, their anniversaries, wedding, the birth of their child. He saw it all. This wasn\u2019t in the plans. Losing her wasn\u2019t apart of it. \u201cReagan, I don\u2019t want to get married.\u201d</p><p>She inhales deeply, glancing at the ceiling before stepping towards him. \u201cTell me you love me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me you want to spend the rest of our lives together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me we\u2019re going to have a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d He says with a tear falling down his cheek. </p><p>\u201cTell me I\u2019m all you need.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p> \u201cTell me if we\u2019re going to get married in the future.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d Chris closes his eyes and lets his tears fall. She played him. It was a dirty game that makes him want to scream with agony. He\u2019s going to have to say goodbye to her, the love of his life because he\u2019s an idiot who can\u2019t seem to move on from the subject of marriage. At this point, he doesn\u2019t even realize why it\u2019s so important to him anymore. His childhood was spent with hopeful wishes of his life, a husband and a family. A wife. a woman whose taken his name and promised to love him until they leave the earth. Now he\u2019s not married, not going to be getting married and he\u2019s just lost the woman he loves. </p><p>Reagan forces a smile as her own tears drop rapidly, she wraps her arms around Chris\u2019 broad chest and sobs. They hold one another, wishing things were different that their ideas for the future matched because they want each other but fate had different plans. Six years worth of a relationship, six years of \u2018I love yous\u2019 and mornings making breakfast. They rehearsed scripts, bought a home. Chris listened to her when she cried over fictional characters deaths or the outrageous theories she came up with when she couldn\u2019t stay awake to read her books any further. She held his hand when he went to the hospital with a bad case of the flu, stayed by his bed and kept him up to date on the scores for the football game. </p><p>Six years and it\u2019s over. </p><p>It\u2019s over. </p></p>",

Those beautiful emerald eyes he\u2019s missed waking up to force his heart to burst open. \u201cWhen are you coming home?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>Chris inhales deeply, choking back a sob that threatens to escape. \u201cWhy not?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause we had a fight?\u201d</p><p>Reagan forces an uncomfortable smile on her face, trying to be calm. They can do this, they can have a conversation. \u201cNo, because we keep having the same fight and you\u2026\u201d Reagan swallows and exhales slowly. \u201cyou let a lot out a lot of shit last time and it\u2019s putting more shit into perspective and I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired of me showing you that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing me you love me is cornering me in a room and hounding me over getting married? Even when I\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t multiple times?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs it wrong of me to want to marry the woman I love?\u201d He asks, resting his hands on the door jamb. His blood pressure is rising. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s wrong of you to keep asking when you already know what my answer is!\u201d She raises her voice. \u201cYou act like everytime it comes up, I\u2019m gonna have this new answer that will fit your lifestyle.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy lifestyle? What the hell does that mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Chris maybe that if we never get married we\u2019re never going to move past this stage in our life.\u201d Reagan drops her hand from the doorknob and groans. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-two years old, Chris, I\u2019m not some nineteen year old kid who\u2019s still figuring life out, I know what I want. One of those decisions I\u2019ve made is that I don\u2019t want to get married and the other is that I want to have children and being told that if I don\u2019t bow down to your wishes that\u2019s never going to happen is completely bullshit.\u201d She swallows hard, filling with more anger. \u201cWhy should I spend my time with someone who even though they want the same thing refuses to have that because they want a piece of paper that says we\u2019re married. You act like marriage is this big sign that I\u2019m okay with having a baby and being with you for the rest of our lives, I\u2019ve told you I want that. I don\u2019t know any other ways to get it to you. Do you want to me spell it out for you? Shout it to the world? I\u2019m okay with gaining weight, getting aches and pains, enduring god knows how many hours of labour to bring your child into this world and you\u2019re throwing a fit because I don\u2019t want to get married but I\u2019m willingly to push a six pound baby out of my fucking vagina for us. So tell me again, why marriage is a greenlight for us to have a family and be together? How do I even know marrying you would get us to that point? What if the next thing you decide is I have to stop working?.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d There\u2019s so much sarcasm on her voice that\u2019s trying to hide the tears forming in her eyes. \u201cYou just said it, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was mad.\u201d Chris argues, dropping his head.</p><p>\u201cI get mad, but I would never tell you we wouldn\u2019t move on if we didn\u2019t do something I wanted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d Chris lets out yet another sigh, growing annoyed by how many times he\u2019s done that instead of being able to talk. They haven\u2019t reached the point of no return yet but are slowly approaching it. \u201cI just\u2026 I want us to get married, I want\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d Reagan gives him dry laugh and turns back into her room, quickly slamming the door behind her. </p><p>Chris is taken back by the force behind the door and barely manages to get his fingers out of the way before they are smashed. \u201cFuck.\u201d He lets with a frustrated breathe. His jaw clenches and he places his palm on the white door as if that will help him convey his emotions better.\u201cRe-Reagan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo home!\u201d She shouts from behind the door in a tone, he knows means he has to choose his words carefully. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going home without you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going home!\u201d </p><p>In an act of annoyance, he grabs the gold door knob and turns it, forcing the door open and is met with Reagan who\u2019s standing in the middle of the room with her hands in her hair. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I lock the fucking door?\u201d He hears her question in a quiet voice, mostly likely directed at herself. He looks around her room, the missing suitcase is against the wall near the bedroom, her latest book is left open on the couch, ruining the spine and he cringes over the anger she\u2019ll have when she realizes that. </p><p>\u201cIs this how it\u2019s going to happen? You decide that it\u2019s over and I don\u2019t get a say?\u201d He asks, slamming the door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how breaks ups work. One person decides they can\u2019t do it anymore and leaves.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I want.\u201d </p><p>She growls, throwing her arms in the air and facing him. \u201cYou want one thing with a hundred stipulations that I have to follow in order to even achieve happiness.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI want us to get married, what is so bad about marriage?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want too, I don\u2019t need a ring, or paper or a fancy wedding to say I love you. I don\u2019t want it. I have never dreamed about a fancy wedding or my future husband, I just wanted to grow up, fall in love and be with that person. And that person is\u2026 you.\u201d Her voice starts to break and her tears are back. \u201cAnd as much as I love you, I can\u2019t see myself marrying you or anyone for that matter. Marriage has just been something I\u2019ve never wanted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Reagan nods her head, finally letting a tear fall. \u201cbut arguing about it and begging for it isn\u2019t getting us anywhere but back in the same mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now! You came over here and still want to know why I\u2019m not marrying you even after I\u2019ve told you why. I\u2019m tired of talking about this.\u201d</p><p>Chris holds his arms out. \u201cFine, you want to stop talking about it?\u201d He asks, clapping his hands together and wiping them against one another as if to clean his hands of the conversation. \u201cSee done. No more, We won\u2019t discuss it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d Reagan begs. \u201cjust go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to live there anymore.\u201d It\u2019s a stab to his gut and a bullet wound to his heart all at the same time, pain radiates through his body. She\u2019s shot him. She always comes back, always does. No matter the fight, she would always come back to him. He\u2019s in trouble now so he shifts gears, fearing he\u2019s at risk of losing her for good this time. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to get married.\u201d He lets out in a rushed tone. </p><p>\u201cChris\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me.\u201d He\u2019s begging with a voice so broken it hurts, he grabs at her hand, squeezing it in his own. \u201cI want you in my life and If I have to give up marriage for you, I will. I want you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that in ten years you won\u2019t bring it up?\u201d She watches him chew his lip and say a quiet yes. \u201cEven if we went to friends or family members weddings, you wouldn\u2019t ever bring it up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFor you, yes.\u201d There\u2019s a tremble in his voice that he wasn\u2019t as noticeable. </p><p>\u201cThen why spend six years berating me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot, Rea. I\u2019ve been so caught up on this marriage idea that it\u2019s clouded everything.\u201d</p><p>Reagan swipes her thumb over his hand, \u201cYou\u2019re lying and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t be together. You\u2019re always going to want to get married and I\u2019m not. If I stay with you and we don\u2019t get married, you\u2019ll resent me for not being able to give you that and I\u2019ll be unhappy because I can\u2019t. If we get married, who\u2019s to say you don\u2019t start to question why we got married one day? That you\u2019ll start to wonder if i married you because I wanted to or because you wanted me to?\u201d She inhales sharply. \u201cEither way one of us winds up hurt.\u201d </p><p>Chris stares at her as his own eyes fill with tears, his squeezing at her hand, silently begging her to stay. \u201cI can\u2019t give up what I believe in because you don\u2019t like it.\u201d She adds.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He pleads, dropping her hand and holding her face instead. Their eyes met, both full of pain. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know but\u2026\u201d She touches his thigh, rubbing his left jean pocket and sighs. \u201cthat ring,\u201d She points out adding pressure to the circle hidden beneath the denim. \u201cthat you carry around everywhere you go hoping one day I will say yes, is why I can\u2019t. You wouldn\u2019t have bought a ring, you wouldn\u2019t have carried it around with you all these years if you could just move on.\u201d </p><p>Chris is desperate, his heart is racing threatening to jump out of chest and he can feel himself getting dizzy, it\u2019s like she\u2019s taking the oxygen in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me one more chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given you six years worth of chances.\u201d Chris stares into her eyes, shaking his head as she speaks. \u201cI can\u2019t keep hurting you. If we don\u2019t get married, you\u2019ll be unhappy and if we do, I\u2019ll will be. Neither of us will win in this situation.\u201d </p><p>He leans down, capturing her lips in a kiss. It\u2019s soft and innocent. He can taste the mint on her breathe and salt from her tears, he can\u2019t say goodbye to her. \u201cI would be. I would be happy.\u201d He says against her lips. </p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Her hand pushes at his chest, forcing him to step back and she slips from his hands. </p><p>Chris stares at her, the woman he\u2019s been with and loved for six years, the woman whose future with him he had planned out after their second date. He envisioned everything, their anniversaries, wedding, the birth of their child. He saw it all. This wasn\u2019t in the plans. Losing her wasn\u2019t apart of it. \u201cReagan, I don\u2019t want to get married.\u201d</p><p>She inhales deeply, glancing at the ceiling before stepping towards him. \u201cTell me you love me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me you want to spend the rest of our lives together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me we\u2019re going to have a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d He says with a tear falling down his cheek. </p><p>\u201cTell me I\u2019m all you need.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p> \u201cTell me if we\u2019re going to get married in the future.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d Chris closes his eyes and lets his tears fall. She played him. It was a dirty game that makes him want to scream with agony. He\u2019s going to have to say goodbye to her, the love of his life because he\u2019s an idiot who can\u2019t seem to move on from the subject of marriage. At this point, he doesn\u2019t even realize why it\u2019s so important to him anymore. His childhood was spent with hopeful wishes of his life, a husband and a family. A wife. a woman whose taken his name and promised to love him until they leave the earth. Now he\u2019s not married, not going to be getting married and he\u2019s just lost the woman he loves. </p><p>Reagan forces a smile as her own tears drop rapidly, she wraps her arms around Chris\u2019 broad chest and sobs. They hold one another, wishing things were different that their ideas for the future matched because they want each other but fate had different plans. Six years worth of a relationship, six years of \u2018I love yous\u2019 and mornings making breakfast. They rehearsed scripts, bought a home. Chris listened to her when she cried over fictional characters deaths or the outrageous theories she came up with when she couldn\u2019t stay awake to read her books any further. She held his hand when he went to the hospital with a bad case of the flu, stayed by his bed and kept him up to date on the scores for the football game. </p><p>Six years and it\u2019s over. </p><p>It\u2019s over. </p></p>",

All signs that he&rsquo;s having trouble coping with this, which could play into his favor but also cost him. There is a part of him that hopes she will see past his appearance, that beneath this mess he&rsquo;s still the man that is devoted to her. &ldquo;I want..I need you to know that I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He pleads. </p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She gives him a nod. &ldquo;I listened to your voicemails.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris mumbles a curse word under his breath, completely forgetting about those putrid calls. &ldquo;I was-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;-drunk?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I noticed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reagan, I was drunk.

If we get married, who&rsquo;s to say you don&rsquo;t start to question why we got married one day? That you&rsquo;ll start to wonder if i married you because I wanted to or because you wanted me to?&rdquo; She inhales sharply. &ldquo;Either way one of us winds up hurt.&rdquo; </p><p>Chris stares at her as his own eyes fill with tears, his squeezing at her hand, silently begging her to stay. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give up what I believe in because you don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; She adds.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; He pleads, dropping her hand and holding her face instead. Their eyes met, both full of pain. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know but&hellip;&rdquo; She touches his thigh, rubbing his left jean pocket and sighs. &ldquo;that ring,&rdquo; She points out adding pressure to the circle hidden beneath the denim. &ldquo;that you carry around everywhere you go hoping one day I will say yes, is why I can&rsquo;t. You wouldn&rsquo;t have bought a ring, you wouldn&rsquo;t have carried it around with you all these years if you could just move on.&rdquo; </p><p>Chris is desperate, his heart is racing threatening to jump out of chest and he can feel himself getting dizzy, it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s taking the oxygen in the air. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to give me one more chance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you six years worth of chances.&rdquo; Chris stares into her eyes, shaking his head as she speaks. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep hurting you. If we don&rsquo;t get married, you&rsquo;ll be unhappy and if we do, I&rsquo;ll will be. Neither of us will win in this situation.&rdquo; </p><p>He leans down, capturing her lips in a kiss. It&rsquo;s soft and innocent. He can taste the mint on her breathe and salt from her tears, he can&rsquo;t say goodbye to her. &ldquo;I would be. I would be happy.&rdquo; He says against her lips. </p><p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Her hand pushes at his chest, forcing him to step back and she slips from his hands. </p><p>Chris stares at her, the woman he&rsquo;s been with and loved for six years, the woman whose future with him he had planned out after their second date. He envisioned everything, their anniversaries, wedding, the birth of their child. He saw it all. This wasn&rsquo;t in the plans. Losing her wasn&rsquo;t apart of it. &ldquo;Reagan, I don&rsquo;t want to get married.&rdquo;</p><p>She inhales deeply, glancing at the ceiling before stepping towards him. &ldquo;Tell me you love me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me you want to spend the rest of our lives together.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know I do.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me we&rsquo;re going to have a family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo; He says with a tear falling down his cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me I&rsquo;m all you need.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Tell me if we&rsquo;re going to get married in the future.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo; Chris closes his eyes and lets his tears fall. She played him. It was a dirty game that makes him want to scream with agony. He&rsquo;s going to have to say goodbye to her, the love of his life because he&rsquo;s an idiot who can&rsquo;t seem to move on from the subject of marriage. At this point, he doesn&rsquo;t even realize why it&rsquo;s so important to him anymore. His childhood was spent with hopeful wishes of his life, a husband and a family. A wife. a woman whose taken his name and promised to love him until they leave the earth. Now he&rsquo;s not married, not going to be getting married and he&rsquo;s just lost the woman he loves. </p><p>Reagan forces a smile as her own tears drop rapidly, she wraps her arms around Chris&rsquo; broad chest and sobs. They hold one another, wishing things were different that their ideas for the future matched because they want each other but fate had different plans. Six years worth of a relationship, six years of &lsquo;I love yous&rsquo; and mornings making breakfast. They rehearsed scripts, bought a home. Chris listened to her when she cried over fictional characters deaths or the outrageous theories she came up with when she couldn&rsquo;t stay awake to read her books any further. She held his hand when he went to the hospital with a bad case of the flu, stayed by his bed and kept him up to date on the scores for the football game. </p><p>Six years and it&rsquo;s over. </p><p>It&rsquo;s over. </p></p>",
