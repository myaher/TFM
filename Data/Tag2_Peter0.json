Ok.&rdquo; Pepper made her way into Y/N&rsquo;s room expecting to see Peter and her asleep wrapped in a blanket but instead, she saw an empty bed, blankets gone. Pepper&rsquo;s eyes widened, breath hitched quickly she checked the drawers, slightly feeling relieved when the clothes were still there. Pepper made her way down the stairs opening the front door she saw the two teenagers laying on the dock. Pepper quietly made her way towards them, seeing dried tears on their cheeks, faces are swollen, Peter&rsquo;s head rested on Y/N&rsquo;s chest; arms firmly wrapped around her waist. Y/Ns hand remained in Peter&rsquo;s hair, slight smiles appeared on their faces. Pepper couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the two, she walked away careful not to wake them.</p><p>&ldquo;May?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you find him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s here.

Phil smiled at him and Tony rolled his eyes. Phil wasn&rsquo;t about to get Y/N in trouble she was already scared as it is, Phil turned around nodding his head forward, Y/N turned around making her way towards the door when she bumped into a solid wall.

Was he really about to tell a story to this girl? This was a trick a way to get more information out of him, he needed to get the job done, he would not fail, he would not break.</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Can you please start?

Loki continued his story and soon her stomach growled.</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I shall finish this another time little one.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Noo, you&rsquo;re almost done.

No matter how many times Y/N did this, Peter could feel his heart speed up, as if it were about to pop out of his chest, his face flushed, breathing shaky. If only she knew what she did to him, Y/N felt the same way.\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Well looks like a couple of scraps on your face, a cut lip and a bruise on your cheek, not too bad today.&rdquo; Y/N pulled the first aid kit from her drawer and tended to Peter&rsquo;s wounds.

Peter always slept on the floor surrounded by blankets and pillows while Y/N slept in her bed. Y/N&rsquo;s heartbeat echoed in her ears, it was beating fast it was too loud, she was nervous Peter could hear it, but all Peter could hear was the sound of his own heart. Peter climbed into the bed and laid down next to Y/N.</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y can you lower the lights the 15%.&rdquo; The lights dimmed, even more, a slight glow still illuminated the room. Y/N was scared of the dark, bad things happened in the dark. Y/N rolled on her side, staring at the side of Peter&rsquo;s face, Peter rolled over to face Y/N, he smiled at her, reaching out, he moved the start strand of her hair away from her face, Y/N smiled</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Good night Peter.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Good night Y/N.&quot;\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i><b>6:30am</b></i></p><p>Peter groaned cuddling into Y/N\u2019s neck, even more, his hair tickling Y\u2019N\u2019s nose, it twitched. They both haven\u2019t slept so peacefully in weeks, Peter\u2019s arms wrapped right around Y/N bringing her peace she\u2019s never known before, a calming of the storms in her heart. Peter believes it&rsquo;s her that gives him hope for the future. In each other\u2019s embrace, they start to believe that there is nothing out there to fear, that all there is, is sunshine. Peter groaned once again once he heard giggling and saw a faded flash from his closed eyes he slowly opened his eyes to see Morgan standing in front of them with a Polaroid camera in hand. Peter sat up slightly, Morgan\u2019s brown eyes widened she ran away while giggling. Y/N groaned and she felt Peter shift stretching her arm out wrapping it around Peter\u2019s waist he laid back down and ran his fingers through her h/c hair, Peter smiled looking down at her, her chest rising and falling, her eyelids slightly fluttering, mouth slightly open, drool making its way down her cheek. Peter laughed, Y/N groaned feeling Peter\u2019s chest vibrate</p><p>\u201c5 more minutes..\u201d Y/N mumbled against his chest</p><p>\u201cAs much as I want that, it\u2019s almost 7.\u201d Y/N shot up getting slightly light headed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Peter rolled over grabbing his phone showing her the time. 6:40am\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u201cOh my god! We\u2019re going to be late!\u201d Peter leaned on his side staring at Y/N looking around frantically then she stopped realizing what she probably looked like.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! Peter close your eyes.\u201d Y/N squealed placing her hand over his eyes. Peter laughed</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Grabbing her hand and pulling it down, Y/N raced to place her other hand over his eyes</p><p>\u201cBecause I probably look like a mess.\u201d Peter moved her hand once again and looked into her e/c eyes</p><p>\u201cYou look perfect,\u201d he whispered. Y/N felt her face flush, Peter felt the same, his face bright red then a flash disrupted them, turning their heads to see Morgan standing there with a big smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cMama told me to come and get you guys because breakfast is ready,\u201d and with that Morgan ran off into the house. Y/N shook her head standing up Peter followed her movements, grabbing his backpack and picking up the blanket</p><p>\u201cI can take that Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s fine, just lead the way.\u201d Peter followed Y/N into the house, their noses greeted with the smell of eggs, bacon, and toast. Pepper stood in front of the island arms across her chest, eyebrows raised. Y/N flinched she had a whole lot of explaining to do.</p><p>\u201cGood morning Pepper.\u201d Y/N whispered as she sat on the chair</p><p>\u201cGood morning Mrs. Stark,\u201d Peter mumbled with his head down sitting next to Y/N</p><p>\u201cGood Morning Y/N, Peter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood morning Y/N, Peter!\u201d Morgan yelled out sitting on the other side of Y/N</p><p>\u201cMorning Morgan.\u201d The two teens replied</p><p>\u201cSo, do one of you want to talk or\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Pepper.

Peter frantically changed into his clothes grabbing his phone pressing the number one, he heard the phone ring.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt May? I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t call, Y/N messaged me and I came over, we started talking and we fell asleep.

I called Ned, MJ, hospitals and then when I called Pepper, she said that you had gone over and fell asleep. Do you know how worried I was? I thought something bad happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Aunt May\u2026\u201d Peter whispered out, he heard her sigh</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Peter, just please next time call me or text me. Also, you\u2019re grounded for a week, no patrolling, no TV and no going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Peter inwardly groaned, grounded a week and a half before the vacation, well at least she didn\u2019t say she couldn\u2019t go.</p><p>\u201cGet going, you\u2019re going to be late for school.

WAIT!\u201d Y/N turned around to see Morgan running towards the car, opening the door she looked down at her younger sister</p><p>\u201cHere..you&hellip;go!\u201d Morgan said gasping to catch her breathe she handed Y/N a brown bag</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t open it until you\u2019re alone.\u201d Morgan smiled and ran back into the house, Y/N closed the door and looked at Peter</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she give you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea, she said to open it when I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show you after I open it.\u201d Peter nodded and smiled.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Peter and Y/N made it to school 20 minutes late, they tried sneaking past the office but failed now they are sitting in the principal&rsquo;s office, Y/N twirled her thumbs around, Peter didn&rsquo;t look nervous one bit he was used to this.</p><p>&quot;Miss. Stark and Mr. Parker, nice to see you again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t that late.&rdquo; The principal sighed</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let this slide because I understand that Miss Stark is going through a difficult time.&rdquo; Y/N met his eyes filled with pity. Y/N glared slightly, she hated being pitted on.</p><p>&ldquo;Get to class, both of you.&rdquo; Y/N stood along with Peter and went straight to the English class.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Lunch came around and Y/N smiled, chicken, mac and cheese, grapes and water. Y/N sat in the back remembering what Morgan gave her in the morning she opened her backpack and opened the brown bag. Y/N pulled out 12 Polaroid pictures that Morgan took in the morning, each a double. A little note fell from the pictures</p><p>One for you and one for Peter- Morgan</p><p>Y/N smiled and looked through each picture, one where Peter was laying on her chest arms wrapped around her waist a smile on his face, the next was of her laying on Peter&rsquo;s chest her arms wrapped around his waist a smile on her face, the next photo Peter was awake, kissing her forehead, Y/N blushed at the photo. When did he do that? She didn&rsquo;t even realize. The next photo was one of the two of them forehead to forehead, a smile on both their faces and slightly flushed. Moving to the next set it was of Peter moving a stray strand of hair away from Y/N\u2019s face and the last set was a photo that Happy took of Peter, Morgan and her, Morgan in Peter\u2019s arms, Peter made a funny face to make Morgan and Y/N laughed, Y/N smiled, they looked like a happy family. Y/N heard someone clear their throat quickly putting the photos away she looked up to see Flash staring at her.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what Penis-\u201d Y/N glared and Flash flinched</p><p>\u201cIs what Parker said true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he actually worked with Tony Stark and met all the other Avengers?\u201d Y/N lifted a brow</p><p>\u201cWhy so curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he is a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter doesn\u2019t lie. Yes, he worked with my father, aunts, and uncles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather? Tony Stark only has 1 kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you like one of those delusional fans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the fans who like to pretend they know the person. Let\u2019s be honest if you\u2019re Tony Stark\u2019s kid then I\u2019m Captain America\u2019s kid. If you are his kid, why have we never seen or heard of you? Was he embarrassed by you?\u201d Y/N felt tears prickle her eyes, was Tony embarrassed by her? No. He did it to protect her, he was Iron man she could have gotten hurt. Tony would never be embarrassed by her, he was proud of her.</p><p>\u201cI thought Parker was a liar, but you took first place.\u201d Y/N felt the tears rolled down her cheeks</p><p>\u201cFLASH!\u201d Flash turned towards the voice, Peter standing behind him, dropping his food, he raised his fist hitting Flash straight on the jaw, Flash fell to the ground clenching his jaw.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Parker!?\u201d Peter ignored him and sat next to Y/N, placing his hands on her cheeks he wiped her tears.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Y/N shook her head</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Grabbing her hand he pulled her out of the cafeteria, making his way to the roof of the school. Peter sat down, pulling her down with him. Y/N rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Peter.\u201d Peter turned to look at her</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry for? You have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you punched him, you might get suspended or expelled or worse you might not be able to go on the trip so you can forget about Spider-Man, my dad, Pepper, Morgan and me. You need to go on that trip to forget about everything.\u201d Y/N rambled lifting her head from his shoulder</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Peter caressed her face, forcing her to look at him</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to forget you. Ever. I\u2019m never going to forget Mr. Stark, Mrs. Stark or Morgan, you guys mean so much to me. Do you want to forget about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Y/N said confidently staring into his brown eyes, they twinkled when she said that.</p><p>\u201cI heard what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Y/N e/c eyes look down\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong you know. Mr. Stark loves you, he always mentioned you when I would visit the compound, how you managed to help build Veronica, an anti-gravity device,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one was a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he found out and you built my suit. Mr. Stark told me how proud he was when you finished the Iron Spider suit when I asked him about the suit he said \u201cKid, Y/N built it. I was worried at first because she started to be more and more like me, but she had this big smile on her face when working on your suit I couldn\u2019t stop her and when she finished it she ran to me screaming, yelling DAD DAD DAD I DID IT I DID IT. She dragged me into the lab and showed me the suit, her smile so wide, I\u2019m pretty sure her face hurt from how much she was smiling, my face hurt from smiling, I have never been so proud of her. I can just hope nothing happened to her.\u201d I just stared at him and thought he really loves her.\u201d Y/N felt the tears rolling down her cheeks once again. Peter smiled and wiped her tears</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d Y/N whispered</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Y/N calmed herself and grabbed her backpack, pulling out the brown bag.</p><p>\u201cReady to see?\u201d Peter nodded, Y/N pulled out the pictures and handed them to Peter. Peter looked at the polaroids sitting in his hands, his face turned red when he saw the sets. Peter never noticed how much of a couple they looked like, he loved the thought of it, did she even notice? Did she think about it? Peter saw the last set of photos, he was holding Morgan, his face scrunched up, tongue sticking out, Morgan and Y/N facing him laughing, he wanted to have a family with Y/N. Peter blushed at the thought, he let out a cough. Y/N smiled.</p><p>\u201cMorgan said one for me and one for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Peter chose his photos and handed the others back to Y/N. Peter pulled a folder from his bag and placed them in there. Y/N grabbed her bag and placed them in her notebook.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we head back?\u201d Peter sighed</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Come on.\u201d Y/N grabbed Peter\u2019s hand, standing and pulling him up with her. Y/N and Peter walked down the stairs hand in hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker, Miss Stark.\u201d They froze</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d Shit.\u00a0</p><p>Peter and Y/N sat in their chairs, shifting uncomfortably feeling May\u2019s stare and Pepper\u2019s stare burning holes into their faces. Flash sat on the right side of them with his father.</p><p>\u201cThank you all for coming, the reason you are all here is that Mr. Parker here hit Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d May said\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou hit someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I didn\u2019t do it on purpose or for no reason.\u201d May sighed, her fingers pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p>\u201cWe have a no violence policy in this school and I\u2019m considering taking Mr. Parker off the Europe trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d Y/N butted in</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Pepper warned her</p><p>\u201cBut Pepper, he can\u2019t do that. Flash was being a jerk to me and Peter protected me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO! You\u2019re seriously going to sit here and take the bully\u2019s side. Flash sat there and took me that I wasn\u2019t my dad\u2019s daughter and that I was nothing but disappointment and embarrassment to him.\u201d Y/N looked at Pepper, Pepper\u2019s blue eyes widened, reaching out placing her hand on Y/N\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cSweetie\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper, did dad ever feel that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, he never felt that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlash is this true?\u201d A deep rough voice spoke</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. There\u2019s no need to take Mr. Parker off the trip. I\u2019m willing to let this go since my son did decide to bully Miss Stark here. I\u2019m sorry Mrs. Stark. Apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Y/N looked at Flash</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d The group walked out of the office</p><p>\u201cY/N! PETER!\u201d Morgan ran towards the teens</p><p>\u201cHey, Morgan.\u201d They replied</p><p>\u201cPepper can we give Peter and May a ride home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Morgan stood between Peter and Y/N and held each of their hands, the three walked behind May and Pepper. Y/N looked over to Peter, they were in trouble.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Peter and May hopped out of the car before they reached the door Y/N hopped out of the car</p><p>\u201cMay,\u201d May turned around</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what happened wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know sweetie.\u201d May smiled</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on him.\u201d May laughed and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see at school tomorrow Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d Y/N waved, she got into the car and they drove off. Peter and May entered the building and into their apartment. Peter threw his backpack into his room and sat down on the couch, his leg bouncing up and down, fingers running through his hair. He heard May sigh and felt her sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted to protect her, but next time try not to hit him. Same rules apply, no patrolling, no going out, no TV and no phone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMay, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Peter.\u201d May smiled at her nephew</p><p>\u201cGood for you though, protecting your crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-What? I I don\u2019t have a crush on Y/N.\u201d May raised a brow</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter\u2019s blood rushed to his face</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d Peter asked shyly</p><p>\u201cUmm, just a tad.\u201d Peter groaned</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she likes me in that way anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Peter ran his fingers through his hair again</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just amazing, you know. She\u2019s insanely smart, funny, gentle, understanding and beautiful. And her smile May, God her smile, it lights up my world, it makes my heart race every time. I would do anything to keep that smile on her face. She makes me feel calm, safe and she feels like home like it\u2019s only the two of us and there\u2019s no evil in the world. She just takes my breath away.\u201d May stared at Peter, his face red, a shy smile on his face, brown eyes twinkled and filled with love. May knew that he watched her like she had the stars in her hands and soft petals at her feet, he wanted to wrap her in his arms and never let go. May smiled at Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn&rsquo;t like me? I don\u2019t want to ruin the friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a chance, Peter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll tell her on the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for listening to me May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to know about my nephew\u2019s crush. Y/N and Peter sitting in a tree,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay,\u201d Peter groaned</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, now go do homework, while I go make dinner and by make I mean do you want Chinese food?\u201d Peter laughed</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks May.\u201d Peter stood heading to his room</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Oh, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone. Suit.\u201d Peter inwardly groaned, he hopped she forgot about that, pulling his phone out, going into his room pulling his suit out and handing the items to May. Peter went back into his room and started on his homework.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>By the time the Starks made it home, it was dark out. Happy stopped at a fast food place and got them food. The trio said goodbye to Happy and made their way into the house. Y/N walked up the stairs throwing her backpack into the room and made her way back down the stairs, Y/N saw Pepper sitting on the couch, Morgan on the floor coloring in her book. Y/N sat next to Pepper.</p><p>\u201cPepper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t dad want anyone to know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was worried. Scared that something might happen to you.\u201d Y/N nodded, she remembered when her dad told her his worries, but she wanted to make sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he said that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel like this wouldn\u2019t have happened if you were still homeschooled, it\u2019s only been two days and you were already sent to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d Pepper laughed</p><p>\u201cWhat? Causing trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike father, like daughter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pepper, for everything.\u201d Pepper pulled Y/N into a hug</p><p>\u201cI wanna hug too.\u201d Morgan stood pouting</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Y/N opened her arm and Morgan joined the hug.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>1 day before the trip</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you taking your suit?\u201d Peter looked at Y/N\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just planning on relaxing.\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cSo, does MJ know yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Peter replied reaching for the bag of sour patches</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Y/N reached for a chocolate bar filled with almonds, Peter got other snacks for Ned and MJ</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I agreed to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed and MJ said it was a crime that you haven\u2019t seen Star Wars yet, so they said movie night. Plus we can all just carpool tomorrow to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sleepover, I only gave in because you gave me the puppy eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d Peter and Y/N walked to the register, she paid for the things. Peter and Y/N walked back towards his apartment, entering the apartment, she set the bag of snacks on the table\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi May, I brought you some chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYEAH?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCAN YOU COME AND HELP ME?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCOMING.\u201d Y/N walked into Peter\u2019s room, he was struggling with the blankets and pillows, rushing to him she grabbed a handful of pillows and a blanket. Y/N walked back into the living room, setting the stuff down on the couch</p><p>\u201cPeter is all this really necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He huffed out placing the blankets down. Peter turned and looked at the coffee table sitting in the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere should I move this?\u201d Peter mumbled</p><p>\u201cPeter just move it against the wall,\u201d May responded, Peter nodded easily picking up the table and moving it against the table, Y/N started setting the blankets down, the fluffiest ones on the bottom with the rest on top, placing the big fluffy pillows on top, she stepped back to admire her work, smiling she was satisfied. Peter stood next to Y/N, wrapping his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGood job Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Should we set up the screen now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe in a bit.\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cDo you guys want pizza for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Y/N and Peter replied</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll order now.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Peter laid on the edge of the blankets, Y/N next to him, MJ sat next to her and Ned next to MJ, all of them dressed in their PJs. They were about halfway through the movie, an empty pizza box in front of them along with wrappers from multiple snacks. Y/N could feel her eyes become heavy, Peter glanced at her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cGetting sleepy?\u201d Peter whispered in her ear</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re almost there, you can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Y/N shook her head and continued to watch the movie, the credits rolled on the screen</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ned asked</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was good. Should we put on another movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord of the rings?\u201d Ned asked MJ and Peter agreed. Y/N\u2019s eyes widened</p><p>\u201cUmmm, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Peter said</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen that either, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, what have you seen?\u201d MJ asked</p><p>\u201cUmm fandom wise just those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Peter go put it on.\u201d Peter stood and put the movie on, he snuggled back next to Y/N.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clean up before it starts.\u201d Y/N stood picking up the empty box and the wrappers, she stood in the kitchen throwing away the wrappers, folding the box and placing it on the counter. Y/N walked towards the blankets but stopped, MJ had moved over next to Peter, the two of them in a deep conversation, occasionally Ned would chime in. Y/N looked away and went into the restroom, sighing she grabbed her toothbrush and brushed her teeth. Y/N finished opening the door she made her way back to the blankets the movie had already started, she looked at Peter and MJ from the looks of it she had no plans in moving, Y/N sat next to Ned and quietly watched the movie. Y/N slowly started to become annoyed, she could hear their whispered and giggles every once in a while, they weren\u2019t including her in their conversation. Why should they? Y/N was an outcast in their group, they had been friends for a while now. Y/N just laid down and tried to ignore them, turning on her side she closed her eyes and fell asleep. Peter glanced at Y/N, he noticed she rolled her eyes, biting the inside of her cheek and eyes narrowed she was annoyed. Peter turned his attention back to MJ, why was she annoyed? Peter glanced back at Y/N, her back facing them, Ned noticed Peter\u2019s gaze and looked at Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe fell asleep.\u201d Peter chuckled</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Peter looked at the clock 11:15pm</p><p>\u201cWe should sleep too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d MJ and Ned agreed, the three rose carefully and made their way to the bathroom to brush their teeth. Ned and MJ finished and went back, Peter used the bathroom and walked back to the blankets, Ned had laid back down next to Y/N, he wanted to sleep next to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on Peter, we don\u2019t have all night.\u201d Peter looked at MJ and laid down next to her, Peter dimmed the lights</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d MJ and Ned replied, then they entered the world of darkness.</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>3:30am</p><p>Y/N rolled onto her back and groaned, slowly opening her eyes, she blinked. Why was it so dark? It&rsquo;s too dark in here, she couldn&rsquo;t see anything. Y/N sat up, back against the couch, reaching for her phone she turned on the flashlight, careful not to wake the others up, she stood and made her way into the bathroom. Peter heard the door close, he rolled over and noticed Y/N was missing from her spot, Peter sat up and sat on the couch. Y/N came out of the bathroom and squealed when she noticed a figure on the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d Peter whispered, Y/N relaxed and sat next to Peter</p><p>\u201cSorry for scaring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my senses kicked in and woke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooo, I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way, but it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to go back to sleep?\u201d Y/N asked</p><p>\u201cNightmare.\u201d Y/N nodded understanding</p><p>\u201cDo you think they have nightmares?\u201d Y/N asked cocking her head towards Ned and MJ</p><p>\u201cProbably normal ones, not about the snap or you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna talk about it?\u201d Y/N asked</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 We weren\u2019t able to stop Thanos and I turned around you&hellip; You were disappearing and Mr. Stark was lying on the floor, coughing up blood. I couldn\u2019t save you both.\u201d Peter felt Y/N\u2019s hand slip into his, she squeezed his hand</p><p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Peter said, looking at Y/N. Y/N scooted to the end of the couch and laid down, she opened her arms and patted her chest. Peter smiled and climbed into her arms, he snuggled against her neck, her fingers running through his curled brown hair.</p><p>\u201cNight Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Y/N.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Y/N woke up to the sound of a camera clicking. Not again, opening her eyes she saw me standing there taking pictures of the two teens</p><p>\u201cSorry, you just looked so adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c7. You guys should start getting up and ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d May turned and walked into the kitchen, Y/N looked down at Peter, running her fingers through his hair and whispering</p><p>\u201cPeter. Peter. Get up.\u201d Peter moaned and tightened his grip</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna.\u201d Y/N laughed</p><p>\u201cPeter, get up, we have to get ready and eat.\u201d MJ looked at Y/N and Peter on the couch</p><p>\u201cMorning MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning everybody,\u201d Ned said brightly</p><p>\u201cGood morning Ned.\u201d MJ and Y/N replied Peter moaned again</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep\u2026 five more minutes.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes</p><p>\u201cPete, get up. I\u2019m pretty sure Y/N wants to go brush her teeth and use the bathroom.\u201d Ned said</p><p>\u201cUghh, too comfy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, if you don\u2019t get up, I will use the secret weapon.\u201d Peter\u2019s head shot up, her stared int Y/N e/c eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me, Parker.\u201d Peter narrowed his eyes. Y/N lifted her hands, wiggling her fingers.</p><p>\u201cFine. Fine. I\u2019m up.\u201d Peter lifted himself from Y/N, she sat up and smiled</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter grumbled. Y/N made her way into Peter\u2019s room and grabbed her little bag filled with today\u2019s clothing. Y/N walked back into the living asking if anyone needed the restroom because she was going to shower, everyone replied no and Y/N went to shower.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Happy was not happy driving a car full of teenagers to the airport, the music was blasting, the boys were singing off-key and dancing around, the girls singing on key and just stook to bobbing their heads from side to side. Happy groaned, New York traffic was the worst, he wished they could just zoom through and he could finally have some peace and quiet. Y/N turned and looked at Happy, she lowered the music</p><p>\u201cSorry uncle Happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries Little Stark, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re smiling and having fun.\u201d Y/N smiled</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try and keep it down.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0 Happy pulled into the parking lot, helping the kids unload their luggage, he followed behind the group of teens, making sure they didn\u2019t get hurt or lost. Y/N saw the group of students along with Mr. Dell and Mrs. Warren. Y/N turned back to Happy</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in 2 weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in 2 weeks, little Stark.\u201d Y/N smiled, Happy opened his arms and she jumped into them.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing us Happy,\u201d Peter said</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Hogan.\u201d MJ and Ned chimed in. Y/N pulled out of the hug and walked to the group.</p><p>\u201cNo problem kids, have fun.\u201d Happy waved, the three teens waved back and walked to their group. Mr. Dell looked like he was already having a panic attack, he counted each student multiple times, making sure he got the same number each time. Mrs. Warren was calm and collected as she started at the other teacher.</p><p>\u201cALRIGHT STUDENTS!\u201d The crowd went silent</p><p>\u201cWHEN I CALL YOUR NAME YELL HERE!\u201d Mrs. Warren started naming off the students alphabetically\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPETER PARKER!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHERE!\u201d Peter replied lifting his hand</p><p>\u201cY/N STARK!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHERE!\u201d Y/N replied she heard her classmates start to whisper. Peter held Y/N\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cParker, you and Stark here dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N replied firmly. Peter didn\u2019t like her he likes MJ. To Y/N MJ was definitely better than her. MJ looked at the two, eyebrow raised. Y/N cleared her throat and dropped Peter\u2019s hand. Peter\u2019s smile fell, Y/N never let go of his hand. The group made their way through customs and boarded the plane. Peter grabbed Y/N\u2019s hand making her sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u00a0 this isn\u2019t my seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can see if they\u2019ll switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry but that\u2019s my seat.\u201d Y/N looked at MJ, she stood and moved out of the way</p><p>\u201cSorry MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d MJ placed her carry on overhead and sat in the seat. Y/N sat behind the two right next to Flash. Great. A 12-hour flight sitting next to Flash, maybe he won\u2019t be too bad today. Flash glanced over at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really did mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was sorry.\u201d Y/N looked at Flash, his dark brown eyes apologetic</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we start over?\u201d Y/N looked at the hand extended towards her, she grasped it and shook</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Flash smiled, the seat belt sign lit up and they buckled</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, this is your captain speaking. Our flight time will be of 12 hours and 40 minutes.\u00a0</p><p>At this time, make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position and that your seat belt is correctly fastened. Also, your portable electronic devices must be set to \u2018airplane\u2019 mode until an announcement is made upon arrival. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The cabin crew made their announcement next</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019d like to direct your attention to the television monitors. We will be showing our safety demonstration and would like the next few minutes of your complete attention.\u201d They watched the video, for Y/N this was nothing new she had been on planes so many times she lost count. 5 minutes after the video the pilot announced for the cabin crew to take their seats and prepare for taking off. Y/N hated the take off it made her sick to her stomach. The plane made its way gaining speed Y/N reached out and grabbed Flash\u2019s hand, she did this out of habit, she always held her dad\u2019s hand during take off and certain times it was Peter\u2019s hand. Peter turned around, looking between the seats. He saw Y/N\u2019s eyes closed shut, he looked down she was clutching Flash\u2019s hand. Peter\u2019s brows knitted, his stomach in knots, that was supposed to be him, she was supposed to be holding his hand, he was the one who should be comforting her not Flash. Peter scoffed and turned back around, crossing his arms, he knows he shouldn\u2019t feel jealous but he couldn\u2019t help it. Flash looked over at Y/N</p><p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cSorry I usually hold my dad\u2019s hand during taking off.\u201d Flash nodded, the plane finally leveled out and Y/N let go of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Y/N noticed Peter and MJ talking and laughing, she turned to her left and noticed Ned was talking to Betty. Y/N noticed that Betty definitely had a crush on Ned and Ned had a crush on Betty, she hoped the two of them would confess their feelings on this trip. Y/N turned back looking at her monitor, she scrolled through the movie options and decided to watch A Quiet Place, putting her headphones on, she ignored the world.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>3 hours later</p><p>Y/N was on her second movie when she heard the pilot speak</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned off the Fasten Seat Belt sign, and you may now move around the cabin. In a few moments, the flight attendants will be passing around the cabin to offer you hot or cold drinks, as well as breakfast/dinner/supper/a light meal/snack. Alcoholic drinks are also available at a nominal charge/with our compliments.\u201d\u00a0 The flight attendant reached Y/N and asked if she would like a snack, she grabbed water, chips, cookies and some fruit, she turned attention back to the movie.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>2 hours later</p><p>Y/N sighed, they had 7 hours to go and she was bored out of her mind, she stood and walked up and down the small hallway, she needed to stretch. Peter noticed Y/N walking up and down the cabin, he stood and followed behind her. Y/N turned and bumped straight into Peter.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me move over so you can get through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I just wanted to talk to you, you looked bored back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, watched 3 movies and gave up after that. Flash\u2019s uncomfortable around me still so no talking. You and MJ seem to be having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was talking to me about a book she\u2019s reading, plus she brought UNO so we\u2019ve been playing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me miss, sir, you can\u2019t block the hall.\u201dA flight attendant said</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Peter said, they walked back to their seats. Y/N sat down and Peter turned around in his seat.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brad?\u201d Brad looked forward and at Peter</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we switch seats for a bit?\u201d Peter glanced at you and back to Brad, Brad smiled</p><p>\u201cSure Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Peter and Brad switched, Peter was now sitting to your left right across from you.</p><p>\u201cYou left MJ all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Now I can actually get some peace and quiet and read.\u201d MJ chimed in</p><p>\u201cHeyyy,\u201d Peter whined, Mj placed a finger on her lips and making Peter shut up.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>8 hours into the flight</p><p>Y/N looked around, everyone around them had fallen asleep. Peter felt his eyes slowly start to close, Y/N smiled and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNight Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Y/N.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>The lights on the plane came on and everyone woke with a groan.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, as we start our descent, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position. Make sure your seat belt is securely fastened and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. Thank you.\u201d The Captain announced, Y/N stood and made her way to the bathroom before the seat belt sign came on. Everyone else followed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFlight attendants, prepare for landing please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCabin crew, please take your seats for landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have just been cleared to land at the Venice Marco Polo Airport. Please make sure one last time your seat belt is securely fastened. The flight attendants are currently passing around the cabin to make a final compliance check and pick up any remaining cups and glasses. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N felt the plane started it\u2019s decent and Peter reached for her hand, she looked at Peter he gave her a reassuring smile, his thumb drawing circles on her palm.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, welcome to Venice Marco Polo Airport. Local time is 9:30pm and the temperature is 70 degrees. For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the Captain turns off the Fasten Seat Belt sign. This will indicate that we have parked at the gate and that it is safe for you to move about. Please check around your seat for any personal belongings you may have brought on board with you and please use caution when opening the overhead bins, as heavy articles may have shifted around during the flight. If you require deplaning assistance, please remain in your seat until all other passengers have deplaned. One of our crew members will then be pleased to assist you. On behalf of the entire crew, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us on this trip and we are looking forward to seeing you on board again in the near future. Have a nice stay!\u201d</p><p>Everyone clapped as the plane came to a stop, they all stood to grab their carry-ons, Peter and Y/N were still holding hands as they walked off the plane to the baggage claim. Y/N rested her head onto Peter\u2019s shoulder, grabbing their luggage they walked to Mr. Dell and Mrs. Warren, the rest of the class followed. Mrs. Warren did roll call once again and once she noted everyone was there, they went outside and into the bus. No one was talking, just wanted to get to the hotel and sleep.\u00a0</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>They all piled off the bus, Mr. Dell giving out room keys and listing their roommates, Peter was rooming with Ned and MJ was rooming with Y/N. Peter and Ned\u2019s room was at the end of the hall to the right, while MJ\u2019s and Y/N\u2019s was to the right, they all said goodnight and entered their rooms. Y/N went straight to the restroom, brushed her teeth, changed and plopped on the bed. MJ did the same.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we have to be down there at 8. I just wanna have a lazy day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d MJ replied Y/N opened her carry on and pulled out Stitch.</p><p>\u201cNight MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Y/N.\u201d the room went dark and so did their worlds.</p><p><b>Tags:</b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mic7Wka-xzCrLKU1pBbb0PQ\">@ziggyspurplehaze</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpNDHuGb1om0DiJAPoJWECA\">@ghost-brocolli</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBYZXaBmOngftAlUtwDspg\">@a-sweet-little-fangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIh3QlH_jDwMU00n6iB2U9Q\">@imafreakingtaco</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM2SqDZ_e-Qwi-xn76tnhmQ\">@karlitabi-rrito</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/migFl6qyS_ElmNb7KIV7hzA\">@rexorangecounty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9HZpJnCKVuzrTEDDbeIJ2w\">@outsider-underwater</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\">@alisoncdariel</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsBbKFE4RTQxuIRv2X79XA\">@too-involved</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-mEsGpzinOJ73JoDtl-0mA\">@laurxn-robinson</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOroj3oz1Do0GJ7pk5TBMVQ\">@princessdancingonthesunshine</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqa5AUG1riofOAx5btyyOuw\">@eridanuswave</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpNUrTHrwzL7sPkzm6PMlHw\">@readixgkodie615</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYCJSiMzHZpcL663KFPwnPw\">@sltwins</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meC_KdLIMpr5o7nkSFQCP2Q\">@xjaelee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvsUDiSHXfMVFqNDVFrgSyg\">@peruvian-bae</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNCiTa-l8_9SUgSKKIUp-mQ\">@aestheticgaybish</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtJ40bwnGOBD9DlwSaWnAvg\">@gwil-myee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-NJH4jRBVgFUCthPZ5bRNg\">@editsbyjenny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mInmW01Oaqfo0V1sN8GlfAg\">@soniasalvatore1</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlaBaCfZTA6RVQKL1I3tV2Q\">@avnngrs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mySgn3xtGf7x7EUH7iJiG3Q\">@lifestragedy</a> </b></p>",

Phil smiled at him and Tony rolled his eyes. Phil wasn\u2019t about to get Y/N in trouble she was already scared as it is, Phil turned around nodding his head forward, Y/N turned around making her way towards the door when she bumped into a solid wall.

I larb you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI larb you too Aunt May.\u201d Peter smiled and hung up the phone</p><p>Y/N stood and made her way to her room, using the restroom to brush her teeth, comb her hair, Y/N changed into denim jeans and a plain grey shirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late!\u201d Pepper yelled</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming!\u201d Y/N yelled back, shoving her homework in her backpack and ran down the stairs</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Peter smiled</p><p>\u201cReady little stark? Kid?\u201d They nodded, Y/N ran to Pepper and kissed her cheek, she ran to Morgan and kissed her cheek</p><p>\u201cBye Pepper, bye Morgan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBye Mrs. Stark, bye Morgan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye kids, have fun at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBYE Y/N, BYE PETER!\u201d Morgan yelled and waved.</p><p>Peter, Y/N, and Happy exited the house, Peter hopped into the backseat and Y/N followed, Happy turned to his right expecting her to sit in the front but instead saw an empty seat</p><p>\u201cI see how it is a little Stark.\u201d Happy whispered and smiled looking at the two teenagers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWAIT! WAIT!\u201d Y/N turned around to see Morgan running towards the car, opening the door she looked down at her younger sister</p><p>\u201cHere..you\u2026go!\u201d Morgan said gasping to catch her breathe she handed Y/N a brown bag</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t open it until you\u2019re alone.\u201d Morgan smiled and ran back into the house, Y/N closed the door and looked at Peter</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she give you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea, she said to open it when I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show you after I open it.\u201d Peter nodded and smiled.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Peter and Y/N made it to school 20 minutes late, they tried sneaking past the office but failed now they are sitting in the principal\u2019s office, Y/N twirled her thumbs around, Peter didn\u2019t look nervous one bit he was used to this.</p><p>\"Miss. Stark and Mr. Parker, nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t that late.\u201d The principal sighed</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to let this slide because I understand that Miss Stark is going through a difficult time.\u201d Y/N met his eyes filled with pity. Y/N glared slightly, she hated being pitted on.</p><p>\u201cGet to class, both of you.\u201d Y/N stood along with Peter and went straight to the English class.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Lunch came around and Y/N smiled, chicken, mac and cheese, grapes and water. Y/N sat in the back remembering what Morgan gave her in the morning she opened her backpack and opened the brown bag. Y/N pulled out 12 Polaroid pictures that Morgan took in the morning, each a double. A little note fell from the pictures</p><p>One for you and one for Peter- Morgan</p><p>Y/N smiled and looked through each picture, one where Peter was laying on her chest arms wrapped around her waist a smile on his face, the next was of her laying on Peter\u2019s chest her arms wrapped around his waist a smile on her face, the next photo Peter was awake, kissing her forehead, Y/N blushed at the photo. When did he do that? She didn\u2019t even realize. The next photo was one of the two of them forehead to forehead, a smile on both their faces and slightly flushed. Moving to the next set it was of Peter moving a stray strand of hair away from Y/N\u2019s face and the last set was a photo that Happy took of Peter, Morgan and her, Morgan in Peter\u2019s arms, Peter made a funny face to make Morgan and Y/N laughed, Y/N smiled, they looked like a happy family. Y/N heard someone clear their throat quickly putting the photos away she looked up to see Flash staring at her.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what Penis-\u201d Y/N glared and Flash flinched</p><p>\u201cIs what Parker said true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he actually worked with Tony Stark and met all the other Avengers?\u201d Y/N lifted a brow</p><p>\u201cWhy so curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he is a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter doesn\u2019t lie. Yes, he worked with my father, aunts, and uncles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather? Tony Stark only has 1 kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you like one of those delusional fans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the fans who like to pretend they know the person. Let\u2019s be honest if you\u2019re Tony Stark\u2019s kid then I\u2019m Captain America\u2019s kid. If you are his kid, why have we never seen or heard of you? Was he embarrassed by you?\u201d Y/N felt tears prickle her eyes, was Tony embarrassed by her? No. He did it to protect her, he was Iron man she could have gotten hurt. Tony would never be embarrassed by her, he was proud of her.</p><p>\u201cI thought Parker was a liar, but you took first place.\u201d Y/N felt the tears rolled down her cheeks</p><p>\u201cFLASH!\u201d Flash turned towards the voice, Peter standing behind him, dropping his food, he raised his fist hitting Flash straight on the jaw, Flash fell to the ground clenching his jaw.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Parker!?\u201d Peter ignored him and sat next to Y/N, placing his hands on her cheeks he wiped her tears.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Y/N shook her head</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Grabbing her hand he pulled her out of the cafeteria, making his way to the roof of the school. Peter sat down, pulling her down with him. Y/N rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Peter.\u201d Peter turned to look at her</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry for? You have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you punched him, you might get suspended or expelled or worse you might not be able to go on the trip so you can forget about Spider-Man, my dad, Pepper, Morgan and me. You need to go on that trip to forget about everything.\u201d Y/N rambled lifting her head from his shoulder</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Peter caressed her face, forcing her to look at him</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to forget you. Ever. I\u2019m never going to forget Mr. Stark, Mrs. Stark or Morgan, you guys mean so much to me. Do you want to forget about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Y/N said confidently staring into his brown eyes, they twinkled when she said that.</p><p>\u201cI heard what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Y/N e/c eyes look down\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong you know. Mr. Stark loves you, he always mentioned you when I would visit the compound, how you managed to help build Veronica, an anti-gravity device,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one was a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he found out and you built my suit. Mr. Stark told me how proud he was when you finished the Iron Spider suit when I asked him about the suit he said \u201cKid, Y/N built it. I was worried at first because she started to be more and more like me, but she had this big smile on her face when working on your suit I couldn\u2019t stop her and when she finished it she ran to me screaming, yelling DAD DAD DAD I DID IT I DID IT. She dragged me into the lab and showed me the suit, her smile so wide, I\u2019m pretty sure her face hurt from how much she was smiling, my face hurt from smiling, I have never been so proud of her. I can just hope nothing happened to her.\u201d I just stared at him and thought he really loves her.\u201d Y/N felt the tears rolling down her cheeks once again. Peter smiled and wiped her tears</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d Y/N whispered</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Y/N calmed herself and grabbed her backpack, pulling out the brown bag.</p><p>\u201cReady to see?\u201d Peter nodded, Y/N pulled out the pictures and handed them to Peter. Peter looked at the polaroids sitting in his hands, his face turned red when he saw the sets. Peter never noticed how much of a couple they looked like, he loved the thought of it, did she even notice? Did she think about it? Peter saw the last set of photos, he was holding Morgan, his face scrunched up, tongue sticking out, Morgan and Y/N facing him laughing, he wanted to have a family with Y/N. Peter blushed at the thought, he let out a cough. Y/N smiled.</p><p>\u201cMorgan said one for me and one for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Peter chose his photos and handed the others back to Y/N. Peter pulled a folder from his bag and placed them in there. Y/N grabbed her bag and placed them in her notebook.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we head back?\u201d Peter sighed</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Come on.\u201d Y/N grabbed Peter\u2019s hand, standing and pulling him up with her. Y/N and Peter walked down the stairs hand in hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker, Miss Stark.\u201d They froze</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d Shit.\u00a0</p><p>Peter and Y/N sat in their chairs, shifting uncomfortably feeling May\u2019s stare and Pepper\u2019s stare burning holes into their faces. Flash sat on the right side of them with his father.</p><p>\u201cThank you all for coming, the reason you are all here is that Mr. Parker here hit Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d May said\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou hit someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I didn\u2019t do it on purpose or for no reason.\u201d May sighed, her fingers pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p>\u201cWe have a no violence policy in this school and I\u2019m considering taking Mr. Parker off the Europe trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d Y/N butted in</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Pepper warned her</p><p>\u201cBut Pepper, he can\u2019t do that. Flash was being a jerk to me and Peter protected me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO! You\u2019re seriously going to sit here and take the bully\u2019s side. Flash sat there and took me that I wasn\u2019t my dad\u2019s daughter and that I was nothing but disappointment and embarrassment to him.\u201d Y/N looked at Pepper, Pepper\u2019s blue eyes widened, reaching out placing her hand on Y/N\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cSweetie\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper, did dad ever feel that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, he never felt that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlash is this true?\u201d A deep rough voice spoke</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. There\u2019s no need to take Mr. Parker off the trip. I\u2019m willing to let this go since my son did decide to bully Miss Stark here. I\u2019m sorry Mrs. Stark. Apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Y/N looked at Flash</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d The group walked out of the office</p><p>\u201cY/N! PETER!\u201d Morgan ran towards the teens</p><p>\u201cHey, Morgan.\u201d They replied</p><p>\u201cPepper can we give Peter and May a ride home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Morgan stood between Peter and Y/N and held each of their hands, the three walked behind May and Pepper. Y/N looked over to Peter, they were in trouble.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Peter and May hopped out of the car before they reached the door Y/N hopped out of the car</p><p>\u201cMay,\u201d May turned around</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what happened wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know sweetie.\u201d May smiled</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on him.\u201d May laughed and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see at school tomorrow Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d Y/N waved, she got into the car and they drove off. Peter and May entered the building and into their apartment. Peter threw his backpack into his room and sat down on the couch, his leg bouncing up and down, fingers running through his hair. He heard May sigh and felt her sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted to protect her, but next time try not to hit him. Same rules apply, no patrolling, no going out, no TV and no phone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMay, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Peter.\u201d May smiled at her nephew</p><p>\u201cGood for you though, protecting your crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-What? I I don\u2019t have a crush on Y/N.\u201d May raised a brow</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter\u2019s blood rushed to his face</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d Peter asked shyly</p><p>\u201cUmm, just a tad.\u201d Peter groaned</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she likes me in that way anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Peter ran his fingers through his hair again</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just amazing, you know. She\u2019s insanely smart, funny, gentle, understanding and beautiful. And her smile May, God her smile, it lights up my world, it makes my heart race every time. I would do anything to keep that smile on her face. She makes me feel calm, safe and she feels like home like it\u2019s only the two of us and there\u2019s no evil in the world. She just takes my breath away.\u201d May stared at Peter, his face red, a shy smile on his face, brown eyes twinkled and filled with love. May knew that he watched her like she had the stars in her hands and soft petals at her feet, he wanted to wrap her in his arms and never let go. May smiled at Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t like me? I don\u2019t want to ruin the friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a chance, Peter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll tell her on the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for listening to me May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to know about my nephew\u2019s crush. Y/N and Peter sitting in a tree,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay,\u201d Peter groaned</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, now go do homework, while I go make dinner and by make I mean do you want Chinese food?\u201d Peter laughed</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks May.\u201d Peter stood heading to his room</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Oh, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone. Suit.\u201d Peter inwardly groaned, he hopped she forgot about that, pulling his phone out, going into his room pulling his suit out and handing the items to May. Peter went back into his room and started on his homework.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>By the time the Starks made it home, it was dark out. Happy stopped at a fast food place and got them food. The trio said goodbye to Happy and made their way into the house. Y/N walked up the stairs throwing her backpack into the room and made her way back down the stairs, Y/N saw Pepper sitting on the couch, Morgan on the floor coloring in her book. Y/N sat next to Pepper.</p><p>\u201cPepper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t dad want anyone to know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was worried. Scared that something might happen to you.\u201d Y/N nodded, she remembered when her dad told her his worries, but she wanted to make sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he said that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel like this wouldn\u2019t have happened if you were still homeschooled, it\u2019s only been two days and you were already sent to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d Pepper laughed</p><p>\u201cWhat? Causing trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike father, like daughter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pepper, for everything.\u201d Pepper pulled Y/N into a hug</p><p>\u201cI wanna hug too.\u201d Morgan stood pouting</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Y/N opened her arm and Morgan joined the hug.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>1 day before the trip</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you taking your suit?\u201d Peter looked at Y/N\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just planning on relaxing.\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cSo, does MJ know yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Peter replied reaching for the bag of sour patches</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Y/N reached for a chocolate bar filled with almonds, Peter got other snacks for Ned and MJ</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I agreed to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed and MJ said it was a crime that you haven\u2019t seen Star Wars yet, so they said movie night. Plus we can all just carpool tomorrow to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sleepover, I only gave in because you gave me the puppy eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d Peter and Y/N walked to the register, she paid for the things. Peter and Y/N walked back towards his apartment, entering the apartment, she set the bag of snacks on the table\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi May, I brought you some chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYEAH?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCAN YOU COME AND HELP ME?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCOMING.\u201d Y/N walked into Peter\u2019s room, he was struggling with the blankets and pillows, rushing to him she grabbed a handful of pillows and a blanket. Y/N walked back into the living room, setting the stuff down on the couch</p><p>\u201cPeter is all this really necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He huffed out placing the blankets down. Peter turned and looked at the coffee table sitting in the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere should I move this?\u201d Peter mumbled</p><p>\u201cPeter just move it against the wall,\u201d May responded, Peter nodded easily picking up the table and moving it against the table, Y/N started setting the blankets down, the fluffiest ones on the bottom with the rest on top, placing the big fluffy pillows on top, she stepped back to admire her work, smiling she was satisfied. Peter stood next to Y/N, wrapping his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGood job Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Should we set up the screen now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe in a bit.\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cDo you guys want pizza for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Y/N and Peter replied</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll order now.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Peter laid on the edge of the blankets, Y/N next to him, MJ sat next to her and Ned next to MJ, all of them dressed in their PJs. They were about halfway through the movie, an empty pizza box in front of them along with wrappers from multiple snacks. Y/N could feel her eyes become heavy, Peter glanced at her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cGetting sleepy?\u201d Peter whispered in her ear</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re almost there, you can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Y/N shook her head and continued to watch the movie, the credits rolled on the screen</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ned asked</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was good. Should we put on another movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord of the rings?\u201d Ned asked MJ and Peter agreed. Y/N\u2019s eyes widened</p><p>\u201cUmmm, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Peter said</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen that either, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, what have you seen?\u201d MJ asked</p><p>\u201cUmm fandom wise just those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Peter go put it on.\u201d Peter stood and put the movie on, he snuggled back next to Y/N.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clean up before it starts.\u201d Y/N stood picking up the empty box and the wrappers, she stood in the kitchen throwing away the wrappers, folding the box and placing it on the counter. Y/N walked towards the blankets but stopped, MJ had moved over next to Peter, the two of them in a deep conversation, occasionally Ned would chime in. Y/N looked away and went into the restroom, sighing she grabbed her toothbrush and brushed her teeth. Y/N finished opening the door she made her way back to the blankets the movie had already started, she looked at Peter and MJ from the looks of it she had no plans in moving, Y/N sat next to Ned and quietly watched the movie. Y/N slowly started to become annoyed, she could hear their whispered and giggles every once in a while, they weren\u2019t including her in their conversation. Why should they? Y/N was an outcast in their group, they had been friends for a while now. Y/N just laid down and tried to ignore them, turning on her side she closed her eyes and fell asleep. Peter glanced at Y/N, he noticed she rolled her eyes, biting the inside of her cheek and eyes narrowed she was annoyed. Peter turned his attention back to MJ, why was she annoyed? Peter glanced back at Y/N, her back facing them, Ned noticed Peter\u2019s gaze and looked at Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe fell asleep.\u201d Peter chuckled</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Peter looked at the clock 11:15pm</p><p>\u201cWe should sleep too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d MJ and Ned agreed, the three rose carefully and made their way to the bathroom to brush their teeth. Ned and MJ finished and went back, Peter used the bathroom and walked back to the blankets, Ned had laid back down next to Y/N, he wanted to sleep next to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on Peter, we don\u2019t have all night.\u201d Peter looked at MJ and laid down next to her, Peter dimmed the lights</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d MJ and Ned replied, then they entered the world of darkness.</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>3:30am</p><p>Y/N rolled onto her back and groaned, slowly opening her eyes, she blinked. Why was it so dark? It\u2019s too dark in here, she couldn\u2019t see anything. Y/N sat up, back against the couch, reaching for her phone she turned on the flashlight, careful not to wake the others up, she stood and made her way into the bathroom. Peter heard the door close, he rolled over and noticed Y/N was missing from her spot, Peter sat up and sat on the couch. Y/N came out of the bathroom and squealed when she noticed a figure on the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d Peter whispered, Y/N relaxed and sat next to Peter</p><p>\u201cSorry for scaring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my senses kicked in and woke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooo, I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way, but it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to go back to sleep?\u201d Y/N asked</p><p>\u201cNightmare.\u201d Y/N nodded understanding</p><p>\u201cDo you think they have nightmares?\u201d Y/N asked cocking her head towards Ned and MJ</p><p>\u201cProbably normal ones, not about the snap or you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna talk about it?\u201d Y/N asked</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 We weren\u2019t able to stop Thanos and I turned around you\u2026 You were disappearing and Mr. Stark was lying on the floor, coughing up blood. I couldn\u2019t save you both.\u201d Peter felt Y/N\u2019s hand slip into his, she squeezed his hand</p><p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Peter said, looking at Y/N. Y/N scooted to the end of the couch and laid down, she opened her arms and patted her chest. Peter smiled and climbed into her arms, he snuggled against her neck, her fingers running through his curled brown hair.</p><p>\u201cNight Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Y/N woke up to the sound of a camera clicking. Not again, opening her eyes she saw me standing there taking pictures of the two teens</p><p>\u201cSorry, you just looked so adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c7. You guys should start getting up and ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d May turned and walked into the kitchen, Y/N looked down at Peter, running her fingers through his hair and whispering</p><p>\u201cPeter. Peter. Get up.\u201d Peter moaned and tightened his grip</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna.\u201d Y/N laughed</p><p>\u201cPeter, get up, we have to get ready and eat.\u201d MJ looked at Y/N and Peter on the couch</p><p>\u201cMorning MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning everybody,\u201d Ned said brightly</p><p>\u201cGood morning Ned.\u201d MJ and Y/N replied Peter moaned again</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep\u2026 five more minutes.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes</p><p>\u201cPete, get up. I\u2019m pretty sure Y/N wants to go brush her teeth and use the bathroom.\u201d Ned said</p><p>\u201cUghh, too comfy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, if you don\u2019t get up, I will use the secret weapon.\u201d Peter\u2019s head shot up, her stared int Y/N e/c eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me, Parker.\u201d Peter narrowed his eyes. Y/N lifted her hands, wiggling her fingers.</p><p>\u201cFine. Fine. I\u2019m up.\u201d Peter lifted himself from Y/N, she sat up and smiled</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter grumbled. Y/N made her way into Peter\u2019s room and grabbed her little bag filled with today\u2019s clothing. Y/N walked back into the living asking if anyone needed the restroom because she was going to shower, everyone replied no and Y/N went to shower.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>Happy was not happy driving a car full of teenagers to the airport, the music was blasting, the boys were singing off-key and dancing around, the girls singing on key and just stook to bobbing their heads from side to side. Happy groaned, New York traffic was the worst, he wished they could just zoom through and he could finally have some peace and quiet. Y/N turned and looked at Happy, she lowered the music</p><p>\u201cSorry uncle Happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries Little Stark, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re smiling and having fun.\u201d Y/N smiled</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try and keep it down.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0 Happy pulled into the parking lot, helping the kids unload their luggage, he followed behind the group of teens, making sure they didn\u2019t get hurt or lost. Y/N saw the group of students along with Mr. Dell and Mrs. Warren. Y/N turned back to Happy</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in 2 weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in 2 weeks, little Stark.\u201d Y/N smiled, Happy opened his arms and she jumped into them.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing us Happy,\u201d Peter said</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Hogan.\u201d MJ and Ned chimed in. Y/N pulled out of the hug and walked to the group.</p><p>\u201cNo problem kids, have fun.\u201d Happy waved, the three teens waved back and walked to their group. Mr. Dell looked like he was already having a panic attack, he counted each student multiple times, making sure he got the same number each time. Mrs. Warren was calm and collected as she started at the other teacher.</p><p>\u201cALRIGHT STUDENTS!\u201d The crowd went silent</p><p>\u201cWHEN I CALL YOUR NAME YELL HERE!\u201d Mrs. Warren started naming off the students alphabetically\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPETER PARKER!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHERE!\u201d Peter replied lifting his hand</p><p>\u201cY/N STARK!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHERE!\u201d Y/N replied she heard her classmates start to whisper. Peter held Y/N\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cParker, you and Stark here dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N replied firmly. Peter didn\u2019t like her he likes MJ. To Y/N MJ was definitely better than her. MJ looked at the two, eyebrow raised. Y/N cleared her throat and dropped Peter\u2019s hand. Peter\u2019s smile fell, Y/N never let go of his hand. The group made their way through customs and boarded the plane. Peter grabbed Y/N\u2019s hand making her sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u00a0 this isn\u2019t my seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can see if they\u2019ll switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry but that\u2019s my seat.\u201d Y/N looked at MJ, she stood and moved out of the way</p><p>\u201cSorry MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d MJ placed her carry on overhead and sat in the seat. Y/N sat behind the two right next to Flash. Great. A 12-hour flight sitting next to Flash, maybe he won\u2019t be too bad today. Flash glanced over at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really did mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was sorry.\u201d Y/N looked at Flash, his dark brown eyes apologetic</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we start over?\u201d Y/N looked at the hand extended towards her, she grasped it and shook</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Flash smiled, the seat belt sign lit up and they buckled</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, this is your captain speaking. Our flight time will be of 12 hours and 40 minutes.\u00a0</p><p>At this time, make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position and that your seat belt is correctly fastened. Also, your portable electronic devices must be set to \u2018airplane\u2019 mode until an announcement is made upon arrival. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The cabin crew made their announcement next</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019d like to direct your attention to the television monitors. We will be showing our safety demonstration and would like the next few minutes of your complete attention.\u201d They watched the video, for Y/N this was nothing new she had been on planes so many times she lost count. 5 minutes after the video the pilot announced for the cabin crew to take their seats and prepare for taking off. Y/N hated the take off it made her sick to her stomach. The plane made its way gaining speed Y/N reached out and grabbed Flash\u2019s hand, she did this out of habit, she always held her dad\u2019s hand during take off and certain times it was Peter\u2019s hand. Peter turned around, looking between the seats. He saw Y/N\u2019s eyes closed shut, he looked down she was clutching Flash\u2019s hand. Peter\u2019s brows knitted, his stomach in knots, that was supposed to be him, she was supposed to be holding his hand, he was the one who should be comforting her not Flash. Peter scoffed and turned back around, crossing his arms, he knows he shouldn\u2019t feel jealous but he couldn\u2019t help it. Flash looked over at Y/N</p><p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cSorry I usually hold my dad\u2019s hand during taking off.\u201d Flash nodded, the plane finally leveled out and Y/N let go of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Y/N noticed Peter and MJ talking and laughing, she turned to her left and noticed Ned was talking to Betty. Y/N noticed that Betty definitely had a crush on Ned and Ned had a crush on Betty, she hoped the two of them would confess their feelings on this trip. Y/N turned back looking at her monitor, she scrolled through the movie options and decided to watch A Quiet Place, putting her headphones on, she ignored the world.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>3 hours later</p><p>Y/N was on her second movie when she heard the pilot speak</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned off the Fasten Seat Belt sign, and you may now move around the cabin. In a few moments, the flight attendants will be passing around the cabin to offer you hot or cold drinks, as well as breakfast/dinner/supper/a light meal/snack. Alcoholic drinks are also available at a nominal charge/with our compliments.\u201d\u00a0 The flight attendant reached Y/N and asked if she would like a snack, she grabbed water, chips, cookies and some fruit, she turned attention back to the movie.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>2 hours later</p><p>Y/N sighed, they had 7 hours to go and she was bored out of her mind, she stood and walked up and down the small hallway, she needed to stretch. Peter noticed Y/N walking up and down the cabin, he stood and followed behind her. Y/N turned and bumped straight into Peter.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me move over so you can get through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I just wanted to talk to you, you looked bored back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, watched 3 movies and gave up after that. Flash\u2019s uncomfortable around me still so no talking. You and MJ seem to be having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was talking to me about a book she\u2019s reading, plus she brought UNO so we\u2019ve been playing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me miss, sir, you can\u2019t block the hall.\u201dA flight attendant said</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Peter said, they walked back to their seats. Y/N sat down and Peter turned around in his seat.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brad?\u201d Brad looked forward and at Peter</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we switch seats for a bit?\u201d Peter glanced at you and back to Brad, Brad smiled</p><p>\u201cSure Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Peter and Brad switched, Peter was now sitting to your left right across from you.</p><p>\u201cYou left MJ all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Now I can actually get some peace and quiet and read.\u201d MJ chimed in</p><p>\u201cHeyyy,\u201d Peter whined, Mj placed a finger on her lips and making Peter shut up.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>8 hours into the flight</p><p>Y/N looked around, everyone around them had fallen asleep. Peter felt his eyes slowly start to close, Y/N smiled and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNight Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The lights on the plane came on and everyone woke with a groan.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, as we start our descent, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position. Make sure your seat belt is securely fastened and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. Thank you.\u201d The Captain announced, Y/N stood and made her way to the bathroom before the seat belt sign came on. Everyone else followed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFlight attendants, prepare for landing please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCabin crew, please take your seats for landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have just been cleared to land at the Venice Marco Polo Airport. Please make sure one last time your seat belt is securely fastened. The flight attendants are currently passing around the cabin to make a final compliance check and pick up any remaining cups and glasses. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N felt the plane started it\u2019s decent and Peter reached for her hand, she looked at Peter he gave her a reassuring smile, his thumb drawing circles on her palm.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, welcome to Venice Marco Polo Airport. Local time is 9:30pm and the temperature is 70 degrees. For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the Captain turns off the Fasten Seat Belt sign. This will indicate that we have parked at the gate and that it is safe for you to move about. Please check around your seat for any personal belongings you may have brought on board with you and please use caution when opening the overhead bins, as heavy articles may have shifted around during the flight. If you require deplaning assistance, please remain in your seat until all other passengers have deplaned. One of our crew members will then be pleased to assist you. On behalf of the entire crew, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us on this trip and we are looking forward to seeing you on board again in the near future. Have a nice stay!\u201d</p><p>Everyone clapped as the plane came to a stop, they all stood to grab their carry-ons, Peter and Y/N were still holding hands as they walked off the plane to the baggage claim. Y/N rested her head onto Peter\u2019s shoulder, grabbing their luggage they walked to Mr. Dell and Mrs. Warren, the rest of the class followed. Mrs. Warren did roll call once again and once she noted everyone was there, they went outside and into the bus. No one was talking, just wanted to get to the hotel and sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>They all piled off the bus, Mr. Dell giving out room keys and listing their roommates, Peter was rooming with Ned and MJ was rooming with Y/N. Peter and Ned\u2019s room was at the end of the hall to the right, while MJ\u2019s and Y/N\u2019s was to the right, they all said goodnight and entered their rooms. Y/N went straight to the restroom, brushed her teeth, changed and plopped on the bed. MJ did the same.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we have to be down there at 8. I just wanna have a lazy day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d MJ replied Y/N opened her carry on and pulled out Stitch.</p><p>\u201cNight MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Y/N.\u201d the room went dark and so did their worlds.</p><p><b>Tags:</b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mic7Wka-xzCrLKU1pBbb0PQ\">@ziggyspurplehaze</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpNDHuGb1om0DiJAPoJWECA\">@ghost-brocolli</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBYZXaBmOngftAlUtwDspg\">@a-sweet-little-fangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIh3QlH_jDwMU00n6iB2U9Q\">@imafreakingtaco</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM2SqDZ_e-Qwi-xn76tnhmQ\">@karlitabi-rrito</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/migFl6qyS_ElmNb7KIV7hzA\">@rexorangecounty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9HZpJnCKVuzrTEDDbeIJ2w\">@outsider-underwater</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\">@alisoncdariel</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsBbKFE4RTQxuIRv2X79XA\">@too-involved</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-mEsGpzinOJ73JoDtl-0mA\">@laurxn-robinson</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOroj3oz1Do0GJ7pk5TBMVQ\">@princessdancingonthesunshine</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqa5AUG1riofOAx5btyyOuw\">@eridanuswave</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpNUrTHrwzL7sPkzm6PMlHw\">@readixgkodie615</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYCJSiMzHZpcL663KFPwnPw\">@sltwins</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meC_KdLIMpr5o7nkSFQCP2Q\">@xjaelee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvsUDiSHXfMVFqNDVFrgSyg\">@peruvian-bae</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNCiTa-l8_9SUgSKKIUp-mQ\">@aestheticgaybish</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtJ40bwnGOBD9DlwSaWnAvg\">@gwil-myee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-NJH4jRBVgFUCthPZ5bRNg\">@editsbyjenny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mInmW01Oaqfo0V1sN8GlfAg\">@soniasalvatore1</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlaBaCfZTA6RVQKL1I3tV2Q\">@avnngrs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mySgn3xtGf7x7EUH7iJiG3Q\">@lifestragedy</a> </b></p>",

Y/N was just as nervous as Peter, this would be the first time they slept together, well they\u2019ve slept together but not on the same bed. Peter always slept on the floor surrounded by blankets and pillows while Y/N slept in her bed. Y/N\u2019s heartbeat echoed in her ears, it was beating fast it was too loud, she was nervous Peter could hear it, but all Peter could hear was the sound of his own heart. Peter climbed into the bed and laid down next to Y/N.</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y can you lower the lights the 15%.\u201d The lights dimmed, even more, a slight glow still illuminated the room. Y/N was scared of the dark, bad things happened in the dark. Y/N rolled on her side, staring at the side of Peter\u2019s face, Peter rolled over to face Y/N, he smiled at her, reaching out, he moved the start strand of her hair away from her face, Y/N smiled</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cGood night Peter.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cGood night Y/N.\"\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i><b>6:30am</b></i></p><p>Peter groaned cuddling into Y/N\u2019s neck, even more, his hair tickling Y\u2019N\u2019s nose, it twitched. They both haven\u2019t slept so peacefully in weeks, Peter\u2019s arms wrapped right around Y/N bringing her peace she\u2019s never known before, a calming of the storms in her heart. Peter believes it\u2019s her that gives him hope for the future. In each other\u2019s embrace, they start to believe that there is nothing out there to fear, that all there is, is sunshine. Peter groaned once again once he heard giggling and saw a faded flash from his closed eyes he slowly opened his eyes to see Morgan standing in front of them with a Polaroid camera in hand. Peter sat up slightly, Morgan\u2019s brown eyes widened she ran away while giggling. Y/N groaned and she felt Peter shift stretching her arm out wrapping it around Peter\u2019s waist he laid back down and ran his fingers through her h/c hair, Peter smiled looking down at her, her chest rising and falling, her eyelids slightly fluttering, mouth slightly open, drool making its way down her cheek. Peter laughed, Y/N groaned feeling Peter\u2019s chest vibrate</p><p>\u201c5 more minutes..\u201d Y/N mumbled against his chest</p><p>\u201cAs much as I want that, it\u2019s almost 7.\u201d Y/N shot up getting slightly light headed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Peter rolled over grabbing his phone showing her the time. 6:40am\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u201cOh my god! We\u2019re going to be late!\u201d Peter leaned on his side staring at Y/N looking around frantically then she stopped realizing what she probably looked like.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! Peter close your eyes.\u201d Y/N squealed placing her hand over his eyes. Peter laughed</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Grabbing her hand and pulling it down, Y/N raced to place her other hand over his eyes</p><p>\u201cBecause I probably look like a mess.\u201d Peter moved her hand once again and looked into her e/c eyes</p><p>\u201cYou look perfect,\u201d he whispered. Y/N felt her face flush, Peter felt the same, his face bright red then a flash disrupted them, turning their heads to see Morgan standing there with a big smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cMama told me to come and get you guys because breakfast is ready,\u201d and with that Morgan ran off into the house. Y/N shook her head standing up Peter followed her movements, grabbing his backpack and picking up the blanket</p><p>\u201cI can take that Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s fine, just lead the way.\u201d Peter followed Y/N into the house, their noses greeted with the smell of eggs, bacon, and toast. Pepper stood in front of the island arms across her chest, eyebrows raised. Y/N flinched she had a whole lot of explaining to do.</p><p>\u201cGood morning Pepper.\u201d Y/N whispered as she sat on the chair</p><p>\u201cGood morning Mrs. Stark,\u201d Peter mumbled with his head down sitting next to Y/N</p><p>\u201cGood Morning Y/N, Peter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood morning Y/N, Peter!\u201d Morgan yelled out sitting on the other side of Y/N</p><p>\u201cMorning Morgan.\u201d The two teens replied</p><p>\u201cSo, do one of you want to talk or\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Pepper. I couldn\u2019t sleep so I went outside and Peter came, we were talking and fell asleep.\u201d\u00a0 Pepper sighed</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind the two of you being together but I prefer that you didn\u2019t sneak around,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to disrespect you, Mrs. Stark.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlso no more sleepovers, I mean if you do it\u2019ll be in separate rooms, doors open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d Y/N asked munching on her toast</p><p>\u201cA bit, but I\u2019d rather you tell me that you two are hanging out than sneaking around.\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Pepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mrs. Stark.\u201d Pepper smiled</p><p>\u201cAlright, finish breakfast and go get ready still got to go to school.\u201d The two teens nodded, Peter stood and headed to the restroom</p><p>\u201cOh and Peter,\u201d Peter turned and looked at Pepper</p><p>\u201cCall your Aunt, she called here last night worried.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes widened, he nodded and went into the restroom. Peter frantically changed into his clothes grabbing his phone pressing the number one, he heard the phone ring.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt May? I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t call, Y/N messaged me and I came over, we started talking and we fell asleep. I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t mean to make you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA text would have been nice Peter, I called everywhere. I called Ned, MJ, hospitals and then when I called Pepper, she said that you had gone over and fell asleep. Do you know how worried I was? I thought something bad happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Aunt May\u2026\u201d Peter whispered out, he heard her sigh</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Peter, just please next time call me or text me. Also, you\u2019re grounded for a week, no patrolling, no TV and no going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Peter inwardly groaned, grounded a week and a half before the vacation, well at least she didn\u2019t say she couldn\u2019t go.</p><p>\u201cGet going, you\u2019re going to be late for school. I larb you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI larb you too Aunt May.\u201d Peter smiled and hung up the phone</p><p>Y/N stood and made her way to her room, using the restroom to brush her teeth, comb her hair, Y/N changed into denim jeans and a plain grey shirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late!\u201d Pepper yelled</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming!\u201d Y/N yelled back, shoving her homework in her backpack and ran down the stairs</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Peter smiled</p><p>\u201cReady little stark? Kid?\u201d They nodded, Y/N ran to Pepper and kissed her cheek, she ran to Morgan and kissed her cheek</p><p>\u201cBye Pepper, bye Morgan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBye Mrs. Stark, bye Morgan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye kids, have fun at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBYE Y/N, BYE PETER!\u201d Morgan yelled and waved.</p><p>Peter, Y/N, and Happy exited the house, Peter hopped into the backseat and Y/N followed, Happy turned to his right expecting her to sit in the front but instead saw an empty seat</p><p>\u201cI see how it is a little Stark.\u201d Happy whispered and smiled looking at the two teenagers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWAIT! WAIT!\u201d Y/N turned around to see Morgan running towards the car, opening the door she looked down at her younger sister</p><p>\u201cHere..you\u2026go!\u201d Morgan said gasping to catch her breathe she handed Y/N a brown bag</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t open it until you\u2019re alone.\u201d Morgan smiled and ran back into the house, Y/N closed the door and looked at Peter</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she give you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea, she said to open it when I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show you after I open it.\u201d Peter nodded and smiled.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Peter and Y/N made it to school 20 minutes late, they tried sneaking past the office but failed now they are sitting in the principal\u2019s office, Y/N twirled her thumbs around, Peter didn\u2019t look nervous one bit he was used to this.</p><p>\"Miss. Stark and Mr. Parker, nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t that late.\u201d The principal sighed</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to let this slide because I understand that Miss Stark is going through a difficult time.\u201d Y/N met his eyes filled with pity. Y/N glared slightly, she hated being pitted on.</p><p>\u201cGet to class, both of you.\u201d Y/N stood along with Peter and went straight to the English class.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Lunch came around and Y/N smiled, chicken, mac and cheese, grapes and water. Y/N sat in the back remembering what Morgan gave her in the morning she opened her backpack and opened the brown bag. Y/N pulled out 12 Polaroid pictures that Morgan took in the morning, each a double. A little note fell from the pictures</p><p>One for you and one for Peter- Morgan</p><p>Y/N smiled and looked through each picture, one where Peter was laying on her chest arms wrapped around her waist a smile on his face, the next was of her laying on Peter\u2019s chest her arms wrapped around his waist a smile on her face, the next photo Peter was awake, kissing her forehead, Y/N blushed at the photo. When did he do that? She didn\u2019t even realize. The next photo was one of the two of them forehead to forehead, a smile on both their faces and slightly flushed. Moving to the next set it was of Peter moving a stray strand of hair away from Y/N\u2019s face and the last set was a photo that Happy took of Peter, Morgan and her, Morgan in Peter\u2019s arms, Peter made a funny face to make Morgan and Y/N laughed, Y/N smiled, they looked like a happy family. Y/N heard someone clear their throat quickly putting the photos away she looked up to see Flash staring at her.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what Penis-\u201d Y/N glared and Flash flinched</p><p>\u201cIs what Parker said true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he actually worked with Tony Stark and met all the other Avengers?\u201d Y/N lifted a brow</p><p>\u201cWhy so curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he is a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter doesn\u2019t lie. Yes, he worked with my father, aunts, and uncles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather? Tony Stark only has 1 kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you like one of those delusional fans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the fans who like to pretend they know the person. Let\u2019s be honest if you\u2019re Tony Stark\u2019s kid then I\u2019m Captain America\u2019s kid. If you are his kid, why have we never seen or heard of you? Was he embarrassed by you?\u201d Y/N felt tears prickle her eyes, was Tony embarrassed by her? No. He did it to protect her, he was Iron man she could have gotten hurt. Tony would never be embarrassed by her, he was proud of her.</p><p>\u201cI thought Parker was a liar, but you took first place.\u201d Y/N felt the tears rolled down her cheeks</p><p>\u201cFLASH!\u201d Flash turned towards the voice, Peter standing behind him, dropping his food, he raised his fist hitting Flash straight on the jaw, Flash fell to the ground clenching his jaw.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Parker!?\u201d Peter ignored him and sat next to Y/N, placing his hands on her cheeks he wiped her tears.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Y/N shook her head</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Grabbing her hand he pulled her out of the cafeteria, making his way to the roof of the school. Peter sat down, pulling her down with him. Y/N rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Peter.\u201d Peter turned to look at her</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry for? You have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you punched him, you might get suspended or expelled or worse you might not be able to go on the trip so you can forget about Spider-Man, my dad, Pepper, Morgan and me. You need to go on that trip to forget about everything.\u201d Y/N rambled lifting her head from his shoulder</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Peter caressed her face, forcing her to look at him</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to forget you. Ever. I\u2019m never going to forget Mr. Stark, Mrs. Stark or Morgan, you guys mean so much to me. Do you want to forget about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Y/N said confidently staring into his brown eyes, they twinkled when she said that.</p><p>\u201cI heard what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Y/N e/c eyes look down\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong you know. Mr. Stark loves you, he always mentioned you when I would visit the compound, how you managed to help build Veronica, an anti-gravity device,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one was a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he found out and you built my suit. Mr. Stark told me how proud he was when you finished the Iron Spider suit when I asked him about the suit he said \u201cKid, Y/N built it. I was worried at first because she started to be more and more like me, but she had this big smile on her face when working on your suit I couldn\u2019t stop her and when she finished it she ran to me screaming, yelling DAD DAD DAD I DID IT I DID IT. She dragged me into the lab and showed me the suit, her smile so wide, I\u2019m pretty sure her face hurt from how much she was smiling, my face hurt from smiling, I have never been so proud of her. I can just hope nothing happened to her.\u201d I just stared at him and thought he really loves her.\u201d Y/N felt the tears rolling down her cheeks once again. Peter smiled and wiped her tears</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d Y/N whispered</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Y/N calmed herself and grabbed her backpack, pulling out the brown bag.</p><p>\u201cReady to see?\u201d Peter nodded, Y/N pulled out the pictures and handed them to Peter. Peter looked at the polaroids sitting in his hands, his face turned red when he saw the sets. Peter never noticed how much of a couple they looked like, he loved the thought of it, did she even notice? Did she think about it? Peter saw the last set of photos, he was holding Morgan, his face scrunched up, tongue sticking out, Morgan and Y/N facing him laughing, he wanted to have a family with Y/N. Peter blushed at the thought, he let out a cough. Y/N smiled.</p><p>\u201cMorgan said one for me and one for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Peter chose his photos and handed the others back to Y/N. Peter pulled a folder from his bag and placed them in there. Y/N grabbed her bag and placed them in her notebook.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we head back?\u201d Peter sighed</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Come on.\u201d Y/N grabbed Peter\u2019s hand, standing and pulling him up with her. Y/N and Peter walked down the stairs hand in hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker, Miss Stark.\u201d They froze</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d Shit.\u00a0</p><p>Peter and Y/N sat in their chairs, shifting uncomfortably feeling May\u2019s stare and Pepper\u2019s stare burning holes into their faces. Flash sat on the right side of them with his father.</p><p>\u201cThank you all for coming, the reason you are all here is that Mr. Parker here hit Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d May said\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou hit someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I didn\u2019t do it on purpose or for no reason.\u201d May sighed, her fingers pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p>\u201cWe have a no violence policy in this school and I\u2019m considering taking Mr. Parker off the Europe trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d Y/N butted in</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Pepper warned her</p><p>\u201cBut Pepper, he can\u2019t do that. Flash was being a jerk to me and Peter protected me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO! You\u2019re seriously going to sit here and take the bully\u2019s side. Flash sat there and took me that I wasn\u2019t my dad\u2019s daughter and that I was nothing but disappointment and embarrassment to him.\u201d Y/N looked at Pepper, Pepper\u2019s blue eyes widened, reaching out placing her hand on Y/N\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cSweetie\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper, did dad ever feel that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, he never felt that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlash is this true?\u201d A deep rough voice spoke</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. There\u2019s no need to take Mr. Parker off the trip. I\u2019m willing to let this go since my son did decide to bully Miss Stark here. I\u2019m sorry Mrs. Stark. Apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Y/N looked at Flash</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d The group walked out of the office</p><p>\u201cY/N! PETER!\u201d Morgan ran towards the teens</p><p>\u201cHey, Morgan.\u201d They replied</p><p>\u201cPepper can we give Peter and May a ride home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Morgan stood between Peter and Y/N and held each of their hands, the three walked behind May and Pepper. Y/N looked over to Peter, they were in trouble.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Peter and May hopped out of the car before they reached the door Y/N hopped out of the car</p><p>\u201cMay,\u201d May turned around</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what happened wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know sweetie.\u201d May smiled</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on him.\u201d May laughed and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see at school tomorrow Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d Y/N waved, she got into the car and they drove off. Peter and May entered the building and into their apartment. Peter threw his backpack into his room and sat down on the couch, his leg bouncing up and down, fingers running through his hair. He heard May sigh and felt her sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted to protect her, but next time try not to hit him. Same rules apply, no patrolling, no going out, no TV and no phone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMay, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Peter.\u201d May smiled at her nephew</p><p>\u201cGood for you though, protecting your crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-What? I I don\u2019t have a crush on Y/N.\u201d May raised a brow</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter\u2019s blood rushed to his face</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d Peter asked shyly</p><p>\u201cUmm, just a tad.\u201d Peter groaned</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she likes me in that way anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Peter ran his fingers through his hair again</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just amazing, you know. She\u2019s insanely smart, funny, gentle, understanding and beautiful. And her smile May, God her smile, it lights up my world, it makes my heart race every time. I would do anything to keep that smile on her face. She makes me feel calm, safe and she feels like home like it\u2019s only the two of us and there\u2019s no evil in the world. She just takes my breath away.\u201d May stared at Peter, his face red, a shy smile on his face, brown eyes twinkled and filled with love. May knew that he watched her like she had the stars in her hands and soft petals at her feet, he wanted to wrap her in his arms and never let go. May smiled at Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t like me? I don\u2019t want to ruin the friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a chance, Peter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll tell her on the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for listening to me May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to know about my nephew\u2019s crush. Y/N and Peter sitting in a tree,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay,\u201d Peter groaned</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, now go do homework, while I go make dinner and by make I mean do you want Chinese food?\u201d Peter laughed</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks May.\u201d Peter stood heading to his room</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Oh, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone. Suit.\u201d Peter inwardly groaned, he hopped she forgot about that, pulling his phone out, going into his room pulling his suit out and handing the items to May. Peter went back into his room and started on his homework.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>By the time the Starks made it home, it was dark out. Happy stopped at a fast food place and got them food. The trio said goodbye to Happy and made their way into the house. Y/N walked up the stairs throwing her backpack into the room and made her way back down the stairs, Y/N saw Pepper sitting on the couch, Morgan on the floor coloring in her book. Y/N sat next to Pepper.</p><p>\u201cPepper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t dad want anyone to know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was worried. Scared that something might happen to you.\u201d Y/N nodded, she remembered when her dad told her his worries, but she wanted to make sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he said that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel like this wouldn\u2019t have happened if you were still homeschooled, it\u2019s only been two days and you were already sent to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d Pepper laughed</p><p>\u201cWhat? Causing trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike father, like daughter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pepper, for everything.\u201d Pepper pulled Y/N into a hug</p><p>\u201cI wanna hug too.\u201d Morgan stood pouting</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Y/N opened her arm and Morgan joined the hug.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>1 day before the trip</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you taking your suit?\u201d Peter looked at Y/N\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just planning on relaxing.\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cSo, does MJ know yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Peter replied reaching for the bag of sour patches</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Y/N reached for a chocolate bar filled with almonds, Peter got other snacks for Ned and MJ</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I agreed to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed and MJ said it was a crime that you haven\u2019t seen Star Wars yet, so they said movie night. Plus we can all just carpool tomorrow to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sleepover, I only gave in because you gave me the puppy eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d Peter and Y/N walked to the register, she paid for the things. Peter and Y/N walked back towards his apartment, entering the apartment, she set the bag of snacks on the table\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi May, I brought you some chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYEAH?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCAN YOU COME AND HELP ME?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCOMING.\u201d Y/N walked into Peter\u2019s room, he was struggling with the blankets and pillows, rushing to him she grabbed a handful of pillows and a blanket. Y/N walked back into the living room, setting the stuff down on the couch</p><p>\u201cPeter is all this really necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He huffed out placing the blankets down. Peter turned and looked at the coffee table sitting in the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere should I move this?\u201d Peter mumbled</p><p>\u201cPeter just move it against the wall,\u201d May responded, Peter nodded easily picking up the table and moving it against the table, Y/N started setting the blankets down, the fluffiest ones on the bottom with the rest on top, placing the big fluffy pillows on top, she stepped back to admire her work, smiling she was satisfied. Peter stood next to Y/N, wrapping his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGood job Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Should we set up the screen now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe in a bit.\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cDo you guys want pizza for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Y/N and Peter replied</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll order now.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Peter laid on the edge of the blankets, Y/N next to him, MJ sat next to her and Ned next to MJ, all of them dressed in their PJs. They were about halfway through the movie, an empty pizza box in front of them along with wrappers from multiple snacks. Y/N could feel her eyes become heavy, Peter glanced at her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cGetting sleepy?\u201d Peter whispered in her ear</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re almost there, you can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Y/N shook her head and continued to watch the movie, the credits rolled on the screen</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ned asked</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was good. Should we put on another movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord of the rings?\u201d Ned asked MJ and Peter agreed. Y/N\u2019s eyes widened</p><p>\u201cUmmm, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Peter said</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen that either, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, what have you seen?\u201d MJ asked</p><p>\u201cUmm fandom wise just those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Peter go put it on.\u201d Peter stood and put the movie on, he snuggled back next to Y/N.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clean up before it starts.\u201d Y/N stood picking up the empty box and the wrappers, she stood in the kitchen throwing away the wrappers, folding the box and placing it on the counter. Y/N walked towards the blankets but stopped, MJ had moved over next to Peter, the two of them in a deep conversation, occasionally Ned would chime in. Y/N looked away and went into the restroom, sighing she grabbed her toothbrush and brushed her teeth. Y/N finished opening the door she made her way back to the blankets the movie had already started, she looked at Peter and MJ from the looks of it she had no plans in moving, Y/N sat next to Ned and quietly watched the movie. Y/N slowly started to become annoyed, she could hear their whispered and giggles every once in a while, they weren\u2019t including her in their conversation. Why should they? Y/N was an outcast in their group, they had been friends for a while now. Y/N just laid down and tried to ignore them, turning on her side she closed her eyes and fell asleep. Peter glanced at Y/N, he noticed she rolled her eyes, biting the inside of her cheek and eyes narrowed she was annoyed. Peter turned his attention back to MJ, why was she annoyed? Peter glanced back at Y/N, her back facing them, Ned noticed Peter\u2019s gaze and looked at Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe fell asleep.\u201d Peter chuckled</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Peter looked at the clock 11:15pm</p><p>\u201cWe should sleep too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d MJ and Ned agreed, the three rose carefully and made their way to the bathroom to brush their teeth. Ned and MJ finished and went back, Peter used the bathroom and walked back to the blankets, Ned had laid back down next to Y/N, he wanted to sleep next to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on Peter, we don\u2019t have all night.\u201d Peter looked at MJ and laid down next to her, Peter dimmed the lights</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d MJ and Ned replied, then they entered the world of darkness.</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>3:30am</p><p>Y/N rolled onto her back and groaned, slowly opening her eyes, she blinked. Why was it so dark? It\u2019s too dark in here, she couldn\u2019t see anything. Y/N sat up, back against the couch, reaching for her phone she turned on the flashlight, careful not to wake the others up, she stood and made her way into the bathroom. Peter heard the door close, he rolled over and noticed Y/N was missing from her spot, Peter sat up and sat on the couch. Y/N came out of the bathroom and squealed when she noticed a figure on the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d Peter whispered, Y/N relaxed and sat next to Peter</p><p>\u201cSorry for scaring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my senses kicked in and woke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooo, I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way, but it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to go back to sleep?\u201d Y/N asked</p><p>\u201cNightmare.\u201d Y/N nodded understanding</p><p>\u201cDo you think they have nightmares?\u201d Y/N asked cocking her head towards Ned and MJ</p><p>\u201cProbably normal ones, not about the snap or you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna talk about it?\u201d Y/N asked</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 We weren\u2019t able to stop Thanos and I turned around you\u2026 You were disappearing and Mr. Stark was lying on the floor, coughing up blood. I couldn\u2019t save you both.\u201d Peter felt Y/N\u2019s hand slip into his, she squeezed his hand</p><p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Peter said, looking at Y/N. Y/N scooted to the end of the couch and laid down, she opened her arms and patted her chest. Peter smiled and climbed into her arms, he snuggled against her neck, her fingers running through his curled brown hair.</p><p>\u201cNight Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Y/N woke up to the sound of a camera clicking. Not again, opening her eyes she saw me standing there taking pictures of the two teens</p><p>\u201cSorry, you just looked so adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c7. You guys should start getting up and ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk.\u201d May turned and walked into the kitchen, Y/N looked down at Peter, running her fingers through his hair and whispering</p><p>\u201cPeter. Peter. Get up.\u201d Peter moaned and tightened his grip</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna.\u201d Y/N laughed</p><p>\u201cPeter, get up, we have to get ready and eat.\u201d MJ looked at Y/N and Peter on the couch</p><p>\u201cMorning MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning everybody,\u201d Ned said brightly</p><p>\u201cGood morning Ned.\u201d MJ and Y/N replied Peter moaned again</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep\u2026 five more minutes.\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes</p><p>\u201cPete, get up. I\u2019m pretty sure Y/N wants to go brush her teeth and use the bathroom.\u201d Ned said</p><p>\u201cUghh, too comfy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, if you don\u2019t get up, I will use the secret weapon.\u201d Peter\u2019s head shot up, her stared int Y/N e/c eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me, Parker.\u201d Peter narrowed his eyes. Y/N lifted her hands, wiggling her fingers.</p><p>\u201cFine. Fine. I\u2019m up.\u201d Peter lifted himself from Y/N, she sat up and smiled</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter grumbled. Y/N made her way into Peter\u2019s room and grabbed her little bag filled with today\u2019s clothing. Y/N walked back into the living asking if anyone needed the restroom because she was going to shower, everyone replied no and Y/N went to shower.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>Happy was not happy driving a car full of teenagers to the airport, the music was blasting, the boys were singing off-key and dancing around, the girls singing on key and just stook to bobbing their heads from side to side. Happy groaned, New York traffic was the worst, he wished they could just zoom through and he could finally have some peace and quiet. Y/N turned and looked at Happy, she lowered the music</p><p>\u201cSorry uncle Happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries Little Stark, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re smiling and having fun.\u201d Y/N smiled</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try and keep it down.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0 Happy pulled into the parking lot, helping the kids unload their luggage, he followed behind the group of teens, making sure they didn\u2019t get hurt or lost. Y/N saw the group of students along with Mr. Dell and Mrs. Warren. Y/N turned back to Happy</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in 2 weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in 2 weeks, little Stark.\u201d Y/N smiled, Happy opened his arms and she jumped into them.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing us Happy,\u201d Peter said</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Hogan.\u201d MJ and Ned chimed in. Y/N pulled out of the hug and walked to the group.</p><p>\u201cNo problem kids, have fun.\u201d Happy waved, the three teens waved back and walked to their group. Mr. Dell looked like he was already having a panic attack, he counted each student multiple times, making sure he got the same number each time. Mrs. Warren was calm and collected as she started at the other teacher.</p><p>\u201cALRIGHT STUDENTS!\u201d The crowd went silent</p><p>\u201cWHEN I CALL YOUR NAME YELL HERE!\u201d Mrs. Warren started naming off the students alphabetically\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPETER PARKER!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHERE!\u201d Peter replied lifting his hand</p><p>\u201cY/N STARK!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHERE!\u201d Y/N replied she heard her classmates start to whisper. Peter held Y/N\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cParker, you and Stark here dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N replied firmly. Peter didn\u2019t like her he likes MJ. To Y/N MJ was definitely better than her. MJ looked at the two, eyebrow raised. Y/N cleared her throat and dropped Peter\u2019s hand. Peter\u2019s smile fell, Y/N never let go of his hand. The group made their way through customs and boarded the plane. Peter grabbed Y/N\u2019s hand making her sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u00a0 this isn\u2019t my seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can see if they\u2019ll switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry but that\u2019s my seat.\u201d Y/N looked at MJ, she stood and moved out of the way</p><p>\u201cSorry MJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d MJ placed her carry on overhead and sat in the seat. Y/N sat behind the two right next to Flash. Great. A 12-hour flight sitting next to Flash, maybe he won\u2019t be too bad today. Flash glanced over at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really did mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was sorry.\u201d Y/N looked at Flash, his dark brown eyes apologetic</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we start over?\u201d Y/N looked at the hand extended towards her, she grasped it and shook</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Flash smiled, the seat belt sign lit up and they buckled</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, this is your captain speaking. Our flight time will be of 12 hours and 40 minutes.\u00a0</p><p>At this time, make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position and that your seat belt is correctly fastened. Also, your portable electronic devices must be set to \u2018airplane\u2019 mode until an announcement is made upon arrival. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The cabin crew made their announcement next</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019d like to direct your attention to the television monitors. We will be showing our safety demonstration and would like the next few minutes of your complete attention.\u201d They watched the video, for Y/N this was nothing new she had been on planes so many times she lost count. 5 minutes after the video the pilot announced for the cabin crew to take their seats and prepare for taking off. Y/N hated the take off it made her sick to her stomach. The plane made its way gaining speed Y/N reached out and grabbed Flash\u2019s hand, she did this out of habit, she always held her dad\u2019s hand during take off and certain times it was Peter\u2019s hand. Peter turned around, looking between the seats. He saw Y/N\u2019s eyes closed shut, he looked down she was clutching Flash\u2019s hand. Peter\u2019s brows knitted, his stomach in knots, that was supposed to be him, she was supposed to be holding his hand, he was the one who should be comforting her not Flash. Peter scoffed and turned back around, crossing his arms, he knows he shouldn\u2019t feel jealous but he couldn\u2019t help it. Flash looked over at Y/N</p><p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d Y/N nodded</p><p>\u201cSorry I usually hold my dad\u2019s hand during taking off.\u201d Flash nodded, the plane finally leveled out and Y/N let go of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Y/N noticed Peter and MJ talking and laughing, she turned to her left and noticed Ned was talking to Betty. Y/N noticed that Betty definitely had a crush on Ned and Ned had a crush on Betty, she hoped the two of them would confess their feelings on this trip. Y/N turned back looking at her monitor, she scrolled through the movie options and decided to watch A Quiet Place, putting her headphones on, she ignored the world.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>3 hours later</p><p>Y/N was on her second movie when she heard the pilot speak</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned off the Fasten Seat Belt sign, and you may now move around the cabin. In a few moments, the flight attendants will be passing around the cabin to offer you hot or cold drinks, as well as breakfast/dinner/supper/a light meal/snack. Alcoholic drinks are also available at a nominal charge/with our compliments.\u201d\u00a0 The flight attendant reached Y/N and asked if she would like a snack, she grabbed water, chips, cookies and some fruit, she turned attention back to the movie.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>2 hours later</p><p>Y/N sighed, they had 7 hours to go and she was bored out of her mind, she stood and walked up and down the small hallway, she needed to stretch. Peter noticed Y/N walking up and down the cabin, he stood and followed behind her. Y/N turned and bumped straight into Peter.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me move over so you can get through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I just wanted to talk to you, you looked bored back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, watched 3 movies and gave up after that. Flash\u2019s uncomfortable around me still so no talking. You and MJ seem to be having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was talking to me about a book she\u2019s reading, plus she brought UNO so we\u2019ve been playing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me miss, sir, you can\u2019t block the hall.\u201dA flight attendant said</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Peter said, they walked back to their seats. Y/N sat down and Peter turned around in his seat.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brad?\u201d Brad looked forward and at Peter</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we switch seats for a bit?\u201d Peter glanced at you and back to Brad, Brad smiled</p><p>\u201cSure Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Peter and Brad switched, Peter was now sitting to your left right across from you.</p><p>\u201cYou left MJ all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Now I can actually get some peace and quiet and read.\u201d MJ chimed in</p><p>\u201cHeyyy,\u201d Peter whined, Mj placed a finger on her lips and making Peter shut up.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>8 hours into the flight</p><p>Y/N looked around, everyone around them had fallen asleep. Peter felt his eyes slowly start to close, Y/N smiled and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNight Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The lights on the plane came on and everyone woke with a groan.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, as we start our descent, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position. Make sure your seat belt is securely fastened and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. Thank you.\u201d The Captain announced, Y/N stood and made her way to the bathroom before the seat belt sign came on. Everyone else followed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFlight attendants, prepare for landing please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCabin crew, please take your seats for landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have just been cleared to land at the Venice Marco Polo Airport. Please make sure one last time your seat belt is securely fastened. The flight attendants are currently passing around the cabin to make a final compliance check and pick up any remaining cups and glasses. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N felt the plane started it\u2019s decent and Peter reached for her hand, she looked at Peter he gave her a reassuring smile, his thumb drawing circles on her palm.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, welcome to Venice Marco Polo Airport. Local time is 9:30pm and the temperature is 70 degrees. For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the Captain turns off the Fasten Seat Belt sign. This will indicate that we have parked at the gate and that it is safe for you to move about. Please check around your seat for any personal belongings you may have brought on board with you and please use caution when opening the overhead bins, as heavy articles may have shifted around during the flight. If you require deplaning assistance, please remain in your seat until all other passengers have deplaned. One of our crew members will then be pleased to assist you. On behalf of the entire crew, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us on this trip and we are looking forward to seeing you on board again in the near future. Have a nice stay!\u201d</p><p>Everyone clapped as the plane came to a stop, they all stood to grab their carry-ons, Peter and Y/N were still holding hands as they walked off the plane to the baggage claim. Y/N rested her head onto Peter\u2019s shoulder, grabbing their luggage they walked to Mr. Dell and Mrs. Warren, the rest of the class followed. Mrs. Warren did roll call once again and once she noted everyone was there, they went outside and into the bus. No one was talking, just wanted to get to the hotel and sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>They all piled off the bus, Mr. Dell giving out room keys and listing their roommates, Peter was rooming with Ned and MJ was rooming with Y/N.

Y/N walked closer to the stranger, long raven hair, pale skin, his clothes green black and gold. Loki opened his eyes feeling a presence. Y/N stared into his sky blue eyes.

This was a trick a way to get more information out of him, he needed to get the job done, he would not fail, he would not break.</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Can you please start?

Y/N&rsquo;s heartbeat echoed in her ears, it was beating fast it was too loud, she was nervous Peter could hear it, but all Peter could hear was the sound of his own heart. Peter climbed into the bed and laid down next to Y/N.</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y can you lower the lights the 15%.&rdquo; The lights dimmed, even more, a slight glow still illuminated the room. Y/N was scared of the dark, bad things happened in the dark. Y/N rolled on her side, staring at the side of Peter&rsquo;s face, Peter rolled over to face Y/N, he smiled at her, reaching out, he moved the start strand of her hair away from her face, Y/N smiled</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Good night Peter.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Good night Y/N.\"&nbsp;</b></i></p><p><i><b>6:30am</b></i></p><p>Peter groaned cuddling into Y/N&rsquo;s neck, even more, his hair tickling Y&rsquo;N&rsquo;s nose, it twitched. They both haven&rsquo;t slept so peacefully in weeks, Peter&rsquo;s arms wrapped right around Y/N bringing her peace she&rsquo;s never known before, a calming of the storms in her heart. Peter believes it&rsquo;s her that gives him hope for the future. In each other&rsquo;s embrace, they start to believe that there is nothing out there to fear, that all there is, is sunshine. Peter groaned once again once he heard giggling and saw a faded flash from his closed eyes he slowly opened his eyes to see Morgan standing in front of them with a Polaroid camera in hand. Peter sat up slightly, Morgan&rsquo;s brown eyes widened she ran away while giggling. Y/N groaned and she felt Peter shift stretching her arm out wrapping it around Peter&rsquo;s waist he laid back down and ran his fingers through her h/c hair, Peter smiled looking down at her, her chest rising and falling, her eyelids slightly fluttering, mouth slightly open, drool making its way down her cheek. Peter laughed, Y/N groaned feeling Peter&rsquo;s chest vibrate</p><p>&ldquo;5 more minutes..&rdquo; Y/N mumbled against his chest</p><p>&ldquo;As much as I want that, it&rsquo;s almost 7.&rdquo; Y/N shot up getting slightly light headed.</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Peter rolled over grabbing his phone showing her the time. 6:40am&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh my god! We&rsquo;re going to be late!&rdquo; Peter leaned on his side staring at Y/N looking around frantically then she stopped realizing what she probably looked like.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god! Peter close your eyes.&rdquo; Y/N squealed placing her hand over his eyes. Peter laughed</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo; Grabbing her hand and pulling it down, Y/N raced to place her other hand over his eyes</p><p>&ldquo;Because I probably look like a mess.&rdquo; Peter moved her hand once again and looked into her e/c eyes</p><p>&ldquo;You look perfect,&rdquo; he whispered. Y/N felt her face flush, Peter felt the same, his face bright red then a flash disrupted them, turning their heads to see Morgan standing there with a big smile on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Mama told me to come and get you guys because breakfast is ready,&rdquo; and with that Morgan ran off into the house. Y/N shook her head standing up Peter followed her movements, grabbing his backpack and picking up the blanket</p><p>&ldquo;I can take that Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s fine, just lead the way.&rdquo; Peter followed Y/N into the house, their noses greeted with the smell of eggs, bacon, and toast. Pepper stood in front of the island arms across her chest, eyebrows raised. Y/N flinched she had a whole lot of explaining to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Pepper.&rdquo; Y/N whispered as she sat on the chair</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Mrs. Stark,&rdquo; Peter mumbled with his head down sitting next to Y/N</p><p>&ldquo;Good Morning Y/N, Peter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Y/N, Peter!&rdquo; Morgan yelled out sitting on the other side of Y/N</p><p>&ldquo;Morning Morgan.&rdquo; The two teens replied</p><p>&ldquo;So, do one of you want to talk or&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Pepper. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep so I went outside and Peter came, we were talking and fell asleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pepper sighed</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the two of you being together but I prefer that you didn&rsquo;t sneak around,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to disrespect you, Mrs. Stark.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Also no more sleepovers, I mean if you do it&rsquo;ll be in separate rooms, doors open.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad?&rdquo; Y/N asked munching on her toast</p><p>&ldquo;A bit, but I&rsquo;d rather you tell me that you two are hanging out than sneaking around.&rdquo; Y/N nodded</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Pepper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Mrs. Stark.&rdquo; Pepper smiled</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, finish breakfast and go get ready still got to go to school.&rdquo; The two teens nodded, Peter stood and headed to the restroom</p><p>&ldquo;Oh and Peter,&rdquo; Peter turned and looked at Pepper</p><p>&ldquo;Call your Aunt, she called here last night worried.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened, he nodded and went into the restroom. Peter frantically changed into his clothes grabbing his phone pressing the number one, he heard the phone ring.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aunt May? I&rsquo;m so sorry I didn&rsquo;t call, Y/N messaged me and I came over, we started talking and we fell asleep. I&rsquo;m so sorry I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you worry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A text would have been nice Peter, I called everywhere. I called Ned, MJ, hospitals and then when I called Pepper, she said that you had gone over and fell asleep. Do you know how worried I was? I thought something bad happened to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Aunt May&hellip;&rdquo; Peter whispered out, he heard her sigh</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine Peter, just please next time call me or text me. Also, you&rsquo;re grounded for a week, no patrolling, no TV and no going out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; Peter inwardly groaned, grounded a week and a half before the vacation, well at least she didn&rsquo;t say she couldn&rsquo;t go.</p><p>&ldquo;Get going, you&rsquo;re going to be late for school. I larb you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I larb you too Aunt May.&rdquo; Peter smiled and hung up the phone</p><p>Y/N stood and made her way to her room, using the restroom to brush her teeth, comb her hair, Y/N changed into denim jeans and a plain grey shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be late!&rdquo; Pepper yelled</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; Y/N yelled back, shoving her homework in her backpack and ran down the stairs</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; Peter smiled</p><p>&ldquo;Ready little stark? Kid?&rdquo; They nodded, Y/N ran to Pepper and kissed her cheek, she ran to Morgan and kissed her cheek</p><p>&ldquo;Bye Pepper, bye Morgan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye Mrs. Stark, bye Morgan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye kids, have fun at school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;BYE Y/N, BYE PETER!&rdquo; Morgan yelled and waved.</p><p>Peter, Y/N, and Happy exited the house, Peter hopped into the backseat and Y/N followed, Happy turned to his right expecting her to sit in the front but instead saw an empty seat</p><p>&ldquo;I see how it is a little Stark.&rdquo; Happy whispered and smiled looking at the two teenagers.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;WAIT! WAIT!&rdquo; Y/N turned around to see Morgan running towards the car, opening the door she looked down at her younger sister</p><p>&ldquo;Here..you&hellip;go!&rdquo; Morgan said gasping to catch her breathe she handed Y/N a brown bag</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open it until you&rsquo;re alone.&rdquo; Morgan smiled and ran back into the house, Y/N closed the door and looked at Peter</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d she give you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No idea, she said to open it when I&rsquo;m alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I can&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can show you after I open it.&rdquo; Peter nodded and smiled.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Peter and Y/N made it to school 20 minutes late, they tried sneaking past the office but failed now they are sitting in the principal&rsquo;s office, Y/N twirled her thumbs around, Peter didn&rsquo;t look nervous one bit he was used to this.</p><p>\"Miss. Stark and Mr. Parker, nice to see you again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t that late.&rdquo; The principal sighed</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let this slide because I understand that Miss Stark is going through a difficult time.&rdquo; Y/N met his eyes filled with pity. Y/N glared slightly, she hated being pitted on.</p><p>&ldquo;Get to class, both of you.&rdquo; Y/N stood along with Peter and went straight to the English class.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Lunch came around and Y/N smiled, chicken, mac and cheese, grapes and water. Y/N sat in the back remembering what Morgan gave her in the morning she opened her backpack and opened the brown bag. Y/N pulled out 12 Polaroid pictures that Morgan took in the morning, each a double. A little note fell from the pictures</p><p>One for you and one for Peter- Morgan</p><p>Y/N smiled and looked through each picture, one where Peter was laying on her chest arms wrapped around her waist a smile on his face, the next was of her laying on Peter&rsquo;s chest her arms wrapped around his waist a smile on her face, the next photo Peter was awake, kissing her forehead, Y/N blushed at the photo. When did he do that? She didn&rsquo;t even realize. The next photo was one of the two of them forehead to forehead, a smile on both their faces and slightly flushed. Moving to the next set it was of Peter moving a stray strand of hair away from Y/N&rsquo;s face and the last set was a photo that Happy took of Peter, Morgan and her, Morgan in Peter&rsquo;s arms, Peter made a funny face to make Morgan and Y/N laughed, Y/N smiled, they looked like a happy family. Y/N heard someone clear their throat quickly putting the photos away she looked up to see Flash staring at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is what Penis-&rdquo; Y/N glared and Flash flinched</p><p>&ldquo;Is what Parker said true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That he actually worked with Tony Stark and met all the other Avengers?&rdquo; Y/N lifted a brow</p><p>&ldquo;Why so curious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So he is a liar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter doesn&rsquo;t lie. Yes, he worked with my father, aunts, and uncles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father? Tony Stark only has 1 kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you like one of those delusional fans?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know the fans who like to pretend they know the person. Let&rsquo;s be honest if you&rsquo;re Tony Stark&rsquo;s kid then I&rsquo;m Captain America&rsquo;s kid. If you are his kid, why have we never seen or heard of you? Was he embarrassed by you?&rdquo; Y/N felt tears prickle her eyes, was Tony embarrassed by her? No. He did it to protect her, he was Iron man she could have gotten hurt. Tony would never be embarrassed by her, he was proud of her.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought Parker was a liar, but you took first place.&rdquo; Y/N felt the tears rolled down her cheeks</p><p>&ldquo;FLASH!&rdquo; Flash turned towards the voice, Peter standing behind him, dropping his food, he raised his fist hitting Flash straight on the jaw, Flash fell to the ground clenching his jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell, Parker!?&rdquo; Peter ignored him and sat next to Y/N, placing his hands on her cheeks he wiped her tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; Y/N shook her head</p><p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; Grabbing her hand he pulled her out of the cafeteria, making his way to the roof of the school. Peter sat down, pulling her down with him. Y/N rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Peter.&rdquo; Peter turned to look at her</p><p>&ldquo;What are you sorry for? You have nothing to be sorry for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you punched him, you might get suspended or expelled or worse you might not be able to go on the trip so you can forget about Spider-Man, my dad, Pepper, Morgan and me. You need to go on that trip to forget about everything.&rdquo; Y/N rambled lifting her head from his shoulder</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, hey,&rdquo; Peter caressed her face, forcing her to look at him</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going to forget you. Ever. I&rsquo;m never going to forget Mr. Stark, Mrs. Stark or Morgan, you guys mean so much to me. Do you want to forget about me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; Y/N said confidently staring into his brown eyes, they twinkled when she said that.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard what he said.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Y/N e/c eyes look down&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wrong you know. Mr. Stark loves you, he always mentioned you when I would visit the compound, how you managed to help build Veronica, an anti-gravity device,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That one was a secret.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well he found out and you built my suit. Mr. Stark told me how proud he was when you finished the Iron Spider suit when I asked him about the suit he said &ldquo;Kid, Y/N built it. I was worried at first because she started to be more and more like me, but she had this big smile on her face when working on your suit I couldn&rsquo;t stop her and when she finished it she ran to me screaming, yelling DAD DAD DAD I DID IT I DID IT. She dragged me into the lab and showed me the suit, her smile so wide, I&rsquo;m pretty sure her face hurt from how much she was smiling, my face hurt from smiling, I have never been so proud of her. I can just hope nothing happened to her.&rdquo; I just stared at him and thought he really loves her.&rdquo; Y/N felt the tears rolling down her cheeks once again. Peter smiled and wiped her tears</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Peter.&rdquo; Y/N whispered</p><p>&ldquo;Anytime.&rdquo; Y/N calmed herself and grabbed her backpack, pulling out the brown bag.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready to see?&rdquo; Peter nodded, Y/N pulled out the pictures and handed them to Peter. Peter looked at the polaroids sitting in his hands, his face turned red when he saw the sets. Peter never noticed how much of a couple they looked like, he loved the thought of it, did she even notice? Did she think about it? Peter saw the last set of photos, he was holding Morgan, his face scrunched up, tongue sticking out, Morgan and Y/N facing him laughing, he wanted to have a family with Y/N. Peter blushed at the thought, he let out a cough. Y/N smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Morgan said one for me and one for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo; Peter chose his photos and handed the others back to Y/N. Peter pulled a folder from his bag and placed them in there. Y/N grabbed her bag and placed them in her notebook.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should we head back?&rdquo; Peter sighed</p><p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too bad. Come on.&rdquo; Y/N grabbed Peter&rsquo;s hand, standing and pulling him up with her. Y/N and Peter walked down the stairs hand in hand.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker, Miss Stark.&rdquo; They froze</p><p>&ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; Shit.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and Y/N sat in their chairs, shifting uncomfortably feeling May&rsquo;s stare and Pepper&rsquo;s stare burning holes into their faces. Flash sat on the right side of them with his father.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you all for coming, the reason you are all here is that Mr. Parker here hit Mr. Thompson.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; May said&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You hit someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May I didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose or for no reason.&rdquo; May sighed, her fingers pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p>&ldquo;We have a no violence policy in this school and I&rsquo;m considering taking Mr. Parker off the Europe trip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Y/N butted in</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; Pepper warned her</p><p>&ldquo;But Pepper, he can&rsquo;t do that. Flash was being a jerk to me and Peter protected me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Stark-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NO! You&rsquo;re seriously going to sit here and take the bully&rsquo;s side. Flash sat there and took me that I wasn&rsquo;t my dad&rsquo;s daughter and that I was nothing but disappointment and embarrassment to him.&rdquo; Y/N looked at Pepper, Pepper&rsquo;s blue eyes widened, reaching out placing her hand on Y/N&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper, did dad ever feel that way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not, he never felt that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Flash is this true?&rdquo; A deep rough voice spoke</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see. There&rsquo;s no need to take Mr. Parker off the trip. I&rsquo;m willing to let this go since my son did decide to bully Miss Stark here. I&rsquo;m sorry Mrs. Stark. Apologize.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Y/N looked at Flash</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok.&rdquo; The group walked out of the office</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! PETER!&rdquo; Morgan ran towards the teens</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Morgan.&rdquo; They replied</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper can we give Peter and May a ride home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Morgan stood between Peter and Y/N and held each of their hands, the three walked behind May and Pepper. Y/N looked over to Peter, they were in trouble.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Peter and May hopped out of the car before they reached the door Y/N hopped out of the car</p><p>&ldquo;May,&rdquo; May turned around</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what happened wasn&rsquo;t Peter&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know sweetie.&rdquo; May smiled</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on him.&rdquo; May laughed and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see at school tomorrow Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo; Y/N waved, she got into the car and they drove off. Peter and May entered the building and into their apartment. Peter threw his backpack into his room and sat down on the couch, his leg bouncing up and down, fingers running through his hair. He heard May sigh and felt her sit next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you wanted to protect her, but next time try not to hit him. Same rules apply, no patrolling, no going out, no TV and no phone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;May, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know Peter.&rdquo; May smiled at her nephew</p><p>&ldquo;Good for you though, protecting your crush.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-What? I I don&rsquo;t have a crush on Y/N.&rdquo; May raised a brow</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s blood rushed to his face</p><p>&ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo; Peter asked shyly</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, just a tad.&rdquo; Peter groaned</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cute Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she likes me in that way anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just,&rdquo; Peter ran his fingers through his hair again</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just amazing, you know. She&rsquo;s insanely smart, funny, gentle, understanding and beautiful. And her smile May, God her smile, it lights up my world, it makes my heart race every time. I would do anything to keep that smile on her face. She makes me feel calm, safe and she feels like home like it&rsquo;s only the two of us and there&rsquo;s no evil in the world. She just takes my breath away.&rdquo; May stared at Peter, his face red, a shy smile on his face, brown eyes twinkled and filled with love. May knew that he watched her like she had the stars in her hands and soft petals at her feet, he wanted to wrap her in his arms and never let go. May smiled at Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;You should tell her how you feel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No, I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if she doesn&rsquo;t like me? I don&rsquo;t want to ruin the friendship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take a chance, Peter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;ll tell her on the trip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for listening to me May.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I want to know about my nephew&rsquo;s crush. Y/N and Peter sitting in a tree,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May,&rdquo; Peter groaned</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kidding, now go do homework, while I go make dinner and by make I mean do you want Chinese food?&rdquo; Peter laughed</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, thanks May.&rdquo; Peter stood heading to his room</p><p>&ldquo;No problem. Oh, Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phone. Suit.&rdquo; Peter inwardly groaned, he hopped she forgot about that, pulling his phone out, going into his room pulling his suit out and handing the items to May. Peter went back into his room and started on his homework.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>By the time the Starks made it home, it was dark out. Happy stopped at a fast food place and got them food. The trio said goodbye to Happy and made their way into the house. Y/N walked up the stairs throwing her backpack into the room and made her way back down the stairs, Y/N saw Pepper sitting on the couch, Morgan on the floor coloring in her book. Y/N sat next to Pepper.</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t dad want anyone to know about me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was worried. Scared that something might happen to you.&rdquo; Y/N nodded, she remembered when her dad told her his worries, but she wanted to make sure.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry he said that to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you be sorry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just feel like this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if you were still homeschooled, it&rsquo;s only been two days and you were already sent to the office.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo; Pepper laughed</p><p>&ldquo;What? Causing trouble?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like father, like daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Pepper, for everything.&rdquo; Pepper pulled Y/N into a hug</p><p>&ldquo;I wanna hug too.&rdquo; Morgan stood pouting</p><p>&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; Y/N opened her arm and Morgan joined the hug.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>1 day before the trip</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you taking your suit?&rdquo; Peter looked at Y/N&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m just planning on relaxing.&rdquo; Y/N nodded</p><p>&ldquo;So, does MJ know yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Peter replied reaching for the bag of sour patches</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Y/N reached for a chocolate bar filled with almonds, Peter got other snacks for Ned and MJ</p><p>&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe I agreed to this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ned and MJ said it was a crime that you haven&rsquo;t seen Star Wars yet, so they said movie night. Plus we can all just carpool tomorrow to the airport.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So sleepover, I only gave in because you gave me the puppy eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, yeah.&rdquo; Peter and Y/N walked to the register, she paid for the things. Peter and Y/N walked back towards his apartment, entering the apartment, she set the bag of snacks on the table&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, sweetie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi May, I brought you some chocolate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sweetie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;YEAH?!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;CAN YOU COME AND HELP ME?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;COMING.&rdquo; Y/N walked into Peter&rsquo;s room, he was struggling with the blankets and pillows, rushing to him she grabbed a handful of pillows and a blanket. Y/N walked back into the living room, setting the stuff down on the couch</p><p>&ldquo;Peter is all this really necessary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He huffed out placing the blankets down. Peter turned and looked at the coffee table sitting in the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Where should I move this?&rdquo; Peter mumbled</p><p>&ldquo;Peter just move it against the wall,&rdquo; May responded, Peter nodded easily picking up the table and moving it against the table, Y/N started setting the blankets down, the fluffiest ones on the bottom with the rest on top, placing the big fluffy pillows on top, she stepped back to admire her work, smiling she was satisfied. Peter stood next to Y/N, wrapping his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Good job Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. Should we set up the screen now?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe in a bit.&rdquo; Y/N nodded</p><p>&ldquo;Do you guys want pizza for dinner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo; Y/N and Peter replied</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll order now.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Peter laid on the edge of the blankets, Y/N next to him, MJ sat next to her and Ned next to MJ, all of them dressed in their PJs. They were about halfway through the movie, an empty pizza box in front of them along with wrappers from multiple snacks. Y/N could feel her eyes become heavy, Peter glanced at her and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Getting sleepy?&rdquo; Peter whispered in her ear</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost there, you can do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Y/N shook her head and continued to watch the movie, the credits rolled on the screen</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Ned asked</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you like it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it was good. Should we put on another movie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lord of the rings?&rdquo; Ned asked MJ and Peter agreed. Y/N&rsquo;s eyes widened</p><p>&ldquo;Ummm, sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; Peter said</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never seen that either, have you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, what have you seen?&rdquo; MJ asked</p><p>&ldquo;Umm fandom wise just those two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Peter go put it on.&rdquo; Peter stood and put the movie on, he snuggled back next to Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to clean up before it starts.&rdquo; Y/N stood picking up the empty box and the wrappers, she stood in the kitchen throwing away the wrappers, folding the box and placing it on the counter. Y/N walked towards the blankets but stopped, MJ had moved over next to Peter, the two of them in a deep conversation, occasionally Ned would chime in. Y/N looked away and went into the restroom, sighing she grabbed her toothbrush and brushed her teeth. Y/N finished opening the door she made her way back to the blankets the movie had already started, she looked at Peter and MJ from the looks of it she had no plans in moving, Y/N sat next to Ned and quietly watched the movie. Y/N slowly started to become annoyed, she could hear their whispered and giggles every once in a while, they weren&rsquo;t including her in their conversation. Why should they? Y/N was an outcast in their group, they had been friends for a while now. Y/N just laid down and tried to ignore them, turning on her side she closed her eyes and fell asleep. Peter glanced at Y/N, he noticed she rolled her eyes, biting the inside of her cheek and eyes narrowed she was annoyed. Peter turned his attention back to MJ, why was she annoyed? Peter glanced back at Y/N, her back facing them, Ned noticed Peter&rsquo;s gaze and looked at Y/N&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;She fell asleep.&rdquo; Peter chuckled</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Peter looked at the clock 11:15pm</p><p>&ldquo;We should sleep too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; MJ and Ned agreed, the three rose carefully and made their way to the bathroom to brush their teeth. Ned and MJ finished and went back, Peter used the bathroom and walked back to the blankets, Ned had laid back down next to Y/N, he wanted to sleep next to Y/N.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on Peter, we don&rsquo;t have all night.&rdquo; Peter looked at MJ and laid down next to her, Peter dimmed the lights</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo; MJ and Ned replied, then they entered the world of darkness.</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>3:30am</p><p>Y/N rolled onto her back and groaned, slowly opening her eyes, she blinked. Why was it so dark? It&rsquo;s too dark in here, she couldn&rsquo;t see anything. Y/N sat up, back against the couch, reaching for her phone she turned on the flashlight, careful not to wake the others up, she stood and made her way into the bathroom. Peter heard the door close, he rolled over and noticed Y/N was missing from her spot, Peter sat up and sat on the couch. Y/N came out of the bathroom and squealed when she noticed a figure on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just me,&rdquo; Peter whispered, Y/N relaxed and sat next to Peter</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for scaring you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. Did I wake you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, my senses kicked in and woke me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sooo, I woke you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In a way, but it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to go back to sleep?&rdquo; Y/N asked</p><p>&ldquo;Nightmare.&rdquo; Y/N nodded understanding</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think they have nightmares?&rdquo; Y/N asked cocking her head towards Ned and MJ</p><p>&ldquo;Probably normal ones, not about the snap or you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Must be nice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna talk about it?&rdquo; Y/N asked</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; We weren&rsquo;t able to stop Thanos and I turned around you&hellip; You were disappearing and Mr. Stark was lying on the floor, coughing up blood. I couldn&rsquo;t save you both.&rdquo; Peter felt Y/N&rsquo;s hand slip into his, she squeezed his hand</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, it&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m still here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Peter said, looking at Y/N. Y/N scooted to the end of the couch and laid down, she opened her arms and patted her chest. Peter smiled and climbed into her arms, he snuggled against her neck, her fingers running through his curled brown hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Night Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Y/N woke up to the sound of a camera clicking. Not again, opening her eyes she saw me standing there taking pictures of the two teens</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, you just looked so adorable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. What time is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;7. You guys should start getting up and ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; May turned and walked into the kitchen, Y/N looked down at Peter, running her fingers through his hair and whispering</p><p>&ldquo;Peter. Peter. Get up.&rdquo; Peter moaned and tightened his grip</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna.&rdquo; Y/N laughed</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, get up, we have to get ready and eat.&rdquo; MJ looked at Y/N and Peter on the couch</p><p>&ldquo;Morning MJ.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Morning Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning everybody,&rdquo; Ned said brightly</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Ned.&rdquo; MJ and Y/N replied Peter moaned again</p><p>&ldquo;Go back to sleep&hellip; five more minutes.&rdquo; Y/N rolled her eyes</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, get up. I&rsquo;m pretty sure Y/N wants to go brush her teeth and use the bathroom.&rdquo; Ned said</p><p>&ldquo;Ughh, too comfy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, if you don&rsquo;t get up, I will use the secret weapon.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s head shot up, her stared int Y/N e/c eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try me, Parker.&rdquo; Peter narrowed his eyes. Y/N lifted her hands, wiggling her fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. Fine. I&rsquo;m up.&rdquo; Peter lifted himself from Y/N, she sat up and smiled</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Peter grumbled. Y/N made her way into Peter&rsquo;s room and grabbed her little bag filled with today&rsquo;s clothing. Y/N walked back into the living asking if anyone needed the restroom because she was going to shower, everyone replied no and Y/N went to shower.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Happy was not happy driving a car full of teenagers to the airport, the music was blasting, the boys were singing off-key and dancing around, the girls singing on key and just stook to bobbing their heads from side to side. Happy groaned, New York traffic was the worst, he wished they could just zoom through and he could finally have some peace and quiet. Y/N turned and looked at Happy, she lowered the music</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry uncle Happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No worries Little Stark, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re smiling and having fun.&rdquo; Y/N smiled</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and keep it down.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happy pulled into the parking lot, helping the kids unload their luggage, he followed behind the group of teens, making sure they didn&rsquo;t get hurt or lost. Y/N saw the group of students along with Mr. Dell and Mrs. Warren. Y/N turned back to Happy</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in 2 weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See you in 2 weeks, little Stark.&rdquo; Y/N smiled, Happy opened his arms and she jumped into them.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for bringing us Happy,&rdquo; Peter said</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Hogan.&rdquo; MJ and Ned chimed in. Y/N pulled out of the hug and walked to the group.</p><p>&ldquo;No problem kids, have fun.&rdquo; Happy waved, the three teens waved back and walked to their group. Mr. Dell looked like he was already having a panic attack, he counted each student multiple times, making sure he got the same number each time. Mrs. Warren was calm and collected as she started at the other teacher.</p><p>&ldquo;ALRIGHT STUDENTS!&rdquo; The crowd went silent</p><p>&ldquo;WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME YELL HERE!&rdquo; Mrs. Warren started naming off the students alphabetically&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;PETER PARKER!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;HERE!&rdquo; Peter replied lifting his hand</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N STARK!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;HERE!&rdquo; Y/N replied she heard her classmates start to whisper. Peter held Y/N&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Parker, you and Stark here dating?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Y/N replied firmly. Peter didn&rsquo;t like her he likes MJ. To Y/N MJ was definitely better than her. MJ looked at the two, eyebrow raised. Y/N cleared her throat and dropped Peter&rsquo;s hand. Peter&rsquo;s smile fell, Y/N never let go of his hand. The group made their way through customs and boarded the plane. Peter grabbed Y/N&rsquo;s hand making her sit next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter&nbsp; this isn&rsquo;t my seat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can see if they&rsquo;ll switch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry but that&rsquo;s my seat.&rdquo; Y/N looked at MJ, she stood and moved out of the way</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry MJ.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; MJ placed her carry on overhead and sat in the seat. Y/N sat behind the two right next to Flash. Great. A 12-hour flight sitting next to Flash, maybe he won&rsquo;t be too bad today. Flash glanced over at Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Y/N,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Flash.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really did mean it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mean what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I was sorry.&rdquo; Y/N looked at Flash, his dark brown eyes apologetic</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine Flash.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can we start over?&rdquo; Y/N looked at the hand extended towards her, she grasped it and shook</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Flash smiled, the seat belt sign lit up and they buckled</p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, this is your captain speaking. Our flight time will be of 12 hours and 40 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position and that your seat belt is correctly fastened. Also, your portable electronic devices must be set to &lsquo;airplane&rsquo; mode until an announcement is made upon arrival. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>The cabin crew made their announcement next</p><p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I&rsquo;d like to direct your attention to the television monitors. We will be showing our safety demonstration and would like the next few minutes of your complete attention.&rdquo; They watched the video, for Y/N this was nothing new she had been on planes so many times she lost count. 5 minutes after the video the pilot announced for the cabin crew to take their seats and prepare for taking off. Y/N hated the take off it made her sick to her stomach. The plane made its way gaining speed Y/N reached out and grabbed Flash&rsquo;s hand, she did this out of habit, she always held her dad&rsquo;s hand during take off and certain times it was Peter&rsquo;s hand. Peter turned around, looking between the seats. He saw Y/N&rsquo;s eyes closed shut, he looked down she was clutching Flash&rsquo;s hand. Peter&rsquo;s brows knitted, his stomach in knots, that was supposed to be him, she was supposed to be holding his hand, he was the one who should be comforting her not Flash. Peter scoffed and turned back around, crossing his arms, he knows he shouldn&rsquo;t feel jealous but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. Flash looked over at Y/N</p><p>&ldquo;You ok?&rdquo; Y/N nodded</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I usually hold my dad&rsquo;s hand during taking off.&rdquo; Flash nodded, the plane finally leveled out and Y/N let go of his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; Y/N noticed Peter and MJ talking and laughing, she turned to her left and noticed Ned was talking to Betty. Y/N noticed that Betty definitely had a crush on Ned and Ned had a crush on Betty, she hoped the two of them would confess their feelings on this trip. Y/N turned back looking at her monitor, she scrolled through the movie options and decided to watch A Quiet Place, putting her headphones on, she ignored the world.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>3 hours later</p><p>Y/N was on her second movie when she heard the pilot speak</p><p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned off the Fasten Seat Belt sign, and you may now move around the cabin. In a few moments, the flight attendants will be passing around the cabin to offer you hot or cold drinks, as well as breakfast/dinner/supper/a light meal/snack. Alcoholic drinks are also available at a nominal charge/with our compliments.&rdquo;&nbsp; The flight attendant reached Y/N and asked if she would like a snack, she grabbed water, chips, cookies and some fruit, she turned attention back to the movie.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>2 hours later</p><p>Y/N sighed, they had 7 hours to go and she was bored out of her mind, she stood and walked up and down the small hallway, she needed to stretch. Peter noticed Y/N walking up and down the cabin, he stood and followed behind her. Y/N turned and bumped straight into Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me move over so you can get through.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I just wanted to talk to you, you looked bored back there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, watched 3 movies and gave up after that. Flash&rsquo;s uncomfortable around me still so no talking. You and MJ seem to be having fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she was talking to me about a book she&rsquo;s reading, plus she brought UNO so we&rsquo;ve been playing that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me miss, sir, you can&rsquo;t block the hall.&rdquo;A flight attendant said</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry,&rdquo; Peter said, they walked back to their seats. Y/N sat down and Peter turned around in his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Brad?&rdquo; Brad looked forward and at Peter</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can we switch seats for a bit?&rdquo; Peter glanced at you and back to Brad, Brad smiled</p><p>&ldquo;Sure Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Peter and Brad switched, Peter was now sitting to your left right across from you.</p><p>&ldquo;You left MJ all alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. Now I can actually get some peace and quiet and read.&rdquo; MJ chimed in</p><p>&ldquo;Heyyy,&rdquo; Peter whined, Mj placed a finger on her lips and making Peter shut up.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>8 hours into the flight</p><p>Y/N looked around, everyone around them had fallen asleep. Peter felt his eyes slowly start to close, Y/N smiled and closed her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Night Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>The lights on the plane came on and everyone woke with a groan.</p><p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, as we start our descent, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position. Make sure your seat belt is securely fastened and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. Thank you.&rdquo; The Captain announced, Y/N stood and made her way to the bathroom before the seat belt sign came on. Everyone else followed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Flight attendants, prepare for landing please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cabin crew, please take your seats for landing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, we have just been cleared to land at the Venice Marco Polo Airport. Please make sure one last time your seat belt is securely fastened. The flight attendants are currently passing around the cabin to make a final compliance check and pick up any remaining cups and glasses. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N felt the plane started it&rsquo;s decent and Peter reached for her hand, she looked at Peter he gave her a reassuring smile, his thumb drawing circles on her palm.</p><p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Venice Marco Polo Airport. Local time is 9:30pm and the temperature is 70 degrees. For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the Captain turns off the Fasten Seat Belt sign. This will indicate that we have parked at the gate and that it is safe for you to move about. Please check around your seat for any personal belongings you may have brought on board with you and please use caution when opening the overhead bins, as heavy articles may have shifted around during the flight. If you require deplaning assistance, please remain in your seat until all other passengers have deplaned. One of our crew members will then be pleased to assist you. On behalf of the entire crew, I&rsquo;d like to thank you for joining us on this trip and we are looking forward to seeing you on board again in the near future. Have a nice stay!&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone clapped as the plane came to a stop, they all stood to grab their carry-ons, Peter and Y/N were still holding hands as they walked off the plane to the baggage claim. Y/N rested her head onto Peter&rsquo;s shoulder, grabbing their luggage they walked to Mr. Dell and Mrs. Warren, the rest of the class followed. Mrs. Warren did roll call once again and once she noted everyone was there, they went outside and into the bus. No one was talking, just wanted to get to the hotel and sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>They all piled off the bus, Mr. Dell giving out room keys and listing their roommates, Peter was rooming with Ned and MJ was rooming with Y/N. Peter and Ned&rsquo;s room was at the end of the hall to the right, while MJ&rsquo;s and Y/N&rsquo;s was to the right, they all said goodnight and entered their rooms. Y/N went straight to the restroom, brushed her teeth, changed and plopped on the bed. MJ did the same.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we have to be down there at 8. I just wanna have a lazy day tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same,&rdquo; MJ replied Y/N opened her carry on and pulled out Stitch.</p><p>&ldquo;Night MJ.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night Y/N.&rdquo; the room went dark and so did their worlds.</p><p><b>Tags:</b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mic7Wka-xzCrLKU1pBbb0PQ\">@ziggyspurplehaze</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpNDHuGb1om0DiJAPoJWECA\">@ghost-brocolli</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBYZXaBmOngftAlUtwDspg\">@a-sweet-little-fangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIh3QlH_jDwMU00n6iB2U9Q\">@imafreakingtaco</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM2SqDZ_e-Qwi-xn76tnhmQ\">@karlitabi-rrito</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/migFl6qyS_ElmNb7KIV7hzA\">@rexorangecounty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9HZpJnCKVuzrTEDDbeIJ2w\">@outsider-underwater</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\">@alisoncdariel</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsBbKFE4RTQxuIRv2X79XA\">@too-involved</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-mEsGpzinOJ73JoDtl-0mA\">@laurxn-robinson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOroj3oz1Do0GJ7pk5TBMVQ\">@princessdancingonthesunshine</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqa5AUG1riofOAx5btyyOuw\">@eridanuswave</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpNUrTHrwzL7sPkzm6PMlHw\">@readixgkodie615</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYCJSiMzHZpcL663KFPwnPw\">@sltwins</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meC_KdLIMpr5o7nkSFQCP2Q\">@xjaelee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvsUDiSHXfMVFqNDVFrgSyg\">@peruvian-bae</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNCiTa-l8_9SUgSKKIUp-mQ\">@aestheticgaybish</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtJ40bwnGOBD9DlwSaWnAvg\">@gwil-myee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-NJH4jRBVgFUCthPZ5bRNg\">@editsbyjenny</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mInmW01Oaqfo0V1sN8GlfAg\">@soniasalvatore1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlaBaCfZTA6RVQKL1I3tV2Q\">@avnngrs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mySgn3xtGf7x7EUH7iJiG3Q\">@lifestragedy</a> </b></p>",

Ok.&rdquo; Pepper made her way into Y/N&rsquo;s room expecting to see Peter and her asleep wrapped in a blanket but instead, she saw an empty bed, blankets gone. Pepper&rsquo;s eyes widened, breath hitched quickly she checked the drawers, slightly feeling relieved when the clothes were still there. Pepper made her way down the stairs opening the front door she saw the two teenagers laying on the dock. Pepper quietly made her way towards them, seeing dried tears on their cheeks, faces are swollen, Peter&rsquo;s head rested on Y/N&rsquo;s chest; arms firmly wrapped around her waist. Y/Ns hand remained in Peter&rsquo;s hair, slight smiles appeared on their faces. Pepper couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the two, she walked away careful not to wake them.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;May?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did you find him?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s here. He fell asleep with Y/N.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh thank god.

I almost didn\u2019t notice this is something he would ever wear, but I didn\u2019t care. </p><p>He wrapped his arms around my body hugging me close, he kissed my forehead petting my hair.

I just got back from the mission with the avengers&hellip;\u201d what the hell? Was I just suddenly pulled back into time?

You immediately thought he was cute. The way his eyebrows knitted\ntogether and his tongue slightly stuck out between his lips. You pushed that to\nthe back of your mind, however, when you realized that said cute boy is a\ncomplete stranger and is in <i>your father\u2019s </i>lab. \u201cWho the hell are you!?\nAnd what do you think you\u2019re doing in here?\u201d The brown-haired boy jumps, almost\nsending whatever tool he had in his hand flying through the air. His eyes dart\naround for a few moments, obviously unaware of where you are in the room. When\nhe finds you, however, his eyes lock onto yours and he visibly gulps.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m\nP-Peter,\u201d he sputters out. You raise your eyebrows and nod your head, signaling\nfor him to continue his explanation. Instead, he just opens and closes his\nmouth a few times without getting a word out.</p><p> \u201cAlright,\n\u2018Peter,\u2019\u201d you emphasize his alleged name with air quotes, \u201cI\u2019m calling\nsecurity.\u201d At that, he jumps from his stool and quickly shuffles over to you.\nYou back away from him cautiously. If this kid can get into a high-security\nfacility, who knows what else he\u2019s capable of.</p><p> \u201cW-wait,\nplease. I-I\u2019m a personal assistant to-to Mr. Stark.\u201d You had never even seen\nthis boy before, let alone met him!

The two of\nyou are walking through Central Park, fingers laced together and arms swinging\nback and forth like little kids. Peter holds a milkshake in his other hand,\nbringing the straw to his lips for a drink every now and again before offering\nit to you for a sip. The air is starting to get cooler, signaling the oncoming\nautumn. You glance down at your sweatshirt, one of Peter\u2019s comfy blue Midtown\nones, and feel your cheeks heat up again from wearing your boyfriend\u2019s clothes.\nThe intimacy of it all still has you reeling.</p><p>\u201cPetey\u2026\u201d you begin. He makes a\n\u201chmm\u201d noise around the straw, indicating that he\u2019s paying attention. You gently\npull him to a stop and encircle his torso with your arms. He moves the cup away\nfrom his face and you take the opportunity to nuzzle into the crook of his\nneck. \u201cToday has been absolutely amazing. Thank you so much.\u201d Peter chuckles\nlightly, wrapping his arms around your back.</p><p>\u201cI had a really great time today\ntoo,\u201d he mumbles into your hair. \u201cListen\u2026(Y/N)\u2026there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been\nwanting to tell you for a while now, and\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026I don\u2019t know, now feels like\na good time\u2026\u201d You lift your head to look him in the eyes, ready to hear\nwhatever he has to say when you feel something wet hit your nose. You look up\nat the sky, suddenly dark and overcast. As if on cue, thunder rumbles in the\ndistance and rain starts to cascade down from the sky.</p><p> \u201cShit, we\ndon\u2019t have an umbrella,\u201d you squeak out. Peter looks around quickly, grabbing\nyour hand and leading you to a nearby pagoda. The rain intensifies, turning\ninto more of a torrential downpour. \u201cIf I had my watch, I could just activate\nmy suit and fly us to the tower. You don\u2019t have any of your gear, do you?\u201d\nPeter shakes his head \u2018no,\u2019 which makes you groan out a defeated sigh.\n\u201cAlright, the tower isn\u2019t <i>too </i>far away. We can just make a run for it.\u201d\nYou look at him for confirmation and, with one last look at the sheets of water\ncoming down, Peter reluctantly agrees.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0umAsus1wch7v7_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>Despite your best efforts, by the time you make it through\nthe back entrance of the tower, you\u2019re both soaked from head to toe. The two of\nyou take the elevator up to the penthouse, which is still filled with boxes and\ncrates of stuff that have to be moved upstate. \u201cMy dad made sure to have me\nleave some emergency clothes and stuff like that here, just in case.\u201d You enter\nyour old room, making your way over to the large connected closet; the small\namount of clothes left seem comical in such a large space. You pick out some\nnew clothes for yourself and throw some to Peter as well as a towel to dry off\nwith. Neither of you had seen each other naked yet and, due to your scars, you\nsuggest Peter change in your room while you stay in the closet to do so. He\nobliges your wish and leaves without saying a word.</p><p> You take\nyour time pulling off the damp clothes, reveling in the feeling of them no\nlonger sticking to your skin. You dry off and slip into a fresh, dry pair of\nunderwear and pants. You pick up the shirt you selected, ready to pull it on\nover your head, when your feel hands rest at your waist. You yelp out of\nsurprise and spin around, almost falling over in the process. Peter\u2019s laugh,\nwhich you usually find so melodic and beautiful, now makes you blood boil. Said\nlaughter is soon cut short, however, when he glances down at your chest. Now\nrealizing how exposed you are, you quickly fumble to cover up your torso with\nthe shirt. Peter\u2019s eyebrows knit together and his head cocks to the side\nslightly.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026what\nhappened?\u201d You can hear the slight worry laced in his voice.</p><p> \u201cWhat?\nN-nothing! W-why\u2026why would you think something happened!?\u201d The explicit panic\nin your voice doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.</p><p> \u201cBecause\nyou have scars on your chest.\u201d He moves closer to you, reaching out to try and\ngrab the shirt. You recede from him, your bare back meeting the cold wall. You\nalmost regret the move, however, from the hurt look plastered on Peter\u2019s face.</p><p> \u201cNo! No,\nthis isn\u2019t how I wanted you to find out!\u201d You yell more towards yourself than\nthe other boy. He reaches out again, and while you tense up, you relax at the\nfelling of his hand lightly gripping your shoulder.</p><p> \u201cFind out\nwhat, baby? Come on, you\u2019re scaring me!\u201d The amount of desperation that rings\nthrough tugs at your heartstrings. A million thoughts begin to race through\nyour mind. Should you tell him the truth? Should you try to find a way to\nweasel out of the conversation? Should you break things off with Peter before\nhe has the chance to?</p><p> Drawing out\na sigh, you slowly lower the shirt, revealing your torso and the scars about an\ninch below your nipples. Peter\u2019s eyes are fixated on them, causing you to\nretreat in on yourself out of self-consciousness. He trails his hand down your\nshoulder, looking into your eyes for permission before ghosting his fingertips\nover top the raised flesh. You feel tears start to prick at your eyes as he\ncontinues to concentrate on them. You try, and fail, to stifle a sob, which\nmakes Peter\u2019s eyes snap back up to yours. His deep brown doe-eyes still swim\nwith concern, the sight making you tear up even more.</p><p> Your crying\nescalates to light sobbing, which Peter takes as his cue to pull you into his\nchest, holding you in his way-too-strong-for-his-size arms. The two of you\nslowly sink down to the carpeted floor, him helping you the way down. \u201cI-I\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d you choke out. He tightens his grip on you, one of his hands tangling\nitself in your hair.</p><p> \u201cYou have\nnothing to be sorry about,\u201d his tender tone only exacerbates your sobbing. For\nthe next few minutes, Peter just holds you while you cry. Neither of you make\nan attempt to move and the only noises are your sobs and Peter\u2019s quiet whispers\nof sweet nothings. After your crying calms down to mild sniffles, Peter pulls\naway from you and immediately places his hands on either side of your face. He\nwipes away the leftover tears with his thumbs and cracks his gorgeous smile\nwhen you finally meet his eyes.</p><p> \u201cThere\u2019s my\nbeautiful boy\u2026\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026I\u2019m\nnot\u2026I mean\u2026I wasn\u2019t born\u2026\u201d Peter places a finger on your lips, shaking his head\nfrom side to side.</p><p> \u201c(Y/N), I\ndon\u2019t care what you were \u2018born as.\u2019 You\u2019re you and you\u2019re the amazing, wonderful,\ngorgeous <i>boy </i>that I\u2026the boy that I f-fell in love with.\u201d Your eyes widen\nas the last few words leave his mouth. \u201cGod\u2026I just\u2026\u201d He looks down for a moment\nbefore gazing back into your eyes. He cups your face with his hands again, an\nact which you absolutely love, and gingerly places his lips against yours. You\nwrap your arms around his neck, deepening the kiss. Before you can properly\nmake out, however, he pulls away from you. He rests his forehead against yours\nand breathes in a shaky breath. \u201c(Y/N)\u2026I-I\u2019ve been wanting to tell you that,\nfor a while now.\u201d</p><p> You caress\nhis left cheek before pulling away from him, gazing into his gorgeous eyes\nagain. \u201cPeter\u2026I-I\u2019m also\u2026in love with you.\u201d He smiles, exposing his pearly\nwhite teeth. \u201cWait, is that what you wanted to tell me back in Central Park?\u201d\nYou suddenly remembered your conversation from before that the rain so rudely\ninterrupted. He looks down, capturing your hand in his and holding it. He\nfinally raises his head back up, meeting your eyes again and nodding\nsheepishly.</p><p>\n\nYou can\u2019t help the smile that breaks out across\nyour face as you wrap your arms around his shoulders, pulling him into\nyourself. An unexplainable warmth radiates throughout your body as he\nreciprocates the embrace, holding you just as tightly as you\u2019re holding onto\nhim. You get the distinct feeling that this is just the beginning for the love\nstory of (Y/N) Stark and Peter Parker. Who knows where that story will take\nyou? <br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0w1MuiN1wch7v7_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><b>A/N:</b> Thanks again to all of you for your requests for this writing challenge.

You feel tears start to prick at your eyes as he\ncontinues to concentrate on them. You try, and fail, to stifle a sob, which\nmakes Peter\u2019s eyes snap back up to yours. His deep brown doe-eyes still swim\nwith concern, the sight making you tear up even more.</p><p> Your crying\nescalates to light sobbing, which Peter takes as his cue to pull you into his\nchest, holding you in his way-too-strong-for-his-size arms. The two of you\nslowly sink down to the carpeted floor, him helping you the way down. \u201cI-I\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d you choke out.

For\nthe next few minutes, Peter just holds you while you cry. Neither of you make\nan attempt to move and the only noises are your sobs and Peter\u2019s quiet whispers\nof sweet nothings. After your crying calms down to mild sniffles, Peter pulls\naway from you and immediately places his hands on either side of your face.

An unexplainable warmth radiates throughout your body as he\nreciprocates the embrace, holding you just as tightly as you\u2019re holding onto\nhim.

In conclusion, trans people are beautiful and I hope that I didn\u2019t slaughter this. \u2764\ufe0f Jerod<br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"315\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45d46f70d188ed6f712fafb2296469bb/tumblr_inline_ptu0n6UQ3T1wch7v7_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"315\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>The first time you saw Peter Parker was in your dad\u2019s lab.\nHe was busy tinkering away at something, all of his concentration thrown into\nhis work. You immediately thought he was cute. The way his eyebrows knitted\ntogether and his tongue slightly stuck out between his lips. You pushed that to\nthe back of your mind, however, when you realized that said cute boy is a\ncomplete stranger and is in <i>your father\u2019s </i>lab. \u201cWho the hell are you!?\nAnd what do you think you\u2019re doing in here?\u201d The brown-haired boy jumps, almost\nsending whatever tool he had in his hand flying through the air. His eyes dart\naround for a few moments, obviously unaware of where you are in the room. When\nhe finds you, however, his eyes lock onto yours and he visibly gulps.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m\nP-Peter,\u201d he sputters out. You raise your eyebrows and nod your head, signaling\nfor him to continue his explanation. Instead, he just opens and closes his\nmouth a few times without getting a word out.</p><p> \u201cAlright,\n\u2018Peter,\u2019\u201d you emphasize his alleged name with air quotes, \u201cI\u2019m calling\nsecurity.\u201d At that, he jumps from his stool and quickly shuffles over to you.\nYou back away from him cautiously. If this kid can get into a high-security\nfacility, who knows what else he\u2019s capable of.</p><p> \u201cW-wait,\nplease. I-I\u2019m a personal assistant to-to Mr. Stark.\u201d You had never even seen\nthis boy before, let alone met him! How could he possibly be a \u201cpersonal\nassistant\u201d to your father.</p><p> \u201cYyyeeeaaahhh\u2026okay.\nCome any closer to me and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d Your father had made you your own\nversion of an Iron Man suit. With the latest nanite tech, it\u2019s able to be\ndeployed from your watch. You shuffle threw a few options on said piece of\njewelry before finding the one you need and call every security officer nearby\nto your position. Before any of them can get there, however, your father flies\nin through the roof hatch, landing on the pad beneath it. His helmet\nde-materializes, revealing his worried face.</p><p> \u201c(Y/N),\nwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he questions urgently. You point to the boy standing in front of\nyou, his head now hung low. You side-step around him and make your way closer\nto your father.</p><p> \u201cDad!\u201d you\nsay somewhat stupefied.</p><p> \u201cDad!?\u201d the\nother boy blurts out, obviously surprised. You shoot a deadly glare his way\nbefore turning your attention back to your father.</p><p> \u201cThere\u2019s an\nintruder in your own lab, and you\u2019re asking what\u2019s wrong!?\u201d Your father looks\nbetween you and the other boy before bursting out into laughter. \u201cWhy is this\nfunny to you!?\u201d</p><p> \u201cM-Mr.\nStark, I\u2019m sorry. I tried telling him I\u2019m your personal assistant, but he\ndidn\u2019t believe me, and\u2026\u201d the other boy is cut off by your dad raising his hand.\nHe takes a few breaths, collecting himself after his outburst.</p><p>\n\n \u201c(Y/N),\nmeet Peter Parker. Peter, meet my son (Y/N).\u201d <br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0to6w6W1wch7v7_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>You felt bad for almost having Peter arrested and offered to\nlet you make it up to him by taking him out for lunch and a movie. He\nreluctantly accepted and the two of you had so much fun that you almost\ninstantly became best friends. A few months later, you confessed you had\nfeelings for each other and started dating.</p><p>You tell Peter everything\u2026well,\neverything except for the fact you were not born a male. You were born as Hope\nStark, a girl. You told your father that you were actually a boy when you were\nfourteen. He took it so well, saying that if you were sure you were born the\nwrong gender, he would help you with your transition. You had had top surgery\nabout six months before you met Peter. Your father recently came up with a\ncompound that will almost completely erase your scars, but it\u2019s still in the\nfinal testing phase and he has forbidden you from using it until he\u2019s 100% sure\nit\u2019s okay.</p><p>\n\nBecause of your oh-so-obvious scars, you refuse\nto take off your shirt around Peter. The only way that that could end is with\nthe very conversation you want to avoid. You know that if you\u2019re going to be\nwith him long-term, you\u2019ll have to tell him eventually, but you don\u2019t think you\ncan risk the possibility that he\u2019d reject you. The very idea of losing Peter\nmakes your insides feel like they are being wrung out.\n\n\n\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0u4LRDH1wch7v7_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Today is Saturday, and since the\nwhole Spider-Man business has been slow lately and your father doesn\u2019t need his\nhelp, you get to spend the entire day with your amazing boyfriend. The two of\nyou are walking through Central Park, fingers laced together and arms swinging\nback and forth like little kids. Peter holds a milkshake in his other hand,\nbringing the straw to his lips for a drink every now and again before offering\nit to you for a sip. The air is starting to get cooler, signaling the oncoming\nautumn. You glance down at your sweatshirt, one of Peter\u2019s comfy blue Midtown\nones, and feel your cheeks heat up again from wearing your boyfriend\u2019s clothes.\nThe intimacy of it all still has you reeling.</p><p>\u201cPetey\u2026\u201d you begin. He makes a\n\u201chmm\u201d noise around the straw, indicating that he\u2019s paying attention. You gently\npull him to a stop and encircle his torso with your arms. He moves the cup away\nfrom his face and you take the opportunity to nuzzle into the crook of his\nneck. \u201cToday has been absolutely amazing. Thank you so much.\u201d Peter chuckles\nlightly, wrapping his arms around your back.</p><p>\u201cI had a really great time today\ntoo,\u201d he mumbles into your hair. \u201cListen\u2026(Y/N)\u2026there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been\nwanting to tell you for a while now, and\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026I don\u2019t know, now feels like\na good time\u2026\u201d You lift your head to look him in the eyes, ready to hear\nwhatever he has to say when you feel something wet hit your nose. You look up\nat the sky, suddenly dark and overcast. As if on cue, thunder rumbles in the\ndistance and rain starts to cascade down from the sky.</p><p> \u201cShit, we\ndon\u2019t have an umbrella,\u201d you squeak out. Peter looks around quickly, grabbing\nyour hand and leading you to a nearby pagoda. The rain intensifies, turning\ninto more of a torrential downpour. \u201cIf I had my watch, I could just activate\nmy suit and fly us to the tower. You don\u2019t have any of your gear, do you?\u201d\nPeter shakes his head \u2018no,\u2019 which makes you groan out a defeated sigh.\n\u201cAlright, the tower isn\u2019t <i>too </i>far away. We can just make a run for it.\u201d\nYou look at him for confirmation and, with one last look at the sheets of water\ncoming down, Peter reluctantly agrees.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0umAsus1wch7v7_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"40\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Despite your best efforts, by the time you make it through\nthe back entrance of the tower, you\u2019re both soaked from head to toe. The two of\nyou take the elevator up to the penthouse, which is still filled with boxes and\ncrates of stuff that have to be moved upstate. \u201cMy dad made sure to have me\nleave some emergency clothes and stuff like that here, just in case.\u201d You enter\nyour old room, making your way over to the large connected closet; the small\namount of clothes left seem comical in such a large space. You pick out some\nnew clothes for yourself and throw some to Peter as well as a towel to dry off\nwith. Neither of you had seen each other naked yet and, due to your scars, you\nsuggest Peter change in your room while you stay in the closet to do so. He\nobliges your wish and leaves without saying a word.</p><p> You take\nyour time pulling off the damp clothes, reveling in the feeling of them no\nlonger sticking to your skin. You dry off and slip into a fresh, dry pair of\nunderwear and pants. You pick up the shirt you selected, ready to pull it on\nover your head, when your feel hands rest at your waist. You yelp out of\nsurprise and spin around, almost falling over in the process. Peter\u2019s laugh,\nwhich you usually find so melodic and beautiful, now makes you blood boil. Said\nlaughter is soon cut short, however, when he glances down at your chest. Now\nrealizing how exposed you are, you quickly fumble to cover up your torso with\nthe shirt. Peter\u2019s eyebrows knit together and his head cocks to the side\nslightly.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026what\nhappened?\u201d You can hear the slight worry laced in his voice.</p><p> \u201cWhat?\nN-nothing! W-why\u2026why would you think something happened!?\u201d The explicit panic\nin your voice doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.</p><p> \u201cBecause\nyou have scars on your chest.\u201d He moves closer to you, reaching out to try and\ngrab the shirt. You recede from him, your bare back meeting the cold wall. You\nalmost regret the move, however, from the hurt look plastered on Peter\u2019s face.</p><p> \u201cNo! No,\nthis isn\u2019t how I wanted you to find out!\u201d You yell more towards yourself than\nthe other boy. He reaches out again, and while you tense up, you relax at the\nfelling of his hand lightly gripping your shoulder.</p><p> \u201cFind out\nwhat, baby? Come on, you\u2019re scaring me!\u201d The amount of desperation that rings\nthrough tugs at your heartstrings. A million thoughts begin to race through\nyour mind. Should you tell him the truth? Should you try to find a way to\nweasel out of the conversation? Should you break things off with Peter before\nhe has the chance to?</p><p> Drawing out\na sigh, you slowly lower the shirt, revealing your torso and the scars about an\ninch below your nipples. Peter\u2019s eyes are fixated on them, causing you to\nretreat in on yourself out of self-consciousness. He trails his hand down your\nshoulder, looking into your eyes for permission before ghosting his fingertips\nover top the raised flesh. You feel tears start to prick at your eyes as he\ncontinues to concentrate on them. You try, and fail, to stifle a sob, which\nmakes Peter\u2019s eyes snap back up to yours.

Instead, he just opens and closes his\nmouth a few times without getting a word out.</p><p> &ldquo;Alright,\n&lsquo;Peter,&rsquo;&rdquo; you emphasize his alleged name with air quotes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling\nsecurity.&rdquo; At that, he jumps from his stool and quickly shuffles over to you.\nYou back away from him cautiously. If this kid can get into a high-security\nfacility, who knows what else he&rsquo;s capable of.</p><p> &ldquo;W-wait,\nplease. I-I&rsquo;m a personal assistant to-to Mr. Stark.&rdquo; You had never even seen\nthis boy before, let alone met him! How could he possibly be a &ldquo;personal\nassistant&rdquo; to your father.</p><p> &ldquo;Yyyeeeaaahhh&hellip;okay.\nCome any closer to me and you&rsquo;ll regret it.&rdquo; Your father had made you your own\nversion of an Iron Man suit. With the latest nanite tech, it&rsquo;s able to be\ndeployed from your watch. You shuffle threw a few options on said piece of\njewelry before finding the one you need and call every security officer nearby\nto your position. Before any of them can get there, however, your father flies\nin through the roof hatch, landing on the pad beneath it. His helmet\nde-materializes, revealing his worried face.</p><p> &ldquo;(Y/N),\nwhat&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he questions urgently. You point to the boy standing in front of\nyou, his head now hung low. You side-step around him and make your way closer\nto your father.</p><p> &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; you\nsay somewhat stupefied.</p><p> &ldquo;Dad!?&rdquo; the\nother boy blurts out, obviously surprised. You shoot a deadly glare his way\nbefore turning your attention back to your father.</p><p> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an\nintruder in your own lab, and you&rsquo;re asking what&rsquo;s wrong!?&rdquo; Your father looks\nbetween you and the other boy before bursting out into laughter. &ldquo;Why is this\nfunny to you!?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;M-Mr.\nStark, I&rsquo;m sorry. I tried telling him I&rsquo;m your personal assistant, but he\ndidn&rsquo;t believe me, and&hellip;&rdquo; the other boy is cut off by your dad raising his hand.\nHe takes a few breaths, collecting himself after his outburst.</p><p>\n\n &ldquo;(Y/N),\nmeet Peter Parker. Peter, meet my son (Y/N).&rdquo; <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0to6w6W1wch7v7_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You felt bad for almost having Peter arrested and offered to\nlet you make it up to him by taking him out for lunch and a movie. He\nreluctantly accepted and the two of you had so much fun that you almost\ninstantly became best friends. A few months later, you confessed you had\nfeelings for each other and started dating.</p><p>You tell Peter everything&hellip;well,\neverything except for the fact you were not born a male. You were born as Hope\nStark, a girl. You told your father that you were actually a boy when you were\nfourteen. He took it so well, saying that if you were sure you were born the\nwrong gender, he would help you with your transition. You had had top surgery\nabout six months before you met Peter. Your father recently came up with a\ncompound that will almost completely erase your scars, but it&rsquo;s still in the\nfinal testing phase and he has forbidden you from using it until he&rsquo;s 100% sure\nit&rsquo;s okay.</p><p>\n\nBecause of your oh-so-obvious scars, you refuse\nto take off your shirt around Peter. The only way that that could end is with\nthe very conversation you want to avoid. You know that if you&rsquo;re going to be\nwith him long-term, you&rsquo;ll have to tell him eventually, but you don&rsquo;t think you\ncan risk the possibility that he&rsquo;d reject you. The very idea of losing Peter\nmakes your insides feel like they are being wrung out.\n\n\n\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0u4LRDH1wch7v7_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Today is Saturday, and since the\nwhole Spider-Man business has been slow lately and your father doesn&rsquo;t need his\nhelp, you get to spend the entire day with your amazing boyfriend. The two of\nyou are walking through Central Park, fingers laced together and arms swinging\nback and forth like little kids. Peter holds a milkshake in his other hand,\nbringing the straw to his lips for a drink every now and again before offering\nit to you for a sip. The air is starting to get cooler, signaling the oncoming\nautumn. You glance down at your sweatshirt, one of Peter&rsquo;s comfy blue Midtown\nones, and feel your cheeks heat up again from wearing your boyfriend&rsquo;s clothes.\nThe intimacy of it all still has you reeling.</p><p>&ldquo;Petey&hellip;&rdquo; you begin. He makes a\n&ldquo;hmm&rdquo; noise around the straw, indicating that he&rsquo;s paying attention. You gently\npull him to a stop and encircle his torso with your arms. He moves the cup away\nfrom his face and you take the opportunity to nuzzle into the crook of his\nneck. &ldquo;Today has been absolutely amazing. Thank you so much.&rdquo; Peter chuckles\nlightly, wrapping his arms around your back.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a really great time today\ntoo,&rdquo; he mumbles into your hair. &ldquo;Listen&hellip;(Y/N)&hellip;there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been\nwanting to tell you for a while now, and&hellip;it&rsquo;s just&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know, now feels like\na good time&hellip;&rdquo; You lift your head to look him in the eyes, ready to hear\nwhatever he has to say when you feel something wet hit your nose. You look up\nat the sky, suddenly dark and overcast. As if on cue, thunder rumbles in the\ndistance and rain starts to cascade down from the sky.</p><p> &ldquo;Shit, we\ndon&rsquo;t have an umbrella,&rdquo; you squeak out. Peter looks around quickly, grabbing\nyour hand and leading you to a nearby pagoda. The rain intensifies, turning\ninto more of a torrential downpour. &ldquo;If I had my watch, I could just activate\nmy suit and fly us to the tower. You don&rsquo;t have any of your gear, do you?&rdquo;\nPeter shakes his head &lsquo;no,&rsquo; which makes you groan out a defeated sigh.\n&ldquo;Alright, the tower isn&rsquo;t <i>too </i>far away. We can just make a run for it.&rdquo;\nYou look at him for confirmation and, with one last look at the sheets of water\ncoming down, Peter reluctantly agrees.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0umAsus1wch7v7_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Despite your best efforts, by the time you make it through\nthe back entrance of the tower, you&rsquo;re both soaked from head to toe. The two of\nyou take the elevator up to the penthouse, which is still filled with boxes and\ncrates of stuff that have to be moved upstate. &ldquo;My dad made sure to have me\nleave some emergency clothes and stuff like that here, just in case.&rdquo; You enter\nyour old room, making your way over to the large connected closet; the small\namount of clothes left seem comical in such a large space. You pick out some\nnew clothes for yourself and throw some to Peter as well as a towel to dry off\nwith. Neither of you had seen each other naked yet and, due to your scars, you\nsuggest Peter change in your room while you stay in the closet to do so. He\nobliges your wish and leaves without saying a word.</p><p> You take\nyour time pulling off the damp clothes, reveling in the feeling of them no\nlonger sticking to your skin. You dry off and slip into a fresh, dry pair of\nunderwear and pants. You pick up the shirt you selected, ready to pull it on\nover your head, when your feel hands rest at your waist. You yelp out of\nsurprise and spin around, almost falling over in the process. Peter&rsquo;s laugh,\nwhich you usually find so melodic and beautiful, now makes you blood boil. Said\nlaughter is soon cut short, however, when he glances down at your chest. Now\nrealizing how exposed you are, you quickly fumble to cover up your torso with\nthe shirt. Peter&rsquo;s eyebrows knit together and his head cocks to the side\nslightly.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)&hellip;what\nhappened?&rdquo; You can hear the slight worry laced in his voice.</p><p> &ldquo;What?\nN-nothing! W-why&hellip;why would you think something happened!?&rdquo; The explicit panic\nin your voice doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed.</p><p> &ldquo;Because\nyou have scars on your chest.&rdquo; He moves closer to you, reaching out to try and\ngrab the shirt. You recede from him, your bare back meeting the cold wall. You\nalmost regret the move, however, from the hurt look plastered on Peter&rsquo;s face.</p><p> &ldquo;No! No,\nthis isn&rsquo;t how I wanted you to find out!&rdquo; You yell more towards yourself than\nthe other boy. He reaches out again, and while you tense up, you relax at the\nfelling of his hand lightly gripping your shoulder.</p><p> &ldquo;Find out\nwhat, baby? Come on, you&rsquo;re scaring me!&rdquo; The amount of desperation that rings\nthrough tugs at your heartstrings. A million thoughts begin to race through\nyour mind. Should you tell him the truth? Should you try to find a way to\nweasel out of the conversation? Should you break things off with Peter before\nhe has the chance to?</p><p> Drawing out\na sigh, you slowly lower the shirt, revealing your torso and the scars about an\ninch below your nipples. Peter&rsquo;s eyes are fixated on them, causing you to\nretreat in on yourself out of self-consciousness. He trails his hand down your\nshoulder, looking into your eyes for permission before ghosting his fingertips\nover top the raised flesh. You feel tears start to prick at your eyes as he\ncontinues to concentrate on them. You try, and fail, to stifle a sob, which\nmakes Peter&rsquo;s eyes snap back up to yours. His deep brown doe-eyes still swim\nwith concern, the sight making you tear up even more.</p><p> Your crying\nescalates to light sobbing, which Peter takes as his cue to pull you into his\nchest, holding you in his way-too-strong-for-his-size arms. The two of you\nslowly sink down to the carpeted floor, him helping you the way down. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m\nsorry,&rdquo; you choke out. He tightens his grip on you, one of his hands tangling\nitself in your hair.</p><p> &ldquo;You have\nnothing to be sorry about,&rdquo; his tender tone only exacerbates your sobbing. For\nthe next few minutes, Peter just holds you while you cry. Neither of you make\nan attempt to move and the only noises are your sobs and Peter&rsquo;s quiet whispers\nof sweet nothings. After your crying calms down to mild sniffles, Peter pulls\naway from you and immediately places his hands on either side of your face. He\nwipes away the leftover tears with his thumbs and cracks his gorgeous smile\nwhen you finally meet his eyes.</p><p> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my\nbeautiful boy&hellip;&rdquo; he whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter&hellip;I&rsquo;m\nnot&hellip;I mean&hellip;I wasn&rsquo;t born&hellip;&rdquo; Peter places a finger on your lips, shaking his head\nfrom side to side.</p><p> &ldquo;(Y/N), I\ndon&rsquo;t care what you were &lsquo;born as.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re you and you&rsquo;re the amazing, wonderful,\ngorgeous <i>boy </i>that I&hellip;the boy that I f-fell in love with.&rdquo; Your eyes widen\nas the last few words leave his mouth. &ldquo;God&hellip;I just&hellip;&rdquo; He looks down for a moment\nbefore gazing back into your eyes. He cups your face with his hands again, an\nact which you absolutely love, and gingerly places his lips against yours. You\nwrap your arms around his neck, deepening the kiss. Before you can properly\nmake out, however, he pulls away from you. He rests his forehead against yours\nand breathes in a shaky breath. &ldquo;(Y/N)&hellip;I-I&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you that,\nfor a while now.&rdquo;</p><p> You caress\nhis left cheek before pulling away from him, gazing into his gorgeous eyes\nagain. &ldquo;Peter&hellip;I-I&rsquo;m also&hellip;in love with you.&rdquo; He smiles, exposing his pearly\nwhite teeth. &ldquo;Wait, is that what you wanted to tell me back in Central Park?&rdquo;\nYou suddenly remembered your conversation from before that the rain so rudely\ninterrupted. He looks down, capturing your hand in his and holding it. He\nfinally raises his head back up, meeting your eyes again and nodding\nsheepishly.</p><p>\n\nYou can&rsquo;t help the smile that breaks out across\nyour face as you wrap your arms around his shoulders, pulling him into\nyourself. An unexplainable warmth radiates throughout your body as he\nreciprocates the embrace, holding you just as tightly as you&rsquo;re holding onto\nhim. You get the distinct feeling that this is just the beginning for the love\nstory of (Y/N) Stark and Peter Parker. Who knows where that story will take\nyou? <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00b52d315fb45ade8ae1297d5a12a4db/tumblr_inline_ptu0w1MuiN1wch7v7_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>A/N:</b> Thanks again to all of you for your requests for this writing challenge.

MJ, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t in this class with you and you didn\u2019t enjoy that you would have to leave your best friend alone in school. This was one class you shared with Peter and Ned and didn\u2019t know what to expect, considering your weird encounter with Peter.</p><p>When you walked into class, he nodded in your direction and you gave him a petite wave. Ned gestured for you to sit at the combined table with him and sat in front of the two teenagers as everyone shuffled in.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to Stark Tower,\u201d Ned said out of excitement. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as cool as you think it is,\u201d Peter said casually. \u201cIt\u2019s more businessmen and businesswomen more than Avengers, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d you asked Peter.</p><!-- more --><p>His eyes widened. \u201cOh, uh, my internship! Yeah, I intern for Stark Industries and I\u2019ve met the Avengers a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d you said with a gentle smile. \u201cTony seems like a nice person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nicest,\u201d Peter said with a knowing grin.</p><p>You thought about how the field trip would be absolutely redundant considering you had just gotten an extensive tour from Steve Rogers himself, but you were excited to learn more about career paths in an environment you wanted to work in.</p><p>\u201cOkay, class!\u201d Your teacher announced. \u201cRelease forms and liability papers are being passed around. It\u2019s important you get this to me by Thursday the latest if you want to go on this field trip. For the rest of the class period, you can treat this as a study hall.\u201d</p><p>You emitted a sigh and you were internally grateful for this chance to catch up on homework. Due to your late night rendezvous with Spider-Man and your <i>many</i> trips to Stark Tower, you ended up staying up until two in the morning finishing homework for the next school day. </p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll see any Avengers?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d said Peter.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s cool,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to meet an Avenger.\u201d</p><p>You missed this interaction, but Peter gave him a feigned annoyed expression and Ned chuckled at the fact that he had disregarded his best friend being Spider-Man.</p><p>\u201cI hope Spidey\u2019s there,\u201d you said casually as you punched numbers into your calculator. </p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d asked Peter.</p><p>\u201cOh, Spider-Man,\u201d you said, kicking yourself for using your nickname for him. \u201cI hope he\u2019s at the tower. I\u2019d, uh, I\u2019d really like to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really like Spider-Man, huh?\u201d Ned asked politely.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d you said with a sheepish grin. \u201cHe works under the radar and isn\u2019t in it for the fame. He\u2019s just really wholesome and pure, you know? Spider-Man cares for Queens and I couldn\u2019t ask someone better to look up to.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart was racing despite taking the relaxing pill Tony had given him and he knew it was because of the feelings for you he was trying to surpress. His heart, at that moment, wasn\u2019t beating fast because of his spidey senses but rather it was because he has internally admitted to himself that he liked you in a way he never thought possible.</p><p>He liked that you loved computer science and engineering. He liked that you were studious and wanted to get into a good college. He liked that you were mature for your age and had refrained from befriending Flash, despite Peter giving you ever reason to like him more. Most of all, Peter liked that you liked Spider-Man because that meant you liked him. </p><p>The only thing that made him nervous about liking you was not knowing how you\u2019d react to him being Spider-Man. He didn\u2019t know if you liked his alter ego for the fame that came with it or because you got to see a side of him no one else saw. Ned knew he was Spider-Man, sure, but Peter confided in you in a way he couldn\u2019t with Ned. </p><p>Peter was nervous and he was sure that things would work out in the end because if he learned anything from getting to know you, it was that you were understanding and patient. Worst of all, you both admitted to liking one another on your balcony a few nights prior. The tension was building up and Peter was the one who lifted his mask to his nose and press his lips against yours, and you weren\u2019t complaining. </p><p>Peter decided that for now, he wouldn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>When you arrived home, you pulled out the release form and wanted your mother to sign it before you forgot it on your bedroom desk and didn\u2019t want to turn it in too late.</p><p>\u201cHey, mom?\u201d you said as you entered her workspace. She didn\u2019t work from home every often but had a small office space that she used if she ever decided to bring her work home from her main office. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, sweet pea?\u201d she asked with a gentle tone before taking her glasses off and turning to you in the chair she sat in.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrington\u2019s taking us to Stark Tower and needs this permission slip signed by Thursday but I was hoping to get it in tomorrow. Can you sign it for me?\u201d</p><p>Your mother didn\u2019t miss a heartbeat. </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you anywhere near or inside of that tower.\u201d</p><p>You groaned. \u201cWell, why not? You know how much I want to work in the computer science field and this is an opportunity for me to learn more about a future career path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she said, standing up from her seat, \u201cI know this would be good for you but I don\u2019t feel like Stark Tower is the safest place for you to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? There will be so many Avengers in that tower and people who can fight for a living. I\u2019m sixteen and I\u2019m about to start my life really soon and this could be a good way to learn about what I can do for the world.\u201d</p><p>Your mother sighed and gave you a small smile, remembering all the moments you two shared as you grew up. She remembered the first time you touched a computer and decided that, while she didn\u2019t like the idea of going to the tower, there wasn\u2019t stopping you if it was to help your future.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to know I\u2019m advising you against this, but I\u2019ll sign it for you,\u201d she caved.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d you exclaimed as you sat the paper down flat on her desk. You mother heaved a sigh and wrote her signature on a clean line at the bottom before handing the slip back to you.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be extra careful when you\u2019re there,\u201d she said with a worried tone. You furrowed your eyebrows because when your mother got anxious, her tell was tapping her finger on a flat surface and her voice became an octave lower. This was one of those times.</p><p>\u201cI will, mom. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d she said. \u201cOf all the times I\u2019ve taught you life lessons and scolded you to be aware of your surroundings, I really mean it this time. There are some things you don\u2019t know about that could seriously hurt you.\u201d You gave your mother a reassuring hug.</p><p>\u201cI know, mom. There\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know about but I want to learn about them. I\u2019ll be careful, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She gave you a smile and let you to your bedroom to finish your homework, not knowing what she let you get into.</p><p>***</p><p>Before you had arrived to school on the day of the field trip, Peter was rocking back and forth between his legs and trying to stay still when Ned put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDude, are you okay?\u201d he asked. </p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know know why my senses are going off the charts but I can\u2019t seem to slow my heart rate down. The pills Mr. Stark gave me aren\u2019t working and I can\u2019t take another one unless I want to go into cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cWhat about that hunch you had with Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I thought that getting her go open up to me would solve it. She seemed pretty upset about her father and I thought that was the secret she had been keeping but it seems like there\u2019s something else going on with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me,\u201d said Peter. \u201cHere she comes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey Ned,\u201d you said. \u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re chirpy for seven-thirty,\u201d Ned snorted. \u201cI could barely get myself out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty excited, Peter,\u201d you said with a stifled laugh. You had accredited to his antsy-self as excitement but didn\u2019t know he was more nervous than excited.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d said Peter, playing along. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the tower when I\u2019m not working. That\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet! I\u2019m gonna head onto the bus,\u201d you said before walking into the yellow bus.</p><p>\u201cGo sit next to her. See if you can calm yourself down or find something that\u2019ll help you,\u201d Ned told you.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Peter replied. He wasn\u2019t exactly rejecting the idea of being right next to you. He saw you look mildly annoyed at your small shoulder bag when he approached. \u201cIs anyone sitting here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Um, no one\u2019s sitting here,\u201d you said, half paying attention. \u201cDang it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Peter asked as he took a seat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I left my headphones on my desk at home,\u201d you explained while shrugging. \u201cThis next forty-five minutes is gonna go by so slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left mine at home too,\u201d Peter lied, knowing he had left them in the Avenger common room yesterday. \u201cI guess we\u2019re both unlucky today.</p><p>You laughed. \u201cI guess so, Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any fun last weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your friend,\u201d Peter said, clearing his throat. \u201cYou mentioned you were seeing a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cIt was really fun, actually. He took me to this sandwich shop he likes and I are some pretty good food. I\u2019m sorry, you probably not want to hear that,\u201d you said, laughing as you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d Peter said with a genuine smile. \u201cI like it when you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>His statement, bold as ever, shocked you but you were determined to not show how shocked you were to avoid embarrassing yourself.  </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually really sweet of you to say, Peter. Well, we don\u2019t really do much other than hang out,\u201d you said, leaving out the part where he often meets you and Tony Stark in the tower you were headed to. \u201cHe\u2019s real nice. Gentle, even. That\u2019s not weird, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve found someone.\u201d</p><p>You paused. \u201cYou\u2019re being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, three weeks ago you practically ignoring me and now you\u2019re asking about my love life.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed nervously. \u201cNed helped shed some light on how I had been acting. I-I was a shit person to you and I\u2019m really sorry. I was going through some personal things in my life and couldn\u2019t handle another person knowing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>You nodded once and decided that you\u2019d let go of all animosity towards Peter and how you felt about him beforehand. The pent up emotions were let go as soon as you and Spider-Man had admitted feelings for one another and somehow, being around Peter reminded you of the masked hero. With that in mind, you decided that you\u2019d focus your energy and attention on anything but hating Peter Parker.</p><p>The rest of the ride was quite pleasant and you accredited that to letting your wall against Peter crumble down the minute you had felt completely comfortable being around him. It was weird \u2014 you know that there was no reason for you to trust him and yet you sat there feeling like you had known Peter, really know him. His \u2018energy\u2019 was familiar and it wasn\u2019t because you occasionally sat next to him during lunchtime. It wasn\u2019t because you hung out with him once with Ned. This was something else entirely and you weren\u2019t quite sure what it was. </p><p>When you arrived at Stark Tower, Mr. Harrington stood in front of the bus and urged everyone to be on their best behavior. You represented Midtown Tech, he reminded. Any of you could be working there in the future.</p><p>You filed out behind Ned and in front of Peter, who let you walk out the doors first. You looked at the familiar entrance and saw the usual bustling lobby you had grown accustomed to and the usual businessmen and businesswomen running late for meetings.  </p><p>The tour guide met your group by the front doors and \u2018debriefed\u2019 the lot about procedures, rules, and what to do if there\u2019s an emergency that needed to be handled. </p><p>\u201cWelcome to my building,\u201d Tony greeted. His eyes scanned over the crowd and was pleasantly surprised to see both your face and Peter\u2019s. \u201cI hope it\u2019s everything you expected and more.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of applause and happy murmurs were audible as Tony had granted access to a low level access laboratory that showcased what goes on in Stark Industry laboratories. The students milled around and looked at the people in white lab coats work on different projects (that were safe to be around, assured by Tony himself) and inspected daily work in the work space. Tony grinned at you when you caught his eye and saw that Natasha had snuck up to stand beside him. She gave you a wink and you gave her a shy wave before joining the rest of your class for the remaining portion of the tour.</p><p>\u201cThis is so neat,\u201d Ned whisper-yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you see this stuff every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot <i>every</i> day,\u201d Peter retorted. \u201cBut, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>Peter was itching to talk to Tony about the predicament he found himself in. His heart was beating much faster than when he was outside of the building but now it was spiking like there was no tomorrow. </p><p>He walked passed the students while trying to be discreet about needed to see Tony to talk to him about his senses and why they were going haywire more than usual. Yeah, Peter could sense if there was someone running behind him or when Ned was trying to sneak up on him, but this wasn\u2019t something he couldn\u2019t understand. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, kid,\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cCome back after school.\u201d Peter sighed but nodded, knowing he wasn\u2019t going to get anything out of Tony even if he tried. </p><p>The rest of the tour guide consisted of viewing Tony\u2019s private office, meeting other Avengers and visiting superheroes, and talking with different technical experts. It was when Thor showed up at the end of the tour that made the crowd buzz.</p><p>\u201cThor? I thought you were taking care of a project in Texas,\u201d Tony said, confused. </p><p>Thor chuckled. \u201cI got back a few minutes ago when Natasha told me Midtown Tech was visiting.\u201d He nodded his head at Peter, who laughed nervously. </p><p>\u201cHi Thor!\u201d you heard a girl from your group yell out. </p><p>You and Peter simultaneously rolled your eyes and shared a quiet laugh. </p><p>\u201cI was thinking you all could try to lift this old thing,\u201d he said while holding up Mjolnir. \u201cI doubt any of you could lift it but it\u2019ll be funny to see you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds entertaining,\u201d Tony said casually before looking at Mr. Harrington for permission, to which your teacher nodded out of both confusion and in awe. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set it down here,\u201d Thor said, putting Mjolnir in the middle of an unoccupied furnished room. \u201cSo, who wants to try first?\u201d Almost half of the class ran up to be first in line and made a makeshift queue. </p><p>\u201cYou gonna try?\u201d you asked Peter, leaning over to whisper.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll probably give it a go,\u201d he said, knowing he had already tried to pick up Mjolnir up several times. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d you replied. \u201cI know that nothing\u2019s going to happen but I really want to say I lifted the hammer at least once in my lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter! Watch me lift it!\u201d Ned shouted to grab Peter\u2019s attention. Peter laughed and watched as Ned struggled to lift the hammer and heaved a heavy sigh when he was unable to. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d said Ned. He shook his head in feigned disappointment. \u201cPeter, you should try!\u201d</p><p>Peter only laughed, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to pick it up. Thor patted Peter on the back and watched as another student failed to lift the hammer.</p><p>\u201cGood try,\u201d Thor commented. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Ned said in excitement. </p><p>You took a deep breath and felt that your palms were suddenly sweating, but shook the confusion out of your head and blamed your nervousness on the thirty odd pairs of eyes watching you at once. </p><p>But when your hands went to grip the black handles of the sacred hammer, your palms tingled and you felt a burning sensation against your skin and abruptly let go of it with a startled gasp. The room flickered as the room shook slightly before the power turned out, leaving a state of panic within the students in the room.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, turn the lights back on,\u201d said Tony.</p><p>\u201cWorking on turning the backup generator as we speak,\u201d she replied. The students in the room collectively gasped at the seemingly unknown voice echoing through the room. \u201cI should warn you that the entire building has lost power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s taking so long,\u201d Tony cursed. \u201cThor, get your hammer off the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-My hands,\u201d you stuttered, looking down to see that the sun from outside was shining through the clear glass, showcasing tour singed hands that were slightly pink yet felt like it was to the point of burning. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, it\u2019s Y/N!\u201d Peter shouted, looking at your still body while the other students were running and screaming in havoc. </p><p>Tony\u2019s ears perked up and he looked to you standing in the middle of the room, looking down at your hands with a confused expression written all over your face. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Tony said, worried as he rushed to your side. \u201cNatasha, get everyone out of the building! Pete, come with me.\u201d </p><p>Tony brought you to another room where it was quieter. The backup generator seemed to be working because the lights turned on when Tony flipped the switch. He saw your hands turning a shade of red and wasted no time to grab two ice packs and wrap them in paper towels, preparing to bandage them to your palms. </p><p>You, on the other hand, felt like you had lightning coursing through your entire body. It felt like of electricity were pulsing inside of you and bursts of fire were looking at your palms, which the ice packs were help subduing.</p><p>\u201cT-Tony,\u201d you sniffles as he taped your bandage in place. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I need you to grab some sanitizing wipes,\u201d Tony instructed. </p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Peter said without thinking and opened a drawer and handed Tony the wipes. The meticulous man standing in front of you sat you down on one of the medical tables and stood in front of you, cleaning the small amount of blood that had seeped from your palms. </p><p>You shut your eyes at the burning sensation internally and the stinging sensation of the sanitizing wipes Tony used on your hands. But you attention was turned from your pain to how Peter knew where the wipes were.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d you asked, confused. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to be here,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to see a familiar face.\u201d He opted not to tell you about his identity as Spider-Man but had an itch that you were about find out. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;I,\u201d Tony stammered.\u00a0\u201cYou need to see something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Wordlessly, Tony pulled up a device that projected a file docket with the headline\u00a0\u2018Y/N Stark,\u2019 reading the information underneath it. You saw that your blood sample had been tested against Tony\u2019s a few days after you have given a few samples of your blood and it was a positive match when tested against his DNA.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d you whispered to yourself, looking between the projected image and Tony. Peter stood in the background, just as confused as you.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your father, Y/N. I\u2019ve known this for a couple of weeks now,\u201d he explained calmly, not looking you in the eye.\u00a0</p><p>The room was silent. You could hear the heavy breaths of Peter and Tony, and you could feel their eyes staring at you while they awaited your reaction and what you were going to say next.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked yourself in a quiet whisper. The more you stared at the docket, the more you couldn\u2019t believe that the man you had been searching for had been right under your nose the entire time, consoling you about your feelings about your lost father.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he started.\u00a0\u201cPlease say something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d you asked with a snap, looking him in the eye as you spoke before looking back to your bandaged hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019I couldn\u2019t find the strength,\u201d Tony said.\u00a0\u201cYou were standing right in front of me and I didn\u2019t know how to break the news to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you sat there!\u201d you exclaimed with hot tears on the tip of your nose. You could feel yourself needing to take a breather but the last thing on your mind was relaxing.\u00a0\u201cYou sat there and told me I\u2019d find my father when you <i>knew </i>you were him. You lied to me\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I-I didn\u2019t,\u201d Tony replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did, Tony!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gulped and took a deep breath before holding you in between his arms, his hands on either side of your arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for you for seventeen years. I\u2019ve done everything I could to look for your mother and it\u2019s been a dead end search until the day you gave me your DNA sample.\u201d Tony looked at you with desperation.\u00a0\u201cI found you, Y/N. After seventeen years of looking for you I finally found you.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath as Tony pleaded with you to forgive him for not saying anything because after seventeen years, he hadn\u2019t gathered the words or the courage to tell you he was your father. All the times you had visited his tower was a chance for him to come clean and yet he could never physically get himself to speak whenever you were around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d you asked tentatively, your voice cracking and your eyes watering more than they were.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Y/N. It\u2019s always been me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Despite your aching body and hands, you gathered the strength to put your arms around Tony\u2019s shoulder and leaned into him where you put all your weight and trust into the man who you had idolized since you were a young girl. The man who you had wished was your father when you were younger was <i>actually </i>your father and you didn\u2019t have to worry about looking for him anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t imagine what you went through,\u201d you said to Tony after he had pulled away.\u00a0\u201cSeventeen years of your life was spent looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it,\u201d he admitted.\u00a0\u201cIt was worth getting to see the smile on your face when you first walked in here. It was worth telling you today because you don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at his attempt to make a lighthearted joke in a heavy situation, something that your mother had always accused you of doing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy mom,\u201d you said.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s always telling me that my father was a lowlife, sometimes that he was a druggie, or that he was someone who never cared about me but she was wrong.\u201d You let out a cry and Tony rushed to hug you once more.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling perplexed at the woman who had loved him and then left without a note, Tony\u2019s initial feeling in his gut was to tell you to leave your mother and stay with him in the tower where things were safe. You didn\u2019t have to worry about unresolved feelings and you two could get to know each other without interruption.\u00a0</p><p>But all his feelings dissolved when he took one look at your face. His thoughts weren\u2019t in his own interests anymore, but in yours. With a change of heart (a reluctant one), he let his hand move loose strands from your face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTalk to her,\u201d he urged.\u00a0\u201cTell her you know I\u2019m your father. Ask her why she did what she did and maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d you whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d Tony held your hands in his carefully and nodded at you.\u00a0\u201cYou deserve the truth, not another mystery after you\u2019ve solved one already.\u201d</p><p>For the sake of your new relationship with Tony, you agreed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd now for the elephant in the room,\u201d you said bitterly.\u00a0\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>Your head whipped to the boy who was standing in the sidelines and Tony looked between you two, deciding it was better to leave you alone. He stroked your cheek and told you he\u2019d be outside, cleaning up the mess that had ensued until you were ready to go home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d you asked him once Tony had left the room.\u00a0\u201cYou manipulated me, Peter. You made me believe that you hated me while kissing me as Spider-Man. Then you made me feel guilty and confused once you decided to be nice to me as Peter Parker.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you liked me as Spider-Man but ran away from me as Peter Parker. We <i>kissed </i>in my bedroom, Peter! Y-You made me think that we were friends when we aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Y/N, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d you said, shaking your head is disbelief. You stood up from the medical bed and winced at the sudden movement, suddenly feeling the electric jolts in your body again.\u00a0\u201cI just need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, please,\u201d Peter pleaded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you snapped, annoyed at Peter and at your body acting up again.\u00a0\u201cI need time to think and process what I just learned. You\u2019re Spider-Man, for crying out loud!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted to tell you but I didn\u2019t know how, considering you hated Peter Parker,\u201d he retorted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause all you did was ignore me, Peter. From the minute I stepped foot into Midtown until Ned asked me to hang out with you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N&hellip;,\u201d he pleaded. You walked out the door and Peter watched as your figure left. He sighed and watched as Tony ran after you without giving him a spare glance. Peter rubbed his face in his hands, not knowing whether or not you two would ever be on speaking terms again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter asked Tony when he went outside. There, Tony and Thor had been talking feverishly when Peter walked in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d Thor said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe half human, half Asgardian,\u201d Thor explained.\u00a0\u201cAbout seventeen years ago, my father exiled a woman for creating a child that was half human and half Asgardian in fear that the child would one day rise up and try to destroy Asgard. We\u2019ve just found the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Y/N? There\u2019s no way,\u201d Peter begun, not convincing himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Light Bringer,\u201d said Thor.\u00a0\u201cShe kept the peace in the Asgardian council and, to you humans, was the person who brought fire to Earth. That\u2019s why we call her Light Bringer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2019s an Asgardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, yes,\u201d Thor said in all seriousness.\u00a0</p><p>Tony rubbed his chin and sighed heavily, not knowing what to make of the situation that had unfolded in front of him. Thor, having found someone that he had been close to twenty years ago, was over the moon.\u00a0</p><p>All Peter knew was that his spidey senses had finally stopped.</p><p>***</p><p>Your apartment smelled like oregano when you entered.</p><p>It was almost five in the afternoon and your mother was standing in the kitchen, stirring a pot when she turned around and glanced over her shoulder to see you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow was your field trip?\u201d she asked. She stopped stirring when she saw your hands.\u00a0\u201cMy goodness, Y/N. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Tony Stark is my father?\u201d you asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she began.\u00a0\u201cIt was for your own protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me!\u201d you shouted, causing your mother to cease her actions and turn the stove off to prevent the food from burning.\u00a0\u201cOf all the times I\u2019ve asked about my dad, you lied each time I asked.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTo protect you,\u201d your mother reiterated.\u00a0\u201cI lied for your safety.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You were silent.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd for him.\u201d</p><p>Confused, you sighed and sat down, letting your head rest in between your arms before taking the bandages off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI touched Thor\u2019s hammer today,\u201d you began.\u00a0\u201cI touched the hammer and then my hands burned, and the next thing I know, Tony Stark\u2019s telling me he\u2019s my dad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your mother\u2019s head whipped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou touched <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>You shot her an annoyed expression.\u00a0\u201cMjolnir. Thor\u2019s weapon?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your mother sighed.\u00a0\u201cY/N, there\u2019s something I need to tell you. Wait right here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You watched as your mother disappeared around the corner and waited for an explanation as you tapped your leg. She was gone all for a minute before coming back with a long necklace and a pendant attached at the end, sliding it to where you sat before taking a seat at the corner next to you.</p><p>\u201cMy mother gave this to me as a present when I was born,\u201d she began.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a gift that\u2019s been passed down from generation to generation and I was going to give it to you when you were born.\u00a0But as you know, your father was never present in your life and it\u2019s because I left him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d you asked her. Your mother pursed her lips as she heaved a heavy sigh and closed her eyes. She opened them to see you staring at her with a blank expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not from Portland, Y/N. This pendant,\u201d she said, holding up the necklace,\u00a0\u201cis supposed to protect the owner of the necklace. It lets Asgardians find you whenever and wherever you need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Asgardians?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.\u00a0\u201cI came here twenty years ago and met your father, Tony, at one of his charity events. I was sent to Midgard, Earth, by Odin to check in on one of the planets he had been keeping tabs on. I was supposed to be here for six months before returning but I met Tony before I was supposed to leave.</p><p>\u201cI spent a good two years with him, traveling back and forth from Earth to Asgard. I told Tony it was business trips and Odin that I was keeping a close eye on Earth like he had asked me to do. Only, he found out that I was pregnant with you and exiled me from Asgard and swore to eliminate the half human and half Asgardian.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You eyes widened at her confessions and waited for her to speak again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis pendant would\u2019ve activated your powers,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cI got rid of anything from Asagrd because it would\u2019ve activated your powers and sent Odin on a path that would lead him to you.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she began,\u00a0\u201cthe day I found out I was pregnant with you was the happiest day of my life and having to leave Tony was the worst. I didn\u2019t tell you because your life would\u2019ve been in actual danger and now that Valkyrie\u2019s leading Asgard, I don\u2019t think I have to worry about that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you keep this from me if you knew I wasn\u2019t in danger anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know if I still had to look over my shoulder,\u201d your mother said.\u00a0\u201cI spent a long time worrying about our lives and yes, twenty years is a blink of an eye to Asgardians, but not when you\u2019re protecting someone you love.\u201d</p><p>You sat for a moment in silence and she waited for you to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate the lies,\u201d you said.\u00a0\u201cBut, I appreciate you protecting me, mom. I know you do so much for me that I don\u2019t know and I love you so much. I\u2019ll always love you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You stood up and walked to where she was sitting and wrapped your arms around her in a forgiving hug, letting her know that all the secrets she had been harboring wasn\u2019t something you were going to hold against her. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered as you pulled away. She wiped some tears from her cheeks and chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m such a mess, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mom, mom. You say that as if I\u2019m not. Hey, does this mean you\u2019re going to outlive me?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s not think about that right now. By the way, if we\u2019re laying out secrets in the table, there\u2019s something else I think you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d you asked with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing someone for the past few weeks,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWe were just friends for a while but we\u2019re testing the waters right now. I-I really want you to meet her.\u201d </p><p>You watched as your mother tried to suppress a smile but failed when she imagined the thought of two people she loved meeting for the first time.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s mystery woman\u2019s name?\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cAlice,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know when or where yet but I wanted you to know about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should tell you about Peter,\u201d you said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cThe boy who doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t like me but now I think he does? Anyway, you\u2019re Asgardian and since that\u2019s something I don\u2019t think you want people finding out, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll tell anyone what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d She gestured for you to continue. \u201cPeter\u2019s Spider-Man and we kind of have a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been so happy lately?\u201d she asked with a quirked eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you said with a blush. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing. We confessed our feelings to each other but I confessed it to Spider-Man, only to realize it was Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that such a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Peter made me feel like he didn\u2019t like me when he was Peter Parker but made me feel like the luckiest girl on Earth as Spider-Man.\u201d Your mother thought for a moment before speaking. </p><p>\u201cI think this is something you should ask Tony,\u201d she advised. \u201cI can give you all the boy drama advice you want but this is something so specific that only Tony can answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a good idea?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHell if I know. But he probably knows more than I do and it\u2019ll give him a chance to bond with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d you asked. \u201cOr even slightly concerned that I want to get to know Tony?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI still love him, Y/N. I do. Not in the way I did twenty years ago, but I still care for him and he deserves to know the daughter he looked for for over seventeen years. I owe him at least that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you breathed. \u201cBut Peter is like, his protege. Plus, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to trust Peter again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be ready,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to fix itself unless you do something about it. You clearly have feelings for this Peter person, so what better way to clear the air than get advice from someone who knows him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d you said with a grin. \u201cThanks, mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d You began walking out of the kitchen but popped your head back in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean you know Loki and Thor?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>taglist:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM9vm2_2UHQrZ8s3TBOow7g\">@kath94210</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7LLktNYy6UNWt2fhwblFcw\">@sessi03</a> <a

MJ, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t in this class with you and you didn\u2019t enjoy that you would have to leave your best friend alone in school. This was one class you shared with Peter and Ned and didn\u2019t know what to expect, considering your weird encounter with Peter.</p><p>When you walked into class, he nodded in your direction and you gave him a petite wave. Ned gestured for you to sit at the combined table with him and sat in front of the two teenagers as everyone shuffled in.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to Stark Tower,\u201d Ned said out of excitement. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as cool as you think it is,\u201d Peter said casually. \u201cIt\u2019s more businessmen and businesswomen more than Avengers, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d you asked Peter.</p>[[MORE]]<p>His eyes widened. \u201cOh, uh, my internship! Yeah, I intern for Stark Industries and I\u2019ve met the Avengers a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d you said with a gentle smile. \u201cTony seems like a nice person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nicest,\u201d Peter said with a knowing grin.</p><p>You thought about how the field trip would be absolutely redundant considering you had just gotten an extensive tour from Steve Rogers himself, but you were excited to learn more about career paths in an environment you wanted to work in.</p><p>\u201cOkay, class!\u201d Your teacher announced. \u201cRelease forms and liability papers are being passed around. It\u2019s important you get this to me by Thursday the latest if you want to go on this field trip. For the rest of the class period, you can treat this as a study hall.\u201d</p><p>You emitted a sigh and you were internally grateful for this chance to catch up on homework. Due to your late night rendezvous with Spider-Man and your <i>many</i> trips to Stark Tower, you ended up staying up until two in the morning finishing homework for the next school day. </p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll see any Avengers?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d said Peter.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s cool,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to meet an Avenger.\u201d</p><p>You missed this interaction, but Peter gave him a feigned annoyed expression and Ned chuckled at the fact that he had disregarded his best friend being Spider-Man.</p><p>\u201cI hope Spidey\u2019s there,\u201d you said casually as you punched numbers into your calculator. </p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d asked Peter.</p><p>\u201cOh, Spider-Man,\u201d you said, kicking yourself for using your nickname for him. \u201cI hope he\u2019s at the tower. I\u2019d, uh, I\u2019d really like to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really like Spider-Man, huh?\u201d Ned asked politely.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d you said with a sheepish grin. \u201cHe works under the radar and isn\u2019t in it for the fame. He\u2019s just really wholesome and pure, you know? Spider-Man cares for Queens and I couldn\u2019t ask someone better to look up to.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart was racing despite taking the relaxing pill Tony had given him and he knew it was because of the feelings for you he was trying to surpress. His heart, at that moment, wasn\u2019t beating fast because of his spidey senses but rather it was because he has internally admitted to himself that he liked you in a way he never thought possible.</p><p>He liked that you loved computer science and engineering. He liked that you were studious and wanted to get into a good college. He liked that you were mature for your age and had refrained from befriending Flash, despite Peter giving you ever reason to like him more. Most of all, Peter liked that you liked Spider-Man because that meant you liked him. </p><p>The only thing that made him nervous about liking you was not knowing how you\u2019d react to him being Spider-Man. He didn\u2019t know if you liked his alter ego for the fame that came with it or because you got to see a side of him no one else saw. Ned knew he was Spider-Man, sure, but Peter confided in you in a way he couldn\u2019t with Ned. </p><p>Peter was nervous and he was sure that things would work out in the end because if he learned anything from getting to know you, it was that you were understanding and patient. Worst of all, you both admitted to liking one another on your balcony a few nights prior. The tension was building up and Peter was the one who lifted his mask to his nose and press his lips against yours, and you weren\u2019t complaining. </p><p>Peter decided that for now, he wouldn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>When you arrived home, you pulled out the release form and wanted your mother to sign it before you forgot it on your bedroom desk and didn\u2019t want to turn it in too late.</p><p>\u201cHey, mom?\u201d you said as you entered her workspace. She didn\u2019t work from home every often but had a small office space that she used if she ever decided to bring her work home from her main office. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, sweet pea?\u201d she asked with a gentle tone before taking her glasses off and turning to you in the chair she sat in.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrington\u2019s taking us to Stark Tower and needs this permission slip signed by Thursday but I was hoping to get it in tomorrow. Can you sign it for me?\u201d</p><p>Your mother didn\u2019t miss a heartbeat. </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you anywhere near or inside of that tower.\u201d</p><p>You groaned. \u201cWell, why not? You know how much I want to work in the computer science field and this is an opportunity for me to learn more about a future career path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she said, standing up from her seat, \u201cI know this would be good for you but I don\u2019t feel like Stark Tower is the safest place for you to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? There will be so many Avengers in that tower and people who can fight for a living. I\u2019m sixteen and I\u2019m about to start my life really soon and this could be a good way to learn about what I can do for the world.\u201d</p><p>Your mother sighed and gave you a small smile, remembering all the moments you two shared as you grew up. She remembered the first time you touched a computer and decided that, while she didn\u2019t like the idea of going to the tower, there wasn\u2019t stopping you if it was to help your future.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to know I\u2019m advising you against this, but I\u2019ll sign it for you,\u201d she caved.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d you exclaimed as you sat the paper down flat on her desk. You mother heaved a sigh and wrote her signature on a clean line at the bottom before handing the slip back to you.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be extra careful when you\u2019re there,\u201d she said with a worried tone. You furrowed your eyebrows because when your mother got anxious, her tell was tapping her finger on a flat surface and her voice became an octave lower. This was one of those times.</p><p>\u201cI will, mom. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d she said. \u201cOf all the times I\u2019ve taught you life lessons and scolded you to be aware of your surroundings, I really mean it this time. There are some things you don\u2019t know about that could seriously hurt you.\u201d You gave your mother a reassuring hug.</p><p>\u201cI know, mom. There\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know about but I want to learn about them. I\u2019ll be careful, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She gave you a smile and let you to your bedroom to finish your homework, not knowing what she let you get into.</p><p>***</p><p>Before you had arrived to school on the day of the field trip, Peter was rocking back and forth between his legs and trying to stay still when Ned put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDude, are you okay?\u201d he asked. </p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know know why my senses are going off the charts but I can\u2019t seem to slow my heart rate down. The pills Mr. Stark gave me aren\u2019t working and I can\u2019t take another one unless I want to go into cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cWhat about that hunch you had with Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I thought that getting her go open up to me would solve it. She seemed pretty upset about her father and I thought that was the secret she had been keeping but it seems like there\u2019s something else going on with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me,\u201d said Peter. \u201cHere she comes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey Ned,\u201d you said. \u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re chirpy for seven-thirty,\u201d Ned snorted. \u201cI could barely get myself out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty excited, Peter,\u201d you said with a stifled laugh. You had accredited to his antsy-self as excitement but didn\u2019t know he was more nervous than excited.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d said Peter, playing along. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the tower when I\u2019m not working. That\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet! I\u2019m gonna head onto the bus,\u201d you said before walking into the yellow bus.</p><p>\u201cGo sit next to her. See if you can calm yourself down or find something that\u2019ll help you,\u201d Ned told you.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Peter replied. He wasn\u2019t exactly rejecting the idea of being right next to you. He saw you look mildly annoyed at your small shoulder bag when he approached. \u201cIs anyone sitting here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Um, no one\u2019s sitting here,\u201d you said, half paying attention. \u201cDang it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Peter asked as he took a seat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I left my headphones on my desk at home,\u201d you explained while shrugging. \u201cThis next forty-five minutes is gonna go by so slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left mine at home too,\u201d Peter lied, knowing he had left them in the Avenger common room yesterday. \u201cI guess we\u2019re both unlucky today.</p><p>You laughed. \u201cI guess so, Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any fun last weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your friend,\u201d Peter said, clearing his throat. \u201cYou mentioned you were seeing a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cIt was really fun, actually. He took me to this sandwich shop he likes and I are some pretty good food. I\u2019m sorry, you probably not want to hear that,\u201d you said, laughing as you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d Peter said with a genuine smile. \u201cI like it when you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>His statement, bold as ever, shocked you but you were determined to not show how shocked you were to avoid embarrassing yourself.  </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually really sweet of you to say, Peter. Well, we don\u2019t really do much other than hang out,\u201d you said, leaving out the part where he often meets you and Tony Stark in the tower you were headed to. \u201cHe\u2019s real nice. Gentle, even. That\u2019s not weird, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve found someone.\u201d</p><p>You paused. \u201cYou\u2019re being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, three weeks ago you practically ignoring me and now you\u2019re asking about my love life.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed nervously. \u201cNed helped shed some light on how I had been acting. I-I was a shit person to you and I\u2019m really sorry. I was going through some personal things in my life and couldn\u2019t handle another person knowing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>You nodded once and decided that you\u2019d let go of all animosity towards Peter and how you felt about him beforehand. The pent up emotions were let go as soon as you and Spider-Man had admitted feelings for one another and somehow, being around Peter reminded you of the masked hero. With that in mind, you decided that you\u2019d focus your energy and attention on anything but hating Peter Parker.</p><p>The rest of the ride was quite pleasant and you accredited that to letting your wall against Peter crumble down the minute you had felt completely comfortable being around him. It was weird \u2014 you know that there was no reason for you to trust him and yet you sat there feeling like you had known Peter, really know him. His \u2018energy\u2019 was familiar and it wasn\u2019t because you occasionally sat next to him during lunchtime. It wasn\u2019t because you hung out with him once with Ned. This was something else entirely and you weren\u2019t quite sure what it was. </p><p>When you arrived at Stark Tower, Mr. Harrington stood in front of the bus and urged everyone to be on their best behavior. You represented Midtown Tech, he reminded. Any of you could be working there in the future.</p><p>You filed out behind Ned and in front of Peter, who let you walk out the doors first. You looked at the familiar entrance and saw the usual bustling lobby you had grown accustomed to and the usual businessmen and businesswomen running late for meetings.  </p><p>The tour guide met your group by the front doors and \u2018debriefed\u2019 the lot about procedures, rules, and what to do if there\u2019s an emergency that needed to be handled. </p><p>\u201cWelcome to my building,\u201d Tony greeted. His eyes scanned over the crowd and was pleasantly surprised to see both your face and Peter\u2019s. \u201cI hope it\u2019s everything you expected and more.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of applause and happy murmurs were audible as Tony had granted access to a low level access laboratory that showcased what goes on in Stark Industry laboratories. The students milled around and looked at the people in white lab coats work on different projects (that were safe to be around, assured by Tony himself) and inspected daily work in the work space. Tony grinned at you when you caught his eye and saw that Natasha had snuck up to stand beside him. She gave you a wink and you gave her a shy wave before joining the rest of your class for the remaining portion of the tour.</p><p>\u201cThis is so neat,\u201d Ned whisper-yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you see this stuff every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot <i>every</i> day,\u201d Peter retorted. \u201cBut, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>Peter was itching to talk to Tony about the predicament he found himself in. His heart was beating much faster than when he was outside of the building but now it was spiking like there was no tomorrow. </p><p>He walked passed the students while trying to be discreet about needed to see Tony to talk to him about his senses and why they were going haywire more than usual. Yeah, Peter could sense if there was someone running behind him or when Ned was trying to sneak up on him, but this wasn\u2019t something he couldn\u2019t understand. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, kid,\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cCome back after school.\u201d Peter sighed but nodded, knowing he wasn\u2019t going to get anything out of Tony even if he tried. </p><p>The rest of the tour guide consisted of viewing Tony\u2019s private office, meeting other Avengers and visiting superheroes, and talking with different technical experts. It was when Thor showed up at the end of the tour that made the crowd buzz.</p><p>\u201cThor? I thought you were taking care of a project in Texas,\u201d Tony said, confused. </p><p>Thor chuckled. \u201cI got back a few minutes ago when Natasha told me Midtown Tech was visiting.\u201d He nodded his head at Peter, who laughed nervously. </p><p>\u201cHi Thor!\u201d you heard a girl from your group yell out. </p><p>You and Peter simultaneously rolled your eyes and shared a quiet laugh. </p><p>\u201cI was thinking you all could try to lift this old thing,\u201d he said while holding up Mjolnir. \u201cI doubt any of you could lift it but it\u2019ll be funny to see you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds entertaining,\u201d Tony said casually before looking at Mr. Harrington for permission, to which your teacher nodded out of both confusion and in awe. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set it down here,\u201d Thor said, putting Mjolnir in the middle of an unoccupied furnished room. \u201cSo, who wants to try first?\u201d Almost half of the class ran up to be first in line and made a makeshift queue. </p><p>\u201cYou gonna try?\u201d you asked Peter, leaning over to whisper.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll probably give it a go,\u201d he said, knowing he had already tried to pick up Mjolnir up several times. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d you replied. \u201cI know that nothing\u2019s going to happen but I really want to say I lifted the hammer at least once in my lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter! Watch me lift it!\u201d Ned shouted to grab Peter\u2019s attention. Peter laughed and watched as Ned struggled to lift the hammer and heaved a heavy sigh when he was unable to. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d said Ned. He shook his head in feigned disappointment. \u201cPeter, you should try!\u201d</p><p>Peter only laughed, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to pick it up. Thor patted Peter on the back and watched as another student failed to lift the hammer.</p><p>\u201cGood try,\u201d Thor commented. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Ned said in excitement. </p><p>You took a deep breath and felt that your palms were suddenly sweating, but shook the confusion out of your head and blamed your nervousness on the thirty odd pairs of eyes watching you at once. </p><p>But when your hands went to grip the black handles of the sacred hammer, your palms tingled and you felt a burning sensation against your skin and abruptly let go of it with a startled gasp. The room flickered as the room shook slightly before the power turned out, leaving a state of panic within the students in the room.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, turn the lights back on,\u201d said Tony.</p><p>\u201cWorking on turning the backup generator as we speak,\u201d she replied. The students in the room collectively gasped at the seemingly unknown voice echoing through the room. \u201cI should warn you that the entire building has lost power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s taking so long,\u201d Tony cursed. \u201cThor, get your hammer off the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-My hands,\u201d you stuttered, looking down to see that the sun from outside was shining through the clear glass, showcasing tour singed hands that were slightly pink yet felt like it was to the point of burning. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, it\u2019s Y/N!\u201d Peter shouted, looking at your still body while the other students were running and screaming in havoc. </p><p>Tony\u2019s ears perked up and he looked to you standing in the middle of the room, looking down at your hands with a confused expression written all over your face. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Tony said, worried as he rushed to your side. \u201cNatasha, get everyone out of the building! Pete, come with me.\u201d </p><p>Tony brought you to another room where it was quieter. The backup generator seemed to be working because the lights turned on when Tony flipped the switch. He saw your hands turning a shade of red and wasted no time to grab two ice packs and wrap them in paper towels, preparing to bandage them to your palms. </p><p>You, on the other hand, felt like you had lightning coursing through your entire body. It felt like of electricity were pulsing inside of you and bursts of fire were looking at your palms, which the ice packs were help subduing.</p><p>\u201cT-Tony,\u201d you sniffles as he taped your bandage in place. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I need you to grab some sanitizing wipes,\u201d Tony instructed. </p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Peter said without thinking and opened a drawer and handed Tony the wipes. The meticulous man standing in front of you sat you down on one of the medical tables and stood in front of you, cleaning the small amount of blood that had seeped from your palms. </p><p>You shut your eyes at the burning sensation internally and the stinging sensation of the sanitizing wipes Tony used on your hands. But you attention was turned from your pain to how Peter knew where the wipes were.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d you asked, confused. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to be here,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to see a familiar face.\u201d He opted not to tell you about his identity as Spider-Man but had an itch that you were about find out. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I,\u201d Tony stammered.\u00a0\u201cYou need to see something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Wordlessly, Tony pulled up a device that projected a file docket with the headline\u00a0\u2018Y/N Stark,\u2019 reading the information underneath it. You saw that your blood sample had been tested against Tony\u2019s a few days after you have given a few samples of your blood and it was a positive match when tested against his DNA.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d you whispered to yourself, looking between the projected image and Tony. Peter stood in the background, just as confused as you.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your father, Y/N. I\u2019ve known this for a couple of weeks now,\u201d he explained calmly, not looking you in the eye.\u00a0</p><p>The room was silent. You could hear the heavy breaths of Peter and Tony, and you could feel their eyes staring at you while they awaited your reaction and what you were going to say next.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked yourself in a quiet whisper. The more you stared at the docket, the more you couldn\u2019t believe that the man you had been searching for had been right under your nose the entire time, consoling you about your feelings about your lost father.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he started.\u00a0\u201cPlease say something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d you asked with a snap, looking him in the eye as you spoke before looking back to your bandaged hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019I couldn\u2019t find the strength,\u201d Tony said.\u00a0\u201cYou were standing right in front of me and I didn\u2019t know how to break the news to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you sat there!\u201d you exclaimed with hot tears on the tip of your nose. You could feel yourself needing to take a breather but the last thing on your mind was relaxing.\u00a0\u201cYou sat there and told me I\u2019d find my father when you <i>knew </i>you were him. You lied to me\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I-I didn\u2019t,\u201d Tony replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did, Tony!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gulped and took a deep breath before holding you in between his arms, his hands on either side of your arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for you for seventeen years. I\u2019ve done everything I could to look for your mother and it\u2019s been a dead end search until the day you gave me your DNA sample.\u201d Tony looked at you with desperation.\u00a0\u201cI found you, Y/N. After seventeen years of looking for you I finally found you.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath as Tony pleaded with you to forgive him for not saying anything because after seventeen years, he hadn\u2019t gathered the words or the courage to tell you he was your father. All the times you had visited his tower was a chance for him to come clean and yet he could never physically get himself to speak whenever you were around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d you asked tentatively, your voice cracking and your eyes watering more than they were.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Y/N. It\u2019s always been me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Despite your aching body and hands, you gathered the strength to put your arms around Tony\u2019s shoulder and leaned into him where you put all your weight and trust into the man who you had idolized since you were a young girl. The man who you had wished was your father when you were younger was <i>actually </i>your father and you didn\u2019t have to worry about looking for him anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t imagine what you went through,\u201d you said to Tony after he had pulled away.\u00a0\u201cSeventeen years of your life was spent looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it,\u201d he admitted.\u00a0\u201cIt was worth getting to see the smile on your face when you first walked in here. It was worth telling you today because you don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at his attempt to make a lighthearted joke in a heavy situation, something that your mother had always accused you of doing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy mom,\u201d you said.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s always telling me that my father was a lowlife, sometimes that he was a druggie, or that he was someone who never cared about me but she was wrong.\u201d You let out a cry and Tony rushed to hug you once more.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling perplexed at the woman who had loved him and then left without a note, Tony\u2019s initial feeling in his gut was to tell you to leave your mother and stay with him in the tower where things were safe. You didn\u2019t have to worry about unresolved feelings and you two could get to know each other without interruption.\u00a0</p><p>But all his feelings dissolved when he took one look at your face. His thoughts weren\u2019t in his own interests anymore, but in yours. With a change of heart (a reluctant one), he let his hand move loose strands from your face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTalk to her,\u201d he urged.\u00a0\u201cTell her you know I\u2019m your father. Ask her why she did what she did and maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d you whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d Tony held your hands in his carefully and nodded at you.\u00a0\u201cYou deserve the truth, not another mystery after you\u2019ve solved one already.\u201d</p><p>For the sake of your new relationship with Tony, you agreed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd now for the elephant in the room,\u201d you said bitterly.\u00a0\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>Your head whipped to the boy who was standing in the sidelines and Tony looked between you two, deciding it was better to leave you alone. He stroked your cheek and told you he\u2019d be outside, cleaning up the mess that had ensued until you were ready to go home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d you asked him once Tony had left the room.\u00a0\u201cYou manipulated me, Peter. You made me believe that you hated me while kissing me as Spider-Man. Then you made me feel guilty and confused once you decided to be nice to me as Peter Parker.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you liked me as Spider-Man but ran away from me as Peter Parker. We <i>kissed </i>in my bedroom, Peter! Y-You made me think that we were friends when we aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Y/N, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d you said, shaking your head is disbelief. You stood up from the medical bed and winced at the sudden movement, suddenly feeling the electric jolts in your body again.\u00a0\u201cI just need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, please,\u201d Peter pleaded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you snapped, annoyed at Peter and at your body acting up again.\u00a0\u201cI need time to think and process what I just learned. You\u2019re Spider-Man, for crying out loud!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted to tell you but I didn\u2019t know how, considering you hated Peter Parker,\u201d he retorted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause all you did was ignore me, Peter. From the minute I stepped foot into Midtown until Ned asked me to hang out with you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026,\u201d he pleaded. You walked out the door and Peter watched as your figure left. He sighed and watched as Tony ran after you without giving him a spare glance. Peter rubbed his face in his hands, not knowing whether or not you two would ever be on speaking terms again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter asked Tony when he went outside. There, Tony and Thor had been talking feverishly when Peter walked in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d Thor said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe half human, half Asgardian,\u201d Thor explained.\u00a0\u201cAbout seventeen years ago, my father exiled a woman for creating a child that was half human and half Asgardian in fear that the child would one day rise up and try to destroy Asgard. We\u2019ve just found the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Y/N? There\u2019s no way,\u201d Peter begun, not convincing himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Light Bringer,\u201d said Thor.\u00a0\u201cShe kept the peace in the Asgardian council and, to you humans, was the person who brought fire to Earth. That\u2019s why we call her Light Bringer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2019s an Asgardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, yes,\u201d Thor said in all seriousness.\u00a0</p><p>Tony rubbed his chin and sighed heavily, not knowing what to make of the situation that had unfolded in front of him. Thor, having found someone that he had been close to twenty years ago, was over the moon.\u00a0</p><p>All Peter knew was that his spidey senses had finally stopped.</p><p>***</p><p>Your apartment smelled like oregano when you entered.</p><p>It was almost five in the afternoon and your mother was standing in the kitchen, stirring a pot when she turned around and glanced over her shoulder to see you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow was your field trip?\u201d she asked. She stopped stirring when she saw your hands.\u00a0\u201cMy goodness, Y/N. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Tony Stark is my father?\u201d you asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she began.\u00a0\u201cIt was for your own protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me!\u201d you shouted, causing your mother to cease her actions and turn the stove off to prevent the food from burning.\u00a0\u201cOf all the times I\u2019ve asked about my dad, you lied each time I asked.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTo protect you,\u201d your mother reiterated.\u00a0\u201cI lied for your safety.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You were silent.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd for him.\u201d</p><p>Confused, you sighed and sat down, letting your head rest in between your arms before taking the bandages off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI touched Thor\u2019s hammer today,\u201d you began.\u00a0\u201cI touched the hammer and then my hands burned, and the next thing I know, Tony Stark\u2019s telling me he\u2019s my dad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your mother\u2019s head whipped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou touched <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>You shot her an annoyed expression.\u00a0\u201cMjolnir. Thor\u2019s weapon?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your mother sighed.\u00a0\u201cY/N, there\u2019s something I need to tell you. Wait right here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You watched as your mother disappeared around the corner and waited for an explanation as you tapped your leg. She was gone all for a minute before coming back with a long necklace and a pendant attached at the end, sliding it to where you sat before taking a seat at the corner next to you.</p><p>\u201cMy mother gave this to me as a present when I was born,\u201d she began.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a gift that\u2019s been passed down from generation to generation and I was going to give it to you when you were born.\u00a0But as you know, your father was never present in your life and it\u2019s because I left him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d you asked her. Your mother pursed her lips as she heaved a heavy sigh and closed her eyes. She opened them to see you staring at her with a blank expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not from Portland, Y/N. This pendant,\u201d she said, holding up the necklace,\u00a0\u201cis supposed to protect the owner of the necklace. It lets Asgardians find you whenever and wherever you need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Asgardians?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.\u00a0\u201cI came here twenty years ago and met your father, Tony, at one of his charity events. I was sent to Midgard, Earth, by Odin to check in on one of the planets he had been keeping tabs on. I was supposed to be here for six months before returning but I met Tony before I was supposed to leave.</p><p>\u201cI spent a good two years with him, traveling back and forth from Earth to Asgard. I told Tony it was business trips and Odin that I was keeping a close eye on Earth like he had asked me to do. Only, he found out that I was pregnant with you and exiled me from Asgard and swore to eliminate the half human and half Asgardian.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You eyes widened at her confessions and waited for her to speak again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis pendant would\u2019ve activated your powers,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cI got rid of anything from Asagrd because it would\u2019ve activated your powers and sent Odin on a path that would lead him to you.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she began,\u00a0\u201cthe day I found out I was pregnant with you was the happiest day of my life and having to leave Tony was the worst. I didn\u2019t tell you because your life would\u2019ve been in actual danger and now that Valkyrie\u2019s leading Asgard, I don\u2019t think I have to worry about that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you keep this from me if you knew I wasn\u2019t in danger anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know if I still had to look over my shoulder,\u201d your mother said.\u00a0\u201cI spent a long time worrying about our lives and yes, twenty years is a blink of an eye to Asgardians, but not when you\u2019re protecting someone you love.\u201d</p><p>You sat for a moment in silence and she waited for you to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate the lies,\u201d you said.\u00a0\u201cBut, I appreciate you protecting me, mom. I know you do so much for me that I don\u2019t know and I love you so much. I\u2019ll always love you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You stood up and walked to where she was sitting and wrapped your arms around her in a forgiving hug, letting her know that all the secrets she had been harboring wasn\u2019t something you were going to hold against her. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered as you pulled away. She wiped some tears from her cheeks and chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m such a mess, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mom, mom. You say that as if I\u2019m not. Hey, does this mean you\u2019re going to outlive me?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s not think about that right now. By the way, if we\u2019re laying out secrets in the table, there\u2019s something else I think you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d you asked with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing someone for the past few weeks,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWe were just friends for a while but we\u2019re testing the waters right now. I-I really want you to meet her.\u201d </p><p>You watched as your mother tried to suppress a smile but failed when she imagined the thought of two people she loved meeting for the first time.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s mystery woman\u2019s name?\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cAlice,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know when or where yet but I wanted you to know about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should tell you about Peter,\u201d you said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cThe boy who doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t like me but now I think he does? Anyway, you\u2019re Asgardian and since that\u2019s something I don\u2019t think you want people finding out, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll tell anyone what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d She gestured for you to continue. \u201cPeter\u2019s Spider-Man and we kind of have a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been so happy lately?\u201d she asked with a quirked eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you said with a blush. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing. We confessed our feelings to each other but I confessed it to Spider-Man, only to realize it was Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that such a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Peter made me feel like he didn\u2019t like me when he was Peter Parker but made me feel like the luckiest girl on Earth as Spider-Man.\u201d Your mother thought for a moment before speaking. </p><p>\u201cI think this is something you should ask Tony,\u201d she advised. \u201cI can give you all the boy drama advice you want but this is something so specific that only Tony can answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a good idea?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHell if I know. But he probably knows more than I do and it\u2019ll give him a chance to bond with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d you asked. \u201cOr even slightly concerned that I want to get to know Tony?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI still love him, Y/N. I do. Not in the way I did twenty years ago, but I still care for him and he deserves to know the daughter he looked for for over seventeen years. I owe him at least that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you breathed. \u201cBut Peter is like, his protege. Plus, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to trust Peter again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be ready,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to fix itself unless you do something about it. You clearly have feelings for this Peter person, so what better way to clear the air than get advice from someone who knows him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d you said with a grin. \u201cThanks, mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d You began walking out of the kitchen but popped your head back in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean you know Loki and Thor?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>taglist:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM9vm2_2UHQrZ8s3TBOow7g\">@kath94210</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7LLktNYy6UNWt2fhwblFcw\">@sessi03</a> <a

MJ, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t in this class with you and you didn\u2019t enjoy that you would have to leave your best friend alone in school. This was one class you shared with Peter and Ned and didn\u2019t know what to expect, considering your weird encounter with Peter.</p><p>When you walked into class, he nodded in your direction and you gave him a petite wave. Ned gestured for you to sit at the combined table with him and sat in front of the two teenagers as everyone shuffled in.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to Stark Tower,\u201d Ned said out of excitement. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as cool as you think it is,\u201d Peter said casually. \u201cIt\u2019s more businessmen and businesswomen more than Avengers, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d you asked Peter.</p>[[MORE]]<p>His eyes widened. \u201cOh, uh, my internship! Yeah, I intern for Stark Industries and I\u2019ve met the Avengers a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d you said with a gentle smile. \u201cTony seems like a nice person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nicest,\u201d Peter said with a knowing grin.</p><p>You thought about how the field trip would be absolutely redundant considering you had just gotten an extensive tour from Steve Rogers himself, but you were excited to learn more about career paths in an environment you wanted to work in.</p><p>\u201cOkay, class!\u201d Your teacher announced. \u201cRelease forms and liability papers are being passed around. It\u2019s important you get this to me by Thursday the latest if you want to go on this field trip. For the rest of the class period, you can treat this as a study hall.\u201d</p><p>You emitted a sigh and you were internally grateful for this chance to catch up on homework. Due to your late night rendezvous with Spider-Man and your <i>many</i> trips to Stark Tower, you ended up staying up until two in the morning finishing homework for the next school day. </p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll see any Avengers?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d said Peter.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s cool,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to meet an Avenger.\u201d</p><p>You missed this interaction, but Peter gave him a feigned annoyed expression and Ned chuckled at the fact that he had disregarded his best friend being Spider-Man.</p><p>\u201cI hope Spidey\u2019s there,\u201d you said casually as you punched numbers into your calculator. </p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d asked Peter.</p><p>\u201cOh, Spider-Man,\u201d you said, kicking yourself for using your nickname for him. \u201cI hope he\u2019s at the tower. I\u2019d, uh, I\u2019d really like to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really like Spider-Man, huh?\u201d Ned asked politely.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d you said with a sheepish grin. \u201cHe works under the radar and isn\u2019t in it for the fame. He\u2019s just really wholesome and pure, you know? Spider-Man cares for Queens and I couldn\u2019t ask someone better to look up to.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart was racing despite taking the relaxing pill Tony had given him and he knew it was because of the feelings for you he was trying to surpress. His heart, at that moment, wasn\u2019t beating fast because of his spidey senses but rather it was because he has internally admitted to himself that he liked you in a way he never thought possible.</p><p>He liked that you loved computer science and engineering. He liked that you were studious and wanted to get into a good college. He liked that you were mature for your age and had refrained from befriending Flash, despite Peter giving you ever reason to like him more. Most of all, Peter liked that you liked Spider-Man because that meant you liked him. </p><p>The only thing that made him nervous about liking you was not knowing how you\u2019d react to him being Spider-Man. He didn\u2019t know if you liked his alter ego for the fame that came with it or because you got to see a side of him no one else saw. Ned knew he was Spider-Man, sure, but Peter confided in you in a way he couldn\u2019t with Ned. </p><p>Peter was nervous and he was sure that things would work out in the end because if he learned anything from getting to know you, it was that you were understanding and patient. Worst of all, you both admitted to liking one another on your balcony a few nights prior. The tension was building up and Peter was the one who lifted his mask to his nose and press his lips against yours, and you weren\u2019t complaining. </p><p>Peter decided that for now, he wouldn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>When you arrived home, you pulled out the release form and wanted your mother to sign it before you forgot it on your bedroom desk and didn\u2019t want to turn it in too late.</p><p>\u201cHey, mom?\u201d you said as you entered her workspace. She didn\u2019t work from home every often but had a small office space that she used if she ever decided to bring her work home from her main office. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, sweet pea?\u201d she asked with a gentle tone before taking her glasses off and turning to you in the chair she sat in.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrington\u2019s taking us to Stark Tower and needs this permission slip signed by Thursday but I was hoping to get it in tomorrow. Can you sign it for me?\u201d</p><p>Your mother didn\u2019t miss a heartbeat. </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you anywhere near or inside of that tower.\u201d</p><p>You groaned. \u201cWell, why not? You know how much I want to work in the computer science field and this is an opportunity for me to learn more about a future career path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she said, standing up from her seat, \u201cI know this would be good for you but I don\u2019t feel like Stark Tower is the safest place for you to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? There will be so many Avengers in that tower and people who can fight for a living. I\u2019m sixteen and I\u2019m about to start my life really soon and this could be a good way to learn about what I can do for the world.\u201d</p><p>Your mother sighed and gave you a small smile, remembering all the moments you two shared as you grew up. She remembered the first time you touched a computer and decided that, while she didn\u2019t like the idea of going to the tower, there wasn\u2019t stopping you if it was to help your future.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to know I\u2019m advising you against this, but I\u2019ll sign it for you,\u201d she caved.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d you exclaimed as you sat the paper down flat on her desk. You mother heaved a sigh and wrote her signature on a clean line at the bottom before handing the slip back to you.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be extra careful when you\u2019re there,\u201d she said with a worried tone. You furrowed your eyebrows because when your mother got anxious, her tell was tapping her finger on a flat surface and her voice became an octave lower. This was one of those times.</p><p>\u201cI will, mom. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d she said. \u201cOf all the times I\u2019ve taught you life lessons and scolded you to be aware of your surroundings, I really mean it this time. There are some things you don\u2019t know about that could seriously hurt you.\u201d You gave your mother a reassuring hug.</p><p>\u201cI know, mom. There\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know about but I want to learn about them. I\u2019ll be careful, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She gave you a smile and let you to your bedroom to finish your homework, not knowing what she let you get into.</p><p>***</p><p>Before you had arrived to school on the day of the field trip, Peter was rocking back and forth between his legs and trying to stay still when Ned put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDude, are you okay?\u201d he asked. </p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know know why my senses are going off the charts but I can\u2019t seem to slow my heart rate down. The pills Mr. Stark gave me aren\u2019t working and I can\u2019t take another one unless I want to go into cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Ned replied. \u201cWhat about that hunch you had with Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I thought that getting her go open up to me would solve it. She seemed pretty upset about her father and I thought that was the secret she had been keeping but it seems like there\u2019s something else going on with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me,\u201d said Peter. \u201cHere she comes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey Ned,\u201d you said. \u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re chirpy for seven-thirty,\u201d Ned snorted. \u201cI could barely get myself out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty excited, Peter,\u201d you said with a stifled laugh. You had accredited to his antsy-self as excitement but didn\u2019t know he was more nervous than excited.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d said Peter, playing along. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the tower when I\u2019m not working. That\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet! I\u2019m gonna head onto the bus,\u201d you said before walking into the yellow bus.</p><p>\u201cGo sit next to her. See if you can calm yourself down or find something that\u2019ll help you,\u201d Ned told you.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Peter replied. He wasn\u2019t exactly rejecting the idea of being right next to you. He saw you look mildly annoyed at your small shoulder bag when he approached. \u201cIs anyone sitting here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Um, no one\u2019s sitting here,\u201d you said, half paying attention. \u201cDang it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Peter asked as he took a seat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I left my headphones on my desk at home,\u201d you explained while shrugging. \u201cThis next forty-five minutes is gonna go by so slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left mine at home too,\u201d Peter lied, knowing he had left them in the Avenger common room yesterday. \u201cI guess we\u2019re both unlucky today.</p><p>You laughed. \u201cI guess so, Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any fun last weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your friend,\u201d Peter said, clearing his throat. \u201cYou mentioned you were seeing a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cIt was really fun, actually. He took me to this sandwich shop he likes and I are some pretty good food. I\u2019m sorry, you probably not want to hear that,\u201d you said, laughing as you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d Peter said with a genuine smile. \u201cI like it when you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>His statement, bold as ever, shocked you but you were determined to not show how shocked you were to avoid embarrassing yourself.  </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually really sweet of you to say, Peter. Well, we don\u2019t really do much other than hang out,\u201d you said, leaving out the part where he often meets you and Tony Stark in the tower you were headed to. \u201cHe\u2019s real nice. Gentle, even. That\u2019s not weird, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve found someone.\u201d</p><p>You paused. \u201cYou\u2019re being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, three weeks ago you practically ignoring me and now you\u2019re asking about my love life.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed nervously. \u201cNed helped shed some light on how I had been acting. I-I was a shit person to you and I\u2019m really sorry. I was going through some personal things in my life and couldn\u2019t handle another person knowing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>You nodded once and decided that you\u2019d let go of all animosity towards Peter and how you felt about him beforehand. The pent up emotions were let go as soon as you and Spider-Man had admitted feelings for one another and somehow, being around Peter reminded you of the masked hero. With that in mind, you decided that you\u2019d focus your energy and attention on anything but hating Peter Parker.</p><p>The rest of the ride was quite pleasant and you accredited that to letting your wall against Peter crumble down the minute you had felt completely comfortable being around him. It was weird \u2014 you know that there was no reason for you to trust him and yet you sat there feeling like you had known Peter, really know him. His \u2018energy\u2019 was familiar and it wasn\u2019t because you occasionally sat next to him during lunchtime. It wasn\u2019t because you hung out with him once with Ned. This was something else entirely and you weren\u2019t quite sure what it was. </p><p>When you arrived at Stark Tower, Mr. Harrington stood in front of the bus and urged everyone to be on their best behavior. You represented Midtown Tech, he reminded. Any of you could be working there in the future.</p><p>You filed out behind Ned and in front of Peter, who let you walk out the doors first. You looked at the familiar entrance and saw the usual bustling lobby you had grown accustomed to and the usual businessmen and businesswomen running late for meetings.  </p><p>The tour guide met your group by the front doors and \u2018debriefed\u2019 the lot about procedures, rules, and what to do if there\u2019s an emergency that needed to be handled. </p><p>\u201cWelcome to my building,\u201d Tony greeted. His eyes scanned over the crowd and was pleasantly surprised to see both your face and Peter\u2019s. \u201cI hope it\u2019s everything you expected and more.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of applause and happy murmurs were audible as Tony had granted access to a low level access laboratory that showcased what goes on in Stark Industry laboratories. The students milled around and looked at the people in white lab coats work on different projects (that were safe to be around, assured by Tony himself) and inspected daily work in the work space. Tony grinned at you when you caught his eye and saw that Natasha had snuck up to stand beside him. She gave you a wink and you gave her a shy wave before joining the rest of your class for the remaining portion of the tour.</p><p>\u201cThis is so neat,\u201d Ned whisper-yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you see this stuff every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot <i>every</i> day,\u201d Peter retorted. \u201cBut, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>Peter was itching to talk to Tony about the predicament he found himself in. His heart was beating much faster than when he was outside of the building but now it was spiking like there was no tomorrow. </p><p>He walked passed the students while trying to be discreet about needed to see Tony to talk to him about his senses and why they were going haywire more than usual. Yeah, Peter could sense if there was someone running behind him or when Ned was trying to sneak up on him, but this wasn\u2019t something he couldn\u2019t understand. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, kid,\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cCome back after school.\u201d Peter sighed but nodded, knowing he wasn\u2019t going to get anything out of Tony even if he tried. </p><p>The rest of the tour guide consisted of viewing Tony\u2019s private office, meeting other Avengers and visiting superheroes, and talking with different technical experts. It was when Thor showed up at the end of the tour that made the crowd buzz.</p><p>\u201cThor? I thought you were taking care of a project in Texas,\u201d Tony said, confused. </p><p>Thor chuckled. \u201cI got back a few minutes ago when Natasha told me Midtown Tech was visiting.\u201d He nodded his head at Peter, who laughed nervously. </p><p>\u201cHi Thor!\u201d you heard a girl from your group yell out. </p><p>You and Peter simultaneously rolled your eyes and shared a quiet laugh. </p><p>\u201cI was thinking you all could try to lift this old thing,\u201d he said while holding up Mjolnir. \u201cI doubt any of you could lift it but it\u2019ll be funny to see you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds entertaining,\u201d Tony said casually before looking at Mr. Harrington for permission, to which your teacher nodded out of both confusion and in awe. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set it down here,\u201d Thor said, putting Mjolnir in the middle of an unoccupied furnished room. \u201cSo, who wants to try first?\u201d Almost half of the class ran up to be first in line and made a makeshift queue. </p><p>\u201cYou gonna try?\u201d you asked Peter, leaning over to whisper.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll probably give it a go,\u201d he said, knowing he had already tried to pick up Mjolnir up several times. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d you replied. \u201cI know that nothing\u2019s going to happen but I really want to say I lifted the hammer at least once in my lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter! Watch me lift it!\u201d Ned shouted to grab Peter\u2019s attention. Peter laughed and watched as Ned struggled to lift the hammer and heaved a heavy sigh when he was unable to. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d said Ned. He shook his head in feigned disappointment. \u201cPeter, you should try!\u201d</p><p>Peter only laughed, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to pick it up. Thor patted Peter on the back and watched as another student failed to lift the hammer.</p><p>\u201cGood try,\u201d Thor commented. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Ned said in excitement. </p><p>You took a deep breath and felt that your palms were suddenly sweating, but shook the confusion out of your head and blamed your nervousness on the thirty odd pairs of eyes watching you at once. </p><p>But when your hands went to grip the black handles of the sacred hammer, your palms tingled and you felt a burning sensation against your skin and abruptly let go of it with a startled gasp. The room flickered as the room shook slightly before the power turned out, leaving a state of panic within the students in the room.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, turn the lights back on,\u201d said Tony.</p><p>\u201cWorking on turning the backup generator as we speak,\u201d she replied. The students in the room collectively gasped at the seemingly unknown voice echoing through the room. \u201cI should warn you that the entire building has lost power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s taking so long,\u201d Tony cursed. \u201cThor, get your hammer off the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-My hands,\u201d you stuttered, looking down to see that the sun from outside was shining through the clear glass, showcasing tour singed hands that were slightly pink yet felt like it was to the point of burning. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, it\u2019s Y/N!\u201d Peter shouted, looking at your still body while the other students were running and screaming in havoc. </p><p>Tony\u2019s ears perked up and he looked to you standing in the middle of the room, looking down at your hands with a confused expression written all over your face. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Tony said, worried as he rushed to your side. \u201cNatasha, get everyone out of the building! Pete, come with me.\u201d </p><p>Tony brought you to another room where it was quieter. The backup generator seemed to be working because the lights turned on when Tony flipped the switch. He saw your hands turning a shade of red and wasted no time to grab two ice packs and wrap them in paper towels, preparing to bandage them to your palms. </p><p>You, on the other hand, felt like you had lightning coursing through your entire body. It felt like of electricity were pulsing inside of you and bursts of fire were looking at your palms, which the ice packs were help subduing.</p><p>\u201cT-Tony,\u201d you sniffles as he taped your bandage in place. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I need you to grab some sanitizing wipes,\u201d Tony instructed. </p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Peter said without thinking and opened a drawer and handed Tony the wipes. The meticulous man standing in front of you sat you down on one of the medical tables and stood in front of you, cleaning the small amount of blood that had seeped from your palms. </p><p>You shut your eyes at the burning sensation internally and the stinging sensation of the sanitizing wipes Tony used on your hands. But you attention was turned from your pain to how Peter knew where the wipes were.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d you asked, confused. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to be here,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to see a familiar face.\u201d He opted not to tell you about his identity as Spider-Man but had an itch that you were about find out. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I,\u201d Tony stammered.\u00a0\u201cYou need to see something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Wordlessly, Tony pulled up a device that projected a file docket with the headline\u00a0\u2018Y/N Stark,\u2019 reading the information underneath it. You saw that your blood sample had been tested against Tony\u2019s a few days after you have given a few samples of your blood and it was a positive match when tested against his DNA.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d you whispered to yourself, looking between the projected image and Tony. Peter stood in the background, just as confused as you.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your father, Y/N. I\u2019ve known this for a couple of weeks now,\u201d he explained calmly, not looking you in the eye.\u00a0</p><p>The room was silent. You could hear the heavy breaths of Peter and Tony, and you could feel their eyes staring at you while they awaited your reaction and what you were going to say next.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked yourself in a quiet whisper. The more you stared at the docket, the more you couldn\u2019t believe that the man you had been searching for had been right under your nose the entire time, consoling you about your feelings about your lost father.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he started.\u00a0\u201cPlease say something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d you asked with a snap, looking him in the eye as you spoke before looking back to your bandaged hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019I couldn\u2019t find the strength,\u201d Tony said.\u00a0\u201cYou were standing right in front of me and I didn\u2019t know how to break the news to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you sat there!\u201d you exclaimed with hot tears on the tip of your nose. You could feel yourself needing to take a breather but the last thing on your mind was relaxing.\u00a0\u201cYou sat there and told me I\u2019d find my father when you <i>knew </i>you were him. You lied to me\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I-I didn\u2019t,\u201d Tony replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did, Tony!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gulped and took a deep breath before holding you in between his arms, his hands on either side of your arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for you for seventeen years. I\u2019ve done everything I could to look for your mother and it\u2019s been a dead end search until the day you gave me your DNA sample.\u201d Tony looked at you with desperation.\u00a0\u201cI found you, Y/N. After seventeen years of looking for you I finally found you.\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath as Tony pleaded with you to forgive him for not saying anything because after seventeen years, he hadn\u2019t gathered the words or the courage to tell you he was your father. All the times you had visited his tower was a chance for him to come clean and yet he could never physically get himself to speak whenever you were around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d you asked tentatively, your voice cracking and your eyes watering more than they were.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Y/N. It\u2019s always been me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Despite your aching body and hands, you gathered the strength to put your arms around Tony\u2019s shoulder and leaned into him where you put all your weight and trust into the man who you had idolized since you were a young girl. The man who you had wished was your father when you were younger was <i>actually </i>your father and you didn\u2019t have to worry about looking for him anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t imagine what you went through,\u201d you said to Tony after he had pulled away.\u00a0\u201cSeventeen years of your life was spent looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it,\u201d he admitted.\u00a0\u201cIt was worth getting to see the smile on your face when you first walked in here. It was worth telling you today because you don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at his attempt to make a lighthearted joke in a heavy situation, something that your mother had always accused you of doing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy mom,\u201d you said.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s always telling me that my father was a lowlife, sometimes that he was a druggie, or that he was someone who never cared about me but she was wrong.\u201d You let out a cry and Tony rushed to hug you once more.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling perplexed at the woman who had loved him and then left without a note, Tony\u2019s initial feeling in his gut was to tell you to leave your mother and stay with him in the tower where things were safe. You didn\u2019t have to worry about unresolved feelings and you two could get to know each other without interruption.\u00a0</p><p>But all his feelings dissolved when he took one look at your face. His thoughts weren\u2019t in his own interests anymore, but in yours. With a change of heart (a reluctant one), he let his hand move loose strands from your face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTalk to her,\u201d he urged.\u00a0\u201cTell her you know I\u2019m your father. Ask her why she did what she did and maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d you whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d Tony held your hands in his carefully and nodded at you.\u00a0\u201cYou deserve the truth, not another mystery after you\u2019ve solved one already.\u201d</p><p>For the sake of your new relationship with Tony, you agreed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd now for the elephant in the room,\u201d you said bitterly.\u00a0\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>Your head whipped to the boy who was standing in the sidelines and Tony looked between you two, deciding it was better to leave you alone. He stroked your cheek and told you he\u2019d be outside, cleaning up the mess that had ensued until you were ready to go home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d you asked him once Tony had left the room.\u00a0\u201cYou manipulated me, Peter. You made me believe that you hated me while kissing me as Spider-Man. Then you made me feel guilty and confused once you decided to be nice to me as Peter Parker.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you liked me as Spider-Man but ran away from me as Peter Parker. We <i>kissed </i>in my bedroom, Peter! Y-You made me think that we were friends when we aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Y/N, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d you said, shaking your head is disbelief. You stood up from the medical bed and winced at the sudden movement, suddenly feeling the electric jolts in your body again.\u00a0\u201cI just need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, please,\u201d Peter pleaded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you snapped, annoyed at Peter and at your body acting up again.\u00a0\u201cI need time to think and process what I just learned. You\u2019re Spider-Man, for crying out loud!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted to tell you but I didn\u2019t know how, considering you hated Peter Parker,\u201d he retorted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause all you did was ignore me, Peter. From the minute I stepped foot into Midtown until Ned asked me to hang out with you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026,\u201d he pleaded. You walked out the door and Peter watched as your figure left. He sighed and watched as Tony ran after you without giving him a spare glance. Peter rubbed his face in his hands, not knowing whether or not you two would ever be on speaking terms again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter asked Tony when he went outside. There, Tony and Thor had been talking feverishly when Peter walked in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d Thor said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe half human, half Asgardian,\u201d Thor explained.\u00a0\u201cAbout seventeen years ago, my father exiled a woman for creating a child that was half human and half Asgardian in fear that the child would one day rise up and try to destroy Asgard. We\u2019ve just found the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Y/N? There\u2019s no way,\u201d Peter begun, not convincing himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Light Bringer,\u201d said Thor.\u00a0\u201cShe kept the peace in the Asgardian council and, to you humans, was the person who brought fire to Earth. That\u2019s why we call her Light Bringer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2019s an Asgardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, yes,\u201d Thor said in all seriousness.\u00a0</p><p>Tony rubbed his chin and sighed heavily, not knowing what to make of the situation that had unfolded in front of him. Thor, having found someone that he had been close to twenty years ago, was over the moon.\u00a0</p><p>All Peter knew was that his spidey senses had finally stopped.</p><p>***</p><p>Your apartment smelled like oregano when you entered.</p><p>It was almost five in the afternoon and your mother was standing in the kitchen, stirring a pot when she turned around and glanced over her shoulder to see you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow was your field trip?\u201d she asked. She stopped stirring when she saw your hands.\u00a0\u201cMy goodness, Y/N. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Tony Stark is my father?\u201d you asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she began.\u00a0\u201cIt was for your own protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me!\u201d you shouted, causing your mother to cease her actions and turn the stove off to prevent the food from burning.\u00a0\u201cOf all the times I\u2019ve asked about my dad, you lied each time I asked.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTo protect you,\u201d your mother reiterated.\u00a0\u201cI lied for your safety.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You were silent.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd for him.\u201d</p><p>Confused, you sighed and sat down, letting your head rest in between your arms before taking the bandages off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI touched Thor\u2019s hammer today,\u201d you began.\u00a0\u201cI touched the hammer and then my hands burned, and the next thing I know, Tony Stark\u2019s telling me he\u2019s my dad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your mother\u2019s head whipped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou touched <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>You shot her an annoyed expression.\u00a0\u201cMjolnir. Thor\u2019s weapon?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your mother sighed.\u00a0\u201cY/N, there\u2019s something I need to tell you. Wait right here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You watched as your mother disappeared around the corner and waited for an explanation as you tapped your leg. She was gone all for a minute before coming back with a long necklace and a pendant attached at the end, sliding it to where you sat before taking a seat at the corner next to you.</p><p>\u201cMy mother gave this to me as a present when I was born,\u201d she began.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a gift that\u2019s been passed down from generation to generation and I was going to give it to you when you were born.\u00a0But as you know, your father was never present in your life and it\u2019s because I left him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d you asked her. Your mother pursed her lips as she heaved a heavy sigh and closed her eyes. She opened them to see you staring at her with a blank expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not from Portland, Y/N. This pendant,\u201d she said, holding up the necklace,\u00a0\u201cis supposed to protect the owner of the necklace. It lets Asgardians find you whenever and wherever you need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Asgardians?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.\u00a0\u201cI came here twenty years ago and met your father, Tony, at one of his charity events. I was sent to Midgard, Earth, by Odin to check in on one of the planets he had been keeping tabs on. I was supposed to be here for six months before returning but I met Tony before I was supposed to leave.</p><p>\u201cI spent a good two years with him, traveling back and forth from Earth to Asgard. I told Tony it was business trips and Odin that I was keeping a close eye on Earth like he had asked me to do. Only, he found out that I was pregnant with you and exiled me from Asgard and swore to eliminate the half human and half Asgardian.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You eyes widened at her confessions and waited for her to speak again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis pendant would\u2019ve activated your powers,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cI got rid of anything from Asagrd because it would\u2019ve activated your powers and sent Odin on a path that would lead him to you.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she began,\u00a0\u201cthe day I found out I was pregnant with you was the happiest day of my life and having to leave Tony was the worst. I didn\u2019t tell you because your life would\u2019ve been in actual danger and now that Valkyrie\u2019s leading Asgard, I don\u2019t think I have to worry about that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you keep this from me if you knew I wasn\u2019t in danger anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know if I still had to look over my shoulder,\u201d your mother said.\u00a0\u201cI spent a long time worrying about our lives and yes, twenty years is a blink of an eye to Asgardians, but not when you\u2019re protecting someone you love.\u201d</p><p>You sat for a moment in silence and she waited for you to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate the lies,\u201d you said.\u00a0\u201cBut, I appreciate you protecting me, mom. I know you do so much for me that I don\u2019t know and I love you so much. I\u2019ll always love you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You stood up and walked to where she was sitting and wrapped your arms around her in a forgiving hug, letting her know that all the secrets she had been harboring wasn\u2019t something you were going to hold against her. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered as you pulled away. She wiped some tears from her cheeks and chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m such a mess, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mom, mom. You say that as if I\u2019m not. Hey, does this mean you\u2019re going to outlive me?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s not think about that right now. By the way, if we\u2019re laying out secrets in the table, there\u2019s something else I think you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d you asked with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing someone for the past few weeks,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWe were just friends for a while but we\u2019re testing the waters right now. I-I really want you to meet her.\u201d </p><p>You watched as your mother tried to suppress a smile but failed when she imagined the thought of two people she loved meeting for the first time.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s mystery woman\u2019s name?\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cAlice,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know when or where yet but I wanted you to know about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should tell you about Peter,\u201d you said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cThe boy who doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t like me but now I think he does? Anyway, you\u2019re Asgardian and since that\u2019s something I don\u2019t think you want people finding out, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll tell anyone what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d She gestured for you to continue. \u201cPeter\u2019s Spider-Man and we kind of have a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been so happy lately?\u201d she asked with a quirked eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you said with a blush. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing. We confessed our feelings to each other but I confessed it to Spider-Man, only to realize it was Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that such a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Peter made me feel like he didn\u2019t like me when he was Peter Parker but made me feel like the luckiest girl on Earth as Spider-Man.\u201d Your mother thought for a moment before speaking. </p><p>\u201cI think this is something you should ask Tony,\u201d she advised. \u201cI can give you all the boy drama advice you want but this is something so specific that only Tony can answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a good idea?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHell if I know. But he probably knows more than I do and it\u2019ll give him a chance to bond with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d you asked. \u201cOr even slightly concerned that I want to get to know Tony?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI still love him, Y/N. I do. Not in the way I did twenty years ago, but I still care for him and he deserves to know the daughter he looked for for over seventeen years. I owe him at least that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you breathed. \u201cBut Peter is like, his protege. Plus, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to trust Peter again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be ready,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to fix itself unless you do something about it. You clearly have feelings for this Peter person, so what better way to clear the air than get advice from someone who knows him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d you said with a grin. \u201cThanks, mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d You began walking out of the kitchen but popped your head back in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean

MJ, unfortunately, wasn&rsquo;t in this class with you and you didn&rsquo;t enjoy that you would have to leave your best friend alone in school. This was one class you shared with Peter and Ned and didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, considering your weird encounter with Peter.</p><p>When you walked into class, he nodded in your direction and you gave him a petite wave. Ned gestured for you to sit at the combined table with him and sat in front of the two teenagers as everyone shuffled in.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going to Stark Tower,&rdquo; Ned said out of excitement. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as cool as you think it is,&rdquo; Peter said casually. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more businessmen and businesswomen more than Avengers, honestly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; you asked Peter.</p><p>His eyes widened. &ldquo;Oh, uh, my internship! Yeah, I intern for Stark Industries and I&rsquo;ve met the Avengers a couple of times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty cool,&rdquo; you said with a gentle smile. &ldquo;Tony seems like a nice person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The nicest,&rdquo; Peter said with a knowing grin.</p><p>You thought about how the field trip would be absolutely redundant considering you had just gotten an extensive tour from Steve Rogers himself, but you were excited to learn more about career paths in an environment you wanted to work in.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, class!&rdquo; Your teacher announced. &ldquo;Release forms and liability papers are being passed around. It&rsquo;s important you get this to me by Thursday the latest if you want to go on this field trip. For the rest of the class period, you can treat this as a study hall.&rdquo;</p><p>You emitted a sigh and you were internally grateful for this chance to catch up on homework. Due to your late night rendezvous with Spider-Man and your <i>many</i> trips to Stark Tower, you ended up staying up until two in the morning finishing homework for the next school day. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll see any Avengers?&rdquo; Ned asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; said Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m going to meet an Avenger.&rdquo;</p><p>You missed this interaction, but Peter gave him a feigned annoyed expression and Ned chuckled at the fact that he had disregarded his best friend being Spider-Man.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope Spidey&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; you said casually as you punched numbers into your calculator. </p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Spider-Man,&rdquo; you said, kicking yourself for using your nickname for him. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s at the tower. I&rsquo;d, uh, I&rsquo;d really like to meet him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really like Spider-Man, huh?&rdquo; Ned asked politely.</p><p>&ldquo;You could say that,&rdquo; you said with a sheepish grin. &ldquo;He works under the radar and isn&rsquo;t in it for the fame. He&rsquo;s just really wholesome and pure, you know? Spider-Man cares for Queens and I couldn&rsquo;t ask someone better to look up to.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s heart was racing despite taking the relaxing pill Tony had given him and he knew it was because of the feelings for you he was trying to surpress. His heart, at that moment, wasn&rsquo;t beating fast because of his spidey senses but rather it was because he has internally admitted to himself that he liked you in a way he never thought possible.</p><p>He liked that you loved computer science and engineering. He liked that you were studious and wanted to get into a good college. He liked that you were mature for your age and had refrained from befriending Flash, despite Peter giving you ever reason to like him more. Most of all, Peter liked that you liked Spider-Man because that meant you liked him. </p><p>The only thing that made him nervous about liking you was not knowing how you&rsquo;d react to him being Spider-Man. He didn&rsquo;t know if you liked his alter ego for the fame that came with it or because you got to see a side of him no one else saw. Ned knew he was Spider-Man, sure, but Peter confided in you in a way he couldn&rsquo;t with Ned. </p><p>Peter was nervous and he was sure that things would work out in the end because if he learned anything from getting to know you, it was that you were understanding and patient. Worst of all, you both admitted to liking one another on your balcony a few nights prior. The tension was building up and Peter was the one who lifted his mask to his nose and press his lips against yours, and you weren&rsquo;t complaining. </p><p>Peter decided that for now, he wouldn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>When you arrived home, you pulled out the release form and wanted your mother to sign it before you forgot it on your bedroom desk and didn&rsquo;t want to turn it in too late.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, mom?&rdquo; you said as you entered her workspace. She didn&rsquo;t work from home every often but had a small office space that she used if she ever decided to bring her work home from her main office. </p><p>&ldquo;What is it, sweet pea?&rdquo; she asked with a gentle tone before taking her glasses off and turning to you in the chair she sat in.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Harrington&rsquo;s taking us to Stark Tower and needs this permission slip signed by Thursday but I was hoping to get it in tomorrow. Can you sign it for me?&rdquo;</p><p>Your mother didn&rsquo;t miss a heartbeat. </p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you anywhere near or inside of that tower.&rdquo;</p><p>You groaned. &ldquo;Well, why not? You know how much I want to work in the computer science field and this is an opportunity for me to learn more about a future career path.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; she said, standing up from her seat, &ldquo;I know this would be good for you but I don&rsquo;t feel like Stark Tower is the safest place for you to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? There will be so many Avengers in that tower and people who can fight for a living. I&rsquo;m sixteen and I&rsquo;m about to start my life really soon and this could be a good way to learn about what I can do for the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Your mother sighed and gave you a small smile, remembering all the moments you two shared as you grew up. She remembered the first time you touched a computer and decided that, while she didn&rsquo;t like the idea of going to the tower, there wasn&rsquo;t stopping you if it was to help your future.</p><p>&ldquo;I just want you to know I&rsquo;m advising you against this, but I&rsquo;ll sign it for you,&rdquo; she caved.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes!&rdquo; you exclaimed as you sat the paper down flat on her desk. You mother heaved a sigh and wrote her signature on a clean line at the bottom before handing the slip back to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to be extra careful when you&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; she said with a worried tone. You furrowed your eyebrows because when your mother got anxious, her tell was tapping her finger on a flat surface and her voice became an octave lower. This was one of those times.</p><p>&ldquo;I will, mom. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of all the times I&rsquo;ve taught you life lessons and scolded you to be aware of your surroundings, I really mean it this time. There are some things you don&rsquo;t know about that could seriously hurt you.&rdquo; You gave your mother a reassuring hug.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, mom. There&rsquo;s so much I don&rsquo;t know about but I want to learn about them. I&rsquo;ll be careful, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave you a smile and let you to your bedroom to finish your homework, not knowing what she let you get into.</p><p>***</p><p>Before you had arrived to school on the day of the field trip, Peter was rocking back and forth between his legs and trying to stay still when Ned put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, are you okay?&rdquo; he asked. </p><p>Peter shook his head. &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t know know why my senses are going off the charts but I can&rsquo;t seem to slow my heart rate down. The pills Mr. Stark gave me aren&rsquo;t working and I can&rsquo;t take another one unless I want to go into cardiac arrest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, man,&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;What about that hunch you had with Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See, I thought that getting her go open up to me would solve it. She seemed pretty upset about her father and I thought that was the secret she had been keeping but it seems like there&rsquo;s something else going on with her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beats me,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Here she comes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Ned,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re chirpy for seven-thirty,&rdquo; Ned snorted. &ldquo;I could barely get myself out of bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You look pretty excited, Peter,&rdquo; you said with a stifled laugh. You had accredited to his antsy-self as excitement but didn&rsquo;t know he was more nervous than excited.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; said Peter, playing along. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see the tower when I&rsquo;m not working. That&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bet! I&rsquo;m gonna head onto the bus,&rdquo; you said before walking into the yellow bus.</p><p>&ldquo;Go sit next to her. See if you can calm yourself down or find something that&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; Ned told you.</p><p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Peter replied. He wasn&rsquo;t exactly rejecting the idea of being right next to you. He saw you look mildly annoyed at your small shoulder bag when he approached. &ldquo;Is anyone sitting here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Um, no one&rsquo;s sitting here,&rdquo; you said, half paying attention. &ldquo;Dang it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Peter asked as he took a seat. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think I left my headphones on my desk at home,&rdquo; you explained while shrugging. &ldquo;This next forty-five minutes is gonna go by so slowly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I left mine at home too,&rdquo; Peter lied, knowing he had left them in the Avenger common room yesterday. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re both unlucky today.</p><p>You laughed. &ldquo;I guess so, Peter Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have any fun last weekend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With your friend,&rdquo; Peter said, clearing his throat. &ldquo;You mentioned you were seeing a friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah. I did, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Peter nodded. &ldquo;It was really fun, actually. He took me to this sandwich shop he likes and I are some pretty good food. I&rsquo;m sorry, you probably not want to hear that,&rdquo; you said, laughing as you shook your head.</p><p>&ldquo;You can tell me,&rdquo; Peter said with a genuine smile. &ldquo;I like it when you&rsquo;re happy.&rdquo;</p><p>His statement, bold as ever, shocked you but you were determined to not show how shocked you were to avoid embarrassing yourself.  </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually really sweet of you to say, Peter. Well, we don&rsquo;t really do much other than hang out,&rdquo; you said, leaving out the part where he often meets you and Tony Stark in the tower you were headed to. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s real nice. Gentle, even. That&rsquo;s not weird, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely not,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s, uh, it&rsquo;s nice that you&rsquo;ve found someone.&rdquo;</p><p>You paused. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re being friendly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, three weeks ago you practically ignoring me and now you&rsquo;re asking about my love life.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter laughed nervously. &ldquo;Ned helped shed some light on how I had been acting. I-I was a shit person to you and I&rsquo;m really sorry. I was going through some personal things in my life and couldn&rsquo;t handle another person knowing about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an excuse, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded once and decided that you&rsquo;d let go of all animosity towards Peter and how you felt about him beforehand. The pent up emotions were let go as soon as you and Spider-Man had admitted feelings for one another and somehow, being around Peter reminded you of the masked hero. With that in mind, you decided that you&rsquo;d focus your energy and attention on anything but hating Peter Parker.</p><p>The rest of the ride was quite pleasant and you accredited that to letting your wall against Peter crumble down the minute you had felt completely comfortable being around him. It was weird &mdash; you know that there was no reason for you to trust him and yet you sat there feeling like you had known Peter, really know him. His &lsquo;energy&rsquo; was familiar and it wasn&rsquo;t because you occasionally sat next to him during lunchtime. It wasn&rsquo;t because you hung out with him once with Ned. This was something else entirely and you weren&rsquo;t quite sure what it was. </p><p>When you arrived at Stark Tower, Mr. Harrington stood in front of the bus and urged everyone to be on their best behavior. You represented Midtown Tech, he reminded. Any of you could be working there in the future.</p><p>You filed out behind Ned and in front of Peter, who let you walk out the doors first. You looked at the familiar entrance and saw the usual bustling lobby you had grown accustomed to and the usual businessmen and businesswomen running late for meetings.  </p><p>The tour guide met your group by the front doors and &lsquo;debriefed&rsquo; the lot about procedures, rules, and what to do if there&rsquo;s an emergency that needed to be handled. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to my building,&rdquo; Tony greeted. His eyes scanned over the crowd and was pleasantly surprised to see both your face and Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s everything you expected and more.&rdquo;</p><p>A chorus of applause and happy murmurs were audible as Tony had granted access to a low level access laboratory that showcased what goes on in Stark Industry laboratories. The students milled around and looked at the people in white lab coats work on different projects (that were safe to be around, assured by Tony himself) and inspected daily work in the work space. Tony grinned at you when you caught his eye and saw that Natasha had snuck up to stand beside him. She gave you a wink and you gave her a shy wave before joining the rest of your class for the remaining portion of the tour.</p><p>&ldquo;This is so neat,&rdquo; Ned whisper-yelled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you see this stuff every day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not <i>every</i> day,&rdquo; Peter retorted. &ldquo;But, pretty much.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was itching to talk to Tony about the predicament he found himself in. His heart was beating much faster than when he was outside of the building but now it was spiking like there was no tomorrow. </p><p>He walked passed the students while trying to be discreet about needed to see Tony to talk to him about his senses and why they were going haywire more than usual. Yeah, Peter could sense if there was someone running behind him or when Ned was trying to sneak up on him, but this wasn&rsquo;t something he couldn&rsquo;t understand. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not now, kid,&rdquo; Tony said quietly. &ldquo;Come back after school.&rdquo; Peter sighed but nodded, knowing he wasn&rsquo;t going to get anything out of Tony even if he tried. </p><p>The rest of the tour guide consisted of viewing Tony&rsquo;s private office, meeting other Avengers and visiting superheroes, and talking with different technical experts. It was when Thor showed up at the end of the tour that made the crowd buzz.</p><p>&ldquo;Thor? I thought you were taking care of a project in Texas,&rdquo; Tony said, confused. </p><p>Thor chuckled. &ldquo;I got back a few minutes ago when Natasha told me Midtown Tech was visiting.&rdquo; He nodded his head at Peter, who laughed nervously. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi Thor!&rdquo; you heard a girl from your group yell out. </p><p>You and Peter simultaneously rolled your eyes and shared a quiet laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking you all could try to lift this old thing,&rdquo; he said while holding up Mjolnir. &ldquo;I doubt any of you could lift it but it&rsquo;ll be funny to see you try.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds entertaining,&rdquo; Tony said casually before looking at Mr. Harrington for permission, to which your teacher nodded out of both confusion and in awe. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set it down here,&rdquo; Thor said, putting Mjolnir in the middle of an unoccupied furnished room. &ldquo;So, who wants to try first?&rdquo; Almost half of the class ran up to be first in line and made a makeshift queue. </p><p>&ldquo;You gonna try?&rdquo; you asked Peter, leaning over to whisper.</p><p>He shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably give it a go,&rdquo; he said, knowing he had already tried to pick up Mjolnir up several times. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, definitely,&rdquo; you replied. &ldquo;I know that nothing&rsquo;s going to happen but I really want to say I lifted the hammer at least once in my lifetime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter! Watch me lift it!&rdquo; Ned shouted to grab Peter&rsquo;s attention. Peter laughed and watched as Ned struggled to lift the hammer and heaved a heavy sigh when he was unable to. </p><p>&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; said Ned. He shook his head in feigned disappointment. &ldquo;Peter, you should try!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter only laughed, knowing he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pick it up. Thor patted Peter on the back and watched as another student failed to lift the hammer.</p><p>&ldquo;Good try,&rdquo; Thor commented. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; Ned said in excitement. </p><p>You took a deep breath and felt that your palms were suddenly sweating, but shook the confusion out of your head and blamed your nervousness on the thirty odd pairs of eyes watching you at once. </p><p>But when your hands went to grip the black handles of the sacred hammer, your palms tingled and you felt a burning sensation against your skin and abruptly let go of it with a startled gasp. The room flickered as the room shook slightly before the power turned out, leaving a state of panic within the students in the room.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y, turn the lights back on,&rdquo; said Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Working on turning the backup generator as we speak,&rdquo; she replied. The students in the room collectively gasped at the seemingly unknown voice echoing through the room. &ldquo;I should warn you that the entire building has lost power.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s taking so long,&rdquo; Tony cursed. &ldquo;Thor, get your hammer off the ground.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M-My hands,&rdquo; you stuttered, looking down to see that the sun from outside was shining through the clear glass, showcasing tour singed hands that were slightly pink yet felt like it was to the point of burning. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, it&rsquo;s Y/N!&rdquo; Peter shouted, looking at your still body while the other students were running and screaming in havoc. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s ears perked up and he looked to you standing in the middle of the room, looking down at your hands with a confused expression written all over your face. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; Tony said, worried as he rushed to your side. &ldquo;Natasha, get everyone out of the building! Pete, come with me.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony brought you to another room where it was quieter. The backup generator seemed to be working because the lights turned on when Tony flipped the switch. He saw your hands turning a shade of red and wasted no time to grab two ice packs and wrap them in paper towels, preparing to bandage them to your palms. </p><p>You, on the other hand, felt like you had lightning coursing through your entire body. It felt like of electricity were pulsing inside of you and bursts of fire were looking at your palms, which the ice packs were help subduing.</p><p>&ldquo;T-Tony,&rdquo; you sniffles as he taped your bandage in place. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I need you to grab some sanitizing wipes,&rdquo; Tony instructed. </p><p>&ldquo;On it,&rdquo; Peter said without thinking and opened a drawer and handed Tony the wipes. The meticulous man standing in front of you sat you down on one of the medical tables and stood in front of you, cleaning the small amount of blood that had seeped from your palms. </p><p>You shut your eyes at the burning sensation internally and the stinging sensation of the sanitizing wipes Tony used on your hands. But you attention was turned from your pain to how Peter knew where the wipes were.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; you asked, confused. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I asked him to be here,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d want to see a familiar face.&rdquo; He opted not to tell you about his identity as Spider-Man but had an itch that you were about find out. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I,&rdquo; Tony stammered.&nbsp;&ldquo;You need to see something.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Wordlessly, Tony pulled up a device that projected a file docket with the headline&nbsp;&lsquo;Y/N Stark,&rsquo; reading the information underneath it. You saw that your blood sample had been tested against Tony&rsquo;s a few days after you have given a few samples of your blood and it was a positive match when tested against his DNA.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God,&rdquo; you whispered to yourself, looking between the projected image and Tony. Peter stood in the background, just as confused as you.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your father, Y/N. I&rsquo;ve known this for a couple of weeks now,&rdquo; he explained calmly, not looking you in the eye.&nbsp;</p><p>The room was silent. You could hear the heavy breaths of Peter and Tony, and you could feel their eyes staring at you while they awaited your reaction and what you were going to say next.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you asked yourself in a quiet whisper. The more you stared at the docket, the more you couldn&rsquo;t believe that the man you had been searching for had been right under your nose the entire time, consoling you about your feelings about your lost father.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he started.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please say something.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; you asked with a snap, looking him in the eye as you spoke before looking back to your bandaged hands.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find the strength,&rdquo; Tony said.&nbsp;&ldquo;You were standing right in front of me and I didn&rsquo;t know how to break the news to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you sat there!&rdquo; you exclaimed with hot tears on the tip of your nose. You could feel yourself needing to take a breather but the last thing on your mind was relaxing.&nbsp;&ldquo;You sat there and told me I&rsquo;d find my father when you <i>knew </i>you were him. You lied to me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I-I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tony replied.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You did, Tony!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He gulped and took a deep breath before holding you in between his arms, his hands on either side of your arms.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been searching for you for seventeen years. I&rsquo;ve done everything I could to look for your mother and it&rsquo;s been a dead end search until the day you gave me your DNA sample.&rdquo; Tony looked at you with desperation.&nbsp;&ldquo;I found you, Y/N. After seventeen years of looking for you I finally found you.&rdquo;</p><p>You took a deep breath as Tony pleaded with you to forgive him for not saying anything because after seventeen years, he hadn&rsquo;t gathered the words or the courage to tell you he was your father. All the times you had visited his tower was a chance for him to come clean and yet he could never physically get himself to speak whenever you were around.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo; you asked tentatively, your voice cracking and your eyes watering more than they were.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Y/N. It&rsquo;s always been me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite your aching body and hands, you gathered the strength to put your arms around Tony&rsquo;s shoulder and leaned into him where you put all your weight and trust into the man who you had idolized since you were a young girl. The man who you had wished was your father when you were younger was <i>actually </i>your father and you didn&rsquo;t have to worry about looking for him anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t imagine what you went through,&rdquo; you said to Tony after he had pulled away.&nbsp;&ldquo;Seventeen years of your life was spent looking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was worth it,&rdquo; he admitted.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was worth getting to see the smile on your face when you first walked in here. It was worth telling you today because you don&rsquo;t hate me.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed at his attempt to make a lighthearted joke in a heavy situation, something that your mother had always accused you of doing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My mom,&rdquo; you said.&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always telling me that my father was a lowlife, sometimes that he was a druggie, or that he was someone who never cared about me but she was wrong.&rdquo; You let out a cry and Tony rushed to hug you once more.&nbsp;</p><p>Feeling perplexed at the woman who had loved him and then left without a note, Tony&rsquo;s initial feeling in his gut was to tell you to leave your mother and stay with him in the tower where things were safe. You didn&rsquo;t have to worry about unresolved feelings and you two could get to know each other without interruption.&nbsp;</p><p>But all his feelings dissolved when he took one look at your face. His thoughts weren&rsquo;t in his own interests anymore, but in yours. With a change of heart (a reluctant one), he let his hand move loose strands from your face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Talk to her,&rdquo; he urged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell her you know I&rsquo;m your father. Ask her why she did what she did and maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you whispered.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You can.&rdquo; Tony held your hands in his carefully and nodded at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;You deserve the truth, not another mystery after you&rsquo;ve solved one already.&rdquo;</p><p>For the sake of your new relationship with Tony, you agreed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And now for the elephant in the room,&rdquo; you said bitterly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>Your head whipped to the boy who was standing in the sidelines and Tony looked between you two, deciding it was better to leave you alone. He stroked your cheek and told you he&rsquo;d be outside, cleaning up the mess that had ensued until you were ready to go home.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How could you?&rdquo; you asked him once Tony had left the room.&nbsp;&ldquo;You manipulated me, Peter. You made me believe that you hated me while kissing me as Spider-Man. Then you made me feel guilty and confused once you decided to be nice to me as Peter Parker.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me you liked me as Spider-Man but ran away from me as Peter Parker. We <i>kissed </i>in my bedroom, Peter! Y-You made me think that we were friends when we aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Y/N, you don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; you said, shaking your head is disbelief. You stood up from the medical bed and winced at the sudden movement, suddenly feeling the electric jolts in your body again.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just need time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, please,&rdquo; Peter pleaded.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; you snapped, annoyed at Peter and at your body acting up again.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need time to think and process what I just learned. You&rsquo;re Spider-Man, for crying out loud!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I wanted to tell you but I didn&rsquo;t know how, considering you hated Peter Parker,&rdquo; he retorted.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Because all you did was ignore me, Peter. From the minute I stepped foot into Midtown until Ned asked me to hang out with you guys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;,&rdquo; he pleaded. You walked out the door and Peter watched as your figure left. He sighed and watched as Tony ran after you without giving him a spare glance. Peter rubbed his face in his hands, not knowing whether or not you two would ever be on speaking terms again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Peter asked Tony when he went outside. There, Tony and Thor had been talking feverishly when Peter walked in.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her,&rdquo; Thor said.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The half human, half Asgardian,&rdquo; Thor explained.&nbsp;&ldquo;About seventeen years ago, my father exiled a woman for creating a child that was half human and half Asgardian in fear that the child would one day rise up and try to destroy Asgard. We&rsquo;ve just found the child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, Y/N? There&rsquo;s no way,&rdquo; Peter begun, not convincing himself.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the Light Bringer,&rdquo; said Thor.&nbsp;&ldquo;She kept the peace in the Asgardian council and, to you humans, was the person who brought fire to Earth. That&rsquo;s why we call her Light Bringer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rsquo;s an Asgardian?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As far as I know, yes,&rdquo; Thor said in all seriousness.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony rubbed his chin and sighed heavily, not knowing what to make of the situation that had unfolded in front of him. Thor, having found someone that he had been close to twenty years ago, was over the moon.&nbsp;</p><p>All Peter knew was that his spidey senses had finally stopped.</p><p>***</p><p>Your apartment smelled like oregano when you entered.</p><p>It was almost five in the afternoon and your mother was standing in the kitchen, stirring a pot when she turned around and glanced over her shoulder to see you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How was your field trip?&rdquo; she asked. She stopped stirring when she saw your hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;My goodness, Y/N. What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me Tony Stark is my father?&rdquo; you asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; she began.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was for your own protection.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You lied to me!&rdquo; you shouted, causing your mother to cease her actions and turn the stove off to prevent the food from burning.&nbsp;&ldquo;Of all the times I&rsquo;ve asked about my dad, you lied each time I asked.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;To protect you,&rdquo; your mother reiterated.&nbsp;&ldquo;I lied for your safety.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You were silent.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And for him.&rdquo;</p><p>Confused, you sighed and sat down, letting your head rest in between your arms before taking the bandages off.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I touched Thor&rsquo;s hammer today,&rdquo; you began.&nbsp;&ldquo;I touched the hammer and then my hands burned, and the next thing I know, Tony Stark&rsquo;s telling me he&rsquo;s my dad.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Your mother&rsquo;s head whipped.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You touched <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>You shot her an annoyed expression.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mjolnir. Thor&rsquo;s weapon?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Your mother sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N, there&rsquo;s something I need to tell you. Wait right here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You watched as your mother disappeared around the corner and waited for an explanation as you tapped your leg. She was gone all for a minute before coming back with a long necklace and a pendant attached at the end, sliding it to where you sat before taking a seat at the corner next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;My mother gave this to me as a present when I was born,&rdquo; she began.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gift that&rsquo;s been passed down from generation to generation and I was going to give it to you when you were born.&nbsp;But as you know, your father was never present in your life and it&rsquo;s because I left him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you do that?&rdquo; you asked her. Your mother pursed her lips as she heaved a heavy sigh and closed her eyes. She opened them to see you staring at her with a blank expression.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not from Portland, Y/N. This pendant,&rdquo; she said, holding up the necklace,&nbsp;&ldquo;is supposed to protect the owner of the necklace. It lets Asgardians find you whenever and wherever you need help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A-Asgardians?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;I came here twenty years ago and met your father, Tony, at one of his charity events. I was sent to Midgard, Earth, by Odin to check in on one of the planets he had been keeping tabs on. I was supposed to be here for six months before returning but I met Tony before I was supposed to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;I spent a good two years with him, traveling back and forth from Earth to Asgard. I told Tony it was business trips and Odin that I was keeping a close eye on Earth like he had asked me to do. Only, he found out that I was pregnant with you and exiled me from Asgard and swore to eliminate the half human and half Asgardian.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You eyes widened at her confessions and waited for her to speak again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This pendant would&rsquo;ve activated your powers,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I got rid of anything from Asagrd because it would&rsquo;ve activated your powers and sent Odin on a path that would lead him to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; she began,&nbsp;&ldquo;the day I found out I was pregnant with you was the happiest day of my life and having to leave Tony was the worst. I didn&rsquo;t tell you because your life would&rsquo;ve been in actual danger and now that Valkyrie&rsquo;s leading Asgard, I don&rsquo;t think I have to worry about that anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you keep this from me if you knew I wasn&rsquo;t in danger anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t know if I still had to look over my shoulder,&rdquo; your mother said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I spent a long time worrying about our lives and yes, twenty years is a blink of an eye to Asgardians, but not when you&rsquo;re protecting someone you love.&rdquo;</p><p>You sat for a moment in silence and she waited for you to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t appreciate the lies,&rdquo; you said.&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I appreciate you protecting me, mom. I know you do so much for me that I don&rsquo;t know and I love you so much. I&rsquo;ll always love you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You stood up and walked to where she was sitting and wrapped your arms around her in a forgiving hug, letting her know that all the secrets she had been harboring wasn&rsquo;t something you were going to hold against her. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she whispered as you pulled away. She wiped some tears from her cheeks and chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a mess, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mom, mom. You say that as if I&rsquo;m not. Hey, does this mean you&rsquo;re going to outlive me?&rdquo;</p><p>She chuckled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not think about that right now. By the way, if we&rsquo;re laying out secrets in the table, there&rsquo;s something else I think you should know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; you asked with a raised eyebrow. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeing someone for the past few weeks,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;We were just friends for a while but we&rsquo;re testing the waters right now. I-I really want you to meet her.&rdquo; </p><p>You watched as your mother tried to suppress a smile but failed when she imagined the thought of two people she loved meeting for the first time.</p><p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s mystery woman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; you teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when or where yet but I wanted you to know about her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I should tell you about Peter,&rdquo; you said, sighing.</p><p>&ldquo;The boy who doesn&rsquo;t like you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t like me but now I think he does? Anyway, you&rsquo;re Asgardian and since that&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t think you want people finding out, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll tell anyone what I&rsquo;m about to tell you.&rdquo; She gestured for you to continue. &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s Spider-Man and we kind of have a thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that why you&rsquo;ve been so happy lately?&rdquo; she asked with a quirked eyebrow. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you said with a blush. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the thing. We confessed our feelings to each other but I confessed it to Spider-Man, only to realize it was Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why is that such a bad thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because Peter made me feel like he didn&rsquo;t like me when he was Peter Parker but made me feel like the luckiest girl on Earth as Spider-Man.&rdquo; Your mother thought for a moment before speaking. </p><p>&ldquo;I think this is something you should ask Tony,&rdquo; she advised. &ldquo;I can give you all the boy drama advice you want but this is something so specific that only Tony can answer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that a good idea?&rdquo;</p><p>She shrugged. &ldquo;Hell if I know. But he probably knows more than I do and it&rsquo;ll give him a chance to bond with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad?&rdquo; you asked. &ldquo;Or even slightly concerned that I want to get to know Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I still love him, Y/N. I do. Not in the way I did twenty years ago, but I still care for him and he deserves to know the daughter he looked for for over seventeen years. I owe him at least that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you breathed. &ldquo;But Peter is like, his protege. Plus, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ready to trust Peter again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be ready,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s going to fix itself unless you do something about it. You clearly have feelings for this Peter person, so what better way to clear the air than get advice from someone who knows him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; you said with a grin. &ldquo;Thanks, mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; You began walking out of the kitchen but popped your head back in.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So does that mean you know Loki and Thor?&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>taglist:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM9vm2_2UHQrZ8s3TBOow7g\">@kath94210</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7LLktNYy6UNWt2fhwblFcw\">@sessi03</a>
