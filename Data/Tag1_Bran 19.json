I dont care whether I like it or not because I mind my own damn business and leave you alone.\nI'm open minded to multiple ships in one fandom because why the fuck not? That doesn't mean I don't have an OTP I'm just chill.\nXemnas/Sora shipper since KH2 came out.\nI write.\nI make videos sometimes.\nI post my friend's art for her since she doesn't have a tumblr.\nI reblog whatever is my fancy. I also get random mood changes and spam random things straight. Oops. \nI will most likely post something REALLY clever every so often.",

You may have been a girl from the North, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you had to love the cold.</p><p>\u201cThe lilies are beginning to bloom,\u201d you said with a gesture to the pink blossoms.\u00a0\u201cThey look so beautiful.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you, my dear,\u201d replied your fiance Bran. As Queen-To-Be you took it upon yourself to brighten up the Red Keep yourself. While the builders worked on restoring the inside of the building, you got your hands dirty in the garden. You may have earned yourself a sunburn or two, but you didn\u2019t mind so long as something beautiful could grow again in King\u2019s Landing. After the battle most of the plants were destroyed, either burned or covered in ash and debris. Finally, the new seeds were blooming vibrantly.<br/></p><p>As you came to the end of the garden path you saw a short figure making his way towards the two of you.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion, how lovely to see you on this fine morning.\u201d You say with a smile. Tyrion smiles a small smile in return.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt is lovely to see you as well, Lady Y/N. I would like to congratulate you on how the garden is coming, I must admit that the lavender blooms are my favorite.\u201d You beamed at the compliment.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not just here to admire your handiwork though, I have come to remind your fiance about the small council meeting that started nearly twenty minutes ago.\u201d He shot a sharp look at Bran.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d You exclaimed as you flushed.\u00a0\u201cThat was all my fault! I lost track of time showing Bran around the gardens, I am so sorry Tyrion.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Darling, I forgot as well.\u201d Said Bran comfortingly, looking up at you with those deep eyes you loved yo much. He reached back to grab your hand in his. Tyrion looked at Bran knowingly; Bran does not forget.<br/></p><p>Podrick came up to assist Bran to the small council chamber, and you began making your way through the castle. While your future husband worked on fixing the political climate of the six kingdoms, you took it upon yourself to renew the beauty of the Red Keep and King\u2019s Landing. You made many trips around the halls, looking for projects to be done. Just last week you had commissioned a series of paintings to hang in the new throne room when it was finished. You wanted scenes of the war to be depicted, both good and bad. This way future generations would have a reminder of the horror right in the room in which they ruled.</p><p>As you meandered down the corridors for a considerable amount of time until you began to hear a small commotion coming from one of the rooms. The closer you got to the room, the more apparent it became that it was full of ladies from the court, chattering and occasionally roaring with laughter. You had never really fit in with the rest of the ladies, but you figured it was worth a shot to try. After all, as Queen you would have to interact with these ladies much more frequently. You began to enter the room, but stopped dead in your tracks as their words found their way to your ears.</p><p>\u201cI bet he doesn\u2019t really even like her,\u201d said one of the ladies as the rest had giggled. <i>They could be talking about anyone,</i>\u00a0you reminded yourself from your place in the doorway. However, you had a knowing, sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach. You decided to listen in but not move, as they had not noticed you quite yet.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t!\u201d Yelled one women as they all erupted into chuckles.\u00a0\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like anyone! He\u2019s the\u00a0\u2018three-eyed-raven\u2019 who doesn\u2019t want!\u201d The woman did a horrendous impression of Bran at the end, making tears spring to your eyes. Not only were they mocking Bran, but also speaking of his false love for you.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want, how could he want her? If he is just choosing at random, he could have at least chosen somebody beautiful.\u201d The tears threatened to slip.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if she is so stupid that she is unaware of how insincere his affection towards her.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd it is as if you are all so stupid that you are unaware of your surroundings,\u201d you said, mustering all your courage so that it did not sound as if you were on the verge of tears. It worked, making all the ladies turn towards you with a gasp. Their reaction spurred you on, taking on a cold demeanor.\u00a0\u201cYou speak of the future Queen behind her back as if she is not there. Though, of course, you had assumed that I was not. Perhaps you should have taken notice of who was entering the room instead of carrying on like children.\u201d<br/></p><p>Despite gossiping about you mere seconds ago, this shift in your personality left them speechless and wide-eyed. You held the power, and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cDo not talk about me and my husband-to-be like this again, or there will be consequences.\u201d Your delivery rivaled even Cersei\u2019s, surprising you with just how cold and calculated the words sounded coming from your lips. The ladies nodded, hurrying to leave the room.\u00a0<br/></p><p>As they left, you too began the walk back to your chambers. It was getting rather late anyway, and the sun was beginning its descent through the sky as the moon began to appear. You slowly made your way back down the corridor to your bedroom. With every step you took, the bravado began to fade and the doubt began to surge through your mind again. The ladies were right. As the Three-Eyed-Raven, Bran was free from earthly wants and desires. It is what made him a good King; he is not selfish or greedy.\u00a0 But you had not thought about what that meant for the two of you.</p><p>You had met as children, running around and getting into loads of trouble when your father would make his monthly visits to Winterfell. House (L/N) may be a small house, but it is a house of proud Northerners who used their closeness to the Lord and Lady Stark to their advantage. You looked back on those memories fondly. Bran and you would always climb anything you could get your hands and feet on, and you would always have to endure a scolding from your father afterwards. You never minded the trouble, so long as you got to hang out with your best friend.\u00a0</p><p>When you heard of Bran\u2019s fall, you fell to your knees and cried. You thought that your friend would die. By some miracle of the Gods he did not, and you went to visit him as he lie in bed. You were told he would never walk again, and you knew that your climbing days were over. You didn\u2019t mind. All you wanted was to spend time with him, whatever way you could.</p><p>The visits to the Starks became less frequent after Ned left for King\u2019s Landing. After his execution, your father raced to Winterfell to help Robb and his army in any way that he could. You got to accompany him, but after Theon returned to take Winterfell you were whisked away to the Riverlands. You were informed of Bran and Rickard\u2019s passing weeks later, falling into a deep lull for many months.</p><p>As Sansa and the other Starks returned to Winterfell years later, you returned as well. You reunited with Bran, feeling something special spark as your eyes landed on him for the first time in years. It was more than just seeing an old friend. In fact, it was even more than just seeing your best childhood friend who you had believed was dead for years It was as if you were seeing your soulmate.</p><p>Now looking back on that memory, the way you felt, you realized that it may have been one-sided. You knew that he did not desire as he had before disappearing behind the wall, but you thought that you were different. You thought that he had loved you. Maybe instead he was able to read you like a book, realizing that you would be the easiest to have by his side because you would be there out of devotion instead of greed. Perhaps you were merely the most convenient.</p><p>Tears made their way from your eyes and down your cheeks as you finally reached the door, closing it behind you. To your surprise, Bran was already inside. You must have wandered the castle halls for longer than you thought. He turned his chair from where he had been sitting at the window so that he could face you.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong, my dear?\u201d He asked, using his arms to wheel his way over to you. Despite your obvious unhappiness, you did not want to admit to him your weakness.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Bran,\u2019 you replied. He cocked his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou never call me that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell it is your name.\u201d<br/></p><p>You began to get ready for bed, feeling Bran\u2019s eyes on you as you did so.</p><p>\u201cMy love, I cannot help you unless you tell me what is wrong.\u201d He said. You could hear the pain in his voice.<br/></p><p>\u201cAs if you couldn\u2019t just read my mind,\u201d you retort hotly. Bran let out a sigh.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know that I promised never to do that to you, Y/N. You know that I love you and I respect your privacy. I would never use my greensight against you to see what has happened to make you so upset. I want you to tell me yourself if you decide to of your own accord.\u201d<br/></p><p>You took a deep, shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cBut do you?\u201d You asked. Bran furrowed his brows.</p><p>\u201cDo I what, Y/N?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou said you love me. Do you?\u201d The tears began again, leaving hot trails on your face. His face fell. He reached out to you, pulling you to him so that you sat sideways across his lap. He held you with one arm as he wiped the tears as they fell from your eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, my dear. You are so special to me. You are a light shining in my life every day and I am lucky to be able to call you my own. What would make you think that I may feel any other way about you?\u201d Bran stared into your eyes and you knew he was telling the truth. His eyes were full of love and devotion, and you knew it. You leaned against his chest.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Three-Eyed-Raven,\u201d you say.<br/></p><p>\u201cDoes that make me any less your fiance as well?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, but it means that you do not have wants as normal people do.\u201d<br/></p><p>Realizing what you thought, Bran pulling you into a tight hug, caressing your hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are right Y/N, I do not desire things as I did before I was pushed from that tower. But that does not mean that I do not desire you.\u201d<br/></p><p>You pulled back from him, looking into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI may not want land, or wealth, or power, and I may not desire in the same way. But you, my darling,\u201d said Bran, looking at you with admiration,\u00a0\u201care my exception. I want you more than anyone could ever want anything. The first time I saw you again after the start of the war I felt something change in me. You sparked desire that I thought I could never feel. I have full faith that fate brought us together, whether because I am the Three-Eyed-Raven or in spite of that. I do love you Y/N, with all of my heart.\u201d<br/></p><p>You crashed your lips to Bran\u2019s, his moving in sync with yours as you moved your body to straddle him instead of sitting sideways.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too Bran,\u201d you said between kisses as you pulled back for air. He wheeled the two of you towards the bed that you shared, making you squeal and wrap your arms around his neck so that you wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201cCome love, let\u2019s get into bed so that I may lay with the woman I love. My fiancee.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBran, that was rather cheesy. Especially for you.\u201d He smiled up at you as you helped him into bed, sliding in beside him and letting his arms wrap around you.</p><p>\u201cBut you loved it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMy love, if you don\u2019t hush up I won\u2019t help you get up in the morning and you\u2019ll be stuck here all day.\u201d You retort with a blush.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel woman,\u201d he teased.\u00a0\u201cBut I love you anyway.\u201d<br/></p><p>You turned to face him and see his smiling face. You snuggled closer to his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you too, my dear.\u201d<br/></p>",

Perhaps you were merely the most convenient.</p><p>Tears made their way from your eyes and down your cheeks as you finally reached the door, closing it behind you. To your surprise, Bran was already inside. You must have wandered the castle halls for longer than you thought. He turned his chair from where he had been sitting at the window so that he could face you.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong, my dear?\u201d He asked, using his arms to wheel his way over to you. Despite your obvious unhappiness, you did not want to admit to him your weakness.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Bran,\u2019 you replied. He cocked his head.<br></p><p>\u201cYou never call me that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell it is your name.\u201d<br></p><p>You began to get ready for bed, feeling Bran\u2019s eyes on you as you did so.</p><p>\u201cMy love, I cannot help you unless you tell me what is wrong.\u201d He said. You could hear the pain in his voice.<br></p><p>\u201cAs if you couldn\u2019t just read my mind,\u201d you retort hotly. Bran let out a sigh.<br></p><p>\u201cYou know that I promised never to do that to you, Y/N. You know that I love you and I respect your privacy. I would never use my greensight against you to see what has happened to make you so upset. I want you to tell me yourself if you decide to of your own accord.\u201d<br></p><p>You took a deep, shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cBut do you?\u201d You asked. Bran furrowed his brows.</p><p>\u201cDo I what, Y/N?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou said you love me. Do you?\u201d The tears began again, leaving hot trails on your face. His face fell. He reached out to you, pulling you to him so that you sat sideways across his lap. He held you with one arm as he wiped the tears as they fell from your eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, my dear. You are so special to me. You are a light shining in my life every day and I am lucky to be able to call you my own. What would make you think that I may feel any other way about you?\u201d Bran stared into your eyes and you knew he was telling the truth. His eyes were full of love and devotion, and you knew it. You leaned against his chest.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Three-Eyed-Raven,\u201d you say.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes that make me any less your fiance as well?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, but it means that you do not have wants as normal people do.\u201d<br></p><p>Realizing what you thought, Bran pulling you into a tight hug, caressing your hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are right Y/N, I do not desire things as I did before I was pushed from that tower. But that does not mean that I do not desire you.\u201d<br></p><p>You pulled back from him, looking into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI may not want land, or wealth, or power, and I may not desire in the same way. But you, my darling,\u201d said Bran, looking at you with admiration,\u00a0\u201care my exception. I want you more than anyone could ever want anything. The first time I saw you again after the start of the war I felt something change in me. You sparked desire that I thought I could never feel. I have full faith that fate brought us together, whether because I am the Three-Eyed-Raven or in spite of that. I do love you Y/N, with all of my heart.\u201d<br></p><p>You crashed your lips to Bran\u2019s, his moving in sync with yours as you moved your body to straddle him instead of sitting sideways.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too Bran,\u201d you said between kisses as you pulled back for air. He wheeled the two of you towards the bed that you shared, making you squeal and wrap your arms around his neck so that you wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201cCome love, let\u2019s get into bed so that I may lay with the woman I love. My fiancee.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBran, that was rather cheesy. Especially for you.\u201d He smiled up at you as you helped him into bed, sliding in beside him and letting his arms wrap around you.</p><p>\u201cBut you loved it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMy love, if you don\u2019t hush up I won\u2019t help you get up in the morning and you\u2019ll be stuck here all day.\u201d You retort with a blush.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel woman,\u201d he teased.\u00a0\u201cBut I love you anyway.\u201d<br></p><p>You turned to face him and see his smiling face. You snuggled closer to his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you too, my dear.\u201d<br></p>",

You may have been a girl from the North, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you had to love the cold.</p><p>\u201cThe lilies are beginning to bloom,\u201d you said with a gesture to the pink blossoms.\u00a0\u201cThey look so beautiful.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you, my dear,\u201d replied your fiance Bran. As Queen-To-Be you took it upon yourself to brighten up the Red Keep yourself. While the builders worked on restoring the inside of the building, you got your hands dirty in the garden. You may have earned yourself a sunburn or two, but you didn\u2019t mind so long as something beautiful could grow again in King\u2019s Landing. After the battle most of the plants were destroyed, either burned or covered in ash and debris. Finally, the new seeds were blooming vibrantly.<br></p><p>As you came to the end of the garden path you saw a short figure making his way towards the two of you.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion, how lovely to see you on this fine morning.\u201d You say with a smile. Tyrion smiles a small smile in return.<br></p><p>\u201cIt is lovely to see you as well, Lady Y/N. I would like to congratulate you on how the garden is coming, I must admit that the lavender blooms are my favorite.\u201d You beamed at the compliment.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not just here to admire your handiwork though, I have come to remind your fiance about the small council meeting that started nearly twenty minutes ago.\u201d He shot a sharp look at Bran.<br></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d You exclaimed as you flushed.\u00a0\u201cThat was all my fault! I lost track of time showing Bran around the gardens, I am so sorry Tyrion.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Darling, I forgot as well.\u201d Said Bran comfortingly, looking up at you with those deep eyes you loved yo much. He reached back to grab your hand in his. Tyrion looked at Bran knowingly; Bran does not forget.<br></p><p>Podrick came up to assist Bran to the small council chamber, and you began making your way through the castle. While your future husband worked on fixing the political climate of the six kingdoms, you took it upon yourself to renew the beauty of the Red Keep and King\u2019s Landing. You made many trips around the halls, looking for projects to be done. Just last week you had commissioned a series of paintings to hang in the new throne room when it was finished. You wanted scenes of the war to be depicted, both good and bad. This way future generations would have a reminder of the horror right in the room in which they ruled.</p><p>As you meandered down the corridors for a considerable amount of time until you began to hear a small commotion coming from one of the rooms. The closer you got to the room, the more apparent it became that it was full of ladies from the court, chattering and occasionally roaring with laughter. You had never really fit in with the rest of the ladies, but you figured it was worth a shot to try. After all, as Queen you would have to interact with these ladies much more frequently. You began to enter the room, but stopped dead in your tracks as their words found their way to your ears.</p><p>\u201cI bet he doesn\u2019t really even like her,\u201d said one of the ladies as the rest had giggled. <i>They could be talking about anyone,</i>\u00a0you reminded yourself from your place in the doorway. However, you had a knowing, sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach. You decided to listen in but not move, as they had not noticed you quite yet.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t!\u201d Yelled one women as they all erupted into chuckles.\u00a0\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like anyone! He\u2019s the\u00a0\u2018three-eyed-raven\u2019 who doesn\u2019t want!\u201d The woman did a horrendous impression of Bran at the end, making tears spring to your eyes. Not only were they mocking Bran, but also speaking of his false love for you.<br></p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want, how could he want her? If he is just choosing at random, he could have at least chosen somebody beautiful.\u201d The tears threatened to slip.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if she is so stupid that she is unaware of how insincere his affection towards her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd it is as if you are all so stupid that you are unaware of your surroundings,\u201d you said, mustering all your courage so that it did not sound as if you were on the verge of tears. It worked, making all the ladies turn towards you with a gasp. Their reaction spurred you on, taking on a cold demeanor.\u00a0\u201cYou speak of the future Queen behind her back as if she is not there. Though, of course, you had assumed that I was not. Perhaps you should have taken notice of who was entering the room instead of carrying on like children.\u201d<br></p><p>Despite gossiping about you mere seconds ago, this shift in your personality left them speechless and wide-eyed. You held the power, and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cDo not talk about me and my husband-to-be like this again, or there will be consequences.\u201d Your delivery rivaled even Cersei\u2019s, surprising you with just how cold and calculated the words sounded coming from your lips. The ladies nodded, hurrying to leave the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>As they left, you too began the walk back to your chambers. It was getting rather late anyway, and the sun was beginning its descent through the sky as the moon began to appear. You slowly made your way back down the corridor to your bedroom. With every step you took, the bravado began to fade and the doubt began to surge through your mind again. The ladies were right. As the Three-Eyed-Raven, Bran was free from earthly wants and desires. It is what made him a good King; he is not selfish or greedy.\u00a0 But you had not thought about what that meant for the two of you.</p><p>You had met as children, running around and getting into loads of trouble when your father would make his monthly visits to Winterfell. House (L/N) may be a small house, but it is a house of proud Northerners who used their closeness to the Lord and Lady Stark to their advantage. You looked back on those memories fondly. Bran and you would always climb anything you could get your hands and feet on, and you would always have to endure a scolding from your father afterwards. You never minded the trouble, so long as you got to hang out with your best friend.\u00a0</p><p>When you heard of Bran\u2019s fall, you fell to your knees and cried. You thought that your friend would die. By some miracle of the Gods he did not, and you went to visit him as he lie in bed. You were told he would never walk again, and you knew that your climbing days were over. You didn\u2019t mind. All you wanted was to spend time with him, whatever way you could.</p><p>The visits to the Starks became less frequent after Ned left for King\u2019s Landing. After his execution, your father raced to Winterfell to help Robb and his army in any way that he could. You got to accompany him, but after Theon returned to take Winterfell you were whisked away to the Riverlands. You were informed of Bran and Rickard\u2019s passing weeks later, falling into a deep lull for many months.</p><p>As Sansa and the other Starks returned to Winterfell years later, you returned as well. You reunited with Bran, feeling something special spark as your eyes landed on him for the first time in years. It was more than just seeing an old friend. In fact, it was even more than just seeing your best childhood friend who you had believed was dead for years It was as if you were seeing your soulmate.</p><p>Now looking back on that memory, the way you felt, you realized that it may have been one-sided. You knew that he did not desire as he had before disappearing behind the wall, but you thought that you were different. You thought that he had loved you. Maybe instead he was able to read you like a book, realizing that you would be the easiest to have by his side because you would be there out of devotion instead of greed. Perhaps you were merely the most convenient.</p><p>Tears made their way from your eyes and down your cheeks as you finally reached the door, closing it behind you. To your surprise, Bran was already inside. You must have wandered the castle halls for longer than you thought. He turned his chair from where he had been sitting at the window so that he could face you.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong, my dear?\u201d He asked, using his arms to wheel his way over to you.

If he is just choosing at random, he could have at least chosen somebody beautiful.&rdquo; The tears threatened to slip.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if she is so stupid that she is unaware of how insincere his affection towards her.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And it is as if you are all so stupid that you are unaware of your surroundings,&rdquo; you said, mustering all your courage so that it did not sound as if you were on the verge of tears. It worked, making all the ladies turn towards you with a gasp. Their reaction spurred you on, taking on a cold demeanor.&nbsp;&ldquo;You speak of the future Queen behind her back as if she is not there. Though, of course, you had assumed that I was not. Perhaps you should have taken notice of who was entering the room instead of carrying on like children.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Despite gossiping about you mere seconds ago, this shift in your personality left them speechless and wide-eyed. You held the power, and they all knew it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not talk about me and my husband-to-be like this again, or there will be consequences.&rdquo; Your delivery rivaled even Cersei&rsquo;s, surprising you with just how cold and calculated the words sounded coming from your lips. The ladies nodded, hurrying to leave the room.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>As they left, you too began the walk back to your chambers. It was getting rather late anyway, and the sun was beginning its descent through the sky as the moon began to appear. You slowly made your way back down the corridor to your bedroom. With every step you took, the bravado began to fade and the doubt began to surge through your mind again. The ladies were right. As the Three-Eyed-Raven, Bran was free from earthly wants and desires. It is what made him a good King; he is not selfish or greedy.&nbsp; But you had not thought about what that meant for the two of you.</p><p>You had met as children, running around and getting into loads of trouble when your father would make his monthly visits to Winterfell. House (L/N) may be a small house, but it is a house of proud Northerners who used their closeness to the Lord and Lady Stark to their advantage. You looked back on those memories fondly. Bran and you would always climb anything you could get your hands and feet on, and you would always have to endure a scolding from your father afterwards. You never minded the trouble, so long as you got to hang out with your best friend.&nbsp;</p><p>When you heard of Bran&rsquo;s fall, you fell to your knees and cried. You thought that your friend would die. By some miracle of the Gods he did not, and you went to visit him as he lie in bed. You were told he would never walk again, and you knew that your climbing days were over. You didn&rsquo;t mind. All you wanted was to spend time with him, whatever way you could.</p><p>The visits to the Starks became less frequent after Ned left for King&rsquo;s Landing. After his execution, your father raced to Winterfell to help Robb and his army in any way that he could. You got to accompany him, but after Theon returned to take Winterfell you were whisked away to the Riverlands. You were informed of Bran and Rickard&rsquo;s passing weeks later, falling into a deep lull for many months.</p><p>As Sansa and the other Starks returned to Winterfell years later, you returned as well. You reunited with Bran, feeling something special spark as your eyes landed on him for the first time in years. It was more than just seeing an old friend. In fact, it was even more than just seeing your best childhood friend who you had believed was dead for years It was as if you were seeing your soulmate.</p><p>Now looking back on that memory, the way you felt, you realized that it may have been one-sided. You knew that he did not desire as he had before disappearing behind the wall, but you thought that you were different. You thought that he had loved you. Maybe instead he was able to read you like a book, realizing that you would be the easiest to have by his side because you would be there out of devotion instead of greed. Perhaps you were merely the most convenient.</p><p>Tears made their way from your eyes and down your cheeks as you finally reached the door, closing it behind you. To your surprise, Bran was already inside. You must have wandered the castle halls for longer than you thought. He turned his chair from where he had been sitting at the window so that he could face you.</p><p>&ldquo;What is wrong, my dear?&rdquo; He asked, using his arms to wheel his way over to you. Despite your obvious unhappiness, you did not want to admit to him your weakness.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, Bran,&rsquo; you replied. He cocked his head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You never call me that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well it is your name.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You began to get ready for bed, feeling Bran&rsquo;s eyes on you as you did so.</p><p>&ldquo;My love, I cannot help you unless you tell me what is wrong.&rdquo; He said. You could hear the pain in his voice.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;As if you couldn&rsquo;t just read my mind,&rdquo; you retort hotly. Bran let out a sigh.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know that I promised never to do that to you, Y/N. You know that I love you and I respect your privacy. I would never use my greensight against you to see what has happened to make you so upset. I want you to tell me yourself if you decide to of your own accord.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You took a deep, shaky breath.</p><p>&ldquo;But do you?&rdquo; You asked. Bran furrowed his brows.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I what, Y/N?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You said you love me. Do you?&rdquo; The tears began again, leaving hot trails on your face. His face fell. He reached out to you, pulling you to him so that you sat sideways across his lap. He held you with one arm as he wiped the tears as they fell from your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do, my dear. You are so special to me. You are a light shining in my life every day and I am lucky to be able to call you my own. What would make you think that I may feel any other way about you?&rdquo; Bran stared into your eyes and you knew he was telling the truth. His eyes were full of love and devotion, and you knew it. You leaned against his chest.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Three-Eyed-Raven,&rdquo; you say.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Does that make me any less your fiance as well?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, but it means that you do not have wants as normal people do.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Realizing what you thought, Bran pulling you into a tight hug, caressing your hair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right Y/N, I do not desire things as I did before I was pushed from that tower. But that does not mean that I do not desire you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You pulled back from him, looking into his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I may not want land, or wealth, or power, and I may not desire in the same way. But you, my darling,&rdquo; said Bran, looking at you with admiration,&nbsp;&ldquo;are my exception. I want you more than anyone could ever want anything. The first time I saw you again after the start of the war I felt something change in me. You sparked desire that I thought I could never feel. I have full faith that fate brought us together, whether because I am the Three-Eyed-Raven or in spite of that. I do love you Y/N, with all of my heart.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You crashed your lips to Bran&rsquo;s, his moving in sync with yours as you moved your body to straddle him instead of sitting sideways.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Bran,&rdquo; you said between kisses as you pulled back for air. He wheeled the two of you towards the bed that you shared, making you squeal and wrap your arms around his neck so that you wouldn&rsquo;t fall.</p><p>&ldquo;Come love, let&rsquo;s get into bed so that I may lay with the woman I love. My fiancee.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bran, that was rather cheesy. Especially for you.&rdquo; He smiled up at you as you helped him into bed, sliding in beside him and letting his arms wrap around you.</p><p>&ldquo;But you loved it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My love, if you don&rsquo;t hush up I won&rsquo;t help you get up in the morning and you&rsquo;ll be stuck here all day.&rdquo; You retort with a blush.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cruel woman,&rdquo; he teased.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I love you anyway.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You turned to face him and see his smiling face. You snuggled closer to his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;And I love you too, my dear.&rdquo;<br /></p>",
