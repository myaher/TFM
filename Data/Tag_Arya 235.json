The female characters on the show have been liberally white-washed as well in their transition from books to show. Consider:</p><p><b>Sansa Stark: </b>Her defining act in book one is the betrayal of her family to Cersei. her tattling to Cersei all of Ned\u2019s plans leads to Arya, Jeyne and Sansa herself not being on a ship to WF as Ned intended. Instead Jeyne gets stuck with LF, Arya has to go on the run and Sansa herself is stuck in KL. Ned confesses to save Sansa\u2019s life and ends up losing his head. GRRM has said that Sansa is partially responsible for Ned\u2019s death. And yet on the show, Sansa does not tattle to Cersei, the show blames Ned for everything that happened in KL with Sansa calling him stupid and Arya has no real issues with Sansa and has to fight with her over a letter. Even in the Vale, Sansa has no issues giving SweetRobin dangerously high levels of SweetSleep because LF knows best. Even on the show D&amp;D never fully commit to Sansa\u2019s arc of choosing between power and family, often framing scenes as Jon and Arya being in the wrong while Sansa is right to go against them. D&amp;D have admitted that they don\u2019t like it when Sansa gets hate from an audience and Bryan Cogman\u2019s hyper-defensiveness of the character is an indication of why the writing for Sansa is so bad on the show. <br/></p><p><b>Catelyn Stark:</b> Catelyn in the books really dislikes Jon Snow. And that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s a flaw in this very well written unique strong female character in the books. But the one thing that really made book readers dislike her was this bit:</p><p>\u201cIt should have been you\u201d</p><p>Catelyn wishing that it was Jon who was dying instead of Bran. Cruel and vicious. Catelyn calling Jon by his name for the first time - only to tell him that she wished he was the one dying. Jon feeling scared and nervous about entering the room when Cat was there. Jon hiding his sadness from Robb etc. Cat embraced her dislike of Jon and while she sometimes felt slightly guilty about it (Like when she met Mya), she never shied away from it. The show on the other hand, removed this whole part and added a whole scene about Cat feeling sad because she could not love Jon as a son. <br/></p><p><b>Cersei Lannister:</b> Cersei of one of those rare characters who is actually much well written on the show compared to the books. She\u2019s not one dimensionally evil like the book version and Lena Headey adds weight to the character with her wonderful acting. While GRRM throws Cersei\u2019s character under the bus for Jaime\u2019s redemption arc, the show does the opposite and develops Cersei at Jaime\u2019s expense. In the books, it\u2019s Cersei who kills all of Robert\u2019s bastard babies. On the show it\u2019s Joffrey. <br/></p><p><b>Daenerys Targaryen: </b>With respect to Arya and Dany, D&amp;D\u2019s take on them reduces them to merciless, bad-ass killers stripping them of their complexities, guilt, remorse, self-doubt, and regret which in the books makes us understand why these characters do the things they do. While the show has added in some shitty scenes (Dany roasting the slavers), they have also removed some parts that are often used to critique Dany\u2019s rule in slaver\u2019s bay. These include:</p><p>- her impulsive decision to have the wineseller\u2019s daughters interrogated by the shavepate when her beloved unsullied are ambushed and murdered. Dany does regret this later, but this is one of her unpopular actions. <br/></p><p>- the collective punishment she hands out in which innocent people including children may have died. <br/></p><p>- I also like that on the show Dany executes Mossador for murder while in the books, she hesitates to punish her men for the crimes they commit against the former slavers. <br/></p><p><b>Arya Stark: </b>Arya is such a beautifully written character in the books - a fun loving child who becomes a traumatized child soldier after her harrowing trip through Westeros and ending up in Braavos. D&amp;D reading her as just a bad-ass ninja going from one fun adventure to another clearly shows in how they write her as a revenge obsessed psychopath who is only good at killing. <br/></p><p>In the books, Arya does end up killing the insurance man. She mulls over it for an entire chapter trying to convince herself that this was the right thing to do - but she feels guilt and feels like she has no other choice. But she does do it. On the show, Arya is sidetracked by Meryn Trant and kills him instead. And then the FM gives her Lady Crane and she decides to not do it and leaves the FM. <br/></p><p>So, I would say that all the characters on the show have been whitewashed and not just the male characters. Some of Jon\u2019s morally complex decisions have been removed on the show - but that\u2019s not surprising considering his entire arc in ADwD was removed in favor of highlighting how Sansa is now a political mastermind and bad-ass who takes down Ramsay. <br/></p><p>In my opinion, Tyrion is the most white-washed character on the show. That\u2019s why I find it rather hilarious when he criticizes Dany - this is the guy who burned people to death using wildfire, the guy who rapes a slave out of bitterness - he is now the moral beacon of the show? GRRM is probably laughing right now at that thought!! <br/></p>",

Like the peculiar knight of the laughing tree,\nhis whereabout must be kept secret. Lyanna is the laughing tree to Gendry\u2019s\nbull: they\u2019re both their armors. Arya herself is a hidden princess, and a reluctantly\nbetrothed one at that (poor, poor Elmar Frey\u2026), garbed in ill-fitting gears:\nshe lost her Needle and the sword Gendry stole for her is simply too big for\nArya\u2019s size, mirroring Lyanna\u2019s mismatched, patched up armor at Harrenhal. </p><p>Through the first Arya POV chapters\nof ASOS, we\u2019re introduced to Tom Sevenstrings, who gets all the girls from the Riverland\nwith his harp, and Harwin, who compares Arya to Lyanna when the former attempts\nto flee on horseback: </p><p><i>Both\nhorses were lathered and flagging by the time he came up beside her, reached\nover, and grabbed her bridle. Arya was breathing hard herself then. She knew\nthe fight was done. <b>&ldquo;You ride like\na northman, milady,&rdquo; Harwin said when he&rsquo;d drawn them to a halt.\n&ldquo;Your aunt was the same. Lady Lyanna.</b> But my father was master of\nhorse, remember.&rdquo;</i>\n\u2013 Arya, ASOS</p><p>But the juicy parts happen at lady\nSmallwood\u2019s keep, when Arya is shoved into a green acorn dress and brown\nsocking \u2013 she\u2019s, quite literally, turned into a tree (Gendry even calls her a \u201cnice\noak tree\u201d, how romantic, huh?), which M.
