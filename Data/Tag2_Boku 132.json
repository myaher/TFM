You believed it always best to be trained in every combat style and technique in case of emergency. You never knew what situation you would end up finding yourself in, so you wanted to be as prepared as you could be. Most of your classmates knew this and often feed your hunger, especially if they wanted a good fight. However, there were some who wanted to see your skill level, which is what you guessed Todoroki wanted when he asked you to spar him after class. </p><p>It was where you found your current situation, hand to hand combat training without the use of quirks. It was raw and unforgiving, but Todoroki was pretty good at it. You had seen him when he practiced alone or would train with others in your class, leading to you concluding that he almost rivaled your abilities of close hand to hand combat. He didn\u2019t know how well you actually were. </p><p>He stood across from you, everything up until now being a little bit of stretching and you trying to make jokes that just didn\u2019t land. However, he was completely ready to put his all into this training. You still had no idea why he had asked you of all people to train with you. Maybe someone told him to train with you as a joke and he took it seriously, but you didn\u2019t want to think that someone did that to him. </p><p>But now it was time to start taking things a little more seriously. Without much of a clear \u201cgo\u201d, you ran at him, watching his body take a defensive position. His arm reached out at you, hand balled into a fist, but you were quick to dodge, moving to the side and ducking low. Your foot swiped his feet from under him, too fast for him to properly process what was happening. His body hit the ground and you quickly reached for his wrists, pinning them to the ground. </p><p>You chuckled, seeing the nearly blank expression on his face. You could tell from his bicolored eyes that he was thinking, and you thought that it was because he was caught off guard. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m pretty fast.\u201d But he should already know that, given your enhanced speed quirk. </p><p>He was looking into your eyes, face mere inches away from his. You didn\u2019t notice this until- \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 really close right now.\u201d </p><p>You blinked at him, once. Twice. By the third time, a blush had dusted over your cheeks. You withheld the scream of embarrassment you wanted to let out, hands loosening their grip on him. </p><p>Jumping right up, you laughed in an attempt to brush away the awkward. However, with the way he was looking at you, it couldn\u2019t be brushed away so easily. What did it matter if you were kind of really close to Todoroki? It was combat practice, of course you were going to get close to him! How else were you supposed to take him down? But why did he have to say something about it? </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d you squeaked out, looking at him. It was hard to look at him now, though, so you averted your eyes to look at anything but him. This training session had just become a lot harder to deal with and you didn\u2019t know if you should continue or not. </p><p>As you went to stand up, you were pinned down by your opponent. Groaning, you questioned his actions. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t we still sparring?\u201d he asked in return. </p><p>You looked up at him. Now he was the one that was really close to you. You blushed again, staring up into his different colored eyes, the ones that you thought were really cute. You didn\u2019t share that thought with anyone though, knowing what most people would think. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you mumbled, unable to take your eyes off of him now. How did he have this kind of power over you? One minute you can&rsquo;t look at him and the next you&rsquo;re practically devouring him with your eyes. </p><p>If the circumstances were different, the two of you might of kissed by now, but this wasn\u2019t some action movie with a romantic subplot. This was real life and whether you liked it or not, Todoroki Shoto probably wasn\u2019t going to kiss you while pinning you to the ground. </p><p>As if by magnetic force, you felt yourself pushing your body up. Your face closer to his, closing the space in between, and your lips meeting briefly. Your eyes closed, too frightened to see his reaction, but bygolly if he wouldn\u2019t kiss you than you just needed to take the matter into your own hands! You couldn\u2019t do much with your hands pinned above your head, and now that you lay under him like this, there was no escaping what you had just done. </p><p>Pulling away slowly, you laid your head against the ground. Your didn\u2019t open your eyes, not wanting to see the look of disgust or shame on his face. He was silent, unmoving, and you thought that perhaps you had indeed screwed up. You knew better! You shouldn\u2019t have done that! Now he\u2019ll probably never speak to you again! On top of it, he\u2019ll probably go back and tell everyone what you did and about hot this was the worst experience ever! You were going to become a laughing stock! You would probably have to-</p><p>You mind blanked when you felt the sensation of being kissed make its way over your lips again. Your eyes shot open, meeting the soft face of Todoroki. With his eyes closed, he was kissing you! You couldn&rsquo;t believe it, heart rate accelerating! This was unbelievable, but you found your eyes fluttering shut again. </p><p>To say the least, close hand training was now your favorite kind of training. </p>",

You believed it always best to be trained in every combat style and technique in case of emergency. You never knew what situation you would end up finding yourself in, so you wanted to be as prepared as you could be. Most of your classmates knew this and often feed your hunger, especially if they wanted a good fight. However, there were some who wanted to see your skill level, which is what you guessed Todoroki wanted when he asked you to spar him after class. </p><p>It was where you found your current situation, hand to hand combat training without the use of quirks. It was raw and unforgiving, but Todoroki was pretty good at it. You had seen him when he practiced alone or would train with others in your class, leading to you concluding that he almost rivaled your abilities of close hand to hand combat. He didn\u2019t know how well you actually were. </p><p>He stood across from you, everything up until now being a little bit of stretching and you trying to make jokes that just didn\u2019t land. However, he was completely ready to put his all into this training. You still had no idea why he had asked you of all people to train with you. Maybe someone told him to train with you as a joke and he took it seriously, but you didn\u2019t want to think that someone did that to him. </p><p>But now it was time to start taking things a little more seriously. Without much of a clear \u201cgo\u201d, you ran at him, watching his body take a defensive position. His arm reached out at you, hand balled into a fist, but you were quick to dodge, moving to the side and ducking low. Your foot swiped his feet from under him, too fast for him to properly process what was happening. His body hit the ground and you quickly reached for his wrists, pinning them to the ground. </p><p>You chuckled, seeing the nearly blank expression on his face. You could tell from his bicolored eyes that he was thinking, and you thought that it was because he was caught off guard. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m pretty fast.\u201d But he should already know that, given your enhanced speed quirk. </p><p>He was looking into your eyes, face mere inches away from his. You didn\u2019t notice this until- \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 really close right now.\u201d </p><p>You blinked at him, once. Twice. By the third time, a blush had dusted over your cheeks. You withheld the scream of embarrassment you wanted to let out, hands loosening their grip on him. </p><p>Jumping right up, you laughed in an attempt to brush away the awkward. However, with the way he was looking at you, it couldn\u2019t be brushed away so easily. What did it matter if you were kind of really close to Todoroki? It was combat practice, of course you were going to get close to him! How else were you supposed to take him down? But why did he have to say something about it? </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d you squeaked out, looking at him. It was hard to look at him now, though, so you averted your eyes to look at anything but him. This training session had just become a lot harder to deal with and you didn\u2019t know if you should continue or not. </p><p>As you went to stand up, you were pinned down by your opponent. Groaning, you questioned his actions. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t we still sparring?\u201d he asked in return. </p><p>You looked up at him. Now he was the one that was really close to you. You blushed again, staring up into his different colored eyes, the ones that you thought were really cute. You didn\u2019t share that thought with anyone though, knowing what most people would think. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you mumbled, unable to take your eyes off of him now. How did he have this kind of power over you? One minute you can\u2019t look at him and the next you\u2019re practically devouring him with your eyes. </p><p>If the circumstances were different, the two of you might of kissed by now, but this wasn\u2019t some action movie with a romantic subplot. This was real life and whether you liked it or not, Todoroki Shoto probably wasn\u2019t going to kiss you while pinning you to the ground. </p><p>As if by magnetic force, you felt yourself pushing your body up. Your face closer to his, closing the space in between, and your lips meeting briefly. Your eyes closed, too frightened to see his reaction, but bygolly if he wouldn\u2019t kiss you than you just needed to take the matter into your own hands! You couldn\u2019t do much with your hands pinned above your head, and now that you lay under him like this, there was no escaping what you had just done. </p><p>Pulling away slowly, you laid your head against the ground. Your didn\u2019t open your eyes, not wanting to see the look of disgust or shame on his face. He was silent, unmoving, and you thought that perhaps you had indeed screwed up. You knew better! You shouldn\u2019t have done that! Now he\u2019ll probably never speak to you again! On top of it, he\u2019ll probably go back and tell everyone what you did and about hot this was the worst experience ever! You were going to become a laughing stock! You would probably have to-</p><p>You mind blanked when you felt the sensation of being kissed make its way over your lips again. Your eyes shot open, meeting the soft face of Todoroki. With his eyes closed, he was kissing you! You couldn\u2019t believe it, heart rate accelerating! This was unbelievable, but you found your eyes fluttering shut again. </p><p>To say the least, close hand training was now your favorite kind of training. </p>",
