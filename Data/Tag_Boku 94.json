It felt nice against his palm, heat soaking into his flesh making him aware of just how cold the rest of him was.

It was too early to have a random redhead shouting and staring as if he was about to be murdered in the streets. Which, he\u2019d admit, didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea if this guy kept up the way he was staring.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bakugo grumbled at the stranger, though gave no time for a response as he turned his back on the redhead to set to work. He had enough to do this morning without being bothered by a random guy out for a walk at an ungodly hour.</p><p>Placing his mug on a side table, his hand reached for the various bins of flowers. Lavenders, daisies, Russian sage. They require lots of sun. With the shop sitting on the corner, he\u2019ll put them near the front door. It gets more light over there.</p><p>Pulling the bin of lavender into his arms, he turned to do just that. But there was something annoyingly in his way. Something with that stupid red hair that he assumed had gotten the message to keep moving along. This time he didn\u2019t give a verbal acknowledgement, instead giving a small grunt drawn home with a glare before continuing in his work. If the idiot wanted to gawk at nothing, then fine. As long as he didn\u2019t get in Bakugo\u2019s way, he could care less.</p><p>He\u2019ll put the Shasta daisies next to the lavender. And he\u2019ll put the stonecrop on a step stool or box\u2026 no, that wooden crate he found the other day at that thrift store. Then maybe he\u2019d pull that rustic watering can out and arrange the lavender and Russian sage in the top of it. That\u2019d be a nice sight when entering the shop. Maybe he\u2019d look into some of those hanging potted plants to put above the front door and along the top of the rolling garage door. Get rid of the sterility of the metal and replace it with\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis is a flower shop?\u201d</p><p>Bakugo hands stopped in their arrangement of begonias, surprised by the question considering the only inventory within sight were plants and flowers. His gaze rose to meet matching crimson eyes, though the ones that stared back at him held a curiosity that confused the blond. What was this guy still hanging around for?</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he responded, though his voice did not hold the same bite as before. Now taking another look at the stranger, he noticed more than just his obnoxious red hair. He took note of the various piercings lining his ears, including one that dangled from his middle ear to just below his earlobe. There was also the lip and nose ring. Both thin and black in color and hugging the flesh they surrounded. There was also the peek of ink that stretched just beyond the low collar of his shirt. Just enough to make Bakugo curious to what was printed there. Just enough to be annoying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d the redhead commented, a smile pulling at his lips, \u201cit\u2019ll be a much better sight than an abandoned sex shop.\u201d</p><p>Bakugo grimaced at the mention. He had bought the place as is, which meant he had to deal with the clean up of said sex shop. It was not something he wished to relive. Nor did he ever desire to step foot into one of those places ever again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kirishima Eijiro, by the way,\u201d he greeted brightly, his hand extending out to reveal black covered fingers. Bakugo raised his brow at them before the offer was retracted. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s charcoal. Sometimes I get in such a hurry, I don\u2019t wash it all off properly,\u201d he held a sheepish smile on his features before shoving his hands deep into the pockets of his tattered jean jacket.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Kirishima continued before Bakugo could take the chance to respond, \u201cbest be gettin\u2019 to work. I gotta client showing up bright and early. I\u2019ll see you around\u2026\u201d</p><p>He paused, which Bakugo hadn\u2019t expected. He had been talking the whole time, he wondered if what they were really having was a conversation. So, with another moment and a shift of begonias in his arms, he answered, \u201cBakugo Katsuki.\u201d</p><p>A smile beamed across Kirishima\u2019s features then, his charcoal covered hand raising again to give a small wave before turning to quickly cross the street for the tattoo shop. Somehow Bakugo wasn\u2019t surprised by the job placement, though he hadn\u2019t expected to meet his neighbor so soon. Nor could he ever anticipated how well.<br/></p>",
