You right, there have been some bad\nTargaryen rulers and the occasional wars that cropped up within the 300 years\nof their rule. However, there have been just as many\ngood Targaryen kings as there have been bad ones. The fact that the Targaryens\nhave held power over the Seven Kingdoms for so long goes to show how truly\npowerful and influential they were; even after the disappearance of dragons\nthey continue to rule for another century or so. While Robert Baratheon could\nbarely keep the realm together after the end of his rebellion; which became\nmore apparent after his death since the Lannisters quickly swept in to take the\nIron Throne, and the War of the Five Kings immediately followed.</p><p>If anything, the story GRRM is writing isn\u2019t Anti-Targaryen,\ninstead it\u2019s more an\u00a0<i>anti-war</i>\u00a0narrative.\nThat\u2019s why he shows how the petty disputes between the great houses negatively\naffect the economy of Westeros and sometimes focus on the suffering of the\ncommon-folk, as all these trivial battles will eventually make it harder for\nour heroes to come together to fight against the\u00a0<b>true</b>\u00a0<b>enemy\u00a0</b>beyond the wall. George is trying to build a\ngrey world with grey characters, so this idea that Targs are the only house who\nshouldn\u2019t rule over the Seven Kingdoms, is inherently wrong. Just as there are\nsome good and bad Targs; there are some good and bad Lannisters, Baratheons,\nTullys, Martells, and even the Starks are not completely without fault.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<b><i>Jaehaerys I made some good changes to Westeros but literally sulked for a year because he couldn\u2019t marry his sister. Alysanne was good but very much overhyped. </i></b>\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>And I also find it\nvery amusing that you criticize Jaehaerys and Alysanne as being \u201coverhyped\u201d,\nbut the majority of the J0nsa fandom seemed to be the proponent in comparing\nthem to Jon and Sansa respectively. They insistently made metas and theories\nrevolving around Sansa being Good Queen Alysanne come again, and Jon is the\nWise King who will rule by her side.\u00a0\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nThe smallfolk dont care (ie. that quote from Arya\u2019s chapter when someone says \u2018good king aerys\u2019) you might say, but that\u2019s because they are uneducated.\n\n\nTime and time again GRRM shows how messed up the Targaryens are. Marrying your relative is disgusting, messy, and it shows in all the mad Targaryens.\u00a0\u00a0\n</i></b><br/></p></blockquote><p>Also, maybe\u2026just maybe, the guy who praised Mad King Aerys for\nbeing a \u201cgood king\u201d might have actually believed he was a decent ruler from his\nown perspective. Just like how many people seen Tywin Lannister as a \u201chero\u201d\nduring/after Robert\u2019s Rebellion, even though\u00a0<b>he allowed one of his knights\nto rape and kill Elia Martell and the murder of her two innocent children</b>. After all, history is usually written by the winners, hardly is it ever written by the losers. Also, while on the topic of Tywin, you\nmentioned that marrying your relative is disgusting and messy, but seemed to\nomit J0nsa from that observation. A good comparison is Tywin\u2019s and Johanna\u2019s\nrelationship, as they were cousins who married and produced three children. You\nseem to think that centuries of Targ brother-sister incest was what led to\ntheir madness, but\u00a0<i>\u201cMad Queen\u201d Cersei was a direct product of cousin-cousin incest</i>\u00a0and her descent into madness seemed to be\na parallel to Mad King Aerys\u2019<i>.</i>\u00a0</p><p>Despite what anyone says, Jon and Sansa being in a romantic\nrelationship\u00a0<i>is still a form of incest</i>. Even if they do not share as much blood/dna as Jon would with\nDany, it\u00a0<b>doesn\u2019t change the fact that Sansa and Jon both call Ned Stark\n\u201cfather\u201d and refer to each other as sister/brother</b>. Not only do they biologically share a\ncertain amount of dna, but they were raised in a family environment together\namong other siblings; which makes this incestuous relationship even more\nbizarre than Jon and Dany (who are\u00a0<b>two strangers\u00a0</b>falling in love).\u00a0 \u00a0</p><blockquote><p><b><i>DAENERYS IS THE MAD QUEEN\u00a0What qualities make a good ruler? Kindness, patience, thoughtfulness, approachable, grateful, peaceful.\n\nUnfortunately for anyone who must suffer under her tyrannical rule, Dany is mad.\n\n</i></b></p></blockquote><p><b>2</b>.) I am sick of this Mad!Dany hullabaloo. I\nunderstand that burning someone alive is a very horrendous form of death; but\nthat didn\u2019t really stop\u00a0<b><i>Stannis</i></b><b>\u00a0</b>from\u00a0<b>burning people alive at the\nstakes</b>\u00a0when they didn\u2019t\nbend the knee to him, or forsake their religious beliefs. Nor do I hear people\ncall\u00a0<b><i>Tyrion\u00a0</i></b>\u201cmad\u201d for using\u00a0<i>really hot</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>uncontrollable</i>\u00a0<b>wildfire</b>\u00a0against Stannis\u2019s fleets during Battle\nof Blackwater Bay, which was easily set off by one single arrow. And people\nwere fine when\u00a0<b><i>Jon Snow</i></b><b>\u00a0used fire against the\nWildling</b>\u00a0invasion on the\nWall at Castle Black.</p><p>Several people in this\nseries had used fire in battles to win wars, as fire is a very effective weapon\nto use.\u00a0So it is mind-boggling when I hear and see these theories about\nDany going mad, mostly because she happens to favor the use of her dragons to\nwin battles. Though Dany have consistently shown how kind, patient, thoughtful,\napproachable, grateful, and peaceful she could and would be throughout the\nshow. It seem like a certain group of people rather focus on what they\nconstrued as bad/evil aspects in Daenerys, but also conveniently ignore the\ngood she had done.\u00a0</p><ul><li>Have you forgotten the\u00a0<b><i>kindness\u00a0</i></b>she\nhad shown when she claimed all the Lhazareen women to keep them from\nbeing\u00a0<i>raped</i>, or when she tried to give water to a crucified\nmale slave with her own hands?</li></ul><ul><li>Have you forgotten how\u00a0<b><i>patient\u00a0</i></b>she\nwas when she allowed Tyrion to make his case (aka tell a story) to her when he\nfirst came to Meereen, even though he was a Lannister and a son of the man who\nbetrayed her family?\u00a0</li></ul><ul><li>Have you forgotten how\u00a0<b><i>thoughtful\u00a0</i></b>she\nwas for deciding to chain her two dragons (her children), after\u00a0a young\ngirl was tragically burned to death by Drogon, in order\u00a0to keep this\nincident from happening again?\u00a0</li></ul><ul><li>Have you forgotten how\u00a0<b><i>approachable\u00a0</i></b>she\nwas for the many slaves who came to call her \u201cMhysa\u201d after she freed them from\nslavery, as she went down to meet them despite her advisors warnings against\ndoing so?\u00a0</li></ul><ul><li>Have you forgotten how\u00a0<b><i>grateful\u00a0</i></b>she\nwas for Jorah\u2019s friendship and continued loyalty, even though he had originally\nplanned on betraying her to Robert Baratheon and then hidden this fact from her\nyears after?\u00a0</li></ul><ul><li>Have you forgotten how much she was willing to achieve\u00a0<b><i>peace\u00a0</i></b>in Meereen, to the point she had reopen\nup the fighting pits and entered an arranged marriage with a man who she did\nnot love (and is most likely a hidden enemy) to stop the attacks from the\nSotH?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></li></ul><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nThink of all the people she has murdered, not even letting them die in a dignified way&hellip;.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/></i></b></p></blockquote><p>And forgive me if I do not feel much sympathy when Daenerys\ndecide to burn people like the\u00a0<b>slave masters</b>\u00a0who had owned living breathing humans as\nif they were cattle to be bought or sold. Or when she had burned the khals\nwithin the temple of the Dosh Khaleen, after\u00a0<b>they kidnapped her and\nthreatened to rape and abuse</b>\u00a0her as they pleased. Nor can I muster up much\nunderstanding for a certain need to victimize Randyll Tarly, as if this guy\ndidn\u2019t aligned himself with Cersei Lannister (of all people) and\u00a0<b>commit treason</b>\u00a0against his liege lady, Olenna Tyrell.\nAnd I\u2019m pretty sure Samwell Tarly wouldn\u2019t be so torn up about his father\u2019s\ndeath, as his father had regularly\u00a0<b>emotionally</b>\u00a0(and possibly physically)\u00a0<b>abused</b>\u00a0him, and even\u00a0<b>subtly threatening to kill him</b>\u00a0if he didn\u2019t become a member of the\nNight\u2019s Watch.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><b><i>WHY WOULD JON WANT HER?\u00a0You ask why Jon would want Sansa, well, why would he want Dany??</i></b></p></blockquote><p><b>3</b>.) I\u2019m pretty sure there are a lot of reasons\nwhy Jon would want to be with Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen; outside of\nher physical beauty, powerful army, and being a potential ally. Daenerys have\njust about everything Jon would need to have a chance of defeating the Night\nKing and his army, but she also has the characteristics that he would find most\nattractive:\u00a0<i>Lovely</i>,\u00a0<i>lethal</i>, and\u00a0<i>lonely</i>. Also, Dany isn\u2019t a typical courteous\nWesteros lady who sits patiently waiting in a tower needing to be rescued,\ninstead Dany is\u00a0<b><i>a fierce warrior queen who does the rescuing</i></b>.</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nHer father murdered his innocent grandfather and uncle, wanted to kill his father/uncle Ned, and (as far as he knows) her brother kidnapped his aunt/mother Lyanna. Let\u2019s be honest, it wasn\u2019t technically Dany\u2019s fault but still, it would be a sore point, I think.\n\n</i></b><br/></p></blockquote><p>I also do not see why Jon will hold the deaths of his\ngrandfather, uncle, and aunt (his mother) Lyanna against Daenerys; when the 1<sup>st</sup>\u00a0and 2<sup>nd</sup>\u00a0episode of GoT s7 already made it clear\nthat Jon Snow isn\u2019t the type to blame the sins of the father against the\nchildren. (Especially since Catelyn ended up blaming Ned\u2019s \u201csin\u201d onto Jon, even\nthough he had no control over Ned\u2019s choices and didn\u2019t even know who his mother\nwas.)</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nAlso, the Starks might be less forgiving of her father\u2019s burning their family when they discover Dany too is quite happy to burn people alive when it suits her.\n\n</i></b><br/></p></blockquote><p>And as I brought up in my first point, the Starks aren\u2019t saints\neither. You like to keep pointing out that Dany burns people alive, but ignore\nthe fact that Bran had on several occasions\u00a0<b>forcibly skinchanged into a\nmentally-disabled Hodor\u00a0</b>and\nused his body against his will. Arya have mercilessly killed several people in\ndisturbing ways and actually\u00a0<i>enjoyed</i>\u00a0committing some of those murders, such\nas her killing Walder Frey\u00a0<b>after letting him eat his sons\nthat were baked in a meat pie</b>. Even proper lady Sansa had found satisfaction in\u00a0<b>watching Ramsey Bolton getting\neaten alive by his own hunting dogs</b>.\u00a0And though I love Sansa Stark, I can\u2019t help but think\nthat she was fairly hypocritical for wanting to throw Alys Karstark and Ned\nUmber out of their ancestral homes because of their traitorous fathers\u2019\nwrongdoings; even though she had been abused in King\u2019s Landings at the hands of\nJoffery and Cersei, as she too was unjustly blamed for her father\u2019s and Robb\u2019s\n\u201ctraitorous\u201d actions.\u00a0</p><p>Once again, I hardly hear any of these characters getting the\nsame level of backlash Dany does when they commit these appalling acts, which\nmakes this argument seem very biased. If Jon is going to be horrified by Dany\nburning her\u00a0<i>enemies</i>\u00a0alive, then he\nshould be equally appalled by Stannis (who ended up burning his own daughter,\nShireen) and Melisandre, but we already know that Jon was willing to spare\nMelisandre life regardless of her heinous actions\u2026.\u00a0\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><b><i><b>SHE KEPT JON AS PRISONER</b>\n\n\nDany didn\u2019t let Jon leave Dragonstone when she knew he had to get back to Winterfell as soon as possible, even if she didn\u2019t believe him when it came to the Others&hellip;.Yet she keeps him there, delaying him further and further.\n\n</i>\n\n\n<br/></b></p></blockquote><p><b>4</b>.) I cannot deny that Jon Snow remarked that\nhe felt like a prisoner on Dragonstone in the beginning of his stay, I concede\nwith this point. However, this does not deny the fact that Daenerys treated him\nwith respect that most wouldn\u2019t be given if they were truly prisoners. Whereas,\nTyrion was once locked up in a sky cell which opened up to the steep drop off a\nmountain\u2019s cliff, and Jaime was held chained in a small filthy cage and\nconstantly facing threats to his life; Jon was instead given a chamber to sleep\nin and was honestly treated more like a guest. He never complained about not\ngetting food or water, he never seemed to truly fear for his life around Dany\u2019s\nmen (while\u00a0<i>without\u00a0</i>his\nsword), and\u00a0<b>he definitely didn\u2019t complain about getting free access to the\ncave filled with his sought-after dragonglass</b>.</p><p>The fact that Daenerys was\u00a0<i>willing</i>\u00a0to allow Jon to mine the dragonglass\n(that he obviously\u00a0<i>wanted</i>) which is on\u00a0<i>her land</i>, with some extra\u00a0<i>help</i>\u00a0of her Dothraki warriors\u00a0<i>without any form</i>\u00a0<i>of payment</i>\u00a0or favor, just reveals how generous Dany\ntruly is. Also, Daenerys seemed to have allowed Jon to roam Dragonstone without an\nescort, enough so that he was able to talk to Missandei (Dany\u2019s most trusted\nadvisor and friend) with only Davos as his semi-constant companion.</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nManipulating him, even. Until the only way he can get her help when his people will die is to fuck her.\n\n</i></b><br/></p></blockquote><p>And this spiel about Daenerys \u201cmanipulating\u201d Jon Snow needs to\nend, because she does not need to manipulate him. Dany could have easily taken\nthe North with her\u00a0<i>three grown dragons</i>, her army of\u00a0<i>trained</i>\u00a0<i>Unsullied</i>, and\u00a0<i>Dothraki horse-riders</i>\u00a0(i.e. Aegon the Conqueror come again )\nif she wanted to, just as she could have easily destroyed Cersei if she had\ngone through with burning the Red Keep,\u00a0<b>but she didn\u2019t</b>. Because Daenerys doesn\u2019t want to cause\nunneeded casualties when she can go the peaceful route,\u00a0<i>so that is why she demands Jon\nto bend the knee, but never truly forces him to do so</i>. And the J0nsa fandom is truly confusing me,\nwho is manipulating who; is Jon the political mastermind or is it Daenarys?</p><p>Honestly, if anyone\nwas manipulating someone, it was <i>Tyrion-Freaking-Lannister</i> who wrote and sent\nthe letter to Jon and have him come under false presumptions. (It was also\nTyrion who thought of the dumb Wight-hunt plan, which nearly caused Jon\u2019s\nsecond death. Dany was against it in the beginning, but conceded after Jon\nstated that he was a king and can make his own choices.) And the thought of Jon\nhaving to sexually manipulate any woman to get his way is very disgusting and\ntwisted.\u00a0I don\u2019t care how much you like or dislike Dany (or any character\nfor the matter), the idea that manipulating someone\u2019s feelings via sex is somehow\nacceptable because \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t help his people otherwise\u201d, is\nreprehensible.\u00a0</p><p>Like,\u00a0<i>really</i>? Go back and re-watch\nthe scene of Daenerys talking to a recovering bare-chested Jon and tell me that\nshe didn\u2019t\u00a0<b>just swear to fight for the North against the AotD,\u00a0<i>on her\nown free-will</i></b>. After all; she had\njust recently lost one of her\u00a0<i>children</i>, saw how many White Walkers were coming, and\nhad seen the threat of the Night King with her very own eyes.\u00a0<i>Why wouldn\u2019t she want to help\nJon Snow fight to save humanity after that?</i>\u00a0As I had pointed out before, Dany is too compassionate,\ntoo thoughtful, and too fearless to allow an undead army to come and destroy\nwhat she believe could be her home. And it is because of these attributes that\nJon decided to finally bend the knee and proclaimed her as \u201chis\nqueen\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Whew! I still have\neven more to say about why Jonerys is still a viable canon ship, but I just\nwanted to spend the time to try and give my opinion. Of course, my meta isn\u2019t\nas great as the ones @oadara or @instantbouquetface-me have written, but I\nthink I was able to express some of my thoughts clearly.</p>",

I\u2019m pretty sure there are a lot of reasons\nwhy Jon would want to be with Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen; outside of\nher physical beauty, powerful army, and being a potential ally. Daenerys have\njust about everything Jon would need to have a chance of defeating the Night\nKing and his army, but she also has the characteristics that he would find most\nattractive:\u00a0<i>Lovely</i>,\u00a0<i>lethal</i>, and\u00a0<i>lonely</i>. Also, Dany isn\u2019t a typical courteous\nWesteros lady who sits patiently waiting in a tower needing to be rescued,\ninstead Dany is\u00a0<b><i>a fierce warrior queen who does the rescuing</i></b>.</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nHer father murdered his innocent grandfather and uncle, wanted to kill his father/uncle Ned, and (as far as he knows) her brother kidnapped his aunt/mother Lyanna.

(Especially since Catelyn ended up blaming Ned\u2019s \u201csin\u201d onto Jon, even\nthough he had no control over Ned\u2019s choices and didn\u2019t even know who his mother\nwas.)</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nAlso, the Starks might be less forgiving of her father\u2019s burning their family when they discover Dany too is quite happy to burn people alive when it suits her.\n\n</i></b><br></p></blockquote><p>And as I brought up in my first point, the Starks aren\u2019t saints\neither. You like to keep pointing out that Dany burns people alive, but ignore\nthe fact that Bran had on several occasions\u00a0<b>forcibly skinchanged into a\nmentally-disabled Hodor\u00a0</b>and\nused his body against his will. Arya have mercilessly killed several people in\ndisturbing ways and actually\u00a0<i>enjoyed</i>\u00a0committing some of those murders, such\nas her killing Walder Frey\u00a0<b>after letting him eat his sons\nthat were baked in a meat pie</b>. Even proper lady Sansa had found satisfaction in\u00a0<b>watching Ramsey Bolton getting\neaten alive by his own hunting dogs</b>.\u00a0And though I love Sansa Stark, I can\u2019t help but think\nthat she was fairly hypocritical for wanting to throw Alys Karstark and Ned\nUmber out of their ancestral homes because of their traitorous fathers\u2019\nwrongdoings; even though she had been abused in King\u2019s Landings at the hands of\nJoffery and Cersei, as she too was unjustly blamed for her father\u2019s and Robb\u2019s\n\u201ctraitorous\u201d actions.\u00a0</p><p>Once again, I hardly hear any of these characters getting the\nsame level of backlash Dany does when they commit these appalling acts, which\nmakes this argument seem very biased. If Jon is going to be horrified by Dany\nburning her\u00a0<i>enemies</i>\u00a0alive, then he\nshould be equally appalled by Stannis (who ended up burning his own daughter,\nShireen) and Melisandre, but we already know that Jon was willing to spare\nMelisandre life regardless of her heinous actions\u2026.\u00a0\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><b><i><b>SHE KEPT JON AS PRISONER</b>\n\n\nDany didn\u2019t let Jon leave Dragonstone when she knew he had to get back to Winterfell as soon as possible, even if she didn\u2019t believe him when it came to the Others\u2026.Yet she keeps him there, delaying him further and further.\n\n</i>\n\n\n<br></b></p></blockquote><p><b>4</b>.) I cannot deny that Jon Snow remarked that\nhe felt like a prisoner on Dragonstone in the beginning of his stay, I concede\nwith this point. However, this does not deny the fact that Daenerys treated him\nwith respect that most wouldn\u2019t be given if they were truly prisoners. Whereas,\nTyrion was once locked up in a sky cell which opened up to the steep drop off a\nmountain\u2019s cliff, and Jaime was held chained in a small filthy cage and\nconstantly facing threats to his life; Jon was instead given a chamber to sleep\nin and was honestly treated more like a guest. He never complained about not\ngetting food or water, he never seemed to truly fear for his life around Dany\u2019s\nmen (while\u00a0<i>without\u00a0</i>his\nsword), and\u00a0<b>he definitely didn\u2019t complain about getting free access to the\ncave filled with his sought-after dragonglass</b>.</p><p>The fact that Daenerys was\u00a0<i>willing</i>\u00a0to allow Jon to mine the dragonglass\n(that he obviously\u00a0<i>wanted</i>) which is on\u00a0<i>her land</i>, with some extra\u00a0<i>help</i>\u00a0of her Dothraki warriors\u00a0<i>without any form</i>\u00a0<i>of payment</i>\u00a0or favor, just reveals how generous Dany\ntruly is. Also, Daenerys seemed to have allowed Jon to roam Dragonstone without an\nescort, enough so that he was able to talk to Missandei (Dany\u2019s most trusted\nadvisor and friend) with only Davos as his semi-constant companion.</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nManipulating him, even. Until the only way he can get her help when his people will die is to fuck her.\n\n</i></b><br></p></blockquote><p>And this spiel about Daenerys \u201cmanipulating\u201d Jon Snow needs to\nend, because she does not need to manipulate him. Dany could have easily taken\nthe North with her\u00a0<i>three grown dragons</i>, her army of\u00a0<i>trained</i>\u00a0<i>Unsullied</i>, and\u00a0<i>Dothraki horse-riders</i>\u00a0(i.e. Aegon the Conqueror come again )\nif she wanted to, just as she could have easily destroyed Cersei if she had\ngone through with burning the Red Keep,\u00a0<b>but she didn\u2019t</b>. Because Daenerys doesn\u2019t want to cause\nunneeded casualties when she can go the peaceful route,\u00a0<i>so that is why she demands Jon\nto bend the knee, but never truly forces him to do so</i>. And the J0nsa fandom is truly confusing me,\nwho is manipulating who; is Jon the political mastermind or is it Daenarys?</p><p>Honestly, if anyone\nwas manipulating someone, it was <i>Tyrion-Freaking-Lannister</i> who wrote and sent\nthe letter to Jon and have him come under false presumptions. (It was also\nTyrion who thought of the dumb Wight-hunt plan, which nearly caused Jon\u2019s\nsecond death. Dany was against it in the beginning, but conceded after Jon\nstated that he was a king and can make his own choices.) And the thought of Jon\nhaving to sexually manipulate any woman to get his way is very disgusting and\ntwisted.\u00a0I don\u2019t care how much you like or dislike Dany (or any character\nfor the matter), the idea that manipulating someone\u2019s feelings via sex is somehow\nacceptable because \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t help his people otherwise\u201d, is\nreprehensible.\u00a0</p><p>Like,\u00a0<i>really</i>? Go back and re-watch\nthe scene of Daenerys talking to a recovering bare-chested Jon and tell me that\nshe didn\u2019t\u00a0<b>just swear to fight for the North against the AotD,\u00a0<i>on her\nown free-will</i></b>. After all; she had\njust recently lost one of her\u00a0<i>children</i>, saw how many White Walkers were coming, and\nhad seen the threat of the Night King with her very own eyes.\u00a0<i>Why wouldn\u2019t she want to help\nJon Snow fight to save humanity after that?</i>\u00a0As I had pointed out before, Dany is too compassionate,\ntoo thoughtful, and too fearless to allow an undead army to come and destroy\nwhat she believe could be her home. And it is because of these attributes that\nJon decided to finally bend the knee and proclaimed her as \u201chis\nqueen\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Whew! I still have\neven more to say about why Jonerys is still a viable canon ship, but I just\nwanted to spend the time to try and give my opinion. Of course, my meta isn\u2019t\nas great as the ones @oadara or @instantbouquetface-me have written, but I\nthink I was able to express some of my thoughts clearly.</p>",

Whereas,\nTyrion was once locked up in a sky cell which opened up to the steep drop off a\nmountain\u2019s cliff, and Jaime was held chained in a small filthy cage and\nconstantly facing threats to his life; Jon was instead given a chamber to sleep\nin and was honestly treated more like a guest.

Dany was against it in the beginning, but conceded after Jon\nstated that he was a king and can make his own choices.) And the thought of Jon\nhaving to sexually manipulate any woman to get his way is very disgusting and\ntwisted.\u00a0I don\u2019t care how much you like or dislike Dany (or any character\nfor the matter), the idea that manipulating someone\u2019s feelings via sex is somehow\nacceptable because \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t help his people otherwise\u201d, is\nreprehensible.\u00a0</p><p>Like,\u00a0<i>really</i>?

Also be aware that I am mostly using\nshow canon and bits of book info I picked up from other meta/theory\nwriters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><b><i><b>THE STORY IS ANTI-TARGARYEN</b>\n\nJonerys shippers talk about the Targaryen dynasty like Dany does as if it was ~300 years of absolute peace and prosperity, which is just wrong.\n\n</i></b></p></blockquote><p><b>1</b>.) You right, there have been some bad\nTargaryen rulers and the occasional wars that cropped up within the 300 years\nof their rule. However, there have been just as many\ngood Targaryen kings as there have been bad ones. The fact that the Targaryens\nhave held power over the Seven Kingdoms for so long goes to show how truly\npowerful and influential they were; even after the disappearance of dragons\nthey continue to rule for another century or so. While Robert Baratheon could\nbarely keep the realm together after the end of his rebellion; which became\nmore apparent after his death since the Lannisters quickly swept in to take the\nIron Throne, and the War of the Five Kings immediately followed.</p><p>If anything, the story GRRM is writing isn&rsquo;t Anti-Targaryen,\ninstead it&rsquo;s more an&nbsp;<i>anti-war</i>&nbsp;narrative.\nThat&rsquo;s why he shows how the petty disputes between the great houses negatively\naffect the economy of Westeros and sometimes focus on the suffering of the\ncommon-folk, as all these trivial battles will eventually make it harder for\nour heroes to come together to fight against the&nbsp;<b>true</b>&nbsp;<b>enemy&nbsp;</b>beyond the wall. George is trying to build a\ngrey world with grey characters, so this idea that Targs are the only house who\nshouldn&rsquo;t rule over the Seven Kingdoms, is inherently wrong. Just as there are\nsome good and bad Targs; there are some good and bad Lannisters, Baratheons,\nTullys, Martells, and even the Starks are not completely without fault.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<b><i>Jaehaerys I made some good changes to Westeros but literally sulked for a year because he couldn&rsquo;t marry his sister. Alysanne was good but very much overhyped. </i></b>\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>And I also find it\nvery amusing that you criticize Jaehaerys and Alysanne as being &ldquo;overhyped&rdquo;,\nbut the majority of the J0nsa fandom seemed to be the proponent in comparing\nthem to Jon and Sansa respectively. They insistently made metas and theories\nrevolving around Sansa being Good Queen Alysanne come again, and Jon is the\nWise King who will rule by her side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\n\nThe smallfolk dont care (ie. that quote from Arya&rsquo;s chapter when someone says &lsquo;good king aerys&rsquo;) you might say, but that&rsquo;s because they are uneducated.\n\n\nTime and time again GRRM shows how messed up the Targaryens are. Marrying your relative is disgusting, messy, and it shows in all the mad Targaryens.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</i></b><br /></p></blockquote><p>Also, maybe&hellip;just maybe, the guy who praised Mad King Aerys for\nbeing a &ldquo;good king&rdquo; might have actually believed he was a decent ruler from his\nown perspective. Just like how many people seen Tywin Lannister as a &ldquo;hero&rdquo;\nduring/after Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, even though&nbsp;<b>he allowed one of his knights\nto rape and kill Elia Martell and the murder of her two innocent children</b>. After all, history is usually written by the winners, hardly is it ever written by the losers. Also, while on the topic of Tywin, you\nmentioned that marrying your relative is disgusting and messy, but seemed to\nomit J0nsa from that observation. A good comparison is Tywin&rsquo;s and Johanna&rsquo;s\nrelationship, as they were cousins who married and produced three children. You\nseem to think that centuries of Targ brother-sister incest was what led to\ntheir madness, but&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Mad Queen&rdquo; Cersei was a direct product of cousin-cousin incest</i>&nbsp;and her descent into madness seemed to be\na parallel to Mad King Aerys&rsquo;<i>.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite what anyone says, Jon and Sansa being in a romantic\nrelationship&nbsp;<i>is still a form of incest</i>. Even if they do not share as much blood/dna as Jon would with\nDany, it&nbsp;<b>doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Sansa and Jon both call Ned Stark\n&ldquo;father&rdquo; and refer to each other as sister/brother</b>. Not only do they biologically share a\ncertain amount of dna, but they were raised in a family environment together\namong other siblings; which makes this incestuous relationship even more\nbizarre than Jon and Dany (who are&nbsp;<b>two strangers&nbsp;</b>falling in love).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><b><i>DAENERYS IS THE MAD QUEEN&nbsp;What qualities make a good ruler? Kindness, patience, thoughtfulness, approachable, grateful, peaceful.\n\nUnfortunately for anyone who must suffer under her tyrannical rule, Dany is mad.\n\n</i></b></p></blockquote><p><b>2</b>.)

(It was also\nTyrion who thought of the dumb Wight-hunt plan, which nearly caused Jon&rsquo;s\nsecond death. Dany was against it in the beginning, but conceded after Jon\nstated that he was a king and can make his own choices.) And the thought of Jon\nhaving to sexually manipulate any woman to get his way is very disgusting and\ntwisted.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t care how much you like or dislike Dany (or any character\nfor the matter), the idea that manipulating someone&rsquo;s feelings via sex is somehow\nacceptable because &ldquo;she wouldn&rsquo;t help his people otherwise&rdquo;, is\nreprehensible.&nbsp;</p><p>Like,&nbsp;<i>really</i>? Go back and re-watch\nthe scene of Daenerys talking to a recovering bare-chested Jon and tell me that\nshe didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<b>just swear to fight for the North against the AotD,&nbsp;<i>on her\nown free-will</i></b>. After all; she had\njust recently lost one of her&nbsp;<i>children</i>, saw how many White Walkers were coming, and\nhad seen the threat of the Night King with her very own eyes.&nbsp;<i>Why wouldn&rsquo;t she want to help\nJon Snow fight to save humanity after that?</i>&nbsp;As I had pointed out before, Dany is too compassionate,\ntoo thoughtful, and too fearless to allow an undead army to come and destroy\nwhat she believe could be her home. And it is because of these attributes that\nJon decided to finally bend the knee and proclaimed her as &ldquo;his\nqueen&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whew! I still have\neven more to say about why Jonerys is still a viable canon ship, but I just\nwanted to spend the time to try and give my opinion. Of course, my meta isn&rsquo;t\nas great as the ones @oadara or @instantbouquetface-me have written, but I\nthink I was able to express some of my thoughts clearly.</p>",
