Sick!Lily and Caring!James</b></p><p>Lily was fudging sick.</p><p>Will you believe it? The absolute hilarity of the situation baffles her. It&rsquo;s not enough that a <i>terrorist </i>is after her family and she\u2019s scared beyond her wits. Nope, now she was going to be treated like a liability because of her cold.</p><p>If she was at the Evans household, she would have been brushed off with a spoonful of medicine in her mouth and a warning to take care before she bounced about in the rain. Sadly, and for the first time, she wished she wasn\u2019t at the Potter\u2019s household but rather at the Evans.</p><p>How she longed for her sister\u2019s snarky remarks and her constant- and here, she casts a melancholic look at the fridge- unlimited access to ice cream.</p><p>It seemed like life was biting her in the ass. For here, she was safely tucked on the couch, a bunch of blankets surrounding her offering warmth and her wonderful crazy husband bustling around in the kitchen making her another cup of tea.</p><p>It\u2019d be her fifth glass, if her memory proved true.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s immediately at her side, weary lines etched on his forehead and hands gently holding hers.</p><p>Letting out an involuntary chuckle and immediately cringing as her throat stung with the vibration, she opened her eyes and took in James\u2019s worried face. \u201cI\u2019m fine, jeez. Can I have ice cream?\u201d</p><p>Her assurance doesn\u2019t seem to have affected him for he seems to get more frenzied by the second. \u201cYou just said can.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cSo?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to use may.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw drops open. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because of the terrible cold,\u201d James mumbles, his attention already drifting far away and most definitely not on Lily\u2019s need, her dire craving to have ice cream. She tugs at his hand and reminds him.</p><p>James lets out a chuckle and kisses her forehead. \u201cDefinitely not, sweetheart. You\u2019ll catch an even bigger cold.\u201d</p><p>Lily huffs and turns away, the residue of his laughter still ringing in her ears.</p><p>Hours past though it seems like days to Lily. James, occasionally touching her forehead and sighing is the only action and reality she\u2019s aware of in the haze of restless sleep. Sometimes, he\u2019ll murmur out an I love you and sometimes, he\u2019d tuck the blankets around her, maintaining the cozy atmosphere.</p><p>He woke her up to have tea and medicine and her body protests at the motion of sitting up but she manages to it with a pained smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want another-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, James.\u201d</p><p>He was like a mother hen, shuffling around her and fluffing her pillows over and over again.</p><p>After she drinks the tea, she lets her body sags and rests her head on her pillow. He\u2019d made the tea sweet and it\u2019s funny how the gesture makes her heart swell. Sometimes, James would joke and ask her whether the reasons she asked him out was because of their shared infatuation with sugar. In a way, it kind of was but that was a story to be told another time.</p><p>\u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>The lady in question hums in an answer.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She obeys and immediately lets out a shrill sound. Brown eyes- <i>very close brown eyes-</i> blink up at her. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to have your medicine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d She protests but her treacherous body decides to cough. Before her husband decides to say anything, she moves against the couch and pats the place next to her. \u201cCuddle.\u201d</p><p>Hesitation flickers in his doe-like eyes for a second before he consents. Happily, she snuggles into him, throwing the blanket over him and nuzzling his neck.</p><p>James flushes and nestles in her warmth, resting his arm around her waist. \u201cJust for a little while.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s really amazing that they still acted like teenagers when they were anything but. Five years into their marriage and one child in-or rather, out- and they still acted like the saps they were when they first started dating. A lot had changed since then. Lily had revised her branch of education and James had shrugged off the antics he pulled up in Hogwarts. In their small world, nothing had changed. They still burned with the same love and adoration they reserved only for the other.</p><p>And cocooned in the other\u2019s arms, they allowed the warmth seeping in to comfort their bones and the silence lulled them into a deep sleep.</p><p>She\u2019s awoken by a curse. Blinking in the haze, she suddenly feels the icy cold sting her chest as James untangles himself from her. She breaks out in a fit of coughs and pinches her forehead in pain.</p><p>\u201cGod, Lily.\u201d James murmurs, checking her temperature. \u201cHave your medicine.\u201d</p><p>And its really at the height of how much she hates being sick, how ridiculous and stubborn she is when she says: \u201cYou\u2019ll give me ice cream?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a sigh. \u201cFudge, yes. Okay? Just have the bloody medicine.\u201d</p><p>Petulantly, she does as she\u2019s told and she takes the pills, swallowing a cup of water soon after and hissing when it caresses her throat.</p><p>Shaking it off, she stares at James. \u201cIce cream.\u201d</p><p>In a single motion, he swoops down and kisses her, long and hard and she\u2019s thrown back by the sudden passion. Against her will, really, she sighs happily. \u201cThis is better than ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He immediately straightens and laughs. \u201cYeah? The James Flavor!\u201d</p><p>She flops down again and groans. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be the most famous flavor, right? Slogan being; Curing people since 18C. Wait, I wasn\u2019t born then but who knows, I might have. Wait, that\u2019s not the point. What is, really? How amazing I am? Padfoot is-\u201c</p><p>James breaks off as he catches sight of his wife snoring softly. Her mouth is silently open and a line of drool trails it. He finds it beyond endearing and wonders how he got so lucky.</p><p>\u201cDada?\u201d</p><p>The father turns and reflects the adoration in his gaze to his son. Putting a finger to his lip, he silently instructs Harry to keep silent. The boy nods wisely and pads over, stuffed toy in hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a nightmare.\u201d And young Harry rubs his hand over his eyes as if to add fact to his statement.</p><p>\u201cWanna sleep with mummy and me?\u201d</p><p>James doesn\u2019t wait for the nod.
