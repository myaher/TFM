        "body": "<h1>Teddy visits Draco</h1><p>Draco was in his 25th week of pregnancy and there was no hiding that now. He was swollen around his face and stomach. His once leans stomach now was starting I star back at him when he looked down. He could feel the baby move more. </p><p><br/></p><p>At six months pregnant, the male was actually very energized. He did cleaning around the manor (despite his mother and Bilby the House Elf objecting to it constantly) and he was doing his fair share of spending time with the kids. James especially needed his attention after the \u201ccutting\u201d episode. The boy was on anti-depressant potions, which kinda helped in that James was not a moody brat anymore. Draco wouldn\u2019t say he was \u201cback to normal\u201d but he was definitely doing better then before. </p><p><br/></p><p>Aster was still attending lessons for dancing and still ice skating like normal. Though she\u2019s lonely without her friends. She constantly messages them with that magic phone or whatever and she\u2019s been doing a lot more singing to herself (thank for noise-cancelling spells). </p><p><br/></p><p>Just as Draco was cleaning the living room for the third time that day, he heard the alarm going off on the Wards. Draco looked out the window and saw two people he hadn\u2019t seen for a while, but he could he be sure it was them? Draco was getting paranoid and why shouldn\u2019t he? If Aster\u2019s birth was anything, it was to keep this pregnancy secret. </p><p><br/></p><p>Draco went to the door and hand his wand out. \u201cTeddy?\u201d Draco asked as he saw the young man with his fianc\u00e9e and their new child, Maria. Teddy didn\u2019t seem to happy at the moment but he put a smile on for his cousin who he called \u201cUncle Draco.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHello Uncle Draco,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cDo you mind if we come in,\u201d he asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSure, come on in,\u201d he said and allowed the family to come inside. Draco raised his wand and with a wave, he turned off the alarm and reset it. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhy do you have ward around your home?\u201d Teddy asked and his eyes widen as he noticed the stomach Draco was sporting. Draco was silent and he said, \u201csit down on the dining room. We have a lot to discuss it seems,\u201d he said. </p><p><br/></p><p>Just at the moment, James came running down and he saw Teddy and his new budding family. \u201cTeddy!\u201d James jumped for joy as he hugged his god-brother. Teddy smiled and hugged back, \u201cHey little man, you\u2019re in a good mood,\u201d he smiled. James nodded and saw Maria, the small four year old smiling and waving at James. \u201cAww! Who wants to play with me?\u201d He asked in a baby voice as Victoire put the girl down. \u201cJust be careful with her James.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d James said and knelt down, \u201cwanna play unicorny?\u201d He asked and started to neigh like a horse and trotted upstairs to play with the four year old. </p><p><br/></p><p>Draco was actually more surprised by James being nice to the child rather then annoyed. He shrugged at the moment and sat down with the time. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cUncle Draco, I believe you may have heard this already, but Harry has been arrested,\u201d he said in a solemn tone, his hair shifting to the color black. </p><p><br/></p><p>Draco nodded, \u201cnever thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d Teddy asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cApparently he had been using illegal potions and neglecting children,\u201d Draco answered with honesty. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah and it has to be a lie because Harry would never hurt children!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Draco kept kid mouth shut but he asked, \u201cdid you come over to tell me this?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell yes, and one other thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSince Harry can\u2019t be at my wedding, o was wondering if you could take his place as a representative of my family,\u201d Teddy asked. Draco was shocked by the request. While he certainly had helped raise Teddy after his grandmother\u2019s (and Draco\u2019s Aunt) death, it was not to the extend of offering him a place at Teddy\u2019s family table at his wedding. Even if they had, he would still have to decline. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Teddy. I can\u2019t,\u201d Draco spoke with remorse. \u201cI can\u2019t just let anyone see me like this and I would only distract from your big day,\u201d he said. Teddy shook his head, trying to negate his assumptions, but Draco had to be firm. \u201cEdward,\u201d He said, using his first name. Draco looked at the younger man before him and hugged him dearly, \u201cFamily first. Always,\u201d he said and pulled away slowly. </p><p><br/></p><p>Teddy nodded, seemingly understand, \u201cthe invitation is always open if you decided to risk it,\u201d Teddy said and stood up. He looked to his beloved and she also stood up, \u201cso long Mr. Malfoy. And congratulations on your pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe best fetch Maria,\u201d She said as she headed upstairs to get her. </p><p><br/></p><p>Teddy looked to Draco, and the two embraced another time, \u201cHarry is proud of you Teddy. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why he\u2019s leaving you everything,\u201d he said with some pain. That made Teddy let and and pull away, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I wasn\u2019t given anything, especially not money.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBut he rewrote his will. I assumed it was for you,\u201d he said. Teddy shook his head, \u201cnothing. That money was all given to his new wife or something.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>That threw Draco for a loop, \u201cWHAT NEW WIFE?!\u201d</p>",

Draco was shocked by the request. While he certainly had helped raise Teddy after his grandmother\u2019s (and Draco\u2019s Aunt) death, it was not to the extend of offering him a place at Teddy\u2019s family table at his wedding.

Teddy shook his head, trying to negate his assumptions, but Draco had to be firm. \u201cEdward,\u201d He said, using his first name. Draco looked at the younger man before him and hugged him dearly, \u201cFamily first.

He looked to his beloved and she also stood up, \u201cso long Mr. Malfoy. And congratulations on your pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe best fetch Maria,\u201d She said as she headed upstairs to get her. </p><p><br></p><p>Teddy looked to Draco, and the two embraced another time, \u201cHarry is proud of you Teddy. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why he\u2019s leaving you everything,\u201d he said with some pain. That made Teddy let and and pull away, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I wasn\u2019t given anything, especially not money.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut he rewrote his will. I assumed it was for you,\u201d he said. Teddy shook his head, \u201cnothing.

                "content": "<p><h1>Teddy visits Draco</h1><p>Draco was in his 25th week of pregnancy and there was no hiding that now. He was swollen around his face and stomach. His once leans stomach now was starting I star back at him when he looked down. He could feel the baby move more. </p><p><br /></p><p>At six months pregnant, the male was actually very energized. He did cleaning around the manor (despite his mother and Bilby the House Elf objecting to it constantly) and he was doing his fair share of spending time with the kids. James especially needed his attention after the &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; episode. The boy was on anti-depressant potions, which kinda helped in that James was not a moody brat anymore. Draco wouldn&rsquo;t say he was &ldquo;back to normal&rdquo; but he was definitely doing better then before. </p><p><br /></p><p>Aster was still attending lessons for dancing and still ice skating like normal. Though she&rsquo;s lonely without her friends. She constantly messages them with that magic phone or whatever and she&rsquo;s been doing a lot more singing to herself (thank for noise-cancelling spells). </p><p><br /></p><p>Just as Draco was cleaning the living room for the third time that day, he heard the alarm going off on the Wards. Draco looked out the window and saw two people he hadn&rsquo;t seen for a while, but he could he be sure it was them? Draco was getting paranoid and why shouldn&rsquo;t he? If Aster&rsquo;s birth was anything, it was to keep this pregnancy secret. </p><p><br /></p><p>Draco went to the door and hand his wand out. &ldquo;Teddy?&rdquo; Draco asked as he saw the young man with his fianc&eacute;e and their new child, Maria. Teddy didn&rsquo;t seem to happy at the moment but he put a smile on for his cousin who he called &ldquo;Uncle Draco.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hello Uncle Draco,&rdquo; Teddy said. &ldquo;Do you mind if we come in,&rdquo; he asked. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure, come on in,&rdquo; he said and allowed the family to come inside. Draco raised his wand and with a wave, he turned off the alarm and reset it. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have ward around your home?&rdquo; Teddy asked and his eyes widen as he noticed the stomach Draco was sporting. Draco was silent and he said, &ldquo;sit down on the dining room. We have a lot to discuss it seems,&rdquo; he said. </p><p><br /></p><p>Just at the moment, James came running down and he saw Teddy and his new budding family. &ldquo;Teddy!&rdquo; James jumped for joy as he hugged his god-brother. Teddy smiled and hugged back, &ldquo;Hey little man, you&rsquo;re in a good mood,&rdquo; he smiled. James nodded and saw Maria, the small four year old smiling and waving at James. &ldquo;Aww! Who wants to play with me?&rdquo; He asked in a baby voice as Victoire put the girl down. &ldquo;Just be careful with her James.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; James said and knelt down, &ldquo;wanna play unicorny?&rdquo; He asked and started to neigh like a horse and trotted upstairs to play with the four year old. </p><p><br /></p><p>Draco was actually more surprised by James being nice to the child rather then annoyed.

You&rsquo;d been focusing on words on a page for so long that you didn&rsquo;t even notice it when your eyes went out of focus and you&rsquo;d stare blankly at the page in front of you. It was hard enough to do this alone, yet alone when someone was right next to you.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0Teddy had a bad habit of clicking his pen that he&rsquo;d got from a muggle friend. He&rsquo;d do it over and over until it was steady like the ticking of a clock. His thumb would press down the button once, twice, three times. Every time it sprung up, he&rsquo;d push it back down. It was a way for him to hone his focus but a way for you to lose yours. <br/>\u00a0You&rsquo;d already managed to ignore it for half an hour, surely you could ignore it for a couple of minutes more. <br/>\u00a0You were studying lethifolds for your seventh year defence test that was approaching a lot faster than you&rsquo;d like it to. You&rsquo;d made it through half of the chapter and wrote two rolls of parchment and yet it&rsquo;s now that you&rsquo;re stumped. You&rsquo;ve read the same sentence over and over and over and yet nothing seemed to register inside of your head. It was as if the words had lost all meaning, no matter how much you forced yourself to concentrate on each word nothing was making sense, the letters started to look jumbled and out of order - you couldn&rsquo;t tell if what you&rsquo;d just written was spelt right or not because the whole word looked weird. It was that damn clicking. <br/>\u00a0You slammed your hand over Teddy&rsquo;s, who&rsquo;s head snapped up from his book. His furrowed eyebrows softened when he looked at you and a soft tint of pink coloured his cheeks. You pouted, attempting to snatch the pen from his hand but he only gripped it tighter. He smirked. &lsquo;What?&rsquo;<br/>'I can&rsquo;t focus because of that damn clicking.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0Teddy let his focus move from his studies and stared off into the distance. You took that as him stopping and turned back to your book. Finding the sentence you were on before was enough of a challenge - but then it started again. You slammed your book down on the library desk, sighing and glaring with all your might at Teddy. 'Teddy!&rsquo;<br/>'What?!&rsquo;<br/>'The pen!&rsquo;<br/>'Right, sorry.&rsquo;<br/>\u00a0Teddy put the pen down on the desk this time, raising his hands as if to signal he wasn&rsquo;t going to do it again yet a strange twinkle in his eyes and a smirk told you this wouldn&rsquo;t be the end of it. Still, any opportunity to get back to work was a good one. <br/>\u00a0You buried your head back in the book, lifting your quill and scrawling a quote onto the parchment. Teddy looked down at his own book, staring at his parchment over the edge of the page and writing something down while sneaking side glances at you. He waited until you had relaxed and focused again before he pressed the edge of the button down against the wooden table. The noise was even more annoying than when he just clicked it normally. If looks could kill that livid glare would end his life a lot earlier than he expected. <br/>\u2018Teddy! Stop clicking that damn thing!\u2019<br/>\u2018Make me.\u2019 <br/>\u00a0The tone in his voice made a heat rush to your cheeks as if you\u2019d caught a fever. The air of the entire conversation had changed. Teddy knew exactly what he was doing and you weren&rsquo;t upset about it at all - if he&rsquo;d just give you fifteen minutes to finish this. <br/>\u2018T-Teddy I\u2019m trying to study,\u2019 you mumbled lifting your quill again, avoiding his fire filled gaze - but it didn\u2019t seem that Teddy was listening as he landed a hand on your thigh. Your grip on your quill tightened so much you feared the thing would snap, especially when his hands moved further up, sliding like red hot snakes.<br/>\u00a0He was eyeing you like you were a ticking time bomb, waiting for you to push his hand away and when your hand landed on his he was sure the game was over, but rather your eyes met his, parted lips and bright red cheeks. <br/> He moved forwards to kiss you, hand moving from your thigh to your hips. His other hand discarded his pen (and studying all together) when your hands moved to push through the short strands of hair on the back of his neck. <br/> The kiss lasted long enough to become heated. He seemed to forget where he was as his tongue darted out and brushed over the soft skin of your bottom lip, pushing through to explore your mouth. There was no battle for dominance, he knew what he wanted and he was going to get it. That was until you started tugging on his shirt and pulled away. <br/>\u2018I can\u2019t - we can\u2019t. We\u2019re in a library,\u2019 you whispered, cheeks still flushed and lips swollen. He could tell you wanted this as much as he did. <br/> He lent in as close as he could get, lips grazing the shell of your earlobe. \u2018Then you\u2019ll just have to be quiet won\u2019t you?\u2019 <br/>\u00a0Suddenly lethifolds were a lot less interesting. You could feel a heat rising from within you that was hard to ignore as Teddy\u2019s hands travelled. Sure - you were in a secluded corner but Madam Pince was in the isle right beside you. You tried to get the words out to warn Teddy but it was too late, his hands had slipped up under your shirt and chills rose up your spine as his hot hands roamed your stomach, landing on either side as his head swooped down to leave kiss after kiss in the crook of your neck. It was tough enough to study but it was hell to try and stay quiet when his lips were on you like that. <br/>\u00a0You moved your hand to cover your mouth, watching over Teddy\u2019s shoulder to make sure Madam Pince was still busy restocking shelves with returns. She was on the move and your eyes traced her path, she was moving to the next isle over, you were still safe. That is until Teddy found that spot on your neck and you barely managed to muffle the moan that came with it. <br/>\u00a0You felt him smirk into your skin, sucking hard on your pulse point. \u2018Shh, you don\u2019t want her to catch us do you?\u2019 He whispered, scraping the shell of your ear again. <br/>\u00a0You did your best to glare at him, but it was hard to stay angry at someone who had every intention of making you writhe underneath them. <br/>\u00a0The torture didn\u2019t end there, his lips ghosted your shoulder and before you knew it you heard the click of the clasp of your bra coming apart. You gasped, muffling it with your hand which was now pressing so hard into your face that it hurt. <br/> Teddy\u2019s hands moved to cup both of your breasts, thumb dancing over your nipples as he moved back from your neck to look at you. He landed kisses all over your cheeks before pulling your hand away and pressing his mouth onto yours. He took the opportunity to tug on one of your nipples softly but hard enough for a rippling moan to leave your throat. He swallowed the sound, tongue exploring your mouth until the second you pulled away to see where Madam Pince had got to. <br/>\u00a0She\u2019d moved another isle away but sound echoed in great big buildings like this. It was a mystery to you how she hadn\u2019t heard yet, especially when Teddy pushed his chair out and pulled you over and on to his lap. <br/>\u00a0You squeaked and this time it wasn\u2019t nearly as muffled as it should have been. Teddy froze and the both of you sat there in silence, waiting to hear Madam Pince\u2019s hurried footsteps. There was a sound like a dropping of something incredibly heavy and you moved as quickly as you could to sit back in your chair, crossing your arms over your chest and moving to hide yourself as best you could under the table. It was this moment that made you notice how hard Teddy was, the tent in his pants was huge enough to camp in and definitely made it very apparent that something had happened. You motioned for him to move forwards, to move his chair closer so Madam Pince wouldn\u2019t see it, but it was too late. <br/>\u00a0Teddy panicked, dropping a book onto his lap face down. The spine stood up so much it was as if he\u2019d trapped some kind of creature underneath there. <br/>\u2018Who was it that made that noise?\u2019 Madam Pince\u2019s voice came out like an angry growl. <br/>\u2018I think we might have a boggart in the hall, I could\u2019ve sworn I heard something on the way here,\u2019 you started. Madam Pince eyed you suspiciously, you\u2019d moved to put your head on the desk as a last ditch attempt to hide the bright purple hickeys Teddy had sucked into the skin of your neck. You smiled sleepily at her, playing it off as having studied for far too long. Teddy noticed this and let out a loud fake yawn, leaning back in his chair. <br/>\u2018I have actually heard that from another student who was here earlier, I better go fetch the defence teacher I suppose.\u2019 Madam Pince was still holding a large heavy spell book. She moved closer, terrifying both you and Teddy, but she didn\u2019t seem to see anything and rather dropped the book down on the desk and made to leave. She turned halfway to the door. \u2018Don\u2019t stay for too long, and be a dear and put that book away for me would you?\u2019 <br/>\u00a0It was a good thing the old bat was nearly too senile to hear a thing, because the loud sigh of relief both you and Teddy let out would\u2019ve been enough for her to grow suspicious - if she wasn\u2019t already suspicious enough. <br/>\u00a0Suddenly it occurred to both of you that you were completely alone in the library now and the very second you moved away from the desk, Teddy had moved you back into his lap. His hands travelled to your clothed hips where they gripped and dug in as much as they possibly could through the material of your skirt. You wouldn\u2019t have much time before she got back - before everyone got back from Hogsmede. <br/>\u2018Wait,\u2019 you said, standing up and to the side of Teddy. He sat up straight, about to ask if he\u2019d done something wrong but before he could, you\u2019d lifted your skirt.\u00a0 He started at your clothed core as if you\u2019d just flashed him a whole vault of galleons and you could\u2019ve sworn you saw him drool when you dropped your panties to the floor and lifted your jumper over your head. \u2018In case she comes back early.\u2019 You unbuttoned the top buttons of your white shirt, loosening your tie and ditching it on the table so that he could still see through it\u2019s flimsy material, but if Madam Pince returned you\u2019d have some chance of hiding yourself. <br/> When you lifted your shirt slightly from where it had been tucked in to your skirt, your bra dropped out from underneath it and without thinking, you bent over to pick them up and Teddy swore it was impossible to get any harder - it was painful at this point.<br/>\u00a0When you stood again, chucking your bra and panties to the side, you moved to do the same to Teddy\u2019s trousers. He moaned at the feeling of your fingers on his dick as you pulled them down to the ground, but it was nothing compared to when you guided him to your entrance and slowly slid down his length. His hands gripped your hair like a lifeline as you threw your head back and let out a loud moan that echoed around the entire room. <br/>\u00a0When you were ready, you placed your hands on Teddy\u2019s clothed chest and began to move. There was a strange kind of rush that came with the risk of being caught that had Teddy pushing himself into you at a faster speed, hands moving to grip your hips and guide them. You may be on top but he was still going to have control. <br/>\u00a0Everything inside of you was tensing. Your jaw tensed and your hands gripped fist fills of Teddy\u2019s jumper. He was moaning with you and the danger of being caught came again when voices echoed down the hall outside. <br/>\u2018A boggart? I thought I got rid of the pesky thing already. <br/>\u2018Students keep hearing things, maybe we can check in here.\u2019 <br/>\u00a0You were about to move off of Teddy, hoping that you would be able to get off in time to avoid being caught, but Teddy\u2019s grip only got tighter. He shook his head when you glared at him and rather he stripped himself of his tie and motioned for you to bite down on the material. Madam Pince wasn\u2019t directing the defence teacher into the library but rather into a room directly across from it but you both knew it wouldn\u2019t be long now until they ended up here. <br/>\u00a0Teddy\u2019s hips moved with even more urgency, snapping up so fast it made the chair creak and the table hit against the curve of your back, but it wasn\u2019t this that made him strip himself of his tie, as his hand moved to where your bodies met and his rough fingers started rubbing your clit. <br/>\u00a0You felt shivers of an approaching orgasm rise up through your whole body. The moan that left you came out more like a scream as his fingers continued in a rough circle. He didn\u2019t stop, not until he was muffling his own moans with shoving his face into your neck. <br/>\u00a0You tried to warn him that your orgasm was so close that you could feel every single tiny move he made, but it was too late and you let out such a loud moan that it was as if the tie had done nothing. <br/>\u00a0Your high hit you harder than anything you\u2019d ever felt before. You were too weak to even grab on to Teddy\u2019s hair. He came seconds later, thrusting up into you a few more times before he became nothing but a sweaty, huffing heap of turquoise hair. <br/>\u00a0You stayed like that for a while, brushing your fingers through his scalp and pulling the tie from your mouth. You laughed when you put it back around his neck, there was no way he was getting away with not getting asked questions about that. <br/>\u00a0He looked up at you, smiling dopily and landing a kiss on your lips. He waited until you had moved off of him to clean himself up as best he could, which lead to his next question. <br/>\u2018What are you going to do about-\u2018 He watched as you slid your panties back on. His eyes widened, staring at your legs and the wet mark that was growing bigger. \u2018My dorm. Ten minutes.\u2019\u00a0</p>",

Stop clicking that damn thing!\u2019<br>\u2018Make me.\u2019 <br>\u00a0The tone in his voice made a heat rush to your cheeks as if you\u2019d caught a fever. The air of the entire conversation had changed. Teddy knew exactly what he was doing and you weren\u2019t upset about it at all - if he\u2019d just give you fifteen minutes to finish this. <br>\u2018T-Teddy I\u2019m trying to study,\u2019 you mumbled lifting your quill again, avoiding his fire filled gaze - but it didn\u2019t seem that Teddy was listening as he landed a hand on your thigh. Your grip on your quill tightened so much you feared the thing would snap, especially when his hands moved further up, sliding like red hot snakes.<br>\u00a0He was eyeing you like you were a ticking time bomb, waiting for you to push his hand away and when your hand landed on his he was sure the game was over, but rather your eyes met his, parted lips and bright red cheeks. <br> He moved forwards to kiss you, hand moving from your thigh to your hips. His other hand discarded his pen (and studying all together) when your hands moved to push through the short strands of hair on the back of his neck. <br> The kiss lasted long enough to become heated. He seemed to forget where he was as his tongue darted out and brushed over the soft skin of your bottom lip, pushing through to explore your mouth. There was no battle for dominance, he knew what he wanted and he was going to get it. That was until you started tugging on his shirt and pulled away. <br>\u2018I can\u2019t - we can\u2019t. We\u2019re in a library,\u2019 you whispered, cheeks still flushed and lips swollen. He could tell you wanted this as much as he did. <br> He lent in as close as he could get, lips grazing the shell of your earlobe. \u2018Then you\u2019ll just have to be quiet won\u2019t you?\u2019 <br>\u00a0Suddenly lethifolds were a lot less interesting. You could feel a heat rising from within you that was hard to ignore as Teddy\u2019s hands travelled. Sure - you were in a secluded corner but Madam Pince was in the isle right beside you. You tried to get the words out to warn Teddy but it was too late, his hands had slipped up under your shirt and chills rose up your spine as his hot hands roamed your stomach, landing on either side as his head swooped down to leave kiss after kiss in the crook of your neck. It was tough enough to study but it was hell to try and stay quiet when his lips were on you like that. <br>\u00a0You moved your hand to cover your mouth, watching over Teddy\u2019s shoulder to make sure Madam Pince was still busy restocking shelves with returns. She was on the move and your eyes traced her path, she was moving to the next isle over, you were still safe. That is until Teddy found that spot on your neck and you barely managed to muffle the moan that came with it. <br>\u00a0You felt him smirk into your skin, sucking hard on your pulse point. \u2018Shh, you don\u2019t want her to catch us do you?\u2019 He whispered, scraping the shell of your ear again. <br>\u00a0You did your best to glare at him, but it was hard to stay angry at someone who had every intention of making you writhe underneath them. <br>\u00a0The torture didn\u2019t end there, his lips ghosted your shoulder and before you knew it you heard the click of the clasp of your bra coming apart. You gasped, muffling it with your hand which was now pressing so hard into your face that it hurt. <br> Teddy\u2019s hands moved to cup both of your breasts, thumb dancing over your nipples as he moved back from your neck to look at you. He landed kisses all over your cheeks before pulling your hand away and pressing his mouth onto yours. He took the opportunity to tug on one of your nipples softly but hard enough for a rippling moan to leave your throat. He swallowed the sound, tongue exploring your mouth until the second you pulled away to see where Madam Pince had got to. <br>\u00a0She\u2019d moved another isle away but sound echoed in great big buildings like this. It was a mystery to you how she hadn\u2019t heard yet, especially when Teddy pushed his chair out and pulled you over and on to his lap. <br>\u00a0You squeaked and this time it wasn\u2019t nearly as muffled as it should have been. Teddy froze and the both of you sat there in silence, waiting to hear Madam Pince\u2019s hurried footsteps. There was a sound like a dropping of something incredibly heavy and you moved as quickly as you could to sit back in your chair, crossing your arms over your chest and moving to hide yourself as best you could under the table. It was this moment that made you notice how hard Teddy was, the tent in his pants was huge enough to camp in and definitely made it very apparent that something had happened. You motioned for him to move forwards, to move his chair closer so Madam Pince wouldn\u2019t see it, but it was too late. <br>\u00a0Teddy panicked, dropping a book onto his lap face down. The spine stood up so much it was as if he\u2019d trapped some kind of creature underneath there. <br>\u2018Who was it that made that noise?\u2019 Madam Pince\u2019s voice came out like an angry growl. <br>\u2018I think we might have a boggart in the hall, I could\u2019ve sworn I heard something on the way here,\u2019 you started. Madam Pince eyed you suspiciously, you\u2019d moved to put your head on the desk as a last ditch attempt to hide the bright purple hickeys Teddy had sucked into the skin of your neck. You smiled sleepily at her, playing it off as having studied for far too long. Teddy noticed this and let out a loud fake yawn, leaning back in his chair. <br>\u2018I have actually heard that from another student who was here earlier, I better go fetch the defence teacher I suppose.\u2019 Madam Pince was still holding a large heavy spell book. She moved closer, terrifying both you and Teddy, but she didn\u2019t seem to see anything and rather dropped the book down on the desk and made to leave. She turned halfway to the door. \u2018Don\u2019t stay for too long, and be a dear and put that book away for me would you?\u2019 <br>\u00a0It was a good thing the old bat was nearly too senile to hear a thing, because the loud sigh of relief both you and Teddy let out would\u2019ve been enough for her to grow suspicious - if she wasn\u2019t already suspicious enough. <br>\u00a0Suddenly it occurred to both of you that you were completely alone in the library now and the very second you moved away from the desk, Teddy had moved you back into his lap. His hands travelled to your clothed hips where they gripped and dug in as much as they possibly could through the material of your skirt. You wouldn\u2019t have much time before she got back - before everyone got back from Hogsmede. <br>\u2018Wait,\u2019 you said, standing up and to the side of Teddy. He sat up straight, about to ask if he\u2019d done something wrong but before he could, you\u2019d lifted your skirt.\u00a0 He started at your clothed core as if you\u2019d just flashed him a whole vault of galleons and you could\u2019ve sworn you saw him drool when you dropped your panties to the floor and lifted your jumper over your head. \u2018In case she comes back early.\u2019 You unbuttoned the top buttons of your white shirt, loosening your tie and ditching it on the table so that he could still see through it\u2019s flimsy material, but if Madam Pince returned you\u2019d have some chance of hiding yourself. <br> When you lifted your shirt slightly from where it had been tucked in to your skirt, your bra dropped out from underneath it and without thinking, you bent over to pick them up and Teddy swore it was impossible to get any harder - it was painful at this point.<br>\u00a0When you stood again, chucking your bra and panties to the side, you moved to do the same to Teddy\u2019s trousers. He moaned at the feeling of your fingers on his dick as you pulled them down to the ground, but it was nothing compared to when you guided him to your entrance and slowly slid down his length. His hands gripped your hair like a lifeline as you threw your head back and let out a loud moan that echoed around the entire room. <br>\u00a0When you were ready, you placed your hands on Teddy\u2019s clothed chest and began to move. There was a strange kind of rush that came with the risk of being caught that had Teddy pushing himself into you at a faster speed, hands moving to grip your hips and guide them. You may be on top but he was still going to have control. <br>\u00a0Everything inside of you was tensing. Your jaw tensed and your hands gripped fist fills of Teddy\u2019s jumper. He was moaning with you and the danger of being caught came again when voices echoed down the hall outside. <br>\u2018A boggart? I thought I got rid of the pesky thing already. <br>\u2018Students keep hearing things, maybe we can check in here.\u2019 <br>\u00a0You were about to move off of Teddy, hoping that you would be able to get off in time to avoid being caught, but Teddy\u2019s grip only got tighter. He shook his head when you glared at him and rather he stripped himself of his tie and motioned for you to bite down on the material. Madam Pince wasn\u2019t directing the defence teacher into the library but rather into a room directly across from it but you both knew it wouldn\u2019t be long now until they ended up here. <br>\u00a0Teddy\u2019s hips moved with even more urgency, snapping up so fast it made the chair creak and the table hit against the curve of your back, but it wasn\u2019t this that made him strip himself of his tie, as his hand moved to where your bodies met and his rough fingers started rubbing your clit. <br>\u00a0You felt shivers of an approaching orgasm rise up through your whole body. The moan that left you came out more like a scream as his fingers continued in a rough circle. He didn\u2019t stop, not until he was muffling his own moans with shoving his face into your neck. <br>\u00a0You tried to warn him that your orgasm was so close that you could feel every single tiny move he made, but it was too late and you let out such a loud moan that it was as if the tie had done nothing. <br>\u00a0Your high hit you harder than anything you\u2019d ever felt before. You were too weak to even grab on to Teddy\u2019s hair. He came seconds later, thrusting up into you a few more times before he became nothing but a sweaty, huffing heap of turquoise hair. <br>\u00a0You stayed like that for a while, brushing your fingers through his scalp and pulling the tie from your mouth. You laughed when you put it back around his neck, there was no way he was getting away with not getting asked questions about that. <br>\u00a0He looked up at you, smiling dopily and landing a kiss on your lips. He waited until you had moved off of him to clean himself up as best he could, which lead to his next question. <br>\u2018What are you going to do about-\u2018 He watched as you slid your panties back on. His eyes widened, staring at your legs and the wet mark that was growing bigger. \u2018My dorm. Ten minutes.\u2019\u00a0</p>",

You\u2019d been focusing on words on a page for so long that you didn\u2019t even notice it when your eyes went out of focus and you\u2019d stare blankly at the page in front of you. It was hard enough to do this alone, yet alone when someone was right next to you.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0Teddy had a bad habit of clicking his pen that he\u2019d got from a muggle friend. He\u2019d do it over and over until it was steady like the ticking of a clock. His thumb would press down the button once, twice, three times. Every time it sprung up, he\u2019d push it back down. It was a way for him to hone his focus but a way for you to lose yours. <br>\u00a0You\u2019d already managed to ignore it for half an hour, surely you could ignore it for a couple of minutes more. <br>\u00a0You were studying lethifolds for your seventh year defence test that was approaching a lot faster than you\u2019d like it to. You\u2019d made it through half of the chapter and wrote two rolls of parchment and yet it\u2019s now that you\u2019re stumped. You\u2019ve read the same sentence over and over and over and yet nothing seemed to register inside of your head. It was as if the words had lost all meaning, no matter how much you forced yourself to concentrate on each word nothing was making sense, the letters started to look jumbled and out of order - you couldn\u2019t tell if what you\u2019d just written was spelt right or not because the whole word looked weird. It was that damn clicking. <br>\u00a0You slammed your hand over Teddy\u2019s, who\u2019s head snapped up from his book. His furrowed eyebrows softened when he looked at you and a soft tint of pink coloured his cheeks. You pouted, attempting to snatch the pen from his hand but he only gripped it tighter. He smirked. \u2018What?\u2019<br>'I can\u2019t focus because of that damn clicking.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy let his focus move from his studies and stared off into the distance. You took that as him stopping and turned back to your book. Finding the sentence you were on before was enough of a challenge - but then it started again. You slammed your book down on the library desk, sighing and glaring with all your might at Teddy. 'Teddy!\u2019<br>'What?!\u2019<br>'The pen!\u2019<br>'Right, sorry.\u2019<br>\u00a0Teddy put the pen down on the desk this time, raising his hands as if to signal he wasn\u2019t going to do it again yet a strange twinkle in his eyes and a smirk told you this wouldn\u2019t be the end of it. Still, any opportunity to get back to work was a good one. <br>\u00a0You buried your head back in the book, lifting your quill and scrawling a quote onto the parchment. Teddy looked down at his own book, staring at his parchment over the edge of the page and writing something down while sneaking side glances at you. He waited until you had relaxed and focused again before he pressed the edge of the button down against the wooden table. The noise was even more annoying than when he just clicked it normally. If looks could kill that livid glare would end his life a lot earlier than he expected. <br>\u2018Teddy! Stop clicking that damn thing!\u2019<br>\u2018Make me.\u2019 <br>\u00a0The tone in his voice made a heat rush to your cheeks as if you\u2019d caught a fever.

He didn\u2019t stop, not until he was muffling his own moans with shoving his face into your neck. <br>\u00a0You tried to warn him that your orgasm was so close that you could feel every single tiny move he made, but it was too late and you let out such a loud moan that it was as if the tie had done nothing. <br>\u00a0Your high hit you harder than anything you\u2019d ever felt before. You were too weak to even grab on to Teddy\u2019s hair. He came seconds later, thrusting up into you a few more times before he became nothing but a sweaty, huffing heap of turquoise hair. <br>\u00a0You stayed like that for a while, brushing your fingers through his scalp and pulling the tie from your mouth. You laughed when you put it back around his neck, there was no way he was getting away with not getting asked questions about that. <br>\u00a0He looked up at you, smiling dopily and landing a kiss on your lips. He waited until you had moved off of him to clean himself up as best he could, which lead to his next question. <br>\u2018What are you going to do about-\u2018 He watched as you slid your panties back on. His eyes widened, staring at your legs and the wet mark that was growing bigger. \u2018My dorm. Ten minutes.\u2019\u00a0</p>",

You&rsquo;d been focusing on words on a page for so long that you didn&rsquo;t even notice it when your eyes went out of focus and you&rsquo;d stare blankly at the page in front of you. It was hard enough to do this alone, yet alone when someone was right next to you.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;Teddy had a bad habit of clicking his pen that he&rsquo;d got from a muggle friend. He&rsquo;d do it over and over until it was steady like the ticking of a clock. His thumb would press down the button once, twice, three times. Every time it sprung up, he&rsquo;d push it back down. It was a way for him to hone his focus but a way for you to lose yours. <br />&nbsp;You&rsquo;d already managed to ignore it for half an hour, surely you could ignore it for a couple of minutes more. <br />&nbsp;You were studying lethifolds for your seventh year defence test that was approaching a lot faster than you&rsquo;d like it to. You&rsquo;d made it through half of the chapter and wrote two rolls of parchment and yet it&rsquo;s now that you&rsquo;re stumped. You&rsquo;ve read the same sentence over and over and over and yet nothing seemed to register inside of your head. It was as if the words had lost all meaning, no matter how much you forced yourself to concentrate on each word nothing was making sense, the letters started to look jumbled and out of order - you couldn&rsquo;t tell if what you&rsquo;d just written was spelt right or not because the whole word looked weird. It was that damn clicking. <br />&nbsp;You slammed your hand over Teddy&rsquo;s, who&rsquo;s head snapped up from his book. His furrowed eyebrows softened when he looked at you and a soft tint of pink coloured his cheeks. You pouted, attempting to snatch the pen from his hand but he only gripped it tighter. He smirked. &lsquo;What?&rsquo;<br />'I can&rsquo;t focus because of that damn clicking.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;Teddy let his focus move from his studies and stared off into the distance. You took that as him stopping and turned back to your book. Finding the sentence you were on before was enough of a challenge - but then it started again. You slammed your book down on the library desk, sighing and glaring with all your might at Teddy. 'Teddy!&rsquo;<br />'What?!&rsquo;<br />'The pen!&rsquo;<br />'Right, sorry.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;Teddy put the pen down on the desk this time, raising his hands as if to signal he wasn&rsquo;t going to do it again yet a strange twinkle in his eyes and a smirk told you this wouldn&rsquo;t be the end of it. Still, any opportunity to get back to work was a good one. <br />&nbsp;You buried your head back in the book, lifting your quill and scrawling a quote onto the parchment. Teddy looked down at his own book, staring at his parchment over the edge of the page and writing something down while sneaking side glances at you. He waited until you had relaxed and focused again before he pressed the edge of the button down against the wooden table. The noise was even more annoying than when he just clicked it normally. If looks could kill that livid glare would end his life a lot earlier than he expected. <br />&lsquo;Teddy! Stop clicking that damn thing!&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Make me.&rsquo; <br />&nbsp;The tone in his voice made a heat rush to your cheeks as if you&rsquo;d caught a fever. The air of the entire conversation had changed. Teddy knew exactly what he was doing and you weren&rsquo;t upset about it at all - if he&rsquo;d just give you fifteen minutes to finish this. <br />&lsquo;T-Teddy I&rsquo;m trying to study,&rsquo; you mumbled lifting your quill again, avoiding his fire filled gaze - but it didn&rsquo;t seem that Teddy was listening as he landed a hand on your thigh. Your grip on your quill tightened so much you feared the thing would snap, especially when his hands moved further up, sliding like red hot snakes.<br />&nbsp;He was eyeing you like you were a ticking time bomb, waiting for you to push his hand away and when your hand landed on his he was sure the game was over, but rather your eyes met his, parted lips and bright red cheeks. <br /> He moved forwards to kiss you, hand moving from your thigh to your hips. His other hand discarded his pen (and studying all together) when your hands moved to push through the short strands of hair on the back of his neck. <br /> The kiss lasted long enough to become heated. He seemed to forget where he was as his tongue darted out and brushed over the soft skin of your bottom lip, pushing through to explore your mouth. There was no battle for dominance, he knew what he wanted and he was going to get it. That was until you started tugging on his shirt and pulled away. <br />&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t - we can&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re in a library,&rsquo; you whispered, cheeks still flushed and lips swollen. He could tell you wanted this as much as he did. <br /> He lent in as close as he could get, lips grazing the shell of your earlobe. &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ll just have to be quiet won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; <br />&nbsp;Suddenly lethifolds were a lot less interesting. You could feel a heat rising from within you that was hard to ignore as Teddy&rsquo;s hands travelled. Sure - you were in a secluded corner but Madam Pince was in the isle right beside you. You tried to get the words out to warn Teddy but it was too late, his hands had slipped up under your shirt and chills rose up your spine as his hot hands roamed your stomach, landing on either side as his head swooped down to leave kiss after kiss in the crook of your neck. It was tough enough to study but it was hell to try and stay quiet when his lips were on you like that. <br />&nbsp;You moved your hand to cover your mouth, watching over Teddy&rsquo;s shoulder to make sure Madam Pince was still busy restocking shelves with returns. She was on the move and your eyes traced her path, she was moving to the next isle over, you were still safe. That is until Teddy found that spot on your neck and you barely managed to muffle the moan that came with it. <br />&nbsp;You felt him smirk into your skin, sucking hard on your pulse point. &lsquo;Shh, you don&rsquo;t want her to catch us do you?&rsquo; He whispered, scraping the shell of your ear again. <br />&nbsp;You did your best to glare at him, but it was hard to stay angry at someone who had every intention of making you writhe underneath them. <br />&nbsp;The torture didn&rsquo;t end there, his lips ghosted your shoulder and before you knew it you heard the click of the clasp of your bra coming apart. You gasped, muffling it with your hand which was now pressing so hard into your face that it hurt. <br /> Teddy&rsquo;s hands moved to cup both of your breasts, thumb dancing over your nipples as he moved back from your neck to look at you. He landed kisses all over your cheeks before pulling your hand away and pressing his mouth onto yours. He took the opportunity to tug on one of your nipples softly but hard enough for a rippling moan to leave your throat. He swallowed the sound, tongue exploring your mouth until the second you pulled away to see where Madam Pince had got to. <br />&nbsp;She&rsquo;d moved another isle away but sound echoed in great big buildings like this. It was a mystery to you how she hadn&rsquo;t heard yet, especially when Teddy pushed his chair out and pulled you over and on to his lap. <br />&nbsp;You squeaked and this time it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as muffled as it should have been. Teddy froze and the both of you sat there in silence, waiting to hear Madam Pince&rsquo;s hurried footsteps. There was a sound like a dropping of something incredibly heavy and you moved as quickly as you could to sit back in your chair, crossing your arms over your chest and moving to hide yourself as best you could under the table. It was this moment that made you notice how hard Teddy was, the tent in his pants was huge enough to camp in and definitely made it very apparent that something had happened. You motioned for him to move forwards, to move his chair closer so Madam Pince wouldn&rsquo;t see it, but it was too late. <br />&nbsp;Teddy panicked, dropping a book onto his lap face down. The spine stood up so much it was as if he&rsquo;d trapped some kind of creature underneath there. <br />&lsquo;Who was it that made that noise?&rsquo; Madam Pince&rsquo;s voice came out like an angry growl. <br />&lsquo;I think we might have a boggart in the hall, I could&rsquo;ve sworn I heard something on the way here,&rsquo; you started. Madam Pince eyed you suspiciously, you&rsquo;d moved to put your head on the desk as a last ditch attempt to hide the bright purple hickeys Teddy had sucked into the skin of your neck. You smiled sleepily at her, playing it off as having studied for far too long. Teddy noticed this and let out a loud fake yawn, leaning back in his chair. <br />&lsquo;I have actually heard that from another student who was here earlier, I better go fetch the defence teacher I suppose.&rsquo; Madam Pince was still holding a large heavy spell book. She moved closer, terrifying both you and Teddy, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to see anything and rather dropped the book down on the desk and made to leave. She turned halfway to the door. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stay for too long, and be a dear and put that book away for me would you?&rsquo; <br />&nbsp;It was a good thing the old bat was nearly too senile to hear a thing, because the loud sigh of relief both you and Teddy let out would&rsquo;ve been enough for her to grow suspicious - if she wasn&rsquo;t already suspicious enough. <br />&nbsp;Suddenly it occurred to both of you that you were completely alone in the library now and the very second you moved away from the desk, Teddy had moved you back into his lap. His hands travelled to your clothed hips where they gripped and dug in as much as they possibly could through the material of your skirt. You wouldn&rsquo;t have much time before she got back - before everyone got back from Hogsmede. <br />&lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; you said, standing up and to the side of Teddy. He sat up straight, about to ask if he&rsquo;d done something wrong but before he could, you&rsquo;d lifted your skirt.&nbsp; He started at your clothed core as if you&rsquo;d just flashed him a whole vault of galleons and you could&rsquo;ve sworn you saw him drool when you dropped your panties to the floor and lifted your jumper over your head. &lsquo;In case she comes back early.&rsquo; You unbuttoned the top buttons of your white shirt, loosening your tie and ditching it on the table so that he could still see through it&rsquo;s flimsy material, but if Madam Pince returned you&rsquo;d have some chance of hiding yourself. <br /> When you lifted your shirt slightly from where it had been tucked in to your skirt, your bra dropped out from underneath it and without thinking, you bent over to pick them up and Teddy swore it was impossible to get any harder - it was painful at this point.<br />&nbsp;When you stood again, chucking your bra and panties to the side, you moved to do the same to Teddy&rsquo;s trousers. He moaned at the feeling of your fingers on his dick as you pulled them down to the ground, but it was nothing compared to when you guided him to your entrance and slowly slid down his length. His hands gripped your hair like a lifeline as you threw your head back and let out a loud moan that echoed around the entire room. <br />&nbsp;When you were ready, you placed your hands on Teddy&rsquo;s clothed chest and began to move. There was a strange kind of rush that came with the risk of being caught that had Teddy pushing himself into you at a faster speed, hands moving to grip your hips and guide them. You may be on top but he was still going to have control. <br />&nbsp;Everything inside of you was tensing. Your jaw tensed and your hands gripped fist fills of Teddy&rsquo;s jumper. He was moaning with you and the danger of being caught came again when voices echoed down the hall outside. <br />&lsquo;A boggart? I thought I got rid of the pesky thing already. <br />&lsquo;Students keep hearing things, maybe we can check in here.&rsquo; <br />&nbsp;You were about to move off of Teddy, hoping that you would be able to get off in time to avoid being caught, but Teddy&rsquo;s grip only got tighter. He shook his head when you glared at him and rather he stripped himself of his tie and motioned for you to bite down on the material. Madam Pince wasn&rsquo;t directing the defence teacher into the library but rather into a room directly across from it but you both knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be long now until they ended up here. <br />&nbsp;Teddy&rsquo;s hips moved with even more urgency, snapping up so fast it made the chair creak and the table hit against the curve of your back, but it wasn&rsquo;t this that made him strip himself of his tie, as his hand moved to where your bodies met and his rough fingers started rubbing your clit. <br />&nbsp;You felt shivers of an approaching orgasm rise up through your whole body.
