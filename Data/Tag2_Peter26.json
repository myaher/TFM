        "body": "<h1>Summer Vacation Pt.1</h1><p>Peter had been vibrating with excitement both on the plane (Tony&rsquo;s private one of course, he wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead flying commercial) and in the lobby of the hotel. So much so that Stephen was afraid the teen would shimmy right out of his skin or that he and Tony would have to invest in a child leash.</p><p>The thought made the sorcerer chuckle and Peter gave him a confused glance.</p><p>The teen&rsquo;s vibrating excitement was quickly turning into nervous fidgeting once Tony started yelling at the hotel receptionist though. Apparently they had overbooked and the rooms they reserved a few days ago were not available. So Stephen decided to drag Peter over to the fountain while Tony took care of the rooming issue (and carefully watch in case things got too heated and he needed to step in) and quietly hands the boy some change. He knew Peter well enough to know he would want to do something as traditional as throwing pennies into the fountain, but Tony didn&rsquo;t carry change.</p><p>He probably didn&rsquo;t even know what it looked like anymore.</p><p>Stephen and Peter spend the next few minutes flicking change into the water until the teen looks over his shoulder to look at Tony, then turns to the sorcerer. &ldquo;Umm&hellip;Mom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad took off his sunglasses.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen whips his head around to look toward the front desk and quickly notices the growing look of terror on the receptionist&rsquo;s face. That wasn&rsquo;t good. Tony only ever took off his sunglasses to intimidate someone and he did not want to be kicked out of the hotel. So he rushes over to the desk after telling Peter not to move, and he quickly claps a hand over the engineer&rsquo;s mouth at his next words.</p><p>&ldquo;You see my kid over there?! I wanted to give him the time of his life, but you assholes&ndash;mmph!&rdquo;</p><p>The employee looks up at Stephen with some relief when the sorcerer smiles gently. &ldquo;Do you have any rooms available?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. There is one with two beds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>fine</i>.&rdquo; He says the last word with emphasis toward his muffled boyfriend. &ldquo;Mistakes happen. Like a piece of equipment short-circuiting.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony narrows his eyes at Stephen before licking the hand over his mouth, and the sorcerer pulls his hand away with a grimace. The engineer slams his card onto the counter and Stephen takes the key cards, as well as Tony&rsquo;s card, from the receptionist when the transaction is finished.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter deserves the best.&rdquo; Tony finally grumbles as they walk over to join the teen at the fountain.</p><p>&ldquo;You forget that he would be happy in a motel. He&rsquo;s still not used to having money.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyes widen. &ldquo;Wait! Aren&rsquo;t parents supposed to give their kids allowances?! No wonder he&rsquo;s not used to money!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You practically give him a daily allowance. Just this morning you threw a one hundred dollar bill at him because he was talking about a new Lego set he wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I have no memory of that.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen sighs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you turned your need to give Peter everything into a subconscious reflex. He actually caught on and tries not to tell you about anything he might want.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiles. &ldquo;Shit&hellip;I don&rsquo;t deserve this kid.&rdquo; The genius then tilts his head curiously. &ldquo;How come he&rsquo;s excited about the trip then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told him it was a reward for his grades.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Clever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been known to have my moments.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen knew that Tony had a smart-ass retort on the tip of his tongue, but the man wisely kept his mouth shut. When they approach Peter at the fountain, he jumps into excited chatter about there being fish in the fountain as Tony leads them to the elevators with a fond smile. Even before Peter became a permanent part of their family, Tony always tried to give him the world. The teen had lost so much of his family and missed out on vacations and school trips because May had trouble keeping up with his metabolism (she had to juggle two jobs) and Peter felt so bad that he never asked for anything. Not even things he needed. He eventually let it slip around Stephen about something he was missing and the sorcerer took it upon himself to tell Tony.</p><p>After May died, it took a couple of months for Peter to get used to the fact that he could eat as much as he wanted, and it took two more for him to start asking for things he <i>needed</i>. It was still a work in progress to get the boy to ask for something he wanted. That was probably what started Tony&rsquo;s habit of throwing money at Peter whenever he mentioned something in passing. Ninety percent of the time, Peter refused the money, and Tony got whatever is was he wanted for him anyway. </p><p>They exit the elevator when it reaches their floor, and when they finally reach their room, Peter snatches one of the key cards out of Stephen&rsquo;s hand and opens the door. With an excited whoop, the teen drops his bag by the bed closest to the window and flops onto it before rolling around on it.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a teenager. That&rsquo;s a dog.&rdquo; Tony grins. &ldquo;Hey Underoos, find the room service menu. You and Mama Bear can order something while I take a shower.&rdquo;</p><p>The humanoid ball of energy responds with a vigorous nod and flitters around the room while Tony ducks into the bathroom with one of his bags and Stephen carries the rest to the other bed. He throws Tony&rsquo;s on the bedside closest to the door (the man felt better knowing if someone came in, he was the one they would have to get through to get to his family) and sits with a relieved groan as he watches Peter finally pick up the menu on the minibar. The teen quickly sits next to the sorcerer and the two figure out what they want, and then Stephen calls it in as Peter retreats to his own bed.</p><p>He flops facedown onto it, buries his face into the pillow&hellip;and jetlag finally catches up with him. Quiet snores fill the room as Stephen leisurely lays back against his pillows and turns on the tv, and he looks up at Tony with amusement when the man walks out of the bathroom in a tank top and boxers.</p><p>&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen smirks. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s given the phrase &lsquo;crash and burn&rsquo; a new meaning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Might as well let him sleep until dinner gets here.&rdquo; Tony pushes his bag off the bed and joins his boyfriend on the bed. &ldquo;Did you get something for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I figured I&rsquo;d let you starve.&rdquo; Stephen replies sarcastically.</p><p>The engineer gasps dramatically. &ldquo;This is the thanks I get after everything I do for you two? Leeches! The both of you! You&rsquo;re as bad as the rest of the team!&rdquo; Stephen rolls his eyes and then pulls Tony in for a kiss. When they pull apart moments later, the genius grumbles. &ldquo;Well at least I get <i>something</i> for my trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer laughs and throws one of the decorative pillows at him. &ldquo;Incorrigible. Just for that I&rsquo;m giving your food to Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare.&rdquo;</p><p>A knock on the door echoes into the room and Tony darts out of bed, only for Stephen to lunge at him and tackle him to the floor. The loud thud of their bodies hitting the floor wakes Peter with a start, and the teen drowsily crawls off the bed and pauses in front of his wrestling parents.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dinner is here kiddo&ndash;ow my ribs!&ndash;go get it would you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter rubs his eyes as he opens the door and stops the employee before he can push the cart into the room. &ldquo;I can take it.&rdquo; </p><p>He pulls the food cart in and out of the way before grabbing his meal, stealing the remote from his parents bed, and sitting at the table by the window to eat. He didn&rsquo;t even raise an eyebrow when there was another loud thunk. He didn&rsquo;t know why Stephen and Tony were screwing around, but he wasn&rsquo;t about to ask and get in the middle of it. It would be their fault if their dinner got cold.</p><p>&ldquo;The universe has given me psychos for parents.&rdquo; Peter mutters.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard that!&rdquo; Tony yells. &ldquo;Ow! Babe&hellip;my ribs.&rdquo;</p>",

So much so that Stephen was afraid the teen would shimmy right out of his skin or that he and Tony would have to invest in a child leash.</p><p>The thought made the sorcerer chuckle and Peter gave him a confused glance.</p><p>The teen\u2019s vibrating excitement was quickly turning into nervous fidgeting once Tony started yelling at the hotel receptionist though. Apparently they had overbooked and the rooms they reserved a few days ago were not available. So Stephen decided to drag Peter over to the fountain while Tony took care of the rooming issue (and carefully watch in case things got too heated and he needed to step in) and quietly hands the boy some change. He knew Peter well enough to know he would want to do something as traditional as throwing pennies into the fountain, but Tony didn\u2019t carry change.</p><p>He probably didn\u2019t even know what it looked like anymore.</p><p>Stephen and Peter spend the next few minutes flicking change into the water until the teen looks over his shoulder to look at Tony, then turns to the sorcerer. \u201cUmm\u2026Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad took off his sunglasses.\u201d</p><p>Stephen whips his head around to look toward the front desk and quickly notices the growing look of terror on the receptionist\u2019s face. That wasn\u2019t good. Tony only ever took off his sunglasses to intimidate someone and he did not want to be kicked out of the hotel. So he rushes over to the desk after telling Peter not to move, and he quickly claps a hand over the engineer\u2019s mouth at his next words.</p><p>\u201cYou see my kid over there?! I wanted to give him the time of his life, but you assholes\u2013mmph!\u201d</p><p>The employee looks up at Stephen with some relief when the sorcerer smiles gently. \u201cDo you have any rooms available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There is one with two beds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>fine</i>.\u201d He says the last word with emphasis toward his muffled boyfriend. \u201cMistakes happen. Like a piece of equipment short-circuiting.\u201d</p><p>Tony narrows his eyes at Stephen before licking the hand over his mouth, and the sorcerer pulls his hand away with a grimace. The engineer slams his card onto the counter and Stephen takes the key cards, as well as Tony\u2019s card, from the receptionist when the transaction is finished.</p><p>\u201cPeter deserves the best.\u201d Tony finally grumbles as they walk over to join the teen at the fountain.</p><p>\u201cYou forget that he would be happy in a motel. He\u2019s still not used to having money.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWait! Aren\u2019t parents supposed to give their kids allowances?! No wonder he\u2019s not used to money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou practically give him a daily allowance. Just this morning you threw a one hundred dollar bill at him because he was talking about a new Lego set he wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026I have no memory of that.\u201d</p><p>Stephen sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s because you turned your need to give Peter everything into a subconscious reflex. He actually caught on and tries not to tell you about anything he might want.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles. \u201cShit\u2026I don\u2019t deserve this kid.\u201d The genius then tilts his head curiously. \u201cHow come he\u2019s excited about the trip then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him it was a reward for his grades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been known to have my moments.\u201d</p><p>Stephen knew that Tony had a smart-ass retort on the tip of his tongue, but the man wisely kept his mouth shut. When they approach Peter at the fountain, he jumps into excited chatter about there being fish in the fountain as Tony leads them to the elevators with a fond smile. Even before Peter became a permanent part of their family, Tony always tried to give him the world. The teen had lost so much of his family and missed out on vacations and school trips because May had trouble keeping up with his metabolism (she had to juggle two jobs) and Peter felt so bad that he never asked for anything. Not even things he needed. He eventually let it slip around Stephen about something he was missing and the sorcerer took it upon himself to tell Tony.</p><p>After May died, it took a couple of months for Peter to get used to the fact that he could eat as much as he wanted, and it took two more for him to start asking for things he <i>needed</i>. It was still a work in progress to get the boy to ask for something he wanted. That was probably what started Tony\u2019s habit of throwing money at Peter whenever he mentioned something in passing. Ninety percent of the time, Peter refused the money, and Tony got whatever is was he wanted for him anyway. </p><p>They exit the elevator when it reaches their floor, and when they finally reach their room, Peter snatches one of the key cards out of Stephen\u2019s hand and opens the door. With an excited whoop, the teen drops his bag by the bed closest to the window and flops onto it before rolling around on it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a teenager. That\u2019s a dog.\u201d Tony grins. \u201cHey Underoos, find the room service menu. You and Mama Bear can order something while I take a shower.\u201d</p><p>The humanoid ball of energy responds with a vigorous nod and flitters around the room while Tony ducks into the bathroom with one of his bags and Stephen carries the rest to the other bed. He throws Tony\u2019s on the bedside closest to the door (the man felt better knowing if someone came in, he was the one they would have to get through to get to his family) and sits with a relieved groan as he watches Peter finally pick up the menu on the minibar. The teen quickly sits next to the sorcerer and the two figure out what they want, and then Stephen calls it in as Peter retreats to his own bed.</p><p>He flops facedown onto it, buries his face into the pillow\u2026and jetlag finally catches up with him. Quiet snores fill the room as Stephen leisurely lays back against his pillows and turns on the tv, and he looks up at Tony with amusement when the man walks out of the bathroom in a tank top and boxers.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>Stephen smirks. \u201cHe\u2019s given the phrase \u2018crash and burn\u2019 a new meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well let him sleep until dinner gets here.\u201d Tony pushes his bag off the bed and joins his boyfriend on the bed. \u201cDid you get something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I figured I\u2019d let you starve.\u201d Stephen replies sarcastically.</p><p>The engineer gasps dramatically. \u201cThis is the thanks I get after everything I do for you two? Leeches! The both of you! You\u2019re as bad as the rest of the team!\u201d Stephen rolls his eyes and then pulls Tony in for a kiss. When they pull apart moments later, the genius grumbles. \u201cWell at least I get <i>something</i> for my trouble.\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer laughs and throws one of the decorative pillows at him. \u201cIncorrigible. Just for that I\u2019m giving your food to Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>A knock on the door echoes into the room and Tony darts out of bed, only for Stephen to lunge at him and tackle him to the floor.

Tony had eaten every last thing Peter has made him, trying to make Peter eat his as well. He had pulled Peter to bed, careful to avoid his healing cut. He had held Peter tightly, whispering apologies and praise and sweet nothings into Peter&rsquo;s hair. As Peter had drifting off to sleep, he begged Peter to stay with him, to never leave.\u00a0</p><p>A week later, Peter seems to be doing better. There&rsquo;s no evidence left of the cut, and his eyes are bright and curious and shiny again. Tony is so happy Peter is okay.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I want to talk about it.&rdquo; Peter insists.\u00a0</p><p>Tony swallows thickly. &ldquo;Alright&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks at his crossed hands. &ldquo;I&hellip; you ignored me for so long, I thought you didn&rsquo;t love me anymore. You took away my Spider-Man privileges. It scares me, how much control you have over me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony feels his breath hitch. He didn&rsquo;t think of it like that, but he has way too much power over this kid. He&rsquo;s his boss, mentor, landlord, sole provider of funds, all on top of being his boyfriend. He had never thought of how much power he truly has over his boyfriend, but now that he sees?</p><p>He would tell anyone in this situation to leave, go to an abuse shelter.\u00a0</p><p>Tony feels sick.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m going to fix that.&rdquo; He whispers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make it so I don&rsquo;t have any power over you at all. I will, I&rsquo;ll start-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, Tony. Calm down.&rdquo; Peter smiles and takes his hand. &ldquo;Baby steps, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony takes a deep breath. He doesn&rsquo;t do baby steps. He dives in, he tears off the Band-Aid, he charges in without thought.</p><p>Peter sighs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just scared. I don&rsquo;t like having so little control. So I&hellip; I wanted to ask you to take away your access to my suit. I know it&rsquo;s b-big, but I&ndash;I need to know you won&rsquo;t take it away from me, because you&rsquo;re scared.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nods. &ldquo;Done. F.R.I.D.A.Y? Make sure I can&rsquo;t access his suit without Peter&rsquo;s express permission. Make sure I can&rsquo;t take it; if I have it, make sure Karen had orders from Peter to give it to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sighs in relief. &ldquo;Thank you, Tony. This really means a lot to me.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>Okay, so maybe, maybe Tony went over board.\u00a0</p><p>He opened a bank account for Peter and put $25,000,000 in it. He bought Peter a house, paid for in full, no payments necessary. He bought Peter two cars to put in the garage of that house. He filled it with furniture and electronics, filled the pantry with food that&rsquo;ll never go out of date. Filled his closet with clothes that he thinks Peter will like. Puts a back up A.I. in it, fully functional. When he&rsquo;s satisfied, he tells the A.I. to make sure he never has access to this bank account, and he isn&rsquo;t allowed on the property. He tells the A.I. that as soon as Tony leaves today, he is only to listen to Peter Parker, unless Peter tells the A.I. otherwise.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as he leaves, he knows he made the right decision, though. If Peter wants to leave Tony, he can. He&rsquo;ll have more than enough money, a place to live, an A.I. to take care of him. He&rsquo;ll have the suit. The only thing Tony can&rsquo;t promise Peter should he leave is a mentor.</p><p>he fixes that very quickly, though. He talks to Steve, and after a lot of dodged questions and worries for Tony&rsquo;s health, he has Steve&rsquo;s word that he&rsquo;ll take Peter under his wing should something happen to Tony.</p><p>He tells Friday to tell Peter all of this, should Tony die, or should Peter leave Tony for any reason at all.</p><p>For the first time since Tony saw Peter bleeding in his tub, Tony sleeps through the night.</p><p>~</p><p>It takes months of therapy, of endless support from his friends, May, and Tony, of tireless work on Peter&rsquo;s part; but Peter is better again. He feels confident in himself, in his ability to be Spider-Man. In his studies at college, in his relationship with Tony. In his ability to leave, if he wanted to.</p><p>Tony hopes beyond hope that Peter will never need the house in his name, the bank account he&rsquo;s the only one to have access to. He hopes to never lose Peter, that Peter will never leave him. But he&rsquo;s able to sleep at night, knowing Peter is in control of himself. That he has all the power of himself. That he&rsquo;s here, because he wants to be. Not because he&rsquo;s scared of living without Tony.</p><p>Tony still wakes up in cold sweats, sometimes. He has to lean over, check that Peter is safe. He can&rsquo;t go into that spare bathroom anymore, but he sometimes cracks the door open, to make sure Peter isn&rsquo;t in there, in a bathtub filled with pink water and unseeing eyes. He has to check every camera in the city, sometimes, to make sure Peter is alive and fighting. He still has nightmares, but when he wakes up, Peter is next to him. Full of blood and breath and life. Safe.\u00a0</p><p>He knows that Peter knows. He can see it in the way Peter pets his hair as they drift off to sleep, making Tony listen to his heartbeat. He sees the way Peter looks at him, when Tony comes to find him after checking the bathroom. In the way Peter sometimes sends Selfies of himself in the suit, after kicking ass. In the way Peter turned his location on to Tony, so Tony can see where he is.\u00a0</p><p>(He tries not to check that, but eventually he reasons it&rsquo;s less invasive than checking every camera in the city.)</p><p>But Tony learned his lesson, and tried to fix himself. To make sure he never makes Peter feel that way again. They have fights, but Tony makes Peter sleep in his bed. Even if they aren&rsquo;t talking. And Peter huffs angrily, but forces Tony&rsquo;s head to lay on his chest.</p><p>They make it through okay. They make it, because they both put the effort in. Not only to fix themselves, but to avoid breaking themselves again in the future.</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t perfect, but nothing ever is. Tony can settle for good enough, for happiness, for safety. He can settle for as close to perfect as Tony and Peter can get.</p><p>And Peter can too, because he knows he&rsquo;ll be just fine without Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Peter has complete control over himself, and he can leave if he wants. And not by killing himself. He has the control.</p><p>Peter Parker has control, and he feels safe. He forgave Tony Stark for what he did, and is happy Tony Stark has made an effort to be better.\u00a0</p>",

There\u2019s no evidence left of the cut, and his eyes are bright and curious and shiny again. Tony is so happy Peter is okay.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about it.\u201d Peter insists.\u00a0</p><p>Tony swallows thickly. \u201cAlright\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter looks at his crossed hands. \u201cI\u2026 you ignored me for so long, I thought you didn\u2019t love me anymore. You took away my Spider-Man privileges. It scares me, how much control you have over me.\u201d</p><p>Tony feels his breath hitch. He didn\u2019t think of it like that, but he has way too much power over this kid. He\u2019s his boss, mentor, landlord, sole provider of funds, all on top of being his boyfriend. He had never thought of how much power he truly has over his boyfriend, but now that he sees?</p><p>He would tell anyone in this situation to leave, go to an abuse shelter.\u00a0</p><p>Tony feels sick.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m going to fix that.\u201d He whispers. \u201cI\u2019m going to make it so I don\u2019t have any power over you at all. I will, I\u2019ll start-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, Tony. Calm down.\u201d Peter smiles and takes his hand. \u201cBaby steps, please.\u201d</p><p>Tony takes a deep breath. He doesn\u2019t do baby steps. He dives in, he tears off the Band-Aid, he charges in without thought.</p><p>Peter sighs. \u201cI\u2019m just scared. I don\u2019t like having so little control. So I\u2026 I wanted to ask you to take away your access to my suit. I know it\u2019s b-big, but I\u2013I need to know you won\u2019t take it away from me, because you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods. \u201cDone. F.R.I.D.A.Y? Make sure I can\u2019t access his suit without Peter\u2019s express permission. Make sure I can\u2019t take it; if I have it, make sure Karen had orders from Peter to give it to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter sighs in relief. \u201cThank you, Tony. This really means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Okay, so maybe, maybe Tony went over board.\u00a0</p><p>He opened a bank account for Peter and put $25,000,000 in it. He bought Peter a house, paid for in full, no payments necessary. He bought Peter two cars to put in the garage of that house. He filled it with furniture and electronics, filled the pantry with food that\u2019ll never go out of date. Filled his closet with clothes that he thinks Peter will like. Puts a back up A.I. in it, fully functional. When he\u2019s satisfied, he tells the A.I. to make sure he never has access to this bank account, and he isn\u2019t allowed on the property. He tells the A.I. that as soon as Tony leaves today, he is only to listen to Peter Parker, unless Peter tells the A.I. otherwise.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as he leaves, he knows he made the right decision, though. If Peter wants to leave Tony, he can. He\u2019ll have more than enough money, a place to live, an A.I. to take care of him. He\u2019ll have the suit. The only thing Tony can\u2019t promise Peter should he leave is a mentor.</p><p>he fixes that very quickly, though. He talks to Steve, and after a lot of dodged questions and worries for Tony\u2019s health, he has Steve\u2019s word that he\u2019ll take Peter under his wing should something happen to Tony.</p><p>He tells Friday to tell Peter all of this, should Tony die, or should Peter leave Tony for any reason at all.</p><p>For the first time since Tony saw Peter bleeding in his tub, Tony sleeps through the night.</p><p>~</p><p>It takes months of therapy, of endless support from his friends, May, and Tony, of tireless work on Peter\u2019s part; but Peter is better again. He feels confident in himself, in his ability to be Spider-Man. In his studies at college, in his relationship with Tony. In his ability to leave, if he wanted to.</p><p>Tony hopes beyond hope that Peter will never need the house in his name, the bank account he\u2019s the only one to have access to. He hopes to never lose Peter, that Peter will never leave him. But he\u2019s able to sleep at night, knowing Peter is in control of himself. That he has all the power of himself. That he\u2019s here, because he wants to be. Not because he\u2019s scared of living without Tony.</p><p>Tony still wakes up in cold sweats, sometimes. He has to lean over, check that Peter is safe. He can\u2019t go into that spare bathroom anymore, but he sometimes cracks the door open, to make sure Peter isn\u2019t in there, in a bathtub filled with pink water and unseeing eyes. He has to check every camera in the city, sometimes, to make sure Peter is alive and fighting. He still has nightmares, but when he wakes up, Peter is next to him. Full of blood and breath and life. Safe.\u00a0</p><p>He knows that Peter knows. He can see it in the way Peter pets his hair as they drift off to sleep, making Tony listen to his heartbeat. He sees the way Peter looks at him, when Tony comes to find him after checking the bathroom. In the way Peter sometimes sends Selfies of himself in the suit, after kicking ass. In the way Peter turned his location on to Tony, so Tony can see where he is.\u00a0</p><p>(He tries not to check that, but eventually he reasons it\u2019s less invasive than checking every camera in the city.)</p><p>But Tony learned his lesson, and tried to fix himself. To make sure he never makes Peter feel that way again. They have fights, but Tony makes Peter sleep in his bed. Even if they aren\u2019t talking. And Peter huffs angrily, but forces Tony\u2019s head to lay on his chest.</p><p>They make it through okay. They make it, because they both put the effort in. Not only to fix themselves, but to avoid breaking themselves again in the future.</p><p>It isn\u2019t perfect, but nothing ever is. Tony can settle for good enough, for happiness, for safety. He can settle for as close to perfect as Tony and Peter can get.</p><p>And Peter can too, because he knows he\u2019ll be just fine without Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Peter has complete control over himself, and he can leave if he wants. And not by killing himself. He has the control.</p><p>Peter Parker has control, and he feels safe. He forgave Tony Stark for what he did, and is happy Tony Stark has made an effort to be better.\u00a0</p>",
