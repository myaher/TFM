He hates having to clean the entire coffee machine inside and out. He hates the pressure of counting the money in the till, especially as he sucks at maths.</p><p>He hates having to wipe down every table and surface. He hates having to restock the milk in the fridge and the sugar on the counter. He loathes having to switch off every single light one by one, letting the shadows crawl out of their corners and smother the place. He usually does this final task at the last possible moment, so that he can just walk straight to the door and leave as soon as possible. The caf\u00e9, which is quite a sweet, pretty place with a soft, happy feel in the daytime, becomes something evil in the dark.</p><p>Tonight however, it\u2019s not so bad. The late shift is given to Dan at least once a week, because he\u2019s worked here a lot longer than most of the other staff, and so can be trusted. He\u2019s done it so many times that he could do it blindfolded, he\u2019s sure, so Louise allows him to do it on his own.</p><p>Tonight, he\u2019s not on his own.</p><!-- more --><p>Phil walked to work with him today, and has stayed ever since. He has seemed perfectly content all evening, sat at a table for two in the corner by the window, drawing in his sketchpad. He\u2019s ordered at least three coffees, which he\u2019ll probably regret once he gets home and can\u2019t sleep, but Dan isn\u2019t going to lecture him again. The last customer left around twenty minutes ago, and Phil is still there, frowning down at whatever he\u2019s sketching. Dan has just finished counting up, so he walks over to Phil\u2019s table to collect the mug he\u2019s been drinking from.</p><p>\u201cYou planning on sleeping here?\u201d He asks, picking up the mug and saucer.</p><p>Phil looks up at him in surprise. \u201cOh, hey let me take that.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts at him. \u201cIt\u2019s literally my job, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Dan walks away then, shaking his head fondly at Phil\u2019s owlish protestations.</p><p>\u201cAm I slowing you down?\u201d Phil calls as Dan heads into the kitchen. \u201cI can go if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan calls back, rinsing the crockery before stacking it into the dishwasher. \u201cJust don\u2019t make a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of creepy here after hours,\u201d Phil says as Dan walks back out. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it all on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on my own,\u201d Dan counters.</p><p>There\u2019s a hesitance on Phil\u2019s face when Dan glances at him. \u201cYou think I\u2019m nuts, don\u2019t you? For going through with the date.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks away, busying himself with stacking chairs. The scraping of the legs on the tiled floor makes him wince. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly brave.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts. \u201cBrave. Because you think it\u2019s a joke. That she doesn\u2019t actually like me, and that she\u2019s doing it to get back at Hardy.\u201d</p><p>A chair clatters from Dan\u2019s hands, and he curses. Instead of picking it back up, he turns to Phil. \u201cIt might have crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s what everyone thinks,\u201d Phil says, shrugging. \u201cThat she\u2019s just using me. I get it. It\u2019s ridiculous to think she\u2019d actually consider me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with you, Phil,\u201d Dan says quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s just how they are in the Elite. They don\u2019t think about the feelings of people like us. The only time they even acknowledge us is if we can benefit their lives in some way. Getting them coffee. Giving them lifts home. Making their boyfriend\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Phil says dismissively, frowning in an uncharacteristic way. \u201cI\u2019m still gonna go through with it.\u201d</p><p>Getting through to Phil is like trying to get through to the floor beneath his feet. </p><p>\u201cEven if you know for sure that she\u2019s stringing you along?\u201d Dan asks, barely disguising his frustration. \u201cPhil, that\u2019s suicidal. If she\u2019s purposefully dangling you in front of Hardy Jenns you\u2019re gonna get your ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s her intention going in, that\u2019s her problem. I\u2019m gonna change her mind by the time the date is over,\u201d Phil says confidently. </p><p>\u201cOkay, now I do think you\u2019re nuts,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He begins stacking the chairs again, loudly and with a recklessness that he wouldn\u2019t normally. He should drop this, change the subject or something. But the irritation is overwhelming. Phil can\u2019t see two feet under his nose. He\u2019s being stubborn, because he feels he has to prove he can go through with this now, even though every star in the sky is screaming at him to turn back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a lot, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can see that,\u201d Dan says, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Phil insists. \u00a0I think I can make her see that it\u2019s better to be in the real world with the rest of us, rather than up in the clouds of the Elite. That she\u2019d be happier without all the drama and the materialism and the seedy guys.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cHow\u2019re you gonna show her that, exactly? What\u2019ve you got to offer her apart from a paintbrush and some overpriced jewellery? I mean, have you even properly kissed a girl?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mean it to come out so harshly, but he\u2019s angry, and his tongue doesn\u2019t listen to him when he gets into a state. He shuts his eyes, placing the chair in his hands down.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says bitterly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right,\u201d Phil interrupts. He stands slowly from his chair and lifts it onto the table. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever kissed one person. It\u2019s been worrying me a little, actually.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares at him through the legs of several chairs, trying to think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cYou think Amanda would notice something like that?\u201d Phil asks, meeting Dan\u2019s eye. His raw, genuine concern is so obvious in his expression that Dan has to tear his gaze away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He can\u2019t stop himself saying it, because it\u2019s the truth. \u201cAmanda Jones isn\u2019t likely to be fooled by an amateur kiss, if you ask me. That babe\u2019s got plenty of battle scars.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolls his eyes at the wording, but catches hold of his lower lip between his teeth, worrying it to and fro. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods slowly, leaning against an unstacked table for some support. Something about this conversation feels dangerous. Dan can feel his heart racing, his palms growing damp. He swallows thickly, mouth suddenly dry. </p><p>\u201cWell, if you think you can deliver a kiss that kills, you probably can,\u201d Dan says, one shoulder shrugging. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil says hurriedly, taking a step towards him. \u201cI\u2019m no expert.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares at him.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s all about, like,\u201d Dan flounders, feeling himself grow red. \u201cConfidence.\u201d</p><p>Phil ducks his chin towards his chest, then peers up at Dan, eyes sparkling with mischief. Before Dan can react, Phil\u2019s closing the short distance between them in three long strides, pushing him up against the table behind him. Dan\u2019s lungs seize up, but manages to gather himself enough to prevent himself from squealing at the unexpected attack.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Phil asks. </p><p>He\u2019s smirking like it\u2019s a stupid joke, but Dan\u2019s breaths are still getting stuck in his throat. Dan rolls his eyes, but there\u2019s no way Phil can\u2019t hear the hammering of his heart. </p><p>\u201cYeah, just ram her up against the table,\u201d Dan says, ever the sarcastic bitch. \u201cShe definitely won\u2019t find that creepy.\u201d</p><p>Phil snickers. \u201cYou seem to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>Instead of obeying Dan\u2019s command, Phil seizes hold of him by the thighs and lifts him deftly onto the tabletop, slotting himself between Dan\u2019s legs. At this point, Dan is sure he\u2019ll combust, so he focuses all of his attention on the tasks he has left to do before locking up tonight. <i>Mop the floor in the kitchen, put the float into the safe, kick Phil in the balls for being such a fucking tease\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cSo, what next?\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, Dan glares at him, struggling to break free of Phil\u2019s hold. \u201cForget it, I did not sign up to be your snogging tutor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m literally begging,\u201d Phil says, letting slip a sudden flash of the insecurity lurking beneath his flirtatious demeanour. \u201cI just need to know if I suck. I just need to be <i>passable</i>. You can help me, I know you can.\u201d</p><p>Dan is far, far too soft, he thinks, melting immediately, of course. Any resistance he may once have had was dissolved a few nights ago, in Phil\u2019s bed, when the realisation of his own feelings for the man avalanched down upon him. He\u2019s been trapped underneath the debris of that revelation ever since, struggling to breathe, aching and tortured, awaiting rescue that won\u2019t come. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d Dan says, as if it\u2019s some huge inconvenience. </p><p>Phil\u2019s hands release Dan\u2019s thighs, clapping together in glee. \u201cThank you, Dan. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, your debt to me is higher than all of England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, so what do I do now?\u201d</p><p>Dan struggles to focus, but catches sight of Phil\u2019s frantically fidgeting hands. He can start with that, at least. \u201cWhat are you gonna do with your hands?\u201d</p><p>Phil blinks at him, confused. \u201cUh, it- it depends-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan tells him firmly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t depend. They go on my- on her hips.\u201d He blushes, waiting for this to register, but Phil just stares. \u00a0\u201cDo it, you pleb.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles nervously, but reaches out to place his hands on Dan\u2019s hips. They\u2019re just resting there, light as anything, but the touch of him, light and warm, still makes Dan want to cry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cShe\u2019ll um- she\u2019ll probably do this.\u201d</p><p>Dan stretches his own arms out, reaching up until he\u2019s got them locked around Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019d do?\u201d Phil asks, his voice sounding strange and thin. \u201cIf I were- if it were you being kissed?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs, disliking the question. \u201cProb\u2019ly.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, drinking down the information like it\u2019s gold. \u201cOkay, what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, close your eyes,\u201d Dan instructs, and Phil does. He\u2019s so passively beautiful. All pale skin and dark lashes. Dan is not in any way ready for what\u2019s about to happen here. How the fuck did he get himself into this situation? \u201cNow, lean in really close to me, but\u2026 don\u2019t touch me yet.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no denying that at this point, self indulgence has come into play. Dan can\u2019t bring himself to feel too bad about it. He\u2019s never going to get an opportunity like this again, and in all likelihood Phil\u2019s too clueless to cotton on to whether Dan might be a little biased in his instruction. Phil closes some of the distance between them, their lips close now; Dan tightens his lock around Phil\u2019s neck. He smells like the caramel macchiatos Dan\u2019s been making for him all evening.</p><p>He lets Phil wait for it. In Dan\u2019s opinion, the best part about a kiss is the build up. It\u2019s the space between them, humming with an electric yearning. It\u2019s the eyes darting to one another\u2019s mouths, and the slow, careful dance around the minefield of wrong moves as they work up to it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan whispers, knowing his breath will sizzle against Phil\u2019s lips. He feels Phil shiver, and it makes his stomach flip. \u201cNow, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Phil does as told. He seems a little stunned to see Dan up so close.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, their noses brushing. \u201cTell her something.\u201d</p><p>Phil frowns. \u201cTell her what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d Dan near-whispers. For some reason, his eyes sting. He focuses them on Phil\u2019s tongue as it sweeps over his lower lip. \u201cTell her she\u2019s got pretty eyes, or she\u2019s a hot babe. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling her she\u2019s a hot babe,\u201d Phil says, rolling his eyes. He seems a little pink-cheeked, though. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not telling you you\u2019re a hot babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me something else, then,\u201d Dan says before he can stop himself. \u201cI mean, pretend I\u2019m her. <i>Amanda</i>. And tell me what you want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend you\u2019re her?\u201d Phil asks, eyes roving over Dan\u2019s face as though it\u2019s an impossible feat.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a stretch Phil, but try it.\u201d</p><p>Phil is silent, his lips pressing together as he surveys Dan, still so close that he\u2019s probably all blurry in Phil\u2019s vision anyway. Eventually, Dan kicks him.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he prompts, heart stuttering already. </p><p>His palms have gone past clammy into damp; he feels a bit dizzy, from the coffees he\u2019s been drinking, and the cigarette he hasn\u2019t had yet. This is something from his wildest, most surreal dreams, something he honestly never thought would happen, and here it is, right in front of him. He blinks, but it doesn\u2019t go away. Phil is still so irresistibly close, the blue around his eyes thinned to a sliver, his heartbeat loud enough to hear. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing\u2026\u201d Phil starts to say, his voice slow and quiet. \u201cI have ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s breath catches, and he feels his eyes sting again. He nods. \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cNow kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes widen, but he leans forwards readily. Dan\u2019s breath hitches again, and he finds himself drawing back a little.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says hurriedly. He fixes Phil with a hard stare, trying to appear as unaffected as possible. \u201cIf you stick your tongue in my mouth, I will bite it off, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, looking a little relieved, and nods. Then, the hands on his hips yank him forwards, and Dan is being kissed. Slowly at first, tentative and unsure, but then harder, hungrier, as though some levee inside of Phil has broken. His hands tighten on Dan\u2019s hips, fingers pushing into Dan\u2019s skin, so hard it could bruise.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips drag Dan\u2019s apart; he flicks his tongue against Dan\u2019s lip ring, then pushes it into Dan\u2019s mouth, breaking the one, singular rule Dan had given him, but he finds he doesn\u2019t even care. He never meant it anyway. He likes tongue. He would give anything not to know the taste of Phil\u2019s, but only because he\u2019ll never know it again. </p><p>He tastes like coffee, and caramel, and the bitter lead of his pencil when he licks the tip. Dan whimpers as these flavours unfurl across his taste buds; he pulls himself closer to Phil by the vice grip he has around his neck.</p><p>They kiss for what feels like hours, but it still isn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s a sudden vibration against his thigh, from what must be the phone in Phil\u2019s pocket. Like a shock of icy water thrown in his face, he remembers the time. He remembers the day, his own name, his tragedy of a life, and more importantly, who Phil is thinking about right now.</p><p>Somehow, along with the surge of disgust for himself that rises like bile in his throat, Dan manages to summon the strength to unwind his arms from Phil\u2019s neck and shove, hard, against his chest. Phil stumbles backwards, shocked, his lips wet and reddened. There\u2019s an indent in their corner from where Dan\u2019s lip ring has pressed into his flesh, and the sight of it is making Dan want to throw up.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, Phil,\u201d Dan pants, staring at him. Phil just stares, stunned, breathing heavily. \u201cYou don\u2019t need lessons, okay? You\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, hands braced against the table as he tries to gain some control. How did he just let that happen? He is so, so fucked.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil says at last. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what- you\u2019re just so, um, pretty, and it was all nice and familiar- I guess I just\u2026 I got carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarried away,\u201d Dan repeats with a humourless laugh, still breathless. \u201cJust a little.\u201d</p><p>Phil ducks his head, his cheeks a little flushed. \u201cThanks, though. For helping me.\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head, barely able to believe his ears. He feels a rush of hot, stinging anger flooding his veins, and he glares at Phil, unable to suppress it.</p><p>\u201cSure. What else am I here for, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the only thing I\u2019m good for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dan spits out. He stands from the table on jelly legs, untying his apron and yanking it off. \u201cAs the town whore, you might as well use me for practise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, what- that is not why I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Dan growls, stalking past Phil towards the kitchen.</p><p>He pushes through the door, trying to ignore that his throat feels like he\u2019s swallowed a lump of burning hot coal.\t</p><p>\u201cDan, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Phil calls from the caf\u00e9 floor. Dan leans his head back against the kitchen door separating them, shutting his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, I just- fuck. Please don\u2019t be annoyed.\u201d</p><p>Dan bites down hard on his lip, hating that he can still taste Phil there, all sickly sweet syrup and a rich, malty aftertaste.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Phil calls out again. \u201cPlease talk to me.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a push from the other side of the door, jolting Dan forwards. He moves out of its path, letting Phil swing it open. He stands in the doorway, looking shame-faced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan sighs, running a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2026 happened. Let\u2019s just move the fuck on.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, still a little dazed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, brushing past him as he goes to finish closing up the caf\u00e9. Phil just watches him perform the medial little tasks that need doing with a glazed expression, looking like a lost child.<br/>Dan is about a hundred percent sure he missed something on his to-do list by the time he gets his jacket, but he can\u2019t be bothered to check. Louise can yell at him, he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Dan says to Phil, his voice gruff still.</p><p>He walks to the door, jingling the keys, and opens it for Phil to step out into the dark street. Dan switches all the lights off without looking back, and follows him outside to lock the doors.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d Phil says, as if Dan hadn\u2019t noticed the moisture pelting him from above.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d Dan replies, turning the final lock.</p><p>\u201cCan I come over?\u201d</p><p>Dan freezes, trying not to react. He turns to Phil slowly, a frown creasing his brow. \u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Phil cocks his head like a spaniel. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Dan purses his lips, looking up at the rainclouds, invisible in the dark. \u201cSeveral reasons.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mention that one of them is that he needs some time to privately flip the memory of Phil kissing him over and over in his mad, analytical brain until it\u2019s wrung dry. He can already tell that that moment in time will forever be etched into his brain, just like his hips will always feel the ghost of Phil\u2019s grip, and his lips\u2026 well. No other kiss will ever again mean anything, Dan is sure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Prom tomorrow,\u201d Phil says, his voice small. Dan rolls his eyes, wondering if Phil really thinks he could have forgotten when it\u2019s literally all they\u2019ve talked about for weeks. \u201cYou\u2019re still gonna drive us, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs, desperately wishing he had enough spine to refuse right now. \u201cSaid I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He stuffs the keys into his pocket, flicks up the hood of his jacket and starts walking down the street. Phil follows at his side, hands stuffed into the pocket of his hoodie. Silvery puffs of air escape from his mouth as he breathes; suddenly, Dan remembers his vice, digging into his back pocket. The packet\u2019s a little damp, but he pulls a cigarette out with his teeth, uncaring.</p><p>\u201cI just thought maybe you\u2019d have changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Dan ducks into a doorway, lighting the end of his cigarette. They\u2019re thin and black, these weird cherry flavoured ones, which is undeniably fitting to his aesthetic and mood. \u201cAnd pass up three bags of Skittles? No way.\u201d</p><p>He inhales, then continues walking, Phil still trudging along at his side. \u201cSo, I can come over, then?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re literally following me home right now. It\u2019s not like I have much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>Phil says nothing, but when Dan sneaks a glance at his expression, misted from the rain, he\u2019s smiling. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>The whisper filters through the filmy layer of Dan\u2019s mind, hauling him out of the dream he was about to slip into.</p><p>\u201cDan, are you awake?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice sounds strange.</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Dan says, stirring. \u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>He opens his eyes crossly, irritated at being woken from what was sure to be a lovely, long sleep. The first thing he notices, even in the pitch black, is that Phil is very close to him. They\u2019re sharing Dan\u2019s single bed, so obviously their proximity is a little more than normal, but he\u2019s shifted towards Dan\u2019s side significantly.</p><p>Dan tries to put some distance back between them, but he\u2019s got the wall behind him. He gives up, mind swirling in an attempt to distract himself from the fact that Phil is wearing his old Muse t-shirt and boxers, and is pressed almost against him, in his bed. Only hours ago, they\u2019d been making out on a table in a closed cafe. Dan no longer feels very sleepy. Phil is staring straight at him, across the pillow. He\u2019s chewing his lip, a worried crease between his brows.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s the matter?\u201d Dan asks sleepily. His heart races. \u201cDid you hear Ricky come home?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, and Dan\u2019s lets out a quiet sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier,\u201d Phil says quietly; Dan really wishes he hadn\u2019t said it at all. \u201cThe kiss, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs a shoulder. \u201cS\u2019okay.\u201d</p><p>It isn\u2019t, though. It\u2019s far from okay, it\u2019s made everything a hell of a lot worse, but Phil doesn\u2019t know about Dan\u2019s feelings, so it\u2019s not all his fault. Phil\u2019s hand slides onto his hip. It\u2019s warm, and gripping a little too tightly to be normal. Dan stares at him, entirely lost on what\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like cherries again,\u201d Phil tells him, so quiet it\u2019s barely audible. \u201cYou taste like cherries, too.\u201d </p><p>Dan has no idea what to say, but it turns out he needn\u2019t bother. Phil shifts closer still, that hand on his hip gripping tighter, and then their lips are pressed together. Phil is purposeful, searching, kissing Dan with the same unexpected intensity that he had back in the caf\u00e9. For a fleeting second, Dan is able to hold onto his resistance. He remains rigid, certain that this is a mistake, that Phil is not in his right mind, and that he should not give in to it. But Phil is stubborn, he is patient, and desperate. The hand on his hip feels like a plea, and Dan could never resist Phil\u2019s begging. So he gives in, falls into the welcome warmth of Phil\u2019s wave of wanting. He kisses Phil like he\u2019s starving, not concerned with breaking away this time because he initiated it, there are no \u2018kissing lessons\u2019 to disguise it. This is unprecedented, unprovoked, and entirely Phil\u2019s decision.</p><p>The hand on Dan\u2019s hip slips round to grab at his bum, mostly to pull their bodies closer together. Dan gasps, allowing his limp, exhausted body to mould itself around Phil\u2019s chest and legs. He imagines the clothes gone, the warm, smooth skin of him beneath, and groans. He winds his hands into Phil\u2019s t-shirt, feeling the heady arousal sweep from his lips, down his chest, and between his legs, leaving a flush in its wake. </p><p>Phil\u2019s hand works its way between them, finding the telltale bump of Dan\u2019s erection and pressing against it. Dan gasps, pulling back from the kiss to look into Phil\u2019s eyes. He should say something, make sure Phil is really sure he wants to do this, but the words die with a firm push of Phil\u2019s fingers. He rubs against Dan in soft, gentle movements, still above his boxers. It\u2019s too teasing to be enough, but Dan shuts his eyes anyway, choking back a moan of bliss. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d Phil asks, his voice quiet and husky.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes fly open, and he shakes his head. Phil doesn\u2019t seem to need any further confirmation. He dips his hand into the waistband of Dan\u2019s boxers, curling his fingers around the length of him. Dan chokes on something \u2013 the air, maybe \u2013 thrown by the confidence with which Phil moves considering this is, as far as Dan knows, his first time doing anything like this.</p><p>Dan\u2019s never been particularly vocal in bed unless asked, so he just buries his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder, whimpering as Phil\u2019s hand pumps a steady rhythm around him, gradually becoming slicker, messier as the build of his orgasm drags over Dan\u2019s body. Phil\u2019s movements are unpracticed, his hand is at an awkward angle, and he hasn\u2019t even pulled Dan\u2019s boxers down, but somehow it\u2019s beyond incredible.</p><p>Dan comes hard, unable to stop himself crying out as Phil sinks his teeth into the exposed skin of his neck, sucking a mark there. He shudders as the pleasure ebbs away, going limp in Phil\u2019s arms. Phil pulls his hand out from Dan\u2019s boxers, wiping it on the Muse logo. A few seconds of stunned silence pass in the wake of what just occurred, and then Dan moves, jumping to attention like a soldier going about his routine. He pushes his lips back into Phil\u2019s, just as hungry as before, and slides a hand down his torso, from collarbone to groin.</p><p>Phil catches hold of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Phil says hurriedly. Through the Muse t-shirt, Dan can feel his heart pounding.</p><p>He stares at Phil, confused. \u201cLet me\u2026 help you out.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles at him, though it seems a bit strained. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. Let\u2019s just go to sleep, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Dan scans his face, trying to suss out why on earth somebody would refuse a return offer in this situation, but he comes up short. Hey, maybe Phil is just a little strange. Maybe his first time nerves kicked in a little later than expected.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Dan asks. His tongue flicks out to play with his lip ring, flirtatious. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, you know.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s gaze hones in on the lip ring, and he swallows thickly. \u201cY-yeah, really. I\u2019m just tired. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Dan shuffles down, getting comfy again. It\u2019s difficult, because he\u2019d ideally like a shower right now, preferably one with Phil, but it\u2019s obviously not going to happen, so Dan\u2019s gonna just have to suck it up. But not literally, apparently.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says after some thought. He shuffles closer to Phil, a warm and hopeful glow pulsating in his gut for the first time in years. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long time before Phil replies.</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178893484577/edgelorddan-x-obliviousbisexualphil-au-chapter\">Chapter Seven!</a>)</b></p>",

He has seemed perfectly content all evening, sat at a table for two in the corner by the window, drawing in his sketchpad. He\u2019s ordered at least three coffees, which he\u2019ll probably regret once he gets home and can\u2019t sleep, but Dan isn\u2019t going to lecture him again. The last customer left around twenty minutes ago, and Phil is still there, frowning down at whatever he\u2019s sketching. Dan has just finished counting up, so he walks over to Phil\u2019s table to collect the mug he\u2019s been drinking from.</p><p>\u201cYou planning on sleeping here?\u201d He asks, picking up the mug and saucer.</p><p>Phil looks up at him in surprise. \u201cOh, hey let me take that.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts at him. \u201cIt\u2019s literally my job, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Dan walks away then, shaking his head fondly at Phil\u2019s owlish protestations.</p><p>\u201cAm I slowing you down?\u201d Phil calls as Dan heads into the kitchen. \u201cI can go if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan calls back, rinsing the crockery before stacking it into the dishwasher. \u201cJust don\u2019t make a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of creepy here after hours,\u201d Phil says as Dan walks back out. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it all on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on my own,\u201d Dan counters.</p><p>There\u2019s a hesitance on Phil\u2019s face when Dan glances at him. \u201cYou think I\u2019m nuts, don\u2019t you? For going through with the date.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks away, busying himself with stacking chairs. The scraping of the legs on the tiled floor makes him wince. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly brave.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts. \u201cBrave. Because you think it\u2019s a joke. That she doesn\u2019t actually like me, and that she\u2019s doing it to get back at Hardy.\u201d</p><p>A chair clatters from Dan\u2019s hands, and he curses. Instead of picking it back up, he turns to Phil. \u201cIt might have crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s what everyone thinks,\u201d Phil says, shrugging. \u201cThat she\u2019s just using me. I get it. It\u2019s ridiculous to think she\u2019d actually consider me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with you, Phil,\u201d Dan says quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s just how they are in the Elite. They don\u2019t think about the feelings of people like us. The only time they even acknowledge us is if we can benefit their lives in some way. Getting them coffee. Giving them lifts home. Making their boyfriend\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Phil says dismissively, frowning in an uncharacteristic way. \u201cI\u2019m still gonna go through with it.\u201d</p><p>Getting through to Phil is like trying to get through to the floor beneath his feet. </p><p>\u201cEven if you know for sure that she\u2019s stringing you along?\u201d Dan asks, barely disguising his frustration. \u201cPhil, that\u2019s suicidal. If she\u2019s purposefully dangling you in front of Hardy Jenns you\u2019re gonna get your ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s her intention going in, that\u2019s her problem. I\u2019m gonna change her mind by the time the date is over,\u201d Phil says confidently. </p><p>\u201cOkay, now I do think you\u2019re nuts,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He begins stacking the chairs again, loudly and with a recklessness that he wouldn\u2019t normally. He should drop this, change the subject or something. But the irritation is overwhelming. Phil can\u2019t see two feet under his nose. He\u2019s being stubborn, because he feels he has to prove he can go through with this now, even though every star in the sky is screaming at him to turn back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a lot, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can see that,\u201d Dan says, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Phil insists. \u00a0I think I can make her see that it\u2019s better to be in the real world with the rest of us, rather than up in the clouds of the Elite. That she\u2019d be happier without all the drama and the materialism and the seedy guys.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cHow\u2019re you gonna show her that, exactly? What\u2019ve you got to offer her apart from a paintbrush and some overpriced jewellery? I mean, have you even properly kissed a girl?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mean it to come out so harshly, but he\u2019s angry, and his tongue doesn\u2019t listen to him when he gets into a state. He shuts his eyes, placing the chair in his hands down.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says bitterly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right,\u201d Phil interrupts. He stands slowly from his chair and lifts it onto the table. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever kissed one person. It\u2019s been worrying me a little, actually.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares at him through the legs of several chairs, trying to think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cYou think Amanda would notice something like that?\u201d Phil asks, meeting Dan\u2019s eye. His raw, genuine concern is so obvious in his expression that Dan has to tear his gaze away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He can\u2019t stop himself saying it, because it\u2019s the truth. \u201cAmanda Jones isn\u2019t likely to be fooled by an amateur kiss, if you ask me. That babe\u2019s got plenty of battle scars.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolls his eyes at the wording, but catches hold of his lower lip between his teeth, worrying it to and fro. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods slowly, leaning against an unstacked table for some support. Something about this conversation feels dangerous. Dan can feel his heart racing, his palms growing damp. He swallows thickly, mouth suddenly dry. </p><p>\u201cWell, if you think you can deliver a kiss that kills, you probably can,\u201d Dan says, one shoulder shrugging. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil says hurriedly, taking a step towards him. \u201cI\u2019m no expert.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares at him.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s all about, like,\u201d Dan flounders, feeling himself grow red. \u201cConfidence.\u201d</p><p>Phil ducks his chin towards his chest, then peers up at Dan, eyes sparkling with mischief. Before Dan can react, Phil\u2019s closing the short distance between them in three long strides, pushing him up against the table behind him. Dan\u2019s lungs seize up, but manages to gather himself enough to prevent himself from squealing at the unexpected attack.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Phil asks. </p><p>He\u2019s smirking like it\u2019s a stupid joke, but Dan\u2019s breaths are still getting stuck in his throat. Dan rolls his eyes, but there\u2019s no way Phil can\u2019t hear the hammering of his heart. </p><p>\u201cYeah, just ram her up against the table,\u201d Dan says, ever the sarcastic bitch. \u201cShe definitely won\u2019t find that creepy.\u201d</p><p>Phil snickers. \u201cYou seem to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>Instead of obeying Dan\u2019s command, Phil seizes hold of him by the thighs and lifts him deftly onto the tabletop, slotting himself between Dan\u2019s legs. At this point, Dan is sure he\u2019ll combust, so he focuses all of his attention on the tasks he has left to do before locking up tonight. <i>Mop the floor in the kitchen, put the float into the safe, kick Phil in the balls for being such a fucking tease\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cSo, what next?\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, Dan glares at him, struggling to break free of Phil\u2019s hold. \u201cForget it, I did not sign up to be your snogging tutor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m literally begging,\u201d Phil says, letting slip a sudden flash of the insecurity lurking beneath his flirtatious demeanour. \u201cI just need to know if I suck. I just need to be <i>passable</i>. You can help me, I know you can.\u201d</p><p>Dan is far, far too soft, he thinks, melting immediately, of course. Any resistance he may once have had was dissolved a few nights ago, in Phil\u2019s bed, when the realisation of his own feelings for the man avalanched down upon him. He\u2019s been trapped underneath the debris of that revelation ever since, struggling to breathe, aching and tortured, awaiting rescue that won\u2019t come. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d Dan says, as if it\u2019s some huge inconvenience. </p><p>Phil\u2019s hands release Dan\u2019s thighs, clapping together in glee. \u201cThank you, Dan. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, your debt to me is higher than all of England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, so what do I do now?\u201d</p><p>Dan struggles to focus, but catches sight of Phil\u2019s frantically fidgeting hands. He can start with that, at least. \u201cWhat are you gonna do with your hands?\u201d</p><p>Phil blinks at him, confused. \u201cUh, it- it depends-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan tells him firmly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t depend. They go on my- on her hips.\u201d He blushes, waiting for this to register, but Phil just stares. \u00a0\u201cDo it, you pleb.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles nervously, but reaches out to place his hands on Dan\u2019s hips. They\u2019re just resting there, light as anything, but the touch of him, light and warm, still makes Dan want to cry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cShe\u2019ll um- she\u2019ll probably do this.\u201d</p><p>Dan stretches his own arms out, reaching up until he\u2019s got them locked around Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019d do?\u201d Phil asks, his voice sounding strange and thin. \u201cIf I were- if it were you being kissed?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs, disliking the question. \u201cProb\u2019ly.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, drinking down the information like it\u2019s gold. \u201cOkay, what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, close your eyes,\u201d Dan instructs, and Phil does. He\u2019s so passively beautiful. All pale skin and dark lashes. Dan is not in any way ready for what\u2019s about to happen here. How the fuck did he get himself into this situation? \u201cNow, lean in really close to me, but\u2026 don\u2019t touch me yet.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no denying that at this point, self indulgence has come into play. Dan can\u2019t bring himself to feel too bad about it. He\u2019s never going to get an opportunity like this again, and in all likelihood Phil\u2019s too clueless to cotton on to whether Dan might be a little biased in his instruction. Phil closes some of the distance between them, their lips close now; Dan tightens his lock around Phil\u2019s neck. He smells like the caramel macchiatos Dan\u2019s been making for him all evening.</p><p>He lets Phil wait for it. In Dan\u2019s opinion, the best part about a kiss is the build up. It\u2019s the space between them, humming with an electric yearning. It\u2019s the eyes darting to one another\u2019s mouths, and the slow, careful dance around the minefield of wrong moves as they work up to it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan whispers, knowing his breath will sizzle against Phil\u2019s lips. He feels Phil shiver, and it makes his stomach flip. \u201cNow, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Phil does as told. He seems a little stunned to see Dan up so close.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, their noses brushing. \u201cTell her something.\u201d</p><p>Phil frowns. \u201cTell her what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d Dan near-whispers. For some reason, his eyes sting. He focuses them on Phil\u2019s tongue as it sweeps over his lower lip. \u201cTell her she\u2019s got pretty eyes, or she\u2019s a hot babe. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling her she\u2019s a hot babe,\u201d Phil says, rolling his eyes. He seems a little pink-cheeked, though. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not telling you you\u2019re a hot babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me something else, then,\u201d Dan says before he can stop himself. \u201cI mean, pretend I\u2019m her. <i>Amanda</i>. And tell me what you want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend you\u2019re her?\u201d Phil asks, eyes roving over Dan\u2019s face as though it\u2019s an impossible feat.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a stretch Phil, but try it.\u201d</p><p>Phil is silent, his lips pressing together as he surveys Dan, still so close that he\u2019s probably all blurry in Phil\u2019s vision anyway. Eventually, Dan kicks him.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he prompts, heart stuttering already. </p><p>His palms have gone past clammy into damp; he feels a bit dizzy, from the coffees he\u2019s been drinking, and the cigarette he hasn\u2019t had yet. This is something from his wildest, most surreal dreams, something he honestly never thought would happen, and here it is, right in front of him. He blinks, but it doesn\u2019t go away. Phil is still so irresistibly close, the blue around his eyes thinned to a sliver, his heartbeat loud enough to hear. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing\u2026\u201d Phil starts to say, his voice slow and quiet. \u201cI have ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s breath catches, and he feels his eyes sting again. He nods. \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cNow kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes widen, but he leans forwards readily. Dan\u2019s breath hitches again, and he finds himself drawing back a little.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says hurriedly. He fixes Phil with a hard stare, trying to appear as unaffected as possible. \u201cIf you stick your tongue in my mouth, I will bite it off, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, looking a little relieved, and nods. Then, the hands on his hips yank him forwards, and Dan is being kissed. Slowly at first, tentative and unsure, but then harder, hungrier, as though some levee inside of Phil has broken. His hands tighten on Dan\u2019s hips, fingers pushing into Dan\u2019s skin, so hard it could bruise.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips drag Dan\u2019s apart; he flicks his tongue against Dan\u2019s lip ring, then pushes it into Dan\u2019s mouth, breaking the one, singular rule Dan had given him, but he finds he doesn\u2019t even care. He never meant it anyway. He likes tongue. He would give anything not to know the taste of Phil\u2019s, but only because he\u2019ll never know it again. </p><p>He tastes like coffee, and caramel, and the bitter lead of his pencil when he licks the tip. Dan whimpers as these flavours unfurl across his taste buds; he pulls himself closer to Phil by the vice grip he has around his neck.</p><p>They kiss for what feels like hours, but it still isn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s a sudden vibration against his thigh, from what must be the phone in Phil\u2019s pocket. Like a shock of icy water thrown in his face, he remembers the time. He remembers the day, his own name, his tragedy of a life, and more importantly, who Phil is thinking about right now.</p><p>Somehow, along with the surge of disgust for himself that rises like bile in his throat, Dan manages to summon the strength to unwind his arms from Phil\u2019s neck and shove, hard, against his chest. Phil stumbles backwards, shocked, his lips wet and reddened. There\u2019s an indent in their corner from where Dan\u2019s lip ring has pressed into his flesh, and the sight of it is making Dan want to throw up.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, Phil,\u201d Dan pants, staring at him. Phil just stares, stunned, breathing heavily. \u201cYou don\u2019t need lessons, okay? You\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, hands braced against the table as he tries to gain some control. How did he just let that happen? He is so, so fucked.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil says at last. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what- you\u2019re just so, um, pretty, and it was all nice and familiar- I guess I just\u2026 I got carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarried away,\u201d Dan repeats with a humourless laugh, still breathless. \u201cJust a little.\u201d</p><p>Phil ducks his head, his cheeks a little flushed. \u201cThanks, though. For helping me.\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head, barely able to believe his ears. He feels a rush of hot, stinging anger flooding his veins, and he glares at Phil, unable to suppress it.</p><p>\u201cSure. What else am I here for, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the only thing I\u2019m good for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dan spits out. He stands from the table on jelly legs, untying his apron and yanking it off. \u201cAs the town whore, you might as well use me for practise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, what- that is not why I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Dan growls, stalking past Phil towards the kitchen.</p><p>He pushes through the door, trying to ignore that his throat feels like he\u2019s swallowed a lump of burning hot coal.\t</p><p>\u201cDan, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Phil calls from the caf\u00e9 floor. Dan leans his head back against the kitchen door separating them, shutting his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, I just- fuck. Please don\u2019t be annoyed.\u201d</p><p>Dan bites down hard on his lip, hating that he can still taste Phil there, all sickly sweet syrup and a rich, malty aftertaste.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Phil calls out again. \u201cPlease talk to me.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a push from the other side of the door, jolting Dan forwards. He moves out of its path, letting Phil swing it open. He stands in the doorway, looking shame-faced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan sighs, running a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2026 happened. Let\u2019s just move the fuck on.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, still a little dazed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, brushing past him as he goes to finish closing up the caf\u00e9. Phil just watches him perform the medial little tasks that need doing with a glazed expression, looking like a lost child.<br>Dan is about a hundred percent sure he missed something on his to-do list by the time he gets his jacket, but he can\u2019t be bothered to check. Louise can yell at him, he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Dan says to Phil, his voice gruff still.</p><p>He walks to the door, jingling the keys, and opens it for Phil to step out into the dark street. Dan switches all the lights off without looking back, and follows him outside to lock the doors.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d Phil says, as if Dan hadn\u2019t noticed the moisture pelting him from above.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d Dan replies, turning the final lock.</p><p>\u201cCan I come over?\u201d</p><p>Dan freezes, trying not to react. He turns to Phil slowly, a frown creasing his brow. \u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Phil cocks his head like a spaniel. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Dan purses his lips, looking up at the rainclouds, invisible in the dark. \u201cSeveral reasons.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mention that one of them is that he needs some time to privately flip the memory of Phil kissing him over and over in his mad, analytical brain until it\u2019s wrung dry. He can already tell that that moment in time will forever be etched into his brain, just like his hips will always feel the ghost of Phil\u2019s grip, and his lips\u2026 well. No other kiss will ever again mean anything, Dan is sure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Prom tomorrow,\u201d Phil says, his voice small. Dan rolls his eyes, wondering if Phil really thinks he could have forgotten when it\u2019s literally all they\u2019ve talked about for weeks. \u201cYou\u2019re still gonna drive us, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs, desperately wishing he had enough spine to refuse right now. \u201cSaid I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He stuffs the keys into his pocket, flicks up the hood of his jacket and starts walking down the street. Phil follows at his side, hands stuffed into the pocket of his hoodie. Silvery puffs of air escape from his mouth as he breathes; suddenly, Dan remembers his vice, digging into his back pocket. The packet\u2019s a little damp, but he pulls a cigarette out with his teeth, uncaring.</p><p>\u201cI just thought maybe you\u2019d have changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Dan ducks into a doorway, lighting the end of his cigarette. They\u2019re thin and black, these weird cherry flavoured ones, which is undeniably fitting to his aesthetic and mood. \u201cAnd pass up three bags of Skittles? No way.\u201d</p><p>He inhales, then continues walking, Phil still trudging along at his side. \u201cSo, I can come over, then?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re literally following me home right now. It\u2019s not like I have much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>Phil says nothing, but when Dan sneaks a glance at his expression, misted from the rain, he\u2019s smiling. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>The whisper filters through the filmy layer of Dan\u2019s mind, hauling him out of the dream he was about to slip into.</p><p>\u201cDan, are you awake?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice sounds strange.</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Dan says, stirring. \u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>He opens his eyes crossly, irritated at being woken from what was sure to be a lovely, long sleep. The first thing he notices, even in the pitch black, is that Phil is very close to him. They\u2019re sharing Dan\u2019s single bed, so obviously their proximity is a little more than normal, but he\u2019s shifted towards Dan\u2019s side significantly.</p><p>Dan tries to put some distance back between them, but he\u2019s got the wall behind him. He gives up, mind swirling in an attempt to distract himself from the fact that Phil is wearing his old Muse t-shirt and boxers, and is pressed almost against him, in his bed. Only hours ago, they\u2019d been making out on a table in a closed cafe. Dan no longer feels very sleepy. Phil is staring straight at him, across the pillow. He\u2019s chewing his lip, a worried crease between his brows.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s the matter?\u201d Dan asks sleepily. His heart races. \u201cDid you hear Ricky come home?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, and Dan\u2019s lets out a quiet sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier,\u201d Phil says quietly; Dan really wishes he hadn\u2019t said it at all. \u201cThe kiss, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs a shoulder. \u201cS\u2019okay.\u201d</p><p>It isn\u2019t, though. It\u2019s far from okay, it\u2019s made everything a hell of a lot worse, but Phil doesn\u2019t know about Dan\u2019s feelings, so it\u2019s not all his fault. Phil\u2019s hand slides onto his hip. It\u2019s warm, and gripping a little too tightly to be normal. Dan stares at him, entirely lost on what\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like cherries again,\u201d Phil tells him, so quiet it\u2019s barely audible. \u201cYou taste like cherries, too.\u201d </p><p>Dan has no idea what to say, but it turns out he needn\u2019t bother. Phil shifts closer still, that hand on his hip gripping tighter, and then their lips are pressed together. Phil is purposeful, searching, kissing Dan with the same unexpected intensity that he had back in the caf\u00e9. For a fleeting second, Dan is able to hold onto his resistance. He remains rigid, certain that this is a mistake, that Phil is not in his right mind, and that he should not give in to it. But Phil is stubborn, he is patient, and desperate. The hand on his hip feels like a plea, and Dan could never resist Phil\u2019s begging. So he gives in, falls into the welcome warmth of Phil\u2019s wave of wanting. He kisses Phil like he\u2019s starving, not concerned with breaking away this time because he initiated it, there are no \u2018kissing lessons\u2019 to disguise it. This is unprecedented, unprovoked, and entirely Phil\u2019s decision.</p><p>The hand on Dan\u2019s hip slips round to grab at his bum, mostly to pull their bodies closer together. Dan gasps, allowing his limp, exhausted body to mould itself around Phil\u2019s chest and legs. He imagines the clothes gone, the warm, smooth skin of him beneath, and groans. He winds his hands into Phil\u2019s t-shirt, feeling the heady arousal sweep from his lips, down his chest, and between his legs, leaving a flush in its wake. </p><p>Phil\u2019s hand works its way between them, finding the telltale bump of Dan\u2019s erection and pressing against it. Dan gasps, pulling back from the kiss to look into Phil\u2019s eyes. He should say something, make sure Phil is really sure he wants to do this, but the words die with a firm push of Phil\u2019s fingers. He rubs against Dan in soft, gentle movements, still above his boxers. It\u2019s too teasing to be enough, but Dan shuts his eyes anyway, choking back a moan of bliss. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d Phil asks, his voice quiet and husky.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes fly open, and he shakes his head. Phil doesn\u2019t seem to need any further confirmation. He dips his hand into the waistband of Dan\u2019s boxers, curling his fingers around the length of him. Dan chokes on something \u2013 the air, maybe \u2013 thrown by the confidence with which Phil moves considering this is, as far as Dan knows, his first time doing anything like this.</p><p>Dan\u2019s never been particularly vocal in bed unless asked, so he just buries his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder, whimpering as Phil\u2019s hand pumps a steady rhythm around him, gradually becoming slicker, messier as the build of his orgasm drags over Dan\u2019s body. Phil\u2019s movements are unpracticed, his hand is at an awkward angle, and he hasn\u2019t even pulled Dan\u2019s boxers down, but somehow it\u2019s beyond incredible.</p><p>Dan comes hard, unable to stop himself crying out as Phil sinks his teeth into the exposed skin of his neck, sucking a mark there. He shudders as the pleasure ebbs away, going limp in Phil\u2019s arms. Phil pulls his hand out from Dan\u2019s boxers, wiping it on the Muse logo. A few seconds of stunned silence pass in the wake of what just occurred, and then Dan moves, jumping to attention like a soldier going about his routine. He pushes his lips back into Phil\u2019s, just as hungry as before, and slides a hand down his torso, from collarbone to groin.</p><p>Phil catches hold of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Phil says hurriedly. Through the Muse t-shirt, Dan can feel his heart pounding.</p><p>He stares at Phil, confused. \u201cLet me\u2026 help you out.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles at him, though it seems a bit strained. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. Let\u2019s just go to sleep, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Dan scans his face, trying to suss out why on earth somebody would refuse a return offer in this situation, but he comes up short. Hey, maybe Phil is just a little strange. Maybe his first time nerves kicked in a little later than expected.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Dan asks. His tongue flicks out to play with his lip ring, flirtatious. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, you know.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s gaze hones in on the lip ring, and he swallows thickly. \u201cY-yeah, really. I\u2019m just tired. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Dan shuffles down, getting comfy again. It\u2019s difficult, because he\u2019d ideally like a shower right now, preferably one with Phil, but it\u2019s obviously not going to happen, so Dan\u2019s gonna just have to suck it up. But not literally, apparently.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says after some thought. He shuffles closer to Phil, a warm and hopeful glow pulsating in his gut for the first time in years. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long time before Phil replies.</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178893484577/edgelorddan-x-obliviousbisexualphil-au-chapter\">Chapter Seven!</a>)</b></p>",

He hates having to clean the entire coffee machine inside and out. He hates the pressure of counting the money in the till, especially as he sucks at maths.</p><p>He hates having to wipe down every table and surface. He hates having to restock the milk in the fridge and the sugar on the counter. He loathes having to switch off every single light one by one, letting the shadows crawl out of their corners and smother the place. He usually does this final task at the last possible moment, so that he can just walk straight to the door and leave as soon as possible. The caf\u00e9, which is quite a sweet, pretty place with a soft, happy feel in the daytime, becomes something evil in the dark.</p><p>Tonight however, it\u2019s not so bad. The late shift is given to Dan at least once a week, because he\u2019s worked here a lot longer than most of the other staff, and so can be trusted. He\u2019s done it so many times that he could do it blindfolded, he\u2019s sure, so Louise allows him to do it on his own.</p><p>Tonight, he\u2019s not on his own.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Phil walked to work with him today, and has stayed ever since. He has seemed perfectly content all evening, sat at a table for two in the corner by the window, drawing in his sketchpad. He\u2019s ordered at least three coffees, which he\u2019ll probably regret once he gets home and can\u2019t sleep, but Dan isn\u2019t going to lecture him again. The last customer left around twenty minutes ago, and Phil is still there, frowning down at whatever he\u2019s sketching. Dan has just finished counting up, so he walks over to Phil\u2019s table to collect the mug he\u2019s been drinking from.</p><p>\u201cYou planning on sleeping here?\u201d He asks, picking up the mug and saucer.</p><p>Phil looks up at him in surprise. \u201cOh, hey let me take that.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts at him. \u201cIt\u2019s literally my job, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Dan walks away then, shaking his head fondly at Phil\u2019s owlish protestations.</p><p>\u201cAm I slowing you down?\u201d Phil calls as Dan heads into the kitchen. \u201cI can go if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan calls back, rinsing the crockery before stacking it into the dishwasher. \u201cJust don\u2019t make a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of creepy here after hours,\u201d Phil says as Dan walks back out. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it all on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on my own,\u201d Dan counters.</p><p>There\u2019s a hesitance on Phil\u2019s face when Dan glances at him. \u201cYou think I\u2019m nuts, don\u2019t you? For going through with the date.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks away, busying himself with stacking chairs. The scraping of the legs on the tiled floor makes him wince. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly brave.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorts. \u201cBrave. Because you think it\u2019s a joke. That she doesn\u2019t actually like me, and that she\u2019s doing it to get back at Hardy.\u201d</p><p>A chair clatters from Dan\u2019s hands, and he curses. Instead of picking it back up, he turns to Phil. \u201cIt might have crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s what everyone thinks,\u201d Phil says, shrugging. \u201cThat she\u2019s just using me. I get it. It\u2019s ridiculous to think she\u2019d actually consider me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with you, Phil,\u201d Dan says quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s just how they are in the Elite. They don\u2019t think about the feelings of people like us. The only time they even acknowledge us is if we can benefit their lives in some way. Getting them coffee. Giving them lifts home. Making their boyfriend\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Phil says dismissively, frowning in an uncharacteristic way. \u201cI\u2019m still gonna go through with it.\u201d</p><p>Getting through to Phil is like trying to get through to the floor beneath his feet. </p><p>\u201cEven if you know for sure that she\u2019s stringing you along?\u201d Dan asks, barely disguising his frustration. \u201cPhil, that\u2019s suicidal. If she\u2019s purposefully dangling you in front of Hardy Jenns you\u2019re gonna get your ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s her intention going in, that\u2019s her problem. I\u2019m gonna change her mind by the time the date is over,\u201d Phil says confidently. </p><p>\u201cOkay, now I do think you\u2019re nuts,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He begins stacking the chairs again, loudly and with a recklessness that he wouldn\u2019t normally. He should drop this, change the subject or something. But the irritation is overwhelming. Phil can\u2019t see two feet under his nose. He\u2019s being stubborn, because he feels he has to prove he can go through with this now, even though every star in the sky is screaming at him to turn back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a lot, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can see that,\u201d Dan says, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Phil insists. \u00a0I think I can make her see that it\u2019s better to be in the real world with the rest of us, rather than up in the clouds of the Elite. That she\u2019d be happier without all the drama and the materialism and the seedy guys.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cHow\u2019re you gonna show her that, exactly? What\u2019ve you got to offer her apart from a paintbrush and some overpriced jewellery? I mean, have you even properly kissed a girl?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mean it to come out so harshly, but he\u2019s angry, and his tongue doesn\u2019t listen to him when he gets into a state. He shuts his eyes, placing the chair in his hands down.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says bitterly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right,\u201d Phil interrupts. He stands slowly from his chair and lifts it onto the table. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever kissed one person. It\u2019s been worrying me a little, actually.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares at him through the legs of several chairs, trying to think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cYou think Amanda would notice something like that?\u201d Phil asks, meeting Dan\u2019s eye. His raw, genuine concern is so obvious in his expression that Dan has to tear his gaze away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He can\u2019t stop himself saying it, because it\u2019s the truth. \u201cAmanda Jones isn\u2019t likely to be fooled by an amateur kiss, if you ask me. That babe\u2019s got plenty of battle scars.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolls his eyes at the wording, but catches hold of his lower lip between his teeth, worrying it to and fro. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods slowly, leaning against an unstacked table for some support. Something about this conversation feels dangerous. Dan can feel his heart racing, his palms growing damp. He swallows thickly, mouth suddenly dry. </p><p>\u201cWell, if you think you can deliver a kiss that kills, you probably can,\u201d Dan says, one shoulder shrugging. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil says hurriedly, taking a step towards him. \u201cI\u2019m no expert.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares at him.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s all about, like,\u201d Dan flounders, feeling himself grow red. \u201cConfidence.\u201d</p><p>Phil ducks his chin towards his chest, then peers up at Dan, eyes sparkling with mischief. Before Dan can react, Phil\u2019s closing the short distance between them in three long strides, pushing him up against the table behind him. Dan\u2019s lungs seize up, but manages to gather himself enough to prevent himself from squealing at the unexpected attack.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Phil asks. </p><p>He\u2019s smirking like it\u2019s a stupid joke, but Dan\u2019s breaths are still getting stuck in his throat. Dan rolls his eyes, but there\u2019s no way Phil can\u2019t hear the hammering of his heart. </p><p>\u201cYeah, just ram her up against the table,\u201d Dan says, ever the sarcastic bitch. \u201cShe definitely won\u2019t find that creepy.\u201d</p><p>Phil snickers. \u201cYou seem to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>Instead of obeying Dan\u2019s command, Phil seizes hold of him by the thighs and lifts him deftly onto the tabletop, slotting himself between Dan\u2019s legs. At this point, Dan is sure he\u2019ll combust, so he focuses all of his attention on the tasks he has left to do before locking up tonight. <i>Mop the floor in the kitchen, put the float into the safe, kick Phil in the balls for being such a fucking tease\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cSo, what next?\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, Dan glares at him, struggling to break free of Phil\u2019s hold. \u201cForget it, I did not sign up to be your snogging tutor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m literally begging,\u201d Phil says, letting slip a sudden flash of the insecurity lurking beneath his flirtatious demeanour. \u201cI just need to know if I suck. I just need to be <i>passable</i>. You can help me, I know you can.\u201d</p><p>Dan is far, far too soft, he thinks, melting immediately, of course. Any resistance he may once have had was dissolved a few nights ago, in Phil\u2019s bed, when the realisation of his own feelings for the man avalanched down upon him. He\u2019s been trapped underneath the debris of that revelation ever since, struggling to breathe, aching and tortured, awaiting rescue that won\u2019t come. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d Dan says, as if it\u2019s some huge inconvenience. </p><p>Phil\u2019s hands release Dan\u2019s thighs, clapping together in glee. \u201cThank you, Dan. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, your debt to me is higher than all of England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, so what do I do now?\u201d</p><p>Dan struggles to focus, but catches sight of Phil\u2019s frantically fidgeting hands. He can start with that, at least. \u201cWhat are you gonna do with your hands?\u201d</p><p>Phil blinks at him, confused. \u201cUh, it- it depends-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan tells him firmly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t depend. They go on my- on her hips.\u201d He blushes, waiting for this to register, but Phil just stares. \u00a0\u201cDo it, you pleb.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles nervously, but reaches out to place his hands on Dan\u2019s hips. They\u2019re just resting there, light as anything, but the touch of him, light and warm, still makes Dan want to cry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cShe\u2019ll um- she\u2019ll probably do this.\u201d</p><p>Dan stretches his own arms out, reaching up until he\u2019s got them locked around Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019d do?\u201d Phil asks, his voice sounding strange and thin. \u201cIf I were- if it were you being kissed?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs, disliking the question. \u201cProb\u2019ly.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, drinking down the information like it\u2019s gold. \u201cOkay, what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, close your eyes,\u201d Dan instructs, and Phil does. He\u2019s so passively beautiful. All pale skin and dark lashes. Dan is not in any way ready for what\u2019s about to happen here. How the fuck did he get himself into this situation? \u201cNow, lean in really close to me, but\u2026 don\u2019t touch me yet.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no denying that at this point, self indulgence has come into play. Dan can\u2019t bring himself to feel too bad about it. He\u2019s never going to get an opportunity like this again, and in all likelihood Phil\u2019s too clueless to cotton on to whether Dan might be a little biased in his instruction. Phil closes some of the distance between them, their lips close now; Dan tightens his lock around Phil\u2019s neck. He smells like the caramel macchiatos Dan\u2019s been making for him all evening.</p><p>He lets Phil wait for it. In Dan\u2019s opinion, the best part about a kiss is the build up. It\u2019s the space between them, humming with an electric yearning. It\u2019s the eyes darting to one another\u2019s mouths, and the slow, careful dance around the minefield of wrong moves as they work up to it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan whispers, knowing his breath will sizzle against Phil\u2019s lips. He feels Phil shiver, and it makes his stomach flip. \u201cNow, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Phil does as told. He seems a little stunned to see Dan up so close.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, their noses brushing. \u201cTell her something.\u201d</p><p>Phil frowns. \u201cTell her what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d Dan near-whispers. For some reason, his eyes sting. He focuses them on Phil\u2019s tongue as it sweeps over his lower lip. \u201cTell her she\u2019s got pretty eyes, or she\u2019s a hot babe. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling her she\u2019s a hot babe,\u201d Phil says, rolling his eyes. He seems a little pink-cheeked, though. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not telling you you\u2019re a hot babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me something else, then,\u201d Dan says before he can stop himself. \u201cI mean, pretend I\u2019m her. <i>Amanda</i>. And tell me what you want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend you\u2019re her?\u201d Phil asks, eyes roving over Dan\u2019s face as though it\u2019s an impossible feat.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a stretch Phil, but try it.\u201d</p><p>Phil is silent, his lips pressing together as he surveys Dan, still so close that he\u2019s probably all blurry in Phil\u2019s vision anyway. Eventually, Dan kicks him.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he prompts, heart stuttering already. </p><p>His palms have gone past clammy into damp; he feels a bit dizzy, from the coffees he\u2019s been drinking, and the cigarette he hasn\u2019t had yet. This is something from his wildest, most surreal dreams, something he honestly never thought would happen, and here it is, right in front of him. He blinks, but it doesn\u2019t go away. Phil is still so irresistibly close, the blue around his eyes thinned to a sliver, his heartbeat loud enough to hear. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing\u2026\u201d Phil starts to say, his voice slow and quiet. \u201cI have ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s breath catches, and he feels his eyes sting again. He nods. \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cNow kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes widen, but he leans forwards readily. Dan\u2019s breath hitches again, and he finds himself drawing back a little.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says hurriedly. He fixes Phil with a hard stare, trying to appear as unaffected as possible. \u201cIf you stick your tongue in my mouth, I will bite it off, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Phil laughs, looking a little relieved, and nods. Then, the hands on his hips yank him forwards, and Dan is being kissed. Slowly at first, tentative and unsure, but then harder, hungrier, as though some levee inside of Phil has broken. His hands tighten on Dan\u2019s hips, fingers pushing into Dan\u2019s skin, so hard it could bruise.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips drag Dan\u2019s apart; he flicks his tongue against Dan\u2019s lip ring, then pushes it into Dan\u2019s mouth, breaking the one, singular rule Dan had given him, but he finds he doesn\u2019t even care. He never meant it anyway. He likes tongue. He would give anything not to know the taste of Phil\u2019s, but only because he\u2019ll never know it again. </p><p>He tastes like coffee, and caramel, and the bitter lead of his pencil when he licks the tip. Dan whimpers as these flavours unfurl across his taste buds; he pulls himself closer to Phil by the vice grip he has around his neck.</p><p>They kiss for what feels like hours, but it still isn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s a sudden vibration against his thigh, from what must be the phone in Phil\u2019s pocket. Like a shock of icy water thrown in his face, he remembers the time. He remembers the day, his own name, his tragedy of a life, and more importantly, who Phil is thinking about right now.</p><p>Somehow, along with the surge of disgust for himself that rises like bile in his throat, Dan manages to summon the strength to unwind his arms from Phil\u2019s neck and shove, hard, against his chest. Phil stumbles backwards, shocked, his lips wet and reddened. There\u2019s an indent in their corner from where Dan\u2019s lip ring has pressed into his flesh, and the sight of it is making Dan want to throw up.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, Phil,\u201d Dan pants, staring at him. Phil just stares, stunned, breathing heavily. \u201cYou don\u2019t need lessons, okay? You\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows, hands braced against the table as he tries to gain some control. How did he just let that happen? He is so, so fucked.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil says at last. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what- you\u2019re just so, um, pretty, and it was all nice and familiar- I guess I just\u2026 I got carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarried away,\u201d Dan repeats with a humourless laugh, still breathless. \u201cJust a little.\u201d</p><p>Phil ducks his head, his cheeks a little flushed. \u201cThanks, though. For helping me.\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head, barely able to believe his ears. He feels a rush of hot, stinging anger flooding his veins, and he glares at Phil, unable to suppress it.</p><p>\u201cSure. What else am I here for, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the only thing I\u2019m good for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dan spits out. He stands from the table on jelly legs, untying his apron and yanking it off. \u201cAs the town whore, you might as well use me for practise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, what- that is not why I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Dan growls, stalking past Phil towards the kitchen.</p><p>He pushes through the door, trying to ignore that his throat feels like he\u2019s swallowed a lump of burning hot coal.\t</p><p>\u201cDan, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Phil calls from the caf\u00e9 floor. Dan leans his head back against the kitchen door separating them, shutting his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, I just- fuck. Please don\u2019t be annoyed.\u201d</p><p>Dan bites down hard on his lip, hating that he can still taste Phil there, all sickly sweet syrup and a rich, malty aftertaste.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Phil calls out again. \u201cPlease talk to me.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a push from the other side of the door, jolting Dan forwards. He moves out of its path, letting Phil swing it open. He stands in the doorway, looking shame-faced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan sighs, running a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2026 happened. Let\u2019s just move the fuck on.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, still a little dazed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Dan nods, brushing past him as he goes to finish closing up the caf\u00e9. Phil just watches him perform the medial little tasks that need doing with a glazed expression, looking like a lost child.<br>Dan is about a hundred percent sure he missed something on his to-do list by the time he gets his jacket, but he can\u2019t be bothered to check. Louise can yell at him, he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Dan says to Phil, his voice gruff still.</p><p>He walks to the door, jingling the keys, and opens it for Phil to step out into the dark street. Dan switches all the lights off without looking back, and follows him outside to lock the doors.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d Phil says, as if Dan hadn\u2019t noticed the moisture pelting him from above.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d Dan replies, turning the final lock.</p><p>\u201cCan I come over?\u201d</p><p>Dan freezes, trying not to react. He turns to Phil slowly, a frown creasing his brow. \u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Phil cocks his head like a spaniel. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Dan purses his lips, looking up at the rainclouds, invisible in the dark. \u201cSeveral reasons.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mention that one of them is that he needs some time to privately flip the memory of Phil kissing him over and over in his mad, analytical brain until it\u2019s wrung dry. He can already tell that that moment in time will forever be etched into his brain, just like his hips will always feel the ghost of Phil\u2019s grip, and his lips\u2026 well. No other kiss will ever again mean anything, Dan is sure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Prom tomorrow,\u201d Phil says, his voice small. Dan rolls his eyes, wondering if Phil really thinks he could have forgotten when it\u2019s literally all they\u2019ve talked about for weeks. \u201cYou\u2019re still gonna drive us, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighs, desperately wishing he had enough spine to refuse right now. \u201cSaid I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He stuffs the keys into his pocket, flicks up the hood of his jacket and starts walking down the street. Phil follows at his side, hands stuffed into the pocket of his hoodie. Silvery puffs of air escape from his mouth as he breathes; suddenly, Dan remembers his vice, digging into his back pocket. The packet\u2019s a little damp, but he pulls a cigarette out with his teeth, uncaring.</p><p>\u201cI just thought maybe you\u2019d have changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Dan ducks into a doorway, lighting the end of his cigarette. They\u2019re thin and black, these weird cherry flavoured ones, which is undeniably fitting to his aesthetic and mood. \u201cAnd pass up three bags of Skittles? No way.\u201d</p><p>He inhales, then continues walking, Phil still trudging along at his side. \u201cSo, I can come over, then?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re literally following me home right now. It\u2019s not like I have much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>Phil says nothing, but when Dan sneaks a glance at his expression, misted from the rain, he\u2019s smiling. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>The whisper filters through the filmy layer of Dan\u2019s mind, hauling him out of the dream he was about to slip into.</p><p>\u201cDan, are you awake?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice sounds strange.</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Dan says, stirring. \u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>He opens his eyes crossly, irritated at being woken from what was sure to be a lovely, long sleep. The first thing he notices, even in the pitch black, is that Phil is very close to him. They\u2019re sharing Dan\u2019s single bed, so obviously their proximity is a little more than normal, but he\u2019s shifted towards Dan\u2019s side significantly.</p><p>Dan tries to put some distance back between them, but he\u2019s got the wall behind him. He gives up, mind swirling in an attempt to distract himself from the fact that Phil is wearing his old Muse t-shirt and boxers, and is pressed almost against him, in his bed. Only hours ago, they\u2019d been making out on a table in a closed cafe. Dan no longer feels very sleepy. Phil is staring straight at him, across the pillow. He\u2019s chewing his lip, a worried crease between his brows.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s the matter?\u201d Dan asks sleepily. His heart races. \u201cDid you hear Ricky come home?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, and Dan\u2019s lets out a quiet sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier,\u201d Phil says quietly; Dan really wishes he hadn\u2019t said it at all. \u201cThe kiss, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs a shoulder. \u201cS\u2019okay.\u201d</p><p>It isn\u2019t, though. It\u2019s far from okay, it\u2019s made everything a hell of a lot worse, but Phil doesn\u2019t know about Dan\u2019s feelings, so it\u2019s not all his fault. Phil\u2019s hand slides onto his hip. It\u2019s warm, and gripping a little too tightly to be normal. Dan stares at him, entirely lost on what\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like cherries again,\u201d Phil tells him, so quiet it\u2019s barely audible. \u201cYou taste like cherries, too.\u201d </p><p>Dan has no idea what to say, but it turns out he needn\u2019t bother. Phil shifts closer still, that hand on his hip gripping tighter, and then their lips are pressed together. Phil is purposeful, searching, kissing Dan with the same unexpected intensity that he had back in the caf\u00e9. For a fleeting second, Dan is able to hold onto his resistance. He remains rigid, certain that this is a mistake, that Phil is not in his right mind, and that he should not give in to it. But Phil is stubborn, he is patient, and desperate. The hand on his hip feels like a plea, and Dan could never resist Phil\u2019s begging. So he gives in, falls into the welcome warmth of Phil\u2019s wave of wanting. He kisses Phil like he\u2019s starving, not concerned with breaking away this time because he initiated it, there are no \u2018kissing lessons\u2019 to disguise it. This is unprecedented, unprovoked, and entirely Phil\u2019s decision.</p><p>The hand on Dan\u2019s hip slips round to grab at his bum, mostly to pull their bodies closer together. Dan gasps, allowing his limp, exhausted body to mould itself around Phil\u2019s chest and legs. He imagines the clothes gone, the warm, smooth skin of him beneath, and groans. He winds his hands into Phil\u2019s t-shirt, feeling the heady arousal sweep from his lips, down his chest, and between his legs, leaving a flush in its wake. </p><p>Phil\u2019s hand works its way between them, finding the telltale bump of Dan\u2019s erection and pressing against it. Dan gasps, pulling back from the kiss to look into Phil\u2019s eyes. He should say something, make sure Phil is really sure he wants to do this, but the words die with a firm push of Phil\u2019s fingers. He rubs against Dan in soft, gentle movements, still above his boxers. It\u2019s too teasing to be enough, but Dan shuts his eyes anyway, choking back a moan of bliss. </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d Phil asks, his voice quiet and husky.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes fly open, and he shakes his head. Phil doesn\u2019t seem to need any further confirmation. He dips his hand into the waistband of Dan\u2019s boxers, curling his fingers around the length of him. Dan chokes on something \u2013 the air, maybe \u2013 thrown by the confidence with which Phil moves considering this is, as far as Dan knows, his first time doing anything like this.</p><p>Dan\u2019s never been particularly vocal in bed unless asked, so he just buries his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder, whimpering as Phil\u2019s hand pumps a steady rhythm around him, gradually becoming slicker, messier as the build of his orgasm drags over Dan\u2019s body. Phil\u2019s movements are unpracticed, his hand is at an awkward angle, and he hasn\u2019t even pulled Dan\u2019s boxers down, but somehow it\u2019s beyond incredible.</p><p>Dan comes hard, unable to stop himself crying out as Phil sinks his teeth into the exposed skin of his neck, sucking a mark there. He shudders as the pleasure ebbs away, going limp in Phil\u2019s arms. Phil pulls his hand out from Dan\u2019s boxers, wiping it on the Muse logo. A few seconds of stunned silence pass in the wake of what just occurred, and then Dan moves, jumping to attention like a soldier going about his routine. He pushes his lips back into Phil\u2019s, just as hungry as before, and slides a hand down his torso, from collarbone to groin.</p><p>Phil catches hold of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Phil says hurriedly. Through the Muse t-shirt, Dan can feel his heart pounding.</p><p>He stares at Phil, confused. \u201cLet me\u2026 help you out.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles at him, though it seems a bit strained. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. Let\u2019s just go to sleep, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Dan scans his face, trying to suss out why on earth somebody would refuse a return offer in this situation, but he comes up short. Hey, maybe Phil is just a little strange. Maybe his first time nerves kicked in a little later than expected.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Dan asks. His tongue flicks out to play with his lip ring, flirtatious. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, you know.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s gaze hones in on the lip ring, and he swallows thickly. \u201cY-yeah, really. I\u2019m just tired. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Dan shuffles down, getting comfy again. It\u2019s difficult, because he\u2019d ideally like a shower right now, preferably one with Phil, but it\u2019s obviously not going to happen, so Dan\u2019s gonna just have to suck it up. But not literally, apparently.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says after some thought. He shuffles closer to Phil, a warm and hopeful glow pulsating in his gut for the first time in years. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long time before Phil replies.</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178893484577/edgelorddan-x-obliviousbisexualphil-au-chapter\">Chapter Seven!</a>)</b></p>",

He hates having to clean the entire coffee machine inside and out. He hates the pressure of counting the money in the till, especially as he sucks at maths.</p><p>He hates having to wipe down every table and surface. He hates having to restock the milk in the fridge and the sugar on the counter. He loathes having to switch off every single light one by one, letting the shadows crawl out of their corners and smother the place. He usually does this final task at the last possible moment, so that he can just walk straight to the door and leave as soon as possible. The caf&eacute;, which is quite a sweet, pretty place with a soft, happy feel in the daytime, becomes something evil in the dark.</p><p>Tonight however, it&rsquo;s not so bad. The late shift is given to Dan at least once a week, because he&rsquo;s worked here a lot longer than most of the other staff, and so can be trusted. He&rsquo;s done it so many times that he could do it blindfolded, he&rsquo;s sure, so Louise allows him to do it on his own.</p><p>Tonight, he&rsquo;s not on his own.</p><p>Phil walked to work with him today, and has stayed ever since. He has seemed perfectly content all evening, sat at a table for two in the corner by the window, drawing in his sketchpad. He&rsquo;s ordered at least three coffees, which he&rsquo;ll probably regret once he gets home and can&rsquo;t sleep, but Dan isn&rsquo;t going to lecture him again. The last customer left around twenty minutes ago, and Phil is still there, frowning down at whatever he&rsquo;s sketching. Dan has just finished counting up, so he walks over to Phil&rsquo;s table to collect the mug he&rsquo;s been drinking from.</p><p>&ldquo;You planning on sleeping here?&rdquo; He asks, picking up the mug and saucer.</p><p>Phil looks up at him in surprise. &ldquo;Oh, hey let me take that.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan snorts at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s literally my job, Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan walks away then, shaking his head fondly at Phil&rsquo;s owlish protestations.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I slowing you down?&rdquo; Phil calls as Dan heads into the kitchen. &ldquo;I can go if you like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Dan calls back, rinsing the crockery before stacking it into the dishwasher. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t make a mess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of creepy here after hours,&rdquo; Phil says as Dan walks back out. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you do it all on your own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not on my own,&rdquo; Dan counters.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a hesitance on Phil&rsquo;s face when Dan glances at him. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m nuts, don&rsquo;t you? For going through with the date.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looks away, busying himself with stacking chairs. The scraping of the legs on the tiled floor makes him wince. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly brave.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil snorts. &ldquo;Brave. Because you think it&rsquo;s a joke. That she doesn&rsquo;t actually like me, and that she&rsquo;s doing it to get back at Hardy.&rdquo;</p><p>A chair clatters from Dan&rsquo;s hands, and he curses. Instead of picking it back up, he turns to Phil. &ldquo;It might have crossed my mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s what everyone thinks,&rdquo; Phil says, shrugging. &ldquo;That she&rsquo;s just using me. I get it. It&rsquo;s ridiculous to think she&rsquo;d actually consider me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with you, Phil,&rdquo; Dan says quietly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how they are in the Elite. They don&rsquo;t think about the feelings of people like us. The only time they even acknowledge us is if we can benefit their lives in some way. Getting them coffee. Giving them lifts home. Making their boyfriend&rsquo;s jealous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Phil says dismissively, frowning in an uncharacteristic way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still gonna go through with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Getting through to Phil is like trying to get through to the floor beneath his feet. </p><p>&ldquo;Even if you know for sure that she&rsquo;s stringing you along?&rdquo; Dan asks, barely disguising his frustration. &ldquo;Phil, that&rsquo;s suicidal. If she&rsquo;s purposefully dangling you in front of Hardy Jenns you&rsquo;re gonna get your ass kicked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s her intention going in, that&rsquo;s her problem. I&rsquo;m gonna change her mind by the time the date is over,&rdquo; Phil says confidently. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, now I do think you&rsquo;re nuts,&rdquo; Dan says.</p><p>He begins stacking the chairs again, loudly and with a recklessness that he wouldn&rsquo;t normally. He should drop this, change the subject or something. But the irritation is overwhelming. Phil can&rsquo;t see two feet under his nose. He&rsquo;s being stubborn, because he feels he has to prove he can go through with this now, even though every star in the sky is screaming at him to turn back. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about it a lot, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I can see that,&rdquo; Dan says, rolling his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Phil insists. &nbsp;I think I can make her see that it&rsquo;s better to be in the real world with the rest of us, rather than up in the clouds of the Elite. That she&rsquo;d be happier without all the drama and the materialism and the seedy guys.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan snorts. &ldquo;How&rsquo;re you gonna show her that, exactly? What&rsquo;ve you got to offer her apart from a paintbrush and some overpriced jewellery? I mean, have you even properly kissed a girl?&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t mean it to come out so harshly, but he&rsquo;s angry, and his tongue doesn&rsquo;t listen to him when he gets into a state. He shuts his eyes, placing the chair in his hands down.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he says bitterly, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Phil interrupts. He stands slowly from his chair and lifts it onto the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only ever kissed one person. It&rsquo;s been worrying me a little, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stares at him through the legs of several chairs, trying to think of something to say.</p><p>&ldquo;You think Amanda would notice something like that?&rdquo; Phil asks, meeting Dan&rsquo;s eye. His raw, genuine concern is so obvious in his expression that Dan has to tear his gaze away.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; He can&rsquo;t stop himself saying it, because it&rsquo;s the truth. &ldquo;Amanda Jones isn&rsquo;t likely to be fooled by an amateur kiss, if you ask me. That babe&rsquo;s got plenty of battle scars.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil rolls his eyes at the wording, but catches hold of his lower lip between his teeth, worrying it to and fro. &ldquo;You think?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods slowly, leaning against an unstacked table for some support. Something about this conversation feels dangerous. Dan can feel his heart racing, his palms growing damp. He swallows thickly, mouth suddenly dry. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you think you can deliver a kiss that kills, you probably can,&rdquo; Dan says, one shoulder shrugging. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Phil says hurriedly, taking a step towards him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no expert.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stares at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; it&rsquo;s all about, like,&rdquo; Dan flounders, feeling himself grow red. &ldquo;Confidence.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil ducks his chin towards his chest, then peers up at Dan, eyes sparkling with mischief. Before Dan can react, Phil&rsquo;s closing the short distance between them in three long strides, pushing him up against the table behind him. Dan&rsquo;s lungs seize up, but manages to gather himself enough to prevent himself from squealing at the unexpected attack.</p><p>&ldquo;Like this?&rdquo; Phil asks. </p><p>He&rsquo;s smirking like it&rsquo;s a stupid joke, but Dan&rsquo;s breaths are still getting stuck in his throat. Dan rolls his eyes, but there&rsquo;s no way Phil can&rsquo;t hear the hammering of his heart. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just ram her up against the table,&rdquo; Dan says, ever the sarcastic bitch. &ldquo;She definitely won&rsquo;t find that creepy.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil snickers. &ldquo;You seem to like it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead of obeying Dan&rsquo;s command, Phil seizes hold of him by the thighs and lifts him deftly onto the tabletop, slotting himself between Dan&rsquo;s legs. At this point, Dan is sure he&rsquo;ll combust, so he focuses all of his attention on the tasks he has left to do before locking up tonight. <i>Mop the floor in the kitchen, put the float into the safe, kick Phil in the balls for being such a fucking tease&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;So, what next?&rdquo;</p><p>Exasperated, Dan glares at him, struggling to break free of Phil&rsquo;s hold. &ldquo;Forget it, I did not sign up to be your snogging tutor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I&rsquo;m literally begging,&rdquo; Phil says, letting slip a sudden flash of the insecurity lurking beneath his flirtatious demeanour. &ldquo;I just need to know if I suck. I just need to be <i>passable</i>. You can help me, I know you can.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan is far, far too soft, he thinks, melting immediately, of course. Any resistance he may once have had was dissolved a few nights ago, in Phil&rsquo;s bed, when the realisation of his own feelings for the man avalanched down upon him. He&rsquo;s been trapped underneath the debris of that revelation ever since, struggling to breathe, aching and tortured, awaiting rescue that won&rsquo;t come. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, fine,&rdquo; Dan says, as if it&rsquo;s some huge inconvenience. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hands release Dan&rsquo;s thighs, clapping together in glee. &ldquo;Thank you, Dan. I owe you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At this point, your debt to me is higher than all of England.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, so what do I do now?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan struggles to focus, but catches sight of Phil&rsquo;s frantically fidgeting hands. He can start with that, at least. &ldquo;What are you gonna do with your hands?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil blinks at him, confused. &ldquo;Uh, it- it depends-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan tells him firmly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t depend. They go on my- on her hips.&rdquo; He blushes, waiting for this to register, but Phil just stares. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do it, you pleb.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckles nervously, but reaches out to place his hands on Dan&rsquo;s hips. They&rsquo;re just resting there, light as anything, but the touch of him, light and warm, still makes Dan want to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he chokes out. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll um- she&rsquo;ll probably do this.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stretches his own arms out, reaching up until he&rsquo;s got them locked around Phil&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what you&rsquo;d do?&rdquo; Phil asks, his voice sounding strange and thin. &ldquo;If I were- if it were you being kissed?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shrugs, disliking the question. &ldquo;Prob&rsquo;ly.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nods, drinking down the information like it&rsquo;s gold. &ldquo;Okay, what now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, close your eyes,&rdquo; Dan instructs, and Phil does. He&rsquo;s so passively beautiful. All pale skin and dark lashes. Dan is not in any way ready for what&rsquo;s about to happen here. How the fuck did he get himself into this situation? &ldquo;Now, lean in really close to me, but&hellip; don&rsquo;t touch me yet.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s no denying that at this point, self indulgence has come into play. Dan can&rsquo;t bring himself to feel too bad about it. He&rsquo;s never going to get an opportunity like this again, and in all likelihood Phil&rsquo;s too clueless to cotton on to whether Dan might be a little biased in his instruction. Phil closes some of the distance between them, their lips close now; Dan tightens his lock around Phil&rsquo;s neck. He smells like the caramel macchiatos Dan&rsquo;s been making for him all evening.</p><p>He lets Phil wait for it. In Dan&rsquo;s opinion, the best part about a kiss is the build up. It&rsquo;s the space between them, humming with an electric yearning. It&rsquo;s the eyes darting to one another&rsquo;s mouths, and the slow, careful dance around the minefield of wrong moves as they work up to it.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan whispers, knowing his breath will sizzle against Phil&rsquo;s lips. He feels Phil shiver, and it makes his stomach flip. &ldquo;Now, open your eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>Confused, Phil does as told. He seems a little stunned to see Dan up so close.</p><p>&ldquo;Like this?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods, their noses brushing. &ldquo;Tell her something.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil frowns. &ldquo;Tell her what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you want,&rdquo; Dan near-whispers. For some reason, his eyes sting. He focuses them on Phil&rsquo;s tongue as it sweeps over his lower lip. &ldquo;Tell her she&rsquo;s got pretty eyes, or she&rsquo;s a hot babe. Whatever you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling her she&rsquo;s a hot babe,&rdquo; Phil says, rolling his eyes. He seems a little pink-cheeked, though. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m certainly not telling you you&rsquo;re a hot babe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So tell me something else, then,&rdquo; Dan says before he can stop himself. &ldquo;I mean, pretend I&rsquo;m her. <i>Amanda</i>. And tell me what you want to tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretend you&rsquo;re her?&rdquo; Phil asks, eyes roving over Dan&rsquo;s face as though it&rsquo;s an impossible feat.</p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a stretch Phil, but try it.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil is silent, his lips pressing together as he surveys Dan, still so close that he&rsquo;s probably all blurry in Phil&rsquo;s vision anyway. Eventually, Dan kicks him.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he prompts, heart stuttering already. </p><p>His palms have gone past clammy into damp; he feels a bit dizzy, from the coffees he&rsquo;s been drinking, and the cigarette he hasn&rsquo;t had yet. This is something from his wildest, most surreal dreams, something he honestly never thought would happen, and here it is, right in front of him. He blinks, but it doesn&rsquo;t go away. Phil is still so irresistibly close, the blue around his eyes thinned to a sliver, his heartbeat loud enough to hear. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most beautiful thing&hellip;&rdquo; Phil starts to say, his voice slow and quiet. &ldquo;I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s breath catches, and he feels his eyes sting again. He nods. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; Phil asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Now kiss me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes widen, but he leans forwards readily. Dan&rsquo;s breath hitches again, and he finds himself drawing back a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he says hurriedly. He fixes Phil with a hard stare, trying to appear as unaffected as possible. &ldquo;If you stick your tongue in my mouth, I will bite it off, do you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughs, looking a little relieved, and nods. Then, the hands on his hips yank him forwards, and Dan is being kissed. Slowly at first, tentative and unsure, but then harder, hungrier, as though some levee inside of Phil has broken. His hands tighten on Dan&rsquo;s hips, fingers pushing into Dan&rsquo;s skin, so hard it could bruise.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s lips drag Dan&rsquo;s apart; he flicks his tongue against Dan&rsquo;s lip ring, then pushes it into Dan&rsquo;s mouth, breaking the one, singular rule Dan had given him, but he finds he doesn&rsquo;t even care. He never meant it anyway. He likes tongue. He would give anything not to know the taste of Phil&rsquo;s, but only because he&rsquo;ll never know it again. </p><p>He tastes like coffee, and caramel, and the bitter lead of his pencil when he licks the tip. Dan whimpers as these flavours unfurl across his taste buds; he pulls himself closer to Phil by the vice grip he has around his neck.</p><p>They kiss for what feels like hours, but it still isn&rsquo;t enough. There&rsquo;s a sudden vibration against his thigh, from what must be the phone in Phil&rsquo;s pocket. Like a shock of icy water thrown in his face, he remembers the time. He remembers the day, his own name, his tragedy of a life, and more importantly, who Phil is thinking about right now.</p><p>Somehow, along with the surge of disgust for himself that rises like bile in his throat, Dan manages to summon the strength to unwind his arms from Phil&rsquo;s neck and shove, hard, against his chest. Phil stumbles backwards, shocked, his lips wet and reddened. There&rsquo;s an indent in their corner from where Dan&rsquo;s lip ring has pressed into his flesh, and the sight of it is making Dan want to throw up.</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking hell, Phil,&rdquo; Dan pants, staring at him. Phil just stares, stunned, breathing heavily. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need lessons, okay? You&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan swallows, hands braced against the table as he tries to gain some control. How did he just let that happen? He is so, so fucked.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Phil says at last. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what- you&rsquo;re just so, um, pretty, and it was all nice and familiar- I guess I just&hellip; I got carried away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Carried away,&rdquo; Dan repeats with a humourless laugh, still breathless. &ldquo;Just a little.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil ducks his head, his cheeks a little flushed. &ldquo;Thanks, though. For helping me.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shakes his head, barely able to believe his ears. He feels a rush of hot, stinging anger flooding his veins, and he glares at Phil, unable to suppress it.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. What else am I here for, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About the only thing I&rsquo;m good for, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Dan spits out. He stands from the table on jelly legs, untying his apron and yanking it off. &ldquo;As the town whore, you might as well use me for practise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, what- that is not why I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Save it,&rdquo; Dan growls, stalking past Phil towards the kitchen.</p><p>He pushes through the door, trying to ignore that his throat feels like he&rsquo;s swallowed a lump of burning hot coal.\t</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you, I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; Phil calls from the caf&eacute; floor. Dan leans his head back against the kitchen door separating them, shutting his eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened, I just- fuck. Please don&rsquo;t be annoyed.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan bites down hard on his lip, hating that he can still taste Phil there, all sickly sweet syrup and a rich, malty aftertaste.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; Phil calls out again. &ldquo;Please talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a push from the other side of the door, jolting Dan forwards. He moves out of its path, letting Phil swing it open. He stands in the doorway, looking shame-faced.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Dan sighs, running a hand through his hair. &ldquo;That&hellip; happened. Let&rsquo;s just move the fuck on.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nods, still a little dazed. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods, brushing past him as he goes to finish closing up the caf&eacute;. Phil just watches him perform the medial little tasks that need doing with a glazed expression, looking like a lost child.<br />Dan is about a hundred percent sure he missed something on his to-do list by the time he gets his jacket, but he can&rsquo;t be bothered to check. Louise can yell at him, he doesn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Dan says to Phil, his voice gruff still.</p><p>He walks to the door, jingling the keys, and opens it for Phil to step out into the dark street. Dan switches all the lights off without looking back, and follows him outside to lock the doors.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining,&rdquo; Phil says, as if Dan hadn&rsquo;t noticed the moisture pelting him from above.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; Dan replies, turning the final lock.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I come over?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan freezes, trying not to react. He turns to Phil slowly, a frown creasing his brow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil cocks his head like a spaniel. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan purses his lips, looking up at the rainclouds, invisible in the dark. &ldquo;Several reasons.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t mention that one of them is that he needs some time to privately flip the memory of Phil kissing him over and over in his mad, analytical brain until it&rsquo;s wrung dry. He can already tell that that moment in time will forever be etched into his brain, just like his hips will always feel the ghost of Phil&rsquo;s grip, and his lips&hellip; well. No other kiss will ever again mean anything, Dan is sure.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Prom tomorrow,&rdquo; Phil says, his voice small. Dan rolls his eyes, wondering if Phil really thinks he could have forgotten when it&rsquo;s literally all they&rsquo;ve talked about for weeks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still gonna drive us, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sighs, desperately wishing he had enough spine to refuse right now. &ldquo;Said I would, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>He stuffs the keys into his pocket, flicks up the hood of his jacket and starts walking down the street. Phil follows at his side, hands stuffed into the pocket of his hoodie. Silvery puffs of air escape from his mouth as he breathes; suddenly, Dan remembers his vice, digging into his back pocket. The packet&rsquo;s a little damp, but he pulls a cigarette out with his teeth, uncaring.</p><p>&ldquo;I just thought maybe you&rsquo;d have changed your mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan ducks into a doorway, lighting the end of his cigarette. They&rsquo;re thin and black, these weird cherry flavoured ones, which is undeniably fitting to his aesthetic and mood. &ldquo;And pass up three bags of Skittles? No way.&rdquo;</p><p>He inhales, then continues walking, Phil still trudging along at his side. &ldquo;So, I can come over, then?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re literally following me home right now. It&rsquo;s not like I have much of a choice.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil says nothing, but when Dan sneaks a glance at his expression, misted from the rain, he&rsquo;s smiling. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;</p><p>The whisper filters through the filmy layer of Dan&rsquo;s mind, hauling him out of the dream he was about to slip into.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, are you awake?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s voice sounds strange.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; Dan says, stirring. &ldquo;I am now.&rdquo;</p><p>He opens his eyes crossly, irritated at being woken from what was sure to be a lovely, long sleep. The first thing he notices, even in the pitch black, is that Phil is very close to him. They&rsquo;re sharing Dan&rsquo;s single bed, so obviously their proximity is a little more than normal, but he&rsquo;s shifted towards Dan&rsquo;s side significantly.</p><p>Dan tries to put some distance back between them, but he&rsquo;s got the wall behind him. He gives up, mind swirling in an attempt to distract himself from the fact that Phil is wearing his old Muse t-shirt and boxers, and is pressed almost against him, in his bed. Only hours ago, they&rsquo;d been making out on a table in a closed cafe. Dan no longer feels very sleepy. Phil is staring straight at him, across the pillow. He&rsquo;s chewing his lip, a worried crease between his brows.</p><p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Dan asks sleepily. His heart races. &ldquo;Did you hear Ricky come home?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shakes his head, and Dan&rsquo;s lets out a quiet sigh of relief.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about earlier,&rdquo; Phil says quietly; Dan really wishes he hadn&rsquo;t said it at all. &ldquo;The kiss, I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shrugs a shoulder. &ldquo;S&rsquo;okay.&rdquo;</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t, though. It&rsquo;s far from okay, it&rsquo;s made everything a hell of a lot worse, but Phil doesn&rsquo;t know about Dan&rsquo;s feelings, so it&rsquo;s not all his fault. Phil&rsquo;s hand slides onto his hip. It&rsquo;s warm, and gripping a little too tightly to be normal. Dan stares at him, entirely lost on what&rsquo;s happening.</p><p>&ldquo;You smell like cherries again,&rdquo; Phil tells him, so quiet it&rsquo;s barely audible. &ldquo;You taste like cherries, too.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan has no idea what to say, but it turns out he needn&rsquo;t bother. Phil shifts closer still, that hand on his hip gripping tighter, and then their lips are pressed together. Phil is purposeful, searching, kissing Dan with the same unexpected intensity that he had back in the caf&eacute;. For a fleeting second, Dan is able to hold onto his resistance. He remains rigid, certain that this is a mistake, that Phil is not in his right mind, and that he should not give in to it. But Phil is stubborn, he is patient, and desperate. The hand on his hip feels like a plea, and Dan could never resist Phil&rsquo;s begging. So he gives in, falls into the welcome warmth of Phil&rsquo;s wave of wanting. He kisses Phil like he&rsquo;s starving, not concerned with breaking away this time because he initiated it, there are no &lsquo;kissing lessons&rsquo; to disguise it. This is unprecedented, unprovoked, and entirely Phil&rsquo;s decision.</p><p>The hand on Dan&rsquo;s hip slips round to grab at his bum, mostly to pull their bodies closer together. Dan gasps, allowing his limp, exhausted body to mould itself around Phil&rsquo;s chest and legs. He imagines the clothes gone, the warm, smooth skin of him beneath, and groans. He winds his hands into Phil&rsquo;s t-shirt, feeling the heady arousal sweep from his lips, down his chest, and between his legs, leaving a flush in its wake. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hand works its way between them, finding the telltale bump of Dan&rsquo;s erection and pressing against it. Dan gasps, pulling back from the kiss to look into Phil&rsquo;s eyes. He should say something, make sure Phil is really sure he wants to do this, but the words die with a firm push of Phil&rsquo;s fingers. He rubs against Dan in soft, gentle movements, still above his boxers. It&rsquo;s too teasing to be enough, but Dan shuts his eyes anyway, choking back a moan of bliss. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to stop?&rdquo; Phil asks, his voice quiet and husky.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes fly open, and he shakes his head. Phil doesn&rsquo;t seem to need any further confirmation. He dips his hand into the waistband of Dan&rsquo;s boxers, curling his fingers around the length of him. Dan chokes on something &ndash; the air, maybe &ndash; thrown by the confidence with which Phil moves considering this is, as far as Dan knows, his first time doing anything like this.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s never been particularly vocal in bed unless asked, so he just buries his face in Phil&rsquo;s shoulder, whimpering as Phil&rsquo;s hand pumps a steady rhythm around him, gradually becoming slicker, messier as the build of his orgasm drags over Dan&rsquo;s body. Phil&rsquo;s movements are unpracticed, his hand is at an awkward angle, and he hasn&rsquo;t even pulled Dan&rsquo;s boxers down, but somehow it&rsquo;s beyond incredible.</p><p>Dan comes hard, unable to stop himself crying out as Phil sinks his teeth into the exposed skin of his neck, sucking a mark there. He shudders as the pleasure ebbs away, going limp in Phil&rsquo;s arms. Phil pulls his hand out from Dan&rsquo;s boxers, wiping it on the Muse logo. A few seconds of stunned silence pass in the wake of what just occurred, and then Dan moves, jumping to attention like a soldier going about his routine. He pushes his lips back into Phil&rsquo;s, just as hungry as before, and slides a hand down his torso, from collarbone to groin.</p><p>Phil catches hold of his wrist.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Phil says hurriedly. Through the Muse t-shirt, Dan can feel his heart pounding.</p><p>He stares at Phil, confused. &ldquo;Let me&hellip; help you out.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiles at him, though it seems a bit strained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, really. Let&rsquo;s just go to sleep, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan scans his face, trying to suss out why on earth somebody would refuse a return offer in this situation, but he comes up short. Hey, maybe Phil is just a little strange. Maybe his first time nerves kicked in a little later than expected.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Dan asks. His tongue flicks out to play with his lip ring, flirtatious. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s gaze hones in on the lip ring, and he swallows thickly. &ldquo;Y-yeah, really. I&rsquo;m just tired. Sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>Reluctantly, Dan shuffles down, getting comfy again. It&rsquo;s difficult, because he&rsquo;d ideally like a shower right now, preferably one with Phil, but it&rsquo;s obviously not going to happen, so Dan&rsquo;s gonna just have to suck it up. But not literally, apparently.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan says after some thought. He shuffles closer to Phil, a warm and hopeful glow pulsating in his gut for the first time in years. &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a long time before Phil replies.</p><p>&ldquo;Night.&rdquo;</p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178893484577/edgelorddan-x-obliviousbisexualphil-au-chapter\">Chapter Seven!</a>)</b></p>",

He hates having to clean the entire coffee machine inside and out. He hates the pressure of counting the money in the till, especially as he sucks at maths.</p>\n<p>He hates having to wipe down every table and surface. He hates having to restock the milk in the fridge and the sugar on the counter. He loathes having to switch off every single light one by one, letting the shadows crawl out of their corners and smother the place. He usually does this final task at the last possible moment, so that he can just walk straight to the door and leave as soon as possible.

The late shift is given to Dan at least once a week, because he&rsquo;s worked here a lot longer than most of the other staff, and so can be trusted.
