The user @rory.mccann.fever started an Instagram account and filled it with post after post of photos from other sources, without asking permission or giving credit to the original source. Sadly, it goes further than just pics from pro photographers. She has also posted personal snapshots, fan art, image edits that were done by other people, and more. Most of the images came from pages and websites belonging to beloved members of the Sansan fandom.</p><p>When the error of her ways was brought to her attention, her response was to delete comments and/or block anyone who told her she was wrong. She continued stealing and posting content, and several Sandor/Hound/Sansan accounts closed up shop in order to protect themselves.</p><p>Cut to today. This is her response, in writing, to being told once again that she was using content that was not hers and that she should at least credit the original source:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"895\" data-orig-width=\"1242\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5028a9fca9d004255b58d87eb78ce1ff/tumblr_pi1z3qtgeY1uuoxzq_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"895\" data-orig-width=\"1242\"/></figure><p>FUCK. HER. This was not a mistake or a misunderstanding. It was a blatant disregard for the work of others.</p><p>If you have an Instagram account, please make sure that you are not following this person.

Personally I don\u2019t think it will happen. I think Sansa\u2019s third and last marriage in the books will happen towards the end of the series and that\u2019s when she\u2019ll have sex for the first time (which is icky since she\u2019s 13-14 right now and she\u2019ll be 15 then maybe).</p><p>As for GRRM approving the Ramsay mess, this is a guy who implied a young girl was raped by dogs in ADWD for shock value. He isn\u2019t the feminist some people think that he is. He probably approved of the storyline because he thinks it\u2019s important. As if Theon can\u2019t regain his identity some other way, as if Jon\u2019s death in the show didn\u2019t have another cause, as if Stannis in the show rallied Northern Houses because the Boltons had Ned Stark\u2019s daughter. You could replace Sansa with a slab of meat and it would have the same overall effect (except on Sansa\u2019s mental health). I\u2019m equally pissed at people who act like Sansa\u2019s having the time of her life in the Vale. Littlefinger constantly sexually assaults her. She\u2019s sexually abused in both storylines but one of them is so utterly needless.</p>",

        "title": "Sansa must end happy and marry a man she loves, whom the viewers will trust.",
        "body": "<p>For me, it is clear that the series did not make gravitate so many men around Sansa to she ends up alone. <br/></p><p>The girl who has always dreamed of love and children knew only disillusionment, torment and violence. There was no point in bringing Sansa to a wedding with Ramsay if it was not to tell how one can survive such an ordeal. And I refuse to believe that she could marry someone that the viewers does not know. After seeing the real faces of the men with whom she has been, she can no longer trust so easily. Sansa has become too independent. Even if she longs for a married life, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d rather be alone than marry someone she does not like or know. The series must not only convince Sansa but the audience that the man she will marry will be trustworthy and make her happy.</p><p>Sansa dreamed of being queen, falling in love and having children. The show broke her dreams. These are the two majors points of her story: to teach her what it really means to rule and what it means to be with a man. She saw the cruelty, egoism and treachery of the rulers but also the cowardice, the violence and the lack of loyalty of the subjects. She finded out that men have sometimes unhealthy&rsquo;s desires, that some enjoy to hurt women, that everything does not happen as in the stories and that even if someone loves her it does not mean that he will put her interests before his, like Littlefinger did. It must be that ALL that ends somewhere. She was supposed to become queen and marry a prince. She was taught what it meant. And now, she finally understands. It is necessary that the season 8 brings her to really love someone and regained confidence in her and in men. She must end up in a position of power and happy in her love life. This is the purpose of her story.</p><p>The problem is that there are not many honest young men left. She can not be again with Tyrion as some people think. This would be a constant reminder of what she experienced at King&rsquo;s Landing. Not to mention the fact that she deserves better than a man like him. I&rsquo;m not saying that Tyrion is not good, only that he is too old, likes sex too much and drinks too much. Even if he was nice to her, they will not be able to really love each other. And she will not marry a man by political calculation either (she has already done it and it went wrong). So all that&rsquo;s left is Gendry and Jon. But Gendry has never been a noble. He has always lived in poor neighborhoods and, although he is very nice, may not be in his place with a castle life and with a wife who holds power.
