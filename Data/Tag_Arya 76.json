Not only is &ldquo;it&rsquo;s her choice to be feminine&rdquo; not a valid argument when we are talking about fictional characters who are the way they are because of the choices made by (male) creators (it can be a valid argument within the story but it does not deflect criticism of media from a Doylist perspective), but if we wanna talk about the choices <i>Sansa</i>, the character, had, becoming a tomboy was never one of them.</p><p>I think the argument being made was that Sansa is a great character because the abuse she experiences because of her femininity doesn&rsquo;t lead her to a misogynistic conclusion that femininity is stupid, which is a message I, on principal, agree with. I don&rsquo;t agree with the additional corallary that I often see, which is the idea that women who DO eschew traditional or compulsory femininity are somehow bad or sexist, because they aren&rsquo;t. And not wanting or being able to fit a patriarchal definition of femininity is not, by itself, misogyny. But I think what people are trying to get at is that we see a lot of portrayals in media of women who eschew femininity in a way that blames other women for being feminine, and yes, I am also tired of those narratives.</p><p>But the idea that Sansa Stark is actively making a choice not to be a tomboy or that she&rsquo;s going against expectations by not wearing pants or picking up a sword is wrong because she was never given that choice in the first place. She does not exist in a world where women are encouraged to pick up swords. Women in her world are derided and abused for being feminine, but absolutely still expected to perform it.</p><p>In fact, I think that&rsquo;s a big part of the conflict she has with Arya. Sansa&rsquo;s performance of femininity is extremely anxious and insecure at the beginning of the novel. The Stark girls live in a world where NOT performing femininity gets you punished, and Sansa grew up watching her sister be punished for failing to live up to that expectation. That&rsquo;s reflected in the way she distances herself from and reacts negatively to Arya, and the way she criticizes herself and compares herself negatively to Arya in times when she is being &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; or failing to live up to the expectations of the adults around her.</p><p>I do think that behind Sansa&rsquo;s resentment of Arya for failing to live up to expectations is a resentment that she has to be the good sister, the one who has to live up to the strict expectations imposed on a girl, even more so because of her sister&rsquo;s failure. Her parents encourage this when they praise Sansa for being a lady and criticize Arya. It&rsquo;s clear that Sansa also feels this as an additional burden on her because she remarks about how she expects Arya to be punished for picking wildflowers and resents that her parents don&rsquo;t punish her. Sansa clearly sees herself as the one who has to take on the role of being a &ldquo;lady&rdquo; especially because her sister won&rsquo;t.</p><p>I actually think that on some level Sansa resents that Arya is able to break free from and reject the standards she herself feels an anxious need to abide by. Which of course does not mean that Arya is more free from patriarchy or had more freedom to choose to reject it, because her choices absolutely come with consequences. This also does not mean that Sansa should be criticized for not trying to break out of those expecations. What it means is that neither girl is free to choose and both end up punished, regardless of their ability to perform femininity. Patriarchy is always a double-edged sword, and people need to remember that when they talk about choice in regards to these characters.</p>",
