        "answer": "<p>I think that it will continue to be as it has been thus far, which is essentially the relationship between a lady and her sworn sword. Every time they interacted thus far, it\u2019s through that lens. Brienne\u2019s role in Sansa\u2019s storyline essentially consist of protecting her and following her orders. The show has not been interesting in doing much else with their relationships and I am quite disappointing. Personally, I would have enjoyed them becoming friends, being comfortable with each other, and having deep one on one conversations that isn\u2019t related to work.

That doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not worth helping.&rdquo; - Meera Reed&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Like many of you, I&rsquo;ve heard how&nbsp;&ldquo;weak&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;useless&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;feeble&rdquo; Sansa is. The teaser for s8 where Jon and Arya pull out their swords and Sansa is standing between them fueled this Sansa beat down. Personally, I think it&rsquo;s simply an excuse because many just don&rsquo;t like her character. How else can we look at the yearly predictions that &ldquo;Sansa will&nbsp;betray Jon/betray the Starks!&rdquo;? People don&rsquo;t trust her because of what she did as an 11 y.o. (12 or 13 on the show). When she was naive, ignorant and didn&rsquo;t know NOT to trust the adults around her.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/75e119cf0ecc1203c0e22813bc53a6e7/tumblr_inline_pmvl9jsLNx1v7lmba_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But it still frustrates me, makes me shake my head and sometimes get pissed off.

I mostly understand all of her actions and they are justifiable considering the position that she was in and her age so I don\u2019t judge her for any of that. The one thing that kind of made me sad though was when Sansa was thinking of Arya and thought she was unsatisfactory as sisters went. I thought it was a bit harsh for her baby sister that could very well be dead. Do you think she loves or cares about Arya?",
        "answer": "<p>When Sansa thought that Arya was unsatisfactory as sisters went, I thought that it was valid for her to feel in such a way. Think about it, Sansa has three high born brothers and a half-brother, and they all do and prefer traditionally masculine activities. They train alongside each other and they enjoy the same hobbies, so they do these together as well. They have a sibling that they can not only relate to when it comes to having a similar daily life, but a sibling they can do what they love with. Then you have Sansa, who loves to sew, to dance, to sing, to play instruments, to read and write, to dress prettily, to listen to romantic stories, etc. A sister in the traditional sense of the word would in theory not only be good at all of these things, but more importantly, would enjoy to do them alongside Sansa. They could gossip, eat lemon cakes and and listen to stories of knightly valor together.\u00a0</p><p>This is where Arya comes in. Arya is her little sister. In theory, she\u2019s supposed to be the only member of the Stark household who she could do all of these activities in a daily level with. She\u2019s supposed to enjoy courtesies, enjoy gossiping, enjoy these romantic tales, enjoy these things that none of her other siblings even pretend to care about. However, Arya not only doesn\u2019t but acts in a way that doesn\u2019t fit with these conventions, and far prefers to do the same things that her brothers do. Not only that but all of her siblings collectively look down on what Sansa likes and wants. Jon has an extremely misogynistic view of the struggles of traditionally feminine women and is quick to dismiss them, Robb doesn\u2019t put as much value to his sisters as he does on Jaime, Bran has no wish to hang out with Arya and Sansa in the beginning of the series because they are girls, and later mocks the romantic stories that Sansa likes, and internally Arya consistently degrades everything that Sansa does, likes and wants. Not only do her siblings not enjoy the things that she does, but they look down on her for enjoying these things.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The moment that Sansa is thinking about how Arya is an unsatisfactory sister, she doesn\u2019t mean that Arya is an unsatisfactory sibling and that she particularly dislikes her, but rather that she doesn\u2019t do the conventional things that Sansa would come to expect from a sister in that society and so Sansa is often alone with the few friends that she has (who can\u2019t always be there to hang out with her). Sansa felt very lonely in Winterfell because of the limited amount of people she could relate to there, and there wasn\u2019t a wide outlet to enjoy all of the things that she liked. For example, singers don\u2019t often go North, nor are there tourneys there and songs and tourneys are two things that Sansa actively enjoy a lot.\u00a0 The quote about \u2018\u2019unsatisfactory sister\u2019\u2019 is especially important in relation to Margaery. She is someone Sansa immediately became attached to because she offered Sansa the opportunity to have a sibling that she could do all of these traditionally feminine things with. Even earlier in the series, Sansa laments the fact that she never got a sister she could relate to and do things she loves with. She often tries to include Arya or asks her to join her in doing something, but Arya either doesn\u2019t realize it, or flat out just doesn\u2019t want to do what Sansa wants to do. The contrary is just as valid. Arya proposed for Sansa to join her and Mycah but Sansa does not because she doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy the things that Arya often wants to do. Both are unwilling to compromise, but while Arya has other siblings she could do what she loves with (plus she interacts a lot with the small folk), Sansa does not have a sibling like that, and has very few friends. Her loneliness in Winterfell perfectly explains her wanting to leave that place and her wishing to have a traditionally feminine sibling.\u00a0</p>",

Not only that but all of her siblings collectively look down on what Sansa likes and wants. Jon has an extremely misogynistic view of the struggles of traditionally feminine women and is quick to dismiss them, Robb doesn&rsquo;t put as much value to his sisters as he does on Jaime, Bran has no wish to hang out with Arya and Sansa in the beginning of the series because they are girls, and later mocks the romantic stories that Sansa likes, and internally Arya consistently degrades everything that Sansa does, likes and wants. Not only do her siblings not enjoy the things that she does, but they look down on her for enjoying these things.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The moment that Sansa is thinking about how Arya is an unsatisfactory sister, she doesn&rsquo;t mean that Arya is an unsatisfactory sibling and that she particularly dislikes her, but rather that she doesn&rsquo;t do the conventional things that Sansa would come to expect from a sister in that society and so Sansa is often alone with the few friends that she has (who can&rsquo;t always be there to hang out with her). Sansa felt very lonely in Winterfell because of the limited amount of people she could relate to there, and there wasn&rsquo;t a wide outlet to enjoy all of the things that she liked. For example, singers don&rsquo;t often go North, nor are there tourneys there and songs and tourneys are two things that Sansa actively enjoy a lot.&nbsp; The quote about &lsquo;&rsquo;unsatisfactory sister&rsquo;&rsquo; is especially important in relation to Margaery. She is someone Sansa immediately became attached to because she offered Sansa the opportunity to have a sibling that she could do all of these traditionally feminine things with. Even earlier in the series, Sansa laments the fact that she never got a sister she could relate to and do things she loves with. She often tries to include Arya or asks her to join her in doing something, but Arya either doesn&rsquo;t realize it, or flat out just doesn&rsquo;t want to do what Sansa wants to do. The contrary is just as valid. Arya proposed for Sansa to join her and Mycah but Sansa does not because she doesn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy the things that Arya often wants to do. Both are unwilling to compromise, but while Arya has other siblings she could do what she loves with (plus she interacts a lot with the small folk), Sansa does not have a sibling like that, and has very few friends. Her loneliness in Winterfell perfectly explains her wanting to leave that place and her wishing to have a traditionally feminine sibling.&nbsp;</p>",
