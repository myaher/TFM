Study hall also happened to be one of the very few classes he had with Cyrus, which, if he was being honest, was one of the biggest factors in his liking of the class.<b><br/></b></p><p>He supposed he mostly enjoyed passing notes with Cyrus all class period. Most of the time, they say in desks next to each other so passing was easier, but it didn\u2019t stop them from walking by and dropping notes, passing them through books, or even the occasional paper airplane if they couldn\u2019t find seats together. No matter how it arrived, TJ loved getting the silly notes in Cyrus\u2019 half-cursive scribble. Even the way Cyrus wrote was just so incredibly<i> him </i>that TJ could hear the words in his voice as he read them.</p><p>Cyrus always meticulously folded each note, too, so that TJ almost felt bad opening them. He could never help it though, he always liked talking to Cyrus, even in written form. Even if it meant he had to ruin the perfect origami papers that came across his desk.</p><p>He was half into his novel for English class, when a cute paper crane landed on his desk in front of him, behind the book. He sighed, looking back at Cyrus who gave him a small shrug and continued to write in his notebook. He turned back and unfolded the crane.</p><p><i>Overheard Katie saying she can\u2019t concentrate when she has chemistry lab with you. Might just have to show up one day and put a screen around you so poor girl can actually focus on her work or something :/</i></p><p>TJ laughed, scribbling \u201c<i>jealous, are we?</i>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t think of any discernible reason why Cyrus wouldn\u2019t like Katie, after all. He refolded the note into quarters and passed it back under the desk. He could hear Cyrus laugh at his folding. He seemed to scribble and fold for what felt like ages, and TJ stared at the book pages as he listened. Maybe Cyrus <i>did</i> like Katie, and he was writing his confession. TJ tried not to feel too disappointed at that, though he couldn\u2019t focus on his novel any longer, his mind choosing to wander to the infinite possibilities where Cyrus and Katie somehow ended up together.</p><p>The note came back folded into a tiny, compact envelope. TJ opened it, surprised, or maybe a little relieved, to not find a huge block of text admitting Cyrus\u2019 feelings for Katie.</p><p>The reply did shock him, though.</p><p><i>Not jealous. Possibly. I mean, she isn\u2019t really wrong though. You\u2019re pretty cute.</i></p><p>The words had been quite obviously written, erased, and rewritten several times, which was probably why it had taken what felt like years to get the reply. It was more agonizing than texting. TJ stared at the paper, thinking of what this meant, although he was 1200% sure he was over analyzing. He chewed on his lip as he held the paper in front of him. He heard Cyrus quietly clear his throat, but he was too transfixed by the note to look over. He angled it into the sunlight filtering in from the window, seeing if he could make out what was erased, his heart racing. Cyrus cleared his throat again, louder.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kippen?\u201d TJ realized he hadn\u2019t been discreet about his note reading at all. His eyes snapped up. \u201cWould you care to read your note out loud for the class? I\u2019m sure Mr. Goodman is quite the comedian.\u201d TJ could feel all eyes in the room on him, except for Cyrus\u2019. He was probably looking just as embarrassed as TJ was, though he didn\u2019t have the courage to look back and check.</p><p>\u201cUm, no thanks, sir.\u201d came TJ\u2019s awkward reply. A few students laughed. TJ\u2019s grip on the sheet of paper tightened, slightly crumpling it with his fingers. They\u2019d have to pry this note out of his cold, dead hands anyway. His notes with Cyrus were always strictly confidential. He prepped for the worst, which was having to eat the note paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d like a detention, then?\u201d the teacher was now standing up from his seat. He was challenging him, probably trying to make an example.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d TJ replied, and a few students gasped. The teacher raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll get back to you with the time and date, then. Get back to work, both of you.\u201d he said, pointing at TJ before sitting back down in his chair, making a loud creaking noise. TJ would be surprised if he actually got detention for this, but he certainly felt much more like reading his novel, now.</p><p>TJ turned and winked at Cyrus behind him as he handed the paper back and picked up his book once again. A few minutes later, another note landed in front of TJ. It was on a smaller piece of paper, just crumpled into a ball. </p><p><i>Thanks for not reading the note. Yikes i\u2019m embarrassed.
