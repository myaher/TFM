It wasn&rsquo;t the first time in his life when he had eyes following his every move, but this was different. After all, one could expect that during late evening hours, in the privacy of his own bedroom, he deserved some peace and quiet.</p><p>Clearly not.</p><p>But the lurking presence wasn&rsquo;t unwelcome. It was expected and awaited and when soft paws landed on the bed, Tony lowered his book.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, buddy,&rdquo; he greeted his fluffy cat, &ldquo;need a lift?&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>Figaro didn&rsquo;t answer, green eyes not leaving Tony. He was a big cat and had no problems with putting his front paws on the bed while standing upright. There was a time when he didn&rsquo;t need to do it at all, and graciously had jumped on the covers, landing softly and taking his favorite spot, right in Tony&rsquo;s lap. No distance or height had been a match for him and his strong, fluffy legs. Those were the good times.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Tony put his book aside, and pushed the reading glasses further on his nose, before leaning out and carefully scooping the cat up by his rear paws. He grunted a bit during the action, Figaro was quite heavy and became even heavier because of his less active lifestyle. &ldquo;There you go. Good?&rdquo; he asked, settling Figaro in his lap and scratching his cat&rsquo;s cheeks with both hands. Figaro closed his eyes and purred. Yes, good.</p><p>Time was passing and from the gawky kitten Tony had found on the street one day, Figaro matured into a beautiful, playful fluffy boy. The Avengers Tower and Avengers Compound&rsquo;s furniture was thoroughly signed by endless claws marks coming from the sharp claws, the fur was flying in the air, and Figaro&rsquo;s strong, melodic meow and the sound of kitty paws running were well known to everyone. More time passed, and from a fluffy, robust ball of energy, Figaro mellowed into a regal adult, spending most of his days on naps and being pampered.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, clean for the night,&rdquo; Steve announced, leaving the en suite bathroom, and pausing for a second while he saw Figaro already claiming his husband to himself. The possessive little creature still tended to sneak in while he was out of the bed to get the best spot. The best spot being next to Tony, of course. &ldquo;Already here, huh?&rdquo; he asked, walking to the bed and lifting the covers up. He moved closer to Tony and joined in petting. &ldquo;How does he do that?&rdquo; he asked, meaning the way Figaro was always showing up while he was out of the picture.</p><p>&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; Tony answered with a smile, leaning his head against Steve&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;And thanks, by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One day you will have to clean the litter box on your own, Tony,&rdquo; Steve answered, sounding exasperated. Since Figaro turned twelve years old he gradually started to have problems with jumping. All his favorite spots had to be brought lower and Tony kept a stool around their floor, just to help his friend to get to higher places he still had insisted on getting to. From his youngest years, Figaro had been taught to use the toilet for his kitty needs, but when the jumping problems started, to save Figaro stress, litter boxes started to appear. Luckily, Figaro knew right away what they were for, and Tony was beaming, once again claiming that his cat was the smartest. Steve wasn&rsquo;t beaming so much, realizing that once again all the dirty work would fall on him. Vet visits, claw trimming, now litter box - it was all on him, while Tony fed Figaro snacks and got all the love.</p><p>&ldquo;But I did that when he was little,&rdquo; Tony whined playfully, reminiscing the first nights Figaro had spent as a kitten on their floor. It didn&rsquo;t take long until Tony taught Figaro how to use the toilet, but he couldn&rsquo;t unseen things from back then.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you did,&rdquo; Steve agreed, smiling to the memory. Twelve years had passed quickly. Many things had happened during that time, both sad and happy and it all lead them to this moment. Steve wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing. Feeling content, he kissed the top of his husband&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yhm,&rdquo; Tony agreed and took off his glasses, putting them on the night table. &ldquo;Oh, did you give Figaro his vitamins today?&rdquo; he asked, hand reaching halfway to the lamp.</p><p>Steve huffed out a small laugh. &ldquo;And did you take your vitamins today?&rdquo; he asked back.</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Tony answered immediately, sounding offended.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you did?&rdquo;</p><p>The question was hanging in the air and Tony narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;Damn, you are good,&rdquo; he seethed out, his hand reaching into the drawer.</p><p>&ldquo;Only because I love you,&rdquo; Steve hummed, kissing Tony&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah,&rdquo; Tony muttered, popping some pills into his mouth and swallowing.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, swallow it dry, huh?&rdquo; Steve asked, sounding unimpressed.</p><p>Tony grinned. &ldquo;I am a professional,&rdquo; as soon as he said that he gasped and covered Figaro&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Not in front of my son.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve laughed and rolled on his back, spreading on his side of the bed. &ldquo;Your son is an adult. In human years he is closer to my age than you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it is a nice change to be the youngest.&rdquo;</p><p>It was supposed to be a joke. Something in Tony&rsquo;s tone told Steve that it wasn&rsquo;t. He lay on his side and looked at Tony with concern before his face changed into a scolding one. &ldquo;Babe, don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not doing anything,&rdquo; Tony said, sounding somehow distant and running fingers through his hair. There were more and more silver streaks appearing among the brown ones, but Tony wasn&rsquo;t bothered that much. At this point, he was grateful his hair wasn&rsquo;t thinning out. He looked at Figaro curled in his lap and stroked the black fur. It felt soft and smooth and full, all thanks to the good food and a lot of care. Nothing could stop time, and some previously black hair turned gray, but they were scarce and barely noticeable among the fluff. Still, in Tony&rsquo;s opinion, it didn&rsquo;t make Figaro any less charming. Steve was wondering when the same kind of philosophy Tony would apply to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to sleep, Tony,&rdquo; Steve reminded and turned the lights off. He waited for his husband to lower himself into the covers and gently slid Figaro off of his lap and to the middle of the bed. Steve put his head next to Tony&rsquo;s on the pillow, their legs entwining together. It was all the contact they could get with Figaro in between them, but after all those years, they got used to it. And they knew that there would come a day, they would miss their big cat taking half of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you, babe,&rdquo; Steve yawned. Proclaiming their love to each other every time before sleep was their small ritual, one they continued to do for as long as they remembered, no matter the distance or time difference. It was comforting for them both.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you back,&rdquo; Tony answered, always meaning it. &ldquo;Love you, Fig.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too, Fig,&rdquo; Steve cooed and petted the cat between them, and Figaro didn&rsquo;t say anything, but they could feel the love anyway. It was getting calm and sleepy, until -</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Steve\u2026&rdquo; Tony whispered, aware that maybe his husband had already nodded off and he didn&rsquo;t want to disturb him.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm?&rdquo; Steve answered, and something in his voice told Tony that he wasn&rsquo;t that far in dreamland and he could continue. And Tony had some important question to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;You remember that day you found your first gray hair?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled into the pillow. &ldquo;How could I forget it,&rdquo; he laughed at the memory. It had happened a few years back, and Tony had walked on Steve sobbing on the bathroom floor, which scared the hell out of him. Turned out that the tears were from happiness, as Steve finally had a proof that his body was aging, it was just a slower process for him and he enthusiastically kept showing everyone his first silver hair among the dark blond strands. It was a hilariously, weird day and after the initial shock, Tony had fond memories of it.</p><p>&ldquo;You really scared me back then,&rdquo; Tony reminded with a pout.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny, it was the day I stopped being scared,&rdquo; Steve replied. Outliving his loved ones and being alone was one of his greatest fears and the single silver hair on his head put an end to it. It was such a relief. &ldquo;Who wants to live forever.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony hummed in understanding. &ldquo;I see your point, but I am kinda disappointed. I was getting used to the thought that my husband will be hot forever- AH!&rdquo; Tony yelped, suddenly yanked closer, &ldquo;no - wait! Fig&rsquo;s between us!&rdquo; he protested, but Figaro already evacuated himself to the calmer part of the bed. He still was quick and had enough of years of experience to know that whenever his blond human friend joined them in bed, some wrestling would happen. That&rsquo;s why he tried to have an earlier moment with his dark-haired human friend. A cat would think that humans were better at controlling themselves, but no. It was mating season all year round.</p><p>&ldquo;Fig&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nooo - Steve, ack! Wahahahit! Need to use the bathroom!&rdquo;</p><p>And the wrestling stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;What, again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fiiine,&rdquo; Steve rolled away and tucked hands underneath himself. For now. He watched Tony get up from the bed. &ldquo;You need to get that prostate exam done,&rdquo; Steve reminded in a harsh tone. Much to his dismay, Tony turned to him with a shining grin he could perfectly see in the darkness.</p><p>&ldquo;I rather have you exam my prostate,&rdquo; Tony purred out, a panicked yelp following when he saw Steve actually lifting himself up. Before Steve could sit, Tony already ran into the bathroom, and Steve sunk back into the covers with a quiet laugh. He stayed in the darkness and felt warm paws walking on him before a solid warm weight settled on his chest and green eyes looked at him. Just then Figaro pressed his head affectionately against Steve&rsquo;s forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, pal,&rdquo; Steve greeted, scratching Figaro behind the ear. Fig walked a customary circle on Steve&rsquo;s chest, before he curled into a big, fluffy ball, ready to sleep. As the petting continued, Figaro started to purr and it was a soothing sound. Then another sound joined when Tony decided to give an a cappella performance in his warm baritone, singing &rsquo;<i>who wants to be hot forever, Steve will be hot forever</i>&rsquo;, his own adaptation of one of the greatest music hits in history. Listening to his cat&rsquo;s purring and his cougar husband&rsquo;s singing, Steve closed eyes to sleep, thinking that having two senior cats in the house, wasn&rsquo;t so bad.<br/></p>",

Still, in Tony\u2019s opinion, it didn\u2019t make Figaro any less charming. Steve was wondering when the same kind of philosophy Tony would apply to himself.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to sleep, Tony,\u201d Steve reminded and turned the lights off. He waited for his husband to lower himself into the covers and gently slid Figaro off of his lap and to the middle of the bed. Steve put his head next to Tony\u2019s on the pillow, their legs entwining together. It was all the contact they could get with Figaro in between them, but after all those years, they got used to it. And they knew that there would come a day, they would miss their big cat taking half of the bed.</p><p>\u201cLove you, babe,\u201d Steve yawned. Proclaiming their love to each other every time before sleep was their small ritual, one they continued to do for as long as they remembered, no matter the distance or time difference. It was comforting for them both.</p><p>\u201cLove you back,\u201d Tony answered, always meaning it. \u201cLove you, Fig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Fig,\u201d Steve cooed and petted the cat between them, and Figaro didn\u2019t say anything, but they could feel the love anyway. It was getting calm and sleepy, until -</p><p>\u201cHey, Steve\u2026\u201d Tony whispered, aware that maybe his husband had already nodded off and he didn\u2019t want to disturb him.</p><p>\u201cMhmm?\u201d Steve answered, and something in his voice told Tony that he wasn\u2019t that far in dreamland and he could continue. And Tony had some important question to ask.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that day you found your first gray hair?\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled into the pillow. \u201cHow could I forget it,\u201d he laughed at the memory. It had happened a few years back, and Tony had walked on Steve sobbing on the bathroom floor, which scared the hell out of him. Turned out that the tears were from happiness, as Steve finally had a proof that his body was aging, it was just a slower process for him and he enthusiastically kept showing everyone his first silver hair among the dark blond strands. It was a hilariously, weird day and after the initial shock, Tony had fond memories of it.</p><p>\u201cYou really scared me back then,\u201d Tony reminded with a pout.</p><p>\u201cFunny, it was the day I stopped being scared,\u201d Steve replied. Outliving his loved ones and being alone was one of his greatest fears and the single silver hair on his head put an end to it. It was such a relief. \u201cWho wants to live forever.\u201d</p><p>Tony hummed in understanding. \u201cI see your point, but I am kinda disappointed. I was getting used to the thought that my husband will be hot forever- AH!\u201d Tony yelped, suddenly yanked closer, \u201cno - wait! Fig\u2019s between us!\u201d he protested, but Figaro already evacuated himself to the calmer part of the bed. He still was quick and had enough of years of experience to know that whenever his blond human friend joined them in bed, some wrestling would happen. That\u2019s why he tried to have an earlier moment with his dark-haired human friend. A cat would think that humans were better at controlling themselves, but no. It was mating season all year round.</p><p>\u201cFig\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo - Steve, ack! Wahahahit! Need to use the bathroom!\u201d</p><p>And the wrestling stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat, again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiiine,\u201d Steve rolled away and tucked hands underneath himself. For now. He watched Tony get up from the bed. \u201cYou need to get that prostate exam done,\u201d Steve reminded in a harsh tone. Much to his dismay, Tony turned to him with a shining grin he could perfectly see in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI rather have you exam my prostate,\u201d Tony purred out, a panicked yelp following when he saw Steve actually lifting himself up. Before Steve could sit, Tony already ran into the bathroom, and Steve sunk back into the covers with a quiet laugh. He stayed in the darkness and felt warm paws walking on him before a solid warm weight settled on his chest and green eyes looked at him. Just then Figaro pressed his head affectionately against Steve\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cHey, pal,\u201d Steve greeted, scratching Figaro behind the ear. Fig walked a customary circle on Steve\u2019s chest, before he curled into a big, fluffy ball, ready to sleep. As the petting continued, Figaro started to purr and it was a soothing sound. Then another sound joined when Tony decided to give an a cappella performance in his warm baritone, singing \u2019<i>who wants to be hot forever, Steve will be hot forever</i>\u2019, his own adaptation of one of the greatest music hits in history. Listening to his cat\u2019s purring and his cougar husband\u2019s singing, Steve closed eyes to sleep, thinking that having two senior cats in the house, wasn\u2019t so bad.<br></p>",

It wasn\u2019t the first time in his life when he had eyes following his every move, but this was different. After all, one could expect that during late evening hours, in the privacy of his own bedroom, he deserved some peace and quiet.</p><p>Clearly not.</p><p>But the lurking presence wasn\u2019t unwelcome. It was expected and awaited and when soft paws landed on the bed, Tony lowered his book.</p><p>\u201cHi, buddy,\u201d he greeted his fluffy cat, \u201cneed a lift?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Figaro didn\u2019t answer, green eyes not leaving Tony. He was a big cat and had no problems with putting his front paws on the bed while standing upright. There was a time when he didn\u2019t need to do it at all, and graciously had jumped on the covers, landing softly and taking his favorite spot, right in Tony\u2019s lap. No distance or height had been a match for him and his strong, fluffy legs. Those were the good times.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Tony put his book aside, and pushed the reading glasses further on his nose, before leaning out and carefully scooping the cat up by his rear paws. He grunted a bit during the action, Figaro was quite heavy and became even heavier because of his less active lifestyle. \u201cThere you go. Good?\u201d he asked, settling Figaro in his lap and scratching his cat\u2019s cheeks with both hands. Figaro closed his eyes and purred. Yes, good.</p><p>Time was passing and from the gawky kitten Tony had found on the street one day, Figaro matured into a beautiful, playful fluffy boy. The Avengers Tower and Avengers Compound\u2019s furniture was thoroughly signed by endless claws marks coming from the sharp claws, the fur was flying in the air, and Figaro\u2019s strong, melodic meow and the sound of kitty paws running were well known to everyone. More time passed, and from a fluffy, robust ball of energy, Figaro mellowed into a regal adult, spending most of his days on naps and being pampered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, clean for the night,\u201d Steve announced, leaving the en suite bathroom, and pausing for a second while he saw Figaro already claiming his husband to himself. The possessive little creature still tended to sneak in while he was out of the bed to get the best spot. The best spot being next to Tony, of course. \u201cAlready here, huh?\u201d he asked, walking to the bed and lifting the covers up. He moved closer to Tony and joined in petting. \u201cHow does he do that?\u201d he asked, meaning the way Figaro was always showing up while he was out of the picture.</p><p>\u201cWho knows,\u201d Tony answered with a smile, leaning his head against Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd thanks, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day you will have to clean the litter box on your own, Tony,\u201d Steve answered, sounding exasperated. Since Figaro turned twelve years old he gradually started to have problems with jumping. All his favorite spots had to be brought lower and Tony kept a stool around their floor, just to help his friend to get to higher places he still had insisted on getting to. From his youngest years, Figaro had been taught to use the toilet for his kitty needs, but when the jumping problems started, to save Figaro stress, litter boxes started to appear. Luckily, Figaro knew right away what they were for, and Tony was beaming, once again claiming that his cat was the smartest. Steve wasn\u2019t beaming so much, realizing that once again all the dirty work would fall on him. Vet visits, claw trimming, now litter box - it was all on him, while Tony fed Figaro snacks and got all the love.</p><p>\u201cBut I did that when he was little,\u201d Tony whined playfully, reminiscing the first nights Figaro had spent as a kitten on their floor. It didn\u2019t take long until Tony taught Figaro how to use the toilet, but he couldn\u2019t unseen things from back then.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d Steve agreed, smiling to the memory. Twelve years had passed quickly. Many things had happened during that time, both sad and happy and it all lead them to this moment. Steve wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Feeling content, he kissed the top of his husband\u2019s head. \u201cLet\u2019s go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYhm,\u201d Tony agreed and took off his glasses, putting them on the night table. \u201cOh, did you give Figaro his vitamins today?\u201d he asked, hand reaching halfway to the lamp.</p><p>Steve huffed out a small laugh. \u201cAnd did you take your vitamins today?\u201d he asked back.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Tony answered immediately, sounding offended.</p><p>\u201cOh, you did?\u201d</p><p>The question was hanging in the air and Tony narrowed his eyes. \u201cDamn, you are good,\u201d he seethed out, his hand reaching into the drawer.</p><p>\u201cOnly because I love you,\u201d Steve hummed, kissing Tony\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Tony muttered, popping some pills into his mouth and swallowing.</p><p>\u201cWow, swallow it dry, huh?\u201d Steve asked, sounding unimpressed.</p><p>Tony grinned. \u201cI am a professional,\u201d as soon as he said that he gasped and covered Figaro\u2019s ears. \u201cNot in front of my son.\u201d</p><p>Steve laughed and rolled on his back, spreading on his side of the bed. \u201cYour son is an adult. In human years he is closer to my age than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is a nice change to be the youngest.\u201d</p><p>It was supposed to be a joke. Something in Tony\u2019s tone told Steve that it wasn\u2019t. He lay on his side and looked at Tony with concern before his face changed into a scolding one. \u201cBabe, don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not doing anything,\u201d Tony said, sounding somehow distant and running fingers through his hair. There were more and more silver streaks appearing among the brown ones, but Tony wasn\u2019t bothered that much. At this point, he was grateful his hair wasn\u2019t thinning out. He looked at Figaro curled in his lap and stroked the black fur. It felt soft and smooth and full, all thanks to the good food and a lot of care. Nothing could stop time, and some previously black hair turned gray, but they were scarce and barely noticeable among the fluff.

Nothing could stop time, and some previously black hair turned gray, but they were scarce and barely noticeable among the fluff. Still, in Tony&rsquo;s opinion, it didn&rsquo;t make Figaro any less charming. Steve was wondering when the same kind of philosophy Tony would apply to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to sleep, Tony,&rdquo; Steve reminded and turned the lights off. He waited for his husband to lower himself into the covers and gently slid Figaro off of his lap and to the middle of the bed. Steve put his head next to Tony&rsquo;s on the pillow, their legs entwining together. It was all the contact they could get with Figaro in between them, but after all those years, they got used to it. And they knew that there would come a day, they would miss their big cat taking half of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you, babe,&rdquo; Steve yawned. Proclaiming their love to each other every time before sleep was their small ritual, one they continued to do for as long as they remembered, no matter the distance or time difference. It was comforting for them both.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you back,&rdquo; Tony answered, always meaning it. &ldquo;Love you, Fig.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too, Fig,&rdquo; Steve cooed and petted the cat between them, and Figaro didn&rsquo;t say anything, but they could feel the love anyway. It was getting calm and sleepy, until -</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Steve&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered, aware that maybe his husband had already nodded off and he didn&rsquo;t want to disturb him.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm?&rdquo; Steve answered, and something in his voice told Tony that he wasn&rsquo;t that far in dreamland and he could continue. And Tony had some important question to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;You remember that day you found your first gray hair?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled into the pillow. &ldquo;How could I forget it,&rdquo; he laughed at the memory. It had happened a few years back, and Tony had walked on Steve sobbing on the bathroom floor, which scared the hell out of him. Turned out that the tears were from happiness, as Steve finally had a proof that his body was aging, it was just a slower process for him and he enthusiastically kept showing everyone his first silver hair among the dark blond strands. It was a hilariously, weird day and after the initial shock, Tony had fond memories of it.</p><p>&ldquo;You really scared me back then,&rdquo; Tony reminded with a pout.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny, it was the day I stopped being scared,&rdquo; Steve replied. Outliving his loved ones and being alone was one of his greatest fears and the single silver hair on his head put an end to it. It was such a relief. &ldquo;Who wants to live forever.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony hummed in understanding. &ldquo;I see your point, but I am kinda disappointed. I was getting used to the thought that my husband will be hot forever- AH!&rdquo; Tony yelped, suddenly yanked closer, &ldquo;no - wait! Fig&rsquo;s between us!&rdquo; he protested, but Figaro already evacuated himself to the calmer part of the bed. He still was quick and had enough of years of experience to know that whenever his blond human friend joined them in bed, some wrestling would happen. That&rsquo;s why he tried to have an earlier moment with his dark-haired human friend. A cat would think that humans were better at controlling themselves, but no. It was mating season all year round.</p><p>&ldquo;Fig&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nooo - Steve, ack! Wahahahit! Need to use the bathroom!&rdquo;</p><p>And the wrestling stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;What, again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fiiine,&rdquo; Steve rolled away and tucked hands underneath himself. For now. He watched Tony get up from the bed. &ldquo;You need to get that prostate exam done,&rdquo; Steve reminded in a harsh tone. Much to his dismay, Tony turned to him with a shining grin he could perfectly see in the darkness.</p><p>&ldquo;I rather have you exam my prostate,&rdquo; Tony purred out, a panicked yelp following when he saw Steve actually lifting himself up. Before Steve could sit, Tony already ran into the bathroom, and Steve sunk back into the covers with a quiet laugh. He stayed in the darkness and felt warm paws walking on him before a solid warm weight settled on his chest and green eyes looked at him. Just then Figaro pressed his head affectionately against Steve&rsquo;s forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, pal,&rdquo; Steve greeted, scratching Figaro behind the ear. Fig walked a customary circle on Steve&rsquo;s chest, before he curled into a big, fluffy ball, ready to sleep. As the petting continued, Figaro started to purr and it was a soothing sound. Then another sound joined when Tony decided to give an a cappella performance in his warm baritone, singing &rsquo;<i>who wants to be hot forever, Steve will be hot forever</i>&rsquo;, his own adaptation of one of the greatest music hits in history. Listening to his cat&rsquo;s purring and his cougar husband&rsquo;s singing, Steve closed eyes to sleep, thinking that having two senior cats in the house, wasn&rsquo;t so bad.<br /></p>",

His boyfriend of four years was meant to be coming home, permanently, next month, but, the wonderful, fantastic, abso-fucking-lutely spectacular army had sent him on a seven-week black spec-ops mission. Which meant that what Steve was going to do was incredibly dangerous and probably so secretive that if it failed (which it won\u2019t, because it\u2019s <em>Steve</em>) they would deny it ever existed and that he wasn\u2019t allowed any outside communication.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019ll be home before you know it,\u201d Steve says, crackly over the phone, because no-one had a webcam in the base he was in now, meaning, that <strike>if</strike> <em>when</em> he comes home, it\u2019ll be eight weeks, two whole months, since Tony\u2019s seen him in real-time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Tony mumbles, fiddling with Steve\u2019s hoodie strings, \u201cthat\u2019s what you said when you got deployed.\u201d</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><br/>\n\u201cWhat, the fuck, is this?\u201d Tony growls, slamming a letter, from the US Army, into Steve\u2019s chest.<br/>\nSteve steps back and lets the letter fall into his hands, he scans it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d Steve starts, reaching out tentatively to touch him but Tony moves back slightly, \u201cI had to.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t, Steve, it&ndash; college right? That\u2019s, that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to fight innocent people for this ass-backwards country. You know you\u2019re dating a billionaire right?\u201d Tony says hurt flashing in his eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI, Tony, you can\u2019t blame me for this, I was seventeen and poor, the Army, that they would pay for college, it was a blessing.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSteve, why didn\u2019t you say something, I could have&ndash;\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCould have what, Tony?\u201d Steve presses.</p>\n\n<p>Tony looks to the floor, lost for words, \u201cI, I don\u2019t know, but,\u201d he takes a deep breath, and Steve feels a cold sort of dread in the pit of his stomach, \u201cI, we, just, sleep on the couch, tonight, Steve, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve nods hesitantly, \u201cYeah, yeah, okay. Can, can I hug you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony steps forwards and wraps his arms tight around Steve\u2019s middle, holding on tighter when he practically melts into him, \u201cAre we ok?\u201d Steve asks tentatively.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Later, after Steve\u2019s read the letter so many times he could repeat it verbatim, when he\u2019s lying on the couch, staring up at the ceiling, nearing four am, Tony comes in, and Steve immediately slips his eyes shut and deepens his breathing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey, Steve, you still awake,\u201d Tony whispers, shaking his shoulder a little.<br/>\nSteve opens his eyes and sits up, \u201cYeah, honey, you okay?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Tony launches himself into Steve\u2019s arms and holds tightly, relishing in the way his thick arms wrapped around him and cards a hand through his hair, \u201cDarling, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Steve asks quietly, running a hand up and down his back.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Tony says in a broken whisper, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to die.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve pulls away a little to look Tony in the eye, \u201cI won\u2019t, Tony, sweetheart, I promise you&ndash;\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t Steve, please, don\u2019t, don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep,\u201d Tony says, blinking back tears.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI promise you, Tony Stark,\u201d Steve says, cupping his cheek, I will do anything and everything in my power to come back home to you, alive.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Steve kisses him softly and tenderly, \u201cIt\u2019ll be over before you know it, I\u2019m coming home, whatever it takes.\u201d<br/></p></blockquote>\u201cIt\u2019s not that long anymore, home stretch darling, God willing, I\u2019m coming home,\u201d Steve says, their \u2018one-minute warning\u2019 click going off half-way through his sentence.<br/>\nTony sighs, two years and he never got used to one hour going by faster than light, \u201cStay safe, baby, I love you,\u201d he says.\n\n<p>\u201cI always do, honey, I love you too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The line terminates and Tony\u2019s left wrapped in a hoodie that barely even smells of Steve anymore, staring at his desktop background - a picture of  him and Steve on their first anniversary at Coney Island, Steve\u2019s grinning to the camera, bright enough to power the entire universe, and Tony remembers turning his head at the last moment to kiss his cheek.</p>\n\n<p>Dum-e comes over and tries to comfort him with his claw - almost definitely JARVIS\u2019 work, but he appreciated it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d JARVIS says, soft, cutting through Tony\u2019s morose thoughts, \u201cI recommend you go to bed.\u201d Tony honestly can\u2019t tell how long he\u2019s been there, in his workshop, for, but <em>God</em>, his life must be sad if his own AI was judging him for moping after his deployed military boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Tony grumbles childishly, eyes fixated on the screen, \u201cyou can shove your recommendation in an if statement.\u201d It\u2019s not his best comeback, not by a long shot, but he\u2019s tired and sad damnit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d JARVIS says again, and if Tony didn\u2019t know any better he was being <em>disapproving</em>, Tony was absolutely positive that he hadn\u2019t coded that into him. <em>Huh.</em> </p>\n\n<p>\u201cGo to your room, or I will be forced to shut down your screens, Sir.\u201d<br/>\nTony glares up at the ceiling - a habit he picked up from Steve - and heaves himself out of his chair, \u201cYou know that I made you, I\u2019m the father here,\u201d he mumbles under his breath, as he gets into the elevator, automatically taking him up to his and Steve\u2019s floor, he\u2019s pretty sure that, whilst most of the world would be absolutely fucked if AIs tried to take over, he\u2019d be fairly well off if all JARVIS is trying to control is his health.</p>\n\n<p>He pushes the door to his room open, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to change out of his workshop clothes to sleep, yeah they were greasy and sweaty, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s got anyone to impress, right?</p>\n\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSurprise.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSteve?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony\u2019s speechless, because that can\u2019t be Steve Rogers, his boyfriend of four years, who isn\u2019t meant to be home for another two months, <em>on one knee, holding a ring, in their bedroom.</em> </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, baby,\u201d Steve says, eyes shining, hands steady holding the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Tony brings up a hand to his mouth, shaking, \u201cSteve,\u201d he chokes out again and Steve gets up, off the floor and curls his arm around Tony\u2019s waist.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTony, you&ndash; there\u2019s no else I want to come home to, for as long as I live, I want to spend the rest of it with you, it\u2019s always been you. Marry me?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re an asshole,\u201d Tony whispers, a grin threatening to take over his face as he throws himself into Steve\u2019s arms and burrows his face in his neck, breathing in deeply, \u201cyes, yes, I love you, yes,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n\n<p>Steve hold him even tighter and presses a kiss to the top of his head.</p>\n\n<p>After a long moment, they pull away, only to kiss, gently and tenderly, full of love and affection.

Marry me?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re an asshole,\u201d Tony whispers, a grin threatening to take over his face as he throws himself into Steve\u2019s arms and burrows his face in his neck, breathing in deeply, \u201cyes, yes, I love you, yes,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n\n<p>Steve hold him even tighter and presses a kiss to the top of his head.</p>\n\n<p>After a long moment, they pull away, only to kiss, gently and tenderly, full of love and affection. When they pull away again, they keep their foreheads touching, faces barely millimetres apart.</p>\n\n<p>Steve reaches for Tony\u2019s left hand, lifts it up and smoothly slides the ring on. He presses a kiss to his knuckles, keeping eye contact with him and smiling slightly. Tony slips his hand up to cup Steve\u2019s cheek and runs his thumb over his cheekbone, lingering over the trace of a bruise.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, baby, I\u2019m home forever now, no more getting hurt, I promise,\u201d Steve says softly, reassuringly, turning his head and pressing a kiss to his palm.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony murmurs, smiling as he leans up on his tiptoes and kisses Steve, \u201cyeah.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love you, darling, so much,\u201d Steve says, kissing Tony again, longer, deeper and hotter.</p>\n\n<p>Tony sighs into the kiss and jumps into his arms, wrapping his legs around his waist and his arms around his neck, \u201cGod, I missed you,\u201d he says, rocking his hips down. Steve supports him by holding his thighs, his fingers sinking in and biceps bunching up, he walks forwards so that Tony\u2019s pressed up against a wall.</p>\n\n<p>He breaks away from the kiss only to lick and kiss down Tony\u2019s neck, he latches onto the sensitive spot just under his ear and bites gently, grinning a little when he hears Tony gasp and rock down again, feeling his cock harden.</p>\n\n<p>Steve shifts him into one of his arms and Tony unashamedly moans at his show of strength and ducks his head down to press a series of kisses along his collar bone. Steve uses his free hand to undo both of their zippers and tug their hard, red cocks out and curls his hand around them.</p>\n\n<p>Tony groans into Steve\u2019s skin at the feeling of his long, warm fingers around him, \u201cBaby, honey, I\u2019m not gonna last,\u201d he gasps as Steve does something sinful with his thumb that makes stars and fireworks explode behind his eyelids.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, neither,\u201d Steve pants, dropping his head into the crook of Tony\u2019s neck, speeding up his hand. He presses a small, sweet kiss to the hollow of his collarbone, before murmuring, \u201cI love you, honey, god, I love you and I missed you so, so much, baby.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony\u2019s reduced to a babble of \u2018Steve\u2019 and moans, and he feels, somewhere, that he should be slightly ashamed that it\u2019s taken so little time for him to become like this, wanting and wanton, however, it\u2019s been so, so long and he\u2019s completely surrounded by Steve, by his body, arms, hands and smell, and he\u2019s not going anywhere anymore, and they\u2019re getting married, <em>God</em> he was so, so deeply in love with him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCome for me baby,\u201d Steve says, through a moan, kissing Tony and biting down on his lip, twisting his hand on the upstroke, as Tony comes and he follows seconds after, endorphins and pure love rushing through him as he holds onto Tony.</p>\n\n<p>Steve carries him to their bed and gently lowers him down. He lays down next to him and presses a kiss to his hair when Tony curls closer to him. \u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he whispers.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love you too, welcome home,\u201d Tony says, tiredly, leaning closer to him and he rests his head in his chest, letting his steady, beautiful heartbeat lull him into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>\n\n<p><i>tysm for reading!! <b><a href=\"https://nohalfway.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">tell me what you thought!</a></b> </i></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"%E2%80%9Chttps://nohalfway.tumblr.com/post/184175785061/fic-masterpost%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">all fic masterpost</a></b></p>",
