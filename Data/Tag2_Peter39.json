Simple as that. You knew you should have never said yes when Nate asked you to prom. You knew it was a dare but you thought you\u2019d at least get a fun night out of it, he paid for your ticket and bought a nice dinner but then he dropped you out of the cab you two took 2 miles away from your apartment and the school. So here you were in the freezing cold walking home in heels, a dress, and makeup. You had your phone and wallet but you didn\u2019t want to embarrass yourself anymore by calling someone to pick you up. You were pissed enough so you decided to punish yourself a bit more and walk the 45 minutes home. </p><p>\tPeter, MJ, and Ned told you not to go but you honestly had a plan. You\u2019d get free food, and chill with some of the other people you knew who were going and just completely blow Nate off and not even look at him the rest of the night but nope, here you were in one of the worst parts of New York at night after it had rained freezing. Whatever happened to living your best life? Oh right you lost your will to live when a jock pushed you out of a cab.</p><p>\tYour feet killed you, yet you still kept the heels on as you knew the weird ass shit that happened on these sidewalks, you\u2019d see tons of weirdos do crap on them. Thankfully you reached where you were going soon enough, you slipped the heels off and whimpered a bit seeing how red and a tad bit bloody they were. You climbed the fire escape until you reached the familiar bedroom you were looking for. You knocked on the window as you had no clue what the teen boy was doing. </p><p>\tAfter a few moments of no answer you pushed the window open and noticed his room was empty and you could hear the shower running in the distance. Deciding you didn\u2019t care about anything anymore you placed your heels at the window ledge and sat on his bed. His TV played the news so you just sat and watched for a little while whilst hugging a pillow. </p><p>\tSoon enough the shower stopped and you leaned into the pillow more, still entranced in the news. The door opened a bit later and you looked over. He hadn\u2019t noticed you yet but when he did his eyes went wide, and a small curse escaped his lips. You two stayed like that a few moments before he finally stepped in the room fully and you turned your attention to the TV again.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter asked as he tried to understand why you were here.</p><p>\t\u201cGot pushed out of a cab, walked here, watching the news.\u201d You stated simple as that.</p><p>\t\u201cWait what? Who pushed you out of a cab?\u201d Peter sta at the edge of the bed and looked at you, you still not paying a mind as to how this would be shocking for him. I mean it\u2019s just a normal Saturday for you apparently. </p><p>\t\u201cNate.\u201d You said simply as he gawked at you. \u201cCan I borrow your shower my mom told me not to come home until after midnight and I could really use one.\u201d He just nodded still looking at you not wanting to start an argument after he told you it was a bad idea to go to the prom, especially with Nate. \u00a0\u201cRad.\u201d you replied and grabbed some clothes from his dresser and went to the bathroom.</p><p>\tPeter sat there for a moment, he reveled in the fact you\u2019d been pushed out of a cab and walked here from wherever it was. To say Peter was pissed was an understatement, he was absolutely fumed. Who the hell would throw his Y/N out of a cab. He wanted to be pissed off, throw his suit on and show that douche what happens when you mess with his girl. That\u2019s when Peter realized he was not only angry, he was jealous. He was jealous that you looked absolutely stunning in that dress and he was pissed at himself for not asking you to go with him. You two had been friends for as long as he could remember and he\u2019d always loved you but he repressed those feeling until then, when you sat on his bed in his clothes looking like an absolute goddess. </p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you staring at doofus?\u201d You laughed a bit tying up your wet hair and leaning back curling up with his pillows. </p><p>\t\u201cThis is stupid but you looked absolutely beautiful tonight, I mean you still do but I just really had to tell you.\u201d Peter looked into your eyes and smiled, you stared into his chocolate eyes and smiled. You nudged you head over to your side and patted the bed next to you, he laughed a bit and crawled over. You cuddled into him and watched whatever was on. </p><p>As the hours past you two joked and laughed and randomly Peter stood up and played some random music he had cued up on his phone. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d He pulled his best Zac Efron and let his hand fall in front of him for you to take. You laughed and stood up grabbing his hand. He pulled you close and you leaned into him. Peter could feel the smile on your face and all you could do is just sway with him. </p><p>You two continued dancing even after the music stopped, you two were consumed in each other to the point it felt weird when you pulled away. Your arms were still wrapped around his neck but now you two were staring at each other. He slowly leaned in and you couldn\u2019t wait however long it would take for you two to finally meet so you grabbed his neck and pushed you two together. Kissing Peter was like finally breathing after being underwater for an eternity, and you couldn\u2019t get enough of it. </p><p>You two pulled apart momentarily and all you could do was smile and say \u201cso much better than a stupid ass prom night.\u201d You two both shared a laugh before he connected you lips again. </p>",

Simple as that. You knew you should have never said yes when Nate asked you to prom. You knew it was a dare but you thought you\u2019d at least get a fun night out of it, he paid for your ticket and bought a nice dinner but then he dropped you out of the cab you two took 2 miles away from your apartment and the school. So here you were in the freezing cold walking home in heels, a dress, and makeup. You had your phone and wallet but you didn\u2019t want to embarrass yourself anymore by calling someone to pick you up. You were pissed enough so you decided to punish yourself a bit more and walk the 45 minutes home. </p><p>\tPeter, MJ, and Ned told you not to go but you honestly had a plan. You\u2019d get free food, and chill with some of the other people you knew who were going and just completely blow Nate off and not even look at him the rest of the night but nope, here you were in one of the worst parts of New York at night after it had rained freezing. Whatever happened to living your best life? Oh right you lost your will to live when a jock pushed you out of a cab.</p><p>\tYour feet killed you, yet you still kept the heels on as you knew the weird ass shit that happened on these sidewalks, you\u2019d see tons of weirdos do crap on them. Thankfully you reached where you were going soon enough, you slipped the heels off and whimpered a bit seeing how red and a tad bit bloody they were. You climbed the fire escape until you reached the familiar bedroom you were looking for. You knocked on the window as you had no clue what the teen boy was doing. </p><p>\tAfter a few moments of no answer you pushed the window open and noticed his room was empty and you could hear the shower running in the distance. Deciding you didn\u2019t care about anything anymore you placed your heels at the window ledge and sat on his bed. His TV played the news so you just sat and watched for a little while whilst hugging a pillow. </p><p>\tSoon enough the shower stopped and you leaned into the pillow more, still entranced in the news. The door opened a bit later and you looked over. He hadn\u2019t noticed you yet but when he did his eyes went wide, and a small curse escaped his lips. You two stayed like that a few moments before he finally stepped in the room fully and you turned your attention to the TV again.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter asked as he tried to understand why you were here.</p><p>\t\u201cGot pushed out of a cab, walked here, watching the news.\u201d You stated simple as that.</p><p>\t\u201cWait what? Who pushed you out of a cab?\u201d Peter sta at the edge of the bed and looked at you, you still not paying a mind as to how this would be shocking for him. I mean it\u2019s just a normal Saturday for you apparently. </p><p>\t\u201cNate.\u201d You said simply as he gawked at you. \u201cCan I borrow your shower my mom told me not to come home until after midnight and I could really use one.\u201d He just nodded still looking at you not wanting to start an argument after he told you it was a bad idea to go to the prom, especially with Nate. \u00a0\u201cRad.\u201d you replied and grabbed some clothes from his dresser and went to the bathroom.</p><p>\tPeter sat there for a moment, he reveled in the fact you\u2019d been pushed out of a cab and walked here from wherever it was. To say Peter was pissed was an understatement, he was absolutely fumed. Who the hell would throw his Y/N out of a cab. He wanted to be pissed off, throw his suit on and show that douche what happens when you mess with his girl. That\u2019s when Peter realized he was not only angry, he was jealous. He was jealous that you looked absolutely stunning in that dress and he was pissed at himself for not asking you to go with him. You two had been friends for as long as he could remember and he\u2019d always loved you but he repressed those feeling until then, when you sat on his bed in his clothes looking like an absolute goddess. </p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you staring at doofus?\u201d You laughed a bit tying up your wet hair and leaning back curling up with his pillows. </p><p>\t\u201cThis is stupid but you looked absolutely beautiful tonight, I mean you still do but I just really had to tell you.\u201d Peter looked into your eyes and smiled, you stared into his chocolate eyes and smiled. You nudged you head over to your side and patted the bed next to you, he laughed a bit and crawled over. You cuddled into him and watched whatever was on. </p><p>As the hours past you two joked and laughed and randomly Peter stood up and played some random music he had cued up on his phone. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d He pulled his best Zac Efron and let his hand fall in front of him for you to take. You laughed and stood up grabbing his hand. He pulled you close and you leaned into him. Peter could feel the smile on your face and all you could do is just sway with him. </p><p>You two continued dancing even after the music stopped, you two were consumed in each other to the point it felt weird when you pulled away. Your arms were still wrapped around his neck but now you two were staring at each other. He slowly leaned in and you couldn\u2019t wait however long it would take for you two to finally meet so you grabbed his neck and pushed you two together. Kissing Peter was like finally breathing after being underwater for an eternity, and you couldn\u2019t get enough of it. </p><p>You two pulled apart momentarily and all you could do was smile and say \u201cso much better than a stupid ass prom night.\u201d You two both shared a laugh before he connected you lips again. </p>",

Not only had you been rehabilitated to a minor Avenger\u2019s compound. Yet Peter and you couldn\u2019t keep your hands off of one another, always shoulder to shoulder when making breakfast or you could be sitting in on different chairs, but your feet would be touching one way or another. Just barely. It was almost that: if you took your hands off the other, they\u2019d disappear again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they know how touchy they\u2019re being?\u201d Sam remarked to Bucky, watching Peter scroll through his phone while head resting on your lap. Just enjoying your company as you hummed to the music in your headphones.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother em\u2019.\u201d Bucky smiled at the small scene, turning away so Sam couldn\u2019t see the smile. \u201cThe kid\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>Yet the rest of the Avenger\u2019s only saw part of it, Peter and you were reserved during the day but at night you couldn\u2019t get any closer. You just wanted to be enveloped by him, arms and legs wrapped around each other; entangled like a knot.</p><p>\u201cI missed you Y/N.\u201d Peter mumbled; voice muffled as he buried his face into your hair</p><p>\u201cI know Peter,\u201d You giggle as you look up to face him, \u201cYou tell me every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you again.\u201d He gave his dorky Parker smile and showered your forehead with kisses before making his way down your face to your lips. Peter\u2019s kisses were always soft.</p><p>You smile as he parts this kiss and manoeuvre your face in the darkness of his bedroom to his neck, leaving small sleepy kisses there. Kissing for longer on certain parts of his neck you know makes him squirm. Without warning, Peter\u2019s positioning changed; allowing his hips to straddle yours while he kisses you lazily. One of your hands traces circles on his shirtless shoulder while the other lightly grips his hair for slight stability.</p><p>\u201cH-Hey Y/N.\u201d Peter broke apart from the kiss, his face looks nervous in what you could see in the dark room. \u201cD-do you want to uh uhm. Oh god. D-do you want to lose your virginity to me?\u201d</p><p>His voice is tired, shaky, and you could feel the heat coming off his blushing face. You gulp, you\u2019ve had this conversation before, pre-snap. You breathe out, glad it wasn\u2019t anything that bad.</p><p>\u201cYeah Pete.\u201d You bite your lip as you find your nerve. This would be a first for you and Peter, it was safe to say that you were both nervous as hell. \u201cI want you to be my first. Hopefully my only.\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t say anything; he can\u2019t but he can feel every hair standing up. He smiles and uses a hand to cup your cheek and place his forehead against yours. Allowing for him to place a kiss upon your lips; sealing some sort of loving deal between the two of you.</p><p>The kiss was not a battle between Peter and you, but it was unified and sought the closeness of sharing one breath, one passionate moment between two lovers. Peter was the first to start to take your clothes off, you were wearing one of his chemistry joke tees. Although couldn\u2019t see a lot in his dark bedroom in the compound, he couldn\u2019t help but admire your chest. No bra because it was night-time after all, so less work for Peter. When his lips connected to yours again, he began to work his way down your neck and to your breasts. Nipping slightly at your soft skin; letting you squeak out.</p><p>\u201cDid you not like that?\u201d Peter\u2019s up immediately, looking into your eyes for any sense of discomfort.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Pete- I liked it.\u201d You rub his hair for reassurance, but he still wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cI just got a fright,\u201d</p><p>Peter smirked a little at your reasoning before deeming it fine for him to continue. Letting his kisses go to your nipples before he kisses them softly, letting his tongue glide over the nub; eliciting a moan from you. Peter backs away again, amazed at just the sound of you.</p><p>\u201cHey- it\u2019s just me.\u201d You comfort him, your hands rubbing down his back for some comfort.</p><p>Peter goes to reply but shakes it off, trying not to get too in his head. He starts to hook his finger at the sides of your underwear, hitching a breath as he finds the strength to pull them off. Once you were fully naked, Peter couldn\u2019t help but just gawk at your body.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck. You\u2019re so beautiful Y/N.\u201d He gulps, you try to cover yourself in slight embarrassment but his body hovering over you prevented him from doing so.</p><p>To stop him staring you place a sweet kiss upon his lips and tug at the waistband of his boxer shorts. He shivers at you touch but sits up a little so you can continue pulling them down. When you got to a point you couldn\u2019t pull anymore; Peter finished the job and tugged them off completely. You didn\u2019t know what to think of his size as he was your first but to you; It was pretty big.</p><p>\u201cWait-\u201c Peter\u2019s warmth is removed from you as he leans over to his bedside table. He pulls out a condom packet and struggles a little to tear it but finally finds the right part and he does his best to slide it along his length.</p><p>As Peter positions himself over you, he rubs the head of his length up and down your slick folds, wanting to hear you moan his name. When you do, you hear a little grunt from him in return. It takes him a minute to find your entrance before slowly pushing himself inside of you.

Not only had you been rehabilitated to a minor Avenger\u2019s compound. Yet Peter and you couldn\u2019t keep your hands off of one another, always shoulder to shoulder when making breakfast or you could be sitting in on different chairs, but your feet would be touching one way or another. Just barely. It was almost that: if you took your hands off the other, they\u2019d disappear again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they know how touchy they\u2019re being?\u201d Sam remarked to Bucky, watching Peter scroll through his phone while head resting on your lap. Just enjoying your company as you hummed to the music in your headphones.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother em\u2019.\u201d Bucky smiled at the small scene, turning away so Sam couldn\u2019t see the smile. \u201cThe kid\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>Yet the rest of the Avenger\u2019s only saw part of it, Peter and you were reserved during the day but at night you couldn\u2019t get any closer. You just wanted to be enveloped by him, arms and legs wrapped around each other; entangled like a knot.</p><p>\u201cI missed you Y/N.\u201d Peter mumbled; voice muffled as he buried his face into your hair</p><p>\u201cI know Peter,\u201d You giggle as you look up to face him, \u201cYou tell me every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you again.\u201d He gave his dorky Parker smile and showered your forehead with kisses before making his way down your face to your lips. Peter\u2019s kisses were always soft.</p><p>You smile as he parts this kiss and manoeuvre your face in the darkness of his bedroom to his neck, leaving small sleepy kisses there. Kissing for longer on certain parts of his neck you know makes him squirm. Without warning, Peter\u2019s positioning changed; allowing his hips to straddle yours while he kisses you lazily. One of your hands traces circles on his shirtless shoulder while the other lightly grips his hair for slight stability.</p><p>\u201cH-Hey Y/N.\u201d Peter broke apart from the kiss, his face looks nervous in what you could see in the dark room. \u201cD-do you want to uh uhm. Oh god. D-do you want to lose your virginity to me?\u201d</p><p>His voice is tired, shaky, and you could feel the heat coming off his blushing face. You gulp, you\u2019ve had this conversation before, pre-snap. You breathe out, glad it wasn\u2019t anything that bad.</p><p>\u201cYeah Pete.\u201d You bite your lip as you find your nerve. This would be a first for you and Peter, it was safe to say that you were both nervous as hell. \u201cI want you to be my first. Hopefully my only.\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t say anything; he can\u2019t but he can feel every hair standing up. He smiles and uses a hand to cup your cheek and place his forehead against yours. Allowing for him to place a kiss upon your lips; sealing some sort of loving deal between the two of you.</p><p>The kiss was not a battle between Peter and you, but it was unified and sought the closeness of sharing one breath, one passionate moment between two lovers. Peter was the first to start to take your clothes off, you were wearing one of his chemistry joke tees. Although couldn\u2019t see a lot in his dark bedroom in the compound, he couldn\u2019t help but admire your chest. No bra because it was night-time after all, so less work for Peter. When his lips connected to yours again, he began to work his way down your neck and to your breasts. Nipping slightly at your soft skin; letting you squeak out.</p><p>\u201cDid you not like that?\u201d Peter\u2019s up immediately, looking into your eyes for any sense of discomfort.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Pete- I liked it.\u201d You rub his hair for reassurance, but he still wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cI just got a fright,\u201d</p><p>Peter smirked a little at your reasoning before deeming it fine for him to continue. Letting his kisses go to your nipples before he kisses them softly, letting his tongue glide over the nub; eliciting a moan from you. Peter backs away again, amazed at just the sound of you.</p><p>\u201cHey- it\u2019s just me.\u201d You comfort him, your hands rubbing down his back for some comfort.</p><p>Peter goes to reply but shakes it off, trying not to get too in his head. He starts to hook his finger at the sides of your underwear, hitching a breath as he finds the strength to pull them off. Once you were fully naked, Peter couldn\u2019t help but just gawk at your body.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck. You\u2019re so beautiful Y/N.\u201d He gulps, you try to cover yourself in slight embarrassment but his body hovering over you prevented him from doing so.</p><p>To stop him staring you place a sweet kiss upon his lips and tug at the waistband of his boxer shorts. He shivers at you touch but sits up a little so you can continue pulling them down. When you got to a point you couldn\u2019t pull anymore; Peter finished the job and tugged them off completely. You didn\u2019t know what to think of his size as he was your first but to you; It was pretty big.</p><p>\u201cWait-\u201c Peter\u2019s warmth is removed from you as he leans over to his bedside table. He pulls out a condom packet and struggles a little to tear it but finally finds the right part and he does his best to slide it along his length.</p><p>As Peter positions himself over you, he rubs the head of his length up and down your slick folds, wanting to hear you moan his name.

Not only had you been rehabilitated to a minor Avenger&rsquo;s compound. Yet Peter and you couldn&rsquo;t keep your hands off of one another, always shoulder to shoulder when making breakfast or you could be sitting in on different chairs, but your feet would be touching one way or another. Just barely. It was almost that: if you took your hands off the other, they&rsquo;d disappear again.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think they know how touchy they&rsquo;re being?&rdquo; Sam remarked to Bucky, watching Peter scroll through his phone while head resting on your lap. Just enjoying your company as you hummed to the music in your headphones.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother em&rsquo;.&rdquo; Bucky smiled at the small scene, turning away so Sam couldn&rsquo;t see the smile. &ldquo;The kid&rsquo;s happy.&rdquo;</p><p>Yet the rest of the Avenger&rsquo;s only saw part of it, Peter and you were reserved during the day but at night you couldn&rsquo;t get any closer. You just wanted to be enveloped by him, arms and legs wrapped around each other; entangled like a knot.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you Y/N.&rdquo; Peter mumbled; voice muffled as he buried his face into your hair</p><p>&ldquo;I know Peter,&rdquo; You giggle as you look up to face him, &ldquo;You tell me every night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to tell you again.&rdquo; He gave his dorky Parker smile and showered your forehead with kisses before making his way down your face to your lips. Peter&rsquo;s kisses were always soft.</p><p>You smile as he parts this kiss and manoeuvre your face in the darkness of his bedroom to his neck, leaving small sleepy kisses there. Kissing for longer on certain parts of his neck you know makes him squirm. Without warning, Peter&rsquo;s positioning changed; allowing his hips to straddle yours while he kisses you lazily. One of your hands traces circles on his shirtless shoulder while the other lightly grips his hair for slight stability.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Hey Y/N.&rdquo; Peter broke apart from the kiss, his face looks nervous in what you could see in the dark room. &ldquo;D-do you want to uh uhm. Oh god. D-do you want to lose your virginity to me?&rdquo;</p><p>His voice is tired, shaky, and you could feel the heat coming off his blushing face. You gulp, you&rsquo;ve had this conversation before, pre-snap. You breathe out, glad it wasn&rsquo;t anything that bad.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Pete.&rdquo; You bite your lip as you find your nerve. This would be a first for you and Peter, it was safe to say that you were both nervous as hell. &ldquo;I want you to be my first. Hopefully my only.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t say anything; he can&rsquo;t but he can feel every hair standing up. He smiles and uses a hand to cup your cheek and place his forehead against yours. Allowing for him to place a kiss upon your lips; sealing some sort of loving deal between the two of you.</p><p>The kiss was not a battle between Peter and you, but it was unified and sought the closeness of sharing one breath, one passionate moment between two lovers. Peter was the first to start to take your clothes off, you were wearing one of his chemistry joke tees. Although couldn&rsquo;t see a lot in his dark bedroom in the compound, he couldn&rsquo;t help but admire your chest. No bra because it was night-time after all, so less work for Peter. When his lips connected to yours again, he began to work his way down your neck and to your breasts. Nipping slightly at your soft skin; letting you squeak out.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you not like that?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s up immediately, looking into your eyes for any sense of discomfort.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright Pete- I liked it.&rdquo; You rub his hair for reassurance, but he still wasn&rsquo;t convinced. &ldquo;I just got a fright,&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smirked a little at your reasoning before deeming it fine for him to continue. Letting his kisses go to your nipples before he kisses them softly, letting his tongue glide over the nub; eliciting a moan from you. Peter backs away again, amazed at just the sound of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey- it&rsquo;s just me.&rdquo; You comfort him, your hands rubbing down his back for some comfort.</p><p>Peter goes to reply but shakes it off, trying not to get too in his head. He starts to hook his finger at the sides of your underwear, hitching a breath as he finds the strength to pull them off. Once you were fully naked, Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but just gawk at your body.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy fuck. You&rsquo;re so beautiful Y/N.&rdquo; He gulps, you try to cover yourself in slight embarrassment but his body hovering over you prevented him from doing so.</p><p>To stop him staring you place a sweet kiss upon his lips and tug at the waistband of his boxer shorts. He shivers at you touch but sits up a little so you can continue pulling them down. When you got to a point you couldn&rsquo;t pull anymore; Peter finished the job and tugged them off completely. You didn&rsquo;t know what to think of his size as he was your first but to you; It was pretty big.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait-&ldquo; Peter&rsquo;s warmth is removed from you as he leans over to his bedside table. He pulls out a condom packet and struggles a little to tear it but finally finds the right part and he does his best to slide it along his length.</p><p>As Peter positions himself over you, he rubs the head of his length up and down your slick folds, wanting to hear you moan his name. When you do, you hear a little grunt from him in return. It takes him a minute to find your entrance before slowly pushing himself inside of you. You gasp at the slight pain of him inside you, but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt it just feels unknown.</p><p>&ldquo;W-wait.&rdquo; You ask of him, grasping at his biceps as he darts his look towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I hurting you?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s so worried, but after you explain to him that you need to adjust, he goes by your feeling until he&rsquo;s completely inside of you.</p><p>As he begins to move you can&rsquo;t help but moan at Peter&rsquo;s every move, but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to Peter who was moaning deliciously but it was far too loud. You hold your hand over his mouth for a second to allow for him to realise that he was being too noisy before connected your lips with his. Peter&rsquo;s thrusts started to become faster and deeper as gaged your reactions.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shi-it Peter don&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo; You practically melted into him and his little smile at your encouragement sent him ablaze. His hands turn to your thighs, grabbing them tight as he rocks his hips into you. Maybe he was gripping you too tightly, as you realised his super-strength had begun to kick in you tapped his hand lightly to which he took note of and loosened his grip.</p><p>Before long, Peter&rsquo;s thrusts began to get sloppier. His grip went from your thighs to your waist and he began to kiss you once again. Just softly, long enough that he could feel his breath on yours. Until he finally finished, trying to not let himself fall on you as his muscles felt weak.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Peter mumbled, upon the fact that he didn&rsquo;t wait for you.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Pete.&rdquo; You giggle breathlessly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a little excited- we both are.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t make haste to getting rid of the used condom, his fingers trail down your navel and he strokes a finger along your clit.

Once again the intoxicating feeling of lust washes over you and it doesn&rsquo;t take Peter long with his magical Spider-man fingers to have you feeling electricity as you orgasm.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy fuck-&rdquo; You stutter as he heads back up to the top of the bed, allowing for the two of you to envelope one another again.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; Peter whispers, pressing a kiss to your forehead as he holds you tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Peter.&rdquo; You coo. &ldquo;Wait- where&rsquo;d you get those condoms?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark gave me a pep talk.&rdquo; Peter admits embarrassingly, you laugh but end up falling asleep in his muscular arms.</p><p>The next morning the two of you got hastily dressed, you mainly in Peter&rsquo;s clothes and Peter in something baggy and cosy.
