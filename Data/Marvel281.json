Her head was pounding and she felt a bit sore, but other than that, she felt perfectly fine. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know that superhero that lives around here? Spider-Man?\u201d her mother asked, looking up from the screen. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N nodded. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe pulled you out of the building,\u201d she said, voice unemotional. \u201cYou were the last one in there.

Luckily, there\u2019s no permanent damage. You might be coughing for a while, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The way she said it all made it sound so small. So matter-of-fact and unimportant\u2013just a minor inconvenience that had already passed. </p>\n\n<p>But she had almost died. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N L/N had almost burned to death in a library, had almost ceased existing, and here her own mother was, not shedding a tear. </p>\n\n<p>And for that moment, as her mother turned back to her computer, Y/N had to wonder if anyone would have cared if she really had died. </p>\n\n<p>\u2013</p>\n\n<p>Y/N returned to school on Monday, as if nothing ever happened. She had some bruises that ached, some cuts still covered in bandaids, but no one bothered to ask her about any of it. </p>\n\n<p>At lunch, her and MJ sat at their normal spot. Lunch was better now that she had MJ. Sometimes, they\u2019d sit and complain about teachers, talk about how stupid other students could be, or sometimes, MJ would just draw and Y/N would read. They\u2019d be in their own worlds, but even then they had each other. As they sat, Y/N spoke. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo I kinda almost died.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>MJ didn\u2019t even flinch as she plopped her sketchbook onto the table in a very MJ-like matter. \u201cYeah?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYep. Spider-Man saved me.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>She gave a small hum. \u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t die because I\u2019d have to go back to those losers.\u201d She jerked her head toward Peter and Ned. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N chuckled. \u201cI guess we both have Spider-Man to thank for saving us from those awful fates.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>MJ gave a small smile, lifting her carton of milk. \u201cTo Spider-Man.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Y/N grinned, lifting her own. \u201cTo Spider-Man.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u2013</p>\n\n<p>Peter hadn\u2019t been able to get his mind off of Y/N, with was fairly reasonable based on his latest discovery. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N L/N was his soulmate. </p>\n\n<p>Part of him felt that he knew it all along, the other still sat in disbelief, waiting for someone to jump out and yell \u201cGotcha!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>But that didn\u2019t happen. </p>\n\n<p>He had looked down at that matching mark and panicked\u2013even more than he had been before. The life of his soulmate was literally in his own hands, and he didn\u2019t want to lose her. </p>\n\n<p>It was only after he knew she was safe at the hospital that his mind fully began to register the facts. His soulmate had almost died. He saved his soulmate\u2019s life. </p>\n\n<p>His soulmate freaking HATED him. </p>\n\n<p>And so, Monday at school, he realized he had two options. One: talk to her. Risk being even more hated and ruin everything. Or two: ignore it. Just keep living like normal and avoid her at all costs and hope fate found a way to bring them together. </p>\n\n<p>He was seriously considering that second option and just never telling anyone what he had discovered, but as school let out that day and he put on his Spider-Man suit, he realized that maybe, just maybe, he had a third option\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u2013</p>\n\n<p>Boring. </p>\n\n<p>That was the word Y/N would use to describe her life up to this point.

She went to nice schools and got to learn some cool stuff. But she heard other people\u2019s stories, the experiences they had, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel inadequate. </p>\n\n<p>Her mother never paid attention to her longer than a minute at a time, eyes glued to that life-consuming device. Her father had been out of the picture for as long as she cared to remember. Her cousins and family lived much too far to travel, and, well, MJ was still the only person who willingly talk to her. It didn\u2019t help that her soulmate didn\u2019t bother to present himself. </p>\n\n<p>Gazing in the mirror, she knew she even looked boring. Hair hardly done and makeup at the minimal. Clothes just nice enough to be looked over in a crowd. And her eyes were brown. </p>\n\n<p>Brown is freaking boring. </p>\n\n<p>And as she laid in bed, every single one of these thoughts were running through her head on repeat. She wanted something to change, but that pessimistic part of her knew it wouldn\u2019t.

I\u2019d just like to say thank you to all the support I\u2019ve received so far! I\u2019ve only had this blog for about a month, so it means a lot! </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d also like to let you know that if you want to be tagged in either this series or all of my writing, send me a message or ask and I\u2019ll add you! </p>\n\n<p>TAG LIST OPEN</p>\n\n<p>REQUESTS OPEN </p>\n\n<p>\u2013</p>\n\n<p>When Y/N woke up, the white nearly blinded her. </p>\n\n<p>Squinting, she observed the room the best she could, trying to remember the last thing that happened. She had been at he library, and then\u2026 Then the explosion. The shelves shook and fell, the air filled with smoke, and\u2026 and\u2026</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s where it all blurred. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d a voice said. Y/N turned to see her mother, computer in her lap. </p>\n\n<p>Typical. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow\u2026 What..?\u201d It was only when Y/N tried talking that she realized how raw her throat was\u2013likely from the smoke. Her head was pounding and she felt a bit sore, but other than that, she felt perfectly fine. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know that superhero that lives around here? Spider-Man?\u201d her mother asked, looking up from the screen. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N nodded. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe pulled you out of the building,\u201d she said, voice unemotional. \u201cYou were the last one in there. Everyone else was able to run, but because the shelves fell on you, you couldn\u2019t get out.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Silence laid heavy in the room. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe saved my life,\u201d Y/N mumbled. </p>\n\n<p>Her mother nodded. \u201cHe took you straight to the hospital. Luckily, there\u2019s no permanent damage. You might be coughing for a while, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The way she said it all made it sound so small. So matter-of-fact and unimportant\u2013just a minor inconvenience that had already passed. </p>\n\n<p>But she had almost died. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N L/N had almost burned to death in a library, had almost ceased existing, and here her own mother was, not shedding a tear. </p>\n\n<p>And for that moment, as her mother turned back to her computer, Y/N had to wonder if anyone would have cared if she really had died. </p>\n\n<p>\u2013</p>\n\n<p>Y/N returned to school on Monday, as if nothing ever happened. She had some bruises that ached, some cuts still covered in bandaids, but no one bothered to ask her about any of it. </p>\n\n<p>At lunch, her and MJ sat at their normal spot. Lunch was better now that she had MJ. Sometimes, they\u2019d sit and complain about teachers, talk about how stupid other students could be, or sometimes, MJ would just draw and Y/N would read. They\u2019d be in their own worlds, but even then they had each other. As they sat, Y/N spoke. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo I kinda almost died.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>MJ didn\u2019t even flinch as she plopped her sketchbook onto the table in a very MJ-like matter. \u201cYeah?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYep. Spider-Man saved me.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>She gave a small hum. \u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t die because I\u2019d have to go back to those losers.\u201d She jerked her head toward Peter and Ned. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N chuckled. \u201cI guess we both have Spider-Man to thank for saving us from those awful fates.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>MJ gave a small smile, lifting her carton of milk. \u201cTo Spider-Man.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Y/N grinned, lifting her own. \u201cTo Spider-Man.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u2013</p>\n\n<p>Peter hadn\u2019t been able to get his mind off of Y/N, with was fairly reasonable based on his latest discovery. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N L/N was his soulmate. </p>\n\n<p>Part of him felt that he knew it all along, the other still sat in disbelief, waiting for someone to jump out and yell \u201cGotcha!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>But that didn\u2019t happen. </p>\n\n<p>He had looked down at that matching mark and panicked\u2013even more than he had been before. The life of his soulmate was literally in his own hands, and he didn\u2019t want to lose her. </p>\n\n<p>It was only after he knew she was safe at the hospital that his mind fully began to register the facts. His soulmate had almost died. He saved his soulmate\u2019s life. </p>\n\n<p>His soulmate freaking HATED him. </p>\n\n<p>And so, Monday at school, he realized he had two options. One: talk to her. Risk being even more hated and ruin everything. Or two: ignore it. Just keep living like normal and avoid her at all costs and hope fate found a way to bring them together. </p>\n\n<p>He was seriously considering that second option and just never telling anyone what he had discovered, but as school let out that day and he put on his Spider-Man suit, he realized that maybe, just maybe, he had a third option\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u2013</p>\n\n<p>Boring. </p>\n\n<p>That was the word Y/N would use to describe her life up to this point. Others she would use included pointless, lacking, and unwanted. But all in all, the best word was still that one. Boring. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, she lived in New York City, the Big Apple. She went to nice schools and got to learn some cool stuff. But she heard other people\u2019s stories, the experiences they had, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel inadequate. </p>\n\n<p>Her mother never paid attention to her longer than a minute at a time, eyes glued to that life-consuming device. Her father had been out of the picture for as long as she cared to remember. Her cousins and family lived much too far to travel, and, well, MJ was still the only person who willingly talk to her. It didn\u2019t help that her soulmate didn\u2019t bother to present himself. </p>\n\n<p>Gazing in the mirror, she knew she even looked boring. Hair hardly done and makeup at the minimal. Clothes just nice enough to be looked over in a crowd. And her eyes were brown. </p>\n\n<p>Brown is freaking boring. </p>\n\n<p>And as she laid in bed, every single one of these thoughts were running through her head on repeat. She wanted something to change, but that pessimistic part of her knew it wouldn\u2019t. She was destined to be boring. </p>\n\n<p>All of those thoughts were chased away with the sound of tapping on her window. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014</p>\n\n<p>A/N: Sorry this chapter is kinda a disaster but whatever </p>\n\n<p>Boring Tag list:</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2A5hP_yFWgXsCAXfXZ7WBw\">@tom-hollands-eyelash</a></p>\n\n<p>Tag list: </p>\n\n<p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mylVR9EUR1f_B6fqn71tejQ\">@fireboltrose7559</a></p>",
