I\u2019m pretty sure she will be darker than self-harm in this season.

Really loving Carolyn&ndash;and Fiona Shaw in this role&ndash;and I feel like the initial intrigue of the season will center around her: How much does she know? What is her angle in regards to keeping Eve in the game? What is her goal? Did she and Julia have an affair with one another and, if not, why not? I don\u2019t necessarily feel eager for next week, but I look forward to seeing a plot ramp up. Season 1 was really paced kinda breakneck and I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019re going to try to match that pace or if this is gonna slow down.</li><li>Yellow titles for the first time? The show looks as slick as ever. Love the music still.</li><li>Loved small details of the episode: The blood on the rail, the domesticity of the Polastri household like we see Eve folding laundry, the crocks being just a little too small (lol), that the taxi cab driver is an immigrant to France, Oliver lol, how they\u2019re giving Jodie more foreign language dialogue than she\u2019s probably comfortable with?</li><li>Shout out to Sandra Oh, too, for being able to tap back into that mindset of panic and shock after a hiatus. That\u2019s jumping back into a season going 100 mph. Also the way that Oh transitioned out of the fugue via getting pulled back into the thrill of the chase? Eve is not a substance abuser in the way the stranger interpreted her to be an addict, but she is addicted to true crime and chasing and unraveling those puzzles&ndash;she gazed into that abyss, the abyss gazed back and threatened to consume her, but her mind and her interests are simply wired to engage them. The puzzle is a distraction from one thing, but it\u2019s also the drug that intoxicates Eve and reels her in further than she can recognize. I loved the coverage of Carolyn enjoying watching Eve getting lured back into the rabbit hole, that smile when Carolyn sees the gears start turning in Eve\u2019s mind. I don\u2019t know why Carolyn wants Eve at this point&ndash;what she wants Eve to do&ndash;but there\u2019s something vicarious in the way that Carolyn feeds Eve bait to light her up.</li><li>I am frustrated that both Carolyn and Eve asked questions of one another that no one even remotely answered.</li><li>I do have some questions, like if Villanelle\u2019s reaction to the stabbing&ndash;interpreting the stabbing as an act of love, was always in the cards with the writing of the finale of Season 1 or if that was a development that came with breaking Season 2 in the writers\u2019 room?\u00a0</li><li>The episode kind of felt humdrum&ndash;because the pacing was so much slower than usual and kind of low energy because Villanelle is injured and Eve is in shock and trying to process what happened in Paris&ndash;but then the show threw that curve ball of Villanelle snapping Gabriel\u2019s and I was right back in that thrill of the show of having been plunged into shock. I think it\u2019s interesting, too, that Villanelle probably saw her actions as an act of kindness? It was what Gabriel said he wanted, it was more merciful in her POV to be dead than to live forever in that state (because it\u00a0\u201cwould be shit\u201d)&ndash;and thus that opens an interesting can of worms because while murder is murder, Villanelle\u2019s motivations kinda makes us reevaluate her. Her solutions/thinking/rationale/conclusions are off-base in terms of what we\u2019d view as the\u00a0\u201cnorm\u201d and the social contract, but that\u2019s a different place for her to come from (as opposed to acting selfishly, as she does at every other point of this episode), and so that\u2019s an interesting&hellip; start? Villanelle has a lot of self-awareness. Her dialogue is very bald and straightforward on this point. So I do wonder about this\u00a0\u201cmercy\u201d kill. It\u2019s not out of character; she killed promised to kill what\u2019s-his-face, Eve\u2019s boss, quickly. Like I guess I wonder if there\u2019s any emotion in the action or what? I mean, you need only look at how Eve has reacted to stabbing Villanelle to how perfunctorily and casually Villanelle made the decision to end Gabriel\u2019s life.</li><li>Similarly, when the woman at the bar started talking to Eve, I was like: Who does that? Maybe that didn\u2019t strike others as strange, which means some of y\u2019all are way kinder and compassionate than I am.</li><li>That said, I saw absolutely zero reason why Gabriel would have helped her out initially. I didn\u2019t buy it. But I do find it interesting that the people whose kindness that Villanelle preys on this episode are men.\u00a0</li><li>I feel bad for Niko. I\u2019ve always felt bad for Niko. His side of the story is legit and it\u2019s hard watching him to try to navigate a marriage in which Eve is not gonna meet him halfway&ndash;and Carolyn serves as the model of BSing your spouse in order to pursue your real passion (and maybe duty, but really Carolyn and Eve and their ilk are compelled to go after these mysteries). In fact, it\u2019s super interesting to think that Villanelle posed as a victim of domestic violence and yet&hellip; you know&hellip; Eve has committed domestic violence. She slapped Niko. Niko is so friggin\u2019 understanding considering the degree of shit Eve has put him through. Ugh, I feel bad for him.</li><li>Not directly related to the show: Amazon\u2019s captions are driving me crazy.

Eve is not a substance abuser in the way the stranger interpreted her to be an addict, but she is addicted to true crime and chasing and unraveling those puzzles\u2013she gazed into that abyss, the abyss gazed back and threatened to consume her, but her mind and her interests are simply wired to engage them. The puzzle is a distraction from one thing, but it\u2019s also the drug that intoxicates Eve and reels her in further than she can recognize. I loved the coverage of Carolyn enjoying watching Eve getting lured back into the rabbit hole, that smile when Carolyn sees the gears start turning in Eve\u2019s mind. I don\u2019t know why Carolyn wants Eve at this point\u2013what she wants Eve to do\u2013but there\u2019s something vicarious in the way that Carolyn feeds Eve bait to light her up.</li><li>I am frustrated that both Carolyn and Eve asked questions of one another that no one even remotely answered.</li><li>I do have some questions, like if Villanelle\u2019s reaction to the stabbing\u2013interpreting the stabbing as an act of love, was always in the cards with the writing of the finale of Season 1 or if that was a development that came with breaking Season 2 in the writers\u2019 room?\u00a0</li><li>The episode kind of felt humdrum\u2013because the pacing was so much slower than usual and kind of low energy because Villanelle is injured and Eve is in shock and trying to process what happened in Paris\u2013but then the show threw that curve ball of Villanelle snapping Gabriel\u2019s and I was right back in that thrill of the show of having been plunged into shock. I think it\u2019s interesting, too, that Villanelle probably saw her actions as an act of kindness? It was what Gabriel said he wanted, it was more merciful in her POV to be dead than to live forever in that state (because it\u00a0\u201cwould be shit\u201d)\u2013and thus that opens an interesting can of worms because while murder is murder, Villanelle\u2019s motivations kinda makes us reevaluate her. Her solutions/thinking/rationale/conclusions are off-base in terms of what we\u2019d view as the\u00a0\u201cnorm\u201d and the social contract, but that\u2019s a different place for her to come from (as opposed to acting selfishly, as she does at every other point of this episode), and so that\u2019s an interesting\u2026 start? Villanelle has a lot of self-awareness. Her dialogue is very bald and straightforward on this point. So I do wonder about this\u00a0\u201cmercy\u201d kill. It\u2019s not out of character; she killed promised to kill what\u2019s-his-face, Eve\u2019s boss, quickly. Like I guess I wonder if there\u2019s any emotion in the action or what? I mean, you need only look at how Eve has reacted to stabbing Villanelle to how perfunctorily and casually Villanelle made the decision to end Gabriel\u2019s life.</li><li>Similarly, when the woman at the bar started talking to Eve, I was like: Who does that? Maybe that didn\u2019t strike others as strange, which means some of y\u2019all are way kinder and compassionate than I am.</li><li>That said, I saw absolutely zero reason why Gabriel would have helped her out initially. I didn\u2019t buy it. But I do find it interesting that the people whose kindness that Villanelle preys on this episode are men.\u00a0</li><li>I feel bad for Niko. I\u2019ve always felt bad for Niko. His side of the story is legit and it\u2019s hard watching him to try to navigate a marriage in which Eve is not gonna meet him halfway\u2013and Carolyn serves as the model of BSing your spouse in order to pursue your real passion (and maybe duty, but really Carolyn and Eve and their ilk are compelled to go after these mysteries). In fact, it\u2019s super interesting to think that Villanelle posed as a victim of domestic violence and yet\u2026 you know\u2026 Eve has committed domestic violence. She slapped Niko. Niko is so friggin\u2019 understanding considering the degree of shit Eve has put him through. Ugh, I feel bad for him.</li><li>Not directly related to the show: Amazon\u2019s captions are driving me crazy.
