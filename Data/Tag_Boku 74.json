She claps her hands together and grins nice and wide. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure when you\u2019d be arriving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that, I texted Mezo but I don\u2019t think he saw it.\u201d Sheepishly you rub the back of your head, your other hand occupied with the plastic bag you\u2019d carried over from your place to his.</p><p>\u201cNo worries!\u201d She steps aside. \u201cCome on in. He\u2019s just resting up for now, you can go right in.\u201d</p><p>Your brows knit. \u201cWould he be fine if I just\u2026 Walked in?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Shouji shuts the door and follows behind you as you wander to the kitchen, hoist your bag up and set it on the counter. As she helps you unwrap a very well packaged container of soup, she giggles.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s you coming in I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be alright. Just don\u2019t jump on him- he\u2019s a confused waker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d The idea of Shouji awakening with that blurry, momentary confusion is a fun one to play with. Messy hair, glazed over eyes, those pensive brows. Internally you fawn over him. \u201cThanks for letting me over, by the way. Is he doing any better?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Shouji sighs and slumps her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Yesterday he was up to eat dinner but he headed right back to sleep after he was done. Hopefully it just stays at a fever and nothing else developes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be scary\u2026 Hopefully this helps him feel better, even if it\u2019s just by a little bit. I hate to see him unwell\u2026\u201d</p><p>One of her hands reaches out, touches at your shoulder. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m glad he has you.\u201d</p><p>Her statement, albeit harmless, makes you flush. This would surely be a moment that Shouji would internally gush over- his mother openly approving of you, supporting you. Even without him you feel the pride bubbling in your chest. </p><p>\u201cT-Thank you, so much, that seriously means a lot.\u201d You smile.</p><p>\u201cNo need to thank me,\u201d She turns around and retrieves a bowl from the cupboard, pours the soup from the plastic container and hands it back to you after settling a spoon in the broth. \u201cJust tell him mom says \u2018hi\u2019 when you go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d  Nodding eagerly, you hold the bowl. You take your leave from the kitchen and wander down the hallway to his room, stand outside and stop for just a moment. Even with his mother&rsquo;s blessing, you still feel strange just\u2026 Barging in without his permission. You\u2019d wished he would have send you a confirmation message that he knew you were coming, even if it was nothing more than just a random emoji. As you reach out you hope that he doesn\u2019t get all sorts of offended by this. </p><p>The moment you open the door you can just sense the sickness. His room is as dark as a cave, closed blinds and a tightly shut window to keep him from getting too cold. A fan for white noise sits at his nightstand and points towards his bed, and the winds rustle literally the only visible part of him: his hair. A large mass atop his bed serves as the outline of him, and you can\u2019t help but smile at the burrow he\u2019s created. It\u2019s almost like a plan, buried, barely visible by the top.\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">You giggle despite his suffering.</p><p>But, then, you remember <i>why</i> he\u2019s created his little hole and it makes you frown all over again in worry. What had started out with what he thought was allergies had turned into something worse, a fever that was rather adamant about sticking around. Exhaustion, heavy limbs (all six of them!) were his downfalls. From the moment he mentioned he wasn\u2019t feeling very well you were worrying like a mother hen, and no amounts of his assurance could help.\u00a0</p><p>This was not how he expected to spend his winter break. </p><p>\u201cUm.. Mezo?\u201d You whisper, using your heel to shut the door quietly behind you. It clicks just softly enough to keep him from stirring. With the curtains suppressing the sunny day outside, if not for the emptiness of his room you would have had to squint your eyes to navigate your way to him. As you draw closer, you feel yourself freezing in your place. You hadn\u2019t seen it from afar, but the mound of white, messy hair isn\u2019t the only part of him that&rsquo;s visible to you. </p><p>Even with the sickness, Shouji sleeps soundly. On his side, back facing you, he tucks his chin with the blanket pulled just above his neck. Even though you know it\u2019s unfair to take advantage of his rest, you can\u2019t stop yourself from looking. Your eyes, geedy and searching, trail all the way from his shut eyes down to the rest of his face, exposed for the first time. Your heart leaps in your chest at the sight of him, the first time.\u00a0</p><p>His nose pushes out, strangely animalistic in it\u2019s own way. Like a muzzle, almost. His lips stretch along the broadness of his face, and you feel a flutter in your heart. <i>This</i> is what he\u2019s warned you of so many times before. All your relationship, even before you\u2019d come close with him, he\u2019d told you time and time again that while he understood you\u2019d love him in any form, he didn\u2019t like the idea of you seeing what lie beneath his mask. </p><p>But god, he was so cute. You wanted to kiss every part of him, fever or not.\u00a0</p><p>A smile creeps onto your face. You reach out, gently press a hand to where you think his shoulder is, and shake him softly.</p><p>\u201cMezo,\u201d You whisper. \u201cWake up.\u201d While he makes a sound in the back of his throat, eyebrows knitting, he doesn\u2019t entirely wake, so you try again. \u201cI have soup.\u201d</p><p>That seems to grab him out of whatever dreams he\u2019d been casted into. His eyes open to face the wall, blinking slowly. As if in a trance, he turns to you in silence. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Mom?\u201d</p><p>You giggle. \u201cNah, just me.\u201d</p><p>For some reason it takes him a long, long moment to process that information. Over his shoulder he just stares at you with perplexion. You get an even better of his features and it makes you want to reach out and smooch him on his lips finally, because his hair is a mess and he just looks so <i>damn cute</i> with doe-full eyes that can\u2019t quite concentrate. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Your voice falls just above a whisper, and you turn to set the soup down on his nightstand beside the fan just so you can reach out and pet over the top of his hair.</p><p>Something about the contact seems to shake him alive. His eyes widen, he yanks away from you and throws the blanket over his head in an almost childlike manner, terrified. Naturally you reach out and try to sooth the outburst, take hold of the covers and gently pry it away, but for the first time, he fights you.</p><p>\u201cYou saw\u2026\u201d He mumbles from beneath the covers, and you sigh.</p><p>\u201cI saw.\u201d As you pull away you sit down at the edge of his bed. \u201cYou made it sound like it was something of a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>You can almost feel the way his eyebrow raises.

You\u2019re suddenly hyper-reminded of the child he\u2019d encountered in his youth who\u2019d bumped into him, looked up at the hulking form of his body and didn\u2019t cry at the shape of him, but his face, and his face alone. It hurts your heart.</p><p>You sigh sadly. \u201cCan you look at me?\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, cautious almost, he pulls the blankets down to his nose. Just barely can you see the slope that extends outwards. When his nervous eyes meet yours, you smile as warmly as you can manage through the sensitivity. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you time and time again,\u201d You begin with a quiet voice. \u201cThat I love you no matter what you look like. You don\u2019t have to hide from me.\u201d Reaching out, you gently tug the blanket. \u201cSo can you please\u2026 Stop hiding?\u201d</p><p>Even though it\u2019s easy to see that he\u2019d rather not, he does anyways. He brings the blanket down and awkwardly grips the fabric he surrounds himself in like it\u2019s some sort of outlet for his anxiety.</p><p>Before he can even dream to cover himself again, you crawl closer, bring your palms to his cheeks and barely touch the edges of his lips. Your thumbs caress him. \u201cI love all of you, no matter what.

You\u2019re not a scary person, Mezo. You\u2019ll never scare me off, especially with something like how you look. Besides,\u201d The corners of your lips rise. \u201cNow, I can do this.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, uncertainty. He stills himself and wonders what\u2019s to come, and you beat him to any sort of punchline. </p><p>The kiss is chaste, barely there, but it\u2019s a milestone paved of gold. Fever be damned, you peck his lips and pull away with a shy smile while your heart does flips in your chest. </p><p>He flushes all the way from his ears to his neck and there\u2019s <i>no</i> way the fever had made him <i>that</i> red. You giggle, he touches his lips with one of his hands and blinks at you.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re sick and all,\u201d You start, \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help myself.

She claps her hands together and grins nice and wide. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure when you\u2019d be arriving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that, I texted Mezo but I don\u2019t think he saw it.\u201d Sheepishly you rub the back of your head, your other hand occupied with the plastic bag you\u2019d carried over from your place to his.</p><p>\u201cNo worries!\u201d She steps aside. \u201cCome on in. He\u2019s just resting up for now, you can go right in.\u201d</p><p>Your brows knit. \u201cWould he be fine if I just\u2026 Walked in?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Shouji shuts the door and follows behind you as you wander to the kitchen, hoist your bag up and set it on the counter. As she helps you unwrap a very well packaged container of soup, she giggles.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s you coming in I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be alright. Just don\u2019t jump on him- he\u2019s a confused waker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d The idea of Shouji awakening with that blurry, momentary confusion is a fun one to play with. Messy hair, glazed over eyes, those pensive brows. Internally you fawn over him. \u201cThanks for letting me over, by the way. Is he doing any better?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Shouji sighs and slumps her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Yesterday he was up to eat dinner but he headed right back to sleep after he was done. Hopefully it just stays at a fever and nothing else developes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be scary\u2026 Hopefully this helps him feel better, even if it\u2019s just by a little bit. I hate to see him unwell\u2026\u201d</p><p>One of her hands reaches out, touches at your shoulder. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m glad he has you.\u201d</p><p>Her statement, albeit harmless, makes you flush. This would surely be a moment that Shouji would internally gush over- his mother openly approving of you, supporting you. Even without him you feel the pride bubbling in your chest. </p><p>\u201cT-Thank you, so much, that seriously means a lot.\u201d You smile.</p><p>\u201cNo need to thank me,\u201d She turns around and retrieves a bowl from the cupboard, pours the soup from the plastic container and hands it back to you after settling a spoon in the broth. \u201cJust tell him mom says \u2018hi\u2019 when you go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d  Nodding eagerly, you hold the bowl. You take your leave from the kitchen and wander down the hallway to his room, stand outside and stop for just a moment. Even with his mother\u2019s blessing, you still feel strange just\u2026 Barging in without his permission. You\u2019d wished he would have send you a confirmation message that he knew you were coming, even if it was nothing more than just a random emoji. As you reach out you hope that he doesn\u2019t get all sorts of offended by this. </p><p>The moment you open the door you can just sense the sickness. His room is as dark as a cave, closed blinds and a tightly shut window to keep him from getting too cold. A fan for white noise sits at his nightstand and points towards his bed, and the winds rustle literally the only visible part of him: his hair. A large mass atop his bed serves as the outline of him, and you can\u2019t help but smile at the burrow he\u2019s created. It\u2019s almost like a plan, buried, barely visible by the top.\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">You giggle despite his suffering.</p><p>But, then, you remember <i>why</i> he\u2019s created his little hole and it makes you frown all over again in worry. What had started out with what he thought was allergies had turned into something worse, a fever that was rather adamant about sticking around. Exhaustion, heavy limbs (all six of them!) were his downfalls. From the moment he mentioned he wasn\u2019t feeling very well you were worrying like a mother hen, and no amounts of his assurance could help.\u00a0</p><p>This was not how he expected to spend his winter break. </p><p>\u201cUm.. Mezo?\u201d You whisper, using your heel to shut the door quietly behind you. It clicks just softly enough to keep him from stirring. With the curtains suppressing the sunny day outside, if not for the emptiness of his room you would have had to squint your eyes to navigate your way to him. As you draw closer, you feel yourself freezing in your place. You hadn\u2019t seen it from afar, but the mound of white, messy hair isn\u2019t the only part of him that\u2019s visible to you. </p><p>Even with the sickness, Shouji sleeps soundly. On his side, back facing you, he tucks his chin with the blanket pulled just above his neck. Even though you know it\u2019s unfair to take advantage of his rest, you can\u2019t stop yourself from looking. Your eyes, geedy and searching, trail all the way from his shut eyes down to the rest of his face, exposed for the first time. Your heart leaps in your chest at the sight of him, the first time.\u00a0</p><p>His nose pushes out, strangely animalistic in it\u2019s own way. Like a muzzle, almost. His lips stretch along the broadness of his face, and you feel a flutter in your heart. <i>This</i> is what he\u2019s warned you of so many times before. All your relationship, even before you\u2019d come close with him, he\u2019d told you time and time again that while he understood you\u2019d love him in any form, he didn\u2019t like the idea of you seeing what lie beneath his mask. </p><p>But god, he was so cute. You wanted to kiss every part of him, fever or not.\u00a0</p><p>A smile creeps onto your face. You reach out, gently press a hand to where you think his shoulder is, and shake him softly.</p><p>\u201cMezo,\u201d You whisper. \u201cWake up.\u201d While he makes a sound in the back of his throat, eyebrows knitting, he doesn\u2019t entirely wake, so you try again. \u201cI have soup.\u201d</p><p>That seems to grab him out of whatever dreams he\u2019d been casted into. His eyes open to face the wall, blinking slowly. As if in a trance, he turns to you in silence. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Mom?\u201d</p><p>You giggle. \u201cNah, just me.\u201d</p><p>For some reason it takes him a long, long moment to process that information. Over his shoulder he just stares at you with perplexion. You get an even better of his features and it makes you want to reach out and smooch him on his lips finally, because his hair is a mess and he just looks so <i>damn cute</i> with doe-full eyes that can\u2019t quite concentrate. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Your voice falls just above a whisper, and you turn to set the soup down on his nightstand beside the fan just so you can reach out and pet over the top of his hair.</p><p>Something about the contact seems to shake him alive.

All your relationship, even before you\u2019d come close with him, he\u2019d told you time and time again that while he understood you\u2019d love him in any form, he didn\u2019t like the idea of you seeing what lie beneath his mask. </p><p>But god, he was so cute. You wanted to kiss every part of him, fever or not.\u00a0</p><p>A smile creeps onto your face. You reach out, gently press a hand to where you think his shoulder is, and shake him softly.</p><p>\u201cMezo,\u201d You whisper. \u201cWake up.\u201d While he makes a sound in the back of his throat, eyebrows knitting, he doesn\u2019t entirely wake, so you try again. \u201cI have soup.\u201d</p><p>That seems to grab him out of whatever dreams he\u2019d been casted into. His eyes open to face the wall, blinking slowly. As if in a trance, he turns to you in silence. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Mom?\u201d</p><p>You giggle. \u201cNah, just me.\u201d</p><p>For some reason it takes him a long, long moment to process that information. Over his shoulder he just stares at you with perplexion. You get an even better of his features and it makes you want to reach out and smooch him on his lips finally, because his hair is a mess and he just looks so <i>damn cute</i> with doe-full eyes that can\u2019t quite concentrate. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Your voice falls just above a whisper, and you turn to set the soup down on his nightstand beside the fan just so you can reach out and pet over the top of his hair.</p><p>Something about the contact seems to shake him alive. His eyes widen, he yanks away from you and throws the blanket over his head in an almost childlike manner, terrified. Naturally you reach out and try to sooth the outburst, take hold of the covers and gently pry it away, but for the first time, he fights you.</p><p>\u201cYou saw\u2026\u201d He mumbles from beneath the covers, and you sigh.</p><p>\u201cI saw.\u201d As you pull away you sit down at the edge of his bed. \u201cYou made it sound like it was something of a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>You can almost feel the way his eyebrow raises. The pregnant pause he takes make you frown. \u201c\u2026You don\u2019t find it ugly?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Do <i>you</i>?\u201d Your brows knit as you look at him, the shape of him under the mound of blankets. </p><p>\u201cNo necessarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem\u2026?\u201d Resting your hands on your lap, your shoulders slump. \u201cDid you think I\u2019d find you ugly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ugly, but\u2026 Scary.\u201d</p><p>It strikes you like an arrow through the heart. You\u2019re suddenly hyper-reminded of the child he\u2019d encountered in his youth who\u2019d bumped into him, looked up at the hulking form of his body and didn\u2019t cry at the shape of him, but his face, and his face alone. It hurts your heart.</p><p>You sigh sadly. \u201cCan you look at me?\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, cautious almost, he pulls the blankets down to his nose. Just barely can you see the slope that extends outwards. When his nervous eyes meet yours, you smile as warmly as you can manage through the sensitivity. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you time and time again,\u201d You begin with a quiet voice. \u201cThat I love you no matter what you look like. You don\u2019t have to hide from me.\u201d Reaching out, you gently tug the blanket. \u201cSo can you please\u2026 Stop hiding?\u201d</p><p>Even though it\u2019s easy to see that he\u2019d rather not, he does anyways. He brings the blanket down and awkwardly grips the fabric he surrounds himself in like it\u2019s some sort of outlet for his anxiety.</p><p>Before he can even dream to cover himself again, you crawl closer, bring your palms to his cheeks and barely touch the edges of his lips. Your thumbs caress him. \u201cI love all of you, no matter what. It doesn\u2019t matter if you look like this, it\u2019s what makes you, you.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cAnd my face\u2026 It\u2026 That doesn\u2019t scare you?\u201d </b></p><p>Your heart hurts again. \u201cOf course not. You\u2019re not a scary person, Mezo. You\u2019ll never scare me off, especially with something like how you look. Besides,\u201d The corners of your lips rise. \u201cNow, I can do this.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, uncertainty. He stills himself and wonders what\u2019s to come, and you beat him to any sort of punchline. </p><p>The kiss is chaste, barely there, but it\u2019s a milestone paved of gold. Fever be damned, you peck his lips and pull away with a shy smile while your heart does flips in your chest. </p><p>He flushes all the way from his ears to his neck and there\u2019s <i>no</i> way the fever had made him <i>that</i> red. You giggle, he touches his lips with one of his hands and blinks at you.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re sick and all,\u201d You start, \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help myself. You\u2019re just so cute.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>YES thank you so much for this prompt i love my baybie boy &lt;3 (also! i love you too!!!!!! to the whole moon and back)</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>04. shouji mezo / reader</h2><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Three knocks is all it takes before the wooden door is swinging open, revealing a very familiar face.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; Mrs. Shouji beams. She claps her hands together and grins nice and wide. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure when you&rsquo;d be arriving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sorry about that, I texted Mezo but I don&rsquo;t think he saw it.&rdquo; Sheepishly you rub the back of your head, your other hand occupied with the plastic bag you&rsquo;d carried over from your place to his.</p><p>&ldquo;No worries!&rdquo; She steps aside. &ldquo;Come on in. He&rsquo;s just resting up for now, you can go right in.&rdquo;</p><p>Your brows knit. &ldquo;Would he be fine if I just&hellip; Walked in?&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Shouji shuts the door and follows behind you as you wander to the kitchen, hoist your bag up and set it on the counter. As she helps you unwrap a very well packaged container of soup, she giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s you coming in I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be alright. Just don&rsquo;t jump on him- he&rsquo;s a confused waker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; The idea of Shouji awakening with that blurry, momentary confusion is a fun one to play with. Messy hair, glazed over eyes, those pensive brows. Internally you fawn over him. &ldquo;Thanks for letting me over, by the way. Is he doing any better?&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Shouji sighs and slumps her shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Yesterday he was up to eat dinner but he headed right back to sleep after he was done. Hopefully it just stays at a fever and nothing else developes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That would be scary&hellip; Hopefully this helps him feel better, even if it&rsquo;s just by a little bit. I hate to see him unwell&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>One of her hands reaches out, touches at your shoulder. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s exactly why I&rsquo;m glad he has you.&rdquo;</p><p>Her statement, albeit harmless, makes you flush. This would surely be a moment that Shouji would internally gush over- his mother openly approving of you, supporting you. Even without him you feel the pride bubbling in your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;T-Thank you, so much, that seriously means a lot.&rdquo; You smile.</p><p>&ldquo;No need to thank me,&rdquo; She turns around and retrieves a bowl from the cupboard, pours the soup from the plastic container and hands it back to you after settling a spoon in the broth. &ldquo;Just tell him mom says &lsquo;hi&rsquo; when you go in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;  Nodding eagerly, you hold the bowl. You take your leave from the kitchen and wander down the hallway to his room, stand outside and stop for just a moment. Even with his mother&rsquo;s blessing, you still feel strange just&hellip; Barging in without his permission. You&rsquo;d wished he would have send you a confirmation message that he knew you were coming, even if it was nothing more than just a random emoji. As you reach out you hope that he doesn&rsquo;t get all sorts of offended by this. </p><p>The moment you open the door you can just sense the sickness. His room is as dark as a cave, closed blinds and a tightly shut window to keep him from getting too cold. A fan for white noise sits at his nightstand and points towards his bed, and the winds rustle literally the only visible part of him: his hair. A large mass atop his bed serves as the outline of him, and you can&rsquo;t help but smile at the burrow he&rsquo;s created. It&rsquo;s almost like a plan, buried, barely visible by the top.&nbsp;</p><p>You giggle despite his suffering.</p><p>But, then, you remember <i>why</i> he&rsquo;s created his little hole and it makes you frown all over again in worry. What had started out with what he thought was allergies had turned into something worse, a fever that was rather adamant about sticking around. Exhaustion, heavy limbs (all six of them!) were his downfalls. From the moment he mentioned he wasn&rsquo;t feeling very well you were worrying like a mother hen, and no amounts of his assurance could help.&nbsp;</p><p>This was not how he expected to spend his winter break. </p><p>&ldquo;Um.. Mezo?&rdquo; You whisper, using your heel to shut the door quietly behind you. It clicks just softly enough to keep him from stirring. With the curtains suppressing the sunny day outside, if not for the emptiness of his room you would have had to squint your eyes to navigate your way to him. As you draw closer, you feel yourself freezing in your place. You hadn&rsquo;t seen it from afar, but the mound of white, messy hair isn&rsquo;t the only part of him that&rsquo;s visible to you. </p><p>Even with the sickness, Shouji sleeps soundly. On his side, back facing you, he tucks his chin with the blanket pulled just above his neck. Even though you know it&rsquo;s unfair to take advantage of his rest, you can&rsquo;t stop yourself from looking. Your eyes, geedy and searching, trail all the way from his shut eyes down to the rest of his face, exposed for the first time. Your heart leaps in your chest at the sight of him, the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>His nose pushes out, strangely animalistic in it&rsquo;s own way. Like a muzzle, almost. His lips stretch along the broadness of his face, and you feel a flutter in your heart. <i>This</i> is what he&rsquo;s warned you of so many times before.
