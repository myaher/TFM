In spite of the brutal executions and vicious bloodshed, it had taken you a while to speak up; at long last violating the taboo while earning the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Your father sufficing as a close-to-successful trader had always told you: &ldquo;<i>All publicity is good publicity!</i>&rdquo;, especially when newsprint would speak of his grimy ways. In this particular scenario, you were not certain that was the case. But alas, you yourself had put you in the eye of the public and when you along with a colleague had attained valuable information and released it to the citizens of Hala, you then secured yourself a well-earned spot in lock-up. Ultimately you had only yourself to blame.</p><p>The way Yon-Rogg discovered this news concerning you violating Kree law, was when a colleague of his mentioned his &ldquo;hooligan friend going crazy in the square&rdquo;. He knew then who was alluded to, only not what it was she had done this time.</p><p>For the longest time, you two had known each other, see all the way back to when you were both in the academy learning how to handle the Nega-Bands, and that was why you knew it would take more for him to give up on you as you were on opposite sites. He was the brave soldier putting his life on the line and you were the pacifist, the wavering cadet who had taken the life of an officer during gun practice. It had been an accident, but nonetheless a purebred had been killed and for that, you were punished.</p><p>In the lock-up, Yon-Rogg had been careful to not be seen by too many, not happy about showing his face in such an unsavory place. Should anyone recognize him and ask what business he had in the lock-up, he did not know how he should explain himself. Admitting he had come to speak sense into the woman that had spread filthy lies of the Kree Empire was not an opportunity, seeing as he at the moment was not content calling her a friend.</p><p>Finally, he had found you and with no further fuss, he got straight to the point, not holding back and you could not help but pull a face and shake your head at his devout mindset.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you even ask if you were ordered to kill someone?&rdquo; quizzed you and Yon-Rogg breathed a sigh, turning his back as he ran and hand over his face. Your words seemed to fall on deaf ears. You had not seen the things he had, why would you understand the ways of the war. Your eyes grew wide with realization when he turned only to give you a hard stare. Leaning over the table slightly, mind barely comprehending what must run through the mind of the man you had called &ldquo;friend&rdquo; for so long, you creased your brow and concluded, &ldquo;you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> ask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are things you don&rsquo;t understand&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This sets the whole war in an entirely new perspective.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even pretend to know something you don&rsquo;t! I do what I do for the good of the people, for the good of you!&rdquo; defended he in a low and restrained tone. You could tell he was having difficulties controlling himself, so keen on having you see the good in him while being utterly oblivious as to what evil he protected. &ldquo;Look at all the good we have done. All to protect Hala&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yon-Rogg, you don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re fighting for any more! None of you do, and you put no question to it because it&rsquo;s all you know! Chaos and blood and war&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you want out of here you pull yourself together, and you do it right this moment! This little game of yours has been wreaking havoc for too <i>goddamn</i> long and finally, you caught the attention of the Intelligence&ndash;is that not what you wanted? To get the word out and be the hero; the hero that&rsquo;s too damn afraid to wield a weapon! Guess what, Y/N, playtime is over and if you don&rsquo;t watch your back and quiet down after this, Ronan will take matters into own hands.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>His words had been loud, voice booming with anger, with intolerance, with fright. In earlier times it would have ignited a spark and likely sent a train of thoughts down your valley, but know&ndash;sitting on the cool chair, hands restrained and face drained of its usual amuse, reconsideration never sought your features.</p><p>The moment of silence allowed him to calm himself and you knew it was needed should you want to speak some sense into his credulous mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Ignorance is not bliss, Yon-Rogg,&rdquo; began you and your tiresome, gleaming eyes gave away the gloom lurking and it seemed he had had enough, for he then turned on his heel. &ldquo;If you refuse to accept this now, you will only realize when it is too late. Don&rsquo;t do that to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Your calling was like a cry for help and your guttural tone unsettled his gained equilibrium so he stopped in his march.</p><p>His grip around the handle tightened, turning his knuckles white and the door locked with a clicking sounds. You could see from his clenched jaw he felt no surplus for this today, and although you hated to get on his nerve, you could not help it. This military dictatorship was doing the Empire wrong and all the people in it, you could no longer tolerate merely standing on the sidelines.</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stop acting like the Cotati, there will be nothing I can do. It simply is not our way&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We can change the way, Yon&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; yelled he, punching a dent in the heavy door. His chest was heaving and the prominent vein in his neck showed more than minutes ago. With determined steps he strode to your side, eyes boring into yours and you felt your breath punched out of your lungs without him even laying a hand on you.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you detest our way so, then you leave. You leave and you leave the Supreme Intelligence be, that way you might get to live.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I cannot leave, you know that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then my suggestion is that when the law comes for you, you ask for Ronan and beg for forgiveness,&rdquo; said he and you drooped your head back, repeating his name finding his thinking beyond ridiculous. He repeated himself, this time his voice louder and rougher,&nbsp;&ldquo;you apologize for this <i>propaganda</i>&nbsp;and pray that he will spare you great suffering.&rdquo;</p><p>Letting go of the inside of your cheeks, you wet your chapped lips.&nbsp;&ldquo;Have you seen the data? I assume they have gotten rid of any trace proving their wrongdoing by now, but if you were to take a look&ndash;I promise you, Yon-Rogg, you will not be happy to go to work tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>It took him some time, but he responded and had the decency to spare you the last look before he would make his exit.
