Let's hope Andi Mack doesn't screw up Tyrus in its brief official scene in 3x21 as much as Disgrassi did with Triles. They had so much potential in 'Thunderstruck' (love the music in the rain) then turned it into something so toxic and damaging to bi guys in season 14. Also lol everyone mad that we got to wait 21 episode between the look back and Tyrus cannoning, Degrassi had 40x eps between setting up up Triles and 'Thundersrtruck'",
        "answer": "<p>That\u2019s one of the good things about Andi Mack potentially ending with season 3. They aren\u2019t going to have time to fuck up Tyrus after it endgames. We aren\u2019t going to have to see them fighting or breaking up or any of the other drama we see with the het ships. We may very well just get a happy ending which is really important as that doesn\u2019t happen often with LGBTQ+ couples on TV.</p><p>As for Degrassi, I really think they meant well. I think they did a very good job at Triles in the beginning, and I think they actually ended Triles very well. I\u2019ve talked about before how dramatic and intense the beginning of that relationship felt, and it was actually a good thing. The way they ended, with Tristan finally learning to put his own well-being before his love life, and Miles being forced to take care of himself instead of someone else, was very special. And the fact that they left it kind of open ended, so that viewers could decide for themselves whether or not they think the couple would get back together was very nice. They only really messed it up in the middle there, especially during seasons 1-2 of Next Class. But I think they kind of messed up everything during those two seasons tbh. Maya was unbearable. A lot of the other characters just felt out of place. And a big part of that is that they had to unexpectedly switch networks and change from the 40-episode format to 10-episode format. They really should have addressed the reasons for Tristan\u2019s biphobia instead of leaving that in subtext though, as that was one of the major issues with their relationship (aside from the general toxicity of both characters). But hey nothing like a good old fashion nearly-fatal bus crash followed by a season without being able to speak to make one of the most obnoxious, problematic characters on a series slightly less obnoxious and problematic.\u00a0</p>",
