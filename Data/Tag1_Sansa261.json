Do you think any character on the show now is actually fulfilling the arc of a book character, or having their storyline merged with a book character?",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>that is a difficult question\u2026.</p><p>Obviously it depends quite a lot on what I think will happen in the books, so you have to take this with a huge grain of salt!</p><p>I think that the show actually is not that different from what the books will be. And certainly far less different than book purists claim. For example, I\u2019m convinced that Sansa will end up North (as the girl in grey), and that she and Jon will reclaim Winterfell. I also believe that Stannis will indeed sacrifice his daughter for better weather in the books - it is his tragedy that he who believes that he is the chosen one will fail spectacularly. <br/></p><p>I also believe that the Dorne storyline will be cut short, not as brutal as in the show, but Doran Martell has been set up as a schemer who will scheme himself to death. In the show they did botch the Dorne storyline but I guess in the end the result will be almost the same: Dornish without any Martell to rule them. Arianne and fAegon will go down in the books, so that by the time Da\u20acnerys meets Jon she will think that the treasons are beyond her.</p><div>I also believe the Tyrion will end up as a councillor to Da\u20acnerys maybe even her Hand, and I believe that Da\u20acnerys will bend the Khals into submission as well. <br/></div><div><p><br/></p><p>Arya\u2019s arc has been changed as well. She didn\u2019t meet Lady Stoneheart in the show, but I guess we will see her and possibly Jaime when the Freys meet their fate. I also think that there will be some tension between Sansa and Arya when they meet again, because they have to work out their issues. I just hope it won\u2019t be as bad as the Winterhell plot in season 7.</p><p>Also Cersei blowing up the sept will happen. I doubt that she\u2019ll rule in her own right though, because the rules of succession GRRM has put up don\u2019t allow for that in the books. I guess bookwise Tommen will be around longer.<br/></p><p>So the main characters are set on the same path I think. It is minor characters who have been propped up (like Lyanna Mormont) or reduced (like Alys Karstark) or cut out entirely. So, there is plenty of merging there. The betrayal of the Umbers and Karstarks is a merging of Karstark and Dustins in the books I would say, while Lyanna Mormont possibly is just the representative of loyal Northern Lords (of which we have way more in the books). But I\u2019m not sure this would count as merging, I would rather name it reducing to the bullet points, I guess.</p><p>Some people have said, that Jon\u2019s arc is merged with fAegon\u2019s from the book, but I am not sure about that. This interpretation is mainly born from Jon\u2019s name being Aegon on the show and the fact that Jon and Da\u20acnerys meet under circumstances that might set them up as enemies (and you know, they are ice and fire and can\u2019t be enemies, while it is pretty clear, that Da\u20acnerys will roast fAegon in the books).</p><p>I am not so sure about that, tbh. As I said above: They have brutally cut the Dorne storyline and I think fAegon is very much part of this and will go down with Dorne, maybe even before Da\u20acnerys arrives or shortly afterwards. And as much as I dislike Aegon as a name for Jon, it is not unconceivable that this is his name. When he was born, the male heirs of Rhaegar were dead and how better claim his legitimacy than giving him the very name of the dynasty\u2019s founder? I do think that people who claim Jon has taken over fAegon\u2019s arc want to explain why Jon and Da\u20acnerys have been set up for a Targbowl at least in part, and they explain the political differences with the lingering residues of fAegon\u2019s storyline. I doubt that. <br/></p><p>I think it is even likely that Jon will set out to get dragons, he wished for them in ASOS after all, and the circumstance of his first meeting with Da\u20acnerys will also not be perfect. Turn it as you want, their political goals are different. Not unsurmountable different, but difficult, and by the end of season 7 they haven\u2019t worked out a compromise, but a takeover so to say. Nothing in season 7 points towards Jon\u2019s arc as fAegon influenced. The only thing that might be interpreted this way is that GRRM claimed that Jon and Da\u20acnerys will \u201cmeet later\u201d in the books - whatever that means.</p><p>So, imho, the meeting of Jon and Da\u20acnerys in the books will be in quite similar circumstances, Jon desperately seeking an alliance, Da\u20acnerys refusing it and Jon being \u2018political Jon\u2019.</p><p>To sum up: I think that the Sansa/fArya=Jeyne swap was a single occasion. I don\u2019t think any of the other changes are that drastic. But this is only my take on what will happen in the books. Lots of what we have seen on screen is far less intricate than the books, but the major plot points are reached, even if some of the characters suffer from the reduction - Arya for example.<br/></p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br/></p></div>",

In the show they did botch the Dorne storyline but I guess in the end the result will be almost the same: Dornish without any Martell to rule them.

I just hope it won\u2019t be as bad as the Winterhell plot in season 7.</p><p>Also Cersei blowing up the sept will happen. I doubt that she\u2019ll rule in her own right though, because the rules of succession GRRM has put up don\u2019t allow for that in the books. I guess bookwise Tommen will be around longer.<br></p><p>So the main characters are set on the same path I think. It is minor characters who have been propped up (like Lyanna Mormont) or reduced (like Alys Karstark) or cut out entirely. So, there is plenty of merging there. The betrayal of the Umbers and Karstarks is a merging of Karstark and Dustins in the books I would say, while Lyanna Mormont possibly is just the representative of loyal Northern Lords (of which we have way more in the books). But I\u2019m not sure this would count as merging, I would rather name it reducing to the bullet points, I guess.</p><p>Some people have said, that Jon\u2019s arc is merged with fAegon\u2019s from the book, but I am not sure about that. This interpretation is mainly born from Jon\u2019s name being Aegon on the show and the fact that Jon and Da\u20acnerys meet under circumstances that might set them up as enemies (and you know, they are ice and fire and can\u2019t be enemies, while it is pretty clear, that Da\u20acnerys will roast fAegon in the books).</p><p>I am not so sure about that, tbh. As I said above: They have brutally cut the Dorne storyline and I think fAegon is very much part of this and will go down with Dorne, maybe even before Da\u20acnerys arrives or shortly afterwards. And as much as I dislike Aegon as a name for Jon, it is not unconceivable that this is his name. When he was born, the male heirs of Rhaegar were dead and how better claim his legitimacy than giving him the very name of the dynasty\u2019s founder? I do think that people who claim Jon has taken over fAegon\u2019s arc want to explain why Jon and Da\u20acnerys have been set up for a Targbowl at least in part, and they explain the political differences with the lingering residues of fAegon\u2019s storyline. I doubt that. <br></p><p>I think it is even likely that Jon will set out to get dragons, he wished for them in ASOS after all, and the circumstance of his first meeting with Da\u20acnerys will also not be perfect. Turn it as you want, their political goals are different. Not unsurmountable different, but difficult, and by the end of season 7 they haven\u2019t worked out a compromise, but a takeover so to say. Nothing in season 7 points towards Jon\u2019s arc as fAegon influenced. The only thing that might be interpreted this way is that GRRM claimed that Jon and Da\u20acnerys will \u201cmeet later\u201d in the books - whatever that means.</p><p>So, imho, the meeting of Jon and Da\u20acnerys in the books will be in quite similar circumstances, Jon desperately seeking an alliance, Da\u20acnerys refusing it and Jon being \u2018political Jon\u2019.</p><p>To sum up: I think that the Sansa/fArya=Jeyne swap was a single occasion. I don\u2019t think any of the other changes are that drastic. But this is only my take on what will happen in the books. Lots of what we have seen on screen is far less intricate than the books, but the major plot points are reached, even if some of the characters suffer from the reduction - Arya for example.<br></p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br></p></div></p>",

This system is inherently rigged against Tyrion because not only does Tyrion have specific trauma related to his disability that would make any arranged marriage humiliating and awful, not only does the system position Tyrion as too disabled for a high match and too high born for anyone else, but Tyrion&rsquo;s father doesn&rsquo;t care at all for his son&rsquo;s personal safety, wants and needs. The specific situation Tywin puts Tyrion in is abusive because ordering someone to abuse someone else is itself a form of abuse of that person, but the system is specifically rigged to allow that kind of situation to happen.
