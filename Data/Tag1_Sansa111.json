Probably, but she had been taught to look up to authority and she had no way to get at the truth. She was not allowed to see her father. She was frightened and alone and manipulated.

                "content": "<p>to strip ned off winterfell. Rest of his children, wife &amp; \rNortherners believe ned but she doesn&rsquo;t. She thinks that ned &amp; Robb \rare traitors. Another thing I disagree with that she did the right thing\r by siding with neither joff nor Arya coz she neither want to go against\r her family &amp; nor her future husband/in laws. I think she did to \rimpress joff. That &amp; the letter she wrote has more to do with \rwanting to elevate herself in joff&rsquo;s eyes. Lastly her telling the truth \rcould'v save mycah &amp; lady life.\r &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dear nonny,</p><p>How can justify Sansa in the first book? You said it yourself : She was a teenager.</p><p>When I was 17 (5 years older than canon Sansa) I was head over heels for a boy who had zero interest in me and it took me the better part of a year to claw my way out of my romantic imaginations. I had no connection to reality and I interpreted everything he did as pointing towards him being as much in love as me. And I&rsquo;m a fairly rational person. </p><p>Anyway I beg to differ in several points.</p><p>First of all, the incident at the Trident : Sansa is not the only one to blame, if you go around and throw around blame. </p><p>There is Ned: He goes south to investigate Jon Arryn&rsquo;s murder and does not warn his daughters, not a hint. Remember that Arya does not know either, she is just more suspicious than Sansa, but she hasn&rsquo;t been told that she&rsquo;ll marry into the Baratheon family. Ned might have felt that he could not share his secrets, and he didn&rsquo;t want to raise suspicions by not taking his daughters, but at least he could have warned his daughter Arya that the easy way of Winterfell was over. They were not in the North any more where his will was law, but in the South with the King. And he did not warn Arya that she should be more careful with her friends. In fact he left all the education to Septa Mordane who was also not in the know. And he trusted Robert. That was sub-par parenting on Ned&rsquo;s side, although I love him and he is still far above any father in Westeros (with the exception of Sam). At the hearing about the incident he expects his daughter Sansa who told him everything in the safety of his arms probably, that she should repeat her testimony in full court. He does not entertain the idea that Robert might judge different than he himself.</p><p>Then there is Catelyn. I love Catelyn and my headcanon is that she would have given the girls several lectures before her departure. But she was devastated by Bran&rsquo;s fall and did not do this. Arya sort of ran into an open knife because of it.</p><p>Then there is Joffrey who made Sansa drunk and really showed his classicism towards Arya&rsquo;s friend.</p><p>Then there is Cersei with her misconception of what a loving mother should do who pushes for a punishment of Arya instead of correcting her own kid. Arya was lucky that she was found by Jory. We later learn through Jaime&rsquo;s POV that Cersei sent him out to kill Arya.</p><p>Then there is Robert who fears a fight with his bitch wife and does not want to go to the bottom of the fight. He later tells Ned that he knew that his son was to blame. How many times did he not punish his son for doing shit because he feared his wife? - I am not condoning hitting him, but Joffrey became what he was because he was always told that he was the Prince.</p><p>Arya should not have asked Mycah to play with her.

In a recent rewatch, I really found Dany to be boring but my interest in Sansa&rsquo;s story really increased.  I like Jon well enough, but it is basically so that he can serve the story or work as a warrior to keep others safe.  I don&rsquo;t care fundamentally about his character&hellip;or Dany&rsquo;s really anymore.  I guess I could care less about those two getting together.  I just want a good storyline for Sansa and, like you, becoming her mom is not it.                    </blockquote><p>I get this. Even though I loved Dany in the earlier seasons, my interest in her story has waned quite a bit since season 5 or so. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the writing or that I feel her character stopped developing a while ago. Still. I find her more interesting as a character than Jon. And I\u2019m not completely annoyed by Jon, because like you, I can see his purpose in the story - even if I\u2019m not particularly interested in him as a character. My interest in Sansa has just kept going up during each season and I think there\u2019s many twists and turns her character can still take, which is what makes her so interesting. Dany\u2019s motives are pretty much set in stone since season 2. I\u2019m not 100% sure what Sansa wants yet, or what she\u2019ll do. And watching her figure stuff out in increasingly tough situations has been very interesting. I wasn\u2019t incredibly fond of Catelyn as a character, and I would be disappointed\u00a0to see Sansa simply become her mother at the end. I don\u2019t know why some Jonsa\u00a0fans hate this idea, but I personally would love to see Sansa become more manipulative and savvy and reach her full potential as a player. I like the idea that she isn\u2019t 100% loyal to Jon, because, why would she be? Why should Jon get to be Lord of Winterfell or w/ever when she\u2019s the eldest trueborn Stark and also the one with political smarts.\u00a0</p>",
