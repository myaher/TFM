But when Peter comes in contact with a strange chemical it all goes downhill from there.</i></p><p><i>A few weeks later he&rsquo;s recovering within Avengers Tower. Everything&rsquo;s been going good, so what happens when his decathlon team shows up?</i></p><hr><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter wasn\u2019t really having a great day. Or week. Come to think of it, its been a pretty shi-crappy, sorry Cap, past few weeks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It all started when Peter and the team, Bucky and Loki included as they were now part of the team, were lounging about in the Avengers living room. He was sprawled across one of the many worn-in leather couches with his head in Loki\u2019s lap and legs in Bucky\u2019s. Tony, his adoptive father, was sat in a loveseat conversing with Bruce who was on the armchair. Natasha was sat criss cross on the floor below Peter. Clint was on the footrest. Thor was on the couch to their left next to Steve, both of whom were comparing Earth\u2019s politics to Asgard\u2019s. Sam was in the connecting kitchen talking to Scott while making hot chocolate. Rhodey was on another couch with Vision, who was cuddling Wanda, all of whom were watching whatever TV program was on. (It was Dance Moms.)</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was a lazy day in SI - Tony ended up not selling the tower after the whole Homecoming fiasco and the team now lived there, but still regularly went to the compound (but don\u2019t tell anyone it was mainly for Peter) - There were no missions, no school, and most importantly, no alien invaders.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter had his eyes closed, nodding off as Loki threaded his hand through his hair and Bucky had his cool metal arm across his legs. Just as he were about to fall asleep, a loud alarm rang throughout the room interrupting the soft chatter, and thoroughly startling the spiderling into a sitting position, at which Loki gave a noise of protest.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Annoyed at the interruption, all present company looked towards the dining table to see a hologram that had popped up saying \u2018INCOMING CALL: EYE PATCH\u201d. Grumbling, Tony gave an exasperated sigh and said, \u201cJARV? Accept please. May as well get it over with.\u201d The hologram then gave-way to a rather, ahem, <i>upset </i>looking Nick Fury.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Glaring, the bald one eyed directer started to talk. \u201cAvengers. We have a HYDRA threat that needs to be neutralized. All the information needed is being sent as we speak. Fury, out.\u201d And with that, Nick Fury ended the call.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving an over-dramatized sigh, Clint threw his head back and stood from the footrest. \u201cAnd here I was, hoping to get absolutely nothing done today.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 So here they were now, at one of the last remaining HYDRA bases. This one was on an offshore island. It was relatively small, and not well guarded. Since it was so small, only a handful of Avengers had to come. Spiderman was to get in, disable the security system, and recover all files. Ironman was more or less back up, but he provided air support. Black Widow was to enter along with Hawkeye after the security system was disabled and takedown any agents. Captain America stood guarding the main exit, also taking down any agents that somehow got outside. (There were none.) Bruce was in the Quinjet on standby for medical purposes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was supposed to be simple, Quick. In and out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 But then everything went to shit.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWebs! Head in through the top window and disable the security.\u201d Tony said through the coms. \u201cCareful, theres electricity two feet below the ceiling. Don\u2019t want a fried bug.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving a fake offended gasp, Peter started to crawl up the side of the brick building. \u201cI am offended! Spiders are arachnids, not bugs!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cJust get in and do the job!\u201d Steve stated, not unkindly, as he just wanted to get the job done. Grumbling, Peter followed the commands and went inside. He immediately felt the buzzing electricity underneath him that was making his senses go crazy.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Alarmed, Peter whispered into the coms, \u201cHey guys, this electricity is making my senses go crazy. Im not gonna be able to detect any incoming danger\u201d. At this, Clint gave a small curse and replied,\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry bug. Tasha and I will be watching you.\u201d Too on edge to correct the archer, Peter started to crawl across the ceiling as flat as he could go. All was silent over the coms as he made his way throughout the base and to the security room. Looking down, or was it up, Peter saw three HYDRA agents below him, manning the computers. Luckily for him, there was no electricity in this room but his senses were still going crazy over it, so he was able to silently drop down behind the agents. Acting fast, he shot his arms to the sides and webbed the two agents on the sided and slammed their heads into the one in the middle. They all went down.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Shaking his arms out and jumping Peter gave a relieved sigh. \u201cPhew! I thought I would never get out of there!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. Now get those security systems down.\u201d Tony commanded, as they had to hurry to attract minimum attention.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cRight! Right.\u201d He darted forward and his finger started flying across the keypads. Only a couple minutes later did he get them down. Throwing his arms up he exclaimed, \u201cThey\u2019re down!\u201d He then started to hack in and retrieve the files.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That was when the chaos started.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A few minutes later as he was distracted, he did not notice the HYDRA agent sneaking up on him from behind until his senses went off at the last moment. He whirled around and was met with a face full of chemicals. Spluttering, he waved his hands around to try and disperse it, but he inevitably breathed it in. When his sight cleared, he saw the agent still in front of him, and quickly incapacitated the man.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSpider-Man! Are you alright?\u201d Natasha\u2019s concerned voice came through his coms. He could hear fighting in the background and assumed that she and Clint were now inside the base.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYe-yeah! Yep, all good. Im on my way right now!\u201d He quickly assured her as he darted out the doorway. Running down the hall, he heard Clint grunt in pain, and right as he turned the corner, saw him stumble a bit, holding a hand to his side as a woman stood in front of him. Jolting forward, Peter ran and threw a fist at the woman, which she quickly parried. They exchanged a few blows before Peter managed to get her feet out from under her and knock her unconscious. Spinning back towards his teammate, he saw Clint with one hand on the stone wall with the other on a quickly reddening spot on his side. Alarmed, Peter ran forward to support him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIm fine!\u201d Clint attempted to protest. \u201cJust a little scratch.\u201d Raising an eyebrow, even though Clint couldn\u2019t see it, and ignored his teammate\u2019s poor protesting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo, Barton, you\u2019re not. Spidey, get him to Bruce.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came over the coms just as he blasted a group of agents. Bobbing his head, Peter slung Clint\u2019s left arm over his shoulders as they made their way out of the base. On their way out, they encountered Natasha battling three agents. Noticing Peter hesitate, torn between getting Clint out or helping Natasha, she quickly shocked him out of his stupor by yelling at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGo! Get him to safety, I\u2019ve got this!\u201d Knowing that she was right and not to protest, he quickly continued making his way out of the base. Approaching the exit, he pushed open the door an was blinded by sunlight. As he blinked to clear his vision, he saw Iron Man flying high in the sky, looking over the base. He hobbled pass Steve and Scott, the former who was waving him towards the jet and the latter shrinking and enlarging, throwing enemy agents all over the place. Giving the captain a nod, he quickly made his way into the woods where the jet was sitting in a clearing. He made it to his destination, seeing the back opened and Bruce running out, slinging Clint\u2019s right arm over his shoulders and putting pressure on the wound with his left hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As they made their way into the jet, Bruce began gathering materials and interrogating both heroes. \u201cHow\u2019d he get injured?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Breathing out, Peter answered as honestly as he could. \u201cNot sure. Wasn\u2019t with him. I only heard him after he was hurt and when I rounded the corner he was holding his side.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAh, I\u2019d say, thirty minutes give or take.\u201d Just as he finished the sentence, Bruce had peeled Clint\u2019s vest off of him, and gave a low whistle.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cStab wound. You\u2019re quite lucky,\u201d the doctor remarked as he quickly cleaned the wound and disinfected it, \u201cany higher, and it could have pierced your lung.\u201d Clint only gave a grunt in return and hissed as he started to stitch it up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re coming in. Base has been cleared out. Spidey, you got those files?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice came over the intercoms.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOh! Yeah! Ye-yep, they\u2019re right uhh, right here!\u201d He quickly raised his hand after patting down his form, having forgotten he\u2019d webbed the flash drive to his hip.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. How bout we blow this popsicle stand, huh?\u201d Tony questioned as he landed in the jet, suit retracting, Natasha and Steve not far behind.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Just as Peter opened his mouth to reply, he was hit with a wave of nausea. Stumbling to the left, Steve quickly caught his arm, brows furrowed. \u201cYou okay son?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYeah I just-\u201c he stopped himself by keeling over and breaking into a fit of coughing. Alarmed, Tony and Natasha rushed over, followed by Bruce who had just finished cleaning Clint\u2019s stab wound up. Ripping off his mask so he could breath better, Peter put his hands on the ground and struggled to take a breath.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cKid! Peter! Whats going on?\u201d Tony asked, quite concerned and worried for his kid. Natasha reached forward, putting her hand on his forehead when the coughing stopped before retracting with a hiss.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s burning up. We need to cool him down, <i>now.\u201d </i>Scott immediately ran to the back of the jet and returned with a cool washcloth, putting it on Peter\u2019s head. Just as he was about to protest that he was fine, when his muscles suddenly locked up and started to spasm.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Tony cried out in alarm as Peter fell to the floor, fall broken by Bruce shoving his hands under his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s having a seizure. Scott! Start timing it. Tony, get us to the tower. Nat, call Cho. Steve, help me move him,\u201d Each hero scrambled to follow his instructions, worried for their youngest member. When Steve got Peter into a better spot, without harming him, Bruce set him on his side so he could breath better, and pulled off his jacket, putting it under Peter\u2019s head so he didn\u2019t cause any head injuries.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As the Quinjet was speeding toward New York, Bruce worriedly looked down at Peter who was still seizing.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cScott. Time.\u201d Scott looked down at his watch and with an alarmed look replied,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFour minutes thirty seven seconds.\u201d This was bad. The seizure didn\u2019t look like it was stopping soon, and if it surpassed five minutes, they were in serious trouble. As soon as Scott\u2019s timer hit five minutes, he alarmed the scientist who then turned towards Tony, who was piloting the jet, and yelled in the most terrified voice any of them had ever heard.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFly faster!\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can post part two if anyone wants more. Idk if anyone\u2019ll see this tho. It\u2019s a little scratchy because I found it in the depths of my computer, having total forgotten about it. I hope it\u2019s okay! Please send me constructive criticism, I love evolving and improving my writing style.</p><p>Thank you!!</p>",

We have a HYDRA threat that needs to be neutralized. All the information needed is being sent as we speak. Fury, out.\u201d And with that, Nick Fury ended the call.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving an over-dramatized sigh, Clint threw his head back and stood from the footrest. \u201cAnd here I was, hoping to get absolutely nothing done today.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 So here they were now, at one of the last remaining HYDRA bases. This one was on an offshore island. It was relatively small, and not well guarded. Since it was so small, only a handful of Avengers had to come. Spiderman was to get in, disable the security system, and recover all files. Ironman was more or less back up, but he provided air support. Black Widow was to enter along with Hawkeye after the security system was disabled and takedown any agents. Captain America stood guarding the main exit, also taking down any agents that somehow got outside. (There were none.) Bruce was in the Quinjet on standby for medical purposes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was supposed to be simple, Quick. In and out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 But then everything went to shit.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWebs! Head in through the top window and disable the security.\u201d Tony said through the coms. \u201cCareful, theres electricity two feet below the ceiling. Don\u2019t want a fried bug.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving a fake offended gasp, Peter started to crawl up the side of the brick building. \u201cI am offended! Spiders are arachnids, not bugs!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cJust get in and do the job!\u201d Steve stated, not unkindly, as he just wanted to get the job done. Grumbling, Peter followed the commands and went inside. He immediately felt the buzzing electricity underneath him that was making his senses go crazy.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Alarmed, Peter whispered into the coms, \u201cHey guys, this electricity is making my senses go crazy. Im not gonna be able to detect any incoming danger\u201d. At this, Clint gave a small curse and replied,\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry bug. Tasha and I will be watching you.\u201d Too on edge to correct the archer, Peter started to crawl across the ceiling as flat as he could go. All was silent over the coms as he made his way throughout the base and to the security room. Looking down, or was it up, Peter saw three HYDRA agents below him, manning the computers. Luckily for him, there was no electricity in this room but his senses were still going crazy over it, so he was able to silently drop down behind the agents. Acting fast, he shot his arms to the sides and webbed the two agents on the sided and slammed their heads into the one in the middle. They all went down.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Shaking his arms out and jumping Peter gave a relieved sigh. \u201cPhew! I thought I would never get out of there!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. Now get those security systems down.\u201d Tony commanded, as they had to hurry to attract minimum attention.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cRight! Right.\u201d He darted forward and his finger started flying across the keypads. Only a couple minutes later did he get them down. Throwing his arms up he exclaimed, \u201cThey\u2019re down!\u201d He then started to hack in and retrieve the files.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That was when the chaos started.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A few minutes later as he was distracted, he did not notice the HYDRA agent sneaking up on him from behind until his senses went off at the last moment. He whirled around and was met with a face full of chemicals. Spluttering, he waved his hands around to try and disperse it, but he inevitably breathed it in. When his sight cleared, he saw the agent still in front of him, and quickly incapacitated the man.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSpider-Man! Are you alright?\u201d Natasha\u2019s concerned voice came through his coms. He could hear fighting in the background and assumed that she and Clint were now inside the base.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYe-yeah! Yep, all good. Im on my way right now!\u201d He quickly assured her as he darted out the doorway. Running down the hall, he heard Clint grunt in pain, and right as he turned the corner, saw him stumble a bit, holding a hand to his side as a woman stood in front of him. Jolting forward, Peter ran and threw a fist at the woman, which she quickly parried. They exchanged a few blows before Peter managed to get her feet out from under her and knock her unconscious. Spinning back towards his teammate, he saw Clint with one hand on the stone wall with the other on a quickly reddening spot on his side. Alarmed, Peter ran forward to support him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIm fine!\u201d Clint attempted to protest. \u201cJust a little scratch.\u201d Raising an eyebrow, even though Clint couldn\u2019t see it, and ignored his teammate\u2019s poor protesting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo, Barton, you\u2019re not. Spidey, get him to Bruce.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came over the coms just as he blasted a group of agents. Bobbing his head, Peter slung Clint\u2019s left arm over his shoulders as they made their way out of the base. On their way out, they encountered Natasha battling three agents. Noticing Peter hesitate, torn between getting Clint out or helping Natasha, she quickly shocked him out of his stupor by yelling at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGo! Get him to safety, I\u2019ve got this!\u201d Knowing that she was right and not to protest, he quickly continued making his way out of the base. Approaching the exit, he pushed open the door an was blinded by sunlight. As he blinked to clear his vision, he saw Iron Man flying high in the sky, looking over the base. He hobbled pass Steve and Scott, the former who was waving him towards the jet and the latter shrinking and enlarging, throwing enemy agents all over the place. Giving the captain a nod, he quickly made his way into the woods where the jet was sitting in a clearing. He made it to his destination, seeing the back opened and Bruce running out, slinging Clint\u2019s right arm over his shoulders and putting pressure on the wound with his left hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As they made their way into the jet, Bruce began gathering materials and interrogating both heroes. \u201cHow\u2019d he get injured?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Breathing out, Peter answered as honestly as he could. \u201cNot sure. Wasn\u2019t with him. I only heard him after he was hurt and when I rounded the corner he was holding his side.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAh, I\u2019d say, thirty minutes give or take.\u201d Just as he finished the sentence, Bruce had peeled Clint\u2019s vest off of him, and gave a low whistle.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cStab wound. You\u2019re quite lucky,\u201d the doctor remarked as he quickly cleaned the wound and disinfected it, \u201cany higher, and it could have pierced your lung.\u201d Clint only gave a grunt in return and hissed as he started to stitch it up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re coming in. Base has been cleared out. Spidey, you got those files?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice came over the intercoms.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOh! Yeah! Ye-yep, they\u2019re right uhh, right here!\u201d He quickly raised his hand after patting down his form, having forgotten he\u2019d webbed the flash drive to his hip.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. How bout we blow this popsicle stand, huh?\u201d Tony questioned as he landed in the jet, suit retracting, Natasha and Steve not far behind.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Just as Peter opened his mouth to reply, he was hit with a wave of nausea. Stumbling to the left, Steve quickly caught his arm, brows furrowed. \u201cYou okay son?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYeah I just-\u201c he stopped himself by keeling over and breaking into a fit of coughing. Alarmed, Tony and Natasha rushed over, followed by Bruce who had just finished cleaning Clint\u2019s stab wound up. Ripping off his mask so he could breath better, Peter put his hands on the ground and struggled to take a breath.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cKid! Peter! Whats going on?\u201d Tony asked, quite concerned and worried for his kid. Natasha reached forward, putting her hand on his forehead when the coughing stopped before retracting with a hiss.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s burning up. We need to cool him down, <i>now.\u201d </i>Scott immediately ran to the back of the jet and returned with a cool washcloth, putting it on Peter\u2019s head. Just as he was about to protest that he was fine, when his muscles suddenly locked up and started to spasm.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Tony cried out in alarm as Peter fell to the floor, fall broken by Bruce shoving his hands under his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s having a seizure. Scott! Start timing it. Tony, get us to the tower. Nat, call Cho. Steve, help me move him,\u201d Each hero scrambled to follow his instructions, worried for their youngest member. When Steve got Peter into a better spot, without harming him, Bruce set him on his side so he could breath better, and pulled off his jacket, putting it under Peter\u2019s head so he didn\u2019t cause any head injuries.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As the Quinjet was speeding toward New York, Bruce worriedly looked down at Peter who was still seizing.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cScott. Time.\u201d Scott looked down at his watch and with an alarmed look replied,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFour minutes thirty seven seconds.\u201d This was bad. The seizure didn\u2019t look like it was stopping soon, and if it surpassed five minutes, they were in serious trouble. As soon as Scott\u2019s timer hit five minutes, he alarmed the scientist who then turned towards Tony, who was piloting the jet, and yelled in the most terrified voice any of them had ever heard.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFly faster!\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can post part two if anyone wants more. Idk if anyone\u2019ll see this tho. It\u2019s a little scratchy because I found it in the depths of my computer, having total forgotten about it. I hope it\u2019s okay! Please send me constructive criticism, I love evolving and improving my writing style.</p><p>Thank you!!</p>",

Right.\u201d He darted forward and his finger started flying across the keypads. Only a couple minutes later did he get them down. Throwing his arms up he exclaimed, \u201cThey\u2019re down!\u201d He then started to hack in and retrieve the files.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That was when the chaos started.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A few minutes later as he was distracted, he did not notice the HYDRA agent sneaking up on him from behind until his senses went off at the last moment. He whirled around and was met with a face full of chemicals. Spluttering, he waved his hands around to try and disperse it, but he inevitably breathed it in. When his sight cleared, he saw the agent still in front of him, and quickly incapacitated the man.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSpider-Man! Are you alright?\u201d Natasha\u2019s concerned voice came through his coms. He could hear fighting in the background and assumed that she and Clint were now inside the base.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYe-yeah! Yep, all good. Im on my way right now!\u201d He quickly assured her as he darted out the doorway. Running down the hall, he heard Clint grunt in pain, and right as he turned the corner, saw him stumble a bit, holding a hand to his side as a woman stood in front of him. Jolting forward, Peter ran and threw a fist at the woman, which she quickly parried. They exchanged a few blows before Peter managed to get her feet out from under her and knock her unconscious. Spinning back towards his teammate, he saw Clint with one hand on the stone wall with the other on a quickly reddening spot on his side. Alarmed, Peter ran forward to support him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIm fine!\u201d Clint attempted to protest. \u201cJust a little scratch.\u201d Raising an eyebrow, even though Clint couldn\u2019t see it, and ignored his teammate\u2019s poor protesting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo, Barton, you\u2019re not. Spidey, get him to Bruce.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came over the coms just as he blasted a group of agents. Bobbing his head, Peter slung Clint\u2019s left arm over his shoulders as they made their way out of the base. On their way out, they encountered Natasha battling three agents. Noticing Peter hesitate, torn between getting Clint out or helping Natasha, she quickly shocked him out of his stupor by yelling at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGo! Get him to safety, I\u2019ve got this!\u201d Knowing that she was right and not to protest, he quickly continued making his way out of the base. Approaching the exit, he pushed open the door an was blinded by sunlight. As he blinked to clear his vision, he saw Iron Man flying high in the sky, looking over the base. He hobbled pass Steve and Scott, the former who was waving him towards the jet and the latter shrinking and enlarging, throwing enemy agents all over the place. Giving the captain a nod, he quickly made his way into the woods where the jet was sitting in a clearing. He made it to his destination, seeing the back opened and Bruce running out, slinging Clint\u2019s right arm over his shoulders and putting pressure on the wound with his left hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As they made their way into the jet, Bruce began gathering materials and interrogating both heroes. \u201cHow\u2019d he get injured?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Breathing out, Peter answered as honestly as he could. \u201cNot sure. Wasn\u2019t with him. I only heard him after he was hurt and when I rounded the corner he was holding his side.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAh, I\u2019d say, thirty minutes give or take.\u201d Just as he finished the sentence, Bruce had peeled Clint\u2019s vest off of him, and gave a low whistle.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cStab wound. You\u2019re quite lucky,\u201d the doctor remarked as he quickly cleaned the wound and disinfected it, \u201cany higher, and it could have pierced your lung.\u201d Clint only gave a grunt in return and hissed as he started to stitch it up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re coming in. Base has been cleared out. Spidey, you got those files?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice came over the intercoms.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOh! Yeah! Ye-yep, they\u2019re right uhh, right here!\u201d He quickly raised his hand after patting down his form, having forgotten he\u2019d webbed the flash drive to his hip.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. How bout we blow this popsicle stand, huh?\u201d Tony questioned as he landed in the jet, suit retracting, Natasha and Steve not far behind.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Just as Peter opened his mouth to reply, he was hit with a wave of nausea. Stumbling to the left, Steve quickly caught his arm, brows furrowed. \u201cYou okay son?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYeah I just-\u201c he stopped himself by keeling over and breaking into a fit of coughing. Alarmed, Tony and Natasha rushed over, followed by Bruce who had just finished cleaning Clint\u2019s stab wound up. Ripping off his mask so he could breath better, Peter put his hands on the ground and struggled to take a breath.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cKid! Peter! Whats going on?\u201d Tony asked, quite concerned and worried for his kid. Natasha reached forward, putting her hand on his forehead when the coughing stopped before retracting with a hiss.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s burning up. We need to cool him down, <i>now.\u201d </i>Scott immediately ran to the back of the jet and returned with a cool washcloth, putting it on Peter\u2019s head. Just as he was about to protest that he was fine, when his muscles suddenly locked up and started to spasm.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Tony cried out in alarm as Peter fell to the floor, fall broken by Bruce shoving his hands under his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s having a seizure. Scott! Start timing it. Tony, get us to the tower. Nat, call Cho. Steve, help me move him,\u201d Each hero scrambled to follow his instructions, worried for their youngest member. When Steve got Peter into a better spot, without harming him, Bruce set him on his side so he could breath better, and pulled off his jacket, putting it under Peter\u2019s head so he didn\u2019t cause any head injuries.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As the Quinjet was speeding toward New York, Bruce worriedly looked down at Peter who was still seizing.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cScott. Time.\u201d Scott looked down at his watch and with an alarmed look replied,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFour minutes thirty seven seconds.\u201d This was bad. The seizure didn\u2019t look like it was stopping soon, and if it surpassed five minutes, they were in serious trouble. As soon as Scott\u2019s timer hit five minutes, he alarmed the scientist who then turned towards Tony, who was piloting the jet, and yelled in the most terrified voice any of them had ever heard.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFly faster!\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can post part two if anyone wants more.

Everything&rsquo;s been going good, so what happens when his decathlon team shows up?</i></p><hr /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter wasn&rsquo;t really having a great day. Or week. Come to think of it, its been a pretty shi-crappy, sorry Cap, past few weeks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It all started when Peter and the team, Bucky and Loki included as they were now part of the team, were lounging about in the Avengers living room. He was sprawled across one of the many worn-in leather couches with his head in Loki&rsquo;s lap and legs in Bucky&rsquo;s. Tony, his adoptive father, was sat in a loveseat conversing with Bruce who was on the armchair. Natasha was sat criss cross on the floor below Peter. Clint was on the footrest. Thor was on the couch to their left next to Steve, both of whom were comparing Earth&rsquo;s politics to Asgard&rsquo;s. Sam was in the connecting kitchen talking to Scott while making hot chocolate. Rhodey was on another couch with Vision, who was cuddling Wanda, all of whom were watching whatever TV program was on. (It was Dance Moms.)</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a lazy day in SI - Tony ended up not selling the tower after the whole Homecoming fiasco and the team now lived there, but still regularly went to the compound (but don&rsquo;t tell anyone it was mainly for Peter) - There were no missions, no school, and most importantly, no alien invaders.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Peter had his eyes closed, nodding off as Loki threaded his hand through his hair and Bucky had his cool metal arm across his legs. Just as he were about to fall asleep, a loud alarm rang throughout the room interrupting the soft chatter, and thoroughly startling the spiderling into a sitting position, at which Loki gave a noise of protest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Annoyed at the interruption, all present company looked towards the dining table to see a hologram that had popped up saying &lsquo;INCOMING CALL: EYE PATCH&rdquo;. Grumbling, Tony gave an exasperated sigh and said, &ldquo;JARV? Accept please. May as well get it over with.&rdquo; The hologram then gave-way to a rather, ahem, <i>upset </i>looking Nick Fury.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Glaring, the bald one eyed directer started to talk. &ldquo;Avengers. We have a HYDRA threat that needs to be neutralized. All the information needed is being sent as we speak. Fury, out.&rdquo; And with that, Nick Fury ended the call.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Giving an over-dramatized sigh, Clint threw his head back and stood from the footrest. &ldquo;And here I was, hoping to get absolutely nothing done today.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; So here they were now, at one of the last remaining HYDRA bases. This one was on an offshore island. It was relatively small, and not well guarded. Since it was so small, only a handful of Avengers had to come. Spiderman was to get in, disable the security system, and recover all files. Ironman was more or less back up, but he provided air support. Black Widow was to enter along with Hawkeye after the security system was disabled and takedown any agents. Captain America stood guarding the main exit, also taking down any agents that somehow got outside. (There were none.) Bruce was in the Quinjet on standby for medical purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was supposed to be simple, Quick. In and out.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But then everything went to shit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Webs! Head in through the top window and disable the security.&rdquo; Tony said through the coms. &ldquo;Careful, theres electricity two feet below the ceiling. Don&rsquo;t want a fried bug.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Giving a fake offended gasp, Peter started to crawl up the side of the brick building. &ldquo;I am offended! Spiders are arachnids, not bugs!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Just get in and do the job!&rdquo; Steve stated, not unkindly, as he just wanted to get the job done. Grumbling, Peter followed the commands and went inside. He immediately felt the buzzing electricity underneath him that was making his senses go crazy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Alarmed, Peter whispered into the coms, &ldquo;Hey guys, this electricity is making my senses go crazy. Im not gonna be able to detect any incoming danger&rdquo;. At this, Clint gave a small curse and replied,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry bug. Tasha and I will be watching you.&rdquo; Too on edge to correct the archer, Peter started to crawl across the ceiling as flat as he could go. All was silent over the coms as he made his way throughout the base and to the security room. Looking down, or was it up, Peter saw three HYDRA agents below him, manning the computers. Luckily for him, there was no electricity in this room but his senses were still going crazy over it, so he was able to silently drop down behind the agents. Acting fast, he shot his arms to the sides and webbed the two agents on the sided and slammed their heads into the one in the middle. They all went down.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Shaking his arms out and jumping Peter gave a relieved sigh. &ldquo;Phew! I thought I would never get out of there!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Good job kid. Now get those security systems down.&rdquo; Tony commanded, as they had to hurry to attract minimum attention.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Right! Right.&rdquo; He darted forward and his finger started flying across the keypads. Only a couple minutes later did he get them down. Throwing his arms up he exclaimed, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re down!&rdquo; He then started to hack in and retrieve the files.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That was when the chaos started.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A few minutes later as he was distracted, he did not notice the HYDRA agent sneaking up on him from behind until his senses went off at the last moment. He whirled around and was met with a face full of chemicals. Spluttering, he waved his hands around to try and disperse it, but he inevitably breathed it in. When his sight cleared, he saw the agent still in front of him, and quickly incapacitated the man.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Spider-Man! Are you alright?&rdquo; Natasha&rsquo;s concerned voice came through his coms.

I'll post chapter by chapter, BUT also have all the finished chapters posted under the \"The Stories\" link below.  Feedback is appreciated - even POLITE criticism.  Have fun (and yes, there are ADULT chapters)!  <br><Br>\n\n    <form onsubmit=\"return tagSearch(this)\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"tag\" value=\"Search My Blog\" onfocus=\"if (this.value == '{text:Search Label}') {this.value=''}\" onblur=\"if (this.value == '') {this.value='{text:Search Label}'}\" />\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Search\" />\n    </form>",
