The unease, which has settled in your stomach like a bite of a fruit that wasn\u2019t quite ripe yet, has prevented you from doing anything truly productive throughout the course of the day. The anxiety had build up inside you, as you knew (and still do know) that the answer is not <i>if</i>, but <i>when</i>. </p><p>\tYou pass by a mirror in your front porch, catching a brief glance of your appearance. You pause, and then take a step back to review your appearance in more detail. Your reflection looks you back in the eye, and you take note of all your features. Your eyes, which have the same gleam of your father, framed by your face, which resembles that of your mother. </p><!-- more --><p><i>\tYou look so much like your mother!</i> It was a phrase to which you had become intimately familiar, heard since you were a young child. It was a phrase that had once meant nothing, then had meant something, and had then become a phrase you never wanted to hear again. Of course, you love your mother, but the phrase had only reminded you often of the facial structure you didn\u2019t possess, the facial structure that you had desperately craved as a teenager. </p><p>\tThose thoughts didn\u2019t sit well. You turn away from the mirror, suddenly unable to ignore the lump in your stomach, which has turned to boiling liquid. The words, that phrase, linger in your head like a bitter aftertaste. </p><p>\tYou gently set your bag down on the floor, making sure to not damage the items that it holds, before making your way to your couch. You place a hand on your chest, feeling your pulse - which feels as if it\u2019s going to burst out of your chest - and to slow your breathing. Trying to distract yourself of the tenseness of your own body, your brain hyper-aware of every inch of your skin, you turn on the television. </p><p>\tThe noise and the light of the screen do nothing to draw you into your surroundings and out of your own skin. You want desperately to concentrate on whatever is passing in the show, but your brain can\u2019t escape the intensity of how wrong your body feels. You are only able to concentrate on your chest, and how tight the layers of clothing appear to be. You stop trying to conceal your discomfort and you begin to involuntarily shake. </p><p>You lean over, placing your head on a pillow, and allow the tears to flow freely from your eyes. A sob makes its way past your lips, but is swallowed by the surrounding noise from the television. You hadn&rsquo;t realized how loud it actually was. Your shaking hand reaches the remote to turn it off. </p><p>The sound of the door opening alerts you momentarily to your surroundings. You realize a second later that Steve has arrived home.

It was a phrase that had once meant nothing, then had meant something, and had then become a phrase you never wanted to hear again.

You nod quickly, and then lean over to rest your head on his shoulder. He wraps his arm around your back, and he begins to gently draw circles on your skin with the tips of his fingers. You burst into tears again. </p><p>Steve kisses your forehead gently, rocking you back and forth, but it doesn&rsquo;t help much. You&rsquo;re still feeling uncomfortable and miserable, and while his presence is comforting, you just want to escape. Steve&rsquo;s breathing is calm and steady, and you focus your mind to concentrate only on that. Your heart is still beating furiously in your chest, but you&rsquo;ve managed to stop sobbing. The tears are pouring silently out of your eyes now. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; Steve whispers, placing a hand on the back of your head. When you flinch to the feeling, his hand retracts. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; you say between rushed breaths. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he responds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p>You lift your head from his shoulder to then press it into his chest, feeling his heartbeat. You remark that your tears have caused his shirt to become damp. You close your eyes and feel his beating heart as his arm, wrapped around your back, continues to gently trace circles into your skin. </p><p>The two of you stay there for what feels like an eternity to you, until you raise your head and look him in the eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you feeling better?&rdquo; he asks you. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you murmur, suddenly exhausted. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo; he asks you, his eyes betraying a hint of worry for you. </p><p>&ldquo;I, I just &hellip;&rdquo; you trail off, your tongue feeling like lead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so hard. I hate that this happens. I hate that I can&rsquo;t avoid it. I hate that I have to deal with this - it doesn&rsquo;t seem fair. It&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he says, closing his eyes and leaning his forehead against yours. &ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you sorry?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t do more for you. I don&rsquo;t want to see you in pain - you don&rsquo;t deserve it. You&rsquo;re my boyfriend, and I love you. You make me so happy, and I hate that I can&rsquo;t always do the same.&rdquo; </p><p>A smile crosses your lips. &ldquo;You do make me happy. You make me so, so happy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But what about times like this, Y/N? Where you&rsquo;re alone, and in pain?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about me, Steve. I&rsquo;ve dealt with this myself so many times.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But what if I want to help you?&rdquo;</p><p>You chuckle and lean your head against his chest. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a hero.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that such a bad thing?&rdquo; </p><hr /><p>Author&rsquo;s Note: Yay, first fic!

The unease, which has settled in your stomach like a bite of a fruit that wasn&rsquo;t quite ripe yet, has prevented you from doing anything truly productive throughout the course of the day. The anxiety had build up inside you, as you knew (and still do know) that the answer is not <i>if</i>, but <i>when</i>. </p>\n<p>\tYou pass by a mirror in your front porch, catching a brief glance of your appearance.
