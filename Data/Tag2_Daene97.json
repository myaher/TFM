In a small box carved from the oldest  weirwood tree in all of Westeros - according to Magister Illyrio who  presented it to her on her thirteenth name day - Dany had kept a few of  the many gifts given to her unborn son. It was a lovely yet painful  reminder of what could and should have been.</p><p>\u00a0<i>Her stallion meant to mount the world\u2026 </i></p><p>There was a pair of soft leather booties her handmaiden Doreah  had sewn. His tiny feet would have fit them so well. A belt made of  solid gold medallions \u2013 a gift from Khal Ogo and his <i>khalasar</i> -  would run through her fingers with every tender caress. It would have  been too big for her baby, but he would eventually grow into it. His  first gold ring \u2013a present from his father \u2013 sat gleaming at the bottom  of the box. Her stallion would have worn it in his hair after his first  name day; the beginning of his reign as the son of the <i>khal</i>.  Last was a finely carved rattle of ivory; or at least it was supposed to  be a rattle though it had an odd shape \u2013 like a miniature <i>arakh</i> but not quite. One of the crones from the <i>dosh khaleen</i> had made it, and it was believed to have powers to keep her son from all harm.</p><p><i>Lies, lies, and more lies,</i> she thought with the sharp tang of bitterness still heavy on her tongue.</p><p>Yet,  hadn\u2019t she once clung to those lies with the desperation of a young  girl seeking to find her worth in a world foreign and frightening? She  had sought love wherever she could find it; having received none from  her last living relative and oblivious to the kind Jorah was willing to  give. It was terrible to think being pregnant for a man like Drogo, had  made her feel she was actually more useful than just being a \u2018trophy  bride\u2019. It made her endless days of drudgery and resigned fear more  palatable.</p><p>Unfortunately, her condition did nothing to decrease  his insatiable sexual appetite, for he wasn\u2019t averse to taking her  whenever he felt like it. If anything, seeing her with child made her  even more desirable, he admitted after another night of pumping her full  of his sticky seed until it trickled down her thighs. She told herself  she relished in the gleam of pride in his dark eyes and was pleased when  he praised her for being so strong. Like a true <i>khaleesi</i>.</p><p><i>Moon of my life,</i> he would whisper as he suckled hard on her full and tender breasts until they hurt.</p><p><i>My sun and stars,</i>  she\u2019d reply with tears in her eyes as she stared blankly at the ceiling  and tried not to think of her belly throbbing in agony or how heavy and  sweaty he felt against her weary body.</p><p>After all, the blood of the dragon flowed through her, and she could withstand any suffering.</p><p>She  should have guessed something would go terribly wrong when those  throbbing pains became even more pronounced in the latter months of her  pregnancy. Drogo wasn\u2019t helping with his constant need to keep moving  from one place to another; to keep track of his assets and influx of  revenue he\u2019d argue. It was the Dothraki custom, no matter how many times  the doctor had warned for her not to travel so much.</p><p><i>She can remain in Vaes Dothrak until you return,</i> he would advise. <i>She is already fragile as it is. Traveling such far distances does not help.</i></p><p>Unfortunately for the poor doctor, no one dared argue with the <i>khal</i>  especially when he was dead set on his unborn son being a stallion or  warrior. He was not going to be weak, and his wife had better be on the  next fucking plane to wherever the hell he was going next. Even Jorah,  despite his high esteem in Drogo\u2019s eyes, could not convince the <i>khal</i> otherwise.</p><p><i>I am the dragon\u2019s daughter,</i> she would tell herself with every agonizing step she tried to mask with a strained smile. <i>The stallion who mounts the world is within me, and he will be as strong as his father.</i></p><p>The  bleeding started somewhere between the flight from Lhazarene to Qohor,  and at first she had slept right through the familiar pangs of pain  until Jhiqui\u2019s shriek of terror awakened her. She can still remember  staring dumbly at the lower half of her body; almost marveling at how  thick and heavy the blood was. She was literally drenched in it, and  even as her handmaidens ran around the tiny cabin trying to clean and  stop the damage, Dany had felt the first stirrings of dissociation take a  hold of her.</p><p><i>\u00a0I failed. </i></p><p>She watched a version of herself still frozen in the bed; her  body simply being pulled this way and that by the sobbing women she also  considered friends. Her face was remarkably without emotion; not a  single tear dripping down her cheek. Her violet gaze was distant and  empty; as barren as the womb that once contained a life.</p><p><i>\u00a0No longer. No longer. </i></p><p>She could see Drogo dashing inside with his features distraught; a  sight she never thought she\u2019d ever see on that handsome proud face.  Dany watched as he hugged her shell, muttering words in Dothraki that  sounded like he was sorry, oh-so-terribly sorry\u2026as he should be.</p><p><i>You killed him, </i>a tiny voice whispered with icy venom that was frightening. <i>You  and your fucking selfish desires. You killed our baby, and I\u2019m glad.  I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead, because you don\u2019t deserve to be a father.</i></p><p>She might have returned to her body eventually, but everything else after that was a blur. <i>Life</i>  became a blur; a meaningless motion of activities that were of no real  concern to her. Oh she would hear the whispers as she walked by; how the  other women would give looks of pity or disdain. And though her <i>khas</i>  still treated her with respect reserved for her position, there was an  underlying simmer of resentment at her failure to fulfill her most  important of duties. What use was she to anyone? What was her purpose?</p><p>Jorah  \u2013 dear Jorah \u2013 did his best to keep her spirits up. He would read to  her and keep her updated on what was going on in other parts of the  world. Her handmaidens did the same; bringing her fine clothing and  perfumes from the next town or city they stopped at. Drogo, for his  part, became somewhat distant. Losing a son was not exactly considered a  crowning moment for a <i>khal</i> of his stature, and rumors swirled  that he was already looking for a replacement for his barren bride. He  did come to visit her bedroom once in a while, but she could and would  not speak more than a few words to him; polite responses to his almost  robotic queries about her day.</p><p><i>He no longer cares.</i> </p><p>The nights were the worst. It was the time she could finally be  alone to think, and her thoughts were almost always a mixture of  melancholic regrets or vicious vengeance on those responsible for her  nightmares. How many times had she pictured driving an <i>arakh </i> into Drogo\u2019s back whenever he came to take her? He didn\u2019t seem to mind  that she simply lay like a dead fish as he buried himself to the hilt as  if hoping to impregnate her all over again.</p><p>His seed was strong. It <i>had</i> to be strong, he would grunt with each feverish thrust. He was the goddamn <i>khal</i> of one of the greatest <i>khalasars</i>  ever. His pride had taken a tremendous blow with her failure, and he  would not accept defeat that easily. He would fuck her into the ground  if it meant she produce an heir for him.</p><p>Two more years of this, and she finally had enough.</p><p>He knew. She knew.</p><p>She had absolutely nothing left to give.</p><p>\u201cFound it!\u201d came the happy sound to rattle her gloomy thoughts.</p><p>Monterys  Velaryon was running back to her with what appeared to be a large black  and red striped toad in his hands. His lilac eyes glowed with victory  and there was a smug smile of satisfaction on his somewhat effeminate  features. Despite the raincoat she had made him wear, his fair hair was  drenched with flecks of mud stuck on it. The rest of him was no better,  and Dany could already picture the fight they were going to have over  him taking a shower later.</p><p><i>\u00a0Ah boys.  </i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026nice,\u201d she said with a smile as the ugly creature croaked  in protest at being manhandled. The boy had been chasing it along the  marshes for a while, and perhaps it finally got tired and allowed  the human to have its way for now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naming him Daemon!\u201d  Monterys announced with a flourish. He pet the toad\u2019s head tenderly and  grinned at Dany. \u201cCan I keep him, Aunt Dany? Pretty please?\u201d</p><p>Dany  took a deep breath. The idea of having a toad running around the castle  was not exactly appealing, but since she had agreed to let Lord  Velaryon\u2019s son spend the weekend\u2026how could she say \u2018no\u2019 to that face?  Like Dany, his mother had passed away at childbirth and though Lord  Velaryon did his best to raise him, it was clear his young son craved  the attention of a mother-figure in his life. Monterys knew he had Dany  wrapped around his finger, and he could probably get away with murder at  this rate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Jorah find a suitable cage or something for  him,\u201d Dany finally replied, unable to help chuckling as Monterys hugged  her leg in gratitude.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Aunt Dany! I\u2019m going to  show Missandei!\u201d he said in delight as he ran off to look for her best  friend, who was probably still haggling over a lovely handmade bracelet  she had noticed in the window of the only trinket shop around.</p><p>\u201cBe  careful!\u201d Dany called out, though she might as well be talking to the  wind for the kid was already halfway down the slope and heading toward  the flickering lights of the village below.</p><p><i>If Rhaego was still alive\u2026you two might have been the best of friends. </i></p><p>But then again, if Rhaego was still alive, she wouldn\u2019t be here today, would she?</p><p>Shaking  away that depressing thought, she dug her hands into the pockets of her  raincoat and continued to walk along the muddy shore; her rubber boots  nearly getting stuck in some places with how deep the muck was. The  rains had now become a light drizzle, which gave the evening a heavy  damp ambience that was ripe for warm cups of cocoa before a roaring  fire. However, she had chosen to spend most of the day in the villages;  getting to meet the people and properly introducing herself to the  curious ones.</p><p>It was a humbling experience \u2013 almost akin to her  trips around the slums of Meereen, Astapor, and Yunkai. There were no  adequate words to describe the gratification one received from being in  the presence of smallfolk. Many were unpretentious and kind; men, women,  and children who simply wanted to live in peace with no concern for  kings and queens. They were worried about where their next meal was  coming from, or how well their crops would grow in the next harvest  season, or how much fish they would be able to catch and sell to  neighboring islands. They believed in fair democracy, and many of the  men would love to chat about just what they <i>really</i> thought of  the Lannisters. The older ones didn\u2019t exactly have favorable stories to  tell of her father, Aerys, but many did believe her brother Rhaegar  might have changed things for the better. There was universal praise for  he and her mother, who like Dany, would sometimes come down to the  village to sup with the smallfolk or play with the children.</p><p>Hearing  such stories warmed Dany\u2019s heart and made her feel a little closer to a  family and home she once felt alienated from. The more tales she heard  about Rhaella, the more she came to love and admire a mother she had  never really known.</p><p>Maester Pylos had taken her on a tour of the  only school in town. It was a rundown two-story building divided into  sections. The first floor was for the pre-school to middle-school age  children, while the top half was basically the high-school. With about a  hundred children in all, there were only so many adults willing to  offer their time as school teachers. Six to be exact.</p><p>\u201cWe have two  student-teachers that come all the way from King\u2019s Landing and teach  Mathematics and History,\u201d Pylos explained in his small and cluttered  office. \u201cUnfortunately, they have to return home every weekend. They  receive no pay and do this voluntarily which is a blessing.\u201d</p><p>Indeed  it was. They weren\u2019t nearly enough books for everyone, and some  students had to share with others. There wasn\u2019t enough equipment to  adequately teach some subjects, especially the Sciences, and the only  computer in the building belonged to the Maester, who had to also act as  secretary and receptionist in addition to being the administrator.</p><p>Missandei  \u2013 who had followed for this excursion - had kept notes of everything  Dany wanted improved. By the end of the year, she expected the building  to be renovated and every classroom to have enough books and equipment  for their students. She had also spoken to Lord Velaryon about the  abysmal situation, slightly offended that he would rather see a  neighboring island struggle, while his flourished.</p><p><i>As long as you are now here, my Queen,</i> he had promised sheepishly, <i>Driftmark will do its best to provide whatever services you require.</i></p><p>In  fact, first thing in the morning, he was sending some of his best  architects and engineers to see to the renovations and possible  construction of new buildings to expand the school. In addition, she had  also implored the services of her alliances from Claw Isle, Cape Wrath,  Sharp Point, and Sweetport Sound. They, too, were willing to send in  whatever support she needed. It was safe to say that the once lonesome  port of Dragonstone was now seeing an increase in traffic since the  return of the Targaryen heiress.</p><p>Word was spreading.</p><p><i>And favors expected along with it,</i>  Dany thought with a rueful smile as she studied the looming volcanic  mountains of Dragonmont. They were so high, they seemed lost in the  clouds; not that the thick curtain of smoke was helping matters. It was  no wonder it rained so much around here. It was making the castle\u2019s roof  repairs a slow process, but at least most of the electricity had  returned and there was hot water. Two basic necessities covered.</p><p>From  here, the castle seemed to have been carved from the mountains itself.  Tucked between two towering peaks, it was probably designed that way so  enemies would find it difficult to attack from all sides. Dragonstone  was created to meet possible threats from the sea, and no army was  foolish enough to try traversing the jagged slopes of mountains capable  of erupting at any moment. For a land that was supposedly unstable,  there had been no reports of activity in centuries, and Dragonstone and  its people have survived this long with no major incidents.</p><p><i>May it remain that way for a long time to come\u2026whaaa?</i> </p><p>There was a sudden flash of light to her right, and she turned to  see Missandei beaming at her. She had taken a photo with her cellphone.</p><p>\u201cFor  your Illustrogram page,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cYou looked so good  staring at the mountains like that. You had a regal expression on your  face. Your followers are going to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that even mean?\u201d Dany asked with a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t go about trying to look regal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou  don\u2019t have to,\u201d her friend replied as she placed a kiss on Dany\u2019s lips  before engulfing her in a warm hug. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural queen.\u201d</p><p>Dany blushed and hugged back; while fighting the sting of tears threatening to fall. How she loved and appreciated this woman.</p><p>\u201cA  queen needs her king though, for the nights can get loooonely,\u201d came  the mischievous words which had Dany almost as red as a tomato at  Missandei\u2019s implication. She had done her best not to think about a  certain someone all day, and now\u2026</p><p>\u201cStooop,\u201d Dany whined and pulled away with a pout and roll of her eyes. <i>The gods damn her.</i></p><p>Monterys  was back, though he appeared to be poking at something in the grass  with a stick. She wondered what weird creature he was hunting for now.  Besides, it was time to head back to the castle. His septa \u2013 though glad  for a moment to put her feet up \u2013 would probably be worried sick about  the young master.</p><p>\u201cCome on Monterys,\u201d she called out; glad for the  distraction and an opportunity to avoid speaking about Jon. \u201cLet\u2019s go  home. Almost dinner time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! Are we having chicken nuggets tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dany replied with a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a proper meal, young man. No more of that frozen stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww,\u201d  Monterys protested and stomped his foot; sending more mud flying into  his hair in the process. Daemon, the toad, croaked within the pocket  of his raincoat, and the boy did his best to appease his new pet. \u201cI  wonder if Daemon likes nuggets.\u201d</p><p>Missandei rubbed her chin in mock thought. \u201cI guess we could find out.\u201d</p><p>Dany was shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell how about this,\u201d Missandei appeased. \u201cYou eat your veggies and you can have two chicken nuggets\u2026plus one for Daemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,  you can go study up on what frogs like to eat,\u201d Dany added with an arms  folded across her chest. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep a pet like that you  have to learn more about him, right?\u201d</p><p>Monterys nodded. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the library and find books about frogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd  if you can tell me at least two fascinating things about them,\u201d Dany  added with a smile. \u201cYou can have nuggets for breakfast too.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have promised him anything better, for with a yelp of delight, the boy was off and running toward the castle.</p><p>\u201cOne  of these days, he\u2019s going to fall and break his neck and then I\u2019ll have  a civil war on my hands,\u201d Dany said with a groan. \u201cMaybe then I\u2019ll  really have to marry Lord Velaryon to make peace.\u201d</p><p>Missandei  laughed and slipped her arm through Dany\u2019s as they walked back to the  castle together. \u201cHe\u2019s actually easy on the eyes. Only in his early  forties, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d Dany replied with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I forgot. You\u2019re holding out for a certain northerner who keeps getting himself in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Dany shook her head and looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that at all. We\u2019re\u2026friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuuuure,\u201d Missandei replied with a smirk. \u201cSo\u2026when are you going to call your <i>friend</i> again? It\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it? He should be home by now\u2026at least according to Lord Varys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll  call me when he\u2019s ready. Sam still has his private cellphone, remember?  I doubt he\u2019ll want to use his personal phone at this time. Too risky.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F12292536%2Fchapters%2F29288088%23workskin&amp;t=Yzk1NTg0MmQyNzUyNWY0N2EwNmNhZTE1NzdkNTE4ZmI3ZDYwMTNhOSw0MDU1MjZhNTQ5NzQyNzllZTg3MWY2NGRkNDIxOTRmZDkzZWZjM2Qx\">Eye of the Storm - Chapter 17</a></p>",

Her handmaidens did the same; bringing her fine clothing and  perfumes from the next town or city they stopped at. Drogo, for his  part, became somewhat distant. Losing a son was not exactly considered a  crowning moment for a <i>khal</i> of his stature, and rumors swirled  that he was already looking for a replacement for his barren bride. He  did come to visit her bedroom once in a while, but she could and would  not speak more than a few words to him; polite responses to his almost  robotic queries about her day.</p><p><i>He no longer cares.</i> </p><p>The nights were the worst. It was the time she could finally be  alone to think, and her thoughts were almost always a mixture of  melancholic regrets or vicious vengeance on those responsible for her  nightmares. How many times had she pictured driving an <i>arakh </i> into Drogo\u2019s back whenever he came to take her? He didn\u2019t seem to mind  that she simply lay like a dead fish as he buried himself to the hilt as  if hoping to impregnate her all over again.</p><p>His seed was strong. It <i>had</i> to be strong, he would grunt with each feverish thrust. He was the goddamn <i>khal</i> of one of the greatest <i>khalasars</i>  ever. His pride had taken a tremendous blow with her failure, and he  would not accept defeat that easily. He would fuck her into the ground  if it meant she produce an heir for him.</p><p>Two more years of this, and she finally had enough.</p><p>He knew. She knew.</p><p>She had absolutely nothing left to give.</p><p>\u201cFound it!\u201d came the happy sound to rattle her gloomy thoughts.</p><p>Monterys  Velaryon was running back to her with what appeared to be a large black  and red striped toad in his hands. His lilac eyes glowed with victory  and there was a smug smile of satisfaction on his somewhat effeminate  features. Despite the raincoat she had made him wear, his fair hair was  drenched with flecks of mud stuck on it. The rest of him was no better,  and Dany could already picture the fight they were going to have over  him taking a shower later.</p><p><i>\u00a0Ah boys.  </i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026nice,\u201d she said with a smile as the ugly creature croaked  in protest at being manhandled. The boy had been chasing it along the  marshes for a while, and perhaps it finally got tired and allowed  the human to have its way for now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naming him Daemon!\u201d  Monterys announced with a flourish. He pet the toad\u2019s head tenderly and  grinned at Dany. \u201cCan I keep him, Aunt Dany? Pretty please?\u201d</p><p>Dany  took a deep breath. The idea of having a toad running around the castle  was not exactly appealing, but since she had agreed to let Lord  Velaryon\u2019s son spend the weekend\u2026how could she say \u2018no\u2019 to that face?  Like Dany, his mother had passed away at childbirth and though Lord  Velaryon did his best to raise him, it was clear his young son craved  the attention of a mother-figure in his life. Monterys knew he had Dany  wrapped around his finger, and he could probably get away with murder at  this rate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Jorah find a suitable cage or something for  him,\u201d Dany finally replied, unable to help chuckling as Monterys hugged  her leg in gratitude.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Aunt Dany! I\u2019m going to  show Missandei!\u201d he said in delight as he ran off to look for her best  friend, who was probably still haggling over a lovely handmade bracelet  she had noticed in the window of the only trinket shop around.</p><p>\u201cBe  careful!\u201d Dany called out, though she might as well be talking to the  wind for the kid was already halfway down the slope and heading toward  the flickering lights of the village below.</p><p><i>If Rhaego was still alive\u2026you two might have been the best of friends. </i></p><p>But then again, if Rhaego was still alive, she wouldn\u2019t be here today, would she?</p><p>Shaking  away that depressing thought, she dug her hands into the pockets of her  raincoat and continued to walk along the muddy shore; her rubber boots  nearly getting stuck in some places with how deep the muck was. The  rains had now become a light drizzle, which gave the evening a heavy  damp ambience that was ripe for warm cups of cocoa before a roaring  fire. However, she had chosen to spend most of the day in the villages;  getting to meet the people and properly introducing herself to the  curious ones.</p><p>It was a humbling experience \u2013 almost akin to her  trips around the slums of Meereen, Astapor, and Yunkai. There were no  adequate words to describe the gratification one received from being in  the presence of smallfolk. Many were unpretentious and kind; men, women,  and children who simply wanted to live in peace with no concern for  kings and queens. They were worried about where their next meal was  coming from, or how well their crops would grow in the next harvest  season, or how much fish they would be able to catch and sell to  neighboring islands. They believed in fair democracy, and many of the  men would love to chat about just what they <i>really</i> thought of  the Lannisters. The older ones didn\u2019t exactly have favorable stories to  tell of her father, Aerys, but many did believe her brother Rhaegar  might have changed things for the better. There was universal praise for  he and her mother, who like Dany, would sometimes come down to the  village to sup with the smallfolk or play with the children.</p><p>Hearing  such stories warmed Dany\u2019s heart and made her feel a little closer to a  family and home she once felt alienated from. The more tales she heard  about Rhaella, the more she came to love and admire a mother she had  never really known.</p><p>Maester Pylos had taken her on a tour of the  only school in town. It was a rundown two-story building divided into  sections. The first floor was for the pre-school to middle-school age  children, while the top half was basically the high-school. With about a  hundred children in all, there were only so many adults willing to  offer their time as school teachers. Six to be exact.</p><p>\u201cWe have two  student-teachers that come all the way from King\u2019s Landing and teach  Mathematics and History,\u201d Pylos explained in his small and cluttered  office. \u201cUnfortunately, they have to return home every weekend. They  receive no pay and do this voluntarily which is a blessing.\u201d</p><p>Indeed  it was. They weren\u2019t nearly enough books for everyone, and some  students had to share with others. There wasn\u2019t enough equipment to  adequately teach some subjects, especially the Sciences, and the only  computer in the building belonged to the Maester, who had to also act as  secretary and receptionist in addition to being the administrator.</p><p>Missandei  \u2013 who had followed for this excursion - had kept notes of everything  Dany wanted improved. By the end of the year, she expected the building  to be renovated and every classroom to have enough books and equipment  for their students. She had also spoken to Lord Velaryon about the  abysmal situation, slightly offended that he would rather see a  neighboring island struggle, while his flourished.</p><p><i>As long as you are now here, my Queen,</i> he had promised sheepishly, <i>Driftmark will do its best to provide whatever services you require.</i></p><p>In  fact, first thing in the morning, he was sending some of his best  architects and engineers to see to the renovations and possible  construction of new buildings to expand the school. In addition, she had  also implored the services of her alliances from Claw Isle, Cape Wrath,  Sharp Point, and Sweetport Sound. They, too, were willing to send in  whatever support she needed. It was safe to say that the once lonesome  port of Dragonstone was now seeing an increase in traffic since the  return of the Targaryen heiress.</p><p>Word was spreading.</p><p><i>And favors expected along with it,</i>  Dany thought with a rueful smile as she studied the looming volcanic  mountains of Dragonmont. They were so high, they seemed lost in the  clouds; not that the thick curtain of smoke was helping matters. It was  no wonder it rained so much around here. It was making the castle\u2019s roof  repairs a slow process, but at least most of the electricity had  returned and there was hot water. Two basic necessities covered.</p><p>From  here, the castle seemed to have been carved from the mountains itself.  Tucked between two towering peaks, it was probably designed that way so  enemies would find it difficult to attack from all sides. Dragonstone  was created to meet possible threats from the sea, and no army was  foolish enough to try traversing the jagged slopes of mountains capable  of erupting at any moment. For a land that was supposedly unstable,  there had been no reports of activity in centuries, and Dragonstone and  its people have survived this long with no major incidents.</p><p><i>May it remain that way for a long time to come\u2026whaaa?</i> </p><p>There was a sudden flash of light to her right, and she turned to  see Missandei beaming at her. She had taken a photo with her cellphone.</p><p>\u201cFor  your Illustrogram page,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cYou looked so good  staring at the mountains like that. You had a regal expression on your  face. Your followers are going to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that even mean?\u201d Dany asked with a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t go about trying to look regal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou  don\u2019t have to,\u201d her friend replied as she placed a kiss on Dany\u2019s lips  before engulfing her in a warm hug. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural queen.\u201d</p><p>Dany blushed and hugged back; while fighting the sting of tears threatening to fall. How she loved and appreciated this woman.</p><p>\u201cA  queen needs her king though, for the nights can get loooonely,\u201d came  the mischievous words which had Dany almost as red as a tomato at  Missandei\u2019s implication. She had done her best not to think about a  certain someone all day, and now\u2026</p><p>\u201cStooop,\u201d Dany whined and pulled away with a pout and roll of her eyes. <i>The gods damn her.</i></p><p>Monterys  was back, though he appeared to be poking at something in the grass  with a stick. She wondered what weird creature he was hunting for now.  Besides, it was time to head back to the castle. His septa \u2013 though glad  for a moment to put her feet up \u2013 would probably be worried sick about  the young master.</p><p>\u201cCome on Monterys,\u201d she called out; glad for the  distraction and an opportunity to avoid speaking about Jon. \u201cLet\u2019s go  home. Almost dinner time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! Are we having chicken nuggets tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dany replied with a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a proper meal, young man. No more of that frozen stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww,\u201d  Monterys protested and stomped his foot; sending more mud flying into  his hair in the process. Daemon, the toad, croaked within the pocket  of his raincoat, and the boy did his best to appease his new pet. \u201cI  wonder if Daemon likes nuggets.\u201d</p><p>Missandei rubbed her chin in mock thought. \u201cI guess we could find out.\u201d</p><p>Dany was shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell how about this,\u201d Missandei appeased. \u201cYou eat your veggies and you can have two chicken nuggets\u2026plus one for Daemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,  you can go study up on what frogs like to eat,\u201d Dany added with an arms  folded across her chest. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep a pet like that you  have to learn more about him, right?\u201d</p><p>Monterys nodded. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the library and find books about frogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd  if you can tell me at least two fascinating things about them,\u201d Dany  added with a smile. \u201cYou can have nuggets for breakfast too.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have promised him anything better, for with a yelp of delight, the boy was off and running toward the castle.</p><p>\u201cOne  of these days, he\u2019s going to fall and break his neck and then I\u2019ll have  a civil war on my hands,\u201d Dany said with a groan. \u201cMaybe then I\u2019ll  really have to marry Lord Velaryon to make peace.\u201d</p><p>Missandei  laughed and slipped her arm through Dany\u2019s as they walked back to the  castle together. \u201cHe\u2019s actually easy on the eyes. Only in his early  forties, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d Dany replied with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I forgot. You\u2019re holding out for a certain northerner who keeps getting himself in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Dany shook her head and looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that at all. We\u2019re\u2026friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuuuure,\u201d Missandei replied with a smirk. \u201cSo\u2026when are you going to call your <i>friend</i> again? It\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it? He should be home by now\u2026at least according to Lord Varys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll  call me when he\u2019s ready. Sam still has his private cellphone, remember?  I doubt he\u2019ll want to use his personal phone at this time. Too risky.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F12292536%2Fchapters%2F29288088%23workskin&amp;t=Yzk1NTg0MmQyNzUyNWY0N2EwNmNhZTE1NzdkNTE4ZmI3ZDYwMTNhOSw0MDU1MjZhNTQ5NzQyNzllZTg3MWY2NGRkNDIxOTRmZDkzZWZjM2Qx\">Eye of the Storm - Chapter 17</a></p></p>",

I did stumble across this very poignant image of Emilia, and it reminded me of a chapter of \u2018Storm\u2019 which I am re-posting below. We stan a queen. That is all.)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"510\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/203d994d7af086d43e6c3804863c0d98/tumblr_inline_pou9omDxHo1rz3tj7_400.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"510\" data-orig-width=\"400\"></figure><p>He would have turned six today; her Rhaego that is.</p><p>His name  day was usually spent in solemn reflection, where she was content to  remain locked in her room looking through the priceless memories of a  child she had loved and lost. In a small box carved from the oldest  weirwood tree in all of Westeros - according to Magister Illyrio who  presented it to her on her thirteenth name day - Dany had kept a few of  the many gifts given to her unborn son. It was a lovely yet painful  reminder of what could and should have been.</p><p>\u00a0<i>Her stallion meant to mount the world\u2026 </i></p><p>There was a pair of soft leather booties her handmaiden Doreah  had sewn. His tiny feet would have fit them so well. A belt made of  solid gold medallions \u2013 a gift from Khal Ogo and his <i>khalasar</i> -  would run through her fingers with every tender caress. It would have  been too big for her baby, but he would eventually grow into it. His  first gold ring \u2013a present from his father \u2013 sat gleaming at the bottom  of the box. Her stallion would have worn it in his hair after his first  name day; the beginning of his reign as the son of the <i>khal</i>.  Last was a finely carved rattle of ivory; or at least it was supposed to  be a rattle though it had an odd shape \u2013 like a miniature <i>arakh</i> but not quite. One of the crones from the <i>dosh khaleen</i> had made it, and it was believed to have powers to keep her son from all harm.</p><p><i>Lies, lies, and more lies,</i> she thought with the sharp tang of bitterness still heavy on her tongue.</p><p>Yet,  hadn\u2019t she once clung to those lies with the desperation of a young  girl seeking to find her worth in a world foreign and frightening? She  had sought love wherever she could find it; having received none from  her last living relative and oblivious to the kind Jorah was willing to  give. It was terrible to think being pregnant for a man like Drogo, had  made her feel she was actually more useful than just being a \u2018trophy  bride\u2019. It made her endless days of drudgery and resigned fear more  palatable.</p><p>Unfortunately, her condition did nothing to decrease  his insatiable sexual appetite, for he wasn\u2019t averse to taking her  whenever he felt like it. If anything, seeing her with child made her  even more desirable, he admitted after another night of pumping her full  of his sticky seed until it trickled down her thighs. She told herself  she relished in the gleam of pride in his dark eyes and was pleased when  he praised her for being so strong. Like a true <i>khaleesi</i>.</p><p><i>Moon of my life,</i> he would whisper as he suckled hard on her full and tender breasts until they hurt.</p><p><i>My sun and stars,</i>  she\u2019d reply with tears in her eyes as she stared blankly at the ceiling  and tried not to think of her belly throbbing in agony or how heavy and  sweaty he felt against her weary body.</p><p>After all, the blood of the dragon flowed through her, and she could withstand any suffering.</p><p>She  should have guessed something would go terribly wrong when those  throbbing pains became even more pronounced in the latter months of her  pregnancy. Drogo wasn\u2019t helping with his constant need to keep moving  from one place to another; to keep track of his assets and influx of  revenue he\u2019d argue. It was the Dothraki custom, no matter how many times  the doctor had warned for her not to travel so much.</p><p><i>She can remain in Vaes Dothrak until you return,</i> he would advise. <i>She is already fragile as it is. Traveling such far distances does not help.</i></p><p>Unfortunately for the poor doctor, no one dared argue with the <i>khal</i>  especially when he was dead set on his unborn son being a stallion or  warrior. He was not going to be weak, and his wife had better be on the  next fucking plane to wherever the hell he was going next. Even Jorah,  despite his high esteem in Drogo\u2019s eyes, could not convince the <i>khal</i> otherwise.</p><p><i>I am the dragon\u2019s daughter,</i> she would tell herself with every agonizing step she tried to mask with a strained smile. <i>The stallion who mounts the world is within me, and he will be as strong as his father.</i></p><p>The  bleeding started somewhere between the flight from Lhazarene to Qohor,  and at first she had slept right through the familiar pangs of pain  until Jhiqui\u2019s shriek of terror awakened her. She can still remember  staring dumbly at the lower half of her body; almost marveling at how  thick and heavy the blood was. She was literally drenched in it, and  even as her handmaidens ran around the tiny cabin trying to clean and  stop the damage, Dany had felt the first stirrings of dissociation take a  hold of her.</p><p><i>\u00a0I failed. </i></p><p>She watched a version of herself still frozen in the bed; her  body simply being pulled this way and that by the sobbing women she also  considered friends. Her face was remarkably without emotion; not a  single tear dripping down her cheek. Her violet gaze was distant and  empty; as barren as the womb that once contained a life.</p><p><i>\u00a0No longer. No longer. </i></p><p>She could see Drogo dashing inside with his features distraught; a  sight she never thought she\u2019d ever see on that handsome proud face.  Dany watched as he hugged her shell, muttering words in Dothraki that  sounded like he was sorry, oh-so-terribly sorry\u2026as he should be.</p><p><i>You killed him, </i>a tiny voice whispered with icy venom that was frightening. <i>You  and your fucking selfish desires. You killed our baby, and I\u2019m glad.  I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead, because you don\u2019t deserve to be a father.</i></p><p>She might have returned to her body eventually, but everything else after that was a blur. <i>Life</i>  became a blur; a meaningless motion of activities that were of no real  concern to her. Oh she would hear the whispers as she walked by; how the  other women would give looks of pity or disdain. And though her <i>khas</i>  still treated her with respect reserved for her position, there was an  underlying simmer of resentment at her failure to fulfill her most  important of duties. What use was she to anyone? What was her purpose?</p><p>Jorah  \u2013 dear Jorah \u2013 did his best to keep her spirits up. He would read to  her and keep her updated on what was going on in other parts of the  world. Her handmaidens did the same; bringing her fine clothing and  perfumes from the next town or city they stopped at. Drogo, for his  part, became somewhat distant. Losing a son was not exactly considered a  crowning moment for a <i>khal</i> of his stature, and rumors swirled  that he was already looking for a replacement for his barren bride. He  did come to visit her bedroom once in a while, but she could and would  not speak more than a few words to him; polite responses to his almost  robotic queries about her day.</p><p><i>He no longer cares.</i> </p><p>The nights were the worst. It was the time she could finally be  alone to think, and her thoughts were almost always a mixture of  melancholic regrets or vicious vengeance on those responsible for her  nightmares. How many times had she pictured driving an <i>arakh </i> into Drogo\u2019s back whenever he came to take her? He didn\u2019t seem to mind  that she simply lay like a dead fish as he buried himself to the hilt as  if hoping to impregnate her all over again.</p><p>His seed was strong. It <i>had</i> to be strong, he would grunt with each feverish thrust. He was the goddamn <i>khal</i> of one of the greatest <i>khalasars</i>  ever. His pride had taken a tremendous blow with her failure, and he  would not accept defeat that easily. He would fuck her into the ground  if it meant she produce an heir for him.</p><p>Two more years of this, and she finally had enough.</p><p>He knew. She knew.</p><p>She had absolutely nothing left to give.</p><p>\u201cFound it!\u201d came the happy sound to rattle her gloomy thoughts.</p><p>Monterys  Velaryon was running back to her with what appeared to be a large black  and red striped toad in his hands. His lilac eyes glowed with victory  and there was a smug smile of satisfaction on his somewhat effeminate  features. Despite the raincoat she had made him wear, his fair hair was  drenched with flecks of mud stuck on it. The rest of him was no better,  and Dany could already picture the fight they were going to have over  him taking a shower later.</p><p><i>\u00a0Ah boys.  </i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026nice,\u201d she said with a smile as the ugly creature croaked  in protest at being manhandled. The boy had been chasing it along the  marshes for a while, and perhaps it finally got tired and allowed  the human to have its way for now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naming him Daemon!\u201d  Monterys announced with a flourish. He pet the toad\u2019s head tenderly and  grinned at Dany. \u201cCan I keep him, Aunt Dany? Pretty please?\u201d</p><p>Dany  took a deep breath. The idea of having a toad running around the castle  was not exactly appealing, but since she had agreed to let Lord  Velaryon\u2019s son spend the weekend\u2026how could she say \u2018no\u2019 to that face?  Like Dany, his mother had passed away at childbirth and though Lord  Velaryon did his best to raise him, it was clear his young son craved  the attention of a mother-figure in his life. Monterys knew he had Dany  wrapped around his finger, and he could probably get away with murder at  this rate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Jorah find a suitable cage or something for  him,\u201d Dany finally replied, unable to help chuckling as Monterys hugged  her leg in gratitude.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Aunt Dany! I\u2019m going to  show Missandei!\u201d he said in delight as he ran off to look for her best  friend, who was probably still haggling over a lovely handmade bracelet  she had noticed in the window of the only trinket shop around.</p><p>\u201cBe  careful!\u201d Dany called out, though she might as well be talking to the  wind for the kid was already halfway down the slope and heading toward  the flickering lights of the village below.</p><p><i>If Rhaego was still alive\u2026you two might have been the best of friends. </i></p><p>But then again, if Rhaego was still alive, she wouldn\u2019t be here today, would she?</p><p>Shaking  away that depressing thought, she dug her hands into the pockets of her  raincoat and continued to walk along the muddy shore; her rubber boots  nearly getting stuck in some places with how deep the muck was. The  rains had now become a light drizzle, which gave the evening a heavy  damp ambience that was ripe for warm cups of cocoa before a roaring  fire. However, she had chosen to spend most of the day in the villages;  getting to meet the people and properly introducing herself to the  curious ones.</p><p>It was a humbling experience \u2013 almost akin to her  trips around the slums of Meereen, Astapor, and Yunkai. There were no  adequate words to describe the gratification one received from being in  the presence of smallfolk. Many were unpretentious and kind; men, women,  and children who simply wanted to live in peace with no concern for  kings and queens. They were worried about where their next meal was  coming from, or how well their crops would grow in the next harvest  season, or how much fish they would be able to catch and sell to  neighboring islands. They believed in fair democracy, and many of the  men would love to chat about just what they <i>really</i> thought of  the Lannisters. The older ones didn\u2019t exactly have favorable stories to  tell of her father, Aerys, but many did believe her brother Rhaegar  might have changed things for the better. There was universal praise for  he and her mother, who like Dany, would sometimes come down to the  village to sup with the smallfolk or play with the children.</p><p>Hearing  such stories warmed Dany\u2019s heart and made her feel a little closer to a  family and home she once felt alienated from. The more tales she heard  about Rhaella, the more she came to love and admire a mother she had  never really known.</p><p>Maester Pylos had taken her on a tour of the  only school in town. It was a rundown two-story building divided into  sections. The first floor was for the pre-school to middle-school age  children, while the top half was basically the high-school. With about a  hundred children in all, there were only so many adults willing to  offer their time as school teachers. Six to be exact.</p><p>\u201cWe have two  student-teachers that come all the way from King\u2019s Landing and teach  Mathematics and History,\u201d Pylos explained in his small and cluttered  office. \u201cUnfortunately, they have to return home every weekend. They  receive no pay and do this voluntarily which is a blessing.\u201d</p><p>Indeed  it was. They weren\u2019t nearly enough books for everyone, and some  students had to share with others. There wasn\u2019t enough equipment to  adequately teach some subjects, especially the Sciences, and the only  computer in the building belonged to the Maester, who had to also act as  secretary and receptionist in addition to being the administrator.</p><p>Missandei  \u2013 who had followed for this excursion - had kept notes of everything  Dany wanted improved. By the end of the year, she expected the building  to be renovated and every classroom to have enough books and equipment  for their students. She had also spoken to Lord Velaryon about the  abysmal situation, slightly offended that he would rather see a  neighboring island struggle, while his flourished.</p><p><i>As long as you are now here, my Queen,</i> he had promised sheepishly, <i>Driftmark will do its best to provide whatever services you require.</i></p><p>In  fact, first thing in the morning, he was sending some of his best  architects and engineers to see to the renovations and possible  construction of new buildings to expand the school. In addition, she had  also implored the services of her alliances from Claw Isle, Cape Wrath,  Sharp Point, and Sweetport Sound. They, too, were willing to send in  whatever support she needed. It was safe to say that the once lonesome  port of Dragonstone was now seeing an increase in traffic since the  return of the Targaryen heiress.</p><p>Word was spreading.</p><p><i>And favors expected along with it,</i>  Dany thought with a rueful smile as she studied the looming volcanic  mountains of Dragonmont. They were so high, they seemed lost in the  clouds; not that the thick curtain of smoke was helping matters. It was  no wonder it rained so much around here. It was making the castle\u2019s roof  repairs a slow process, but at least most of the electricity had  returned and there was hot water. Two basic necessities covered.</p><p>From  here, the castle seemed to have been carved from the mountains itself.  Tucked between two towering peaks, it was probably designed that way so  enemies would find it difficult to attack from all sides. Dragonstone  was created to meet possible threats from the sea, and no army was  foolish enough to try traversing the jagged slopes of mountains capable  of erupting at any moment. For a land that was supposedly unstable,  there had been no reports of activity in centuries, and Dragonstone and  its people have survived this long with no major incidents.</p><p><i>May it remain that way for a long time to come\u2026whaaa?</i> </p><p>There was a sudden flash of light to her right, and she turned to  see Missandei beaming at her. She had taken a photo with her cellphone.</p><p>\u201cFor  your Illustrogram page,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cYou looked so good  staring at the mountains like that. You had a regal expression on your  face. Your followers are going to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that even mean?\u201d Dany asked with a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t go about trying to look regal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou  don\u2019t have to,\u201d her friend replied as she placed a kiss on Dany\u2019s lips  before engulfing her in a warm hug. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural queen.\u201d</p><p>Dany blushed and hugged back; while fighting the sting of tears threatening to fall. How she loved and appreciated this woman.</p><p>\u201cA  queen needs her king though, for the nights can get loooonely,\u201d came  the mischievous words which had Dany almost as red as a tomato at  Missandei\u2019s implication. She had done her best not to think about a  certain someone all day, and now\u2026</p><p>\u201cStooop,\u201d Dany whined and pulled away with a pout and roll of her eyes. <i>The gods damn her.</i></p><p>Monterys  was back, though he appeared to be poking at something in the grass  with a stick. She wondered what weird creature he was hunting for now.  Besides, it was time to head back to the castle. His septa \u2013 though glad  for a moment to put her feet up \u2013 would probably be worried sick about  the young master.</p><p>\u201cCome on Monterys,\u201d she called out; glad for the  distraction and an opportunity to avoid speaking about Jon. \u201cLet\u2019s go  home. Almost dinner time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! Are we having chicken nuggets tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dany replied with a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a proper meal, young man. No more of that frozen stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww,\u201d  Monterys protested and stomped his foot; sending more mud flying into  his hair in the process. Daemon, the toad, croaked within the pocket  of his raincoat, and the boy did his best to appease his new pet. \u201cI  wonder if Daemon likes nuggets.\u201d</p><p>Missandei rubbed her chin in mock thought. \u201cI guess we could find out.\u201d</p><p>Dany was shaking her head. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell how about this,\u201d Missandei appeased. \u201cYou eat your veggies and you can have two chicken nuggets\u2026plus one for Daemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,  you can go study up on what frogs like to eat,\u201d Dany added with an arms  folded across her chest. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep a pet like that you  have to learn more about him, right?\u201d</p><p>Monterys nodded. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the library and find books about frogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd  if you can tell me at least two fascinating things about them,\u201d Dany  added with a smile. \u201cYou can have nuggets for breakfast too.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have promised him anything better, for with a yelp of delight, the boy was off and running toward the castle.</p><p>\u201cOne  of these days, he\u2019s going to fall and break his neck and then I\u2019ll have  a civil war on my hands,\u201d Dany said with a groan. \u201cMaybe then I\u2019ll  really have to marry Lord Velaryon to make peace.\u201d</p><p>Missandei  laughed and slipped her arm through Dany\u2019s as they walked back to the  castle together. \u201cHe\u2019s actually easy on the eyes. Only in his early  forties, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d Dany replied with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I forgot. You\u2019re holding out for a certain northerner who keeps getting himself in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Dany shook her head and looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that at all. We\u2019re\u2026friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuuuure,\u201d Missandei replied with a smirk. \u201cSo\u2026when are you going to call your <i>friend</i> again? It\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it? He should be home by now\u2026at least according to Lord Varys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll  call me when he\u2019s ready. Sam still has his private cellphone, remember?  I doubt he\u2019ll want to use his personal phone at this time. Too risky.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F12292536%2Fchapters%2F29288088%23workskin&amp;t=Yzk1NTg0MmQyNzUyNWY0N2EwNmNhZTE1NzdkNTE4ZmI3ZDYwMTNhOSw0MDU1MjZhNTQ5NzQyNzllZTg3MWY2NGRkNDIxOTRmZDkzZWZjM2Qx\">Eye of the Storm - Chapter 17</a></p></p>",

I did stumble across this very poignant image of Emilia, and it reminded me of a chapter of &lsquo;Storm&rsquo; which I am re-posting below. We stan a queen. That is all.)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/203d994d7af086d43e6c3804863c0d98/tumblr_inline_pou9omDxHo1rz3tj7_400.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>He would have turned six today; her Rhaego that is.</p><p>His name  day was usually spent in solemn reflection, where she was content to  remain locked in her room looking through the priceless memories of a  child she had loved and lost. In a small box carved from the oldest  weirwood tree in all of Westeros - according to Magister Illyrio who  presented it to her on her thirteenth name day - Dany had kept a few of  the many gifts given to her unborn son. It was a lovely yet painful  reminder of what could and should have been.</p><p>&nbsp;<i>Her stallion meant to mount the world&hellip; </i></p><p>There was a pair of soft leather booties her handmaiden Doreah  had sewn. His tiny feet would have fit them so well. A belt made of  solid gold medallions &ndash; a gift from Khal Ogo and his <i>khalasar</i> -  would run through her fingers with every tender caress. It would have  been too big for her baby, but he would eventually grow into it. His  first gold ring &ndash;a present from his father &ndash; sat gleaming at the bottom  of the box. Her stallion would have worn it in his hair after his first  name day; the beginning of his reign as the son of the <i>khal</i>.  Last was a finely carved rattle of ivory; or at least it was supposed to  be a rattle though it had an odd shape &ndash; like a miniature <i>arakh</i> but not quite. One of the crones from the <i>dosh khaleen</i> had made it, and it was believed to have powers to keep her son from all harm.</p><p><i>Lies, lies, and more lies,</i> she thought with the sharp tang of bitterness still heavy on her tongue.</p><p>Yet,  hadn&rsquo;t she once clung to those lies with the desperation of a young  girl seeking to find her worth in a world foreign and frightening? She  had sought love wherever she could find it; having received none from  her last living relative and oblivious to the kind Jorah was willing to  give. It was terrible to think being pregnant for a man like Drogo, had  made her feel she was actually more useful than just being a &lsquo;trophy  bride&rsquo;. It made her endless days of drudgery and resigned fear more  palatable.</p><p>Unfortunately, her condition did nothing to decrease  his insatiable sexual appetite, for he wasn&rsquo;t averse to taking her  whenever he felt like it. If anything, seeing her with child made her  even more desirable, he admitted after another night of pumping her full  of his sticky seed until it trickled down her thighs. She told herself  she relished in the gleam of pride in his dark eyes and was pleased when  he praised her for being so strong. Like a true <i>khaleesi</i>.</p><p><i>Moon of my life,</i> he would whisper as he suckled hard on her full and tender breasts until they hurt.</p><p><i>My sun and stars,</i>  she&rsquo;d reply with tears in her eyes as she stared blankly at the ceiling  and tried not to think of her belly throbbing in agony or how heavy and  sweaty he felt against her weary body.</p><p>After all, the blood of the dragon flowed through her, and she could withstand any suffering.</p><p>She  should have guessed something would go terribly wrong when those  throbbing pains became even more pronounced in the latter months of her  pregnancy. Drogo wasn&rsquo;t helping with his constant need to keep moving  from one place to another; to keep track of his assets and influx of  revenue he&rsquo;d argue. It was the Dothraki custom, no matter how many times  the doctor had warned for her not to travel so much.</p><p><i>She can remain in Vaes Dothrak until you return,</i> he would advise. <i>She is already fragile as it is. Traveling such far distances does not help.</i></p><p>Unfortunately for the poor doctor, no one dared argue with the <i>khal</i>  especially when he was dead set on his unborn son being a stallion or  warrior. He was not going to be weak, and his wife had better be on the  next fucking plane to wherever the hell he was going next. Even Jorah,  despite his high esteem in Drogo&rsquo;s eyes, could not convince the <i>khal</i> otherwise.</p><p><i>I am the dragon&rsquo;s daughter,</i> she would tell herself with every agonizing step she tried to mask with a strained smile. <i>The stallion who mounts the world is within me, and he will be as strong as his father.</i></p><p>The  bleeding started somewhere between the flight from Lhazarene to Qohor,  and at first she had slept right through the familiar pangs of pain  until Jhiqui&rsquo;s shriek of terror awakened her. She can still remember  staring dumbly at the lower half of her body; almost marveling at how  thick and heavy the blood was. She was literally drenched in it, and  even as her handmaidens ran around the tiny cabin trying to clean and  stop the damage, Dany had felt the first stirrings of dissociation take a  hold of her.</p><p><i>&nbsp;I failed. </i></p><p>She watched a version of herself still frozen in the bed; her  body simply being pulled this way and that by the sobbing women she also  considered friends. Her face was remarkably without emotion; not a  single tear dripping down her cheek. Her violet gaze was distant and  empty; as barren as the womb that once contained a life.</p><p><i>&nbsp;No longer. No longer. </i></p><p>She could see Drogo dashing inside with his features distraught; a  sight she never thought she&rsquo;d ever see on that handsome proud face.  Dany watched as he hugged her shell, muttering words in Dothraki that  sounded like he was sorry, oh-so-terribly sorry&hellip;as he should be.</p><p><i>You killed him, </i>a tiny voice whispered with icy venom that was frightening. <i>You  and your fucking selfish desires. You killed our baby, and I&rsquo;m glad.  I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s dead, because you don&rsquo;t deserve to be a father.</i></p><p>She might have returned to her body eventually, but everything else after that was a blur. <i>Life</i>  became a blur; a meaningless motion of activities that were of no real  concern to her. Oh she would hear the whispers as she walked by; how the  other women would give looks of pity or disdain. And though her <i>khas</i>  still treated her with respect reserved for her position, there was an  underlying simmer of resentment at her failure to fulfill her most  important of duties. What use was she to anyone? What was her purpose?</p><p>Jorah  &ndash; dear Jorah &ndash; did his best to keep her spirits up. He would read to  her and keep her updated on what was going on in other parts of the  world. Her handmaidens did the same; bringing her fine clothing and  perfumes from the next town or city they stopped at. Drogo, for his  part, became somewhat distant. Losing a son was not exactly considered a  crowning moment for a <i>khal</i> of his stature, and rumors swirled  that he was already looking for a replacement for his barren bride. He  did come to visit her bedroom once in a while, but she could and would  not speak more than a few words to him; polite responses to his almost  robotic queries about her day.</p><p><i>He no longer cares.</i> </p><p>The nights were the worst. It was the time she could finally be  alone to think, and her thoughts were almost always a mixture of  melancholic regrets or vicious vengeance on those responsible for her  nightmares. How many times had she pictured driving an <i>arakh </i> into Drogo&rsquo;s back whenever he came to take her? He didn&rsquo;t seem to mind  that she simply lay like a dead fish as he buried himself to the hilt as  if hoping to impregnate her all over again.</p><p>His seed was strong. It <i>had</i> to be strong, he would grunt with each feverish thrust. He was the goddamn <i>khal</i> of one of the greatest <i>khalasars</i>  ever. His pride had taken a tremendous blow with her failure, and he  would not accept defeat that easily. He would fuck her into the ground  if it meant she produce an heir for him.</p><p>Two more years of this, and she finally had enough.</p><p>He knew. She knew.</p><p>She had absolutely nothing left to give.</p><p>&ldquo;Found it!&rdquo; came the happy sound to rattle her gloomy thoughts.</p><p>Monterys  Velaryon was running back to her with what appeared to be a large black  and red striped toad in his hands. His lilac eyes glowed with victory  and there was a smug smile of satisfaction on his somewhat effeminate  features. Despite the raincoat she had made him wear, his fair hair was  drenched with flecks of mud stuck on it. The rest of him was no better,  and Dany could already picture the fight they were going to have over  him taking a shower later.</p><p><i>&nbsp;Ah boys.  </i></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;nice,&rdquo; she said with a smile as the ugly creature croaked  in protest at being manhandled. The boy had been chasing it along the  marshes for a while, and perhaps it finally got tired and allowed  the human to have its way for now.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m naming him Daemon!&rdquo;  Monterys announced with a flourish. He pet the toad&rsquo;s head tenderly and  grinned at Dany. &ldquo;Can I keep him, Aunt Dany? Pretty please?&rdquo;</p><p>Dany  took a deep breath. The idea of having a toad running around the castle  was not exactly appealing, but since she had agreed to let Lord  Velaryon&rsquo;s son spend the weekend&hellip;how could she say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to that face?  Like Dany, his mother had passed away at childbirth and though Lord  Velaryon did his best to raise him, it was clear his young son craved  the attention of a mother-figure in his life.

Daemon, the toad, croaked within the pocket  of his raincoat, and the boy did his best to appease his new pet. &ldquo;I  wonder if Daemon likes nuggets.&rdquo;</p><p>Missandei rubbed her chin in mock thought. &ldquo;I guess we could find out.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany was shaking her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well how about this,&rdquo; Missandei appeased. &ldquo;You eat your veggies and you can have two chicken nuggets&hellip;plus one for Daemon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or,  you can go study up on what frogs like to eat,&rdquo; Dany added with an arms  folded across her chest. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to keep a pet like that you  have to learn more about him, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Monterys nodded. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what are we going to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go to the library and find books about frogs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And  if you can tell me at least two fascinating things about them,&rdquo; Dany  added with a smile. &ldquo;You can have nuggets for breakfast too.&rdquo;</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t have promised him anything better, for with a yelp of delight, the boy was off and running toward the castle.</p><p>&ldquo;One  of these days, he&rsquo;s going to fall and break his neck and then I&rsquo;ll have  a civil war on my hands,&rdquo; Dany said with a groan. &ldquo;Maybe then I&rsquo;ll  really have to marry Lord Velaryon to make peace.&rdquo;</p><p>Missandei  laughed and slipped her arm through Dany&rsquo;s as they walked back to the  castle together. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually easy on the eyes. Only in his early  forties, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; Dany replied with a chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. I forgot. You&rsquo;re holding out for a certain northerner who keeps getting himself in trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany shook her head and looked away. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that at all. We&rsquo;re&hellip;friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Suuuure,&rdquo; Missandei replied with a smirk. &ldquo;So&hellip;when are you going to call your <i>friend</i> again? It&rsquo;s been a while, hasn&rsquo;t it? He should be home by now&hellip;at least according to Lord Varys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  call me when he&rsquo;s ready. Sam still has his private cellphone, remember?  I doubt he&rsquo;ll want to use his personal phone at this time. Too risky.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F12292536%2Fchapters%2F29288088%23workskin&amp;t=Yzk1NTg0MmQyNzUyNWY0N2EwNmNhZTE1NzdkNTE4ZmI3ZDYwMTNhOSw0MDU1MjZhNTQ5NzQyNzllZTg3MWY2NGRkNDIxOTRmZDkzZWZjM2Qx\">Eye of the Storm - Chapter 17</a></p></p>",
