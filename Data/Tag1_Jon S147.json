Your favourite/least favourite Targaryen: Rhaegar\u00a0 /\u00a0 Maegor</p><p>2. Underrated Targaryen: Queen Naerys (I feel like she&rsquo;s underrated, at least)</p><p>3. Snog/Marry/Avoid Targaryens: Daemon/Rhaegar/Maegor</p><p>4. A Targaryen who deserved better: Rhaella, Naerys</p><p>5. OTP Targaryens: Jaehaerys x Alysanne, Aemon x Naerys, Rhaegar x Lyanna, Jon x Dany, Bloodraven x Shiera.</p><p>6. A Targaryen you&rsquo;d like to go on holiday with: Egg, Maester Aemon or Rhaegar. I can&rsquo;t decide. </p><p>7. A Targaryen you&rsquo;d want to be best friends with: Daenerys </p><p>8. A Targaryen who just needs a hug: sad boy Rhaegar, Jon, Aegon III, Naerys, Rhaella&hellip; </p><p>9. Problematic Fave: Daemon. And Rhaegar, since people consider him problematic.</p><p>10. A Targaryen you&rsquo;d go on a dragon ride with: The only dragon I want to ride is daddy Daemon</p><p>11. Favourite Targaryen bastard? Bloodraven and Shiera.</p><p>12. A Targaryen you&rsquo;d want as a lover: Daemon. And Rhaegar. And Jon. And Aegon I&hellip; It&rsquo;s hard to choose. But Daddy Daemon is top priority. </p><p>13. Which Targaryen dragon is your favourite? Vhagar &amp; Viserion</p><p>14. Bloodraven: fan or ban? Fan </p><p>15. Viserys (son of Aerys II): evil twit or mentally scarred victim? A traumatized man that had bad genes. A bit of both, really. </p><p>16. Favourite non-Targaryen spouse/consort? Bheta! </p><p>17. Team Lilac Eyes or Team Indigo Eyes? Indigo because Rhaegar </p><p>18. Favourite quote by a Targaryen: \u201c Love is the bane of honor, the death of duty. What is honor compared to a woman&rsquo;s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms &hellip; or the memory of a brother&rsquo;s smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.&ldquo; - Maester Aemon</p><p>19.

Land.\u00a0 Because it was created (as a gift from the French king) by Rollo and his group of Vikings who were also known as Northmen.\u00a0 They married French women and with their children created the Normans.</p>\n<p>Jon is of the Northmen only because of his mother and his uncle raising him.\u00a0 There is no Northern association of any kind for the Targs.\u00a0 The Targs don\u2019t even look like what little has been recorded about the Normans.\u00a0 William\u2019s son Henry I was said to have had black hair.\u00a0 The only thing I can really think of that is similar is the Normans were clean shaven and didn\u2019t have beards.\u00a0 But Vikings are famous for them and Normans were descended for them.</p>\n<p>William the Conqueror was also called William the Bastard.\u00a0 And it bothered him.\u00a0 He could act rather impulsive when that got flung at him.</p>\n<p>Jon was also bothered by his bastard status.\u00a0 We all know about that.</p>\n<p>Much is talked about how William the Conqueror conquered England, but he also had to fight for his own home, Normandy.\u00a0 He became the duke at a young age due to his father (who ruled after his elder brother\u2019s death) having died abroad.\u00a0 Needless to say there were other people whose eyes were on Normandy.\u00a0 3 of William\u2019s guardians were killed and there is stories of how William had to be hidden.\u00a0 A rebellion broke out and William had to flee and he took refuge with the French king, Henry I, his future uncle-in-law.\u00a0 The French king then helped William reclaim his home.</p>\n<p>Jon, of course, along with Sansa, had to fight for Winterfell.\u00a0 They had help from the Wildlings and the Mormonts, but they would have lost without the Knights of the Vale.\u00a0 And yeah, Danii is trying to reclaim the Iron Throne, but it\u2019s not the same.\u00a0 Unlike Danii, William was raised in Normandy and was made the duke.\u00a0 The Norman nobles acknowledged the ducal authority and he was always supported and despite wars he was not overthrown with another replacing him as the Duke of Normandy (never officially).\u00a0 Yeah, the Boltons did replace the Starks for a time, but they were never truly accepted by the Northmen.</p>\n<p>William was described as being a fighter and a horseman without equal.\u00a0 He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to and he had great stamina.</p>\n<p>Well, everyone knows Jon\u2019s ability as a fighter.\u00a0 And of course being a great horseman makes one think of his mother, Lyanna.</p>\n<p>And now I come to one of the reasons William the Conqueror is one of my fave historical figures.\u00a0 He LOVED his wife Maud(or Matilda) of Flanders and she loved him (they were also cousins).\u00a0 They had a successful and affectionate marriage with 9 or 10 children.\u00a0 William was faithful to her and didn\u2019t have any bastards.\u00a0 There\u2019s a legend (probably not true) that when William proposed marriage to her via a messenger (naturally it started as a political alliance) Maud was said to have refused by saying she was too highborn to marry a bastard.\u00a0 Insulted, William rode over (the destination depends on the version and one is her own home) and threw her to the ground by her braids and then rode off.\u00a0 Maud\u2019s father, was of course outraged and for the insult he was going to war against William.\u00a0 But before swords could be drawn Maud stopped it by refusing to marry anyone, but William.</p>\n<p>Of course us Jonsas believe that Jon and Sansa will have a loving marriage that is also a political alliance.\u00a0 A lot of us believe that when the North finds out Jon is a Targ they won\u2019t be happy and will probably want Jon\u2019s head.\u00a0 And we believe the matter will be settled by Jon and Sansa\u2019s marriage.\u00a0 How that will go down is what we\u2019re guessing at.\u00a0 So bloodshed (mainly Jon\u2019s) could be avoided by Sansa marrying Jon.</p>\n<p>Henry I of France was not happy with William marrying his niece, his sister\u2019s daughter. Maud was the daughter of the Count of Flanders one of the most powerful noblemen in France.\u00a0 She was also descended from Charlemagne and Wessex royalty (that helped William in England).\u00a0 Henry viewed that as a threat and then supported the barons against William, his nephew-in-law.\u00a0 He invaded Normandy twice which failed both times.\u00a0 It only ended with Henry I\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>A lot of us Jonsas believe Danii will not be happy with Jon\u2019s true parentage.\u00a0 She will see him as a threat and then move to eliminate him.\u00a0 So the once allies, will then be enemies.\u00a0 And it\u2019ll probably end with Danii\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>Rollo, the one who founded Normandy, ruled with strict laws and hanged murderers and thieves making Normandy one of the safest places in Europe.\u00a0 Also he was a Viking and they valued courage, truth, honor, fidelity, discipline, hospitality, industriousness, self-reliance, and perseverance and family was important to them.\u00a0 And there\u2019s all kinds of legends that are not true about them (i.e. the horned helmets).</p>\n<p>It reminds me of the North and their code of justice and honor and their values.\u00a0 The Stark children were sheltered and didn\u2019t face all the danger and intrigue that happened constantly in the south.\u00a0 Of course that changed thanks to Theon\u2019s betrayal with the Ironborn and the Boltons, but they are unpopular.\u00a0 Also the North, which was really seen with Robb, got all kinds of exaggerated legends about them like the Vikings did.</p>\n<p>And mentioning Rollo\u2026\u00a0 His Scandinavian name was Hrolfr which literally means \u201cfame and glory for the wolf\u201d.\u00a0 And William means \u201cdetermined protector\u201d.</p>\n<p>The only Targ that has any connection to wolves is of course, Jon Snow.\u00a0 And Jon is of course determined to protect the realm of men.\u00a0 It was all in the Night Watch\u2019s oath.\u00a0 Also the Normans introduced chivalry (so I assume making oaths as well) to England.</p>\n<p>That got longer than I thought. XD\u00a0 Well, of course William the Conqueror and Jon Snow aren\u2019t exactly alike (as no character in GoT is exactly like any one historical figure), but there are a lot of similarities, I believe.<br/></p><p><b>Submitted by Rose</b></p>",

he was going to war against William.\u00a0 But before swords could be drawn Maud stopped it by refusing to marry anyone, but William.</p>\n<p>Of course us Jonsas believe that Jon and Sansa will have a loving marriage that is also a political alliance.\u00a0 A lot of us believe that when the North finds out Jon is a Targ they won\u2019t be happy and will probably want Jon\u2019s head.\u00a0 And we believe the matter will be settled by Jon and Sansa\u2019s marriage.\u00a0 How that will go down is what we\u2019re guessing at.\u00a0 So bloodshed (mainly Jon\u2019s) could be avoided by Sansa marrying Jon.</p>\n<p>Henry I of France was not happy with William marrying his niece, his sister\u2019s daughter. Maud was the daughter of the Count of Flanders one of the most powerful noblemen in France.\u00a0 She was also descended from Charlemagne and Wessex royalty (that helped William in England).\u00a0 Henry viewed that as a threat and then supported the barons against William, his nephew-in-law.\u00a0 He invaded Normandy twice which failed both times.\u00a0 It only ended with Henry I\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>A lot of us Jonsas believe Danii will not be happy with Jon\u2019s true parentage.\u00a0 She will see him as a threat and then move to eliminate him.\u00a0 So the once allies, will then be enemies.\u00a0 And it\u2019ll probably end with Danii\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>Rollo, the one who founded Normandy, ruled with strict laws and hanged murderers and thieves making Normandy one of the safest places in Europe.\u00a0 Also he was a Viking and they valued courage, truth, honor, fidelity, discipline, hospitality, industriousness, self-reliance, and perseverance and family was important to them.\u00a0 And there\u2019s all kinds of legends that are not true about them (i.e. the horned helmets).</p>\n<p>It reminds me of the North and their code of justice and honor and their values.\u00a0 The Stark children were sheltered and didn\u2019t face all the danger and intrigue that happened constantly in the south.\u00a0 Of course that changed thanks to Theon\u2019s betrayal with the Ironborn and the Boltons, but they are unpopular.\u00a0 Also the North, which was really seen with Robb, got all kinds of exaggerated legends about them like the Vikings did.</p>\n<p>And mentioning Rollo\u2026\u00a0 His Scandinavian name was Hrolfr which literally means \u201cfame and glory for the wolf\u201d.\u00a0 And William means \u201cdetermined protector\u201d.</p>\n<p>The only Targ that has any connection to wolves is of course, Jon Snow.\u00a0 And Jon is of course determined to protect the realm of men.\u00a0 It was all in the Night Watch\u2019s oath.\u00a0 Also the Normans introduced chivalry (so I assume making oaths as well) to England.</p>\n<p>That got longer than I thought. XD\u00a0 Well, of course William the Conqueror and Jon Snow aren\u2019t exactly alike (as no character in GoT is exactly like any one historical figure), but there are a lot of similarities, I believe.<br></p><p><b>Submitted by Rose</b></p>",

He\u2019d be taken with your adventurous nature and often use that to his advantage in every day life. Grayson would take you hiking, showing you his favorite sights and create a romantic atmosphere by doing it either at sunrise or sundown.

He joined a support group where people wrote music or played music as they spoke about their struggles and that\u2019s how you met. You became the goofy, always supportive person he missed in his life, one so loyal he didn\u2019t have to worry about you leaving him for another. Though he still has trouble accepting his past, he found it easier to share it with you and it helped heal his mind.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"276\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"hellomadelene:TvKr9tPchQEo3877WmDp7g:ZyOFcf2KdPhcx\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e72026fb931afca2bf00699ea627c3d8/tumblr_ooezqwQWxE1vii01fo1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"276\"/></figure><p><b>I\u2019d ship you with Lydia Martin.</b></p><p>She suffered a lot of loss in the past which made her weary about letting people in her life.

You were the only one to make him laugh at times like that and he became grateful to have you on his side. It took some time, but your friendship blossomed into a solid relationship, one he thought was impossible to find.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"churchofmiles:U-_J2awzjsTOe0Ymvnoq1Q:ZcCkEl1nalIDz\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/090e7de98ef77565cd1ac0f4c6697875/tumblr_nq7oig7fdY1uoyxjzo2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"225\"/></figure>",

        "question": "Hi, pardon me if you've ever been asked something like this, but (in your opinion) if Ashara had lived, would people still see her as being Jon Snow's mother? And if they did, do you think she herself would say otherwise? I know we know next to nothing about her, but I do believe it highly likely she is the reason Ned found the tower.",
        "answer": "<p>There are theories that Ashara faked her death, and while I\u2019m not a big fan of any (mostly regarding the mysterious ladies she\u2019s theorized to be disguised as), it\u2019s still an open possibility, so we should really amend this question to \u201cif Ashara had lived / was publicly known to be alive.\u201d Anyway, would people still think she could be Jon Snow\u2019s mother?
