        "caption": "<h2>Day Four</h2><p><b>Gendry tells Arya about the holidays in Flea Bottom.</b></p><!-- more --><p>The pair was crowded around a fire lit in Arya\u2019s chambers. Gendry couldn\u2019t help but imagine the words many of the men would whisper if they were caught. He could imagine the Hound would say something crude, but worst of all he could imagine Jon wanting to whip him through the streets in Wintertown if he discovered that Gendry was spending time with Arya in her bedchamber after dark. Oh Gods, when you put it that way it sounded even more boorish than it was.</p><p>Right now the two of them were huddled together, shoulder to shoulder, searching for warmth from each others bodies. The Others had been defeated, but the seemingly never-ending freezing temperatures got worse than before. The Citadel claimed it to be one of the worst winters in the history of Westeros. The deathly cold was not the only thing left to worry about since the Great War ended. To no-one\u2019s surprise Cersei Lannister still posed a threat to the south. Jaime Lannister had told them about his sister\u2019s plan when he finally made it north. He mentioned that he could not compromise his honour for his sister\u2019s plotting. Tyrion had been overjoyed to see his brother come to his senses after all these years. No one was surprised to hear of Yuron Greyjoy sailing to retrieve the Iron Fleet from Bravos, Daenerys mentioned something about him needing to work on his lying. Gendry hated to admit it, but to him going south didn\u2019t seem like such an awful idea. Yes the war against Cersei would be dangerous, but the warmer weather of the south seemed like a relief compared to the bone-chilling weather of the north. He never thought he would say it, but Gendry was starting to miss his home in Flea Bottom. He knew he was crazy for thinking that way, since the Starks had given him so much more in a short period of time than he had ever gotten while living in Flea Bottom, but he wondered how his old shop was doing, if someone had bought it, or if one of the other men took over after he left. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Arya asked, lifting her head off of Gendry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou have that stupid look on your face.\u201d</p><p>Gendry rolled his eyes. \u201cI was thinking about Flea Bottom.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never talked about it much, why now?\u201d Arya looked at him skeptically, that analyzing look crossing her hardened features. </p><p>\u201cI guess I miss it. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was where I spent my childhood. I have so many memories there, and the holiday celebrations are approaching. The festivities there are just so much different than how you northerners celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never spent the holidays there. Joffrey\u2019s little show cut my family\u2019s stay short. The only one that got to spend any sort of holiday down there was Sansa and even she didn\u2019t really get to celebrate anything.\u201d Arya started, \u201cI\u2019d listen if you wanted to talk about it though. Maybe you can add a different perspective on Kings Landing, one I have never been able to see because of the trauma my family suffered there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want to bring back any memories.\u201d Arya nodded her head and rested it back on his shoulder. Her arm came up to wrap around his bicep as she snuggled closer to the heat his body was radiating. \u201cOur festivities always start at the same time as the Festival of the Mother. They are a whole week affair. It\u2019s so big because it\u2019s usually the only time of year we get food from the royal family. Of course, it isn\u2019t much food, but it\u2019s still more than we get the rest of the year. Usually it\u2019s leftover meat and bread, but sometimes we got fruit and vegetables as well. It was a time when we could be thankful for what we had. To be thankful we weren\u2019t going to starve that year.</p><p>\u201cSince no one had any money, we would make things for our family members or those we loved out of stones and sticks. Nothing extravagant, but it would be meaningful. It was the thought and effort that mattered when you had to extra coin to spend. I never had any family to celebrate with, so I would spend the week with Tobho Mott and his daughters. His wife had died in the birthing bed after delivering their second daughter. I was positive that if he hadn\u2019t of sent me to the wall I would have married his eldest daughter. She was the same age as me, maybe a year my senior, but she was pretty. She wanted to work for Lord Baelish and make more money for her family, but he would never let any of his children work in a whorehouse. Instead, they worked at the bakery. I think one of them actually knew Hot Pie. I never wanted to marry one of his daughters, but I thought I owed him for mentoring me in the smithy. I would have done it had he asked. He was truly the only family I had.\u201d Gendry lowered his head into his hands, it had pained him so when on his return to Kings Landing he heard of what came of Tobho Mott. His old mentor slain. </p><p>\u201cDo you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you had known your father was King Robert?\u201d Arya was looking at him with curiosity now. Her grey eyes boring into his own with pure astonishment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it before. Wondered if my life would have been like Jon\u2019s, treated as better than a piece of shite that littered the streets of Flea Bottom. But when I think about it, I don\u2019t think Cersei would ever let me be seen at court. I would always be a disgrace to her name. Lord Tywin certainly would never have allowed it, and I don\u2019t know if my father would ever want to fight to have me around. I certainly wasn\u2019t his only bastard. I heard he had hundreds scattered around Westeros. Now look at us. I\u2019m the only Baratheon alive, and I\u2019m only half. Jon mentioned legitimizing me after all of the snow settled and Cersei was dealt with. He knows I pose no threat to the throne, he know I don\u2019t want it. Queen Daenerys has second thoughts on the matter, but deep down she knows that I don\u2019t desire it either. I don\u2019t feel like I truly deserve the title Baratheon. I never knew my father, and I only ever met my Uncle Stannis once. All he wanted was to use me for my King\u2019s blood. I don\u2019t feel like a Baratheon. But since house Baratheon stemmed from House Targaryen they don\u2019t want to see it wiped from existence. So here I am there last resort. Getting offered something every bastard dreams of, and I don\u2019t even really want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do deserve it. You helped fight for the Seven Kingdoms just as much as Jon or Daenerys or any of us for that matter. Just because you never met your father doesn\u2019t make you any less of his son. Jon never met his mother, but he loves her just the same. My mother and I never saw eye-to-eye but I still love and miss her everyday. Bran is the three-eyed raven now and doesn\u2019t act a smidge of his old self, but he is still a Stark. You\u2019re just as much a Baratheon as Jon is a Stark. Never doubt your worth or how deserving you are.\u201d Arya was standing in front of him now. Both of her hands rested on his shoulders. He was sitting down but she met his eye-level evenly. He looked up at her, his bright blue eyes sparkling as the light of the fire danced across them. Arya\u2019s hand moved to the back of Gendry\u2019s head and moved it to rest against the flat of her stomach. She rubbed small circles on the back of his scalp with her fingers. He brought both of his hands to rest on her hips, he pulled her closer. Breathing in the scent of her. He was overwhelmed by the smell of forest and snow. As he pulled away from her, Gendry left his hands resting on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWords can\u2019t tell you how happy I am that you\u2019re alive. There wasn\u2019t a day that went by that I didn\u2019t think of you.\u201d He whispered, just loud enough for her to hear.

Gendry couldn\u2019t help but imagine the words many of the men would whisper if they were caught. He could imagine the Hound would say something crude, but worst of all he could imagine Jon wanting to whip him through the streets in Wintertown if he discovered that Gendry was spending time with Arya in her bedchamber after dark. Oh Gods, when you put it that way it sounded even more boorish than it was.</p><p>Right now the two of them were huddled together, shoulder to shoulder, searching for warmth from each others bodies. The Others had been defeated, but the seemingly never-ending freezing temperatures got worse than before. The Citadel claimed it to be one of the worst winters in the history of Westeros. The deathly cold was not the only thing left to worry about since the Great War ended. To no-one\u2019s surprise Cersei Lannister still posed a threat to the south. Jaime Lannister had told them about his sister\u2019s plan when he finally made it north. He mentioned that he could not compromise his honour for his sister\u2019s plotting. Tyrion had been overjoyed to see his brother come to his senses after all these years. No one was surprised to hear of Yuron Greyjoy sailing to retrieve the Iron Fleet from Bravos, Daenerys mentioned something about him needing to work on his lying. Gendry hated to admit it, but to him going south didn\u2019t seem like such an awful idea. Yes the war against Cersei would be dangerous, but the warmer weather of the south seemed like a relief compared to the bone-chilling weather of the north. He never thought he would say it, but Gendry was starting to miss his home in Flea Bottom. He knew he was crazy for thinking that way, since the Starks had given him so much more in a short period of time than he had ever gotten while living in Flea Bottom, but he wondered how his old shop was doing, if someone had bought it, or if one of the other men took over after he left. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Arya asked, lifting her head off of Gendry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou have that stupid look on your face.\u201d</p><p>Gendry rolled his eyes. \u201cI was thinking about Flea Bottom.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never talked about it much, why now?\u201d Arya looked at him skeptically, that analyzing look crossing her hardened features. </p><p>\u201cI guess I miss it. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was where I spent my childhood. I have so many memories there, and the holiday celebrations are approaching. The festivities there are just so much different than how you northerners celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never spent the holidays there. Joffrey\u2019s little show cut my family\u2019s stay short. The only one that got to spend any sort of holiday down there was Sansa and even she didn\u2019t really get to celebrate anything.\u201d Arya started, \u201cI\u2019d listen if you wanted to talk about it though. Maybe you can add a different perspective on Kings Landing, one I have never been able to see because of the trauma my family suffered there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want to bring back any memories.\u201d Arya nodded her head and rested it back on his shoulder. Her arm came up to wrap around his bicep as she snuggled closer to the heat his body was radiating. \u201cOur festivities always start at the same time as the Festival of the Mother. They are a whole week affair. It\u2019s so big because it\u2019s usually the only time of year we get food from the royal family. Of course, it isn\u2019t much food, but it\u2019s still more than we get the rest of the year. Usually it\u2019s leftover meat and bread, but sometimes we got fruit and vegetables as well. It was a time when we could be thankful for what we had. To be thankful we weren\u2019t going to starve that year.</p><p>\u201cSince no one had any money, we would make things for our family members or those we loved out of stones and sticks. Nothing extravagant, but it would be meaningful. It was the thought and effort that mattered when you had to extra coin to spend. I never had any family to celebrate with, so I would spend the week with Tobho Mott and his daughters. His wife had died in the birthing bed after delivering their second daughter. I was positive that if he hadn\u2019t of sent me to the wall I would have married his eldest daughter. She was the same age as me, maybe a year my senior, but she was pretty. She wanted to work for Lord Baelish and make more money for her family, but he would never let any of his children work in a whorehouse. Instead, they worked at the bakery. I think one of them actually knew Hot Pie. I never wanted to marry one of his daughters, but I thought I owed him for mentoring me in the smithy. I would have done it had he asked. He was truly the only family I had.\u201d Gendry lowered his head into his hands, it had pained him so when on his return to Kings Landing he heard of what came of Tobho Mott. His old mentor slain. </p><p>\u201cDo you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you had known your father was King Robert?\u201d Arya was looking at him with curiosity now. Her grey eyes boring into his own with pure astonishment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it before. Wondered if my life would have been like Jon\u2019s, treated as better than a piece of shite that littered the streets of Flea Bottom. But when I think about it, I don\u2019t think Cersei would ever let me be seen at court. I would always be a disgrace to her name. Lord Tywin certainly would never have allowed it, and I don\u2019t know if my father would ever want to fight to have me around. I certainly wasn\u2019t his only bastard. I heard he had hundreds scattered around Westeros. Now look at us. I\u2019m the only Baratheon alive, and I\u2019m only half. Jon mentioned legitimizing me after all of the snow settled and Cersei was dealt with. He knows I pose no threat to the throne, he know I don\u2019t want it. Queen Daenerys has second thoughts on the matter, but deep down she knows that I don\u2019t desire it either. I don\u2019t feel like I truly deserve the title Baratheon. I never knew my father, and I only ever met my Uncle Stannis once. All he wanted was to use me for my King\u2019s blood. I don\u2019t feel like a Baratheon. But since house Baratheon stemmed from House Targaryen they don\u2019t want to see it wiped from existence. So here I am there last resort. Getting offered something every bastard dreams of, and I don\u2019t even really want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do deserve it. You helped fight for the Seven Kingdoms just as much as Jon or Daenerys or any of us for that matter. Just because you never met your father doesn\u2019t make you any less of his son. Jon never met his mother, but he loves her just the same. My mother and I never saw eye-to-eye but I still love and miss her everyday. Bran is the three-eyed raven now and doesn\u2019t act a smidge of his old self, but he is still a Stark. You\u2019re just as much a Baratheon as Jon is a Stark. Never doubt your worth or how deserving you are.\u201d Arya was standing in front of him now. Both of her hands rested on his shoulders. He was sitting down but she met his eye-level evenly. He looked up at her, his bright blue eyes sparkling as the light of the fire danced across them. Arya\u2019s hand moved to the back of Gendry\u2019s head and moved it to rest against the flat of her stomach. She rubbed small circles on the back of his scalp with her fingers. He brought both of his hands to rest on her hips, he pulled her closer. Breathing in the scent of her. He was overwhelmed by the smell of forest and snow. As he pulled away from her, Gendry left his hands resting on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWords can\u2019t tell you how happy I am that you\u2019re alive. There wasn\u2019t a day that went by that I didn\u2019t think of you.\u201d He whispered, just loud enough for her to hear. A small and appreciative smile pulled on the corner of her lips. </p><p>\u201cI missed you too Gendry.\u201d Arya muttered, pressing her lips to the top of his head. Gendry wished they could stay in this moment forever, but he knew he would have to leave soon; they were already at risk of getting caught.

Wondered if my life would have been like Jon&rsquo;s, treated as better than a piece of shite that littered the streets of Flea Bottom. But when I think about it, I don&rsquo;t think Cersei would ever let me be seen at court. I would always be a disgrace to her name. Lord Tywin certainly would never have allowed it, and I don&rsquo;t know if my father would ever want to fight to have me around. I certainly wasn&rsquo;t his only bastard. I heard he had hundreds scattered around Westeros. Now look at us. I&rsquo;m the only Baratheon alive, and I&rsquo;m only half. Jon mentioned legitimizing me after all of the snow settled and Cersei was dealt with. He knows I pose no threat to the throne, he know I don&rsquo;t want it. Queen Daenerys has second thoughts on the matter, but deep down she knows that I don&rsquo;t desire it either. I don&rsquo;t feel like I truly deserve the title Baratheon. I never knew my father, and I only ever met my Uncle Stannis once. All he wanted was to use me for my King&rsquo;s blood. I don&rsquo;t feel like a Baratheon. But since house Baratheon stemmed from House Targaryen they don&rsquo;t want to see it wiped from existence. So here I am there last resort. Getting offered something every bastard dreams of, and I don&rsquo;t even really want it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do deserve it. You helped fight for the Seven Kingdoms just as much as Jon or Daenerys or any of us for that matter. Just because you never met your father doesn&rsquo;t make you any less of his son. Jon never met his mother, but he loves her just the same. My mother and I never saw eye-to-eye but I still love and miss her everyday. Bran is the three-eyed raven now and doesn&rsquo;t act a smidge of his old self, but he is still a Stark. You&rsquo;re just as much a Baratheon as Jon is a Stark. Never doubt your worth or how deserving you are.&rdquo; Arya was standing in front of him now. Both of her hands rested on his shoulders. He was sitting down but she met his eye-level evenly. He looked up at her, his bright blue eyes sparkling as the light of the fire danced across them. Arya&rsquo;s hand moved to the back of Gendry&rsquo;s head and moved it to rest against the flat of her stomach. She rubbed small circles on the back of his scalp with her fingers. He brought both of his hands to rest on her hips, he pulled her closer. Breathing in the scent of her. He was overwhelmed by the smell of forest and snow. As he pulled away from her, Gendry left his hands resting on her hips.</p><p>&ldquo;Words can&rsquo;t tell you how happy I am that you&rsquo;re alive. There wasn&rsquo;t a day that went by that I didn&rsquo;t think of you.&rdquo; He whispered, just loud enough for her to hear. A small and appreciative smile pulled on the corner of her lips. </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too Gendry.&rdquo; Arya muttered, pressing her lips to the top of his head. Gendry wished they could stay in this moment forever, but he knew he would have to leave soon; they were already at risk of getting caught. He stood slowly and looked down at the woman he shared some of the hardest moments of his life with and squeezed her hips slightly before pulling her into his arms tightly. &ldquo;Maybe after all of this settles down we can spend the holidays together and celebrate like you used too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really like that Arry. I really would.&rdquo; Gendry bent down and pressed a small kiss to her forehead before moving to make his way to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning, sleep well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight Gendry.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Goodnight Arya.&rdquo;</p></p>",
