                "content": "<p>Jon and Bran have such a sweet, underrated relationship, one that gets overlooked a lot in light of other ones but that I think is vitally important all the same. Jon&rsquo;s goodbye to an unconscious Bran before he leaves for the Wall, as well as their currently close geographical proximity to one another, suggest to me that their reunion will be significant, beyond &ldquo;my brother who I thought was dead is really alive.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot in the text that makes me think that Jon and Bran hold importance to one another in terms of characters (naturally: they&rsquo;re siblings, they each admire things about the other, they both miss one another, etc), but also a great deal that hints at their importance to each other in terms of plot. Of all the Starklings, Jon and Bran are the only two directly involved in the conflict with the White Walkers. Not to mention that, post-resurrection, Jon will also be far more familiar with warging.&nbsp;</p><p>GRRM makes sure to drop symbols and hints (sometimes not even subtle ones) in Jon&rsquo;s chapters about his brother. Bran has tried to talk to him through dreams, trees, and possibly even birds:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\">He rose and dressed in darkness, as Mormont&rsquo;s raven muttered across the room. &ldquo;<i>Corn</i>,&rdquo; the bird said, and, &ldquo;<i>King</i>,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;<i>Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow</i>.&rdquo; That was queer.
