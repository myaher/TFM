He looked down checking and then looked back up at you with a shocked look on his face. It only took you a second to register what that look meant. You collapsed back on the bed, your hand on your forehead.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, Y/N relax\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax! Chris how can I relax? This is serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, babe, it probably means nothing, just one slip up.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>You sat up and stared at him hard. He was acting so nonchalant but you knew that this could be something serious and it was starting to annoy you.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you finally said. \u201cThe condom broke. All it takes is one slip up you know that. This isn\u2019t something to act as if it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>He sighed then scooted up to sit against the headboard next to you.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what happens now? What do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I have to take a test, but I can\u2019t now because it\u2019s too early.\u201d You put your head in your hands. \u201cSo, we wait.\u201d</p><p>Chris was silent for a moment, thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat- what if you are, that could be a good thing, right?\u201d</p><p>You lifted your head to look at him. A good thing?</p><p>\u201cChris, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, that it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing if you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He asked, genuinely confused.</p><p>You shook your head, not wanting to confess your fears right then. \u201cLet\u2019s just wait for the test, all right?\u201d</p><p>You swung your feet off the bed and walked into the bathroom, closing the door behind you and turning on the shower. You didn\u2019t get in right away, but sat on the edge of the tub to think.\u00a0</p><p>If I am, what am I gonna do? I\u2019m not ready for this. I have too much I want to do first. You shook your head again. Now was not the time to get worried. You haven\u2019t even taken the test yet, there was a chance you couldn\u2019t be. You had to hold on to that hope. You heaved yourself off the toilet and stepped into the shower, trying to not worry anymore.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>You had waited three weeks. Yeah, you had missed your period, but then again it could be late. You were stressed out after all and you knew that affected it.\u00a0</p><p>You paced up and down the bedroom, looking at your phone every few seconds to see if you had waited enough time. You sighed and went into the bathroom, where you left the test sitting on the counter - you hadn\u2019t been able to be in the same room as it - and looked down at the little stick on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>There it was, as clear as day, \u201cpregnant\u201d it read.\u00a0 You picked it up and shook it, half out of frustration and anger, half as if it would change the result, but there the word was still in the little window, staring at you.You threw it down and sat on the side of the tub in shock.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s where Chris found you an hour later.</p><p>\u201cBabe, where are you?\u201d you heard his voice call from the living room. You didn\u2019t respond. \u201cBabe?\u201d His voice came closer, he was in the bedroom now.</p><p>You didn\u2019t look up when he popped his head in the bathroom. \u201cThere you are! What are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>You just shook your head, unable to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked looking concerned.</p><p>You opened your mouth to answer, but no words came out. Your mouth felt dry. You cleared your throat and tried again.</p><p>\u201cIt- it\u2019s positive.\u201d The words came out in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cPositive? What\u2019s positive?\u201d He looked around and spotted the test on the ground next to your foot.</p><p>You watched his face as understanding dawned upon it, followed by a big smile. You\u00a0 glared at him but he didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, this is fantastic! I\u2019m gonna be a dad! Oh man, I gotta call mom!\u201d He rummaged in his pocket for his phone.</p><p>\u201cChris, Chris stop,\u201d you said as you grabbed his hand, stopping him from dialing. \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath to calm yourself. \u201cI- I don\u2019t know if I want to have this baby right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, I don\u2019t want to be a mom right now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? So, what are you gonna do? You\u2019re not talkin about getting rid of it?\u201d</p><p>You looked into his eyes that were full of distress and shook your head. You stood up and walked into the bedroom and began pacing again for a minute before speaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2026 exactly. I\u2019m just not ready for this. I feel like I\u2019m too young and\u2026\u201d</p><p>But he cut you off. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not getting any younger here, Y/N! This is a good thing, don\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good thing for who? For you? I\u2019m not ready to go through all that. I\u2019m not ready to be a mother. I have too much I still want to do. What about my job, what about traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can still do that!\u201d He argued. \u201cYou can still do all of that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow!?\u201d You practically shouted, then quieter you asked, \u201cHow can I do all that with a baby on my hip and taking up all my time and money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act as if you\u2019re gonna be alone. I\u2019ll be helping you.\u201d</p><p>You snorted. \u201cChris, you\u2019re gone half the year filming and doing press tours, how often will you be here to \u2018help\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ll just cut back on some of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you will,\u201d you said with a roll of your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d He insisted as you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you said pleadingly, wanting to make him understand. \u201cI cannot do this right now. This, this is one of my biggest fears and now that it\u2019s happened, I can\u2019t see a way to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, this isn\u2019t something to be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? You don\u2019t understand! To me, this is a bigger interruption of my life than it is for you. And\u2026\u201d you paused not wanting to voice your biggest fear of them all.</p><p>\u201cAnd what, Y/N?\u201d He grabbed your hands, but you wouldn\u2019t look at him, keeping your eyes focused on the wall behind him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 what if one day\u2026 you decide you-you\u2019ve had enough,\u201d you stammered out, still not meeting his eyes. \u201cWhat if one day you decide to just leave?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long while before speaking,\u201cHow- how could you say that?\u201d\u00a0 The heartbreak in his voice nearly brought you to tears. \u201cI would never do that! I would never abandon you or our child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now,\u201d you said, your voice thick with unshed tears, shaking your hands from him grip. \u201cBut who\u2019s to say what will happen? If it takes too much of your time or your energy, what\u2019s keeping you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove!\u201d He insisted vehemently. \u201cLove is what\u2019s gonna keep me around. Love for you and love for our child.\u201d</p><p>You kept shaking your head, the tears finally falling. \u201cI can\u2019t Chris, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d And before he could stop you, you stormed out of the room.</p><p>Chris was hot on your heels however. You had grabbed your purse and keys and had your hand on the door knob ready to leave, where you had no idea. He grabbed your arm, stopping you before you walked out.</p><p>\u201cY/N, please, let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already have, Chris. I just\u2026 I need to leave for a while.\u201d You loosened his grip on your arm and opened the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>You got in your car and started it, looking back at your house, you saw Chris standing there with a sad look on his face, you didn\u2019t see the tears though. You turned a way and backed out of the driveway and drove off.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah mom I know I can\u2019t force her,\u201d Chris was saying into his phone hours later. You still hadn\u2019t turned up and he had called his mom to ask for advice. When he had told her that you were pregnant, she had been excited. Then he told her about the conversation between you two, and she settled down to help her son through his feelings.</p><p>\u201cGive her some time, you have to realize what a shock this is for her,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He sighed into the phone. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What else happened?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help but let out a soft chuckle, even over the phone, she knew something was wrong with him.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he began. \u201cShe said she was worried that one day I\u2019d get tired of all of it and just up and leave. I think it\u2019s her biggest fear, being left alone to take care of a baby by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d she said softly, then more sternly, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t do that though. I raised you far better than that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did!\u201d He told her defensively. \u201cI would never do that! You know how long I&rsquo;ve wanted to be a dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I know, I just had to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do and I can\u2019t tell you what will happen, just give her time. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll all be okay, whatever happens, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>They talked for a little while longer before hanging up. Unsure of what to do, Chris began pacing around the house, trying to find something to occupy himself with. He tried watching tv and reading and cleaning, nothing helped. He finally decided to go find you. He wouldn\u2019t pressure you, like his mother had cautioned against, but he wanted to prove to you that he\u2019d be there for you. He collected his key and headed out to his car; thinking hard about where you might have gone.</p><p>Meanwhile you had drove around for a while, no particular destination in mind. When you finally became tired of just driving around aimlessly, you drove over to the park only a few miles from your house. Getting out, you walked along one of the paths until you found a bench to sit on. You sat back and watched the people enjoying their weekend. It amazed you that there were people who were going on with their lives without this problem looming over them.</p><p>You were lost in thought when you heard a shout. You shook yourself out of it just in time to see a bright blue and green ball bouncing towards you with a little girl toddling after it, her pigtails bouncing. You caught it easily.</p><p>\u201cMy ball!\u201d The girl said to you.</p><p>Her mom ran up behind her. \u201cMia, that\u2019s not nice. Ask the lady for it back.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked up at you, her bright eyes shining in the sun. \u201cMay I pwease have my ball back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, sweetheart,\u201d you said handing it back to her.</p><p>\u201cTank you!\u201d she said with a smile, then she asked you, \u201cToss ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah sure,\u201d you said looking at her mother to see if it was okay. She nodded with a smile and you stood up.\u00a0</p><p>Little Mia tossed the ball with all her might, sending it flying about two feet. You laughed and rolled it back to her, but she missed and toddled off after it. Next, she tossed it to her mom. You three played this game for a while, you talking to her mom while you both watched the little girl chase after the ball, until Mia stopped and pointed.</p><p>\u201cWho that?\u201d</p><p>You and her mom looked around to where she was pointing and there stood Chris. He was watching you with a small smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend,\u201d you told the little girl and her mom, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>You walked toward Chris.</p><p>\u201cSo you found me,\u201d you said to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so I did. Look Y/N, I don\u2019t wanna pressure you into anything\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m just in shock about all this.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI get that, maybe we could talk\u2026\u201d he stopped and smiled again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded behind you and you turned and saw little Mia standing behind you, clutching her ball against her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Y/N, come back and play.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and bent down to talk to her. \u201cOkay, but only if my friend plays too.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked Chris up and down, considering him for a minute, then nodded. She then stepped back and threw the ball to him. He laughed and caught it.</p><p>\u201cOh, that was a good one! You could play for the Patriots with an arm like that.\u201d</p><p>Mia giggled at his praise and watched as he tossed the ball to you, you caught it, then rolled it to Mia.\u00a0</p><p>Your game went on for another twenty minutes or so, before her mom called to her that it was time to leave.</p><p>\u201cIt was so nice meeting you both,\u201d you said shaking her mom\u2019s hand while Mia hugged Chris.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you too,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on Mia, let\u2019s go, honey.\u201d</p><p>Before she walked off she ran and hugged you tight. You lifted her up and looked in her eyes. You both smiled at each other, and you felt yourself relax for the first time in weeks. Mia then reached her arms around your neck and hugged you again.</p><p>\u201cBye, bye Miss Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You hugged her back. \u201cBye, bye Mia.\u201d</p><p>You put her down and she ran over to her mom. You watched them walk away, your hand resting on your stomach. You then turned to Chris.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go talk,\u201d you said softly.</p><p>He nodded and took your hand and steered you onto a path. You two walked hand in hand in deep conversation around the park three times until it had gotten dark.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You exhaled and stretched your back, trying to alleviate some of the discomfort you felt. You readjusted the gown you had on, then swung your legs. You felt Chris reach out and stop one of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fidgeting, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m nervous.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019ve been here about five times already, you\u2019d think you\u2019d be used to this by now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your reply was cut off by the door opening. In walked your doctor, a cheery middle aged lady with short cropped hair.</p><p>\u201cAll right now, Miss Y/N, how are we doing this month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Chris cleared his throat loudly causing you to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay well I\u2019ve been having really bad heartburn,\u201d you confessed.\u00a0</p><p>Your doctor nodded. \u201cYes, that will happen. I\u2019ll give you some stuff for that.\u201d</p><p>She laid you back and covered your bottom half with a sheet, then lifting the gown up over the mound that was now your belly, she squeezed some gel onto it. Then moved the device around. Soon, on the screen, you and Chris both saw the outline of your baby. You had seen it before, but the tears still came to your eyes. Yes you were still nervous, but true to his word, Chris was right there. You felt him grab your hand and kiss it. You squeezed his back.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d you said to the screen softly. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you.\u201d</p><p>*********</p><p><i>Tag List: @<b></b>patzammit <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrfefAu06koV1gfG6lscJfg\">@amendes711</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx55KmwsGJmjaVveZB-9tWw\">@misz-adrii</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_Y5eWbIAhjhOafEhwIiBg\">@lizziththegreat</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9T-9GXfN1Ist5mjfNadNdQ\">@whereeverythingisbetter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSP9qzqVrK8KVABdyP626DQ\">@so-not-hotmess</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moX5Hq9zYZ4j2TROG037v7g\">@missnighttigress</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDgzzoy8HvOhxB80iNnDeTg\">@chantelle-x0x</a>\u00a0 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrVv8fLO7cysGZIShbVjFA\">@tomhardy41</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrOaIspqSm-E0C-CDRlkM8w\">@queenofkings121</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNa03FoOmKPuAsjuLb0iriA\">@emmiejames</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mScX-WaGDiSg4sI7625JHzQ\">@keepyourdreamsalive</a> @xcainic <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_TGkM2v9WtBeHMSEBnK7xg\">@ravenditelegatus</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOrzl-8B7be1miZLyqk35rw\">@avengersassemblee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjUFN7b083PQr3eQSh3RkFQ\">@hufflepuffkhaleesi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfpghK0La-oFMDybx1FFywQ\">@thinkxlovexloud</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnxsu4WiJBgj3BjcQKVokHA\">@originalwombatempathwolf</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbX4sWNuBUXVcwsjALyT0uw\">@thegetawaywriter</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYj9iQjNoizyFtnPtt8bOpQ\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCXZ3dv93iyP1BGPRhVUT0g\">@cevansgirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ-__xYtl9MJjmKJU87F0ag\">@winters-beauty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_3WBqouZAYJ0CBcDbUECA\">@twittytelly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN5QWh-nfJPvFMEAAieH-0g\">@withahintofpestoaioli</a> @jbug491 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mivkzsgyrgI2KH8Wkpef6vg\">@heartssick</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mci_U9zXj8hog3t3Dn3NyVg\">@mamaleslie81</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRa8Zg4DbB_MDr-YiHjuUBg\">@jennmurawski13</a></i></p>",

He was acting so nonchalant but you knew that this could be something serious and it was starting to annoy you.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you finally said. \u201cThe condom broke. All it takes is one slip up you know that. This isn\u2019t something to act as if it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>He sighed then scooted up to sit against the headboard next to you.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what happens now? What do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I have to take a test, but I can\u2019t now because it\u2019s too early.\u201d You put your head in your hands. \u201cSo, we wait.\u201d</p><p>Chris was silent for a moment, thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat- what if you are, that could be a good thing, right?\u201d</p><p>You lifted your head to look at him. A good thing?</p><p>\u201cChris, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, that it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing if you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He asked, genuinely confused.</p><p>You shook your head, not wanting to confess your fears right then. \u201cLet\u2019s just wait for the test, all right?\u201d</p><p>You swung your feet off the bed and walked into the bathroom, closing the door behind you and turning on the shower. You didn\u2019t get in right away, but sat on the edge of the tub to think.\u00a0</p><p>If I am, what am I gonna do? I\u2019m not ready for this. I have too much I want to do first. You shook your head again. Now was not the time to get worried. You haven\u2019t even taken the test yet, there was a chance you couldn\u2019t be. You had to hold on to that hope. You heaved yourself off the toilet and stepped into the shower, trying to not worry anymore.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>You had waited three weeks. Yeah, you had missed your period, but then again it could be late. You were stressed out after all and you knew that affected it.\u00a0</p><p>You paced up and down the bedroom, looking at your phone every few seconds to see if you had waited enough time. You sighed and went into the bathroom, where you left the test sitting on the counter - you hadn\u2019t been able to be in the same room as it - and looked down at the little stick on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>There it was, as clear as day, \u201cpregnant\u201d it read.\u00a0 You picked it up and shook it, half out of frustration and anger, half as if it would change the result, but there the word was still in the little window, staring at you.You threw it down and sat on the side of the tub in shock.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s where Chris found you an hour later.</p><p>\u201cBabe, where are you?\u201d you heard his voice call from the living room. You didn\u2019t respond. \u201cBabe?\u201d His voice came closer, he was in the bedroom now.</p><p>You didn\u2019t look up when he popped his head in the bathroom. \u201cThere you are! What are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>You just shook your head, unable to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked looking concerned.</p><p>You opened your mouth to answer, but no words came out. Your mouth felt dry. You cleared your throat and tried again.</p><p>\u201cIt- it\u2019s positive.\u201d The words came out in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cPositive? What\u2019s positive?\u201d He looked around and spotted the test on the ground next to your foot.</p><p>You watched his face as understanding dawned upon it, followed by a big smile. You\u00a0 glared at him but he didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, this is fantastic! I\u2019m gonna be a dad! Oh man, I gotta call mom!\u201d He rummaged in his pocket for his phone.</p><p>\u201cChris, Chris stop,\u201d you said as you grabbed his hand, stopping him from dialing. \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath to calm yourself. \u201cI- I don\u2019t know if I want to have this baby right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, I don\u2019t want to be a mom right now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? So, what are you gonna do? You\u2019re not talkin about getting rid of it?\u201d</p><p>You looked into his eyes that were full of distress and shook your head. You stood up and walked into the bedroom and began pacing again for a minute before speaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2026 exactly. I\u2019m just not ready for this. I feel like I\u2019m too young and\u2026\u201d</p><p>But he cut you off. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not getting any younger here, Y/N! This is a good thing, don\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good thing for who? For you? I\u2019m not ready to go through all that. I\u2019m not ready to be a mother. I have too much I still want to do. What about my job, what about traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can still do that!\u201d He argued. \u201cYou can still do all of that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow!?\u201d You practically shouted, then quieter you asked, \u201cHow can I do all that with a baby on my hip and taking up all my time and money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act as if you\u2019re gonna be alone. I\u2019ll be helping you.\u201d</p><p>You snorted. \u201cChris, you\u2019re gone half the year filming and doing press tours, how often will you be here to \u2018help\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ll just cut back on some of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you will,\u201d you said with a roll of your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d He insisted as you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you said pleadingly, wanting to make him understand. \u201cI cannot do this right now. This, this is one of my biggest fears and now that it\u2019s happened, I can\u2019t see a way to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, this isn\u2019t something to be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? You don\u2019t understand! To me, this is a bigger interruption of my life than it is for you. And\u2026\u201d you paused not wanting to voice your biggest fear of them all.</p><p>\u201cAnd what, Y/N?\u201d He grabbed your hands, but you wouldn\u2019t look at him, keeping your eyes focused on the wall behind him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 what if one day\u2026 you decide you-you\u2019ve had enough,\u201d you stammered out, still not meeting his eyes. \u201cWhat if one day you decide to just leave?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long while before speaking,\u201cHow- how could you say that?\u201d\u00a0 The heartbreak in his voice nearly brought you to tears. \u201cI would never do that! I would never abandon you or our child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now,\u201d you said, your voice thick with unshed tears, shaking your hands from him grip. \u201cBut who\u2019s to say what will happen? If it takes too much of your time or your energy, what\u2019s keeping you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove!\u201d He insisted vehemently. \u201cLove is what\u2019s gonna keep me around. Love for you and love for our child.\u201d</p><p>You kept shaking your head, the tears finally falling. \u201cI can\u2019t Chris, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d And before he could stop you, you stormed out of the room.</p><p>Chris was hot on your heels however. You had grabbed your purse and keys and had your hand on the door knob ready to leave, where you had no idea. He grabbed your arm, stopping you before you walked out.</p><p>\u201cY/N, please, let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already have, Chris. I just\u2026 I need to leave for a while.\u201d You loosened his grip on your arm and opened the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>You got in your car and started it, looking back at your house, you saw Chris standing there with a sad look on his face, you didn\u2019t see the tears though. You turned a way and backed out of the driveway and drove off.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah mom I know I can\u2019t force her,\u201d Chris was saying into his phone hours later. You still hadn\u2019t turned up and he had called his mom to ask for advice. When he had told her that you were pregnant, she had been excited. Then he told her about the conversation between you two, and she settled down to help her son through his feelings.</p><p>\u201cGive her some time, you have to realize what a shock this is for her,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He sighed into the phone. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What else happened?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help but let out a soft chuckle, even over the phone, she knew something was wrong with him.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he began. \u201cShe said she was worried that one day I\u2019d get tired of all of it and just up and leave. I think it\u2019s her biggest fear, being left alone to take care of a baby by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d she said softly, then more sternly, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t do that though. I raised you far better than that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did!\u201d He told her defensively. \u201cI would never do that! You know how long I\u2019ve wanted to be a dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I know, I just had to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do and I can\u2019t tell you what will happen, just give her time. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll all be okay, whatever happens, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>They talked for a little while longer before hanging up. Unsure of what to do, Chris began pacing around the house, trying to find something to occupy himself with. He tried watching tv and reading and cleaning, nothing helped. He finally decided to go find you. He wouldn\u2019t pressure you, like his mother had cautioned against, but he wanted to prove to you that he\u2019d be there for you. He collected his key and headed out to his car; thinking hard about where you might have gone.</p><p>Meanwhile you had drove around for a while, no particular destination in mind. When you finally became tired of just driving around aimlessly, you drove over to the park only a few miles from your house. Getting out, you walked along one of the paths until you found a bench to sit on. You sat back and watched the people enjoying their weekend. It amazed you that there were people who were going on with their lives without this problem looming over them.</p><p>You were lost in thought when you heard a shout. You shook yourself out of it just in time to see a bright blue and green ball bouncing towards you with a little girl toddling after it, her pigtails bouncing. You caught it easily.</p><p>\u201cMy ball!\u201d The girl said to you.</p><p>Her mom ran up behind her. \u201cMia, that\u2019s not nice. Ask the lady for it back.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked up at you, her bright eyes shining in the sun. \u201cMay I pwease have my ball back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, sweetheart,\u201d you said handing it back to her.</p><p>\u201cTank you!\u201d she said with a smile, then she asked you, \u201cToss ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah sure,\u201d you said looking at her mother to see if it was okay. She nodded with a smile and you stood up.\u00a0</p><p>Little Mia tossed the ball with all her might, sending it flying about two feet. You laughed and rolled it back to her, but she missed and toddled off after it. Next, she tossed it to her mom. You three played this game for a while, you talking to her mom while you both watched the little girl chase after the ball, until Mia stopped and pointed.</p><p>\u201cWho that?\u201d</p><p>You and her mom looked around to where she was pointing and there stood Chris. He was watching you with a small smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend,\u201d you told the little girl and her mom, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>You walked toward Chris.</p><p>\u201cSo you found me,\u201d you said to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so I did. Look Y/N, I don\u2019t wanna pressure you into anything\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m just in shock about all this.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI get that, maybe we could talk\u2026\u201d he stopped and smiled again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded behind you and you turned and saw little Mia standing behind you, clutching her ball against her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Y/N, come back and play.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and bent down to talk to her. \u201cOkay, but only if my friend plays too.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked Chris up and down, considering him for a minute, then nodded. She then stepped back and threw the ball to him. He laughed and caught it.</p><p>\u201cOh, that was a good one! You could play for the Patriots with an arm like that.\u201d</p><p>Mia giggled at his praise and watched as he tossed the ball to you, you caught it, then rolled it to Mia.\u00a0</p><p>Your game went on for another twenty minutes or so, before her mom called to her that it was time to leave.</p><p>\u201cIt was so nice meeting you both,\u201d you said shaking her mom\u2019s hand while Mia hugged Chris.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you too,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on Mia, let\u2019s go, honey.\u201d</p><p>Before she walked off she ran and hugged you tight. You lifted her up and looked in her eyes. You both smiled at each other, and you felt yourself relax for the first time in weeks. Mia then reached her arms around your neck and hugged you again.</p><p>\u201cBye, bye Miss Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You hugged her back. \u201cBye, bye Mia.\u201d</p><p>You put her down and she ran over to her mom. You watched them walk away, your hand resting on your stomach. You then turned to Chris.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go talk,\u201d you said softly.</p><p>He nodded and took your hand and steered you onto a path. You two walked hand in hand in deep conversation around the park three times until it had gotten dark.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>You exhaled and stretched your back, trying to alleviate some of the discomfort you felt. You readjusted the gown you had on, then swung your legs. You felt Chris reach out and stop one of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fidgeting, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m nervous.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019ve been here about five times already, you\u2019d think you\u2019d be used to this by now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your reply was cut off by the door opening. In walked your doctor, a cheery middle aged lady with short cropped hair.</p><p>\u201cAll right now, Miss Y/N, how are we doing this month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Chris cleared his throat loudly causing you to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay well I\u2019ve been having really bad heartburn,\u201d you confessed.\u00a0</p><p>Your doctor nodded. \u201cYes, that will happen. I\u2019ll give you some stuff for that.\u201d</p><p>She laid you back and covered your bottom half with a sheet, then lifting the gown up over the mound that was now your belly, she squeezed some gel onto it. Then moved the device around. Soon, on the screen, you and Chris both saw the outline of your baby. You had seen it before, but the tears still came to your eyes. Yes you were still nervous, but true to his word, Chris was right there. You felt him grab your hand and kiss it. You squeezed his back.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d you said to the screen softly. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you.\u201d</p><p>*********</p><p><i>Tag List: @<b></b>patzammit <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrfefAu06koV1gfG6lscJfg\">@amendes711</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx55KmwsGJmjaVveZB-9tWw\">@misz-adrii</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_Y5eWbIAhjhOafEhwIiBg\">@lizziththegreat</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9T-9GXfN1Ist5mjfNadNdQ\">@whereeverythingisbetter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSP9qzqVrK8KVABdyP626DQ\">@so-not-hotmess</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moX5Hq9zYZ4j2TROG037v7g\">@missnighttigress</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDgzzoy8HvOhxB80iNnDeTg\">@chantelle-x0x</a>\u00a0 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrVv8fLO7cysGZIShbVjFA\">@tomhardy41</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrOaIspqSm-E0C-CDRlkM8w\">@queenofkings121</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNa03FoOmKPuAsjuLb0iriA\">@emmiejames</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mScX-WaGDiSg4sI7625JHzQ\">@keepyourdreamsalive</a> @xcainic <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_TGkM2v9WtBeHMSEBnK7xg\">@ravenditelegatus</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOrzl-8B7be1miZLyqk35rw\">@avengersassemblee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjUFN7b083PQr3eQSh3RkFQ\">@hufflepuffkhaleesi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfpghK0La-oFMDybx1FFywQ\">@thinkxlovexloud</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnxsu4WiJBgj3BjcQKVokHA\">@originalwombatempathwolf</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbX4sWNuBUXVcwsjALyT0uw\">@thegetawaywriter</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYj9iQjNoizyFtnPtt8bOpQ\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCXZ3dv93iyP1BGPRhVUT0g\">@cevansgirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ-__xYtl9MJjmKJU87F0ag\">@winters-beauty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_3WBqouZAYJ0CBcDbUECA\">@twittytelly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN5QWh-nfJPvFMEAAieH-0g\">@withahintofpestoaioli</a> @jbug491 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mivkzsgyrgI2KH8Wkpef6vg\">@heartssick</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mci_U9zXj8hog3t3Dn3NyVg\">@mamaleslie81</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRa8Zg4DbB_MDr-YiHjuUBg\">@jennmurawski13</a></i></p>",

He looked down checking and then looked back up at you with a shocked look on his face. It only took you a second to register what that look meant. You collapsed back on the bed, your hand on your forehead.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, Y/N relax\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax! Chris how can I relax? This is serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, babe, it probably means nothing, just one slip up.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>You sat up and stared at him hard. He was acting so nonchalant but you knew that this could be something serious and it was starting to annoy you.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you finally said. \u201cThe condom broke. All it takes is one slip up you know that. This isn\u2019t something to act as if it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>He sighed then scooted up to sit against the headboard next to you.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what happens now? What do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I have to take a test, but I can\u2019t now because it\u2019s too early.\u201d You put your head in your hands. \u201cSo, we wait.\u201d</p><p>Chris was silent for a moment, thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat- what if you are, that could be a good thing, right?\u201d</p><p>You lifted your head to look at him. A good thing?</p><p>\u201cChris, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, that it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing if you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He asked, genuinely confused.</p><p>You shook your head, not wanting to confess your fears right then. \u201cLet\u2019s just wait for the test, all right?\u201d</p><p>You swung your feet off the bed and walked into the bathroom, closing the door behind you and turning on the shower. You didn\u2019t get in right away, but sat on the edge of the tub to think.\u00a0</p><p>If I am, what am I gonna do? I\u2019m not ready for this. I have too much I want to do first. You shook your head again. Now was not the time to get worried. You haven\u2019t even taken the test yet, there was a chance you couldn\u2019t be. You had to hold on to that hope. You heaved yourself off the toilet and stepped into the shower, trying to not worry anymore.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>You had waited three weeks. Yeah, you had missed your period, but then again it could be late. You were stressed out after all and you knew that affected it.\u00a0</p><p>You paced up and down the bedroom, looking at your phone every few seconds to see if you had waited enough time. You sighed and went into the bathroom, where you left the test sitting on the counter - you hadn\u2019t been able to be in the same room as it - and looked down at the little stick on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>There it was, as clear as day, \u201cpregnant\u201d it read.\u00a0 You picked it up and shook it, half out of frustration and anger, half as if it would change the result, but there the word was still in the little window, staring at you.You threw it down and sat on the side of the tub in shock.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s where Chris found you an hour later.</p><p>\u201cBabe, where are you?\u201d you heard his voice call from the living room. You didn\u2019t respond. \u201cBabe?\u201d His voice came closer, he was in the bedroom now.</p><p>You didn\u2019t look up when he popped his head in the bathroom. \u201cThere you are! What are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>You just shook your head, unable to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked looking concerned.</p><p>You opened your mouth to answer, but no words came out. Your mouth felt dry. You cleared your throat and tried again.</p><p>\u201cIt- it\u2019s positive.\u201d The words came out in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cPositive? What\u2019s positive?\u201d He looked around and spotted the test on the ground next to your foot.</p><p>You watched his face as understanding dawned upon it, followed by a big smile. You\u00a0 glared at him but he didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, this is fantastic! I\u2019m gonna be a dad! Oh man, I gotta call mom!\u201d He rummaged in his pocket for his phone.</p><p>\u201cChris, Chris stop,\u201d you said as you grabbed his hand, stopping him from dialing. \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p><p>You took a deep breath to calm yourself. \u201cI- I don\u2019t know if I want to have this baby right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, I don\u2019t want to be a mom right now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? So, what are you gonna do? You\u2019re not talkin about getting rid of it?\u201d</p><p>You looked into his eyes that were full of distress and shook your head. You stood up and walked into the bedroom and began pacing again for a minute before speaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2026 exactly. I\u2019m just not ready for this. I feel like I\u2019m too young and\u2026\u201d</p><p>But he cut you off. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not getting any younger here, Y/N! This is a good thing, don\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good thing for who? For you? I\u2019m not ready to go through all that. I\u2019m not ready to be a mother. I have too much I still want to do. What about my job, what about traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can still do that!\u201d He argued. \u201cYou can still do all of that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow!?\u201d You practically shouted, then quieter you asked, \u201cHow can I do all that with a baby on my hip and taking up all my time and money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act as if you\u2019re gonna be alone. I\u2019ll be helping you.\u201d</p><p>You snorted. \u201cChris, you\u2019re gone half the year filming and doing press tours, how often will you be here to \u2018help\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ll just cut back on some of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you will,\u201d you said with a roll of your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d He insisted as you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d you said pleadingly, wanting to make him understand. \u201cI cannot do this right now. This, this is one of my biggest fears and now that it\u2019s happened, I can\u2019t see a way to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, this isn\u2019t something to be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? You don\u2019t understand! To me, this is a bigger interruption of my life than it is for you. And\u2026\u201d you paused not wanting to voice your biggest fear of them all.</p><p>\u201cAnd what, Y/N?\u201d He grabbed your hands, but you wouldn\u2019t look at him, keeping your eyes focused on the wall behind him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 what if one day\u2026 you decide you-you\u2019ve had enough,\u201d you stammered out, still not meeting his eyes. \u201cWhat if one day you decide to just leave?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long while before speaking,\u201cHow- how could you say that?\u201d\u00a0 The heartbreak in his voice nearly brought you to tears. \u201cI would never do that! I would never abandon you or our child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now,\u201d you said, your voice thick with unshed tears, shaking your hands from him grip. \u201cBut who\u2019s to say what will happen? If it takes too much of your time or your energy, what\u2019s keeping you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove!\u201d He insisted vehemently. \u201cLove is what\u2019s gonna keep me around. Love for you and love for our child.\u201d</p><p>You kept shaking your head, the tears finally falling. \u201cI can\u2019t Chris, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d And before he could stop you, you stormed out of the room.</p><p>Chris was hot on your heels however. You had grabbed your purse and keys and had your hand on the door knob ready to leave, where you had no idea. He grabbed your arm, stopping you before you walked out.</p><p>\u201cY/N, please, let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already have, Chris. I just\u2026 I need to leave for a while.\u201d You loosened his grip on your arm and opened the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>You got in your car and started it, looking back at your house, you saw Chris standing there with a sad look on his face, you didn\u2019t see the tears though. You turned a way and backed out of the driveway and drove off.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah mom I know I can\u2019t force her,\u201d Chris was saying into his phone hours later. You still hadn\u2019t turned up and he had called his mom to ask for advice. When he had told her that you were pregnant, she had been excited. Then he told her about the conversation between you two, and she settled down to help her son through his feelings.</p><p>\u201cGive her some time, you have to realize what a shock this is for her,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He sighed into the phone. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What else happened?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help but let out a soft chuckle, even over the phone, she knew something was wrong with him.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he began. \u201cShe said she was worried that one day I\u2019d get tired of all of it and just up and leave. I think it\u2019s her biggest fear, being left alone to take care of a baby by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d she said softly, then more sternly, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t do that though. I raised you far better than that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did!\u201d He told her defensively. \u201cI would never do that! You know how long I\u2019ve wanted to be a dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I know, I just had to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do and I can\u2019t tell you what will happen, just give her time. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll all be okay, whatever happens, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>They talked for a little while longer before hanging up. Unsure of what to do, Chris began pacing around the house, trying to find something to occupy himself with. He tried watching tv and reading and cleaning, nothing helped. He finally decided to go find you. He wouldn\u2019t pressure you, like his mother had cautioned against, but he wanted to prove to you that he\u2019d be there for you. He collected his key and headed out to his car; thinking hard about where you might have gone.</p><p>Meanwhile you had drove around for a while, no particular destination in mind. When you finally became tired of just driving around aimlessly, you drove over to the park only a few miles from your house. Getting out, you walked along one of the paths until you found a bench to sit on. You sat back and watched the people enjoying their weekend. It amazed you that there were people who were going on with their lives without this problem looming over them.</p><p>You were lost in thought when you heard a shout. You shook yourself out of it just in time to see a bright blue and green ball bouncing towards you with a little girl toddling after it, her pigtails bouncing. You caught it easily.</p><p>\u201cMy ball!\u201d The girl said to you.</p><p>Her mom ran up behind her. \u201cMia, that\u2019s not nice. Ask the lady for it back.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked up at you, her bright eyes shining in the sun. \u201cMay I pwease have my ball back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, sweetheart,\u201d you said handing it back to her.</p><p>\u201cTank you!\u201d she said with a smile, then she asked you, \u201cToss ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah sure,\u201d you said looking at her mother to see if it was okay. She nodded with a smile and you stood up.\u00a0</p><p>Little Mia tossed the ball with all her might, sending it flying about two feet. You laughed and rolled it back to her, but she missed and toddled off after it. Next, she tossed it to her mom. You three played this game for a while, you talking to her mom while you both watched the little girl chase after the ball, until Mia stopped and pointed.</p><p>\u201cWho that?\u201d</p><p>You and her mom looked around to where she was pointing and there stood Chris. He was watching you with a small smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend,\u201d you told the little girl and her mom, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>You walked toward Chris.</p><p>\u201cSo you found me,\u201d you said to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so I did. Look Y/N, I don\u2019t wanna pressure you into anything\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m just in shock about all this.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI get that, maybe we could talk\u2026\u201d he stopped and smiled again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded behind you and you turned and saw little Mia standing behind you, clutching her ball against her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Y/N, come back and play.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and bent down to talk to her. \u201cOkay, but only if my friend plays too.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked Chris up and down, considering him for a minute, then nodded. She then stepped back and threw the ball to him. He laughed and caught it.</p><p>\u201cOh, that was a good one! You could play for the Patriots with an arm like that.\u201d</p><p>Mia giggled at his praise and watched as he tossed the ball to you, you caught it, then rolled it to Mia.\u00a0</p><p>Your game went on for another twenty minutes or so, before her mom called to her that it was time to leave.</p><p>\u201cIt was so nice meeting you both,\u201d you said shaking her mom\u2019s hand while Mia hugged Chris.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you too,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on Mia, let\u2019s go, honey.\u201d</p><p>Before she walked off she ran and hugged you tight. You lifted her up and looked in her eyes. You both smiled at each other, and you felt yourself relax for the first time in weeks. Mia then reached her arms around your neck and hugged you again.</p><p>\u201cBye, bye Miss Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You hugged her back. \u201cBye, bye Mia.\u201d</p><p>You put her down and she ran over to her mom. You watched them walk away, your hand resting on your stomach. You then turned to Chris.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go talk,\u201d you said softly.</p><p>He nodded and took your hand and steered you onto a path. You two walked hand in hand in deep conversation around the park three times until it had gotten dark.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>You exhaled and stretched your back, trying to alleviate some of the discomfort you felt. You readjusted the gown you had on, then swung your legs. You felt Chris reach out and stop one of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fidgeting, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m nervous.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019ve been here about five times already, you\u2019d think you\u2019d be used to this by now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your reply was cut off by the door opening. In walked your doctor, a cheery middle aged lady with short cropped hair.</p><p>\u201cAll right now, Miss Y/N, how are we doing this month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Chris cleared his throat loudly causing you to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay well I\u2019ve been having really bad heartburn,\u201d you confessed.\u00a0</p><p>Your doctor nodded. \u201cYes, that will happen. I\u2019ll give you some stuff for that.\u201d</p><p>She laid you back and covered your bottom half with a sheet, then lifting the gown up over the mound that was now your belly, she squeezed some gel onto it. Then moved the device around. Soon, on the screen, you and Chris both saw the outline of your baby. You had seen it before, but the tears still came to your eyes. Yes you were still nervous, but true to his word, Chris was right there. You felt him grab your hand and kiss it. You squeezed his back.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d you said to the screen softly. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you.\u201d</p><p>*********</p><p><i>Tag List: @<b></b>patzammit <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrfefAu06koV1gfG6lscJfg\">@amendes711</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx55KmwsGJmjaVveZB-9tWw\">@misz-adrii</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_Y5eWbIAhjhOafEhwIiBg\">@lizziththegreat</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9T-9GXfN1Ist5mjfNadNdQ\">@whereeverythingisbetter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSP9qzqVrK8KVABdyP626DQ\">@so-not-hotmess</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moX5Hq9zYZ4j2TROG037v7g\">@missnighttigress</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDgzzoy8HvOhxB80iNnDeTg\">@chantelle-x0x</a>\u00a0 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrVv8fLO7cysGZIShbVjFA\">@tomhardy41</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrOaIspqSm-E0C-CDRlkM8w\">@queenofkings121</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNa03FoOmKPuAsjuLb0iriA\">@emmiejames</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mScX-WaGDiSg4sI7625JHzQ\">@keepyourdreamsalive</a> @xcainic <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_TGkM2v9WtBeHMSEBnK7xg\">@ravenditelegatus</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOrzl-8B7be1miZLyqk35rw\">@avengersassemblee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjUFN7b083PQr3eQSh3RkFQ\">@hufflepuffkhaleesi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfpghK0La-oFMDybx1FFywQ\">@thinkxlovexloud</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnxsu4WiJBgj3BjcQKVokHA\">@originalwombatempathwolf</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbX4sWNuBUXVcwsjALyT0uw\">@thegetawaywriter</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYj9iQjNoizyFtnPtt8bOpQ\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCXZ3dv93iyP1BGPRhVUT0g\">@cevansgirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBb4kX5ZjREpJq2bNqumg4g\">@ajosieface</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ-__xYtl9MJjmKJU87F0ag\">@winters-beauty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_3WBqouZAYJ0CBcDbUECA\">@twittytelly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN5QWh-nfJPvFMEAAieH-0g\">@withahintofpestoaioli</a> @jbug491 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mivkzsgyrgI2KH8Wkpef6vg\">@heartssick</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mci_U9zXj8hog3t3Dn3NyVg\">@mamaleslie81</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRa8Zg4DbB_MDr-YiHjuUBg\">@jennmurawski13</a></i></p>",

Thank you &#128150;&#128149;&#10084;&#65039;&#128156;</b></i></p><p><i>Warnings: Kinda angsty, pregnancy</i></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;Did it break?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can you not be sure!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m checking, I&rsquo;m checking&hellip; Jesus hold on!&rdquo;</p><p>You sat back as you watched Chris. He looked down checking and then looked back up at you with a shocked look on his face. It only took you a second to register what that look meant. You collapsed back on the bed, your hand on your forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, Y/N relax&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Relax! Chris how can I relax? This is serious!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, babe, it probably means nothing, just one slip up.&rdquo;</p><p>You sat up and stared at him hard. He was acting so nonchalant but you knew that this could be something serious and it was starting to annoy you.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris,&rdquo; you finally said. &ldquo;The condom broke. All it takes is one slip up you know that. This isn&rsquo;t something to act as if it&rsquo;s no big deal.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed then scooted up to sit against the headboard next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so what happens now? What do we do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I have to take a test, but I can&rsquo;t now because it&rsquo;s too early.&rdquo; You put your head in your hands. &ldquo;So, we wait.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris was silent for a moment, thinking.</p><p>&ldquo;What- what if you are, that could be a good thing, right?&rdquo;</p><p>You lifted your head to look at him. A good thing?</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, what are you saying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying, that it wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing if you&rsquo;re pregnant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it would!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He asked, genuinely confused.</p><p>You shook your head, not wanting to confess your fears right then. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just wait for the test, all right?&rdquo;</p><p>You swung your feet off the bed and walked into the bathroom, closing the door behind you and turning on the shower. You didn&rsquo;t get in right away, but sat on the edge of the tub to think.&nbsp;</p><p>If I am, what am I gonna do? I&rsquo;m not ready for this. I have too much I want to do first. You shook your head again. Now was not the time to get worried. You haven&rsquo;t even taken the test yet, there was a chance you couldn&rsquo;t be. You had to hold on to that hope. You heaved yourself off the toilet and stepped into the shower, trying to not worry anymore.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>You had waited three weeks. Yeah, you had missed your period, but then again it could be late. You were stressed out after all and you knew that affected it.&nbsp;</p><p>You paced up and down the bedroom, looking at your phone every few seconds to see if you had waited enough time. You sighed and went into the bathroom, where you left the test sitting on the counter - you hadn&rsquo;t been able to be in the same room as it - and looked down at the little stick on the counter.&nbsp;</p><p>There it was, as clear as day, &ldquo;pregnant&rdquo; it read.&nbsp; You picked it up and shook it, half out of frustration and anger, half as if it would change the result, but there the word was still in the little window, staring at you.You threw it down and sat on the side of the tub in shock.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s where Chris found you an hour later.</p><p>&ldquo;Babe, where are you?&rdquo; you heard his voice call from the living room. You didn&rsquo;t respond. &ldquo;Babe?&rdquo; His voice came closer, he was in the bedroom now.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t look up when he popped his head in the bathroom. &ldquo;There you are! What are you doing in here?&rdquo;</p><p>You just shook your head, unable to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He asked looking concerned.</p><p>You opened your mouth to answer, but no words came out. Your mouth felt dry. You cleared your throat and tried again.</p><p>&ldquo;It- it&rsquo;s positive.&rdquo; The words came out in a whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;Positive? What&rsquo;s positive?&rdquo; He looked around and spotted the test on the ground next to your foot.</p><p>You watched his face as understanding dawned upon it, followed by a big smile. You&nbsp; glared at him but he didn&rsquo;t notice.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, this is fantastic! I&rsquo;m gonna be a dad! Oh man, I gotta call mom!&rdquo; He rummaged in his pocket for his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, Chris stop,&rdquo; you said as you grabbed his hand, stopping him from dialing. &ldquo;I think we need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Talk about what?&rdquo;</p><p>You took a deep breath to calm yourself. &ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t know if I want to have this baby right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What I mean is, I don&rsquo;t want to be a mom right now&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not? So, what are you gonna do? You&rsquo;re not talkin about getting rid of it?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked into his eyes that were full of distress and shook your head. You stood up and walked into the bedroom and began pacing again for a minute before speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that&hellip; exactly. I&rsquo;m just not ready for this. I feel like I&rsquo;m too young and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>But he cut you off. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not getting any younger here, Y/N! This is a good thing, don&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A good thing for who? For you? I&rsquo;m not ready to go through all that. I&rsquo;m not ready to be a mother. I have too much I still want to do. What about my job, what about traveling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can still do that!&rdquo; He argued. &ldquo;You can still do all of that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How!?&rdquo; You practically shouted, then quieter you asked, &ldquo;How can I do all that with a baby on my hip and taking up all my time and money?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You act as if you&rsquo;re gonna be alone. I&rsquo;ll be helping you.&rdquo;</p><p>You snorted. &ldquo;Chris, you&rsquo;re gone half the year filming and doing press tours, how often will you be here to &lsquo;help&rsquo; me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ll just cut back on some of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you will,&rdquo; you said with a roll of your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; He insisted as you shook your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris,&rdquo; you said pleadingly, wanting to make him understand. &ldquo;I cannot do this right now. This, this is one of my biggest fears and now that it&rsquo;s happened, I can&rsquo;t see a way to get over it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, this isn&rsquo;t something to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can you say that? You don&rsquo;t understand! To me, this is a bigger interruption of my life than it is for you. And&hellip;&rdquo; you paused not wanting to voice your biggest fear of them all.</p><p>&ldquo;And what, Y/N?&rdquo; He grabbed your hands, but you wouldn&rsquo;t look at him, keeping your eyes focused on the wall behind him. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And&hellip; what if one day&hellip; you decide you-you&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; you stammered out, still not meeting his eyes. &ldquo;What if one day you decide to just leave?&rdquo;</p><p>He was quiet for a long while before speaking,&ldquo;How- how could you say that?&rdquo;&nbsp; The heartbreak in his voice nearly brought you to tears. &ldquo;I would never do that! I would never abandon you or our child!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You say that now,&rdquo; you said, your voice thick with unshed tears, shaking your hands from him grip. &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s to say what will happen? If it takes too much of your time or your energy, what&rsquo;s keeping you around?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo; He insisted vehemently. &ldquo;Love is what&rsquo;s gonna keep me around. Love for you and love for our child.&rdquo;</p><p>You kept shaking your head, the tears finally falling. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t Chris, I can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo; And before he could stop you, you stormed out of the room.</p><p>Chris was hot on your heels however. You had grabbed your purse and keys and had your hand on the door knob ready to leave, where you had no idea. He grabbed your arm, stopping you before you walked out.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, please, let&rsquo;s talk about this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We already have, Chris. I just&hellip; I need to leave for a while.&rdquo; You loosened his grip on your arm and opened the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>You got in your car and started it, looking back at your house, you saw Chris standing there with a sad look on his face, you didn&rsquo;t see the tears though. You turned a way and backed out of the driveway and drove off.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah mom I know I can&rsquo;t force her,&rdquo; Chris was saying into his phone hours later. You still hadn&rsquo;t turned up and he had called his mom to ask for advice. When he had told her that you were pregnant, she had been excited. Then he told her about the conversation between you two, and she settled down to help her son through his feelings.</p><p>&ldquo;Give her some time, you have to realize what a shock this is for her,&rdquo; she told him.</p><p>He sighed into the phone. &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; he paused.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? What else happened?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Chris couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a soft chuckle, even over the phone, she knew something was wrong with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;She said she was worried that one day I&rsquo;d get tired of all of it and just up and leave. I think it&rsquo;s her biggest fear, being left alone to take care of a baby by herself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can see that,&rdquo; she said softly, then more sternly, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t do that though. I raised you far better than that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; He told her defensively. &ldquo;I would never do that! You know how long I&rsquo;ve wanted to be a dad!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I know, I just had to say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I know. I just don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what to do and I can&rsquo;t tell you what will happen, just give her time. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll all be okay, whatever happens, it&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>They talked for a little while longer before hanging up. Unsure of what to do, Chris began pacing around the house, trying to find something to occupy himself with. He tried watching tv and reading and cleaning, nothing helped. He finally decided to go find you. He wouldn&rsquo;t pressure you, like his mother had cautioned against, but he wanted to prove to you that he&rsquo;d be there for you. He collected his key and headed out to his car; thinking hard about where you might have gone.</p><p>Meanwhile you had drove around for a while, no particular destination in mind. When you finally became tired of just driving around aimlessly, you drove over to the park only a few miles from your house. Getting out, you walked along one of the paths until you found a bench to sit on. You sat back and watched the people enjoying their weekend. It amazed you that there were people who were going on with their lives without this problem looming over them.</p><p>You were lost in thought when you heard a shout. You shook yourself out of it just in time to see a bright blue and green ball bouncing towards you with a little girl toddling after it, her pigtails bouncing. You caught it easily.</p><p>&ldquo;My ball!&rdquo; The girl said to you.</p><p>Her mom ran up behind her. &ldquo;Mia, that&rsquo;s not nice. Ask the lady for it back.&rdquo;</p><p>Mia looked up at you, her bright eyes shining in the sun. &ldquo;May I pwease have my ball back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, sweetheart,&rdquo; you said handing it back to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Tank you!&rdquo; she said with a smile, then she asked you, &ldquo;Toss ball?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah sure,&rdquo; you said looking at her mother to see if it was okay. She nodded with a smile and you stood up.&nbsp;</p><p>Little Mia tossed the ball with all her might, sending it flying about two feet. You laughed and rolled it back to her, but she missed and toddled off after it. Next, she tossed it to her mom. You three played this game for a while, you talking to her mom while you both watched the little girl chase after the ball, until Mia stopped and pointed.</p><p>&ldquo;Who that?&rdquo;</p><p>You and her mom looked around to where she was pointing and there stood Chris. He was watching you with a small smile on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my friend,&rdquo; you told the little girl and her mom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p><p>You walked toward Chris.</p><p>&ldquo;So you found me,&rdquo; you said to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, so I did. Look Y/N, I don&rsquo;t wanna pressure you into anything&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. I&rsquo;m just in shock about all this.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;I get that, maybe we could talk&hellip;&rdquo; he stopped and smiled again.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded behind you and you turned and saw little Mia standing behind you, clutching her ball against her.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Y/N, come back and play.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and bent down to talk to her. &ldquo;Okay, but only if my friend plays too.&rdquo;</p><p>Mia looked Chris up and down, considering him for a minute, then nodded. She then stepped back and threw the ball to him. He laughed and caught it.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that was a good one! You could play for the Patriots with an arm like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Mia giggled at his praise and watched as he tossed the ball to you, you caught it, then rolled it to Mia.&nbsp;</p><p>Your game went on for another twenty minutes or so, before her mom called to her that it was time to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;It was so nice meeting you both,&rdquo; you said shaking her mom&rsquo;s hand while Mia hugged Chris.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was nice meeting you too,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come on Mia, let&rsquo;s go, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>Before she walked off she ran and hugged you tight. You lifted her up and looked in her eyes. You both smiled at each other, and you felt yourself relax for the first time in weeks. Mia then reached her arms around your neck and hugged you again.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, bye Miss Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>You hugged her back. &ldquo;Bye, bye Mia.&rdquo;</p><p>You put her down and she ran over to her mom. You watched them walk away, your hand resting on your stomach. You then turned to Chris.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go talk,&rdquo; you said softly.</p><p>He nodded and took your hand and steered you onto a path. You two walked hand in hand in deep conversation around the park three times until it had gotten dark.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You exhaled and stretched your back, trying to alleviate some of the discomfort you felt. You readjusted the gown you had on, then swung your legs. You felt Chris reach out and stop one of them.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fidgeting, sweetheart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m nervous.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? You&rsquo;ve been here about five times already, you&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d be used to this by now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Your reply was cut off by the door opening. In walked your doctor, a cheery middle aged lady with short cropped hair.</p><p>&ldquo;All right now, Miss Y/N, how are we doing this month?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris cleared his throat loudly causing you to glare at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay well I&rsquo;ve been having really bad heartburn,&rdquo; you confessed.&nbsp;</p><p>Your doctor nodded. &ldquo;Yes, that will happen. I&rsquo;ll give you some stuff for that.&rdquo;</p><p>She laid you back and covered your bottom half with a sheet, then lifting the gown up over the mound that was now your belly, she squeezed some gel onto it. Then moved the device around. Soon, on the screen, you and Chris both saw the outline of your baby. You had seen it before, but the tears still came to your eyes. Yes you were still nervous, but true to his word, Chris was right there. You felt him grab your hand and kiss it.

The sun still shone brightly and reflected off the glass windows of the building around you. The sun&rsquo;s warm rays felt like a blessing on your skin as you walked the mile from your office to your home.\u00a0</p><p>Alone in the cool of your apartment you noticed the answering machine light flashing on the home phone. You frowned, hardly anyone ever called the house phone, if they wanted to talk to you they called your mobile or texted you. Puzzled, you pressed the play button:</p><p>Hey sweetheart, your mobile was switched off but I just wanted you to know, I&rsquo;ll be home early tomorrow morning and I&rsquo;m taking you out for dinner tomorrow evening okay? Pick you up at 7.30. I thought it would be nice to getting dinner without Dodger trying to steal our food. See you tomorrow,&ldquo;</p><p>Chris&rsquo;s message sent a shiver from your belly out along your arms and legs to the tips of your toes and fingers. Just knowing he would be back tomorrow made you feel giddy with excitement but it also meant you faced another day just going through the motions and feeling out of place.\u00a0</p><p>You picked your mobile phone out of your bag and switched it on, you had switched it off when you went into a meeting early that day and it had slipped your mind to turn it back on. There were two missed calls from Chris and a picture of Dodger that he&rsquo;d sent.\u00a0</p><p>Friday flashed past, like time had been switched from ultra slow to fast forward, you stood in front of your wardrobe, pushing the clothes around looking for something to wear that evening.\u00a0</p><p>You finally selected a deep blue knee length dress with a sweetheart neckline, you knew the cut flattered your body and the way it hung on you and made you feel good. The doorbell rang at 7.30 exactly, you pulled open the door, your heart was fluttering and you couldn&rsquo;t help but grin at Chris standing there.\u00a0</p><p>He had on a pair of black trousers and a pale blue long sleeve shirt, over his arm he held a soft cream coloured knitted jumper.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Hey,&rdquo; you greeted, a flush traveling up your neck.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you look lovely,&rdquo; he said, kissing your cheek gently.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Looking pretty good yourself,&rdquo; you replied, stepping aside and allowing him in your apartment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to get my shoes,&rdquo; you said disappearing into your bedroom to find your shoes and slipping them on your feet.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; you asked, stepping back into the living room.</p><p>He nodded and stood, he pulled open the front door and allowed you to step through first, he followed you, stepping aside and allowing you to lock the door.\u00a0</p><p>He offered you is arm and the two of you walked down the stairs of your apartment block.</p><p>&ldquo;So where are we going?&rdquo; you asked as the two of you walked toward his car.</p><p>&ldquo;That Italian place that does doesn&rsquo;t really good baked pastas,&rdquo; he replied, his voice sounding a little unsure.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect, I love that place,&rdquo; you replied, he pulled open the car door for you and you got in.\u00a0</p><p>He walked around the front of the vehicle and joined you. He looked over at you and smiled, he placed his hand gently on your bare thigh.</p><p>&ldquo;You do really look lovely tonight,&rdquo; he said. You knew he was being his absolute gentlemanly best, and he was also so charming.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Good enough to eat?&rdquo; you teased.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;And then some,&rdquo; he replied, he turned the key in the ignition and pulled away from the curb.\u00a0</p><p>Over dinner you shared a bottle of wine and he told you all about his trip to LA, there was some sort of project in the works that he couldn\u2019t tell you much about but he was clearly excited by it.\u00a0</p><p>As the evening wore on the atmosphere between the two of you seemed to change, it had started off as jokey and flirty, the way things normally were between the two of you, but after your deserts were cleared away, the tone changed, there was a look on his face that you&rsquo;d not seen before and a tone in his voice that seemed to go straight between your thighs.\u00a0</p><p>He picked up the cheque and wouldn&rsquo;t hear a word about you paying for your half of the bill.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;My treat,&rdquo; he had said firmly as you had gone to get your purse from your bag.</p><p>You had made a sound of protest but he had paid before you had the chance to reply, you had looked at him crossly, he reached across the table and took hold of your hand.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; he had said firmly, &ldquo;if what we&rsquo;re planning goes well I&rsquo;m going to spend the rest of my life owing you for something I can never hope to repay so let me pay for dinner, okay?&rdquo; his voice had been low and the look in his eyes told you that there would be nothing you could say to change his mind.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you replied, looking away from his face.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ever have to apologise to me, not for anything,&rdquo; he said, you looked back and caught his eye, the look in them made your belly quiver.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we go? Back to mine?&rdquo; he added, stroking his fingers over your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; you replied, slipping your hand from his grip and standing. You collected your bag and swung the strap over your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Walking out of the restaurant side by side you felt Chris\u2019s hand gently close around hand, his fingers laced through yours, he\u2019s never held your hand like this before and it made your heart flutter.\u00a0</p><p>The drive back to Chris\u2019s house was quiet and the air between the two of you seemed to crackle with excitement and anticipation. As he pulled out of the parking space Chris brought his hand to rest on your bare thigh, his hand was warm and dry but it sent a cold shiver through your whole body.\u00a0</p><p>At Chris\u2019s house you were greeted by a very excited Dodger who bounced around the two of you, dashing between you and sniffing excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on Bubba,\u201d Chris said quietly to Dodger, \u201cBed time for you,\u201d he said leading Dodger into toward the utility room where his bed was set up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want a glass of wine?\u201d Chris called from the kitchen while you took off your shoes by the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes please,\u201d you called back, making your way down the hall toward the living room, you heard his footsteps on the floor behind you and turned to smile at him.\u00a0</p><p>Chris handed you a large glass of red wine with a shy smile.\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you wanna-\u201d he started, a mischievous look on his face, \u201cShall we watch something\u2026 Or?\u201d he added, cocking his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cI would rather we, just, um,\u201d you replied, your voice disappearing into nothing. Chris grinned at you and his cheeks flushed a pretty pink colour which made you smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAfter you sweetheart,\u201d he said, motioning down the hall toward the half open door of his bedroom, you made your way toward the door, pushing it open and flicking on the light switch, Chris followed behind you, pushing the door half closed behind himself.\u00a0</p><p>You stood in the centre of the room, looking around, it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d been in his room, not by a long way, but before you\u2019d been using his en-suite or sleeping off a hangover. You turned to face him and found Chris watching you closely, he took a sip of his wine and set it down on the table close to the door.\u00a0</p><p>He took two steps toward you, closing the gap between your bodies, \u201cCan I take that for you?\u201d he said, gently taking the glass of wine from your hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not had a drink of it yet,\u201d you said, trying to look cross as Chris placed it on the table beside his own.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never planned on us having enough time to drink it,\u201d he replied, coming back to stand in front of you, he brought his hand up to caress your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d you said, feigning confusion, \u201cwhat else are you planning on us doing,\u201d you added with a playful smirk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA whole, whole lot of stuff,\u201d he replied, bringing his lips down to meet yours. Your hands came to rest gently on his chest, the material of his shirt was soft and smooth and his skin underneath felt hot.\u00a0</p><p>You felt his hand take hold of you at the waist, drawing your body flush against his. Chris\u2019s lips moved gently against yours, his tongue brushed against your lips and your parted them willingly, touching your tongue to his.\u00a0</p><p>You ran your hands up his chest to his shoulders and around the back of his neck, pushing your fingers into his hair. He made a sound deep in his throat has your fingers pushed against his scalp.\u00a0</p><p>You broke away, keeping your face close to his, breathing deeply, letting the scent of him overwhelm you.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you kiss,\u201d you said quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he chuckled deep in his chest, \u201clet me show you some other things you might like,\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Next chapter?

The sun still shone brightly and reflected off the glass windows of the building around you. The sun\u2019s warm rays felt like a blessing on your skin as you walked the mile from your office to your home.\u00a0</p><p>Alone in the cool of your apartment you noticed the answering machine light flashing on the home phone. You frowned, hardly anyone ever called the house phone, if they wanted to talk to you they called your mobile or texted you. Puzzled, you pressed the play button:</p><p>Hey sweetheart, your mobile was switched off but I just wanted you to know, I\u2019ll be home early tomorrow morning and I\u2019m taking you out for dinner tomorrow evening okay? Pick you up at 7.30. I thought it would be nice to getting dinner without Dodger trying to steal our food. See you tomorrow,\u201c</p><p>Chris\u2019s message sent a shiver from your belly out along your arms and legs to the tips of your toes and fingers. Just knowing he would be back tomorrow made you feel giddy with excitement but it also meant you faced another day just going through the motions and feeling out of place.\u00a0</p><p>You picked your mobile phone out of your bag and switched it on, you had switched it off when you went into a meeting early that day and it had slipped your mind to turn it back on. There were two missed calls from Chris and a picture of Dodger that he\u2019d sent.\u00a0</p><p>Friday flashed past, like time had been switched from ultra slow to fast forward, you stood in front of your wardrobe, pushing the clothes around looking for something to wear that evening.\u00a0</p><p>You finally selected a deep blue knee length dress with a sweetheart neckline, you knew the cut flattered your body and the way it hung on you and made you feel good. The doorbell rang at 7.30 exactly, you pulled open the door, your heart was fluttering and you couldn\u2019t help but grin at Chris standing there.\u00a0</p><p>He had on a pair of black trousers and a pale blue long sleeve shirt, over his arm he held a soft cream coloured knitted jumper.\u00a0</p><p>\"Hey,\u201d you greeted, a flush traveling up your neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, you look lovely,\u201d he said, kissing your cheek gently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLooking pretty good yourself,\u201d you replied, stepping aside and allowing him in your apartment, \u201cI\u2019m just going to get my shoes,\u201d you said disappearing into your bedroom to find your shoes and slipping them on your feet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d you asked, stepping back into the living room.</p><p>He nodded and stood, he pulled open the front door and allowed you to step through first, he followed you, stepping aside and allowing you to lock the door.\u00a0</p><p>He offered you is arm and the two of you walked down the stairs of your apartment block.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d you asked as the two of you walked toward his car.</p><p>\u201cThat Italian place that does doesn\u2019t really good baked pastas,\u201d he replied, his voice sounding a little unsure.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPerfect, I love that place,\u201d you replied, he pulled open the car door for you and you got in.\u00a0</p><p>He walked around the front of the vehicle and joined you. He looked over at you and smiled, he placed his hand gently on your bare thigh.</p><p>\u201cYou do really look lovely tonight,\u201d he said. You knew he was being his absolute gentlemanly best, and he was also so charming.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood enough to eat?\u201d you teased.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd then some,\u201d he replied, he turned the key in the ignition and pulled away from the curb.\u00a0</p><p>Over dinner you shared a bottle of wine and he told you all about his trip to LA, there was some sort of project in the works that he couldn\u2019t tell you much about but he was clearly excited by it.\u00a0</p><p>As the evening wore on the atmosphere between the two of you seemed to change, it had started off as jokey and flirty, the way things normally were between the two of you, but after your deserts were cleared away, the tone changed, there was a look on his face that you\u2019d not seen before and a tone in his voice that seemed to go straight between your thighs.\u00a0</p><p>He picked up the cheque and wouldn\u2019t hear a word about you paying for your half of the bill.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy treat,\u201d he had said firmly as you had gone to get your purse from your bag.</p><p>You had made a sound of protest but he had paid before you had the chance to reply, you had looked at him crossly, he reached across the table and took hold of your hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook you,\u201d he had said firmly, \u201cif what we\u2019re planning goes well I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life owing you for something I can never hope to repay so let me pay for dinner, okay?\u201d his voice had been low and the look in his eyes told you that there would be nothing you could say to change his mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you replied, looking away from his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to apologise to me, not for anything,\u201d he said, you looked back and caught his eye, the look in them made your belly quiver.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShall we go? Back to mine?\u201d he added, stroking his fingers over your hand.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d you replied, slipping your hand from his grip and standing. You collected your bag and swung the strap over your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>Walking out of the restaurant side by side you felt Chris\u2019s hand gently close around hand, his fingers laced through yours, he\u2019s never held your hand like this before and it made your heart flutter.\u00a0</p><p>The drive back to Chris\u2019s house was quiet and the air between the two of you seemed to crackle with excitement and anticipation. As he pulled out of the parking space Chris brought his hand to rest on your bare thigh, his hand was warm and dry but it sent a cold shiver through your whole body.\u00a0</p><p>At Chris\u2019s house you were greeted by a very excited Dodger who bounced around the two of you, dashing between you and sniffing excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on Bubba,\u201d Chris said quietly to Dodger, \u201cBed time for you,\u201d he said leading Dodger into toward the utility room where his bed was set up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want a glass of wine?\u201d Chris called from the kitchen while you took off your shoes by the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes please,\u201d you called back, making your way down the hall toward the living room, you heard his footsteps on the floor behind you and turned to smile at him.\u00a0</p><p>Chris handed you a large glass of red wine with a shy smile.\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you wanna-\u201d he started, a mischievous look on his face, \u201cShall we watch something\u2026 Or?\u201d he added, cocking his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cI would rather we, just, um,\u201d you replied, your voice disappearing into nothing. Chris grinned at you and his cheeks flushed a pretty pink colour which made you smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAfter you sweetheart,\u201d he said, motioning down the hall toward the half open door of his bedroom, you made your way toward the door, pushing it open and flicking on the light switch, Chris followed behind you, pushing the door half closed behind himself.\u00a0</p><p>You stood in the centre of the room, looking around, it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d been in his room, not by a long way, but before you\u2019d been using his en-suite or sleeping off a hangover. You turned to face him and found Chris watching you closely, he took a sip of his wine and set it down on the table close to the door.\u00a0</p><p>He took two steps toward you, closing the gap between your bodies, \u201cCan I take that for you?\u201d he said, gently taking the glass of wine from your hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not had a drink of it yet,\u201d you said, trying to look cross as Chris placed it on the table beside his own.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never planned on us having enough time to drink it,\u201d he replied, coming back to stand in front of you, he brought his hand up to caress your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d you said, feigning confusion, \u201cwhat else are you planning on us doing,\u201d you added with a playful smirk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA whole, whole lot of stuff,\u201d he replied, bringing his lips down to meet yours. Your hands came to rest gently on his chest, the material of his shirt was soft and smooth and his skin underneath felt hot.\u00a0</p><p>You felt his hand take hold of you at the waist, drawing your body flush against his. Chris\u2019s lips moved gently against yours, his tongue brushed against your lips and your parted them willingly, touching your tongue to his.\u00a0</p><p>You ran your hands up his chest to his shoulders and around the back of his neck, pushing your fingers into his hair. He made a sound deep in his throat has your fingers pushed against his scalp.\u00a0</p><p>You broke away, keeping your face close to his, breathing deeply, letting the scent of him overwhelm you.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you kiss,\u201d you said quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he chuckled deep in his chest, \u201clet me show you some other things you might like,\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i>Next chapter?

As he pulled out of the parking space Chris brought his hand to rest on your bare thigh, his hand was warm and dry but it sent a cold shiver through your whole body.\u00a0</p><p>At Chris\u2019s house you were greeted by a very excited Dodger who bounced around the two of you, dashing between you and sniffing excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on Bubba,\u201d Chris said quietly to Dodger, \u201cBed time for you,\u201d he said leading Dodger into toward the utility room where his bed was set up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want a glass of wine?\u201d Chris called from the kitchen while you took off your shoes by the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes please,\u201d you called back, making your way down the hall toward the living room, you heard his footsteps on the floor behind you and turned to smile at him.\u00a0</p><p>Chris handed you a large glass of red wine with a shy smile.\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you wanna-\u201d he started, a mischievous look on his face, \u201cShall we watch something\u2026 Or?\u201d he added, cocking his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cI would rather we, just, um,\u201d you replied, your voice disappearing into nothing. Chris grinned at you and his cheeks flushed a pretty pink colour which made you smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAfter you sweetheart,\u201d he said, motioning down the hall toward the half open door of his bedroom, you made your way toward the door, pushing it open and flicking on the light switch, Chris followed behind you, pushing the door half closed behind himself.\u00a0</p><p>You stood in the centre of the room, looking around, it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d been in his room, not by a long way, but before you\u2019d been using his en-suite or sleeping off a hangover. You turned to face him and found Chris watching you closely, he took a sip of his wine and set it down on the table close to the door.\u00a0</p><p>He took two steps toward you, closing the gap between your bodies, \u201cCan I take that for you?\u201d he said, gently taking the glass of wine from your hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not had a drink of it yet,\u201d you said, trying to look cross as Chris placed it on the table beside his own.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never planned on us having enough time to drink it,\u201d he replied, coming back to stand in front of you, he brought his hand up to caress your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d you said, feigning confusion, \u201cwhat else are you planning on us doing,\u201d you added with a playful smirk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA whole, whole lot of stuff,\u201d he replied, bringing his lips down to meet yours. Your hands came to rest gently on his chest, the material of his shirt was soft and smooth and his skin underneath felt hot.\u00a0</p><p>You felt his hand take hold of you at the waist, drawing your body flush against his. Chris\u2019s lips moved gently against yours, his tongue brushed against your lips and your parted them willingly, touching your tongue to his.\u00a0</p><p>You ran your hands up his chest to his shoulders and around the back of his neck, pushing your fingers into his hair. He made a sound deep in his throat has your fingers pushed against his scalp.\u00a0</p><p>You broke away, keeping your face close to his, breathing deeply, letting the scent of him overwhelm you.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you kiss,\u201d you said quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he chuckled deep in his chest, \u201clet me show you some other things you might like,\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i>Next chapter?

You took a seat across the desk from her, sitting a little awkwardly on the large chair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; she asked, she watched you closely, her eyes not leaving your face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you replied easily, it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d been telling everyone for the last three days, and it wasn&rsquo;t a lie, you were absolutely fine but also, nothing was fine at all, your manager nodded and smiled sympathetically.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything at home bothering you?&rdquo; she asked, you knew she was genuinely concerned for you but you found the exchange a little tedious.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; you replied, you could tell she wasn&rsquo;t convinced so you added, &ldquo;honestly Marie, everything&rsquo;s fine I&rsquo;ve just been headachy the last few days,&rdquo; it was easier to lie about physical ailments that to be honest with her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay love,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know if anything is troubling you, anything at all, you can tell me right?\"&nbsp;</p><p>You nodded and smiled, you couldn&rsquo;t ask for a more caring manager,but there were some things you couldn&rsquo;t share, not right now anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I know,&rdquo; you replied with a smile, &ldquo;and I would come to you,&rdquo; you added.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay love,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;anything you need,&rdquo; we reaffirmed before giving you a slight nod that signaled that you were allowed to go back to your desk.&nbsp;</p><p>You floated through the afternoons work and watched the clock relentlessly, watching the minutes tick by until home time.&nbsp;</p><p>Once your work was done for the day you dashed down the office stairs and out into the balmy spring air, it was getting hot and the days were getting longer. The sun still shone brightly and reflected off the glass windows of the building around you. The sun&rsquo;s warm rays felt like a blessing on your skin as you walked the mile from your office to your home.&nbsp;</p><p>Alone in the cool of your apartment you noticed the answering machine light flashing on the home phone. You frowned, hardly anyone ever called the house phone, if they wanted to talk to you they called your mobile or texted you. Puzzled, you pressed the play button:</p><p>Hey sweetheart, your mobile was switched off but I just wanted you to know, I&rsquo;ll be home early tomorrow morning and I&rsquo;m taking you out for dinner tomorrow evening okay? Pick you up at 7.30. I thought it would be nice to getting dinner without Dodger trying to steal our food. See you tomorrow,&ldquo;</p><p>Chris&rsquo;s message sent a shiver from your belly out along your arms and legs to the tips of your toes and fingers. Just knowing he would be back tomorrow made you feel giddy with excitement but it also meant you faced another day just going through the motions and feeling out of place.&nbsp;</p><p>You picked your mobile phone out of your bag and switched it on, you had switched it off when you went into a meeting early that day and it had slipped your mind to turn it back on. There were two missed calls from Chris and a picture of Dodger that he&rsquo;d sent.&nbsp;</p><p>Friday flashed past, like time had been switched from ultra slow to fast forward, you stood in front of your wardrobe, pushing the clothes around looking for something to wear that evening.&nbsp;</p><p>You finally selected a deep blue knee length dress with a sweetheart neckline, you knew the cut flattered your body and the way it hung on you and made you feel good. The doorbell rang at 7.30 exactly, you pulled open the door, your heart was fluttering and you couldn&rsquo;t help but grin at Chris standing there.&nbsp;</p><p>He had on a pair of black trousers and a pale blue long sleeve shirt, over his arm he held a soft cream coloured knitted jumper.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Hey,&rdquo; you greeted, a flush traveling up your neck.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you look lovely,&rdquo; he said, kissing your cheek gently.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Looking pretty good yourself,&rdquo; you replied, stepping aside and allowing him in your apartment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to get my shoes,&rdquo; you said disappearing into your bedroom to find your shoes and slipping them on your feet.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; you asked, stepping back into the living room.</p><p>He nodded and stood, he pulled open the front door and allowed you to step through first, he followed you, stepping aside and allowing you to lock the door.&nbsp;</p><p>He offered you is arm and the two of you walked down the stairs of your apartment block.</p><p>&ldquo;So where are we going?&rdquo; you asked as the two of you walked toward his car.</p><p>&ldquo;That Italian place that does doesn&rsquo;t really good baked pastas,&rdquo; he replied, his voice sounding a little unsure.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect, I love that place,&rdquo; you replied, he pulled open the car door for you and you got in.&nbsp;</p><p>He walked around the front of the vehicle and joined you. He looked over at you and smiled, he placed his hand gently on your bare thigh.</p><p>&ldquo;You do really look lovely tonight,&rdquo; he said. You knew he was being his absolute gentlemanly best, and he was also so charming.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good enough to eat?&rdquo; you teased.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And then some,&rdquo; he replied, he turned the key in the ignition and pulled away from the curb.&nbsp;</p><p>Over dinner you shared a bottle of wine and he told you all about his trip to LA, there was some sort of project in the works that he couldn&rsquo;t tell you much about but he was clearly excited by it.&nbsp;</p><p>As the evening wore on the atmosphere between the two of you seemed to change, it had started off as jokey and flirty, the way things normally were between the two of you, but after your deserts were cleared away, the tone changed, there was a look on his face that you&rsquo;d not seen before and a tone in his voice that seemed to go straight between your thighs.&nbsp;</p><p>He picked up the cheque and wouldn&rsquo;t hear a word about you paying for your half of the bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My treat,&rdquo; he had said firmly as you had gone to get your purse from your bag.</p><p>You had made a sound of protest but he had paid before you had the chance to reply, you had looked at him crossly, he reached across the table and took hold of your hand.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; he had said firmly, &ldquo;if what we&rsquo;re planning goes well I&rsquo;m going to spend the rest of my life owing you for something I can never hope to repay so let me pay for dinner, okay?&rdquo; his voice had been low and the look in his eyes told you that there would be nothing you could say to change his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you replied, looking away from his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ever have to apologise to me, not for anything,&rdquo; he said, you looked back and caught his eye, the look in them made your belly quiver.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we go? Back to mine?&rdquo; he added, stroking his fingers over your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; you replied, slipping your hand from his grip and standing. You collected your bag and swung the strap over your shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>Walking out of the restaurant side by side you felt Chris&rsquo;s hand gently close around hand, his fingers laced through yours, he&rsquo;s never held your hand like this before and it made your heart flutter.&nbsp;</p><p>The drive back to Chris&rsquo;s house was quiet and the air between the two of you seemed to crackle with excitement and anticipation.

A quick color and blow-out at the salon was never a wrong turn, and a\ntrip to the mall couldn\u2019t hurt matters. </p><p>Silencing\nyour phone, and securing the doors of your car with two deeps, your knees\nwobbled like a feeble fawn towards the front steps. It was extravagant, but not\nin an \u201cI\u2019m better than you\u201d type of way, and it\u2019s woodsy endearment was the\ncoziness your nerves needed. </p><p>Taking the\nsteps one by one, hearing a dogs roaring bark behind the solid oak of his front\ndoor, a thought was conceived. </p><p>Was this\u2026 a\nbooty call? Do people even know what that is anymore? Had you been invited to\nthe quiet forest around his home, to glug too much wine, stroll down memory\nlane, and wind up on your back?</p><p>The more\ntroubling conclusion, being you weren\u2019t sure the idea sounded half bad\u2026.</p><p>There\u2019d have\nto be some self-respect. Your shambling life left no room for any more error,\nand you wouldn\u2019t fall into such handsome traps that easily.</p><p>Using the\npane of glass that lined the entry as a reflection check, the door was pulled\nopen, letting the interior nose of music and galloping steps of Dodger loose. </p><p>You cursed\nmentally when you stuck your hand inside the lining of your light jacket to\nfeel the mint still wrapped that you had forgotten to chew on the drive over.</p><p>The handsome\npups\u2019 leash was held onto by an even more handsome man, and both of them seem\nquite eager to greet you. However, one more interested in sniffing around your\nshoes and backside. </p><p>\u201cWoah,\nDodge! Let\u2019s mind our manners, boy.\u201d His owner laughed with squinted eyes.</p><p>He met you\nwith an unexpected, one arm embrace. His fingers snuck under the hem of your\nbreezy springtime cardigan, and rested sprawled across the silk camisole\ncovering the small of your back. Your cheeks brushed together at the ensuing of\nhis gentle, platonic kiss to your face, and his beard felt softer than you\nwould\u2019ve imagined.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\ncould sneak away to hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for\nthe invitation. This place is stunning.\u201d You barely recognized your own voice\nas it\u2019s tone stuttered and dropped into some weird, sad excuse for seductive\nkey. </p><p>Jealous at\nhow effortlessly he could barely graze your skin and have you wanting to shout\nhis name in an explicit context, you rustled your hair to swing its vanilla\nscented sweetness toward him, trying your own much more forced hand at\nseduction. </p><p>With smiling\neyes, he gestured you through the front door, leading the way into the foyer.\nThe simple brightness of its monochromatic scheme added an appealing\ncleanliness and homey feel. A grand piano was nestled near the fireplace, and a\ncandle of spicy sweetness flickered on the white mantle as you heard Dodgers\nleash clang against a metal coat rack.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nstill play?\u201d You asked running a finger over the glossy top of the black\ninstrument positioned on a patterned rug.</p><p>His skinned\nturned red behind the protection of his grizzly beard, and he squeezed his palm\nto the back of his neck. The loose cotton of his shirt teased up his belly,\ngifting you with the sight of a meaty, perfectly exercised torso. Your eyes\ndilated with zealous desire at the way a trail of light hair trailed beneath\nthe band of his relaxed blue jeans.</p><p>\u201cI do, yeah.\nBadly, but I do. I don\u2019t get as much practice as I\u2019d like. Get me drunk enough\n&amp; maybe I\u2019ll play you something.\u201d</p><p>Still the\nsame old guy. The tortured musician with a home on the stage, and a healthy\nliking to beer. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking\nof, I\u2019m heading to the kitchen for a drink. Glass of wine?\u201d He walked in\nreverse down the hall, offering you up a beverage.</p><p>\u201cSounds\nperfect. It better not be the cheap shit either, Evans.

For one, 29, divorced, and your own insurance plan hardly\nclassified you in the kid category. And the boobs. C\u2019mon, Evans.

Both scenarios seemed like a fitting death for the embarrassment\nboiling throughout your pulsing veins. </p><p>\u201cI resent\nthat. I didn\u2019t even trip up a single stair on the way in, thank you very much,\nsir.\u201d Your hair toppled over your shoulder with your sassy, matter-of-fact head\nbob. The loose strand falling airily into your face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so\nright. Seems little Mil is all grown up and coordinated now.\u201d He reached for\nthe lock of your hair in an instant, like he couldn\u2019t resist its\u2019 touch, and\ntwirled it around his pointer finger only once, or twice before pushing it from\nyour eyes.</p><p>The room\nwent silent then, and spun with the drunken tension of unexplained passion. You\nwondered if this whole fa\u00e7ade was some sort of sick way for his ego to get off,\nor had word gotten around to him about your less than happy fortune, and he\npitied you, and old friend, in some way? Sure, you could put an outfit together\nin less then 5 minutes like nobody\u2019s business, and you weren\u2019t exactly a bore\nto be around. But you were such a\u2026 a simpleton compared to him in every sense.\nOften stringy, dull blonde hair no matter what \u201cshine shampoo\u201d you paid for.\nYour legs not even half the length of an average sized woman, and you were\nbarely tall enough to reach the pedals of a car. A tiny, blonde, plain-faced\nwoman with the occasional humorous comeback. Nowhere near the realm of anything\nhe deserved.</p><p>He never\nbroke his laser, blue-eyed stare with yours when he stretched blindly the empty\nhis hand of the bottle, placing it to rest on top of the piano behind you. They\ncolor looping around his pupils was like your own lustful swimming pool where you\nwanted to float wearing nothing but a smile. The rounded point of your chest\ntouched his when he leaned past you, and you prayed the thin lace of your\nunlined bra was just enough to hide the gentle bud of your breast. You were\nsure the news of the split with your husband was indeed knowledge to him,\nbecause he wasn\u2019t the type to ever sink to the level of pursing a taken woman. </p><p>But, was\nthis that? Was the closeness of his body, and his ruthless, studying stares his\nidea of pursuit? Or was your needy, wishful thinking playing tricks on you?</p><p>\u201cI see the\ntan line on your finger, but the ring is missing?\u201d You couldn\u2019t make sense of\nhis words as a question, or a statement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ve heard more than I would have liked for you to, Chris\u2026\u201d</p><p>He gently\nsqueezed at your teeny bicep, his head ghosting a nod just before you dropped\nto shamefully examine your feet.</p><p>\u201cI did hear\nsome stuff. But, it came directly from your moms mouth. Well, straight from\nyour moms mouth, then my moms who she told.\u201d He smiled to alleviate your stresses.\n\u201cBut, if you <i>wanna</i> talk, I\u2019ll listen, Amelia.\u201d </p><p>You wanted\nto. Oh, how curiously bad you wanted to. Something in the velvet ease of his\nvoice willed you cry, and confess, and vent your broken hearts every desperate\npain, and you had no idea why. He was a familiar face, but one from the past.\nYou\u2019d lived an entire life since the two of you had last seen the other, and\nyet something around his eyes hypnotized you to confide there like a terrified\nstow-away, running from the harshness your reality. </p><p>Just as your\nlips parted, and you\u2019d carefully allowed only one tear to totter on the edge of\nyour eyelid, the yelps of an observant dog startled you both. Dodger stood on\nhis hind legs, peeping and panting as he stared out the open curtain of a bay\nwindow. </p><p>\u201cShit\nDodger. Calm down boy, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Chris dropped his hold on you to settle the\ncurious animal. \u201cEveryone else is here. Late as usual.\u201d He remarked. </p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, some\nof the guys are coming to watch the game tonight. You\u2019ll remember most of them.\nTheir wives, too! When I saw you the other day, I knew I had to invite you out\nto visit with everybody since you\u2019re back here now. Thought it would be cool\nfor everyone to catch up, ya\u2019 know?\u201d The man casually explained as he strolled\ntowards the entryway.</p><p>Stupid you.\nAlways stupid, stupid you. Of course, this wasn\u2019t a <i>date. </i>He didn\u2019t want\nto date you. Not now, not ever. You fluffed your mess of curls, and paid for\nyet another outfit you didn\u2019t need simply for nothing. But, the outfit was\ncharged to a credit card in your wallet still under the name of your oh, so\ngenerous, soon-to-be ex-husband, who you were sure wouldn\u2019t mind. So, that part\nwasn\u2019t exactly a problem. </p><p>The signs\nhad been all there though, right? The wine he\u2019d asked you about. The sinful way\nhe whispered and teased into your ear? It definitely seemed flirtatious in the\nmost welcomed of manner. Or, maybe you just desperately wanted it to feel that\nway. Did your ego subconsciously create the boost it needed?</p><p>\u201cMills? Hey,\nyou in there? Amelia?\u201d He pleaded you from your daydreaming state as you swayed\non your feet due to the thoughtful coma you were entranced in.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not\na problem is there, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\nGod, no! Not at all! It\u2019s great, yeah. I\u2019m excited to see them.\u201d Your words\nwavered a little, battling the line of truth and lie. </p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be\nso bad to see some familiar faces, and maybe rekindled some friendships now\nthat you had waywardly returned. But, the scoop neckline of your slinky tank couldn\u2019t\nhide the wave of blushing, blind disappointment climbing your chest. A result of\nhow you felt about having to share him with others. As if he was yours to\nshare.</p><p>People\nwelcomed themselves in, some toting 6-packs, a brown sack marked with the logo\nof a bakery downtown that you knew created all things scrumptious, so you\u2019d have\nto get into the good graces of the woman you didn\u2019t recognize carrying it towards\nthe kitchen. The faces had changed, but a handful of them still had those same\nsmiles, or telling eyes from the past, and they appeared strangely excited to\nsee you. Especially Tucker, someone closer to your age who had grown close to\nChris through tap classes. The only other person on the planet who was informed\non your most secret desires for the handsome Evans in question.</p><p>He nearly sprinted\ntowards you, cradling your now squished, reddened cheeks in his hands. Your\nnose crinkled and eyes rolled with nothing but the truest joy at his fanatical\ngreetings. </p><p>\u201cWell, well.\nIf our girl isn\u2019t where all her little wet dreams from 15-years-ago unraveled, hm?\nAssuming you have been up to his bedroom already?\u201d Tucker pinched your bottom\nplayfully, murmuring into the hollow of your ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, give me\nsome credit, Tuck! What kinda girl do you think I am?!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne who has\nwanted a slice of that man since we were 13, Amelia. That\u2019s who.\u201d</p><p>God, he wasn\u2019t\nwrong. He was the farthest left from anything resembling wrong, and it made the\ncontents of your stomach swimming with the heavy red wine want to escape. You didn\u2019t\ntrust yourself to keep it together with Chris, and hold on to even the tiniest\nlittle remnant of your dignity. Your gut knew all he had to do was say the\nword, and you\u2019d go skipping into his bed like most eager of beavers. But, God.\nYou wanted him to say the word\u2026\u2026</p><p>A/N: I hope you guys are enjoying. This one is a bit unnerving for me, and my readers are used to Hardy content.

A quick color and blow-out at the salon was never a wrong turn, and a\ntrip to the mall couldn\u2019t hurt matters. </p><p>Silencing\nyour phone, and securing the doors of your car with two deeps, your knees\nwobbled like a feeble fawn towards the front steps. It was extravagant, but not\nin an \u201cI\u2019m better than you\u201d type of way, and it\u2019s woodsy endearment was the\ncoziness your nerves needed. </p><p>Taking the\nsteps one by one, hearing a dogs roaring bark behind the solid oak of his front\ndoor, a thought was conceived. </p><p>Was this\u2026 a\nbooty call? Do people even know what that is anymore? Had you been invited to\nthe quiet forest around his home, to glug too much wine, stroll down memory\nlane, and wind up on your back?</p><p>The more\ntroubling conclusion, being you weren\u2019t sure the idea sounded half bad\u2026.</p><p>There\u2019d have\nto be some self-respect. Your shambling life left no room for any more error,\nand you wouldn\u2019t fall into such handsome traps that easily.</p><p>Using the\npane of glass that lined the entry as a reflection check, the door was pulled\nopen, letting the interior nose of music and galloping steps of Dodger loose. </p><p>You cursed\nmentally when you stuck your hand inside the lining of your light jacket to\nfeel the mint still wrapped that you had forgotten to chew on the drive over.</p><p>The handsome\npups\u2019 leash was held onto by an even more handsome man, and both of them seem\nquite eager to greet you. However, one more interested in sniffing around your\nshoes and backside. </p><p>\u201cWoah,\nDodge! Let\u2019s mind our manners, boy.\u201d His owner laughed with squinted eyes.</p><p>He met you\nwith an unexpected, one arm embrace. His fingers snuck under the hem of your\nbreezy springtime cardigan, and rested sprawled across the silk camisole\ncovering the small of your back. Your cheeks brushed together at the ensuing of\nhis gentle, platonic kiss to your face, and his beard felt softer than you\nwould\u2019ve imagined.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\ncould sneak away to hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for\nthe invitation. This place is stunning.\u201d You barely recognized your own voice\nas it\u2019s tone stuttered and dropped into some weird, sad excuse for seductive\nkey. </p><p>Jealous at\nhow effortlessly he could barely graze your skin and have you wanting to shout\nhis name in an explicit context, you rustled your hair to swing its vanilla\nscented sweetness toward him, trying your own much more forced hand at\nseduction. </p><p>With smiling\neyes, he gestured you through the front door, leading the way into the foyer.\nThe simple brightness of its monochromatic scheme added an appealing\ncleanliness and homey feel. A grand piano was nestled near the fireplace, and a\ncandle of spicy sweetness flickered on the white mantle as you heard Dodgers\nleash clang against a metal coat rack.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nstill play?\u201d You asked running a finger over the glossy top of the black\ninstrument positioned on a patterned rug.</p><p>His skinned\nturned red behind the protection of his grizzly beard, and he squeezed his palm\nto the back of his neck. The loose cotton of his shirt teased up his belly,\ngifting you with the sight of a meaty, perfectly exercised torso. Your eyes\ndilated with zealous desire at the way a trail of light hair trailed beneath\nthe band of his relaxed blue jeans.</p><p>\u201cI do, yeah.\nBadly, but I do. I don\u2019t get as much practice as I\u2019d like. Get me drunk enough\n&amp; maybe I\u2019ll play you something.\u201d</p><p>Still the\nsame old guy. The tortured musician with a home on the stage, and a healthy\nliking to beer. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking\nof, I\u2019m heading to the kitchen for a drink. Glass of wine?\u201d He walked in\nreverse down the hall, offering you up a beverage.</p><p>\u201cSounds\nperfect. It better not be the cheap shit either, Evans.

A quick color and blow-out at the salon was never a wrong turn, and a\ntrip to the mall couldn\u2019t hurt matters. </p><p>Silencing\nyour phone, and securing the doors of your car with two deeps, your knees\nwobbled like a feeble fawn towards the front steps. It was extravagant, but not\nin an \u201cI\u2019m better than you\u201d type of way, and it\u2019s woodsy endearment was the\ncoziness your nerves needed. </p><p>Taking the\nsteps one by one, hearing a dogs roaring bark behind the solid oak of his front\ndoor, a thought was conceived. </p><p>Was this\u2026 a\nbooty call? Do people even know what that is anymore? Had you been invited to\nthe quiet forest around his home, to glug too much wine, stroll down memory\nlane, and wind up on your back?</p><p>The more\ntroubling conclusion, being you weren\u2019t sure the idea sounded half bad\u2026.</p><p>There\u2019d have\nto be some self-respect. Your shambling life left no room for any more error,\nand you wouldn\u2019t fall into such handsome traps that easily.</p><p>Using the\npane of glass that lined the entry as a reflection check, the door was pulled\nopen, letting the interior nose of music and galloping steps of Dodger loose. </p><p>You cursed\nmentally when you stuck your hand inside the lining of your light jacket to\nfeel the mint still wrapped that you had forgotten to chew on the drive over.</p><p>The handsome\npups\u2019 leash was held onto by an even more handsome man, and both of them seem\nquite eager to greet you. However, one more interested in sniffing around your\nshoes and backside. </p><p>\u201cWoah,\nDodge! Let\u2019s mind our manners, boy.\u201d His owner laughed with squinted eyes.</p><p>He met you\nwith an unexpected, one arm embrace. His fingers snuck under the hem of your\nbreezy springtime cardigan, and rested sprawled across the silk camisole\ncovering the small of your back. Your cheeks brushed together at the ensuing of\nhis gentle, platonic kiss to your face, and his beard felt softer than you\nwould\u2019ve imagined.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\ncould sneak away to hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for\nthe invitation. This place is stunning.\u201d You barely recognized your own voice\nas it\u2019s tone stuttered and dropped into some weird, sad excuse for seductive\nkey. </p><p>Jealous at\nhow effortlessly he could barely graze your skin and have you wanting to shout\nhis name in an explicit context, you rustled your hair to swing its vanilla\nscented sweetness toward him, trying your own much more forced hand at\nseduction. </p><p>With smiling\neyes, he gestured you through the front door, leading the way into the foyer.\nThe simple brightness of its monochromatic scheme added an appealing\ncleanliness and homey feel. A grand piano was nestled near the fireplace, and a\ncandle of spicy sweetness flickered on the white mantle as you heard Dodgers\nleash clang against a metal coat rack.</p><p>\u201cDo you\nstill play?\u201d You asked running a finger over the glossy top of the black\ninstrument positioned on a patterned rug.</p><p>His skinned\nturned red behind the protection of his grizzly beard, and he squeezed his palm\nto the back of his neck. The loose cotton of his shirt teased up his belly,\ngifting you with the sight of a meaty, perfectly exercised torso. Your eyes\ndilated with zealous desire at the way a trail of light hair trailed beneath\nthe band of his relaxed blue jeans.</p><p>\u201cI do, yeah.\nBadly, but I do. I don\u2019t get as much practice as I\u2019d like. Get me drunk enough\n&amp; maybe I\u2019ll play you something.\u201d</p><p>Still the\nsame old guy. The tortured musician with a home on the stage, and a healthy\nliking to beer. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking\nof, I\u2019m heading to the kitchen for a drink. Glass of wine?\u201d He walked in\nreverse down the hall, offering you up a beverage.</p><p>\u201cSounds\nperfect. It better not be the cheap shit either, Evans. I know how you\noperate.\u201d You bit your tongue at the bold banter of your sarcasm. But, it\nwasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t know your true colors. He\u2019d known you since school age,\nand if he was willing to still speak to your after your raging ugly-duckling\nstages of junior high, surely he could handle a witty tongue.</p><p>When he\ndisappeared behind the wall of the kitchen and glasses clinked, and the\ncabinets slammed, you helped yourself to sight seeing around the empty den.\nPhotos of he and castmates, his nephews and nieces school portraits, and some\nexquisite artwork decorated the walls, alongside the glorious steel shield\nyou\u2019d seen on the big screen. The life of riches, and fame hadn\u2019t rotted\nthrough to who he really was yet it seemed, and you admired the simplicity of\nhis private life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let\nyou touch it for the right price,\u201d he snuck in undetected from the left,\nlong-stem swirling in one hand, and an already half-empty beer bottle in the\nother. </p><p>You eagerly\ngrasped at the wine he had poured for you, desperately pining for something to\ncenter your weak knees from his closeness. Grazing across his full fingertips,\nyour hormones began to dance.</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nyou?\u201d For a brief moment, unsure of what exactly his cheeky comment suggested,\nyou coughed in shock.</p><p>\u201cThe shield,\nAmelia. Don\u2019t make me out to be an asshole here, kid.\u201d Chris rolled his eyes\nwith a faux grin, struggling to hide the slightest bit of insult from your\ninsinuations.</p><p>Wait, <i>kid?</i>\nNo, no, no. For one, 29, divorced, and your own insurance plan hardly\nclassified you in the kid category. And the boobs. C\u2019mon, Evans. Didn\u2019t you see\nthe boobs?</p><p>\u201cHowever, I\nthink the term kid need no longer apply\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Did he\nhear your thoughts? Could he read minds now? He\u2019s Captain America. Of course he\ncould. </i>Your thoughts\nheckled you.</p><p>Abruptly set\non actual fire at the way his eyes painted over you like daggers memorizing\nyour every curve, you choked up a dousing gulp of wine, and it dribbled down\nyour rounded chin. He caught the beads of dark Merlot pooling at the corner of\nyour lips with his thumb, then quite accidentally erotically, sucked the liquid\nfrom his finger with a pop of his half-smiling lips. </p><p>\u201cStill as\nelegant as ever, I see.\u201d Chris winked, and pulled an open-mouth sip of his\nsweating bottle of ale.</p><p>Bury your\nhead in a hole full of poisonous scorpions, or plunge from a plane with no\nparachute? Both scenarios seemed like a fitting death for the embarrassment\nboiling throughout your pulsing veins. </p><p>\u201cI resent\nthat. I didn\u2019t even trip up a single stair on the way in, thank you very much,\nsir.\u201d Your hair toppled over your shoulder with your sassy, matter-of-fact head\nbob. The loose strand falling airily into your face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so\nright. Seems little Mil is all grown up and coordinated now.\u201d He reached for\nthe lock of your hair in an instant, like he couldn\u2019t resist its\u2019 touch, and\ntwirled it around his pointer finger only once, or twice before pushing it from\nyour eyes.</p><p>The room\nwent silent then, and spun with the drunken tension of unexplained passion. You\nwondered if this whole fa\u00e7ade was some sort of sick way for his ego to get off,\nor had word gotten around to him about your less than happy fortune, and he\npitied you, and old friend, in some way? Sure, you could put an outfit together\nin less then 5 minutes like nobody\u2019s business, and you weren\u2019t exactly a bore\nto be around. But you were such a\u2026 a simpleton compared to him in every sense.\nOften stringy, dull blonde hair no matter what \u201cshine shampoo\u201d you paid for.\nYour legs not even half the length of an average sized woman, and you were\nbarely tall enough to reach the pedals of a car. A tiny, blonde, plain-faced\nwoman with the occasional humorous comeback. Nowhere near the realm of anything\nhe deserved.</p><p>He never\nbroke his laser, blue-eyed stare with yours when he stretched blindly the empty\nhis hand of the bottle, placing it to rest on top of the piano behind you. They\ncolor looping around his pupils was like your own lustful swimming pool where you\nwanted to float wearing nothing but a smile. The rounded point of your chest\ntouched his when he leaned past you, and you prayed the thin lace of your\nunlined bra was just enough to hide the gentle bud of your breast. You were\nsure the news of the split with your husband was indeed knowledge to him,\nbecause he wasn\u2019t the type to ever sink to the level of pursing a taken woman. </p><p>But, was\nthis that? Was the closeness of his body, and his ruthless, studying stares his\nidea of pursuit? Or was your needy, wishful thinking playing tricks on you?</p><p>\u201cI see the\ntan line on your finger, but the ring is missing?\u201d You couldn\u2019t make sense of\nhis words as a question, or a statement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ve heard more than I would have liked for you to, Chris\u2026\u201d</p><p>He gently\nsqueezed at your teeny bicep, his head ghosting a nod just before you dropped\nto shamefully examine your feet.</p><p>\u201cI did hear\nsome stuff. But, it came directly from your moms mouth. Well, straight from\nyour moms mouth, then my moms who she told.\u201d He smiled to alleviate your stresses.\n\u201cBut, if you <i>wanna</i> talk, I\u2019ll listen, Amelia.\u201d </p><p>You wanted\nto. Oh, how curiously bad you wanted to. Something in the velvet ease of his\nvoice willed you cry, and confess, and vent your broken hearts every desperate\npain, and you had no idea why. He was a familiar face, but one from the past.\nYou\u2019d lived an entire life since the two of you had last seen the other, and\nyet something around his eyes hypnotized you to confide there like a terrified\nstow-away, running from the harshness your reality. </p><p>Just as your\nlips parted, and you\u2019d carefully allowed only one tear to totter on the edge of\nyour eyelid, the yelps of an observant dog startled you both. Dodger stood on\nhis hind legs, peeping and panting as he stared out the open curtain of a bay\nwindow. </p><p>\u201cShit\nDodger. Calm down boy, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Chris dropped his hold on you to settle the\ncurious animal. \u201cEveryone else is here. Late as usual.\u201d He remarked. </p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, some\nof the guys are coming to watch the game tonight. You\u2019ll remember most of them.\nTheir wives, too! When I saw you the other day, I knew I had to invite you out\nto visit with everybody since you\u2019re back here now. Thought it would be cool\nfor everyone to catch up, ya\u2019 know?\u201d The man casually explained as he strolled\ntowards the entryway.</p><p>Stupid you.\nAlways stupid, stupid you. Of course, this wasn\u2019t a <i>date. </i>He didn\u2019t want\nto date you. Not now, not ever. You fluffed your mess of curls, and paid for\nyet another outfit you didn\u2019t need simply for nothing. But, the outfit was\ncharged to a credit card in your wallet still under the name of your oh, so\ngenerous, soon-to-be ex-husband, who you were sure wouldn\u2019t mind. So, that part\nwasn\u2019t exactly a problem. </p><p>The signs\nhad been all there though, right? The wine he\u2019d asked you about. The sinful way\nhe whispered and teased into your ear? It definitely seemed flirtatious in the\nmost welcomed of manner. Or, maybe you just desperately wanted it to feel that\nway. Did your ego subconsciously create the boost it needed?</p><p>\u201cMills? Hey,\nyou in there? Amelia?\u201d He pleaded you from your daydreaming state as you swayed\non your feet due to the thoughtful coma you were entranced in.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not\na problem is there, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\nGod, no! Not at all! It\u2019s great, yeah. I\u2019m excited to see them.\u201d Your words\nwavered a little, battling the line of truth and lie. </p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be\nso bad to see some familiar faces, and maybe rekindled some friendships now\nthat you had waywardly returned. But, the scoop neckline of your slinky tank couldn\u2019t\nhide the wave of blushing, blind disappointment climbing your chest. A result of\nhow you felt about having to share him with others.

A quick color and blow-out at the salon was never a wrong turn, and a\ntrip to the mall couldn&rsquo;t hurt matters. </p><p>Silencing\nyour phone, and securing the doors of your car with two deeps, your knees\nwobbled like a feeble fawn towards the front steps. It was extravagant, but not\nin an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than you&rdquo; type of way, and it&rsquo;s woodsy endearment was the\ncoziness your nerves needed. </p><p>Taking the\nsteps one by one, hearing a dogs roaring bark behind the solid oak of his front\ndoor, a thought was conceived. </p><p>Was this&hellip; a\nbooty call? Do people even know what that is anymore? Had you been invited to\nthe quiet forest around his home, to glug too much wine, stroll down memory\nlane, and wind up on your back?</p><p>The more\ntroubling conclusion, being you weren&rsquo;t sure the idea sounded half bad&hellip;.</p><p>There&rsquo;d have\nto be some self-respect. Your shambling life left no room for any more error,\nand you wouldn&rsquo;t fall into such handsome traps that easily.</p><p>Using the\npane of glass that lined the entry as a reflection check, the door was pulled\nopen, letting the interior nose of music and galloping steps of Dodger loose. </p><p>You cursed\nmentally when you stuck your hand inside the lining of your light jacket to\nfeel the mint still wrapped that you had forgotten to chew on the drive over.</p><p>The handsome\npups&rsquo; leash was held onto by an even more handsome man, and both of them seem\nquite eager to greet you. However, one more interested in sniffing around your\nshoes and backside. </p><p>&ldquo;Woah,\nDodge! Let&rsquo;s mind our manners, boy.&rdquo; His owner laughed with squinted eyes.</p><p>He met you\nwith an unexpected, one arm embrace. His fingers snuck under the hem of your\nbreezy springtime cardigan, and rested sprawled across the silk camisole\ncovering the small of your back. Your cheeks brushed together at the ensuing of\nhis gentle, platonic kiss to your face, and his beard felt softer than you\nwould&rsquo;ve imagined.</p><p>&ldquo;Glad you\ncould sneak away to hang out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for\nthe invitation. This place is stunning.&rdquo; You barely recognized your own voice\nas it&rsquo;s tone stuttered and dropped into some weird, sad excuse for seductive\nkey. </p><p>Jealous at\nhow effortlessly he could barely graze your skin and have you wanting to shout\nhis name in an explicit context, you rustled your hair to swing its vanilla\nscented sweetness toward him, trying your own much more forced hand at\nseduction. </p><p>With smiling\neyes, he gestured you through the front door, leading the way into the foyer.\nThe simple brightness of its monochromatic scheme added an appealing\ncleanliness and homey feel. A grand piano was nestled near the fireplace, and a\ncandle of spicy sweetness flickered on the white mantle as you heard Dodgers\nleash clang against a metal coat rack.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nstill play?&rdquo; You asked running a finger over the glossy top of the black\ninstrument positioned on a patterned rug.</p><p>His skinned\nturned red behind the protection of his grizzly beard, and he squeezed his palm\nto the back of his neck. The loose cotton of his shirt teased up his belly,\ngifting you with the sight of a meaty, perfectly exercised torso. Your eyes\ndilated with zealous desire at the way a trail of light hair trailed beneath\nthe band of his relaxed blue jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;I do, yeah.\nBadly, but I do. I don&rsquo;t get as much practice as I&rsquo;d like. Get me drunk enough\n&amp; maybe I&rsquo;ll play you something.&rdquo;</p><p>Still the\nsame old guy. The tortured musician with a home on the stage, and a healthy\nliking to beer. </p><p>&ldquo;Speaking\nof, I&rsquo;m heading to the kitchen for a drink. Glass of wine?&rdquo; He walked in\nreverse down the hall, offering you up a beverage.</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds\nperfect. It better not be the cheap shit either, Evans. I know how you\noperate.&rdquo; You bit your tongue at the bold banter of your sarcasm. But, it\nwasn&rsquo;t as if he didn&rsquo;t know your true colors. He&rsquo;d known you since school age,\nand if he was willing to still speak to your after your raging ugly-duckling\nstages of junior high, surely he could handle a witty tongue.</p><p>When he\ndisappeared behind the wall of the kitchen and glasses clinked, and the\ncabinets slammed, you helped yourself to sight seeing around the empty den.\nPhotos of he and castmates, his nephews and nieces school portraits, and some\nexquisite artwork decorated the walls, alongside the glorious steel shield\nyou&rsquo;d seen on the big screen. The life of riches, and fame hadn&rsquo;t rotted\nthrough to who he really was yet it seemed, and you admired the simplicity of\nhis private life.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let\nyou touch it for the right price,&rdquo; he snuck in undetected from the left,\nlong-stem swirling in one hand, and an already half-empty beer bottle in the\nother. </p><p>You eagerly\ngrasped at the wine he had poured for you, desperately pining for something to\ncenter your weak knees from his closeness. Grazing across his full fingertips,\nyour hormones began to dance.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse\nyou?&rdquo; For a brief moment, unsure of what exactly his cheeky comment suggested,\nyou coughed in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;The shield,\nAmelia. Don&rsquo;t make me out to be an asshole here, kid.&rdquo; Chris rolled his eyes\nwith a faux grin, struggling to hide the slightest bit of insult from your\ninsinuations.</p><p>Wait, <i>kid?</i>\nNo, no, no. For one, 29, divorced, and your own insurance plan hardly\nclassified you in the kid category. And the boobs. C&rsquo;mon, Evans. Didn&rsquo;t you see\nthe boobs?</p><p>&ldquo;However, I\nthink the term kid need no longer apply&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>Did he\nhear your thoughts? Could he read minds now? He&rsquo;s Captain America. Of course he\ncould. </i>Your thoughts\nheckled you.</p><p>Abruptly set\non actual fire at the way his eyes painted over you like daggers memorizing\nyour every curve, you choked up a dousing gulp of wine, and it dribbled down\nyour rounded chin. He caught the beads of dark Merlot pooling at the corner of\nyour lips with his thumb, then quite accidentally erotically, sucked the liquid\nfrom his finger with a pop of his half-smiling lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Still as\nelegant as ever, I see.&rdquo; Chris winked, and pulled an open-mouth sip of his\nsweating bottle of ale.</p><p>Bury your\nhead in a hole full of poisonous scorpions, or plunge from a plane with no\nparachute? Both scenarios seemed like a fitting death for the embarrassment\nboiling throughout your pulsing veins. </p><p>&ldquo;I resent\nthat. I didn&rsquo;t even trip up a single stair on the way in, thank you very much,\nsir.&rdquo; Your hair toppled over your shoulder with your sassy, matter-of-fact head\nbob. The loose strand falling airily into your face.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so\nright. Seems little Mil is all grown up and coordinated now.&rdquo; He reached for\nthe lock of your hair in an instant, like he couldn&rsquo;t resist its&rsquo; touch, and\ntwirled it around his pointer finger only once, or twice before pushing it from\nyour eyes.</p><p>The room\nwent silent then, and spun with the drunken tension of unexplained passion. You\nwondered if this whole fa&ccedil;ade was some sort of sick way for his ego to get off,\nor had word gotten around to him about your less than happy fortune, and he\npitied you, and old friend, in some way? Sure, you could put an outfit together\nin less then 5 minutes like nobody&rsquo;s business, and you weren&rsquo;t exactly a bore\nto be around. But you were such a&hellip; a simpleton compared to him in every sense.\nOften stringy, dull blonde hair no matter what &ldquo;shine shampoo&rdquo; you paid for.\nYour legs not even half the length of an average sized woman, and you were\nbarely tall enough to reach the pedals of a car. A tiny, blonde, plain-faced\nwoman with the occasional humorous comeback. Nowhere near the realm of anything\nhe deserved.</p><p>He never\nbroke his laser, blue-eyed stare with yours when he stretched blindly the empty\nhis hand of the bottle, placing it to rest on top of the piano behind you. They\ncolor looping around his pupils was like your own lustful swimming pool where you\nwanted to float wearing nothing but a smile. The rounded point of your chest\ntouched his when he leaned past you, and you prayed the thin lace of your\nunlined bra was just enough to hide the gentle bud of your breast. You were\nsure the news of the split with your husband was indeed knowledge to him,\nbecause he wasn&rsquo;t the type to ever sink to the level of pursing a taken woman. </p><p>But, was\nthis that? Was the closeness of his body, and his ruthless, studying stares his\nidea of pursuit? Or was your needy, wishful thinking playing tricks on you?</p><p>&ldquo;I see the\ntan line on your finger, but the ring is missing?&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t make sense of\nhis words as a question, or a statement.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure\nyou&rsquo;ve heard more than I would have liked for you to, Chris&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He gently\nsqueezed at your teeny bicep, his head ghosting a nod just before you dropped\nto shamefully examine your feet.</p><p>&ldquo;I did hear\nsome stuff. But, it came directly from your moms mouth. Well, straight from\nyour moms mouth, then my moms who she told.&rdquo; He smiled to alleviate your stresses.\n&ldquo;But, if you <i>wanna</i> talk, I&rsquo;ll listen, Amelia.&rdquo; </p><p>You wanted\nto. Oh, how curiously bad you wanted to. Something in the velvet ease of his\nvoice willed you cry, and confess, and vent your broken hearts every desperate\npain, and you had no idea why. He was a familiar face, but one from the past.\nYou&rsquo;d lived an entire life since the two of you had last seen the other, and\nyet something around his eyes hypnotized you to confide there like a terrified\nstow-away, running from the harshness your reality. </p><p>Just as your\nlips parted, and you&rsquo;d carefully allowed only one tear to totter on the edge of\nyour eyelid, the yelps of an observant dog startled you both. Dodger stood on\nhis hind legs, peeping and panting as he stared out the open curtain of a bay\nwindow. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit\nDodger. Calm down boy, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Chris dropped his hold on you to settle the\ncurious animal. &ldquo;Everyone else is here. Late as usual.&rdquo; He remarked. </p><p>&ldquo;Everyone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, some\nof the guys are coming to watch the game tonight. You&rsquo;ll remember most of them.\nTheir wives, too! When I saw you the other day, I knew I had to invite you out\nto visit with everybody since you&rsquo;re back here now. Thought it would be cool\nfor everyone to catch up, ya&rsquo; know?&rdquo; The man casually explained as he strolled\ntowards the entryway.</p><p>Stupid you.\nAlways stupid, stupid you. Of course, this wasn&rsquo;t a <i>date. </i>He didn&rsquo;t want\nto date you. Not now, not ever. You fluffed your mess of curls, and paid for\nyet another outfit you didn&rsquo;t need simply for nothing. But, the outfit was\ncharged to a credit card in your wallet still under the name of your oh, so\ngenerous, soon-to-be ex-husband, who you were sure wouldn&rsquo;t mind. So, that part\nwasn&rsquo;t exactly a problem. </p><p>The signs\nhad been all there though, right? The wine he&rsquo;d asked you about. The sinful way\nhe whispered and teased into your ear? It definitely seemed flirtatious in the\nmost welcomed of manner. Or, maybe you just desperately wanted it to feel that\nway. Did your ego subconsciously create the boost it needed?</p><p>&ldquo;Mills? Hey,\nyou in there? Amelia?&rdquo; He pleaded you from your daydreaming state as you swayed\non your feet due to the thoughtful coma you were entranced in.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not\na problem is there, sweetheart?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no.\nGod, no! Not at all! It&rsquo;s great, yeah. I&rsquo;m excited to see them.&rdquo; Your words\nwavered a little, battling the line of truth and lie. </p><p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be\nso bad to see some familiar faces, and maybe rekindled some friendships now\nthat you had waywardly returned. But, the scoop neckline of your slinky tank couldn&rsquo;t\nhide the wave of blushing, blind disappointment climbing your chest. A result of\nhow you felt about having to share him with others. As if he was yours to\nshare.</p><p>People\nwelcomed themselves in, some toting 6-packs, a brown sack marked with the logo\nof a bakery downtown that you knew created all things scrumptious, so you&rsquo;d have\nto get into the good graces of the woman you didn&rsquo;t recognize carrying it towards\nthe kitchen. The faces had changed, but a handful of them still had those same\nsmiles, or telling eyes from the past, and they appeared strangely excited to\nsee you. Especially Tucker, someone closer to your age who had grown close to\nChris through tap classes. The only other person on the planet who was informed\non your most secret desires for the handsome Evans in question.</p><p>He nearly sprinted\ntowards you, cradling your now squished, reddened cheeks in his hands. Your\nnose crinkled and eyes rolled with nothing but the truest joy at his fanatical\ngreetings. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, well.\nIf our girl isn&rsquo;t where all her little wet dreams from 15-years-ago unraveled, hm?\nAssuming you have been up to his bedroom already?&rdquo; Tucker pinched your bottom\nplayfully, murmuring into the hollow of your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, give me\nsome credit, Tuck! What kinda girl do you think I am?!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One who has\nwanted a slice of that man since we were 13, Amelia. That&rsquo;s who.&rdquo;</p><p>God, he wasn&rsquo;t\nwrong. He was the farthest left from anything resembling wrong, and it made the\ncontents of your stomach swimming with the heavy red wine want to escape. You didn&rsquo;t\ntrust yourself to keep it together with Chris, and hold on to even the tiniest\nlittle remnant of your dignity. Your gut knew all he had to do was say the\nword, and you&rsquo;d go skipping into his bed like most eager of beavers. But, God.\nYou wanted him to say the word&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>A/N: I hope you guys are enjoying. This one is a bit unnerving for me, and my readers are used to Hardy content.

You\u2019re full of surprises, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You press your lips to the nape of his neck lightly and mumble gently into the soft skin. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard and you feel his big warm hands lightly shaking on your skin.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re nothing but trouble Ms. Y/l/n,\u201d he practically rasps, his voice strained and husky.</p><p>Uncaring if you\u2019re crossing any lines even by simply being in his presence right now, you laugh softly, pressing closer to his warm chest and letting out a content sigh.</p><p>You break away from him, looking up at his face. \u201cThank you,\u201d you manage to say sincerely through your drunken gaze. \u201cFor saving me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI wasn&rsquo;t going to let him touch you like that.\u201d </p><p>You shudder in his arms at the thought of whatever it was that James was planning to do with you. \u201cHe misunderstood my intentions with him. I only danced with him because it seemed like fun a fun thing to do at the time. But that\u2019s all it was. Dancing. And I let him touch me a bit because I thought it was innocent. But then he didn\u2019t want to stop when I told him to.\u201d</p><p>At this, all signs of lust and humor are gone from his face and he halts his brisk walk in the middle of a lonely street.</p><p>You furrow your brows confusedly at him as he sets you down on the ground gently. You hold onto his neck for support as your legs wobble slightly before entirely untangling yourself from him.</p><p>The street is completely pitch black aside from a single streetlight which only illuminates half of both of you. </p><p>\u201cYou can walk on your own from here on out. My car\u2019s only a few blocks away,\u201d he mumbles coldly over his shoulder at you, stalking ahead. </p><p>You raise a brow at his sudden shift in attitude. \u201cOkay&hellip;\u201d you mumble to yourself, clumsily stumbling on behind him. </p><p>It only takes a few minutes of you consistently cursing your drunkness and heels for your inability to walk properly before Mr. Evans stops walking abruptly, causing you to crash head-first against his strong back. You grunt when your nose gets crushed on his firm muscles.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d You stumble back, rubbing the sore spot frantically in an attempt to massage the ache away. <br/></p><p> When you look back up at him, though, you\u2019re shocked to find that he\u2019s taken his sunglasses off, bright blue eyes now glaring holes into you.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you even thinking Y/n? Huh!?\u201d He hisses.</p><p>You blink at him slowly, whiplashing at his sudden change in demeanor. \u201cWha-what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He laughs dryly, jabbing an angry finger directly at you. \u201cOh my- I <i>mean</i> that I literally just had to pry off and beat the living hell out of one of my goddam students <i>for you</i>!\u201d</p><p>You raise an indignant brow at his accusatory tone. Like this was somehow <i>your </i>fucking fault.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s my fault, <i>how </i>exactly?\u201d</p><p>He scoffs. \u201cWell, You came <i>alone </i>to a fucking <i>party,</i> for starters. I mean,\u201d he licks his lips, laughing humorlessly. \u201cWhat girl your age fucking does that!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t! Margo had to leave early for a family emergency,\u201d you quickly defend before quietly adding; \u201cand you didn\u2019t <i>have </i>to beat James up like that.\u201d</p><p>He runs his long fingers through his hair making his hoodie fall off and licks his lips in pure frustration again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have- <i>I didn\u2019t have to beat James up like that!</i>\u201d He laughs darkly mocking your statement before looking down at you incredulously. </p><p>\u201cHe was putting his damn hands on you sweetheart! He was going to drag you off to god-knows-where to-\u201c he instantly cuts himself off, sucking in a sharp breath. His eyes screw shut and his jaw clenches tightly, ticking.</p><p>\u201cShit, just thinking about it makes me wanna go back in there to finish what I started,\u201d he growls so low under his breath that if it wasn\u2019t for the isolation of the place you were in, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear him.</p><p>His eyes turn to you once more, the heat of his anger warming your skin as he slowly moves in, stalking up to you with avid, determined steps. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo <i>yes</i>, I did have to beat him up like that. Because he\u2019s a goddam scum bag who shouldn\u2019t be forcing himself on girls. <i>Especially </i>you!\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s completely red in the face, the veins of his neck prominently protruding from his neck as well as from his forehead. </p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d you pause, frowning in confusion at him. <br/></p><p>He freezes as well and for a second, an expression that screamed \u2018oops!\u2019 flashed on his face before being instantly replaced with an exasperated sigh. \u201cWell, yeah. Because you\u2019re&hellip;<i>you</i>!\u201d he seems flustered, motioning to you loosely. </p><p>You raise an indignant brow, feeling like he\u2019s somehow secretly insulting you. \u201cWhat\u2019s <i>that </i>supposed to mean?\u201d </p><p>He smirks cynically. \u201cC\u2019 mon, Y/n! Let\u2019s not fool ourselves. That party is not exactly your scene. You\u2019re naive and an innocent sweetheart.\u201d <br/></p><p>You can\u2019t help it when your alcohol-infested blood boils at his words which were right but nevertheless presumptuous and arrogant.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I already fucking told you to stop calling me that,\u201d you hiss venomously. \u201cSecondly, I\u2019m <i>not </i>fucking innocent,\u201d you practically scream, balling your fists. \u00a0</p><p>He laughs at you. He fucking <i>laughs </i>at you!\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s making you feel powerless and small and you\u2019re completely in the dark for his reasoning behind this sudden display of assholery. He seemed completely fine just a minute ago, but as soon as you mentioned dancing with James, it\u2019s like a switch just flipped inside of him.</p><p>You shove him back by his strong chest, and as he was completely caught off guard by your tiny hands, he stumbles back slightly, his heels catching him before he completely fell on his ass.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d You point a threatening finger at him, glaring holes into his head. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so fucking upset anyways!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause of <i>you</i>!\u201d He screams so loud, you almost jump out of your skin.\u00a0</p><p>Shocked into silence, you glance up at him, your eyes wide.\u00a0</p><p>You take a moment to look closely at this part of Mr. Evans. The infuriated one. That darkness was back in his eyes, but somehow even darker than before. More untamed and wild. Swirling in his eyes is utter hurt and frustration and he looks even more uncontrolled with his hair all disheveled from his constant running his fingers through the dirty blonde locks. His lips pursed tightly, his nostrils flared and his hands balled into tightly-clenched fists, barely holding back his frustrations. <br/></p><p>His eyes were alive with a fire that fueled that darkness further and you\u2019d never felt more attracted to something so aggressive and scary-looking. You wanted the warmth of that fire to envelop you in a tight embrace, to ignite your very being alive with its flames. To make you feel something other than despair and frustration and numbness. \u00a0 </p><p> \u201c<i>You\u2019re </i>the fucking reason I\u2019m so messed up, Y/n! Look at me!\u201d He motions to himself desperately, his voice strained. Then he motions around him, throwing his hands up. \u201cLook where I\u2019m fucking at right now! It\u2019s three in the goddam morning and here I am, in the middle of a fucking street arguing with one of my <i>students </i>about something I shouldn\u2019t even <i>be </i>upset by!\u201d He laughs dryly, furious eyes locking on yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause why should I give a flying fuck if you\u2019re dancing with another guy?! Why the hell should I <i>give a shit </i>if you\u2019re letting him put his grubby hands on you?&hellip;\u201d his voice falters towards the end of his sentence, chest heaving.\u00a0</p><p>Leaning on a nearby wall, he runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even be here right now. If somebody, <i>anybody</i>\u00a0in that party recognized me, it could <i>literally </i>ruin my life. What the fuck am I even doing here right now?\u201d he breathes to himself. </p><p>Even with the sudden urge to grab his face and kiss the living hell out of him burning and sizzling slowly in the pit of your gut, you know what he\u2019s trying to say. He\u2019s done so much for you already. Showing up here like that was a huge risk and you were partially at fault for calling him. </p><p>You feel undeniably guilty now. </p><p>It\u2019s quiet for a few seconds, with nothing but your heavy breathing filling in the tense, silent atmosphere all around you before you finally speak up, voice shaky and apologetic.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Mr. Evans? You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry for making you come all the way here.\u201d You smile up at him with a sincere but slightly sad smile as you couldn\u2019t hide that tinge of pain you felt. \u201cAnd thanks for everything. Really. I know it\u2019s far more than you have to do for any of your students. I\u2019ll see you on Monday.\u201d </p><p>And with that, you spin on your heel, decisively walking in the opposite direction of where he\u2019d been taking you. </p><p>You only get as far as a few steps from him before Mr. Evans\u2019s big warm hand is wrapping around your uninjured wrist, halting you mid-step and spinning you back around to face him. </p><p>You frown confusedly. \u201cMr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t <i>understand </i>Y/n,\u201d he whispers huskily, chest still heaving with anger, eyes set heavily on you. \u201cI knew this had the potential to ruin me in an instant and I still came.\u201d <br/></p><p>You open your mouth to speak, but he immediately cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realize?\u201d his laugh isn\u2019t mocking or dry this time. It\u2019s strained and tired and defeated. Your heart squeezes painfully in your chest at the sound of it. <br/></p><p>\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that you called me. It\u2019s that I <i>still </i>fucking came! Because you\u2019re driving me absolutely insane sweetheart. I can\u2019t fucking sleep or eat or teach or think or do <i>anything </i>without thinking about you. And it\u2019s killing me to see you walk your pretty little ass around school and my class and <i>not </i>think about that kiss and how much I wanna fucking do it again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His gaze flickers to your slightly parted lips and you can feel your heart positively\u00a0<i>hammering </i>at his heated confession, ready to rid itself of any inhibitions you may have about any of this in an instant/\u00a0</p><p>Slowly, eyes half-hooded and set still on your lips, he begins backing you back against the wall behind you, opposite of him. You stumble backward, entirely <i>spellbound </i>by his dark blue eyes.\u00a0</p><p>His steps are slow and deliberate, giving you the chance to leave at any point.\u00a0 He knew you wouldn\u2019t though. He was letting you know that <i>he </i>knew you wouldn\u2019t. Hell, that you <i>couldn\u2019t. </i>Even if you tried.\u00a0</p><p>Along with that, he was making sure to prolong the aching in your core for as long as possible. To intensify the desperate anticipation with which you awaited his lips. His touch. </p><p>You can\u2019t fight him. Both you and he know you don&rsquo;t <i>want </i>to fight him either. </p><p>A barely-audible gasp leaves your lips when your back meets the cold of a stone wall of some random building. </p><p>He wraps his arms around your hips first, pressing his forehead to yours, brushing his nose on yours softly, teasing. His eyes flutter as he drags his gaze back up to your own heated gaze.</p><p>You could see it in his eyes. He knew this was wrong. He knew the consequences this would eventually bring, but he didn\u2019t <i>care</i>. He yearned for your lips just like you did his.\u00a0</p><p>Gently, he massages his thumbs into the thin, soft fabric of your dress, leaving you breathless and entirely in awe of his power over you. Then his hands, leaving a blazing trail in their wake, make their way up to your waist, squeezing at the skin softly as if to let you know what was happening was real. That you weren\u2019t dreaming any of things he was doing to you right now.\u00a0<br/></p><p>That you weren\u2019t making up the requited emotions he felt for you as well.\u00a0</p><p>Goosebumps rose on your skin and that familiar shudder rippled down your spine in a bold reminder that you were his. His to touch, his to kiss, his to keep. You could never feel the way he made you feel with someone else. Someone else\u2019s touch would never ignite the fire in your belly like his did. Not even <i>close</i>. </p><p>\u201cMr.-\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have fucking called me, Y/n,\u201d he hums huskily against your lips.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>You exhale shakily into his mouth, your breaths mingling, your very being trembling in delight. Unable to say anything, you just look at him desperately,</p><p>His hands make their torturously delicious way up to your neck where he trails a single finger to your shoulders and nape back and forth gently. You sigh in relief, eyes closing in pure ecstasy. </p><p>Finally, his fingers wrap around your cheek and chin, lifting your gaze to properly meet his.\u00a0</p><p>Your heart is racing in your chest so fast, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s going to fall out any second now.\u00a0</p><p>His eyes are dark with anger and lust and frustration, but they\u2019re also lighted with something soft and caring. Something you were almost completely convinced resembled <i>love</i>. </p><p>You wanted to drown in his touch. His fragrance obscuring all your senses, putting the vodka you\u2019d consumed earlier to shame. It made you feel more intoxicated than the alcohol ever did. Though, instead of numbing you down, it only intensified that painful yearning in your chest and that aggressive throbbing in your core.\u00a0</p><p>Nothing ever hurt better than being in his arms. </p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i>,\u201d you strain, pushing against the huge lump in your throat. \u201cWe have to stop Mr. Evans.\u201d Your voice is weak, making it clear to him and yourself that you didn\u2019t, in fact, want to \u2018stop\u2019. <br/></p><p><i>God</i>, no. </p><p>But you had to make an effort to stop this from happening at least. It was wrong. You both knew it and somehow&hellip;you didn\u2019t care. </p><p>\u201cI know sweetheart. I know. But I don\u2019t think I can hold back anymore. I just want to&hellip;\u201d his gaze flickers right back to your lips and he groans under his breath. \u201cJesus fuck&hellip;\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re left breathing against his mouth in raggedy breaths, eyes flickering between his lips and his eyes, admiring the sharp and chiseled edges of his face along the way. The dimmed light of the abandoned street illuminated his face enough so you could admire the keen shape of his jaw, the angular slope of his nose and the soft curves and dips of his plump pink lips. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to run around looking this fucking ravishing and expect me to be able to resist you,\u201d he all but growls into you. \u201cYou don\u2019t even fucking know what you do to me, do you?\u201d <br/></p><p>Then he presses his entire body to yours. Your chests and lower halves now hugged the one to the other, you can feel just how much you\u2019ve affected him and it leaves you spent, that throbbing in your core intensifying by a thousand. Your gut flips in you and a flush of heat spreads through you like wildfire.</p><p> As your heated gazes flare-up in unison, both knowing of what was coming next, you know there\u2019s no going back. </p><p>\u201cI want you to kiss me, Mr. Evans.\u201d \u00a0Your voice is needy and desperate but you can\u2019t find it in you to give a single damn.</p><p>And that\u2019s all it takes for the dam to break. In the blink of an eye, Mr. Evans is crashing his lips against yours, <i>hard</i>.\u00a0</p><p>You suck in a sharp breath as soon as you feel his soft lips make contact with yours. Your chest burned intensely as his wet mouth wrapped around yours harshly, his hands cupping your jaw and roughly tugging you closer to him.\u00a0</p><p>This kiss is in sharp contrast to your first one, is the first thing you notice. This kiss is rugged and demanding and filled with want much more than the need to comfort eachother.\n\n<br/></p><p>You were both filled up with a desire and need for eachother that was bottomless. And selfish. \n\n</p><p>Merely wanting to feel him as close to you as possible, you snake your arms around his neck and draw him closer.\u00a0</p><p>Your stomach clenches as you feverishly claimed each other&rsquo;s mouths. </p><p>\n\n Even with the tempo of the kiss set so high thanks to the wanton yearning finally being released within you, you still moved in sync with each other.\n\nHis lips and yours worked together like they were always meant to do so, the delightful feeling of his scruff rubbing against your skin sending another wave of pleasant shivers through your body.\u00a0</p><p>His soft lips controlled yours with so much passion and unfulfilled want that it almost made your legs give out beneath him. His hold on your waist was almost possessive as he pressed you harder against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>Your mouth acted upon its own free will, tugging his bottom lip in between your teeth and biting it slowly. You wanted to gauge for what reaction this would get you out of him. To experiment with this newfound need to have such control over a man.\u00a0</p><p>He growls at the teasing nature of your move and attacks your mouth even more aggressively than before. Hot, wet tongue probing its way into your mouth. </p><p>He tastes like cinnamon and coffee, making you crave him even more. You press yourself into him, meshing your chest to his. </p><p>He works expertly, both your tongues entangling in a dangerous tango.\u00a0</p><p>His fingers thread into your hair and as if communicating to eachother, you both twist your heads to the side, attempting to get better access at each other&rsquo;s mouths. </p><p>You moved sensually against him, your body moving on its own accord as your hips moved on him in circular motions you had no idea you were even capable of. He grunts a little, his hold on you tightening to a bruising point, almost as if having to physically hold back.\u00a0</p><p>You found yourself gasping into his mouth at the fairly new feeling of his hardness pressing against you.</p><p>Your hands slither their way up to his neck as you played with the messy strands of his hair, tugging and pulling on them gently, running your fingers through their silky smoothness. Moving your other hand down his muscled back, your nails scraped at the skin over the thin cotton fabric of his band tee. You had an ever-growing desperation bubbling inside you that needed an outlet to be released.</p><p>Your mind was foggy with want and the pleasure steadily building up in your stomach to worry much about the fact that you were practically dry-humping in the middle of a -vacant- street but nonetheless a street, with your<i> English teacher.\u00a0</i></p><p>All you could focus on was his hands on you, the way he makes the goddamn most animalistic growl you\u2019ve ever head because of <i>your </i>pulling of his hair. You feel powerful and sexy. Thoroughly ready to be fucked into oblivion by this man.</p><p>And he wastes no time in gripping your ass in his big hands and hoisting you up like you weighed nothing. </p><p>You yelp into his mouth, instinctively wrapping your legs around his trim waist and your arms around his broad shoulders before he\u2019s pressing you back against the wall and attacking your lips once more with urgency in his movements.</p><p>He takes your bottom lip into his mouth and sucks on it gently, causing an inexplicable pressure to press on your core. You can help but rasp out a moan, taking his jaw into your hands and licking his tongue with a tiny swipe.</p><p>He suddenly pauses his kissing you and you find yourself completely out of breath, your veins thrumming with an adrenaline rush you\u2019d missed more than anything in the world.\u00a0</p><p>He really was like a drug, that man.\u00a0</p><p>Supporting your weight with the wall, he slowly moves his hands away from your ass, softly caressing your thighs as you dig your heels into his firm ass.</p><p>His eyes are shut and lips brushing against yours so you could feel and taste every uneven, raggedy breath leaving his red swollen lips.</p><p> Then he moves his head down to your neck, soft lips pressing a light kiss to your flushed skin.\u00a0</p><p>You tremble, throwing your head back to give him more access and becoming completely undone with the feeling of his soft lips working into your skin in soft, sensual pecks. He begins peppering these all over your skin. </p><p>\u201cGod, I love your skin. So soft,\u201d he whispers, his hot breath fanning your already-sensitive skin. <br/></p><p>You rake your nails through his hair, biting your lip when you hear him groan lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I love your hair. So soft,\u201d you mock him breathlessly, chuckling softly. </p><p>He looks up at you, breath faltering when he sees you. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking beautiful, have I told you that?\u201d </p><p>You smirk, leaning in and pecking his lips. \u201cOnce or twice.\u201d </p><p>He stares at you a bit longer, lust-filled eyes glimmering beautifully with that softness from before just slightly intensified. You also take this time to admire him in all his after-kiss glory. His even messier hair, his sexy red, swollen lips, his half-hooded hungry eyes. And all of it, all of this, was for you. By you. With you. </p><p><i>He wanted you</i>. And goddamn if you didn\u2019t want him just as bad if not even more. </p><p>Mr. Evans smiles goofily, biting his lip in a failed attempt to conceal it. </p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he mumbles softly after a while of losing yourselves in each others\u2019 gazes.\u00a0</p><p>Almost like it was inevitable to do so. His eyes were gorgeous and you had a slightly frustrating inability to stop staring into them. Though, you wondered what he\u2019d found in yours other than&hellip;<i>bleh</i>.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You pout, whining. \u201cBut <i>why</i>?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, kissing your forehead lightly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re drunk and it would be a complete dick move to take advantage of you while you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>You smirk, leaning in and softly kissing the shell of his ear.\u00a0\u201cWhat if I said I <i>want </i>you to be a dick?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You almost can\u2019t believe you\u2019re acting like this, but Mr. Evans had become addictive as a drug.</p><p>He sighs deeply, fingers digging into your thighs in a warning.</p><p><i>\u2018Don\u2019t poke the bear Y/n.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI would say there\u2019s literally\u00a0<i>nothing </i>I\u2019d like more but than to make you mine right here right now, but that I\u2019m not that kind of man. And that I won\u2019t go further than what just happened because that in and of itself was wrong of me to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sigh, nodding tightly. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He copies your gesture, sighing softly before <i>very </i>slowly putting you on your feet. </p><p>Your legs were still wobbly and you realized maybe this time the alcohol wasn\u2019t to blame for that.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take me home, Mr. Evans,\u201d you say seriously, looking over at him from the passenger seat. <br/></p><p>He raises a brow, shifting uncomfortably in his seat like he\u2019d been doing the past few minutes. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>You chuckle nervously. \u201cUh, my Dad&hellip;kinda doesn\u2019t know I came here&hellip;And if he were to find out&hellip;well, let\u2019s just say \u2018all hell would break loose\u2019 wouldn\u2019t cover it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Evans\u2019s brows rise in shock, basically climbing their way into his hairline. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You mumble. <br/></p><p>Then he breaks out into boisterous laughter. \u201cOh my God. You- you really never cease to amaze me, you know that? Just when I think I got you all figured out&hellip;you go ahead and do shit like this.\u201d He looks at you again, eyes full with a fondness that sent your stomach fluttering and your heart racing. </p><p> You grin, shrugging bashfully at him. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>He catches your hand, squeezing your fingers. \u201cNo, I mean it, sweetheart. You\u2019re fucking incredible.\u201d </p><p>His beautiful eyes are full with sincerity and warmth and just like a moth drawn to a flame, you can\u2019t help but feel yourself inexplicably drawn to him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing too,\u201d you whisper sincerely, cupping his cheek softly. <br/></p><p>The moment is broken by his insistent shifting in his seat. You look pointedly at his crotch area, which still displayed his very prominent, uh- <i>excitement</i>, grinning. </p><p>\u201cYou okay there, Mr. Evans?\u201d <br/></p><p>He clears his throat awkwardly, tugging at the jeans barely-concealing his very obvious boner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop teasing me. This is <i>your </i>damn fault,\u201d he hisses.\u00a0</p><p>You laugh.\u00a0\u201cTell me again why I\u00a0\n\nshould \n\n apologize for merely <i>inspiring </i>such a <i>wonderful </i>reaction in you?\u201d<br/></p><p>He rolls his eyes, unable to fight off a small grin.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019ll go away eventually. Where do I take you then?\u201d</p><p>You groan.\u00a0\u201cA fucking park bench will do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You blush.\u00a0\u201cThe only other person\u2019s house I can go to is Margo, but she\u2019s off somewhere else taking care of her family emergency.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have any other friends you can call up?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sigh, shaking your head embarrassedly.\u00a0\u201cNo. Listen, I\u2019m sorry. I can just go home and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You look at him, shocked.\u00a0\u201c<i>No</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can come to my place.\u201d He offers you a small smile. \n\n\u00a0</p><p>You immediately shake your head \u2018no\u2019. This offer was <i>ridiculous</i>! With everything that just happened, the level that things had reached, how comfortable you are around him now&hellip;it simply wasn\u2019t a wise option to go to his house right now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I couldn\u2019t ask that of you, Mr. Evans! I can deal with an angry father you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Y/n, really. I <i>want </i>to,\u201d he smiles reassuringly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>But then again, your angry father wasn\u2019t something you wanted to deal with right now. At all. Just imagining him when he found out what you\u2019d been doing tonight sent unpleasant shivers up your spine.\u00a0</p><p>You sigh.\u00a0\u201cBut isn\u2019t that too much of a risk? What if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about being seen, sweetheart. I live alone and pretty far from here.\u201d</p><p>You chew on your lip nervously, mulling it over even though deep down you already knew your answer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about me trying anything either. I would never do anything like that while you&rsquo;re drunk or unwilling,\u201d he says sincerely.<br/></p><p>You can\u2019t help but raise a teasing brow, smirking.\u00a0\u201cAnd if I was sober and willing?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles lowly, biting his lip and gazing at you with eyes that said everything you needed to know.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling a small delightful shiver run through you at the thought, you clear your throat, breaking the sexually-tense staring contest and leaning into his soft leather seats.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>The drive to Mr. Evans\u2019s house is silent for the first few minutes. Calm. And you take that time to relish in the emotion of having him close to you. Feeling the comfort of his warmth so near you.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nOf hearing his heart beat in sync with yours. Of his scent wafting into your nose constantly. \n\n<br/></p><p>Everything happened so fast&hellip; you could barely process the fact that <i>he wanted you too.</i> And not only that, but that you neither of you seemed to care that you were his student and he was your teacher and that all of this, everything that had happened and was happening even now, was so, <i>so </i>inappropriate.\u00a0</p><p>Because when you were together, none of it mattered. When it was just you and him, everyone who\u2019d judge you didn\u2019t exist.\u00a0</p><p>You hear him laughing a low, sexy laugh and look over at him with a smile.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his lip quirks up into a tiny smirk, his eyes still set on the road.\u00a0\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just&hellip;remember the last time we were in here together?\u201d</p><p>You suck in a sharp breath at the words, memories of your first kiss flooding back and intensifying, even more, when you remember the kissed that <i>just </i>happened.\u00a0</p><p>The reality of what\u2019d happened- that second kiss. It was unlike any intensity you\u2019d ever felt in your entire life. Even before you even touched lips. You literally felt like if you didn\u2019t kiss him at that exact moment, the very air around you would suffocate you to death.\u00a0</p><p>And feeling him, all of him, pressed up against you like that sent you spiraling into your deepest, darkest fantasies. You wanted him to fuck you on every surface of this car and the throbbing between your legs - the one you\u2019d now had the mere semblance of- came back to you full force, pulsating so hard it forced you to press your thighs together.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mr. Evans\u2019s voice snaps you back to reality and you jump a little.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, uh&hellip;yeah. Yeah! I\u2019m fine.\u201d You clear your throat, trying to calm your racing heart and mind.\u00a0\u201cSo&hellip;how\u2019d you find me either way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky guess.\u201d He shrugs.\u00a0\u201cHeard some students talking about the huge party at Jenna Millers\u2019 tonight and figured it wasn\u2019t a coincidence you were drunk and calling me while in this state on the same day it was happening.\u201d</p><p>You laugh nervously, cheeks heating up as you recall what you said to him on the phone.\u00a0\u201cYeah, sorry\u00a0\u2018bout what I said on the phone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He grins smugly.\u00a0\u201cSorry? Why are you sorry? I for one think it\u2019s the best phone call I\u2019ve probably <i>ever </i>gotten!\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0You roll your eyes, crossing your arms over your chest. \u201cYeah, yeah. <i>Laugh it up</i>&hellip; How much longer \u2018til we get there?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He smiles.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re still a few minutes away, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You hum in acknowledgment.\u00a0\u201cCan I put on some music?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He raises his brows, but smiles and nods nonetheless, motioning to his radio.\u00a0\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You lean over, feeling strangely giddy as you flip through stations.\u00a0</p><p>You gasp excitedly when you hear the initial notes of your favorite song.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love this song!\u201d You turn the volume up and grin over at Mr. Evans who\u2019s seems bewildered as hell by your seemingly random enthusiasm.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI hopped off the plane at LAX<br/>With a dream and my cardigan<br/>Welcome to the land of fame excess,<br/>Whoa, am I gonna fit in?\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>His expression turns to one of realization and then to bemusement as he watches you lower the window. You let the wind pass through your hair with a big smile on your face, enjoying the chilly night on your flushed skin.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nMy tummy&rsquo;s turnin&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; kinda home sick<br/>Too much pressure and I&rsquo;m nervous,<br/>That&rsquo;s when the taxi man turned on the radio<br/>And the Jay Z song was on<br/>And the Jay Z song was on<br/>And the Jay Z song was on\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>You belt out the lyrics with sheer joy coming out of your every pore.\u00a0\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nSo I put my hands up<br/>They&rsquo;re playing my song,<br/>And the butterflies fly away<br/>Noddin&rsquo; my head like, yeah<br/>Movin&rsquo; my hips like, yeah<br/>I got my hands up,<br/>They&rsquo;re playin&rsquo; my song<br/>You know I&rsquo;m gonna be okay<br/>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a party in the USA<br/>Yeah it&rsquo;s a party in the USA\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>When the chorus hits, you have no problem sticking your hand out the window to feel the air rushing in between your fingertips, a\u00a0 Cheshire cat spread wide on your lips.\u00a0</p><p>Mr. Evans laughs loudly at you and you look at him over your shoulder, grinning as you waggle your brows. He laughs louder, turning his eyes back to the road as you continue singing your heart out to\u00a0\u201cParty in the U.S.A.\u201d by Miley Cyrus like your very life depended on it.\u00a0</p><p>The car slows to a stop just as\u00a0the song is ending and you lower the volume of the radio and the window, still grinning from ear to ear.\u00a0</p><p>The house is before you is relatively big. It and the porch painted a thematic white and grey.\u00a0</p><p>Your smile widens impossible more and you turn to Mr. Evans to comment on his house.\u00a0\u201cMr. Evans this house is-<i>mmph!</i>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t get to say anything before his lips are on yours though, his fingers threading into your wind-rustled hair. You immediately respond, cupping his cheeks as he presses a soft and loving kiss to your lips.\u00a0</p><p>When he breaks away, your smile is smaller but softer and loving.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d You whisper breathlessly.\u00a0</p><p>He shrugs, mirroring your smile.\u00a0\u201cFor being so goddamn cute.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And then he\u2019s climbing out of the car, leaving you flushed and bashful and an utter puddle of soft emotions.\u00a0</p><p>You groan into your hands, sinking into the car seat.\u00a0</p><p>How the hell were you supposed to survive even a few hours without jumping this man\u2019s bones?\u00a0</p><p>***</p><h2>Ah, surviving the Evans charm.

You\u2019re full of surprises, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You press your lips to the nape of his neck lightly and mumble gently into the soft skin. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard and you feel his big warm hands lightly shaking on your skin.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re nothing but trouble Ms. Y/l/n,\u201d he practically rasps, his voice strained and husky.</p><p>Uncaring if you\u2019re crossing any lines even by simply being in his presence right now, you laugh softly, pressing closer to his warm chest and letting out a content sigh.</p><p>You break away from him, looking up at his face. \u201cThank you,\u201d you manage to say sincerely through your drunken gaze. \u201cFor saving me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let him touch you like that.\u201d </p><p>You shudder in his arms at the thought of whatever it was that James was planning to do with you. \u201cHe misunderstood my intentions with him. I only danced with him because it seemed like fun a fun thing to do at the time. But that\u2019s all it was. Dancing. And I let him touch me a bit because I thought it was innocent. But then he didn\u2019t want to stop when I told him to.\u201d</p><p>At this, all signs of lust and humor are gone from his face and he halts his brisk walk in the middle of a lonely street.</p><p>You furrow your brows confusedly at him as he sets you down on the ground gently. You hold onto his neck for support as your legs wobble slightly before entirely untangling yourself from him.</p><p>The street is completely pitch black aside from a single streetlight which only illuminates half of both of you. </p><p>\u201cYou can walk on your own from here on out. My car\u2019s only a few blocks away,\u201d he mumbles coldly over his shoulder at you, stalking ahead. </p><p>You raise a brow at his sudden shift in attitude. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d you mumble to yourself, clumsily stumbling on behind him. </p><p>It only takes a few minutes of you consistently cursing your drunkness and heels for your inability to walk properly before Mr. Evans stops walking abruptly, causing you to crash head-first against his strong back. You grunt when your nose gets crushed on his firm muscles.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d You stumble back, rubbing the sore spot frantically in an attempt to massage the ache away. <br></p><p> When you look back up at him, though, you\u2019re shocked to find that he\u2019s taken his sunglasses off, bright blue eyes now glaring holes into you.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you even thinking Y/n? Huh!?\u201d He hisses.</p><p>You blink at him slowly, whiplashing at his sudden change in demeanor. \u201cWha-what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He laughs dryly, jabbing an angry finger directly at you. \u201cOh my- I <i>mean</i> that I literally just had to pry off and beat the living hell out of one of my goddam students <i>for you</i>!\u201d</p><p>You raise an indignant brow at his accusatory tone. Like this was somehow <i>your </i>fucking fault.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s my fault, <i>how </i>exactly?\u201d</p><p>He scoffs. \u201cWell, You came <i>alone </i>to a fucking <i>party,</i> for starters. I mean,\u201d he licks his lips, laughing humorlessly. \u201cWhat girl your age fucking does that!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t! Margo had to leave early for a family emergency,\u201d you quickly defend before quietly adding; \u201cand you didn\u2019t <i>have </i>to beat James up like that.\u201d</p><p>He runs his long fingers through his hair making his hoodie fall off and licks his lips in pure frustration again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have- <i>I didn\u2019t have to beat James up like that!</i>\u201d He laughs darkly mocking your statement before looking down at you incredulously. </p><p>\u201cHe was putting his damn hands on you sweetheart! He was going to drag you off to god-knows-where to-\u201c he instantly cuts himself off, sucking in a sharp breath. His eyes screw shut and his jaw clenches tightly, ticking.</p><p>\u201cShit, just thinking about it makes me wanna go back in there to finish what I started,\u201d he growls so low under his breath that if it wasn\u2019t for the isolation of the place you were in, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear him.</p><p>His eyes turn to you once more, the heat of his anger warming your skin as he slowly moves in, stalking up to you with avid, determined steps. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo <i>yes</i>, I did have to beat him up like that. Because he\u2019s a goddam scum bag who shouldn\u2019t be forcing himself on girls. <i>Especially </i>you!\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s completely red in the face, the veins of his neck prominently protruding from his neck as well as from his forehead. </p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d you pause, frowning in confusion at him. <br></p><p>He freezes as well and for a second, an expression that screamed \u2018oops!\u2019 flashed on his face before being instantly replaced with an exasperated sigh. \u201cWell, yeah. Because you\u2019re\u2026<i>you</i>!\u201d he seems flustered, motioning to you loosely. </p><p>You raise an indignant brow, feeling like he\u2019s somehow secretly insulting you. \u201cWhat\u2019s <i>that </i>supposed to mean?\u201d </p><p>He smirks cynically. \u201cC\u2019 mon, Y/n! Let\u2019s not fool ourselves. That party is not exactly your scene. You\u2019re naive and an innocent sweetheart.\u201d <br></p><p>You can\u2019t help it when your alcohol-infested blood boils at his words which were right but nevertheless presumptuous and arrogant.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I already fucking told you to stop calling me that,\u201d you hiss venomously. \u201cSecondly, I\u2019m <i>not </i>fucking innocent,\u201d you practically scream, balling your fists. \u00a0</p><p>He laughs at you. He fucking <i>laughs </i>at you!\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s making you feel powerless and small and you\u2019re completely in the dark for his reasoning behind this sudden display of assholery. He seemed completely fine just a minute ago, but as soon as you mentioned dancing with James, it\u2019s like a switch just flipped inside of him.</p><p>You shove him back by his strong chest, and as he was completely caught off guard by your tiny hands, he stumbles back slightly, his heels catching him before he completely fell on his ass.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d You point a threatening finger at him, glaring holes into his head. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so fucking upset anyways!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause of <i>you</i>!\u201d He screams so loud, you almost jump out of your skin.\u00a0</p><p>Shocked into silence, you glance up at him, your eyes wide.\u00a0</p><p>You take a moment to look closely at this part of Mr. Evans. The infuriated one. That darkness was back in his eyes, but somehow even darker than before. More untamed and wild. Swirling in his eyes is utter hurt and frustration and he looks even more uncontrolled with his hair all disheveled from his constant running his fingers through the dirty blonde locks. His lips pursed tightly, his nostrils flared and his hands balled into tightly-clenched fists, barely holding back his frustrations. <br></p><p>His eyes were alive with a fire that fueled that darkness further and you\u2019d never felt more attracted to something so aggressive and scary-looking. You wanted the warmth of that fire to envelop you in a tight embrace, to ignite your very being alive with its flames. To make you feel something other than despair and frustration and numbness. \u00a0 </p><p> \u201c<i>You\u2019re </i>the fucking reason I\u2019m so messed up, Y/n! Look at me!\u201d He motions to himself desperately, his voice strained. Then he motions around him, throwing his hands up. \u201cLook where I\u2019m fucking at right now! It\u2019s three in the goddam morning and here I am, in the middle of a fucking street arguing with one of my <i>students </i>about something I shouldn\u2019t even <i>be </i>upset by!\u201d He laughs dryly, furious eyes locking on yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause why should I give a flying fuck if you\u2019re dancing with another guy?! Why the hell should I <i>give a shit </i>if you\u2019re letting him put his grubby hands on you?\u2026\u201d his voice falters towards the end of his sentence, chest heaving.\u00a0</p><p>Leaning on a nearby wall, he runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even be here right now. If somebody, <i>anybody</i>\u00a0in that party recognized me, it could <i>literally </i>ruin my life. What the fuck am I even doing here right now?\u201d he breathes to himself. </p><p>Even with the sudden urge to grab his face and kiss the living hell out of him burning and sizzling slowly in the pit of your gut, you know what he\u2019s trying to say. He\u2019s done so much for you already. Showing up here like that was a huge risk and you were partially at fault for calling him. </p><p>You feel undeniably guilty now. </p><p>It\u2019s quiet for a few seconds, with nothing but your heavy breathing filling in the tense, silent atmosphere all around you before you finally speak up, voice shaky and apologetic.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Mr. Evans? You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry for making you come all the way here.\u201d You smile up at him with a sincere but slightly sad smile as you couldn\u2019t hide that tinge of pain you felt. \u201cAnd thanks for everything. Really. I know it\u2019s far more than you have to do for any of your students. I\u2019ll see you on Monday.\u201d </p><p>And with that, you spin on your heel, decisively walking in the opposite direction of where he\u2019d been taking you. </p><p>You only get as far as a few steps from him before Mr. Evans\u2019s big warm hand is wrapping around your uninjured wrist, halting you mid-step and spinning you back around to face him. </p><p>You frown confusedly. \u201cMr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t <i>understand </i>Y/n,\u201d he whispers huskily, chest still heaving with anger, eyes set heavily on you. \u201cI knew this had the potential to ruin me in an instant and I still came.\u201d <br></p><p>You open your mouth to speak, but he immediately cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realize?\u201d his laugh isn\u2019t mocking or dry this time. It\u2019s strained and tired and defeated. Your heart squeezes painfully in your chest at the sound of it. <br></p><p>\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that you called me. It\u2019s that I <i>still </i>fucking came! Because you\u2019re driving me absolutely insane sweetheart. I can\u2019t fucking sleep or eat or teach or think or do <i>anything </i>without thinking about you. And it\u2019s killing me to see you walk your pretty little ass around school and my class and <i>not </i>think about that kiss and how much I wanna fucking do it again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His gaze flickers to your slightly parted lips and you can feel your heart positively\u00a0<i>hammering </i>at his heated confession, ready to rid itself of any inhibitions you may have about any of this in an instant/\u00a0</p><p>Slowly, eyes half-hooded and set still on your lips, he begins backing you back against the wall behind you, opposite of him. You stumble backward, entirely <i>spellbound </i>by his dark blue eyes.\u00a0</p><p>His steps are slow and deliberate, giving you the chance to leave at any point.\u00a0 He knew you wouldn\u2019t though. He was letting you know that <i>he </i>knew you wouldn\u2019t. Hell, that you <i>couldn\u2019t. </i>Even if you tried.\u00a0</p><p>Along with that, he was making sure to prolong the aching in your core for as long as possible. To intensify the desperate anticipation with which you awaited his lips. His touch. </p><p>You can\u2019t fight him. Both you and he know you don\u2019t <i>want </i>to fight him either. </p><p>A barely-audible gasp leaves your lips when your back meets the cold of a stone wall of some random building. </p><p>He wraps his arms around your hips first, pressing his forehead to yours, brushing his nose on yours softly, teasing. His eyes flutter as he drags his gaze back up to your own heated gaze.</p><p>You could see it in his eyes. He knew this was wrong. He knew the consequences this would eventually bring, but he didn\u2019t <i>care</i>. He yearned for your lips just like you did his.\u00a0</p><p>Gently, he massages his thumbs into the thin, soft fabric of your dress, leaving you breathless and entirely in awe of his power over you. Then his hands, leaving a blazing trail in their wake, make their way up to your waist, squeezing at the skin softly as if to let you know what was happening was real. That you weren\u2019t dreaming any of things he was doing to you right now.\u00a0<br></p><p>That you weren\u2019t making up the requited emotions he felt for you as well.\u00a0</p><p>Goosebumps rose on your skin and that familiar shudder rippled down your spine in a bold reminder that you were his. His to touch, his to kiss, his to keep. You could never feel the way he made you feel with someone else. Someone else\u2019s touch would never ignite the fire in your belly like his did. Not even <i>close</i>. </p><p>\u201cMr.-\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have fucking called me, Y/n,\u201d he hums huskily against your lips.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>You exhale shakily into his mouth, your breaths mingling, your very being trembling in delight. Unable to say anything, you just look at him desperately,</p><p>His hands make their torturously delicious way up to your neck where he trails a single finger to your shoulders and nape back and forth gently. You sigh in relief, eyes closing in pure ecstasy. </p><p>Finally, his fingers wrap around your cheek and chin, lifting your gaze to properly meet his.\u00a0</p><p>Your heart is racing in your chest so fast, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s going to fall out any second now.\u00a0</p><p>His eyes are dark with anger and lust and frustration, but they\u2019re also lighted with something soft and caring. Something you were almost completely convinced resembled <i>love</i>. </p><p>You wanted to drown in his touch. His fragrance obscuring all your senses, putting the vodka you\u2019d consumed earlier to shame. It made you feel more intoxicated than the alcohol ever did. Though, instead of numbing you down, it only intensified that painful yearning in your chest and that aggressive throbbing in your core.\u00a0</p><p>Nothing ever hurt better than being in his arms. </p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i>,\u201d you strain, pushing against the huge lump in your throat. \u201cWe have to stop Mr. Evans.\u201d Your voice is weak, making it clear to him and yourself that you didn\u2019t, in fact, want to \u2018stop\u2019. <br></p><p><i>God</i>, no. </p><p>But you had to make an effort to stop this from happening at least. It was wrong. You both knew it and somehow\u2026you didn\u2019t care. </p><p>\u201cI know sweetheart. I know. But I don\u2019t think I can hold back anymore. I just want to\u2026\u201d his gaze flickers right back to your lips and he groans under his breath. \u201cJesus fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re left breathing against his mouth in raggedy breaths, eyes flickering between his lips and his eyes, admiring the sharp and chiseled edges of his face along the way. The dimmed light of the abandoned street illuminated his face enough so you could admire the keen shape of his jaw, the angular slope of his nose and the soft curves and dips of his plump pink lips. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to run around looking this fucking ravishing and expect me to be able to resist you,\u201d he all but growls into you. \u201cYou don\u2019t even fucking know what you do to me, do you?\u201d <br></p><p>Then he presses his entire body to yours. Your chests and lower halves now hugged the one to the other, you can feel just how much you\u2019ve affected him and it leaves you spent, that throbbing in your core intensifying by a thousand. Your gut flips in you and a flush of heat spreads through you like wildfire.</p><p> As your heated gazes flare-up in unison, both knowing of what was coming next, you know there\u2019s no going back. </p><p>\u201cI want you to kiss me, Mr. Evans.\u201d \u00a0Your voice is needy and desperate but you can\u2019t find it in you to give a single damn.</p><p>And that\u2019s all it takes for the dam to break. In the blink of an eye, Mr. Evans is crashing his lips against yours, <i>hard</i>.\u00a0</p><p>You suck in a sharp breath as soon as you feel his soft lips make contact with yours. Your chest burned intensely as his wet mouth wrapped around yours harshly, his hands cupping your jaw and roughly tugging you closer to him.\u00a0</p><p>This kiss is in sharp contrast to your first one, is the first thing you notice. This kiss is rugged and demanding and filled with want much more than the need to comfort eachother.\n\n<br></p><p>You were both filled up with a desire and need for eachother that was bottomless. And selfish. \n\n</p><p>Merely wanting to feel him as close to you as possible, you snake your arms around his neck and draw him closer.\u00a0</p><p>Your stomach clenches as you feverishly claimed each other\u2019s mouths. </p><p>\n\n Even with the tempo of the kiss set so high thanks to the wanton yearning finally being released within you, you still moved in sync with each other.\n\nHis lips and yours worked together like they were always meant to do so, the delightful feeling of his scruff rubbing against your skin sending another wave of pleasant shivers through your body.\u00a0</p><p>His soft lips controlled yours with so much passion and unfulfilled want that it almost made your legs give out beneath him. His hold on your waist was almost possessive as he pressed you harder against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>Your mouth acted upon its own free will, tugging his bottom lip in between your teeth and biting it slowly. You wanted to gauge for what reaction this would get you out of him. To experiment with this newfound need to have such control over a man.\u00a0</p><p>He growls at the teasing nature of your move and attacks your mouth even more aggressively than before. Hot, wet tongue probing its way into your mouth. </p><p>He tastes like cinnamon and coffee, making you crave him even more. You press yourself into him, meshing your chest to his. </p><p>He works expertly, both your tongues entangling in a dangerous tango.\u00a0</p><p>His fingers thread into your hair and as if communicating to eachother, you both twist your heads to the side, attempting to get better access at each other\u2019s mouths. </p><p>You moved sensually against him, your body moving on its own accord as your hips moved on him in circular motions you had no idea you were even capable of. He grunts a little, his hold on you tightening to a bruising point, almost as if having to physically hold back.\u00a0</p><p>You found yourself gasping into his mouth at the fairly new feeling of his hardness pressing against you.</p><p>Your hands slither their way up to his neck as you played with the messy strands of his hair, tugging and pulling on them gently, running your fingers through their silky smoothness. Moving your other hand down his muscled back, your nails scraped at the skin over the thin cotton fabric of his band tee. You had an ever-growing desperation bubbling inside you that needed an outlet to be released.</p><p>Your mind was foggy with want and the pleasure steadily building up in your stomach to worry much about the fact that you were practically dry-humping in the middle of a -vacant- street but nonetheless a street, with your<i> English teacher.\u00a0</i></p><p>All you could focus on was his hands on you, the way he makes the goddamn most animalistic growl you\u2019ve ever head because of <i>your </i>pulling of his hair. You feel powerful and sexy. Thoroughly ready to be fucked into oblivion by this man.</p><p>And he wastes no time in gripping your ass in his big hands and hoisting you up like you weighed nothing. </p><p>You yelp into his mouth, instinctively wrapping your legs around his trim waist and your arms around his broad shoulders before he\u2019s pressing you back against the wall and attacking your lips once more with urgency in his movements.</p><p>He takes your bottom lip into his mouth and sucks on it gently, causing an inexplicable pressure to press on your core. You can help but rasp out a moan, taking his jaw into your hands and licking his tongue with a tiny swipe.</p><p>He suddenly pauses his kissing you and you find yourself completely out of breath, your veins thrumming with an adrenaline rush you\u2019d missed more than anything in the world.\u00a0</p><p>He really was like a drug, that man.\u00a0</p><p>Supporting your weight with the wall, he slowly moves his hands away from your ass, softly caressing your thighs as you dig your heels into his firm ass.</p><p>His eyes are shut and lips brushing against yours so you could feel and taste every uneven, raggedy breath leaving his red swollen lips.</p><p> Then he moves his head down to your neck, soft lips pressing a light kiss to your flushed skin.\u00a0</p><p>You tremble, throwing your head back to give him more access and becoming completely undone with the feeling of his soft lips working into your skin in soft, sensual pecks. He begins peppering these all over your skin. </p><p>\u201cGod, I love your skin. So soft,\u201d he whispers, his hot breath fanning your already-sensitive skin. <br></p><p>You rake your nails through his hair, biting your lip when you hear him groan lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I love your hair. So soft,\u201d you mock him breathlessly, chuckling softly. </p><p>He looks up at you, breath faltering when he sees you. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking beautiful, have I told you that?\u201d </p><p>You smirk, leaning in and pecking his lips. \u201cOnce or twice.\u201d </p><p>He stares at you a bit longer, lust-filled eyes glimmering beautifully with that softness from before just slightly intensified. You also take this time to admire him in all his after-kiss glory. His even messier hair, his sexy red, swollen lips, his half-hooded hungry eyes. And all of it, all of this, was for you. By you. With you. </p><p><i>He wanted you</i>. And goddamn if you didn\u2019t want him just as bad if not even more. </p><p>Mr. Evans smiles goofily, biting his lip in a failed attempt to conceal it. </p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he mumbles softly after a while of losing yourselves in each others\u2019 gazes.\u00a0</p><p>Almost like it was inevitable to do so. His eyes were gorgeous and you had a slightly frustrating inability to stop staring into them. Though, you wondered what he\u2019d found in yours other than\u2026<i>bleh</i>.\u00a0<br></p><p>You pout, whining. \u201cBut <i>why</i>?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, kissing your forehead lightly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re drunk and it would be a complete dick move to take advantage of you while you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>You smirk, leaning in and softly kissing the shell of his ear.\u00a0\u201cWhat if I said I <i>want </i>you to be a dick?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You almost can\u2019t believe you\u2019re acting like this, but Mr. Evans had become addictive as a drug.</p><p>He sighs deeply, fingers digging into your thighs in a warning.</p><p><i>\u2018Don\u2019t poke the bear Y/n.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI would say there\u2019s literally\u00a0<i>nothing </i>I\u2019d like more but than to make you mine right here right now, but that I\u2019m not that kind of man. And that I won\u2019t go further than what just happened because that in and of itself was wrong of me to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sigh, nodding tightly. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He copies your gesture, sighing softly before <i>very </i>slowly putting you on your feet. </p><p>Your legs were still wobbly and you realized maybe this time the alcohol wasn\u2019t to blame for that.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take me home, Mr. Evans,\u201d you say seriously, looking over at him from the passenger seat. <br></p><p>He raises a brow, shifting uncomfortably in his seat like he\u2019d been doing the past few minutes. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>You chuckle nervously. \u201cUh, my Dad\u2026kinda doesn\u2019t know I came here\u2026And if he were to find out\u2026well, let\u2019s just say \u2018all hell would break loose\u2019 wouldn\u2019t cover it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Evans\u2019s brows rise in shock, basically climbing their way into his hairline. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You mumble. <br></p><p>Then he breaks out into boisterous laughter. \u201cOh my God. You- you really never cease to amaze me, you know that? Just when I think I got you all figured out\u2026you go ahead and do shit like this.\u201d He looks at you again, eyes full with a fondness that sent your stomach fluttering and your heart racing. </p><p> You grin, shrugging bashfully at him. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>He catches your hand, squeezing your fingers. \u201cNo, I mean it, sweetheart. You\u2019re fucking incredible.\u201d </p><p>His beautiful eyes are full with sincerity and warmth and just like a moth drawn to a flame, you can\u2019t help but feel yourself inexplicably drawn to him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing too,\u201d you whisper sincerely, cupping his cheek softly. <br></p><p>The moment is broken by his insistent shifting in his seat. You look pointedly at his crotch area, which still displayed his very prominent, uh- <i>excitement</i>, grinning. </p><p>\u201cYou okay there, Mr. Evans?\u201d <br></p><p>He clears his throat awkwardly, tugging at the jeans barely-concealing his very obvious boner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop teasing me. This is <i>your </i>damn fault,\u201d he hisses.\u00a0</p><p>You laugh.\u00a0\u201cTell me again why I\u00a0\n\nshould \n\n apologize for merely <i>inspiring </i>such a <i>wonderful </i>reaction in you?\u201d<br></p><p>He rolls his eyes, unable to fight off a small grin.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019ll go away eventually. Where do I take you then?\u201d</p><p>You groan.\u00a0\u201cA fucking park bench will do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You blush.\u00a0\u201cThe only other person\u2019s house I can go to is Margo, but she\u2019s off somewhere else taking care of her family emergency.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have any other friends you can call up?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sigh, shaking your head embarrassedly.\u00a0\u201cNo. Listen, I\u2019m sorry. I can just go home and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You look at him, shocked.\u00a0\u201c<i>No</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can come to my place.\u201d He offers you a small smile. \n\n\u00a0</p><p>You immediately shake your head \u2018no\u2019. This offer was <i>ridiculous</i>! With everything that just happened, the level that things had reached, how comfortable you are around him now\u2026it simply wasn\u2019t a wise option to go to his house right now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I couldn\u2019t ask that of you, Mr. Evans! I can deal with an angry father you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Y/n, really. I <i>want </i>to,\u201d he smiles reassuringly.\u00a0<br></p><p>But then again, your angry father wasn\u2019t something you wanted to deal with right now. At all. Just imagining him when he found out what you\u2019d been doing tonight sent unpleasant shivers up your spine.\u00a0</p><p>You sigh.\u00a0\u201cBut isn\u2019t that too much of a risk? What if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about being seen, sweetheart. I live alone and pretty far from here.\u201d</p><p>You chew on your lip nervously, mulling it over even though deep down you already knew your answer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about me trying anything either. I would never do anything like that while you\u2019re drunk or unwilling,\u201d he says sincerely.<br></p><p>You can\u2019t help but raise a teasing brow, smirking.\u00a0\u201cAnd if I was sober and willing?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles lowly, biting his lip and gazing at you with eyes that said everything you needed to know.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling a small delightful shiver run through you at the thought, you clear your throat, breaking the sexually-tense staring contest and leaning into his soft leather seats.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>The drive to Mr. Evans\u2019s house is silent for the first few minutes. Calm. And you take that time to relish in the emotion of having him close to you. Feeling the comfort of his warmth so near you.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nOf hearing his heart beat in sync with yours. Of his scent wafting into your nose constantly. \n\n<br></p><p>Everything happened so fast\u2026 you could barely process the fact that <i>he wanted you too.</i> And not only that, but that you neither of you seemed to care that you were his student and he was your teacher and that all of this, everything that had happened and was happening even now, was so, <i>so </i>inappropriate.\u00a0</p><p>Because when you were together, none of it mattered. When it was just you and him, everyone who\u2019d judge you didn\u2019t exist.\u00a0</p><p>You hear him laughing a low, sexy laugh and look over at him with a smile.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his lip quirks up into a tiny smirk, his eyes still set on the road.\u00a0\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just\u2026remember the last time we were in here together?\u201d</p><p>You suck in a sharp breath at the words, memories of your first kiss flooding back and intensifying, even more, when you remember the kissed that <i>just </i>happened.\u00a0</p><p>The reality of what\u2019d happened- that second kiss. It was unlike any intensity you\u2019d ever felt in your entire life. Even before you even touched lips. You literally felt like if you didn\u2019t kiss him at that exact moment, the very air around you would suffocate you to death.\u00a0</p><p>And feeling him, all of him, pressed up against you like that sent you spiraling into your deepest, darkest fantasies. You wanted him to fuck you on every surface of this car and the throbbing between your legs - the one you\u2019d now had the mere semblance of- came back to you full force, pulsating so hard it forced you to press your thighs together.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mr. Evans\u2019s voice snaps you back to reality and you jump a little.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, uh\u2026yeah. Yeah! I\u2019m fine.\u201d You clear your throat, trying to calm your racing heart and mind.\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026how\u2019d you find me either way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky guess.\u201d He shrugs.\u00a0\u201cHeard some students talking about the huge party at Jenna Millers\u2019 tonight and figured it wasn\u2019t a coincidence you were drunk and calling me while in this state on the same day it was happening.\u201d</p><p>You laugh nervously, cheeks heating up as you recall what you said to him on the phone.\u00a0\u201cYeah, sorry\u00a0\u2018bout what I said on the phone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He grins smugly.\u00a0\u201cSorry? Why are you sorry? I for one think it\u2019s the best phone call I\u2019ve probably <i>ever </i>gotten!\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0You roll your eyes, crossing your arms over your chest. \u201cYeah, yeah. <i>Laugh it up</i>\u2026 How much longer \u2018til we get there?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He smiles.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re still a few minutes away, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You hum in acknowledgment.\u00a0\u201cCan I put on some music?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He raises his brows, but smiles and nods nonetheless, motioning to his radio.\u00a0\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You lean over, feeling strangely giddy as you flip through stations.\u00a0</p><p>You gasp excitedly when you hear the initial notes of your favorite song.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love this song!\u201d You turn the volume up and grin over at Mr. Evans who\u2019s seems bewildered as hell by your seemingly random enthusiasm.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI hopped off the plane at LAX<br>With a dream and my cardigan<br>Welcome to the land of fame excess,<br>Whoa, am I gonna fit in?\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>His expression turns to one of realization and then to bemusement as he watches you lower the window. You let the wind pass through your hair with a big smile on your face, enjoying the chilly night on your flushed skin.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nMy tummy\u2019s turnin\u2019 and I\u2019m feelin\u2019 kinda home sick<br>Too much pressure and I\u2019m nervous,<br>That\u2019s when the taxi man turned on the radio<br>And the Jay Z song was on<br>And the Jay Z song was on<br>And the Jay Z song was on\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>You belt out the lyrics with sheer joy coming out of your every pore.\u00a0\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nSo I put my hands up<br>They\u2019re playing my song,<br>And the butterflies fly away<br>Noddin\u2019 my head like, yeah<br>Movin\u2019 my hips like, yeah<br>I got my hands up,<br>They\u2019re playin\u2019 my song<br>You know I\u2019m gonna be okay<br>Yeah, it\u2019s a party in the USA<br>Yeah it\u2019s a party in the USA\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>When the chorus hits, you have no problem sticking your hand out the window to feel the air rushing in between your fingertips, a\u00a0 Cheshire cat spread wide on your lips.\u00a0</p><p>Mr. Evans laughs loudly at you and you look at him over your shoulder, grinning as you waggle your brows. He laughs louder, turning his eyes back to the road as you continue singing your heart out to\u00a0\u201cParty in the U.S.A.\u201d by Miley Cyrus like your very life depended on it.\u00a0</p><p>The car slows to a stop just as\u00a0the song is ending and you lower the volume of the radio and the window, still grinning from ear to ear.\u00a0</p><p>The house is before you is relatively big. It and the porch painted a thematic white and grey.\u00a0</p><p>Your smile widens impossible more and you turn to Mr. Evans to comment on his house.\u00a0\u201cMr. Evans this house is-<i>mmph!</i>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t get to say anything before his lips are on yours though, his fingers threading into your wind-rustled hair. You immediately respond, cupping his cheeks as he presses a soft and loving kiss to your lips.\u00a0</p><p>When he breaks away, your smile is smaller but softer and loving.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d You whisper breathlessly.\u00a0</p><p>He shrugs, mirroring your smile.\u00a0\u201cFor being so goddamn cute.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And then he\u2019s climbing out of the car, leaving you flushed and bashful and an utter puddle of soft emotions.\u00a0</p><p>You groan into your hands, sinking into the car seat.\u00a0</p><p>How the hell were you supposed to survive even a few hours without jumping this man\u2019s bones?\u00a0</p><p>***</p><h2>Ah, surviving the Evans charm.

You\u2019re full of surprises, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You press your lips to the nape of his neck lightly and mumble gently into the soft skin. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard and you feel his big warm hands lightly shaking on your skin.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re nothing but trouble Ms. Y/l/n,\u201d he practically rasps, his voice strained and husky.</p><p>Uncaring if you\u2019re crossing any lines even by simply being in his presence right now, you laugh softly, pressing closer to his warm chest and letting out a content sigh.</p><p>You break away from him, looking up at his face. \u201cThank you,\u201d you manage to say sincerely through your drunken gaze. \u201cFor saving me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let him touch you like that.\u201d </p><p>You shudder in his arms at the thought of whatever it was that James was planning to do with you. \u201cHe misunderstood my intentions with him. I only danced with him because it seemed like fun a fun thing to do at the time. But that\u2019s all it was. Dancing. And I let him touch me a bit because I thought it was innocent. But then he didn\u2019t want to stop when I told him to.\u201d</p><p>At this, all signs of lust and humor are gone from his face and he halts his brisk walk in the middle of a lonely street.</p><p>You furrow your brows confusedly at him as he sets you down on the ground gently. You hold onto his neck for support as your legs wobble slightly before entirely untangling yourself from him.</p><p>The street is completely pitch black aside from a single streetlight which only illuminates half of both of you. </p><p>\u201cYou can walk on your own from here on out. My car\u2019s only a few blocks away,\u201d he mumbles coldly over his shoulder at you, stalking ahead. </p><p>You raise a brow at his sudden shift in attitude. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d you mumble to yourself, clumsily stumbling on behind him. </p><p>It only takes a few minutes of you consistently cursing your drunkness and heels for your inability to walk properly before Mr. Evans stops walking abruptly, causing you to crash head-first against his strong back. You grunt when your nose gets crushed on his firm muscles.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d You stumble back, rubbing the sore spot frantically in an attempt to massage the ache away. <br></p><p> When you look back up at him, though, you\u2019re shocked to find that he\u2019s taken his sunglasses off, bright blue eyes now glaring holes into you.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you even thinking Y/n? Huh!?\u201d He hisses.</p><p>You blink at him slowly, whiplashing at his sudden change in demeanor. \u201cWha-what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He laughs dryly, jabbing an angry finger directly at you. \u201cOh my- I <i>mean</i> that I literally just had to pry off and beat the living hell out of one of my goddam students <i>for you</i>!\u201d</p><p>You raise an indignant brow at his accusatory tone. Like this was somehow <i>your </i>fucking fault.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s my fault, <i>how </i>exactly?\u201d</p><p>He scoffs. \u201cWell, You came <i>alone </i>to a fucking <i>party,</i> for starters. I mean,\u201d he licks his lips, laughing humorlessly. \u201cWhat girl your age fucking does that!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t! Margo had to leave early for a family emergency,\u201d you quickly defend before quietly adding; \u201cand you didn\u2019t <i>have </i>to beat James up like that.\u201d</p><p>He runs his long fingers through his hair making his hoodie fall off and licks his lips in pure frustration again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have- <i>I didn\u2019t have to beat James up like that!</i>\u201d He laughs darkly mocking your statement before looking down at you incredulously. </p><p>\u201cHe was putting his damn hands on you sweetheart! He was going to drag you off to god-knows-where to-\u201c he instantly cuts himself off, sucking in a sharp breath. His eyes screw shut and his jaw clenches tightly, ticking.</p><p>\u201cShit, just thinking about it makes me wanna go back in there to finish what I started,\u201d he growls so low under his breath that if it wasn\u2019t for the isolation of the place you were in, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear him.</p><p>His eyes turn to you once more, the heat of his anger warming your skin as he slowly moves in, stalking up to you with avid, determined steps. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo <i>yes</i>, I did have to beat him up like that. Because he\u2019s a goddam scum bag who shouldn\u2019t be forcing himself on girls. <i>Especially </i>you!\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s completely red in the face, the veins of his neck prominently protruding from his neck as well as from his forehead. </p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d you pause, frowning in confusion at him. <br></p><p>He freezes as well and for a second, an expression that screamed \u2018oops!\u2019 flashed on his face before being instantly replaced with an exasperated sigh. \u201cWell, yeah. Because you\u2019re\u2026<i>you</i>!\u201d he seems flustered, motioning to you loosely. </p><p>You raise an indignant brow, feeling like he\u2019s somehow secretly insulting you. \u201cWhat\u2019s <i>that </i>supposed to mean?\u201d </p><p>He smirks cynically. \u201cC\u2019 mon, Y/n! Let\u2019s not fool ourselves. That party is not exactly your scene. You\u2019re naive and an innocent sweetheart.\u201d <br></p><p>You can\u2019t help it when your alcohol-infested blood boils at his words which were right but nevertheless presumptuous and arrogant.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I already fucking told you to stop calling me that,\u201d you hiss venomously. \u201cSecondly, I\u2019m <i>not </i>fucking innocent,\u201d you practically scream, balling your fists. \u00a0</p><p>He laughs at you. He fucking <i>laughs </i>at you!\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s making you feel powerless and small and you\u2019re completely in the dark for his reasoning behind this sudden display of assholery. He seemed completely fine just a minute ago, but as soon as you mentioned dancing with James, it\u2019s like a switch just flipped inside of him.</p><p>You shove him back by his strong chest, and as he was completely caught off guard by your tiny hands, he stumbles back slightly, his heels catching him before he completely fell on his ass.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d You point a threatening finger at him, glaring holes into his head. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so fucking upset anyways!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause of <i>you</i>!\u201d He screams so loud, you almost jump out of your skin.\u00a0</p><p>Shocked into silence, you glance up at him, your eyes wide.\u00a0</p><p>You take a moment to look closely at this part of Mr. Evans. The infuriated one. That darkness was back in his eyes, but somehow even darker than before. More untamed and wild. Swirling in his eyes is utter hurt and frustration and he looks even more uncontrolled with his hair all disheveled from his constant running his fingers through the dirty blonde locks. His lips pursed tightly, his nostrils flared and his hands balled into tightly-clenched fists, barely holding back his frustrations. <br></p><p>His eyes were alive with a fire that fueled that darkness further and you\u2019d never felt more attracted to something so aggressive and scary-looking. You wanted the warmth of that fire to envelop you in a tight embrace, to ignite your very being alive with its flames. To make you feel something other than despair and frustration and numbness. \u00a0 </p><p> \u201c<i>You\u2019re </i>the fucking reason I\u2019m so messed up, Y/n! Look at me!\u201d He motions to himself desperately, his voice strained. Then he motions around him, throwing his hands up. \u201cLook where I\u2019m fucking at right now! It\u2019s three in the goddam morning and here I am, in the middle of a fucking street arguing with one of my <i>students </i>about something I shouldn\u2019t even <i>be </i>upset by!\u201d He laughs dryly, furious eyes locking on yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause why should I give a flying fuck if you\u2019re dancing with another guy?! Why the hell should I <i>give a shit </i>if you\u2019re letting him put his grubby hands on you?\u2026\u201d his voice falters towards the end of his sentence, chest heaving.\u00a0</p><p>Leaning on a nearby wall, he runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even be here right now. If somebody, <i>anybody</i>\u00a0in that party recognized me, it could <i>literally </i>ruin my life. What the fuck am I even doing here right now?\u201d he breathes to himself. </p><p>Even with the sudden urge to grab his face and kiss the living hell out of him burning and sizzling slowly in the pit of your gut, you know what he\u2019s trying to say. He\u2019s done so much for you already. Showing up here like that was a huge risk and you were partially at fault for calling him. </p><p>You feel undeniably guilty now. </p><p>It\u2019s quiet for a few seconds, with nothing but your heavy breathing filling in the tense, silent atmosphere all around you before you finally speak up, voice shaky and apologetic.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Mr. Evans? You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry for making you come all the way here.\u201d You smile up at him with a sincere but slightly sad smile as you couldn\u2019t hide that tinge of pain you felt. \u201cAnd thanks for everything. Really. I know it\u2019s far more than you have to do for any of your students. I\u2019ll see you on Monday.\u201d </p><p>And with that, you spin on your heel, decisively walking in the opposite direction of where he\u2019d been taking you. </p><p>You only get as far as a few steps from him before Mr. Evans\u2019s big warm hand is wrapping around your uninjured wrist, halting you mid-step and spinning you back around to face him. </p><p>You frown confusedly. \u201cMr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t <i>understand </i>Y/n,\u201d he whispers huskily, chest still heaving with anger, eyes set heavily on you. \u201cI knew this had the potential to ruin me in an instant and I still came.\u201d <br></p><p>You open your mouth to speak, but he immediately cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realize?\u201d his laugh isn\u2019t mocking or dry this time. It\u2019s strained and tired and defeated. Your heart squeezes painfully in your chest at the sound of it. <br></p><p>\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that you called me. It\u2019s that I <i>still </i>fucking came! Because you\u2019re driving me absolutely insane sweetheart. I can\u2019t fucking sleep or eat or teach or think or do <i>anything </i>without thinking about you. And it\u2019s killing me to see you walk your pretty little ass around school and my class and <i>not </i>think about that kiss and how much I wanna fucking do it again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His gaze flickers to your slightly parted lips and you can feel your heart positively\u00a0<i>hammering </i>at his heated confession, ready to rid itself of any inhibitions you may have about any of this in an instant/\u00a0</p><p>Slowly, eyes half-hooded and set still on your lips, he begins backing you back against the wall behind you, opposite of him. You stumble backward, entirely <i>spellbound </i>by his dark blue eyes.\u00a0</p><p>His steps are slow and deliberate, giving you the chance to leave at any point.\u00a0 He knew you wouldn\u2019t though. He was letting you know that <i>he </i>knew you wouldn\u2019t. Hell, that you <i>couldn\u2019t. </i>Even if you tried.\u00a0</p><p>Along with that, he was making sure to prolong the aching in your core for as long as possible. To intensify the desperate anticipation with which you awaited his lips. His touch. </p><p>You can\u2019t fight him. Both you and he know you don\u2019t <i>want </i>to fight him either. </p><p>A barely-audible gasp leaves your lips when your back meets the cold of a stone wall of some random building. </p><p>He wraps his arms around your hips first, pressing his forehead to yours, brushing his nose on yours softly, teasing. His eyes flutter as he drags his gaze back up to your own heated gaze.</p><p>You could see it in his eyes. He knew this was wrong. He knew the consequences this would eventually bring, but he didn\u2019t <i>care</i>. He yearned for your lips just like you did his.\u00a0</p><p>Gently, he massages his thumbs into the thin, soft fabric of your dress, leaving you breathless and entirely in awe of his power over you. Then his hands, leaving a blazing trail in their wake, make their way up to your waist, squeezing at the skin softly as if to let you know what was happening was real. That you weren\u2019t dreaming any of things he was doing to you right now.\u00a0<br></p><p>That you weren\u2019t making up the requited emotions he felt for you as well.\u00a0</p><p>Goosebumps rose on your skin and that familiar shudder rippled down your spine in a bold reminder that you were his. His to touch, his to kiss, his to keep. You could never feel the way he made you feel with someone else. Someone else\u2019s touch would never ignite the fire in your belly like his did. Not even <i>close</i>. </p><p>\u201cMr.-\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have fucking called me, Y/n,\u201d he hums huskily against your lips.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>You exhale shakily into his mouth, your breaths mingling, your very being trembling in delight. Unable to say anything, you just look at him desperately,</p><p>His hands make their torturously delicious way up to your neck where he trails a single finger to your shoulders and nape back and forth gently. You sigh in relief, eyes closing in pure ecstasy. </p><p>Finally, his fingers wrap around your cheek and chin, lifting your gaze to properly meet his.\u00a0</p><p>Your heart is racing in your chest so fast, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s going to fall out any second now.\u00a0</p><p>His eyes are dark with anger and lust and frustration, but they\u2019re also lighted with something soft and caring. Something you were almost completely convinced resembled <i>love</i>. </p><p>You wanted to drown in his touch. His fragrance obscuring all your senses, putting the vodka you\u2019d consumed earlier to shame. It made you feel more intoxicated than the alcohol ever did. Though, instead of numbing you down, it only intensified that painful yearning in your chest and that aggressive throbbing in your core.\u00a0</p><p>Nothing ever hurt better than being in his arms. </p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i>,\u201d you strain, pushing against the huge lump in your throat. \u201cWe have to stop Mr. Evans.\u201d Your voice is weak, making it clear to him and yourself that you didn\u2019t, in fact, want to \u2018stop\u2019. <br></p><p><i>God</i>, no. </p><p>But you had to make an effort to stop this from happening at least. It was wrong. You both knew it and somehow\u2026you didn\u2019t care. </p><p>\u201cI know sweetheart. I know. But I don\u2019t think I can hold back anymore. I just want to\u2026\u201d his gaze flickers right back to your lips and he groans under his breath. \u201cJesus fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re left breathing against his mouth in raggedy breaths, eyes flickering between his lips and his eyes, admiring the sharp and chiseled edges of his face along the way. The dimmed light of the abandoned street illuminated his face enough so you could admire the keen shape of his jaw, the angular slope of his nose and the soft curves and dips of his plump pink lips. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to run around looking this fucking ravishing and expect me to be able to resist you,\u201d he all but growls into you. \u201cYou don\u2019t even fucking know what you do to me, do you?\u201d <br></p><p>Then he presses his entire body to yours. Your chests and lower halves now hugged the one to the other, you can feel just how much you\u2019ve affected him and it leaves you spent, that throbbing in your core intensifying by a thousand. Your gut flips in you and a flush of heat spreads through you like wildfire.</p><p> As your heated gazes flare-up in unison, both knowing of what was coming next, you know there\u2019s no going back. </p><p>\u201cI want you to kiss me, Mr. Evans.\u201d \u00a0Your voice is needy and desperate but you can\u2019t find it in you to give a single damn.</p><p>And that\u2019s all it takes for the dam to break. In the blink of an eye, Mr. Evans is crashing his lips against yours, <i>hard</i>.\u00a0</p><p>You suck in a sharp breath as soon as you feel his soft lips make contact with yours. Your chest burned intensely as his wet mouth wrapped around yours harshly, his hands cupping your jaw and roughly tugging you closer to him.\u00a0</p><p>This kiss is in sharp contrast to your first one, is the first thing you notice. This kiss is rugged and demanding and filled with want much more than the need to comfort eachother.\n\n<br></p><p>You were both filled up with a desire and need for eachother that was bottomless. And selfish. \n\n</p><p>Merely wanting to feel him as close to you as possible, you snake your arms around his neck and draw him closer.\u00a0</p><p>Your stomach clenches as you feverishly claimed each other\u2019s mouths. </p><p>\n\n Even with the tempo of the kiss set so high thanks to the wanton yearning finally being released within you, you still moved in sync with each other.\n\nHis lips and yours worked together like they were always meant to do so, the delightful feeling of his scruff rubbing against your skin sending another wave of pleasant shivers through your body.\u00a0</p><p>His soft lips controlled yours with so much passion and unfulfilled want that it almost made your legs give out beneath him. His hold on your waist was almost possessive as he pressed you harder against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>Your mouth acted upon its own free will, tugging his bottom lip in between your teeth and biting it slowly. You wanted to gauge for what reaction this would get you out of him. To experiment with this newfound need to have such control over a man.\u00a0</p><p>He growls at the teasing nature of your move and attacks your mouth even more aggressively than before. Hot, wet tongue probing its way into your mouth. </p><p>He tastes like cinnamon and coffee, making you crave him even more. You press yourself into him, meshing your chest to his. </p><p>He works expertly, both your tongues entangling in a dangerous tango.\u00a0</p><p>His fingers thread into your hair and as if communicating to eachother, you both twist your heads to the side, attempting to get better access at each other\u2019s mouths. </p><p>You moved sensually against him, your body moving on its own accord as your hips moved on him in circular motions you had no idea you were even capable of. He grunts a little, his hold on you tightening to a bruising point, almost as if having to physically hold back.\u00a0</p><p>You found yourself gasping into his mouth at the fairly new feeling of his hardness pressing against you.</p><p>Your hands slither their way up to his neck as you played with the messy strands of his hair, tugging and pulling on them gently, running your fingers through their silky smoothness. Moving your other hand down his muscled back, your nails scraped at the skin over the thin cotton fabric of his band tee. You had an ever-growing desperation bubbling inside you that needed an outlet to be released.</p><p>Your mind was foggy with want and the pleasure steadily building up in your stomach to worry much about the fact that you were practically dry-humping in the middle of a -vacant- street but nonetheless a street, with your<i> English teacher.\u00a0</i></p><p>All you could focus on was his hands on you, the way he makes the goddamn most animalistic growl you\u2019ve ever head because of <i>your </i>pulling of his hair. You feel powerful and sexy. Thoroughly ready to be fucked into oblivion by this man.</p><p>And he wastes no time in gripping your ass in his big hands and hoisting you up like you weighed nothing. </p><p>You yelp into his mouth, instinctively wrapping your legs around his trim waist and your arms around his broad shoulders before he\u2019s pressing you back against the wall and attacking your lips once more with urgency in his movements.</p><p>He takes your bottom lip into his mouth and sucks on it gently, causing an inexplicable pressure to press on your core. You can help but rasp out a moan, taking his jaw into your hands and licking his tongue with a tiny swipe.</p><p>He suddenly pauses his kissing you and you find yourself completely out of breath, your veins thrumming with an adrenaline rush you\u2019d missed more than anything in the world.\u00a0</p><p>He really was like a drug, that man.\u00a0</p><p>Supporting your weight with the wall, he slowly moves his hands away from your ass, softly caressing your thighs as you dig your heels into his firm ass.</p><p>His eyes are shut and lips brushing against yours so you could feel and taste every uneven, raggedy breath leaving his red swollen lips.</p><p> Then he moves his head down to your neck, soft lips pressing a light kiss to your flushed skin.\u00a0</p><p>You tremble, throwing your head back to give him more access and becoming completely undone with the feeling of his soft lips working into your skin in soft, sensual pecks. He begins peppering these all over your skin. </p><p>\u201cGod, I love your skin. So soft,\u201d he whispers, his hot breath fanning your already-sensitive skin. <br></p><p>You rake your nails through his hair, biting your lip when you hear him groan lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I love your hair. So soft,\u201d you mock him breathlessly, chuckling softly. </p><p>He looks up at you, breath faltering when he sees you. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking beautiful, have I told you that?\u201d </p><p>You smirk, leaning in and pecking his lips. \u201cOnce or twice.\u201d </p><p>He stares at you a bit longer, lust-filled eyes glimmering beautifully with that softness from before just slightly intensified. You also take this time to admire him in all his after-kiss glory. His even messier hair, his sexy red, swollen lips, his half-hooded hungry eyes. And all of it, all of this, was for you. By you. With you. </p><p><i>He wanted you</i>. And goddamn if you didn\u2019t want him just as bad if not even more. </p><p>Mr. Evans smiles goofily, biting his lip in a failed attempt to conceal it. </p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he mumbles softly after a while of losing yourselves in each others\u2019 gazes.\u00a0</p><p>Almost like it was inevitable to do so. His eyes were gorgeous and you had a slightly frustrating inability to stop staring into them. Though, you wondered what he\u2019d found in yours other than\u2026<i>bleh</i>.\u00a0<br></p><p>You pout, whining. \u201cBut <i>why</i>?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, kissing your forehead lightly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re drunk and it would be a complete dick move to take advantage of you while you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>You smirk, leaning in and softly kissing the shell of his ear.\u00a0\u201cWhat if I said I <i>want </i>you to be a dick?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You almost can\u2019t believe you\u2019re acting like this, but Mr. Evans had become addictive as a drug.</p><p>He sighs deeply, fingers digging into your thighs in a warning.</p><p><i>\u2018Don\u2019t poke the bear Y/n.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI would say there\u2019s literally\u00a0<i>nothing </i>I\u2019d like more but than to make you mine right here right now, but that I\u2019m not that kind of man. And that I won\u2019t go further than what just happened because that in and of itself was wrong of me to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sigh, nodding tightly. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He copies your gesture, sighing softly before <i>very </i>slowly putting you on your feet. </p><p>Your legs were still wobbly and you realized maybe this time the alcohol wasn\u2019t to blame for that.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take me home, Mr. Evans,\u201d you say seriously, looking over at him from the passenger seat. <br></p><p>He raises a brow, shifting uncomfortably in his seat like he\u2019d been doing the past few minutes. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>You chuckle nervously. \u201cUh, my Dad\u2026kinda doesn\u2019t know I came here\u2026And if he were to find out\u2026well, let\u2019s just say \u2018all hell would break loose\u2019 wouldn\u2019t cover it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Evans\u2019s brows rise in shock, basically climbing their way into his hairline. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You mumble. <br></p><p>Then he breaks out into boisterous laughter. \u201cOh my God. You- you really never cease to amaze me, you know that? Just when I think I got you all figured out\u2026you go ahead and do shit like this.\u201d He looks at you again, eyes full with a fondness that sent your stomach fluttering and your heart racing. </p><p> You grin, shrugging bashfully at him. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>He catches your hand, squeezing your fingers. \u201cNo, I mean it, sweetheart. You\u2019re fucking incredible.\u201d </p><p>His beautiful eyes are full with sincerity and warmth and just like a moth drawn to a flame, you can\u2019t help but feel yourself inexplicably drawn to him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing too,\u201d you whisper sincerely, cupping his cheek softly. <br></p><p>The moment is broken by his insistent shifting in his seat. You look pointedly at his crotch area, which still displayed his very prominent, uh- <i>excitement</i>, grinning. </p><p>\u201cYou okay there, Mr. Evans?\u201d <br></p><p>He clears his throat awkwardly, tugging at the jeans barely-concealing his very obvious boner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop teasing me. This is <i>your </i>damn fault,\u201d he hisses.\u00a0</p><p>You laugh.\u00a0\u201cTell me again why I\u00a0\n\nshould \n\n apologize for merely <i>inspiring </i>such a <i>wonderful </i>reaction in you?\u201d<br></p><p>He rolls his eyes, unable to fight off a small grin.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019ll go away eventually. Where do I take you then?\u201d</p><p>You groan.\u00a0\u201cA fucking park bench will do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You blush.\u00a0\u201cThe only other person\u2019s house I can go to is Margo, but she\u2019s off somewhere else taking care of her family emergency.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have any other friends you can call up?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sigh, shaking your head embarrassedly.\u00a0\u201cNo. Listen, I\u2019m sorry. I can just go home and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You look at him, shocked.\u00a0\u201c<i>No</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can come to my place.\u201d He offers you a small smile. \n\n\u00a0</p><p>You immediately shake your head \u2018no\u2019. This offer was <i>ridiculous</i>! With everything that just happened, the level that things had reached, how comfortable you are around him now\u2026it simply wasn\u2019t a wise option to go to his house right now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I couldn\u2019t ask that of you, Mr. Evans! I can deal with an angry father you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Y/n, really. I <i>want </i>to,\u201d he smiles reassuringly.\u00a0<br></p><p>But then again, your angry father wasn\u2019t something you wanted to deal with right now. At all. Just imagining him when he found out what you\u2019d been doing tonight sent unpleasant shivers up your spine.\u00a0</p><p>You sigh.\u00a0\u201cBut isn\u2019t that too much of a risk? What if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about being seen, sweetheart. I live alone and pretty far from here.\u201d</p><p>You chew on your lip nervously, mulling it over even though deep down you already knew your answer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about me trying anything either. I would never do anything like that while you\u2019re drunk or unwilling,\u201d he says sincerely.<br></p><p>You can\u2019t help but raise a teasing brow, smirking.\u00a0\u201cAnd if I was sober and willing?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles lowly, biting his lip and gazing at you with eyes that said everything you needed to know.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling a small delightful shiver run through you at the thought, you clear your throat, breaking the sexually-tense staring contest and leaning into his soft leather seats.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>The drive to Mr. Evans\u2019s house is silent for the first few minutes. Calm. And you take that time to relish in the emotion of having him close to you. Feeling the comfort of his warmth so near you.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nOf hearing his heart beat in sync with yours. Of his scent wafting into your nose constantly. \n\n<br></p><p>Everything happened so fast\u2026 you could barely process the fact that <i>he wanted you too.</i> And not only that, but that you neither of you seemed to care that you were his student and he was your teacher and that all of this, everything that had happened and was happening even now, was so, <i>so </i>inappropriate.\u00a0</p><p>Because when you were together, none of it mattered. When it was just you and him, everyone who\u2019d judge you didn\u2019t exist.\u00a0</p><p>You hear him laughing a low, sexy laugh and look over at him with a smile.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his lip quirks up into a tiny smirk, his eyes still set on the road.\u00a0\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just\u2026remember the last time we were in here together?\u201d</p><p>You suck in a sharp breath at the words, memories of your first kiss flooding back and intensifying, even more, when you remember the kissed that <i>just </i>happened.\u00a0</p><p>The reality of what\u2019d happened- that second kiss. It was unlike any intensity you\u2019d ever felt in your entire life. Even before you even touched lips. You literally felt like if you didn\u2019t kiss him at that exact moment, the very air around you would suffocate you to death.\u00a0</p><p>And feeling him, all of him, pressed up against you like that sent you spiraling into your deepest, darkest fantasies. You wanted him to fuck you on every surface of this car and the throbbing between your legs - the one you\u2019d now had the mere semblance of- came back to you full force, pulsating so hard it forced you to press your thighs together.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mr. Evans\u2019s voice snaps you back to reality and you jump a little.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, uh\u2026yeah. Yeah! I\u2019m fine.\u201d You clear your throat, trying to calm your racing heart and mind.\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026how\u2019d you find me either way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky guess.\u201d He shrugs.\u00a0\u201cHeard some students talking about the huge party at Jenna Millers\u2019 tonight and figured it wasn\u2019t a coincidence you were drunk and calling me while in this state on the same day it was happening.\u201d</p><p>You laugh nervously, cheeks heating up as you recall what you said to him on the phone.\u00a0\u201cYeah, sorry\u00a0\u2018bout what I said on the phone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He grins smugly.\u00a0\u201cSorry? Why are you sorry? I for one think it\u2019s the best phone call I\u2019ve probably <i>ever </i>gotten!\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0You roll your eyes, crossing your arms over your chest. \u201cYeah, yeah. <i>Laugh it up</i>\u2026 How much longer \u2018til we get there?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He smiles.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re still a few minutes away, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You hum in acknowledgment.\u00a0\u201cCan I put on some music?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He raises his brows, but smiles and nods nonetheless, motioning to his radio.\u00a0\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You lean over, feeling strangely giddy as you flip through stations.\u00a0</p><p>You gasp excitedly when you hear the initial notes of your favorite song.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love this song!\u201d You turn the volume up and grin over at Mr. Evans who\u2019s seems bewildered as hell by your seemingly random enthusiasm.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI hopped off the plane at LAX<br>With a dream and my cardigan<br>Welcome to the land of fame excess,<br>Whoa, am I gonna fit in?\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>His expression turns to one of realization and then to bemusement as he watches you lower the window. You let the wind pass through your hair with a big smile on your face, enjoying the chilly night on your flushed skin.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nMy tummy\u2019s turnin\u2019 and I\u2019m feelin\u2019 kinda home sick<br>Too much pressure and I\u2019m nervous,<br>That\u2019s when the taxi man turned on the radio<br>And the Jay Z song was on<br>And the Jay Z song was on<br>And the Jay Z song was on\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>You belt out the lyrics with sheer joy coming out of your every pore.\u00a0\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nSo I put my hands up<br>They\u2019re playing my song,<br>And the butterflies fly away<br>Noddin\u2019 my head like, yeah<br>Movin\u2019 my hips like, yeah<br>I got my hands up,<br>They\u2019re playin\u2019 my song<br>You know I\u2019m gonna be okay<br>Yeah, it\u2019s a party in the USA<br>Yeah it\u2019s a party in the USA\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>When the chorus hits, you have no problem sticking your hand out the window to feel the air rushing in between your fingertips, a\u00a0 Cheshire cat spread wide on your lips.\u00a0</p><p>Mr. Evans laughs loudly at you and you look at him over your shoulder, grinning as you waggle your brows. He laughs louder, turning his eyes back to the road as you continue singing your heart out to\u00a0\u201cParty in the U.S.A.\u201d by Miley Cyrus like your very life depended on it.\u00a0</p><p>The car slows to a stop just as\u00a0the song is ending and you lower the volume of the radio and the window, still grinning from ear to ear.\u00a0</p><p>The house is before you is relatively big. It and the porch painted a thematic white and grey.\u00a0</p><p>Your smile widens impossible more and you turn to Mr. Evans to comment on his house.\u00a0\u201cMr. Evans this house is-<i>mmph!</i>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t get to say anything before his lips are on yours though, his fingers threading into your wind-rustled hair. You immediately respond, cupping his cheeks as he presses a soft and loving kiss to your lips.\u00a0</p><p>When he breaks away, your smile is smaller but softer and loving.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d You whisper breathlessly.\u00a0</p><p>He shrugs, mirroring your smile.\u00a0\u201cFor being so goddamn cute.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And then he\u2019s climbing out of the car, leaving you flushed and bashful and an utter puddle of soft emotions.\u00a0</p><p>You groan into your hands, sinking into the car seat.\u00a0</p><p>How the hell were you supposed to survive even a few hours without jumping this man\u2019s bones?\u00a0</p><p>***</p><h2>Ah, surviving the Evans charm.

You&rsquo;re full of surprises, sweetheart.&rdquo;</p><p>You press your lips to the nape of his neck lightly and mumble gently into the soft skin. &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p><p>He swallows hard and you feel his big warm hands lightly shaking on your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re nothing but trouble Ms. Y/l/n,&rdquo; he practically rasps, his voice strained and husky.</p><p>Uncaring if you&rsquo;re crossing any lines even by simply being in his presence right now, you laugh softly, pressing closer to his warm chest and letting out a content sigh.</p><p>You break away from him, looking up at his face. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you manage to say sincerely through your drunken gaze. &ldquo;For saving me, I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>He clears his throat. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to let him touch you like that.&rdquo; </p><p>You shudder in his arms at the thought of whatever it was that James was planning to do with you. &ldquo;He misunderstood my intentions with him. I only danced with him because it seemed like fun a fun thing to do at the time. But that&rsquo;s all it was. Dancing. And I let him touch me a bit because I thought it was innocent. But then he didn&rsquo;t want to stop when I told him to.&rdquo;</p><p>At this, all signs of lust and humor are gone from his face and he halts his brisk walk in the middle of a lonely street.</p><p>You furrow your brows confusedly at him as he sets you down on the ground gently. You hold onto his neck for support as your legs wobble slightly before entirely untangling yourself from him.</p><p>The street is completely pitch black aside from a single streetlight which only illuminates half of both of you. </p><p>&ldquo;You can walk on your own from here on out. My car&rsquo;s only a few blocks away,&rdquo; he mumbles coldly over his shoulder at you, stalking ahead. </p><p>You raise a brow at his sudden shift in attitude. &ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; you mumble to yourself, clumsily stumbling on behind him. </p><p>It only takes a few minutes of you consistently cursing your drunkness and heels for your inability to walk properly before Mr. Evans stops walking abruptly, causing you to crash head-first against his strong back. You grunt when your nose gets crushed on his firm muscles.</p><p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; You stumble back, rubbing the sore spot frantically in an attempt to massage the ache away. <br /></p><p> When you look back up at him, though, you&rsquo;re shocked to find that he&rsquo;s taken his sunglasses off, bright blue eyes now glaring holes into you.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell were you even thinking Y/n? Huh!?&rdquo; He hisses.</p><p>You blink at him slowly, whiplashing at his sudden change in demeanor. &ldquo;Wha-what do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>He laughs dryly, jabbing an angry finger directly at you. &ldquo;Oh my- I <i>mean</i> that I literally just had to pry off and beat the living hell out of one of my goddam students <i>for you</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>You raise an indignant brow at his accusatory tone. Like this was somehow <i>your </i>fucking fault.</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s my fault, <i>how </i>exactly?&rdquo;</p><p>He scoffs. &ldquo;Well, You came <i>alone </i>to a fucking <i>party,</i> for starters. I mean,&rdquo; he licks his lips, laughing humorlessly. &ldquo;What girl your age fucking does that!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t! Margo had to leave early for a family emergency,&rdquo; you quickly defend before quietly adding; &ldquo;and you didn&rsquo;t <i>have </i>to beat James up like that.&rdquo;</p><p>He runs his long fingers through his hair making his hoodie fall off and licks his lips in pure frustration again.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have- <i>I didn&rsquo;t have to beat James up like that!</i>&rdquo; He laughs darkly mocking your statement before looking down at you incredulously. </p><p>&ldquo;He was putting his damn hands on you sweetheart! He was going to drag you off to god-knows-where to-&ldquo; he instantly cuts himself off, sucking in a sharp breath. His eyes screw shut and his jaw clenches tightly, ticking.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, just thinking about it makes me wanna go back in there to finish what I started,&rdquo; he growls so low under his breath that if it wasn&rsquo;t for the isolation of the place you were in, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to hear him.</p><p>His eyes turn to you once more, the heat of his anger warming your skin as he slowly moves in, stalking up to you with avid, determined steps. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So <i>yes</i>, I did have to beat him up like that. Because he&rsquo;s a goddam scum bag who shouldn&rsquo;t be forcing himself on girls. <i>Especially </i>you!&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s completely red in the face, the veins of his neck prominently protruding from his neck as well as from his forehead. </p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; you pause, frowning in confusion at him. <br /></p><p>He freezes as well and for a second, an expression that screamed &lsquo;oops!&rsquo; flashed on his face before being instantly replaced with an exasperated sigh. &ldquo;Well, yeah. Because you&rsquo;re&hellip;<i>you</i>!&rdquo; he seems flustered, motioning to you loosely. </p><p>You raise an indignant brow, feeling like he&rsquo;s somehow secretly insulting you. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s <i>that </i>supposed to mean?&rdquo; </p><p>He smirks cynically. &ldquo;C&rsquo; mon, Y/n! Let&rsquo;s not fool ourselves. That party is not exactly your scene. You&rsquo;re naive and an innocent sweetheart.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>You can&rsquo;t help it when your alcohol-infested blood boils at his words which were right but nevertheless presumptuous and arrogant.</p><p>&ldquo;First of all, I already fucking told you to stop calling me that,&rdquo; you hiss venomously. &ldquo;Secondly, I&rsquo;m <i>not </i>fucking innocent,&rdquo; you practically scream, balling your fists. &nbsp;</p><p>He laughs at you. He fucking <i>laughs </i>at you!&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you are.&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s making you feel powerless and small and you&rsquo;re completely in the dark for his reasoning behind this sudden display of assholery. He seemed completely fine just a minute ago, but as soon as you mentioned dancing with James, it&rsquo;s like a switch just flipped inside of him.</p><p>You shove him back by his strong chest, and as he was completely caught off guard by your tiny hands, he stumbles back slightly, his heels catching him before he completely fell on his ass.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; You point a threatening finger at him, glaring holes into his head. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re so fucking upset anyways!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because of <i>you</i>!&rdquo; He screams so loud, you almost jump out of your skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Shocked into silence, you glance up at him, your eyes wide.&nbsp;</p><p>You take a moment to look closely at this part of Mr. Evans. The infuriated one. That darkness was back in his eyes, but somehow even darker than before. More untamed and wild. Swirling in his eyes is utter hurt and frustration and he looks even more uncontrolled with his hair all disheveled from his constant running his fingers through the dirty blonde locks. His lips pursed tightly, his nostrils flared and his hands balled into tightly-clenched fists, barely holding back his frustrations. <br /></p><p>His eyes were alive with a fire that fueled that darkness further and you&rsquo;d never felt more attracted to something so aggressive and scary-looking. You wanted the warmth of that fire to envelop you in a tight embrace, to ignite your very being alive with its flames. To make you feel something other than despair and frustration and numbness. &nbsp; </p><p> &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re </i>the fucking reason I&rsquo;m so messed up, Y/n! Look at me!&rdquo; He motions to himself desperately, his voice strained. Then he motions around him, throwing his hands up. &ldquo;Look where I&rsquo;m fucking at right now! It&rsquo;s three in the goddam morning and here I am, in the middle of a fucking street arguing with one of my <i>students </i>about something I shouldn&rsquo;t even <i>be </i>upset by!&rdquo; He laughs dryly, furious eyes locking on yours.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Because why should I give a flying fuck if you&rsquo;re dancing with another guy?! Why the hell should I <i>give a shit </i>if you&rsquo;re letting him put his grubby hands on you?&hellip;&rdquo; his voice falters towards the end of his sentence, chest heaving.&nbsp;</p><p>Leaning on a nearby wall, he runs his fingers through his hair. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t even be here right now. If somebody, <i>anybody</i>&nbsp;in that party recognized me, it could <i>literally </i>ruin my life. What the fuck am I even doing here right now?&rdquo; he breathes to himself. </p><p>Even with the sudden urge to grab his face and kiss the living hell out of him burning and sizzling slowly in the pit of your gut, you know what he&rsquo;s trying to say. He&rsquo;s done so much for you already. Showing up here like that was a huge risk and you were partially at fault for calling him. </p><p>You feel undeniably guilty now. </p><p>It&rsquo;s quiet for a few seconds, with nothing but your heavy breathing filling in the tense, silent atmosphere all around you before you finally speak up, voice shaky and apologetic.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what, Mr. Evans? You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m sorry for making you come all the way here.&rdquo; You smile up at him with a sincere but slightly sad smile as you couldn&rsquo;t hide that tinge of pain you felt. &ldquo;And thanks for everything. Really. I know it&rsquo;s far more than you have to do for any of your students. I&rsquo;ll see you on Monday.&rdquo; </p><p>And with that, you spin on your heel, decisively walking in the opposite direction of where he&rsquo;d been taking you. </p><p>You only get as far as a few steps from him before Mr. Evans&rsquo;s big warm hand is wrapping around your uninjured wrist, halting you mid-step and spinning you back around to face him. </p><p>You frown confusedly. &ldquo;Mr-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <i>understand </i>Y/n,&rdquo; he whispers huskily, chest still heaving with anger, eyes set heavily on you. &ldquo;I knew this had the potential to ruin me in an instant and I still came.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>You open your mouth to speak, but he immediately cuts you off.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize?&rdquo; his laugh isn&rsquo;t mocking or dry this time. It&rsquo;s strained and tired and defeated. Your heart squeezes painfully in your chest at the sound of it. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;The problem isn&rsquo;t that you called me. It&rsquo;s that I <i>still </i>fucking came! Because you&rsquo;re driving me absolutely insane sweetheart. I can&rsquo;t fucking sleep or eat or teach or think or do <i>anything </i>without thinking about you. And it&rsquo;s killing me to see you walk your pretty little ass around school and my class and <i>not </i>think about that kiss and how much I wanna fucking do it again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>His gaze flickers to your slightly parted lips and you can feel your heart positively&nbsp;<i>hammering </i>at his heated confession, ready to rid itself of any inhibitions you may have about any of this in an instant/&nbsp;</p><p>Slowly, eyes half-hooded and set still on your lips, he begins backing you back against the wall behind you, opposite of him. You stumble backward, entirely <i>spellbound </i>by his dark blue eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>His steps are slow and deliberate, giving you the chance to leave at any point.&nbsp; He knew you wouldn&rsquo;t though. He was letting you know that <i>he </i>knew you wouldn&rsquo;t. Hell, that you <i>couldn&rsquo;t. </i>Even if you tried.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with that, he was making sure to prolong the aching in your core for as long as possible. To intensify the desperate anticipation with which you awaited his lips. His touch. </p><p>You can&rsquo;t fight him. Both you and he know you don&rsquo;t <i>want </i>to fight him either. </p><p>A barely-audible gasp leaves your lips when your back meets the cold of a stone wall of some random building. </p><p>He wraps his arms around your hips first, pressing his forehead to yours, brushing his nose on yours softly, teasing. His eyes flutter as he drags his gaze back up to your own heated gaze.</p><p>You could see it in his eyes. He knew this was wrong. He knew the consequences this would eventually bring, but he didn&rsquo;t <i>care</i>. He yearned for your lips just like you did his.&nbsp;</p><p>Gently, he massages his thumbs into the thin, soft fabric of your dress, leaving you breathless and entirely in awe of his power over you. Then his hands, leaving a blazing trail in their wake, make their way up to your waist, squeezing at the skin softly as if to let you know what was happening was real. That you weren&rsquo;t dreaming any of things he was doing to you right now.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>That you weren&rsquo;t making up the requited emotions he felt for you as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Goosebumps rose on your skin and that familiar shudder rippled down your spine in a bold reminder that you were his. His to touch, his to kiss, his to keep. You could never feel the way he made you feel with someone else. Someone else&rsquo;s touch would never ignite the fire in your belly like his did. Not even <i>close</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr.-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have fucking called me, Y/n,&rdquo; he hums huskily against your lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You exhale shakily into his mouth, your breaths mingling, your very being trembling in delight. Unable to say anything, you just look at him desperately,</p><p>His hands make their torturously delicious way up to your neck where he trails a single finger to your shoulders and nape back and forth gently. You sigh in relief, eyes closing in pure ecstasy. </p><p>Finally, his fingers wrap around your cheek and chin, lifting your gaze to properly meet his.&nbsp;</p><p>Your heart is racing in your chest so fast, you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s going to fall out any second now.&nbsp;</p><p>His eyes are dark with anger and lust and frustration, but they&rsquo;re also lighted with something soft and caring. Something you were almost completely convinced resembled <i>love</i>. </p><p>You wanted to drown in his touch. His fragrance obscuring all your senses, putting the vodka you&rsquo;d consumed earlier to shame. It made you feel more intoxicated than the alcohol ever did. Though, instead of numbing you down, it only intensified that painful yearning in your chest and that aggressive throbbing in your core.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing ever hurt better than being in his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Fuck</i>,&rdquo; you strain, pushing against the huge lump in your throat. &ldquo;We have to stop Mr. Evans.&rdquo; Your voice is weak, making it clear to him and yourself that you didn&rsquo;t, in fact, want to &lsquo;stop&rsquo;. <br /></p><p><i>God</i>, no. </p><p>But you had to make an effort to stop this from happening at least. It was wrong. You both knew it and somehow&hellip;you didn&rsquo;t care. </p><p>&ldquo;I know sweetheart. I know. But I don&rsquo;t think I can hold back anymore. I just want to&hellip;&rdquo; his gaze flickers right back to your lips and he groans under his breath. &ldquo;Jesus fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re left breathing against his mouth in raggedy breaths, eyes flickering between his lips and his eyes, admiring the sharp and chiseled edges of his face along the way. The dimmed light of the abandoned street illuminated his face enough so you could admire the keen shape of his jaw, the angular slope of his nose and the soft curves and dips of his plump pink lips. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to run around looking this fucking ravishing and expect me to be able to resist you,&rdquo; he all but growls into you. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even fucking know what you do to me, do you?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Then he presses his entire body to yours. Your chests and lower halves now hugged the one to the other, you can feel just how much you&rsquo;ve affected him and it leaves you spent, that throbbing in your core intensifying by a thousand. Your gut flips in you and a flush of heat spreads through you like wildfire.</p><p> As your heated gazes flare-up in unison, both knowing of what was coming next, you know there&rsquo;s no going back. </p><p>&ldquo;I want you to kiss me, Mr. Evans.&rdquo; &nbsp;Your voice is needy and desperate but you can&rsquo;t find it in you to give a single damn.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s all it takes for the dam to break. In the blink of an eye, Mr. Evans is crashing his lips against yours, <i>hard</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>You suck in a sharp breath as soon as you feel his soft lips make contact with yours. Your chest burned intensely as his wet mouth wrapped around yours harshly, his hands cupping your jaw and roughly tugging you closer to him.&nbsp;</p><p>This kiss is in sharp contrast to your first one, is the first thing you notice. This kiss is rugged and demanding and filled with want much more than the need to comfort eachother.\n\n<br /></p><p>You were both filled up with a desire and need for eachother that was bottomless. And selfish. \n\n</p><p>Merely wanting to feel him as close to you as possible, you snake your arms around his neck and draw him closer.&nbsp;</p><p>Your stomach clenches as you feverishly claimed each other&rsquo;s mouths. </p><p>\n\n Even with the tempo of the kiss set so high thanks to the wanton yearning finally being released within you, you still moved in sync with each other.\n\nHis lips and yours worked together like they were always meant to do so, the delightful feeling of his scruff rubbing against your skin sending another wave of pleasant shivers through your body.&nbsp;</p><p>His soft lips controlled yours with so much passion and unfulfilled want that it almost made your legs give out beneath him. His hold on your waist was almost possessive as he pressed you harder against the wall.&nbsp;</p><p>Your mouth acted upon its own free will, tugging his bottom lip in between your teeth and biting it slowly. You wanted to gauge for what reaction this would get you out of him. To experiment with this newfound need to have such control over a man.&nbsp;</p><p>He growls at the teasing nature of your move and attacks your mouth even more aggressively than before. Hot, wet tongue probing its way into your mouth. </p><p>He tastes like cinnamon and coffee, making you crave him even more. You press yourself into him, meshing your chest to his. </p><p>He works expertly, both your tongues entangling in a dangerous tango.&nbsp;</p><p>His fingers thread into your hair and as if communicating to eachother, you both twist your heads to the side, attempting to get better access at each other&rsquo;s mouths. </p><p>You moved sensually against him, your body moving on its own accord as your hips moved on him in circular motions you had no idea you were even capable of. He grunts a little, his hold on you tightening to a bruising point, almost as if having to physically hold back.&nbsp;</p><p>You found yourself gasping into his mouth at the fairly new feeling of his hardness pressing against you.</p><p>Your hands slither their way up to his neck as you played with the messy strands of his hair, tugging and pulling on them gently, running your fingers through their silky smoothness. Moving your other hand down his muscled back, your nails scraped at the skin over the thin cotton fabric of his band tee. You had an ever-growing desperation bubbling inside you that needed an outlet to be released.</p><p>Your mind was foggy with want and the pleasure steadily building up in your stomach to worry much about the fact that you were practically dry-humping in the middle of a -vacant- street but nonetheless a street, with your<i> English teacher.&nbsp;</i></p><p>All you could focus on was his hands on you, the way he makes the goddamn most animalistic growl you&rsquo;ve ever head because of <i>your </i>pulling of his hair. You feel powerful and sexy. Thoroughly ready to be fucked into oblivion by this man.</p><p>And he wastes no time in gripping your ass in his big hands and hoisting you up like you weighed nothing. </p><p>You yelp into his mouth, instinctively wrapping your legs around his trim waist and your arms around his broad shoulders before he&rsquo;s pressing you back against the wall and attacking your lips once more with urgency in his movements.</p><p>He takes your bottom lip into his mouth and sucks on it gently, causing an inexplicable pressure to press on your core. You can help but rasp out a moan, taking his jaw into your hands and licking his tongue with a tiny swipe.</p><p>He suddenly pauses his kissing you and you find yourself completely out of breath, your veins thrumming with an adrenaline rush you&rsquo;d missed more than anything in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>He really was like a drug, that man.&nbsp;</p><p>Supporting your weight with the wall, he slowly moves his hands away from your ass, softly caressing your thighs as you dig your heels into his firm ass.</p><p>His eyes are shut and lips brushing against yours so you could feel and taste every uneven, raggedy breath leaving his red swollen lips.</p><p> Then he moves his head down to your neck, soft lips pressing a light kiss to your flushed skin.&nbsp;</p><p>You tremble, throwing your head back to give him more access and becoming completely undone with the feeling of his soft lips working into your skin in soft, sensual pecks. He begins peppering these all over your skin. </p><p>&ldquo;God, I love your skin. So soft,&rdquo; he whispers, his hot breath fanning your already-sensitive skin. <br /></p><p>You rake your nails through his hair, biting your lip when you hear him groan lightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And I love your hair. So soft,&rdquo; you mock him breathlessly, chuckling softly. </p><p>He looks up at you, breath faltering when he sees you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking beautiful, have I told you that?&rdquo; </p><p>You smirk, leaning in and pecking his lips. &ldquo;Once or twice.&rdquo; </p><p>He stares at you a bit longer, lust-filled eyes glimmering beautifully with that softness from before just slightly intensified. You also take this time to admire him in all his after-kiss glory. His even messier hair, his sexy red, swollen lips, his half-hooded hungry eyes. And all of it, all of this, was for you. By you. With you. </p><p><i>He wanted you</i>. And goddamn if you didn&rsquo;t want him just as bad if not even more. </p><p>Mr. Evans smiles goofily, biting his lip in a failed attempt to conceal it. </p><p>&ldquo;We should go,&rdquo; he mumbles softly after a while of losing yourselves in each others&rsquo; gazes.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost like it was inevitable to do so. His eyes were gorgeous and you had a slightly frustrating inability to stop staring into them. Though, you wondered what he&rsquo;d found in yours other than&hellip;<i>bleh</i>.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You pout, whining. &ldquo;But <i>why</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles, kissing your forehead lightly. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re drunk and it would be a complete dick move to take advantage of you while you&rsquo;re like this.&rdquo;</p><p>You smirk, leaning in and softly kissing the shell of his ear.&nbsp;&ldquo;What if I said I <i>want </i>you to be a dick?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You almost can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re acting like this, but Mr. Evans had become addictive as a drug.</p><p>He sighs deeply, fingers digging into your thighs in a warning.</p><p><i>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t poke the bear Y/n.&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I would say there&rsquo;s literally&nbsp;<i>nothing </i>I&rsquo;d like more but than to make you mine right here right now, but that I&rsquo;m not that kind of man. And that I won&rsquo;t go further than what just happened because that in and of itself was wrong of me to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You sigh, nodding tightly. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He copies your gesture, sighing softly before <i>very </i>slowly putting you on your feet. </p><p>Your legs were still wobbly and you realized maybe this time the alcohol wasn&rsquo;t to blame for that.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take me home, Mr. Evans,&rdquo; you say seriously, looking over at him from the passenger seat. <br /></p><p>He raises a brow, shifting uncomfortably in his seat like he&rsquo;d been doing the past few minutes. &ldquo;And why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>You chuckle nervously. &ldquo;Uh, my Dad&hellip;kinda doesn&rsquo;t know I came here&hellip;And if he were to find out&hellip;well, let&rsquo;s just say &lsquo;all hell would break loose&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t cover it.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Evans&rsquo;s brows rise in shock, basically climbing their way into his hairline. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You mumble. <br /></p><p>Then he breaks out into boisterous laughter. &ldquo;Oh my God. You- you really never cease to amaze me, you know that? Just when I think I got you all figured out&hellip;you go ahead and do shit like this.&rdquo; He looks at you again, eyes full with a fondness that sent your stomach fluttering and your heart racing. </p><p> You grin, shrugging bashfully at him. &ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>He catches your hand, squeezing your fingers. &ldquo;No, I mean it, sweetheart. You&rsquo;re fucking incredible.&rdquo; </p><p>His beautiful eyes are full with sincerity and warmth and just like a moth drawn to a flame, you can&rsquo;t help but feel yourself inexplicably drawn to him. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing too,&rdquo; you whisper sincerely, cupping his cheek softly. <br /></p><p>The moment is broken by his insistent shifting in his seat. You look pointedly at his crotch area, which still displayed his very prominent, uh- <i>excitement</i>, grinning. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay there, Mr. Evans?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>He clears his throat awkwardly, tugging at the jeans barely-concealing his very obvious boner.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop teasing me. This is <i>your </i>damn fault,&rdquo; he hisses.&nbsp;</p><p>You laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me again why I&nbsp;\n\nshould \n\n apologize for merely <i>inspiring </i>such a <i>wonderful </i>reaction in you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He rolls his eyes, unable to fight off a small grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll go away eventually. Where do I take you then?&rdquo;</p><p>You groan.&nbsp;&ldquo;A fucking park bench will do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You blush.&nbsp;&ldquo;The only other person&rsquo;s house I can go to is Margo, but she&rsquo;s off somewhere else taking care of her family emergency.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any other friends you can call up?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You sigh, shaking your head embarrassedly.&nbsp;&ldquo;No. Listen, I&rsquo;m sorry. I can just go home and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You look at him, shocked.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>No</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. You can come to my place.&rdquo; He offers you a small smile. \n\n&nbsp;</p><p>You immediately shake your head &lsquo;no&rsquo;. This offer was <i>ridiculous</i>! With everything that just happened, the level that things had reached, how comfortable you are around him now&hellip;it simply wasn&rsquo;t a wise option to go to his house right now.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not. I couldn&rsquo;t ask that of you, Mr. Evans! I can deal with an angry father you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Y/n, really. I <i>want </i>to,&rdquo; he smiles reassuringly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>But then again, your angry father wasn&rsquo;t something you wanted to deal with right now. At all. Just imagining him when he found out what you&rsquo;d been doing tonight sent unpleasant shivers up your spine.&nbsp;</p><p>You sigh.&nbsp;&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that too much of a risk? What if-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about being seen, sweetheart. I live alone and pretty far from here.&rdquo;</p><p>You chew on your lip nervously, mulling it over even though deep down you already knew your answer.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t worry about me trying anything either. I would never do anything like that while you&rsquo;re drunk or unwilling,&rdquo; he says sincerely.<br /></p><p>You can&rsquo;t help but raise a teasing brow, smirking.&nbsp;&ldquo;And if I was sober and willing?&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles lowly, biting his lip and gazing at you with eyes that said everything you needed to know.&nbsp;</p><p>Feeling a small delightful shiver run through you at the thought, you clear your throat, breaking the sexually-tense staring contest and leaning into his soft leather seats.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>The drive to Mr. Evans&rsquo;s house is silent for the first few minutes. Calm. And you take that time to relish in the emotion of having him close to you. Feeling the comfort of his warmth so near you.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\nOf hearing his heart beat in sync with yours. Of his scent wafting into your nose constantly. \n\n<br /></p><p>Everything happened so fast&hellip; you could barely process the fact that <i>he wanted you too.</i> And not only that, but that you neither of you seemed to care that you were his student and he was your teacher and that all of this, everything that had happened and was happening even now, was so, <i>so </i>inappropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>Because when you were together, none of it mattered. When it was just you and him, everyone who&rsquo;d judge you didn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp;</p><p>You hear him laughing a low, sexy laugh and look over at him with a smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>The corner of his lip quirks up into a tiny smirk, his eyes still set on the road.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;remember the last time we were in here together?&rdquo;</p><p>You suck in a sharp breath at the words, memories of your first kiss flooding back and intensifying, even more, when you remember the kissed that <i>just </i>happened.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality of what&rsquo;d happened- that second kiss. It was unlike any intensity you&rsquo;d ever felt in your entire life. Even before you even touched lips. You literally felt like if you didn&rsquo;t kiss him at that exact moment, the very air around you would suffocate you to death.&nbsp;</p><p>And feeling him, all of him, pressed up against you like that sent you spiraling into your deepest, darkest fantasies. You wanted him to fuck you on every surface of this car and the throbbing between your legs - the one you&rsquo;d now had the mere semblance of- came back to you full force, pulsating so hard it forced you to press your thighs together.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Mr. Evans&rsquo;s voice snaps you back to reality and you jump a little.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Oh, uh&hellip;yeah. Yeah! I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; You clear your throat, trying to calm your racing heart and mind.&nbsp;&ldquo;So&hellip;how&rsquo;d you find me either way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky guess.&rdquo; He shrugs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Heard some students talking about the huge party at Jenna Millers&rsquo; tonight and figured it wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence you were drunk and calling me while in this state on the same day it was happening.&rdquo;</p><p>You laugh nervously, cheeks heating up as you recall what you said to him on the phone.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, sorry&nbsp;&lsquo;bout what I said on the phone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He grins smugly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry? Why are you sorry? I for one think it&rsquo;s the best phone call I&rsquo;ve probably <i>ever </i>gotten!&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;You roll your eyes, crossing your arms over your chest. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah. <i>Laugh it up</i>&hellip; How much longer &lsquo;til we get there?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He smiles.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still a few minutes away, sweetheart.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You hum in acknowledgment.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I put on some music?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He raises his brows, but smiles and nods nonetheless, motioning to his radio.&nbsp;&ldquo;Help yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You lean over, feeling strangely giddy as you flip through stations.&nbsp;</p><p>You gasp excitedly when you hear the initial notes of your favorite song.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love this song!&rdquo; You turn the volume up and grin over at Mr. Evans who&rsquo;s seems bewildered as hell by your seemingly random enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI hopped off the plane at LAX<br />With a dream and my cardigan<br />Welcome to the land of fame excess,<br />Whoa, am I gonna fit in?\n\n</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>His expression turns to one of realization and then to bemusement as he watches you lower the window. You let the wind pass through your hair with a big smile on your face, enjoying the chilly night on your flushed skin.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nMy tummy&rsquo;s turnin&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; kinda home sick<br />Too much pressure and I&rsquo;m nervous,<br />That&rsquo;s when the taxi man turned on the radio<br />And the Jay Z song was on<br />And the Jay Z song was on<br />And the Jay Z song was on\n\n</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>You belt out the lyrics with sheer joy coming out of your every pore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nSo I put my hands up<br />They&rsquo;re playing my song,<br />And the butterflies fly away<br />Noddin&rsquo; my head like, yeah<br />Movin&rsquo; my hips like, yeah<br />I got my hands up,<br />They&rsquo;re playin&rsquo; my song<br />You know I&rsquo;m gonna be okay<br />Yeah, it&rsquo;s a party in the USA<br />Yeah it&rsquo;s a party in the USA\n\n</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>When the chorus hits, you have no problem sticking your hand out the window to feel the air rushing in between your fingertips, a&nbsp; Cheshire cat spread wide on your lips.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Evans laughs loudly at you and you look at him over your shoulder, grinning as you waggle your brows. He laughs louder, turning his eyes back to the road as you continue singing your heart out to&nbsp;&ldquo;Party in the U.S.A.&rdquo; by Miley Cyrus like your very life depended on it.&nbsp;</p><p>The car slows to a stop just as&nbsp;the song is ending and you lower the volume of the radio and the window, still grinning from ear to ear.&nbsp;</p><p>The house is before you is relatively big. It and the porch painted a thematic white and grey.&nbsp;</p><p>Your smile widens impossible more and you turn to Mr. Evans to comment on his house.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mr. Evans this house is-<i>mmph!</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t get to say anything before his lips are on yours though, his fingers threading into your wind-rustled hair. You immediately respond, cupping his cheeks as he presses a soft and loving kiss to your lips.&nbsp;</p><p>When he breaks away, your smile is smaller but softer and loving.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that for?&rdquo; You whisper breathlessly.&nbsp;</p><p>He shrugs, mirroring your smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;For being so goddamn cute.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>And then he&rsquo;s climbing out of the car, leaving you flushed and bashful and an utter puddle of soft emotions.&nbsp;</p><p>You groan into your hands, sinking into the car seat.&nbsp;</p><p>How the hell were you supposed to survive even a few hours without jumping this man&rsquo;s bones?&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><h2>Ah, surviving the Evans charm.
