I\u2019ve seen a few disappointed that Jonah doesn\u2019t know ASL and only communicates to Libby through texts, myself being one of them. But the more I think about it, the more it makes sense and the more I thought of the potential for an interesting story.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s pretty clear the angle the show is going for with Jonah and Libby\u2019s relationship: how Jonah is still continuing to fail to communicate in his romantic relationships, as he seemingly doesn\u2019t seem concerned with learning ASL which as Andi subtly points out would be more effective and just more meaningful in terms of Jonah and Libby\u2019s relationship. I don\u2019t think this comes from Jonah being lazy, but rather unwilling or simply unable to properly communicate his feelings to someone else in a healthy way. This means that this flaw with Jonah, being unable to express his emotions in healthy manner, will finally be pushed to the forefront of his character since this flaw will be taken to an extreme length with his relationship with Libby. Something to note here is Andi\u2019s interactions with Libby. Notice how she doesn\u2019t seem threatened or insecure around her, but is rather friendly and confident during their conversation. Her comment about Jonah\u2019s method of communication with Libby comes more from a place of genuine concern than wanting to poke holes in their relationship for her own gain. This is great for two reasons: one, it shows how much Andi\u2019s character has matured and developed, and two, it could mean that there\u2019s some actual potential for her and Jonah to end up being friends. Why do I say this? Well, now that Andi seemingly has no romantic interest in Jonah, she can be far more critical of his shortcomings in a constructive manner, no longer blinded by her feelings. This gives me a lot of hope for Jonah\u2019s character, as without the anchor that was Jandi holding him back, we could not only see his character grow in ways unrelated to his relationship to Andi but see Andi interact with Jonah in a healthy, platonic way. I won\u2019t get my hopes up too much, since that\u2019s how I felt back with 2b when it came to Jonah\u2019s subplot, but I\u2019m remaining cautiously optimistic.\u00a0</p><p>But there\u2019s a whole other part to this story and that\u2019s Libby herself, which many have presumed will be similar to Andi in terms of personality based on their shared interest in crafts, and how Andi could realize this and think about how Jonah has a\u00a0\u201ctype\u201d. I want to be clear before I state this next part because I could see people misinterpreting it: Libby is her own character and I do think she will have some decent if minor development and DO NOT THINK the writers are merely using her as a tool. That being said, I think her purpose in the story will be to highlight Jonah\u2019s failure of communication by taking it into an extreme measure due to her disability, and that once that story is put into motion, she might become irrelevant to story overall. I say this as someone who instantly fell in love with her character and would want nothing more than for Libby to show up in the every episode the rest of the season, but I get the feeling this character\u2019s run will be short-lived, though not necessarily bad.\u00a0</p><p>Keep in mind, I\u2019m no master of predictions, and there could be some piece of behind the scenes knowledge with scheduling that proves me wrong (I don\u2019t keep up with that sort of thing), and I could be wrong cause it was just a 45 second clip, but everything else this season has seemingly been building up to finally confronting Jonah\u2019s flaws in a meaningful way, starting by Andi finally becoming a friend who can help Jonah without getting hung up on romantic tensions between them.\u00a0</p>",
