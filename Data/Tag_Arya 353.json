        "body": "<h1>Gendrya Fanfic</h1><p>Something that really bothers me with the gendrya fandom is the fan fiction. Now, I have never been a big fan of fanfics anyway. I\u2019ve read some when I was like 14-16 and one day I just stopped because I couldn\u2019t deal with the <i>falseness</i> of it anymore. There were some that were quite good but 99% of the ones that I\u2019ve read (and I\u2019m not just talking about gendrya fic here, these are the ones I\u2019ve read when I was younger and in different fandoms) were just bad. It\u2019s usually not the plot that makes a fanfic bad. It\u2019s the characters. Because the characters that we know, that we love suddenly turn into complete clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. They are such twisted forms of their originals that they feel like new found characters purely drawn out of the fan fic writes\u2019s mind that have nothing to do with the real characters. That often happens because (1) we don\u2019t analyse the characters thoroughly (2) we simply don\u2019t understand some of their aspects that no matter how unimportant they seem have a huge impact on our perception of them as individuals or (3) we don\u2019t like some of their character traits so we leave them out thus matching them with our wishes and changing them. And the thing that frustrates me is not the delusions of the writers but the fact that they transfer them to the readers and by doing that they change <i>their</i> perception of the characters as well and give them their own false, subjective image of the characters. And that\u2019s almost always the case. I recently started a Gendrya fic where Arya and Gendry were just so ooc that I immediately stopped reading it. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Arya is viewed as the tomboy-that-hates-all-girls-and-wishes-she-had-a-d***, as an irrational rage monster and as a psychotic loner that wears black and hates everyone. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Gendry is seen as the nice-guy-that-doesn\u2019t-have-a-backbone when in most fanfics he has fallen into the \u201cplain handsome guy that would do anything for the girl\u201d- trope. And really anyone who has read the books at least once knows that that\u2019s simply not true. You don\u2019t need to have an English major or be a literature student to see that. The text does not support this. It\u2019s nowhere implied. It\u2019s just complete trash and untrue. The reason why this happens is because we tend to think in boxes. A boy that writes poetry and has female friends? He\u2019s gay! A girl that doesn\u2019t wear make-up and dresses in plain clothes? She\u2019s special and better than other girls! Arya is a tomboy? Well ofc she doesn\u2019t want kids and only hangs out with guys and thinks that feelings are stupid and make you weak! And because she is a \u201cstrong\u201d woman (god I hate that term) she is either not going to have a lover OR her lover will be weak and submissive so that <i>her</i> strength is more emphasised. Which is why Gendry is (often) portrayed as less stubborn and defiant and mellowed down, despite his (canon!!) strong, stubborn and forceful personality. And what\u2019s the point in that? By changing the characters you also change their dynamic that we were so invested in and which was the reason why we started reading fanfics in the first place. So what\u2019s the point in reading them? It really makes me angry. Because I love the characters and I hate that people twist them around in their heads and give them traits that we have no reason in believing they possess. I just really wanted to get this out and let me know if you feel the same way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just gendrya fanfic, I\u2019ve read enough other fanfics that had the same problems. Maybe it\u2019s also the age that\u2019s the problem since a lot of fics are written by younger fans that are not mature enough to understand the complexity and depth of these characters but I hope it will change.</p>",

I\u2019ve read some when I was like 14-16 and one day I just stopped because I couldn\u2019t deal with the <i>falseness</i> of it anymore. There were some that were quite good but 99% of the ones that I\u2019ve read (and I\u2019m not just talking about gendrya fic here, these are the ones I\u2019ve read when I was younger and in different fandoms) were just bad. It\u2019s usually not the plot that makes a fanfic bad. It\u2019s the characters. Because the characters that we know, that we love suddenly turn into complete clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. They are such twisted forms of their originals that they feel like new found characters purely drawn out of the fan fic writes\u2019s mind that have nothing to do with the real characters. That often happens because (1) we don\u2019t analyse the characters thoroughly (2) we simply don\u2019t understand some of their aspects that no matter how unimportant they seem have a huge impact on our perception of them as individuals or (3) we don\u2019t like some of their character traits so we leave them out thus matching them with our wishes and changing them. And the thing that frustrates me is not the delusions of the writers but the fact that they transfer them to the readers and by doing that they change <i>their</i> perception of the characters as well and give them their own false, subjective image of the characters. And that\u2019s almost always the case. I recently started a Gendrya fic where Arya and Gendry were just so ooc that I immediately stopped reading it. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Arya is viewed as the tomboy-that-hates-all-girls-and-wishes-she-had-a-d***, as an irrational rage monster and as a psychotic loner that wears black and hates everyone. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Gendry is seen as the nice-guy-that-doesn\u2019t-have-a-backbone when in most fanfics he has fallen into the \u201cplain handsome guy that would do anything for the girl\u201d- trope. And really anyone who has read the books at least once knows that that\u2019s simply not true. You don\u2019t need to have an English major or be a literature student to see that. The text does not support this. It\u2019s nowhere implied. It\u2019s just complete trash and untrue. The reason why this happens is because we tend to think in boxes. A boy that writes poetry and has female friends? He\u2019s gay! A girl that doesn\u2019t wear make-up and dresses in plain clothes? She\u2019s special and better than other girls! Arya is a tomboy? Well ofc she doesn\u2019t want kids and only hangs out with guys and thinks that feelings are stupid and make you weak! And because she is a \u201cstrong\u201d woman (god I hate that term) she is either not going to have a lover OR her lover will be weak and submissive so that <i>her</i> strength is more emphasised. Which is why Gendry is (often) portrayed as less stubborn and defiant and mellowed down, despite his (canon!!) strong, stubborn and forceful personality. And what\u2019s the point in that? By changing the characters you also change their dynamic that we were so invested in and which was the reason why we started reading fanfics in the first place. So what\u2019s the point in reading them? It really makes me angry. Because I love the characters and I hate that people twist them around in their heads and give them traits that we have no reason in believing they possess. I just really wanted to get this out and let me know if you feel the same way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just gendrya fanfic, I\u2019ve read enough other fanfics that had the same problems. Maybe it\u2019s also the age that\u2019s the problem since a lot of fics are written by younger fans that are not mature enough to understand the complexity and depth of these characters but I hope it will change.</p></p>",

And not just needlework, but likely other crafts (drawing, painting), and musical instruments too.*<br /></p><p>Mind you, I don&rsquo;t think Arya has realized that her sword hand (and <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=stick+left+hand&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;povs%5B%5D=Arya\">stick hand</a>) is the one she should be using for other coordinated work, as per her TWOW preview chapter Mercy&rsquo;s sewing is still &ldquo;wretched&rdquo;. Maybe that will change eventually?</p><p><small>*(Note: I&rsquo;m a lefty, and though I never had trouble with my teachers due to observant and caring parents (my dad&rsquo;s a lefty too), I think my \nleft-handedness was a possible reason why I never had much in the way of music lessons. Also note that my younger brother did have a teacher who claimed he couldn&rsquo;t write, until my parents found out the reason, that she was trying to force him right, and well that teacher got her ass handed to her, and the situation fixed immediately.)</small><br /></p>",
