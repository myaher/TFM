        "body": "<p>OK, In early Spring, D.B. Weiss and Daniel Benioff helped create a new Spotify playlist: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXdnZT5DhATDx?si=Fm6C_nfHShCGLFHVluC5qQ\"><i>Game of Thrones</i>: The End Is Coming</a>. Upon doing so, they told For the Record in an email, \u201cThe answer to the ending is one hundred percent hidden in the playlist choices. No one will believe us, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>I have spent the last couple of weeks going through each song and trying to figure out which character, which scenario, arc, storyline each song was about. I could be completely way-off, but it was fun. So here you. Enjoy! (Note: All songs link to full lyrics.)</p><p>Fair warning, this is long. Very long. So long that I\u2019m going to put a cut. I will say&hellip; yeah, this playlist screams Gendrya endgame.</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><h2><a href=\"denied:ttps://www.lyricsbox.com/rage-against-the-machine-sleep-now-in-the-fire-lyrics-72b191k.html\">Sleep Now in the Fire - Rage Against the Machine</a>\u00a0</h2><p>Dany as Mad Queen.<br/></p><blockquote><p>The world is my expense<br/>The cost of my desire<br/>Jesus blessed me with its future<br/>And I protect it with fire<br/>So raise your fists and march around<br/>Dont dare take what you need<br/>I\u2019ll jail and bury those committed<br/>And smother the rest in greed<br/>Crawl with me into tomorrow<br/>Or i\u2019ll drag you to your grave<br/>I\u2019m deep inside your children<br/>They\u2019ll betray you in my name </p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/danzig-her-black-wings-lyrics-4x87flw.html\">Her Black Wings - Danzig</a></h2><p>This one seems to fit Arya in the first three episodes of the season.</p><blockquote><p>She brings the lust<br/>Supernatural<br/>Ceasing never<br/>On and<br/>On and<br/>On<br/>Her stride is such<br/>Mortals freeze<br/>When she walks past<br/>And she comes down to me<br/>And she offers me sleep<br/>Under her black wings</p></blockquote><p>Think about Arya flying down to kill the Night King, that fits with the \u201cUnder her black wings.\u201d And \u201cMortals freeze when she falls by&quot; and the mention of the &ldquo;supernatural,&rdquo; all fit the Faceless men training and her overall ability to walk silent and her skills.</p><blockquote><p>Entwined with love<br/>Unclean she is</p></blockquote><p>Everything Arya is doing, everything that she has done, every kill has been done for love, to avenge the people she loves, to protect those she loves. And yet, she&rsquo;s so surrounded, covered, engulfed in death that she&rsquo;s unclean.</p><blockquote><p>See she comes<br/>Blacker than pitch<br/>Have to make this fallen bitch<br/>All I want<br/>All I crave<br/>Demoness calls<br/>The bitch is come<br/>For those who wait<br/>Cross the breach in hell<br/>See she is<br/>Bedeviled with breasts<br/>Enchantment on legs</p></blockquote><p>This stanza here even fits her if you take into account the fact that the Hound calls her a bitch all the time, and the last two lines, well, we do see Arya as a woman for the first time this season. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/led-zeppelin-immigrant-song-lyrics-lvxdt1w.html\">Immigrant Song (Remaster) - Led Zeppelin</a></h2><p>\n\nThe Army of the Undead want to take over Westeros.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-doors-end-lyrics-pr4s3dw.html\">The End (Remaster) - The Doors</a></h2><p>The could certainly be about Jaime and Cersei, but something about it just says the Hound and Arya to me because of a line in the final stanza: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never follow me&rdquo; and that obviously does not apply to the twins. Plus, there is a reference to a \u201cStranger\u201d in the song. The Hound&rsquo;s horse was &ldquo;Stranger&rdquo; and, of course, as has been established this season, the Hound=death and in the faith of the Seven, the Stranger represents death.</p><blockquote><p>This is the end<br/>Beautiful friend<br/>This is the end<br/>My only friend</p><p>The end<br/>Of our elaborate plans<br/>The end<br/>Of everything that stands<br/>The end<br/>No safety or surprise<br/>The end<br/>I&rsquo;ll never look into your eyes<br/>Again</p><p>Can you picture what will be<br/>So limitless and free<br/>Desperately in need of some stranger&rsquo;s hand<br/>In a desperate land</p></blockquote><p>Arya is the Hound&rsquo;s only friend, and in many ways, he&rsquo;s Arya&rsquo;s only friend now that Gendry has become something more. It&rsquo;s the end of their journey together. </p><p>There is this stanza which is why one could think it references Jaime and Cersei with the references to father, brother and sister:</p><blockquote><p>The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on<br/>He took a face from the ancient gallery<br/>And he walked on down the hall<br/>He went into the room where his sister lived, and&hellip;then he<br/>Paid a visit to his brother, and then he<br/>He walked on down the hall, and<br/>And he came to a door&hellip;and he looked inside<br/>&ldquo;Father?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, son.&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to kill you.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Mother, I want to&hellip;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>But I took that as more allegorical, the Hound being the killer who is ready to finally kill his family, i.e., his brother. </p><p>And then we come to the end of the song and it is full of profanity after profanity, the Hound&rsquo;s calling card before leading to death and then those lines that just scream the Hound to Arya.</p><blockquote><p>Fuck, fuck-ah, yeah<br/>Fuck<br/>Fuck<br/>Fuck, fuck<br/>Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah<br/>C'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah<br/>Fuck me, baby, fuck yeah<br/>Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah!<br/>Fuck, yeah! C'mon, baby<br/>Fuck me, baby, fuck, fuck, yeah<br/>Whoa, whoa, yeah, fuck, baby<br/>C'mon, yeah, huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah<br/>All right</p><p>Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill</p><p>This is the end<br/>Beautiful friend<br/>This is the end<br/>My only friend, the end</p><p><b>It hurts to set you free<br/>But you&rsquo;ll never follow me</b><br/>The end of laughter and soft lies<br/><b>The end of nights we tried to die</b></p><p>This is the end</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/bob-dylan-feat.-johnny-cash-girl-from-the-north-country-lyrics-wlck3j6.html\">Girl From the North Country - Bob Dylan</a></h2><p>Yes, I know there is a line in this song that references the girl&rsquo;s long hair lying past her breast, but regardless, everything else about this song just screams pre-season Gendry and Arya. \u00a0It totally, totally does. It just totally is Gendry pining for Arya. Nothing else makes sense. N-O-T-H-I-N-G!\u00a0</p><p>I know that some have tried to fit it with Sansa and Tyrion, and I love them, but it just doesn&rsquo;t fit them. Sansa is in no way Tyrion\u2019s true love, she just isn&rsquo;t. He hasn&rsquo;t been thinking of her throughout his time away from her. We know that. We absolutely know that. It does not fit them, sorry Sanrion fans (I\u2019m one of them).</p><p>Now, if there is some time jump that we see in episode 06 before Arya goes to Gendry (because, yes, I&rsquo;m still convinced that we are getting an Arya/Gendry endgame), then maybe this will apply to *that* timeframe, but as of now, I still see it as pre-season 08 Gendrya, just the feeling, the tenor and tone of it. Think of Gendry&rsquo;s line to her in the second episode:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>The last time you saw me, you asked me to come to Winterfell. I took the long road\u2026 </p></blockquote><p>Yeah. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/guns-n-roses-mama-kin-lyrics-fq4j59q.html\">Mama Kin (Live Version) - Guns n Roses</a></h2><p>(FYI: These are the lyrics for the live version, so they may differ slightly.)</p><p>I believe this one is about Cersei and how her life has been spent living a lie, putting on a show, but it\u2019s all just that, a show.</p><blockquote><p>losin\u2019 touch with all that\u2019s real<br/>Whole lotta lover, keepin\u2019 undercover</p></blockquote><p>Cersei so often just can\u2019t face the reality of all the shit going on around her, through most of her relationship with Jaime, she kept that a secret and even kept her other lovers a secret from him. </p><blockquote><p>You\u2019ve been fadin\u2019, always out paradin\u2019</p></blockquote><p>Cersei has always been hiding who she really is, pretending to be the perfect queen, the perfect wife, perfect mother.</p><blockquote><p>Spittin\u2019 fire from your mouth just like a dragon</p></blockquote><p>She does incest like the Targaryens. She&rsquo;s crazy like the Targaryens, but she&rsquo;s not a Targaryen. </p><blockquote><p>You better check it out \u2018cause someday soon<br/>You\u2019ll have to climb back on the wagon</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not going to last, she\u2019s not going to get her happy ending. (Duh.)</p><blockquote><p>It ain\u2019t easy livin\u2019 like you want to</p></blockquote><p>She became the queen, the ruler of the seven kingdoms, but NOTHING has come easy and it\u2019s still hard for and she never had peace or happiness.</p><blockquote><p>And workin\u2019 for daddy\u2019s such a drag<br/>You still stuff your mouth With his beans</p></blockquote><p>She as always under Twyin\u2019s control, she hated it, but she was always under his thumb, always playing by his rules.</p><p>This was all about Cersei not being good enough, wanting more, but never getting it, giving up everything and never getting it. She should have cherished what mattered, but she didn\u2019t and lost everything consequently.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitestripes/sevennationarmy.html\">Seven Nation Army - The White Stripes\u00a0</a></h2><p>Dany as Mad Queen. Now, this could have been about Cersei, but there\u2019s a line that screams treason, so\u2026 Dany.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI&rsquo;m gonna fight &lsquo;em off<br/>A seven nation army couldn&rsquo;t hold me back<br/>They&rsquo;re gonna rip it off<br/><b>Taking their time right behind my back</b><br/>And I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to myself at night<br/>Because I can&rsquo;t forget<br/>Back and forth through my mind\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blackkeys/howlinforyou.html\">Howlin For You - The Black Keys</a></h2><p>\n\nThis is so obviously Gendry about Arya that they might as well have revealed it as such after episode 02 in the &ldquo;Inside the Episode&rdquo; video.\n\n<br/></p><blockquote><p>I must admit<br/>I can&rsquo;t explain<br/>Any of these thoughts racing<br/>Through my brain</p><p>It&rsquo;s true<br/>Baby I&rsquo;m howlin&rsquo; for you</p><p>Can&rsquo;t you see<br/>Little girl&rsquo;s<br/>Got a hold on me</p><p>Like glue<br/>Baby I&rsquo;m howlin&rsquo; for you</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/grandson/war.html\">War - Grandson</a>\u00a0</h2><p>Pretty clearly about the war against the Undead.</p><h2><a href=\"https://genius.com/Des-rocs-let-me-live-let-me-die-lyrics\">Let Me Live/Let Me Die - Des Rocs</a></h2><p>Arya again, specifically with Beric sacrificing himself to save her and then her going to kill the Night King.</p><blockquote><p>I know pain, I know dread<br/>Wicked veins, they turn to lead<br/>Tears don\u2019t stop the fire<br/>It&rsquo;s killing time</p><p>Back from the dead<br/>See, their eyes got nothing left<br/>Kiss me, I am the cobra<br/>It&rsquo;s killing time</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://lyricstranslate.com/en/flugufrelsarinn-flys-savior.html-0\">Flugufrelsarinn - Sigur Ros</a></h2><p>This was in another language, I read the translation and I\u2019m so not sure, but I\u2019m thinking maybe Grey Worm and Missandei\u2026</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tommorello/cantstopthebleeding.html\">Can&rsquo;t Stop The Bleeding - Tom Morello feat. Gary Clark Jr. and Gramatik</a></h2><p>I think this is Tyrion realizing that Dany is not the one. Interestingly enough, prior to last week, this song was NOT on the playlist. There were only 50 songs and then, boom!, this one was added.</p><blockquote><p>Can&rsquo;t stop the bleeding, calling<br/>Can&rsquo;t stop the bleeding, oh</p><p>Fill my soul, it&rsquo;s hard to see<br/>Trouble found and trouble lost<br/>20 miles dark and deep<br/>Trouble paid and trouble bought, uh</p><p>Frayed like myth, every fool caught it<br/>Sound like this, every fool bought it</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion was duped into believing that Daenerys was the Princess that was Promised, and I think he&rsquo;s going to something drastic about it.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/barns-courtney-fire-lyrics-lzk3qcl.html\">Fire - Barns Courtney</a></h2><p>Ceganebowl!</p><blockquote><p>Oh, a thousand faces staring at me<br/>Thousand times I&rsquo;ve fallen<br/>Thousand voices dead at my feet<br/>Now I&rsquo;m gone, now I&rsquo;m gone, now I&rsquo;m gone</p><p>And my mother told me, &ldquo;Son, let it be.&rdquo;<br/>Sold my soul to the calling<br/>Sold my soul to a sweet melody<br/>Now I&rsquo;m gone, now I&rsquo;m gone, now I&rsquo;m gone</p><p>Oh, gimme that fire<br/>Oh, gimme that fire<br/>Oh, gimme that fire<br/>Burn, burn, burn</p></blockquote><p>The mother in the song is metaphorical or one could take it as the Mother of the New Gods and the Mother stands, among other things, for mercy and peace. And we all know that the Hound is not going to 'Let it be&quot; so it&rsquo;s pretty clear that this is the Hound facing his deepest fear&ndash;diving headfirst into fire&ndash;at the same time finally getting his soul&rsquo;s desire and taking out his brother.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/missio-bottom-of-the-deep-blue-sea-lyrics-fr61lsv.html\">Bottom of the Deep Blue Sea - MISSIO</a></h2><p>The pretty gross relationship between Euron and Cersei, and after episode 05, more specifically, the demise of Euron Greyjoy! (The crowd cheers!)</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pixies/waveofmutilation.html\">Wave of Mutilation - Pixies</a>\u00a0</h2><p>This one&rsquo;s about Theon.</p><blockquote><p>cease to resist, giving my goodbye<br/>drive my car into the ocean<br/>you&rsquo;ll think i&rsquo;m dead, but i sail away<br/>on a wave of mutilation<br/>a wave<br/>wave</p><p>i&rsquo;ve kissed mermaids, rode the el nino<br/>walked the sand with the crustaceans<br/>could find my way to mariana<br/>on a wave of mutilation,<br/>wave of mutilation<br/>wave of mutilation<br/>wave</p></blockquote><p>Saying goodbye to Yara, the ocean references, &ldquo;What is dead may never die&rdquo; = &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll think i&rsquo;m dead, but i sail away,&rdquo; the mutilation&quot; theme. \u00a0Yeah, good ole Theon.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/tv-on-the-radio-wolf-like-me-lyrics-w66mmbn.html\">Wolf Like Me - TV On the Radio</a></h2><p>I think this is about Sansa to Tyrion, using him to get to Dany.</p><blockquote><p>Say<br/>Say my playmate<br/>Won&rsquo;t you lay your hands on me<br/>Mirror my malady<br/>Transfer my tragedy</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Playmate&rdquo; as in someone who is playing the 'game&rsquo; with her, and the final two lines, the two of them sharing their fears, their miseries, knowing what the other has been through.</p><blockquote><p>We could jet in a stolen car<br/>But I bet we wouldn&rsquo;t get too far<br/>Before the transformation takes<br/>And bloodlust tanks and<br/>Crave gets slaked</p></blockquote><p>They could work together, maybe even try marriage again, but both of them know it wouldn&rsquo;t last because there are too many ambitions and lusts and powerplays going on, not necessarily just within them but around them.</p><blockquote><p>My mind has changed<br/>My body&rsquo;s frame but god I like it<br/>My hearts aflame<br/>My body&rsquo;s strained but god I like it</p></blockquote><p>Sansa has become stronger and smarter, she&rsquo;s changed and it&rsquo;s been hard and it&rsquo;s still hard, but she likes it.</p><blockquote><p>Gonna teach you tricks that&rsquo;ll blow your<br/>Mongrel mind<br/>Baby doll I recognize<br/>You&rsquo;re a hideous thing inside<br/>If ever there were a lucky kind it&rsquo;s<br/>You you you you</p></blockquote><p>She recognizes his flaws, where she can manipulate him now because she learned from Cersei and Littlefinger, and she knows that it wasn&rsquo;t just his brains that got him this far, but he&rsquo;s had luck help him too. Of course, Tyrion is not a &ldquo;hideous thing inside&rdquo; and I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s how Sansa sees him, but this whole section is how she manipulated him, how she used him, because she did. It&rsquo;s about her being able to manipulate him as Cersei and Littlefinger taught her. The only truly hideous characters inside left this season were Euron and Cersei and none of the Starks would have interacted with them to fit this song; that was just one part of the song that was definitely metaphorical.</p><blockquote><p>Writhing under your riding hood</p></blockquote><p>I just think that the reference to &ldquo;riding hood&rdquo; was a key to this being about Sansa with the immediate jump to &ldquo;red&rdquo; from that phrase and Sansa&rsquo;s red hair.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kanyewest/power.html\">POWER - Kanye West</a></h2><p>The best I can make of this is that it&rsquo;s about Sansa getting through all that she has been through to be in control where she is and she&rsquo;s now determined that one person is not going to be in power of all of them, especially not the North. </p><blockquote><p>Rumble young man, rumble<br/>Life is a trip so sometimes we gon&rsquo; stumble<br/>You gotta go through pain in order to become you<br/>But once the world numbs you, you&rsquo;ll feel like it&rsquo;s only one you<br/>Man, you got the power to do anything you want to<br/>Until you ask yourself, &ldquo;Is that what it&rsquo;s all come to?&rdquo;<br/>Looking at life through sunglasses in the sunroof<br/>Do you have the power to get out from up under you<br/>Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you</p></blockquote><p>I could be totally and absolutely wrong with this one.\u00a0</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/fear-let-s-have-a-war-lyrics-mvjxsgz.html\">Let\u2019s Have a War - Fear</a></h2><p>Cersei&rsquo;s perspective re: the battle of King\u2019s Landing.</p><blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s so many of us<br/>There&rsquo;s so many of us<br/>There&rsquo;s so many<br/>There&rsquo;s so many of us<br/>There&rsquo;s so many of us<br/>There&rsquo;s so many</p><p>Let&rsquo;s have a war<br/>So you can go and die<br/>Let&rsquo;s have a war<br/>We could all use the money</p><p>Let&rsquo;s have a war<br/>We need the space<br/>Let&rsquo;s have a war<br/>Clean out this place</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/tune-yards-powa-lyrics-rzhqcx7.html\">Powa - Tune-Yards</a>\u00a0</h2><p>Dany breaking her promise to Tyrion about burning King&rsquo;s Landing if the bells rang.</p><blockquote><p>Rebel, rebel, no<br/>Lightening dances in my head<br/>Devil, devil, whoa, oh, oh<br/>Burning steady as a motor</p><p>[&hellip;]</p><p>'Cause you bomb me with lies,<br/>humiliations everyday<br/>You bomb me so many times</p><p>I never find my way<br/>Come on and bomb me<br/>Why won&rsquo;t you bomb me?<br/>Come on and bomb<br/>Go on and whoa</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/van-morrison-listen-to-the-lion-lyrics-nsv5jl5.html\">Listen to the Lion - Van Morrison</a></h2><p>The first half of this just screams the end of Jaime and Cersei:</p><blockquote><p>And all my love come down<br/>All my love come tumblin&rsquo; down<br/>All my love come tumblin&rsquo; down<br/>All my love come tumblin&rsquo; down<br/>Oh, listen listen<br/>To the lion<br/>Oh, listen listen listen<br/>To the lion&hellip;<br/>Inside of me<br/>Oh, oh, oh</p><p>And I shall search my soul<br/>I shall search my very soul<br/>And I shall search my very soul<br/>I shall search my very so-o-oul</p><p>For the lion<br/>For the lion<br/>For the lion<br/>For the lion&hellip;<br/>Inside of me<br/>Oh, oh, yeah</p><p>And all my tears have flown<br/>All my tears like water flown</p></blockquote><p>Right? That&rsquo;s their end. Things literally came tumbling down on them, the lion inside Cersei, the Lannister sigil is the Lion, she&rsquo;s pregnant with their last child. All tears have flown because they gonna die, can&rsquo;t cry no more, right? So, obviously this song is about the end of Jaime and Cersei, except&hellip; for the next part of the song.</p><blockquote><p>And we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br/>And we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br/>And we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br/>&hellip; sailed to Caledonia</p><p>And we sailed, and we sailed,<br/>And we sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br/>Away from Denmark<br/>Way up to Caledonia<br/>Away from Denmark<br/>Way up to Caledonia</p><p>And we sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br/>All around the World<br/>And we sailed&hellip;, and we sailed&hellip;, and we sailed&hellip;<br/>Looking for a brand new start</p></blockquote><p>(They sailed to a few more places, but you get the point.) So, clearly Jaime and Cersei aren&rsquo;t doing that&hellip; unless, they did somehow escape those tumbling rocks and we&rsquo;ll see them in the final episode, then, yeah, this song *is* about them. If not and they do be dead and gone, then, well, yeah, I could see this song being about Ser Brienne of Tarth. Because the first part of the song would totally fit her too&hellip; if she, like Cersei, had a Jaime Lannister Lion inside her. Uh huh.</p><p>We shall see. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/cage-the-elephant-cold-cold-cold-lyrics-h8tfkj4.html\">Cold Cold Cold - Cage the Elephants</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;m thinking this one&rsquo;s about Jon and his conflict over his identity, because\u00a0first off we start early on with this line:</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been breathing air but there&rsquo;s no sign of life</p></blockquote><p>Jon, technically, isn&rsquo;t alive, being a fire wight and all, so, I&rsquo;m just saying.</p><blockquote><p>Tell me how hard will I fall if I live a double life</p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow / Aegon Targaryen. Uh huh.</p><blockquote><p>And as the darkness falls it fills up both my eyes<br/>My life before me like a flash in the night<br/>With my arms open wide</p><p>Well it&rsquo;s cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br/>Cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br/>Cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br/>Doctor can you help me cause something don&rsquo;t feel right<br/>Something don&rsquo;t feel right, something just ain&rsquo;t right</p></blockquote><p>He found out all of this right before the Long Night.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/queens-of-the-stone-age-no-one-knows-lyrics-qtbj71l.html\">No One Knows - Queens of the Stone Age</a></h2><p>This is absolutely about Arya and the whole the Hound=Death and Gendry=Life theory.</p><blockquote><p>And I realize you\u2019re mine<br/>Indeed a fool am I<br/>And I realize you\u2019re mine<br/>Indeed a fool am I<br/>Ahh</p></blockquote><p>Gendry proposed, offered himself to her, asked her to be with him&hellip; and she totes is gonna realize that she was a fool because he is hers.</p><blockquote><p>Heaven smiles above me<br/>What a gift here below<br/>But no one knows<br/>A gift that you give to me<br/>No one knows</p></blockquote><p>The Hound gave Arya a gift, he made her realize that it&rsquo;s time to LIVE her life, instead of dying everyday just waiting for death. Once upon a time, Arya was No One. Yuppers.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/biffyclyro/wolvesofwinter.html\">Wolves of Winter - Biffy Clyro</a></h2><p>This has got to be Sansa giving some straight talk to Dany.</p><blockquote><p>Justify your reasons, now it is my turn<br/>We are the wolves!<br/>How&rsquo;s it gonna feel when there&rsquo;s no one to support ya?<br/>How&rsquo;s it gonna feel when you&rsquo;re standing there alone?</p><p>We have achieved so much more than you possibly thought we could<br/>(I love that you&rsquo;re seething)<br/>You can achieve anything, just remember no I in team<br/>(But there&rsquo;s two in brilliant)<br/>We are the wolves of winter<br/>We live in a kingdom of blood</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nothingmore/gotowar.html\">Go to War - Nothing More</a></h2><p>Dany to Jon episode 04 is what this is feels like this is referencing.</p><blockquote><p>Screaming at the ones we love<br/>Like we forgot who we can trust<br/>Screaming at the top of our lungs<br/>On the grounds where we feel safe<br/>Do we feel safe?<br/>Do we feel safe?</p></blockquote><p>She&rsquo;s lost so many people and feels like those she has she can&rsquo;t completely trust. She doesn&rsquo;t feel safe.</p><blockquote><p>Hush, my baby, make no sound<br/>Maybe we can wait each other out<br/>It&rsquo;s a cold war<br/>Let&rsquo;s go to war</p><p>With every settled score<br/>I thought that fighting with meant fighting for<br/>But you turn it around<br/>But you turn it around<br/>(War, war, war!)</p></blockquote><p>She doesn&rsquo;t feel she has anyone completely on her side anymore.</p><blockquote><p>Every feeling in my bones<br/>Tells me to lash out and tell you to fuck off<br/>You&rsquo;ve got my heart and I&rsquo;ve got your soul<br/>But are we better off alone?<br/>With every battle we lose a little more<br/>Remember everything that we&rsquo;d die for<br/>You are everything that I&rsquo;d die for</p></blockquote><p>Dany still loves and wants Jon, but Jon no longer can love her like *that.* And Dany keeps losing more and more with every battle, and she hasn&rsquo;t forgotten what she&rsquo;s fighting and what everyone that she loves has died for.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/royalblood/littlemonster.html\">Little Monster - Royal Blood</a></h2><p>I think this one is about Jon taking on Tyrion.</p><blockquote><p>Hey little monster, I got my eye on you<br/>Where are you going, where you running to?<br/>Hey little monster, you know it&rsquo;s all ok<br/>I&rsquo;m gonna love you, no matter what you say</p></blockquote><p>I think this may be about Jon and Tyrion trying to come to terms with what Dany is doing before they part ways on how to deal with her IF my speculation is correct that Tyrion winds up killing her to protect the realm. And then from that point on, things change between Jon and Tyrion. The next part of the song is more about Jon&rsquo;s feelings for Dany and how Tyrion is going to see the Wolf in Jon Snow.</p><blockquote><p>I got love on my fingers<br/>Lust on my tongue<br/>You say you got nothing,<br/>So come out and get some<br/>Heartache to Heartache,<br/>I&rsquo;m your wolf- I&rsquo;m your man<br/>I say run little monster,<br/>Before you know who I am</p></blockquote><p>Jon had Daenerys&rsquo; love and Tyrion didn\u2019t. Tyrion took Dany out to protect the realm and Jon understands that it came from a place from honor and that Tyrion loved Dany, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, Jon is going to show avenge her.</p><p>I could be totes wrong, though. We&rsquo;ll find out tomorrow!</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thrice/burnthefleet.html\">Burn the Fleet - Thrice</a></h2><p>This is the first attack on King\u2019s Landing.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/prince/sister.html\">Sister - Prince</a></h2><p>Uhm, yeah, just read the lyrics. It doesn&rsquo;t perfectly describe their situation, but it&rsquo;s the overall tenor and theme.

So many screams that she has listened to, and we all know that temptation has taken over, no more control, rationale is gone.</p><blockquote><p>Empty eyes enslave the creations<br/>Of placid faces and lifeless pageants<br/>In the depths of a mind insane<br/>Fantasy and reality are the same</p></blockquote><p>The coin has landed on the side of insanity.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/danzig-killer-wolf-lyrics-h4qjmj7.html\">Killer Wolf - Danzig</a></h2><p>Arya and her awesome power, as a killer, as a woman (see: one smitten Gendry err <strike>Rivers</strike> Baratheon).</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019m the wolf<br/>I\u2019m the one you want<br/>I\u2019m the killer wolf<br/>I\u2019m 'onna pound you home<br/>I\u2019m the wolf<br/>Howlin\u2019 all night<br/>I curl up next to you<br/>When you\u2019re all alone</p></blockquote><p>How her deadly abilities, her killer ways have become so much a part of who she is.</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019m the wolf<br/>Howlin\u2019 all night<br/>I\u2019m the king wolf<br/>I put the chill in your bones<br/>I\u2019m the wolf<br/>Hunting you down<br/>I ain\u2019t no back door wolf<br/>I don\u2019t scratch at no doors</p></blockquote><p>She has no fear, she\u2019s in control, and numb to the world in generally for the most part.</p><blockquote><p>Just one kiss, yes<br/>From my lips<br/>Rake your soul<br/>Over burning coals<br/>Just one touch, yes<br/>From my love<br/>Make you howl<br/>'Til the sun comes up<br/>I\u2019m the wolf</p></blockquote><p>And how with a few well-placed comments, eyebrow lifts, sultry looks and deadly knife throws gets Gendry all hot and bothered like that. Boy&rsquo;s just gone for her. In the immortal words of Joe Dempsie, he&rsquo;s spruuuung!</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/atreyu-the-time-is-now-lyrics-vhshqv6.html\">The Time Is Now - Atreyu</a></h2><p>I just can&rsquo;t see this being about anything other than Arya after episode 05 being ready to start a new life&ndash;one that is not about death. And since I firmly believe that the Hound=Death, and Gendry=life, and both are crazy entangled up with Arya this season, that therefore means the new life she starts will be with Gendry.</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been dreaming 'bout, hope for better days<br/>Time for dreaming&rsquo;s done, time to face the sun</p><p>(Flying high above the world)<br/>It&rsquo;s a new life, it&rsquo;s a new mind<br/>And I will never fall</p></blockquote><p>Arya rode away on that white horse, flying high and you know she will not fall. It&rsquo;s just too hopeful and happy to be about Daenerys.</p><blockquote><p>(The time is now)<br/>I can&rsquo;t contain myself, I never felt so alive<br/>(The time is now)<br/>I&rsquo;m past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I never felt so alive&hellip;&rdquo; For the first time, Arya has given herself permission to live.</p><blockquote><p>(Hey-ay, hey-ay, hey-ay, yeah)<br/>The time is now!</p></blockquote><p>Yup, the time is now.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.songlyrics.com/the-blue-stones/be-my-fire-lyrics/\">Be My Fire - The Blue Stones</a></h2><p>Dany wanting so much for Jon to still love her as his love, wanting him to trust her, to be true to her, to be with her forever.</p><blockquote><p>Baby, be my fire<br/>Baby, be my flame<br/>Baby, be the softly burning embers</p><p>You need a man in whom<br/>You can depend<br/>Well I&rsquo;d be the gasoline<br/>To keep you alive<br/>And I&rsquo;d be the cold<br/>So unbreakable<br/>We&rsquo;d burn together<br/>Straight through the night<br/>That&rsquo;s alright<br/>Baby, be my fire</p></blockquote><p>Yes, it says &ldquo;man,&rdquo; but eh, the point still gets across. I think this is about them. I think.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/black-flag-rise-above-lyrics-9b7hfjq.html\">Rise Above - Black Flag</a></h2><p>I think this is about Sansa and representing the North wanting their independence back.</p><blockquote><p>we are tired of your abuse<br/>try to stop us but its no use</p><p>societys arm&rsquo;s out of control<br/>rise above we&rsquo;re gonna rise above<br/>think there smart cant think for themselves<br/>rise above we&rsquo;re gonna rise above<br/>laugh at us behind our backs<br/>rise above we&rsquo;re gonna rise above<br/>i find satisfaction in what they lack<br/>rise above we&rsquo;re gonna rise above</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/40984/\">Alternative Ulster - Stiff Little Fingers</a></h2><p>I had no clue what this song was about\u2026 I had to go to Song Meanings since I\u2019m not from Ireland and don\u2019t know much about the politics, the Punk Rock scen or the political dynamics going on there. The bottom line is that this song is about seeing beyond the divisions. Therefore, this song\u2026 is Jon\u2019s point of view. We all are in this together: The Living against the Undead.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/born_ruffians/this_sentence_will_ruinsave_your_life-lyrics-1135073.html\">This Sentence Will Ruin/Save Your Life - Young Ruffians</a></h2><p>This whole song is about someone trying to figure things out. It\u2019s about someone who frankly knows nothing\u2026 so, uhm, yeah, Jon Snow, and his identity crisis and trying to figure out what the fuck to do.</p><blockquote><p>I need to know who I am<br/>and what I&rsquo;m going to do while I&rsquo;m on earth<br/>I need to understand<br/>everything and everybody&rsquo;s lives</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-pogues-the-sick-bed-of-cuchulainn-lyrics-vn93g59.html\">The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn - The Pogues</a></h2><p>This one\u2019s about Tyrion\u2026 the song is very Celtic with lots of history about the people. Basically, it&rsquo;s about the urge to self-destruct and about a man&rsquo;s life-long descent into alcoholism. SO, yeah, Tyrion.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/neil-young-winterlong-lyrics-hgfg4d1.html\">Winterlong - Neil Young</a></h2><p>Well, this certainly seems to apply to Gendry after Arya turned down his proposal. Very promising though is the fact that nothing in the song is definite. It was all \u201cif\u2026\u201d \u201cyou seem to be\u2026\u201d</p><blockquote><p>I waited for you, Winterlong<br/>You seem to be where I belong.<br/>It&rsquo;s all illusion anyway.</p></blockquote><p>\u201cYou seem&hellip;\u201d that leaves it to open, the possibility of her coming back is not closed off. The &ldquo;illusion&rdquo; could refer to the title and castle.</p><blockquote><p>If things should ever turn out wrong<br/>And all the love we have is gone,<br/>It won&rsquo;t be easy on that day.</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;If&rdquo; and &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be easy <b>on that day</b>&rdquo; makes it clear he hasn&rsquo;t given up, he&rsquo;s still waiting for his girl to come to him.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/blitzen-trapper-furr-lyrics-n5562tm.html\">Furr - Blitzen Trapper</a></h2><p>OK, guys, this is it. I know I keep saying it, but yeah, Arya and Gendry? Are absolutely endgame. This song sounds absolutely like Arya deciding to give up her Stark-ways, being the killer with a list, etc. and joining Gendry. I mean, for reals! I&rsquo;m just putting all the lyrics here bolding key phrases.</p><blockquote><p>Yeah, when I was only 17,<br/><b>I could hear the angels whispering</b><br/>So I droned into the words and<br/>Wondered aimlessly about till<br/>I<b> heard my mother shouting through the fog<br/>It turned out to be the howling of a dog<br/>Or a wolf to be exact.<br/>The sound sent shivers down my back<br/>But I was drawn into the pack.</b><br/>And before long, they allowed me<br/>To join in and sing their song.<br/>So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah<br/>We would gladly get our fill,<br/>Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn.<br/><b>And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong.<br/>For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah<br/>And my thoughts, they surely were turned to<br/>Instinct and obedience to God.</b></p><p>[Chorus]<br/>You can wear your fur<br/>Like the river on fire.<br/>But you better be sure<br/>If you\u2019re makin&rsquo; God a liar.<br/>I&rsquo;m a rattlesnake, babe,<br/>I&rsquo;m like fuel on fire.<br/>So if you&rsquo;re gonna&rsquo; get made,<br/>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of what you&rsquo;ve learned.</p><p>On the day that I turned 23,<br/><b>I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree.<br/>When suddenly a girl</b><br/>With skin the color of a pearl,<br/><b>Wandered aimlessly,<br/>But she didn&rsquo;t seem to see.<br/>She was listenin&rsquo; for the angels just like me.</b><br/><b>So I stood and looked about.<br/>I brushed the leaves off of my snout.<br/>And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees.<br/>You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees.<br/>So I took her by the arm<br/>We settled down upon a farm.<br/>And raised our children up as<br/>Gently as you pleased.</b></p><p><b>And now my fur has turned to skin.<br/>And I&rsquo;ve been quickly ushered in<br/>To a world that I confess I do not know.<br/>But I still dream of running careless through the snow.</b><br/>An&rsquo; through the howlin&rsquo; winds that blow,<br/>Across the ancient distant flow,<br/>It fill our bodies up like water till we know.</p><p>[Chorus]</p></blockquote><p>OK, now aside from the very, very obviousness of the fact that if you switch the genders&ndash;which, when a song THIS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATES Arya and Gendry&rsquo;s story with references to wolves and packs and settling in a farm (forest lass), etc. one can not worry about the gender not matching perfectly&ndash;there&rsquo;s another very key thing one has to bear in mind.\u00a0</p><p>The song is called &ldquo;Furr.&rdquo; That title clearly references the narrator (who in this case would be Arya) being a wolf. The group name is Blitzen Trapper. Blitzen is, of course, famously known as one of the reindeer who pulled Santa&rsquo;s sleigh. While science has now proven that all of Santa&rsquo;s reindeer were likely female as male reindeer shed their antlers in December, it is highly unlikely that when the tale was first told that such was known therefore we&rsquo;re going with the original conception that Blitzen is indeed male. And since Blitzen is known as a male reindeer, well, another name for a male deer is a&hellip; stag. So, not only does the song itself alone scream an Arya and Gendrya endgame (it really, really, REALLY does). </p><p>The group name + the song title + the meaning of the song = <b>The Stag caught the Wolf with his love. \u00a0</b></p><p>At this point, let me remind ya&rsquo;ll that Benioff and Weiss said about this playlist, &ldquo;The answer to the ending is one hundred percent hidden in the playlist choices. No one will believe us, but it\u2019s true.&rdquo; Uh huh. I believe you!</p><h2>Power - AJ Ghent\u00a0</h2><p>There are no lyrics for this one, so I just listened to it and really, I think it might be the beginning of the season when Dany was feeling confident about taking on the Army of the Dead and Cersei. OR it could be Cersei feeling confident about taking on Dany with her greater numbers. It\u2019s easier to analyze it when you can look at the lyrics. :shrugs:</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/system-of-a-down-toxicity-lyrics-hd7dncz.html\">Toxicity - System of a Down</a></h2><p>This song is really about nature being corrupted and capitalism taking over the world, so all I can really take from it is in relation to the endgame that it&rsquo;s Sansa and her opinion of Dany and how she thinks that she is a conqueror set on taking over Westeros by any means necessary.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/papa-roach-born-for-greatness-lyrics-66ngfhd.html\">Born For Greatness - Papa Roach</a></h2><p>Oh, my heart. I think this is about Varys, whom I\u2019ve always loved. He&rsquo;s my fave character in the whole series.</p><blockquote><p>I am a man at war<br/>And I am fighting for<br/>All of the broken people<br/>All of the people thrown overboard<br/>They always tried to shame us<br/>But they don&rsquo;t speak our language<br/>No, we&rsquo;re not nameless, we&rsquo;re not faceless<br/>We were born for greatness</p></blockquote><p>Yup, and he fought all the way to the end.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/yeah-yeah-yeahs-gold-lion-lyrics-7s4kw7d.html\">Gold Lion - Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>\u00a0</h2><p>I could be totally wrong, but all I can think here is Cersei\u2019s downfall and her and Jaime\u2019s death although he tried to rescue her.</p><blockquote><p>Gold lion&rsquo;s gonna tell me where the light is,<br/>Gold lion&rsquo;s gonna tell me where the light is,<br/>Take our hands out of control,<br/>Take our hands out of control</p><p>Now, tell me what you saw,<br/>Tell me what you saw,<br/>There was a crowd of seeds,<br/>Inside, outside,<br/>I must have done a dozen each</p><p>It was the height I threw, the weight,<br/>The shell was crushing you,<br/>I&rsquo;ve been around a few</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-thermals-here-s-your-future-lyrics-8x2jq48.html\">Here\u2019s Your Future - The Thermals</a></h2><p>There\u2019s gonna be a lot of death and destruction and people are going to pay for their sins, and someone is going to be sacrificed for sins that they did not commit, maybe not in death, but that person won\u2019t be happy. And I think that person will be Jon.</p><blockquote><p>God reached his hand down from the sky<br/>He flooded the land and he set it afire<br/>He said fear me again and know I&rsquo;m your father<br/>And remember that no one can breathe underwater</p></blockquote><p>The deaths Dany caused, Theon&rsquo;s death, all the Ironborn deaths, including Euron&rsquo;s mens&rsquo; deaths.</p><blockquote><p>God told his son it&rsquo;s time to come home<br/>I promise you won&rsquo;t have to die all alone<br/>I need you to pay for the sins I create<br/>Son said I will but dad I&rsquo;m afraid</p></blockquote><p>Jon&rsquo;s no Jesus, but he&rsquo;s the closest thing to a sacrificial lamb this show has. He&rsquo;s already died once and risen for the sins of others.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/u2-love-is-blindness-lyrics-h7k29dm.html\">Love is Blindness - U2</a></h2><p>Dany and Jon. Period.</p><blockquote><p>Love is blindness<br/>I don&rsquo;t want to see<br/>Won&rsquo;t you wrap the night<br/>Around me<br/>Oh my heart<br/>Love is blindness</p></blockquote><p>They don&rsquo;t want to know what they know about Jon&rsquo;s parentage. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. It changed everything for them.</p><hr><p>And that\u2019s all she wrote. Agree, disagree&hellip; thoughts? I\u2019d really like to know what other people think.</p>",

And yet, she\u2019s so surrounded, covered, engulfed in death that she\u2019s unclean.</p><blockquote><p>See she comes<br>Blacker than pitch<br>Have to make this fallen bitch<br>All I want<br>All I crave<br>Demoness calls<br>The bitch is come<br>For those who wait<br>Cross the breach in hell<br>See she is<br>Bedeviled with breasts<br>Enchantment on legs</p></blockquote><p>This stanza here even fits her if you take into account the fact that the Hound calls her a bitch all the time, and the last two lines, well, we do see Arya as a woman for the first time this season. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/led-zeppelin-immigrant-song-lyrics-lvxdt1w.html\">Immigrant Song (Remaster) - Led Zeppelin</a></h2><p>\n\nThe Army of the Undead want to take over Westeros.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-doors-end-lyrics-pr4s3dw.html\">The End (Remaster) - The Doors</a></h2><p>The could certainly be about Jaime and Cersei, but something about it just says the Hound and Arya to me because of a line in the final stanza: \u201cYou\u2019ll never follow me\u201d and that obviously does not apply to the twins. Plus, there is a reference to a \u201cStranger\u201d in the song. The Hound\u2019s horse was \u201cStranger\u201d and, of course, as has been established this season, the Hound=death and in the faith of the Seven, the Stranger represents death.</p><blockquote><p>This is the end<br>Beautiful friend<br>This is the end<br>My only friend</p><p>The end<br>Of our elaborate plans<br>The end<br>Of everything that stands<br>The end<br>No safety or surprise<br>The end<br>I\u2019ll never look into your eyes<br>Again</p><p>Can you picture what will be<br>So limitless and free<br>Desperately in need of some stranger\u2019s hand<br>In a desperate land</p></blockquote><p>Arya is the Hound\u2019s only friend, and in many ways, he\u2019s Arya\u2019s only friend now that Gendry has become something more. It\u2019s the end of their journey together. </p><p>There is this stanza which is why one could think it references Jaime and Cersei with the references to father, brother and sister:</p><blockquote><p>The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on<br>He took a face from the ancient gallery<br>And he walked on down the hall<br>He went into the room where his sister lived, and\u2026then he<br>Paid a visit to his brother, and then he<br>He walked on down the hall, and<br>And he came to a door\u2026and he looked inside<br>\u201cFather?\u201d \u201cYes, son.\u201d \u201cI want to kill you.\u201d<br>\u201cMother, I want to\u2026\u201d</p></blockquote><p>But I took that as more allegorical, the Hound being the killer who is ready to finally kill his family, i.e., his brother. </p><p>And then we come to the end of the song and it is full of profanity after profanity, the Hound\u2019s calling card before leading to death and then those lines that just scream the Hound to Arya.</p><blockquote><p>Fuck, fuck-ah, yeah<br>Fuck<br>Fuck<br>Fuck, fuck<br>Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah<br>C'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah<br>Fuck me, baby, fuck yeah<br>Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah!<br>Fuck, yeah!

It just totally is Gendry pining for Arya. Nothing else makes sense. N-O-T-H-I-N-G!\u00a0</p><p>I know that some have tried to fit it with Sansa and Tyrion, and I love them, but it just doesn\u2019t fit them. Sansa is in no way Tyrion\u2019s true love, she just isn\u2019t. He hasn\u2019t been thinking of her throughout his time away from her. We know that. We absolutely know that. It does not fit them, sorry Sanrion fans (I\u2019m one of them).</p><p>Now, if there is some time jump that we see in episode 06 before Arya goes to Gendry (because, yes, I\u2019m still convinced that we are getting an Arya/Gendry endgame), then maybe this will apply to *that* timeframe, but as of now, I still see it as pre-season 08 Gendrya, just the feeling, the tenor and tone of it. Think of Gendry\u2019s line to her in the second episode:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>The last time you saw me, you asked me to come to Winterfell. I took the long road\u2026 </p></blockquote><p>Yeah. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/guns-n-roses-mama-kin-lyrics-fq4j59q.html\">Mama Kin (Live Version) - Guns n Roses</a></h2><p>(FYI: These are the lyrics for the live version, so they may differ slightly.)</p><p>I believe this one is about Cersei and how her life has been spent living a lie, putting on a show, but it\u2019s all just that, a show.</p><blockquote><p>losin\u2019 touch with all that\u2019s real<br>Whole lotta lover, keepin\u2019 undercover</p></blockquote><p>Cersei so often just can\u2019t face the reality of all the shit going on around her, through most of her relationship with Jaime, she kept that a secret and even kept her other lovers a secret from him. </p><blockquote><p>You\u2019ve been fadin\u2019, always out paradin\u2019</p></blockquote><p>Cersei has always been hiding who she really is, pretending to be the perfect queen, the perfect wife, perfect mother.</p><blockquote><p>Spittin\u2019 fire from your mouth just like a dragon</p></blockquote><p>She does incest like the Targaryens. She\u2019s crazy like the Targaryens, but she\u2019s not a Targaryen. </p><blockquote><p>You better check it out \u2018cause someday soon<br>You\u2019ll have to climb back on the wagon</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not going to last, she\u2019s not going to get her happy ending. (Duh.)</p><blockquote><p>It ain\u2019t easy livin\u2019 like you want to</p></blockquote><p>She became the queen, the ruler of the seven kingdoms, but NOTHING has come easy and it\u2019s still hard for and she never had peace or happiness.</p><blockquote><p>And workin\u2019 for daddy\u2019s such a drag<br>You still stuff your mouth With his beans</p></blockquote><p>She as always under Twyin\u2019s control, she hated it, but she was always under his thumb, always playing by his rules.</p><p>This was all about Cersei not being good enough, wanting more, but never getting it, giving up everything and never getting it. She should have cherished what mattered, but she didn\u2019t and lost everything consequently.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitestripes/sevennationarmy.html\">Seven Nation Army - The White Stripes\u00a0</a></h2><p>Dany as Mad Queen. Now, this could have been about Cersei, but there\u2019s a line that screams treason, so\u2026 Dany.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI\u2019m gonna fight \u2018em off<br>A seven nation army couldn\u2019t hold me back<br>They\u2019re gonna rip it off<br><b>Taking their time right behind my back</b><br>And I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to myself at night<br>Because I can\u2019t forget<br>Back and forth through my mind\n\n<br></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blackkeys/howlinforyou.html\">Howlin For You - The Black Keys</a></h2><p>\n\nThis is so obviously Gendry about Arya that they might as well have revealed it as such after episode 02 in the \u201cInside the Episode\u201d video.\n\n<br></p><blockquote><p>I must admit<br>I can\u2019t explain<br>Any of these thoughts racing<br>Through my brain</p><p>It\u2019s true<br>Baby I\u2019m howlin\u2019 for you</p><p>Can\u2019t you see<br>Little girl\u2019s<br>Got a hold on me</p><p>Like glue<br>Baby I\u2019m howlin\u2019 for you</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/grandson/war.html\">War - Grandson</a>\u00a0</h2><p>Pretty clearly about the war against the Undead.</p><h2><a href=\"https://genius.com/Des-rocs-let-me-live-let-me-die-lyrics\">Let Me Live/Let Me Die - Des Rocs</a></h2><p>Arya again, specifically with Beric sacrificing himself to save her and then her going to kill the Night King.</p><blockquote><p>I know pain, I know dread<br>Wicked veins, they turn to lead<br>Tears don\u2019t stop the fire<br>It\u2019s killing time</p><p>Back from the dead<br>See, their eyes got nothing left<br>Kiss me, I am the cobra<br>It\u2019s killing time</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://lyricstranslate.com/en/flugufrelsarinn-flys-savior.html-0\">Flugufrelsarinn - Sigur Ros</a></h2><p>This was in another language, I read the translation and I\u2019m so not sure, but I\u2019m thinking maybe Grey Worm and Missandei\u2026</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tommorello/cantstopthebleeding.html\">Can\u2019t Stop The Bleeding - Tom Morello feat. Gary Clark Jr. and Gramatik</a></h2><p>I think this is Tyrion realizing that Dany is not the one. Interestingly enough, prior to last week, this song was NOT on the playlist. There were only 50 songs and then, boom!, this one was added.</p><blockquote><p>Can\u2019t stop the bleeding, calling<br>Can\u2019t stop the bleeding, oh</p><p>Fill my soul, it\u2019s hard to see<br>Trouble found and trouble lost<br>20 miles dark and deep<br>Trouble paid and trouble bought, uh</p><p>Frayed like myth, every fool caught it<br>Sound like this, every fool bought it</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion was duped into believing that Daenerys was the Princess that was Promised, and I think he\u2019s going to something drastic about it.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/barns-courtney-fire-lyrics-lzk3qcl.html\">Fire - Barns Courtney</a></h2><p>Ceganebowl!</p><blockquote><p>Oh, a thousand faces staring at me<br>Thousand times I\u2019ve fallen<br>Thousand voices dead at my feet<br>Now I\u2019m gone, now I\u2019m gone, now I\u2019m gone</p><p>And my mother told me, \u201cSon, let it be.\u201d<br>Sold my soul to the calling<br>Sold my soul to a sweet melody<br>Now I\u2019m gone, now I\u2019m gone, now I\u2019m gone</p><p>Oh, gimme that fire<br>Oh, gimme that fire<br>Oh, gimme that fire<br>Burn, burn, burn</p></blockquote><p>The mother in the song is metaphorical or one could take it as the Mother of the New Gods and the Mother stands, among other things, for mercy and peace. And we all know that the Hound is not going to 'Let it be\" so it\u2019s pretty clear that this is the Hound facing his deepest fear\u2013diving headfirst into fire\u2013at the same time finally getting his soul\u2019s desire and taking out his brother.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/missio-bottom-of-the-deep-blue-sea-lyrics-fr61lsv.html\">Bottom of the Deep Blue Sea - MISSIO</a></h2><p>The pretty gross relationship between Euron and Cersei, and after episode 05, more specifically, the demise of Euron Greyjoy! (The crowd cheers!)</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pixies/waveofmutilation.html\">Wave of Mutilation - Pixies</a>\u00a0</h2><p>This one\u2019s about Theon.</p><blockquote><p>cease to resist, giving my goodbye<br>drive my car into the ocean<br>you\u2019ll think i\u2019m dead, but i sail away<br>on a wave of mutilation<br>a wave<br>wave</p><p>i\u2019ve kissed mermaids, rode the el nino<br>walked the sand with the crustaceans<br>could find my way to mariana<br>on a wave of mutilation,<br>wave of mutilation<br>wave of mutilation<br>wave</p></blockquote><p>Saying goodbye to Yara, the ocean references, \u201cWhat is dead may never die\u201d = \u201cyou\u2019ll think i\u2019m dead, but i sail away,\u201d the mutilation\" theme. \u00a0Yeah, good ole Theon.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/tv-on-the-radio-wolf-like-me-lyrics-w66mmbn.html\">Wolf Like Me - TV On the Radio</a></h2><p>I think this is about Sansa to Tyrion, using him to get to Dany.</p><blockquote><p>Say<br>Say my playmate<br>Won\u2019t you lay your hands on me<br>Mirror my malady<br>Transfer my tragedy</p></blockquote><p>\u201cPlaymate\u201d as in someone who is playing the 'game\u2019 with her, and the final two lines, the two of them sharing their fears, their miseries, knowing what the other has been through.</p><blockquote><p>We could jet in a stolen car<br>But I bet we wouldn\u2019t get too far<br>Before the transformation takes<br>And bloodlust tanks and<br>Crave gets slaked</p></blockquote><p>They could work together, maybe even try marriage again, but both of them know it wouldn\u2019t last because there are too many ambitions and lusts and powerplays going on, not necessarily just within them but around them.</p><blockquote><p>My mind has changed<br>My body\u2019s frame but god I like it<br>My hearts aflame<br>My body\u2019s strained but god I like it</p></blockquote><p>Sansa has become stronger and smarter, she\u2019s changed and it\u2019s been hard and it\u2019s still hard, but she likes it.</p><blockquote><p>Gonna teach you tricks that\u2019ll blow your<br>Mongrel mind<br>Baby doll I recognize<br>You\u2019re a hideous thing inside<br>If ever there were a lucky kind it\u2019s<br>You you you you</p></blockquote><p>She recognizes his flaws, where she can manipulate him now because she learned from Cersei and Littlefinger, and she knows that it wasn\u2019t just his brains that got him this far, but he\u2019s had luck help him too. Of course, Tyrion is not a \u201chideous thing inside\u201d and I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s how Sansa sees him, but this whole section is how she manipulated him, how she used him, because she did. It\u2019s about her being able to manipulate him as Cersei and Littlefinger taught her. The only truly hideous characters inside left this season were Euron and Cersei and none of the Starks would have interacted with them to fit this song; that was just one part of the song that was definitely metaphorical.</p><blockquote><p>Writhing under your riding hood</p></blockquote><p>I just think that the reference to \u201criding hood\u201d was a key to this being about Sansa with the immediate jump to \u201cred\u201d from that phrase and Sansa\u2019s red hair.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kanyewest/power.html\">POWER - Kanye West</a></h2><p>The best I can make of this is that it\u2019s about Sansa getting through all that she has been through to be in control where she is and she\u2019s now determined that one person is not going to be in power of all of them, especially not the North. </p><blockquote><p>Rumble young man, rumble<br>Life is a trip so sometimes we gon\u2019 stumble<br>You gotta go through pain in order to become you<br>But once the world numbs you, you\u2019ll feel like it\u2019s only one you<br>Man, you got the power to do anything you want to<br>Until you ask yourself, \u201cIs that what it\u2019s all come to?\u201d<br>Looking at life through sunglasses in the sunroof<br>Do you have the power to get out from up under you<br>Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you</p></blockquote><p>I could be totally and absolutely wrong with this one.\u00a0</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/fear-let-s-have-a-war-lyrics-mvjxsgz.html\">Let\u2019s Have a War - Fear</a></h2><p>Cersei\u2019s perspective re: the battle of King\u2019s Landing.</p><blockquote><p>There\u2019s so many of us<br>There\u2019s so many of us<br>There\u2019s so many<br>There\u2019s so many of us<br>There\u2019s so many of us<br>There\u2019s so many</p><p>Let\u2019s have a war<br>So you can go and die<br>Let\u2019s have a war<br>We could all use the money</p><p>Let\u2019s have a war<br>We need the space<br>Let\u2019s have a war<br>Clean out this place</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/tune-yards-powa-lyrics-rzhqcx7.html\">Powa - Tune-Yards</a>\u00a0</h2><p>Dany breaking her promise to Tyrion about burning King\u2019s Landing if the bells rang.</p><blockquote><p>Rebel, rebel, no<br>Lightening dances in my head<br>Devil, devil, whoa, oh, oh<br>Burning steady as a motor</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>'Cause you bomb me with lies,<br>humiliations everyday<br>You bomb me so many times</p><p>I never find my way<br>Come on and bomb me<br>Why won\u2019t you bomb me?<br>Come on and bomb<br>Go on and whoa</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/van-morrison-listen-to-the-lion-lyrics-nsv5jl5.html\">Listen to the Lion - Van Morrison</a></h2><p>The first half of this just screams the end of Jaime and Cersei:</p><blockquote><p>And all my love come down<br>All my love come tumblin\u2019 down<br>All my love come tumblin\u2019 down<br>All my love come tumblin\u2019 down<br>Oh, listen listen<br>To the lion<br>Oh, listen listen listen<br>To the lion\u2026<br>Inside of me<br>Oh, oh, oh</p><p>And I shall search my soul<br>I shall search my very soul<br>And I shall search my very soul<br>I shall search my very so-o-oul</p><p>For the lion<br>For the lion<br>For the lion<br>For the lion\u2026<br>Inside of me<br>Oh, oh, yeah</p><p>And all my tears have flown<br>All my tears like water flown</p></blockquote><p>Right? That\u2019s their end. Things literally came tumbling down on them, the lion inside Cersei, the Lannister sigil is the Lion, she\u2019s pregnant with their last child. All tears have flown because they gonna die, can\u2019t cry no more, right? So, obviously this song is about the end of Jaime and Cersei, except\u2026 for the next part of the song.</p><blockquote><p>And we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>And we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>And we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>\u2026 sailed to Caledonia</p><p>And we sailed, and we sailed,<br>And we sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>Away from Denmark<br>Way up to Caledonia<br>Away from Denmark<br>Way up to Caledonia</p><p>And we sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>All around the World<br>And we sailed\u2026, and we sailed\u2026, and we sailed\u2026<br>Looking for a brand new start</p></blockquote><p>(They sailed to a few more places, but you get the point.) So, clearly Jaime and Cersei aren\u2019t doing that\u2026 unless, they did somehow escape those tumbling rocks and we\u2019ll see them in the final episode, then, yeah, this song *is* about them. If not and they do be dead and gone, then, well, yeah, I could see this song being about Ser Brienne of Tarth. Because the first part of the song would totally fit her too\u2026 if she, like Cersei, had a Jaime Lannister Lion inside her. Uh huh.</p><p>We shall see. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/cage-the-elephant-cold-cold-cold-lyrics-h8tfkj4.html\">Cold Cold Cold - Cage the Elephants</a></h2><p>I\u2019m thinking this one\u2019s about Jon and his conflict over his identity, because\u00a0first off we start early on with this line:</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019ve been breathing air but there\u2019s no sign of life</p></blockquote><p>Jon, technically, isn\u2019t alive, being a fire wight and all, so, I\u2019m just saying.</p><blockquote><p>Tell me how hard will I fall if I live a double life</p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow / Aegon Targaryen.

Once upon a time, Arya was No One. Yuppers.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/biffyclyro/wolvesofwinter.html\">Wolves of Winter - Biffy Clyro</a></h2><p>This has got to be Sansa giving some straight talk to Dany.</p><blockquote><p>Justify your reasons, now it is my turn<br>We are the wolves!<br>How\u2019s it gonna feel when there\u2019s no one to support ya?<br>How\u2019s it gonna feel when you\u2019re standing there alone?</p><p>We have achieved so much more than you possibly thought we could<br>(I love that you\u2019re seething)<br>You can achieve anything, just remember no I in team<br>(But there\u2019s two in brilliant)<br>We are the wolves of winter<br>We live in a kingdom of blood</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nothingmore/gotowar.html\">Go to War - Nothing More</a></h2><p>Dany to Jon episode 04 is what this is feels like this is referencing.</p><blockquote><p>Screaming at the ones we love<br>Like we forgot who we can trust<br>Screaming at the top of our lungs<br>On the grounds where we feel safe<br>Do we feel safe?<br>Do we feel safe?</p></blockquote><p>She\u2019s lost so many people and feels like those she has she can\u2019t completely trust. She doesn\u2019t feel safe.</p><blockquote><p>Hush, my baby, make no sound<br>Maybe we can wait each other out<br>It\u2019s a cold war<br>Let\u2019s go to war</p><p>With every settled score<br>I thought that fighting with meant fighting for<br>But you turn it around<br>But you turn it around<br>(War, war, war!)</p></blockquote><p>She doesn\u2019t feel she has anyone completely on her side anymore.</p><blockquote><p>Every feeling in my bones<br>Tells me to lash out and tell you to fuck off<br>You\u2019ve got my heart and I\u2019ve got your soul<br>But are we better off alone?<br>With every battle we lose a little more<br>Remember everything that we\u2019d die for<br>You are everything that I\u2019d die for</p></blockquote><p>Dany still loves and wants Jon, but Jon no longer can love her like *that.* And Dany keeps losing more and more with every battle, and she hasn\u2019t forgotten what she\u2019s fighting and what everyone that she loves has died for.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/royalblood/littlemonster.html\">Little Monster - Royal Blood</a></h2><p>I think this one is about Jon taking on Tyrion.</p><blockquote><p>Hey little monster, I got my eye on you<br>Where are you going, where you running to?<br>Hey little monster, you know it\u2019s all ok<br>I\u2019m gonna love you, no matter what you say</p></blockquote><p>I think this may be about Jon and Tyrion trying to come to terms with what Dany is doing before they part ways on how to deal with her IF my speculation is correct that Tyrion winds up killing her to protect the realm. And then from that point on, things change between Jon and Tyrion. The next part of the song is more about Jon\u2019s feelings for Dany and how Tyrion is going to see the Wolf in Jon Snow.</p><blockquote><p>I got love on my fingers<br>Lust on my tongue<br>You say you got nothing,<br>So come out and get some<br>Heartache to Heartache,<br>I\u2019m your wolf- I\u2019m your man<br>I say run little monster,<br>Before you know who I am</p></blockquote><p>Jon had Daenerys\u2019 love and Tyrion didn\u2019t. Tyrion took Dany out to protect the realm and Jon understands that it came from a place from honor and that Tyrion loved Dany, but it doesn\u2019t matter, Jon is going to show avenge her.</p><p>I could be totes wrong, though.

It\u2019s clearly about Jaime\u2019s conflict over Cersei.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gratefuldead/direwolf.html\">Dire Wolf - Grateful Dead</a></h2><p>The living the night before the Battle of Winterfell, there\u2019s just a pervasive sense of a feeling of dread the night before someone\u2019s going to die.</p><blockquote><p>the wolves are running round<br>The winter was so hard and cold<br>froze ten feet neath the ground</p><p>Don\u2019t murder me<br>I beg of you don\u2019t murder me<br>Please<br>don\u2019t murder me</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/laura-marling-devil-s-spoke-lyrics-b3jhktm.html\">Devil\u2019s Spoke - Laura Marling</a></h2><p>OK, I could be wrong, but I\u2019m thinking this is about Arya deciding to start a new life, making that conscious choice and be with Gendry.</p><blockquote><p>All of this can be broken<br>All of this can be broken<br>Hold your devil by his spoke and spin him to the ground</p></blockquote><p>Basically, this is saying that the choices you\u2019ve made can be changed and you can take your hang-up (your devil) and cast it away, pin it down.</p><blockquote><p>But the love of your life lives, but lies no more<br>And where she lay your flowers grow</p></blockquote><p>Arya is the love of Gendry\u2019s life, and she\u2019s no longer lying to herself, and one can take that second line in two ways. 1) as in his hopes grew, or 2) metaphorically, that when they lie together, she got pregnant.</p><blockquote><p>The arms are fed and the babes that wed<br>The backs that bled keeping her in tow<br>But I am your keeper<br>And I hold your face away from light<br>I am yours till they come</p></blockquote><p>The first two lines read to me like Arya\u2019s take on society\u2019s role for women that she will not be a part of it, and the last three lines are her saying that as long as they are true to who they are and each other, she is his.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/perfume-genius-queen-lyrics-22n1vnk.html\">Queen - Perfume Genius</a>\u00a0</h2><p>I can\u2019t see this as anything other than Dany as Mad Queen.</p><blockquote><p>Don\u2019t you know your queen?<br>Ripped, heaving<br>Flower bloom at my feet<br>Don\u2019t you know your queen?<br>Cracked, peeling<br>Riddled with disease<br>Don\u2019t you know me?</p><p>No family is safe<br>When I sashay</p></blockquote><p>It just gives the overall feel of insanity.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/st.-vincent-cruel-lyrics-16l7kkg.html\">Cruel - St. Vincent</a></h2><p>From Dany\u2019s perspective because the North didn\u2019t appreciate her, Westeros wasn\u2019t clamoring for her, she didn\u2019t have their love like she did in Essos.</p><blockquote><p>Bodies, can\u2019t you see what everybody wants from you?<br>For you could want that, too<br>They could take or leave you<br>So they took you, and they left you<br>How could they be casually cruel?<br>Cruel, cruel, oh</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sleighbells/crownontheground.html\">Crown on the Ground - Sleigh Bells</a></h2><p>Cersei losing everything.</p><blockquote><p>You need to know how,<br>To say you\u2019ll backtrack,<br>Between the clear bag,<br>Somewhere in your habitat,<br>You have a little thing,<br>You think you\u2019re bothering,<br>The class is ending, ending, ending,<br>You never did know,<br>You don\u2019t wanna know,<br>There\u2019s another show playing in your window,<br>The perm'nent thought of you,<br>Has never bothered you,<br>You\u2019re gonna have to, have to, have to,</p><p>Set, set that crown on the ground</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amazons/mother.html\">Mother - The Amazons</a></h2><p>Tyrion trying to fix everything he\u2019s fucked up because he still wants to believe.</p><blockquote><p>Friends want to kill me<br>But I give them all my loving anyway<br>If god won\u2019t forgive me<br>I\u2019m not the only one to make amends</p></blockquote><p>Bronn\u2019s trying to kill him. Tyrion is still trying to make amends, as is Jaime.</p><blockquote><p>Mother, it\u2019s not in my hands<br>Try to understand, it\u2019s only 'cause I can<br>Fools believe they can erase<br>All that they\u2019ve done before</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion telling the Mother\u2013as in one of the Seven\u2013that he is still trying to believe he can make up for his past sins and mistakes.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/kaleo-hot-blood-lyrics-x64xl9m.html\">Hot Blood - KALEO</a></h2><p>Jon\u2019s conflict and shame over his love for Dany, his aunt.</p><blockquote><p>You turn your back, you\u2019re a broken man<br>You come around and just dying to shake your hand<br>I don\u2019t expect you to understand<br>Just keep telling yourself there\u2019s no shame</p></blockquote><p>This was when he was still trying to convince himself it was OK, but then, of course he pulled away from their kiss.</p><blockquote><p>They don\u2019t know 'bout who we are<br>They don\u2019t know 'bout you and I<br>They ain\u2019t know 'bout the stars of your eyes<br>Oh hot blood love is gonna get ya</p></blockquote><p>Before the secret was out\u2026</p><blockquote><p>You wanna prove you\u2019re the better man<br>You wanna reach for the things that nobody can<br>Oh all you need is to break away, yeah<br>Just keep telling yourself there\u2019s no shame </p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen is a honorable man just like his real father, Ned Stark, and nothing can change that.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/black-sabbath-luke-s-wall-war-pigs-lyrics-v7l3pbn.html\">War Pigs/Luke\u2019s Wall - Black Sabbath</a></h2><p>The end of Cersei who never cared about any of her subjects.</p><blockquote><p>Politicians hide themselves away<br>They only started the war<br>Why should they go out to fight?</p></blockquote><p>Cersei until nearly the very end up there safe in her tower watching all of the bloodshed and destruction.</p><blockquote><p>They leave that role for the poor, yeah<br>Time will tell on their power minds,<br>Making war just for fun<br>Treating people just like pawns in chess,<br>Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah</p></blockquote><p>She could have helped, she knew that by playing her games, thousands and thousands of people could and would die, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><blockquote><p>Now in darkness world stops turning,<br>Ashes where the bodies burning<br>No more War Pigs have the power,<br>Hand of God has struck the hour<br>Day of judgement, God is calling<br>On their knees the war pigs crawling,<br>Begging mercies for their sins<br>Satan, laughing, spreads his wings </p></blockquote><p>The end of Cersei, ashes falling, bodies burning. Not Satan, but Drogon.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/slayer-dead-skin-mask-lyrics-55rm4dv.html\">Dead Skin Mask - Slayer</a>\u00a0</h2><p>Dany the Mad Queen, again.</p><blockquote><p>Graze the skin with my finger tips<br>The brush of dead cold flesh pacifies the means<br>Provocative images delicate features so smooth<br>A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon</p><p>Dance with the dead in my dreams<br>Listen to their hallowed screams<br>The dead have taken my soul<br>Temptation\u2019s lost all control<br>Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes<br>Lose all mind control rationale declines</p></blockquote><p>Dany\u2019s dreams with Drogo and her baby. So many screams that she has listened to, and we all know that temptation has taken over, no more control, rationale is gone.</p><blockquote><p>Empty eyes enslave the creations<br>Of placid faces and lifeless pageants<br>In the depths of a mind insane<br>Fantasy and reality are the same</p></blockquote><p>The coin has landed on the side of insanity.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/danzig-killer-wolf-lyrics-h4qjmj7.html\">Killer Wolf - Danzig</a></h2><p>Arya and her awesome power, as a killer, as a woman (see: one smitten Gendry err <strike>Rivers</strike> Baratheon).</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019m the wolf<br>I\u2019m the one you want<br>I\u2019m the killer wolf<br>I\u2019m 'onna pound you home<br>I\u2019m the wolf<br>Howlin\u2019 all night<br>I curl up next to you<br>When you\u2019re all alone</p></blockquote><p>How her deadly abilities, her killer ways have become so much a part of who she is.</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019m the wolf<br>Howlin\u2019 all night<br>I\u2019m the king wolf<br>I put the chill in your bones<br>I\u2019m the wolf<br>Hunting you down<br>I ain\u2019t no back door wolf<br>I don\u2019t scratch at no doors</p></blockquote><p>She has no fear, she\u2019s in control, and numb to the world in generally for the most part.</p><blockquote><p>Just one kiss, yes<br>From my lips<br>Rake your soul<br>Over burning coals<br>Just one touch, yes<br>From my love<br>Make you howl<br>'Til the sun comes up<br>I\u2019m the wolf</p></blockquote><p>And how with a few well-placed comments, eyebrow lifts, sultry looks and deadly knife throws gets Gendry all hot and bothered like that. Boy\u2019s just gone for her. In the immortal words of Joe Dempsie, he\u2019s spruuuung!</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/atreyu-the-time-is-now-lyrics-vhshqv6.html\">The Time Is Now - Atreyu</a></h2><p>I just can\u2019t see this being about anything other than Arya after episode 05 being ready to start a new life\u2013one that is not about death. And since I firmly believe that the Hound=Death, and Gendry=life, and both are crazy entangled up with Arya this season, that therefore means the new life she starts will be with Gendry.</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019ve been dreaming 'bout, hope for better days<br>Time for dreaming\u2019s done, time to face the sun</p><p>(Flying high above the world)<br>It\u2019s a new life, it\u2019s a new mind<br>And I will never fall</p></blockquote><p>Arya rode away on that white horse, flying high and you know she will not fall. It\u2019s just too hopeful and happy to be about Daenerys.</p><blockquote><p>(The time is now)<br>I can\u2019t contain myself, I never felt so alive<br>(The time is now)<br>I\u2019m past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire</p></blockquote><p>\u201cI never felt so alive\u2026\u201d For the first time, Arya has given herself permission to live.</p><blockquote><p>(Hey-ay, hey-ay, hey-ay, yeah)<br>The time is now!</p></blockquote><p>Yup, the time is now.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.songlyrics.com/the-blue-stones/be-my-fire-lyrics/\">Be My Fire - The Blue Stones</a></h2><p>Dany wanting so much for Jon to still love her as his love, wanting him to trust her, to be true to her, to be with her forever.</p><blockquote><p>Baby, be my fire<br>Baby, be my flame<br>Baby, be the softly burning embers</p><p>You need a man in whom<br>You can depend<br>Well I\u2019d be the gasoline<br>To keep you alive<br>And I\u2019d be the cold<br>So unbreakable<br>We\u2019d burn together<br>Straight through the night<br>That\u2019s alright<br>Baby, be my fire</p></blockquote><p>Yes, it says \u201cman,\u201d but eh, the point still gets across. I think this is about them. I think.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/black-flag-rise-above-lyrics-9b7hfjq.html\">Rise Above - Black Flag</a></h2><p>I think this is about Sansa and representing the North wanting their independence back.</p><blockquote><p>we are tired of your abuse<br>try to stop us but its no use</p><p>societys arm\u2019s out of control<br>rise above we\u2019re gonna rise above<br>think there smart cant think for themselves<br>rise above we\u2019re gonna rise above<br>laugh at us behind our backs<br>rise above we\u2019re gonna rise above<br>i find satisfaction in what they lack<br>rise above we\u2019re gonna rise above</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/40984/\">Alternative Ulster - Stiff Little Fingers</a></h2><p>I had no clue what this song was about\u2026 I had to go to Song Meanings since I\u2019m not from Ireland and don\u2019t know much about the politics, the Punk Rock scen or the political dynamics going on there. The bottom line is that this song is about seeing beyond the divisions. Therefore, this song\u2026 is Jon\u2019s point of view. We all are in this together: The Living against the Undead.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/born_ruffians/this_sentence_will_ruinsave_your_life-lyrics-1135073.html\">This Sentence Will Ruin/Save Your Life - Young Ruffians</a></h2><p>This whole song is about someone trying to figure things out. It\u2019s about someone who frankly knows nothing\u2026 so, uhm, yeah, Jon Snow, and his identity crisis and trying to figure out what the fuck to do.</p><blockquote><p>I need to know who I am<br>and what I\u2019m going to do while I\u2019m on earth<br>I need to understand<br>everything and everybody\u2019s lives</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-pogues-the-sick-bed-of-cuchulainn-lyrics-vn93g59.html\">The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn - The Pogues</a></h2><p>This one\u2019s about Tyrion\u2026 the song is very Celtic with lots of history about the people. Basically, it\u2019s about the urge to self-destruct and about a man\u2019s life-long descent into alcoholism. SO, yeah, Tyrion.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/neil-young-winterlong-lyrics-hgfg4d1.html\">Winterlong - Neil Young</a></h2><p>Well, this certainly seems to apply to Gendry after Arya turned down his proposal. Very promising though is the fact that nothing in the song is definite. It was all \u201cif\u2026\u201d \u201cyou seem to be\u2026\u201d</p><blockquote><p>I waited for you, Winterlong<br>You seem to be where I belong.<br>It\u2019s all illusion anyway.</p></blockquote><p>\u201cYou seem\u2026\u201d that leaves it to open, the possibility of her coming back is not closed off. The \u201cillusion\u201d could refer to the title and castle.</p><blockquote><p>If things should ever turn out wrong<br>And all the love we have is gone,<br>It won\u2019t be easy on that day.</p></blockquote><p>\u201cIf\u201d and \u201cit won\u2019t be easy <b>on that day</b>\u201d makes it clear he hasn\u2019t given up, he\u2019s still waiting for his girl to come to him.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/blitzen-trapper-furr-lyrics-n5562tm.html\">Furr - Blitzen Trapper</a></h2><p>OK, guys, this is it. I know I keep saying it, but yeah, Arya and Gendry? Are absolutely endgame. This song sounds absolutely like Arya deciding to give up her Stark-ways, being the killer with a list, etc. and joining Gendry. I mean, for reals! I\u2019m just putting all the lyrics here bolding key phrases.</p><blockquote><p>Yeah, when I was only 17,<br><b>I could hear the angels whispering</b><br>So I droned into the words and<br>Wondered aimlessly about till<br>I<b> heard my mother shouting through the fog<br>It turned out to be the howling of a dog<br>Or a wolf to be exact.<br>The sound sent shivers down my back<br>But I was drawn into the pack.</b><br>And before long, they allowed me<br>To join in and sing their song.<br>So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah<br>We would gladly get our fill,<br>Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn.<br><b>And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong.<br>For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah<br>And my thoughts, they surely were turned to<br>Instinct and obedience to God.</b></p><p>[Chorus]<br>You can wear your fur<br>Like the river on fire.<br>But you better be sure<br>If you\u2019re makin\u2019 God a liar.<br>I\u2019m a rattlesnake, babe,<br>I\u2019m like fuel on fire.<br>So if you\u2019re gonna\u2019 get made,<br>Don\u2019t be afraid of what you\u2019ve learned.</p><p>On the day that I turned 23,<br><b>I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree.<br>When suddenly a girl</b><br>With skin the color of a pearl,<br><b>Wandered aimlessly,<br>But she didn\u2019t seem to see.<br>She was listenin\u2019 for the angels just like me.</b><br><b>So I stood and looked about.<br>I brushed the leaves off of my snout.<br>And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees.<br>You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees.<br>So I took her by the arm<br>We settled down upon a farm.<br>And raised our children up as<br>Gently as you pleased.</b></p><p><b>And now my fur has turned to skin.<br>And I\u2019ve been quickly ushered in<br>To a world that I confess I do not know.<br>But I still dream of running careless through the snow.</b><br>An\u2019 through the howlin\u2019 winds that blow,<br>Across the ancient distant flow,<br>It fill our bodies up like water till we know.</p><p>[Chorus]</p></blockquote><p>OK, now aside from the very, very obviousness of the fact that if you switch the genders\u2013which, when a song THIS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATES Arya and Gendry\u2019s story with references to wolves and packs and settling in a farm (forest lass), etc. one can not worry about the gender not matching perfectly\u2013there\u2019s another very key thing one has to bear in mind.\u00a0</p><p>The song is called \u201cFurr.\u201d That title clearly references the narrator (who in this case would be Arya) being a wolf. The group name is Blitzen Trapper. Blitzen is, of course, famously known as one of the reindeer who pulled Santa\u2019s sleigh. While science has now proven that all of Santa\u2019s reindeer were likely female as male reindeer shed their antlers in December, it is highly unlikely that when the tale was first told that such was known therefore we\u2019re going with the original conception that Blitzen is indeed male. And since Blitzen is known as a male reindeer, well, another name for a male deer is a\u2026 stag. So, not only does the song itself alone scream an Arya and Gendrya endgame (it really, really, REALLY does). </p><p>The group name + the song title + the meaning of the song = <b>The Stag caught the Wolf with his love. \u00a0</b></p><p>At this point, let me remind ya\u2019ll that Benioff and Weiss said about this playlist, \u201cThe answer to the ending is one hundred percent hidden in the playlist choices. No one will believe us, but it\u2019s true.\u201d Uh huh. I believe you!</p><h2>Power - AJ Ghent\u00a0</h2><p>There are no lyrics for this one, so I just listened to it and really, I think it might be the beginning of the season when Dany was feeling confident about taking on the Army of the Dead and Cersei. OR it could be Cersei feeling confident about taking on Dany with her greater numbers. It\u2019s easier to analyze it when you can look at the lyrics. :shrugs:</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/system-of-a-down-toxicity-lyrics-hd7dncz.html\">Toxicity - System of a Down</a></h2><p>This song is really about nature being corrupted and capitalism taking over the world, so all I can really take from it is in relation to the endgame that it\u2019s Sansa and her opinion of Dany and how she thinks that she is a conqueror set on taking over Westeros by any means necessary.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/papa-roach-born-for-greatness-lyrics-66ngfhd.html\">Born For Greatness - Papa Roach</a></h2><p>Oh, my heart. I think this is about Varys, whom I\u2019ve always loved. He\u2019s my fave character in the whole series.</p><blockquote><p>I am a man at war<br>And I am fighting for<br>All of the broken people<br>All of the people thrown overboard<br>They always tried to shame us<br>But they don\u2019t speak our language<br>No, we\u2019re not nameless, we\u2019re not faceless<br>We were born for greatness</p></blockquote><p>Yup, and he fought all the way to the end.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/yeah-yeah-yeahs-gold-lion-lyrics-7s4kw7d.html\">Gold Lion - Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>\u00a0</h2><p>I could be totally wrong, but all I can think here is Cersei\u2019s downfall and her and Jaime\u2019s death although he tried to rescue her.</p><blockquote><p>Gold lion\u2019s gonna tell me where the light is,<br>Gold lion\u2019s gonna tell me where the light is,<br>Take our hands out of control,<br>Take our hands out of control</p><p>Now, tell me what you saw,<br>Tell me what you saw,<br>There was a crowd of seeds,<br>Inside, outside,<br>I must have done a dozen each</p><p>It was the height I threw, the weight,<br>The shell was crushing you,<br>I\u2019ve been around a few</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-thermals-here-s-your-future-lyrics-8x2jq48.html\">Here\u2019s Your Future - The Thermals</a></h2><p>There\u2019s gonna be a lot of death and destruction and people are going to pay for their sins, and someone is going to be sacrificed for sins that they did not commit, maybe not in death, but that person won\u2019t be happy. And I think that person will be Jon.</p><blockquote><p>God reached his hand down from the sky<br>He flooded the land and he set it afire<br>He said fear me again and know I\u2019m your father<br>And remember that no one can breathe underwater</p></blockquote><p>The deaths Dany caused, Theon\u2019s death, all the Ironborn deaths, including Euron\u2019s mens\u2019 deaths.</p><blockquote><p>God told his son it\u2019s time to come home<br>I promise you won\u2019t have to die all alone<br>I need you to pay for the sins I create<br>Son said I will but dad I\u2019m afraid</p></blockquote><p>Jon\u2019s no Jesus, but he\u2019s the closest thing to a sacrificial lamb this show has. He\u2019s already died once and risen for the sins of others.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/u2-love-is-blindness-lyrics-h7k29dm.html\">Love is Blindness - U2</a></h2><p>Dany and Jon. Period.</p><blockquote><p>Love is blindness<br>I don\u2019t want to see<br>Won\u2019t you wrap the night<br>Around me<br>Oh my heart<br>Love is blindness</p></blockquote><p>They don\u2019t want to know what they know about Jon\u2019s parentage. It\u2019s as simple as that. It changed everything for them.</p><hr><p>And that\u2019s all she wrote. Agree, disagree\u2026 thoughts? I\u2019d really like to know what other people think.</p>",

Weiss and Daniel Benioff helped create a new Spotify playlist: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXdnZT5DhATDx?si=Fm6C_nfHShCGLFHVluC5qQ\"><i>Game of Thrones</i>: The End Is Coming</a>. Upon doing so, they told For the Record in an email, \u201cThe answer to the ending is one hundred percent hidden in the playlist choices. No one will believe us, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>I have spent the last couple of weeks going through each song and trying to figure out which character, which scenario, arc, storyline each song was about. I could be completely way-off, but it was fun. So here you. Enjoy! (Note: All songs link to full lyrics.)</p><p>Fair warning, this is long. Very long. So long that I\u2019m going to put a cut.

And yet, she\u2019s so surrounded, covered, engulfed in death that she\u2019s unclean.</p><blockquote><p>See she comes<br>Blacker than pitch<br>Have to make this fallen bitch<br>All I want<br>All I crave<br>Demoness calls<br>The bitch is come<br>For those who wait<br>Cross the breach in hell<br>See she is<br>Bedeviled with breasts<br>Enchantment on legs</p></blockquote><p>This stanza here even fits her if you take into account the fact that the Hound calls her a bitch all the time, and the last two lines, well, we do see Arya as a woman for the first time this season. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/led-zeppelin-immigrant-song-lyrics-lvxdt1w.html\">Immigrant Song (Remaster) - Led Zeppelin</a></h2><p>\n\nThe Army of the Undead want to take over Westeros.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-doors-end-lyrics-pr4s3dw.html\">The End (Remaster) - The Doors</a></h2><p>The could certainly be about Jaime and Cersei, but something about it just says the Hound and Arya to me because of a line in the final stanza: \u201cYou\u2019ll never follow me\u201d and that obviously does not apply to the twins. Plus, there is a reference to a \u201cStranger\u201d in the song. The Hound\u2019s horse was \u201cStranger\u201d and, of course, as has been established this season, the Hound=death and in the faith of the Seven, the Stranger represents death.</p><blockquote><p>This is the end<br>Beautiful friend<br>This is the end<br>My only friend</p><p>The end<br>Of our elaborate plans<br>The end<br>Of everything that stands<br>The end<br>No safety or surprise<br>The end<br>I\u2019ll never look into your eyes<br>Again</p><p>Can you picture what will be<br>So limitless and free<br>Desperately in need of some stranger\u2019s hand<br>In a desperate land</p></blockquote><p>Arya is the Hound\u2019s only friend, and in many ways, he\u2019s Arya\u2019s only friend now that Gendry has become something more. It\u2019s the end of their journey together. </p><p>There is this stanza which is why one could think it references Jaime and Cersei with the references to father, brother and sister:</p><blockquote><p>The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on<br>He took a face from the ancient gallery<br>And he walked on down the hall<br>He went into the room where his sister lived, and\u2026then he<br>Paid a visit to his brother, and then he<br>He walked on down the hall, and<br>And he came to a door\u2026and he looked inside<br>\u201cFather?\u201d \u201cYes, son.\u201d \u201cI want to kill you.\u201d<br>\u201cMother, I want to\u2026\u201d</p></blockquote><p>But I took that as more allegorical, the Hound being the killer who is ready to finally kill his family, i.e., his brother. </p><p>And then we come to the end of the song and it is full of profanity after profanity, the Hound\u2019s calling card before leading to death and then those lines that just scream the Hound to Arya.</p><blockquote><p>Fuck, fuck-ah, yeah<br>Fuck<br>Fuck<br>Fuck, fuck<br>Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah<br>C'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah<br>Fuck me, baby, fuck yeah<br>Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah!<br>Fuck, yeah! C'mon, baby<br>Fuck me, baby, fuck, fuck, yeah<br>Whoa, whoa, yeah, fuck, baby<br>C'mon, yeah, huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah<br>All right</p><p>Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill</p><p>This is the end<br>Beautiful friend<br>This is the end<br>My only friend, the end</p><p><b>It hurts to set you free<br>But you\u2019ll never follow me</b><br>The end of laughter and soft lies<br><b>The end of nights we tried to die</b></p><p>This is the end</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/bob-dylan-feat.-johnny-cash-girl-from-the-north-country-lyrics-wlck3j6.html\">Girl From the North Country - Bob Dylan</a></h2><p>Yes, I know there is a line in this song that references the girl\u2019s long hair lying past her breast, but regardless, everything else about this song just screams pre-season Gendry and Arya. \u00a0It totally, totally does. It just totally is Gendry pining for Arya. Nothing else makes sense. N-O-T-H-I-N-G!\u00a0</p><p>I know that some have tried to fit it with Sansa and Tyrion, and I love them, but it just doesn\u2019t fit them. Sansa is in no way Tyrion\u2019s true love, she just isn\u2019t. He hasn\u2019t been thinking of her throughout his time away from her. We know that. We absolutely know that. It does not fit them, sorry Sanrion fans (I\u2019m one of them).</p><p>Now, if there is some time jump that we see in episode 06 before Arya goes to Gendry (because, yes, I\u2019m still convinced that we are getting an Arya/Gendry endgame), then maybe this will apply to *that* timeframe, but as of now, I still see it as pre-season 08 Gendrya, just the feeling, the tenor and tone of it. Think of Gendry\u2019s line to her in the second episode:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>The last time you saw me, you asked me to come to Winterfell. I took the long road\u2026 </p></blockquote><p>Yeah. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/guns-n-roses-mama-kin-lyrics-fq4j59q.html\">Mama Kin (Live Version) - Guns n Roses</a></h2><p>(FYI: These are the lyrics for the live version, so they may differ slightly.)</p><p>I believe this one is about Cersei and how her life has been spent living a lie, putting on a show, but it\u2019s all just that, a show.</p><blockquote><p>losin\u2019 touch with all that\u2019s real<br>Whole lotta lover, keepin\u2019 undercover</p></blockquote><p>Cersei so often just can\u2019t face the reality of all the shit going on around her, through most of her relationship with Jaime, she kept that a secret and even kept her other lovers a secret from him. </p><blockquote><p>You\u2019ve been fadin\u2019, always out paradin\u2019</p></blockquote><p>Cersei has always been hiding who she really is, pretending to be the perfect queen, the perfect wife, perfect mother.</p><blockquote><p>Spittin\u2019 fire from your mouth just like a dragon</p></blockquote><p>She does incest like the Targaryens. She\u2019s crazy like the Targaryens, but she\u2019s not a Targaryen. </p><blockquote><p>You better check it out \u2018cause someday soon<br>You\u2019ll have to climb back on the wagon</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not going to last, she\u2019s not going to get her happy ending. (Duh.)</p><blockquote><p>It ain\u2019t easy livin\u2019 like you want to</p></blockquote><p>She became the queen, the ruler of the seven kingdoms, but NOTHING has come easy and it\u2019s still hard for and she never had peace or happiness.</p><blockquote><p>And workin\u2019 for daddy\u2019s such a drag<br>You still stuff your mouth With his beans</p></blockquote><p>She as always under Twyin\u2019s control, she hated it, but she was always under his thumb, always playing by his rules.</p><p>This was all about Cersei not being good enough, wanting more, but never getting it, giving up everything and never getting it. She should have cherished what mattered, but she didn\u2019t and lost everything consequently.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitestripes/sevennationarmy.html\">Seven Nation Army - The White Stripes\u00a0</a></h2><p>Dany as Mad Queen. Now, this could have been about Cersei, but there\u2019s a line that screams treason, so\u2026 Dany.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI\u2019m gonna fight \u2018em off<br>A seven nation army couldn\u2019t hold me back<br>They\u2019re gonna rip it off<br><b>Taking their time right behind my back</b><br>And I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to myself at night<br>Because I can\u2019t forget<br>Back and forth through my mind\n\n<br></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blackkeys/howlinforyou.html\">Howlin For You - The Black Keys</a></h2><p>\n\nThis is so obviously Gendry about Arya that they might as well have revealed it as such after episode 02 in the \u201cInside the Episode\u201d video.\n\n<br></p><blockquote><p>I must admit<br>I can\u2019t explain<br>Any of these thoughts racing<br>Through my brain</p><p>It\u2019s true<br>Baby I\u2019m howlin\u2019 for you</p><p>Can\u2019t you see<br>Little girl\u2019s<br>Got a hold on me</p><p>Like glue<br>Baby I\u2019m howlin\u2019 for you</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/grandson/war.html\">War - Grandson</a>\u00a0</h2><p>Pretty clearly about the war against the Undead.</p><h2><a href=\"https://genius.com/Des-rocs-let-me-live-let-me-die-lyrics\">Let Me Live/Let Me Die - Des Rocs</a></h2><p>Arya again, specifically with Beric sacrificing himself to save her and then her going to kill the Night King.</p><blockquote><p>I know pain, I know dread<br>Wicked veins, they turn to lead<br>Tears don\u2019t stop the fire<br>It\u2019s killing time</p><p>Back from the dead<br>See, their eyes got nothing left<br>Kiss me, I am the cobra<br>It\u2019s killing time</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://lyricstranslate.com/en/flugufrelsarinn-flys-savior.html-0\">Flugufrelsarinn - Sigur Ros</a></h2><p>This was in another language, I read the translation and I\u2019m so not sure, but I\u2019m thinking maybe Grey Worm and Missandei\u2026</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tommorello/cantstopthebleeding.html\">Can\u2019t Stop The Bleeding - Tom Morello feat. Gary Clark Jr. and Gramatik</a></h2><p>I think this is Tyrion realizing that Dany is not the one. Interestingly enough, prior to last week, this song was NOT on the playlist. There were only 50 songs and then, boom!, this one was added.</p><blockquote><p>Can\u2019t stop the bleeding, calling<br>Can\u2019t stop the bleeding, oh</p><p>Fill my soul, it\u2019s hard to see<br>Trouble found and trouble lost<br>20 miles dark and deep<br>Trouble paid and trouble bought, uh</p><p>Frayed like myth, every fool caught it<br>Sound like this, every fool bought it</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion was duped into believing that Daenerys was the Princess that was Promised, and I think he\u2019s going to something drastic about it.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/barns-courtney-fire-lyrics-lzk3qcl.html\">Fire - Barns Courtney</a></h2><p>Ceganebowl!</p><blockquote><p>Oh, a thousand faces staring at me<br>Thousand times I\u2019ve fallen<br>Thousand voices dead at my feet<br>Now I\u2019m gone, now I\u2019m gone, now I\u2019m gone</p><p>And my mother told me, \u201cSon, let it be.\u201d<br>Sold my soul to the calling<br>Sold my soul to a sweet melody<br>Now I\u2019m gone, now I\u2019m gone, now I\u2019m gone</p><p>Oh, gimme that fire<br>Oh, gimme that fire<br>Oh, gimme that fire<br>Burn, burn, burn</p></blockquote><p>The mother in the song is metaphorical or one could take it as the Mother of the New Gods and the Mother stands, among other things, for mercy and peace. And we all know that the Hound is not going to 'Let it be\" so it\u2019s pretty clear that this is the Hound facing his deepest fear\u2013diving headfirst into fire\u2013at the same time finally getting his soul\u2019s desire and taking out his brother.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/missio-bottom-of-the-deep-blue-sea-lyrics-fr61lsv.html\">Bottom of the Deep Blue Sea - MISSIO</a></h2><p>The pretty gross relationship between Euron and Cersei, and after episode 05, more specifically, the demise of Euron Greyjoy! (The crowd cheers!)</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pixies/waveofmutilation.html\">Wave of Mutilation - Pixies</a>\u00a0</h2><p>This one\u2019s about Theon.</p><blockquote><p>cease to resist, giving my goodbye<br>drive my car into the ocean<br>you\u2019ll think i\u2019m dead, but i sail away<br>on a wave of mutilation<br>a wave<br>wave</p><p>i\u2019ve kissed mermaids, rode the el nino<br>walked the sand with the crustaceans<br>could find my way to mariana<br>on a wave of mutilation,<br>wave of mutilation<br>wave of mutilation<br>wave</p></blockquote><p>Saying goodbye to Yara, the ocean references, \u201cWhat is dead may never die\u201d = \u201cyou\u2019ll think i\u2019m dead, but i sail away,\u201d the mutilation\" theme. \u00a0Yeah, good ole Theon.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/tv-on-the-radio-wolf-like-me-lyrics-w66mmbn.html\">Wolf Like Me - TV On the Radio</a></h2><p>I think this is about Sansa to Tyrion, using him to get to Dany.</p><blockquote><p>Say<br>Say my playmate<br>Won\u2019t you lay your hands on me<br>Mirror my malady<br>Transfer my tragedy</p></blockquote><p>\u201cPlaymate\u201d as in someone who is playing the 'game\u2019 with her, and the final two lines, the two of them sharing their fears, their miseries, knowing what the other has been through.</p><blockquote><p>We could jet in a stolen car<br>But I bet we wouldn\u2019t get too far<br>Before the transformation takes<br>And bloodlust tanks and<br>Crave gets slaked</p></blockquote><p>They could work together, maybe even try marriage again, but both of them know it wouldn\u2019t last because there are too many ambitions and lusts and powerplays going on, not necessarily just within them but around them.</p><blockquote><p>My mind has changed<br>My body\u2019s frame but god I like it<br>My hearts aflame<br>My body\u2019s strained but god I like it</p></blockquote><p>Sansa has become stronger and smarter, she\u2019s changed and it\u2019s been hard and it\u2019s still hard, but she likes it.</p><blockquote><p>Gonna teach you tricks that\u2019ll blow your<br>Mongrel mind<br>Baby doll I recognize<br>You\u2019re a hideous thing inside<br>If ever there were a lucky kind it\u2019s<br>You you you you</p></blockquote><p>She recognizes his flaws, where she can manipulate him now because she learned from Cersei and Littlefinger, and she knows that it wasn\u2019t just his brains that got him this far, but he\u2019s had luck help him too. Of course, Tyrion is not a \u201chideous thing inside\u201d and I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s how Sansa sees him, but this whole section is how she manipulated him, how she used him, because she did. It\u2019s about her being able to manipulate him as Cersei and Littlefinger taught her. The only truly hideous characters inside left this season were Euron and Cersei and none of the Starks would have interacted with them to fit this song; that was just one part of the song that was definitely metaphorical.</p><blockquote><p>Writhing under your riding hood</p></blockquote><p>I just think that the reference to \u201criding hood\u201d was a key to this being about Sansa with the immediate jump to \u201cred\u201d from that phrase and Sansa\u2019s red hair.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kanyewest/power.html\">POWER - Kanye West</a></h2><p>The best I can make of this is that it\u2019s about Sansa getting through all that she has been through to be in control where she is and she\u2019s now determined that one person is not going to be in power of all of them, especially not the North. </p><blockquote><p>Rumble young man, rumble<br>Life is a trip so sometimes we gon\u2019 stumble<br>You gotta go through pain in order to become you<br>But once the world numbs you, you\u2019ll feel like it\u2019s only one you<br>Man, you got the power to do anything you want to<br>Until you ask yourself, \u201cIs that what it\u2019s all come to?\u201d<br>Looking at life through sunglasses in the sunroof<br>Do you have the power to get out from up under you<br>Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you</p></blockquote><p>I could be totally and absolutely wrong with this one.\u00a0</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/fear-let-s-have-a-war-lyrics-mvjxsgz.html\">Let\u2019s Have a War - Fear</a></h2><p>Cersei\u2019s perspective re: the battle of King\u2019s Landing.</p><blockquote><p>There\u2019s so many of us<br>There\u2019s so many of us<br>There\u2019s so many<br>There\u2019s so many of us<br>There\u2019s so many of us<br>There\u2019s so many</p><p>Let\u2019s have a war<br>So you can go and die<br>Let\u2019s have a war<br>We could all use the money</p><p>Let\u2019s have a war<br>We need the space<br>Let\u2019s have a war<br>Clean out this place</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/tune-yards-powa-lyrics-rzhqcx7.html\">Powa - Tune-Yards</a>\u00a0</h2><p>Dany breaking her promise to Tyrion about burning King\u2019s Landing if the bells rang.</p><blockquote><p>Rebel, rebel, no<br>Lightening dances in my head<br>Devil, devil, whoa, oh, oh<br>Burning steady as a motor</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>'Cause you bomb me with lies,<br>humiliations everyday<br>You bomb me so many times</p><p>I never find my way<br>Come on and bomb me<br>Why won\u2019t you bomb me?<br>Come on and bomb<br>Go on and whoa</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/van-morrison-listen-to-the-lion-lyrics-nsv5jl5.html\">Listen to the Lion - Van Morrison</a></h2><p>The first half of this just screams the end of Jaime and Cersei:</p><blockquote><p>And all my love come down<br>All my love come tumblin\u2019 down<br>All my love come tumblin\u2019 down<br>All my love come tumblin\u2019 down<br>Oh, listen listen<br>To the lion<br>Oh, listen listen listen<br>To the lion\u2026<br>Inside of me<br>Oh, oh, oh</p><p>And I shall search my soul<br>I shall search my very soul<br>And I shall search my very soul<br>I shall search my very so-o-oul</p><p>For the lion<br>For the lion<br>For the lion<br>For the lion\u2026<br>Inside of me<br>Oh, oh, yeah</p><p>And all my tears have flown<br>All my tears like water flown</p></blockquote><p>Right? That\u2019s their end. Things literally came tumbling down on them, the lion inside Cersei, the Lannister sigil is the Lion, she\u2019s pregnant with their last child. All tears have flown because they gonna die, can\u2019t cry no more, right? So, obviously this song is about the end of Jaime and Cersei, except\u2026 for the next part of the song.</p><blockquote><p>And we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>And we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>And we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>\u2026 sailed to Caledonia</p><p>And we sailed, and we sailed,<br>And we sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>Away from Denmark<br>Way up to Caledonia<br>Away from Denmark<br>Way up to Caledonia</p><p>And we sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed\u2026<br>All around the World<br>And we sailed\u2026, and we sailed\u2026, and we sailed\u2026<br>Looking for a brand new start</p></blockquote><p>(They sailed to a few more places, but you get the point.) So, clearly Jaime and Cersei aren\u2019t doing that\u2026 unless, they did somehow escape those tumbling rocks and we\u2019ll see them in the final episode, then, yeah, this song *is* about them. If not and they do be dead and gone, then, well, yeah, I could see this song being about Ser Brienne of Tarth. Because the first part of the song would totally fit her too\u2026 if she, like Cersei, had a Jaime Lannister Lion inside her. Uh huh.</p><p>We shall see. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/cage-the-elephant-cold-cold-cold-lyrics-h8tfkj4.html\">Cold Cold Cold - Cage the Elephants</a></h2><p>I\u2019m thinking this one\u2019s about Jon and his conflict over his identity, because\u00a0first off we start early on with this line:</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019ve been breathing air but there\u2019s no sign of life</p></blockquote><p>Jon, technically, isn\u2019t alive, being a fire wight and all, so, I\u2019m just saying.</p><blockquote><p>Tell me how hard will I fall if I live a double life</p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow / Aegon Targaryen. Uh huh.</p><blockquote><p>And as the darkness falls it fills up both my eyes<br>My life before me like a flash in the night<br>With my arms open wide</p><p>Well it\u2019s cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br>Cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br>Cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br>Doctor can you help me cause something don\u2019t feel right<br>Something don\u2019t feel right, something just ain\u2019t right</p></blockquote><p>He found out all of this right before the Long Night.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/queens-of-the-stone-age-no-one-knows-lyrics-qtbj71l.html\">No One Knows - Queens of the Stone Age</a></h2><p>This is absolutely about Arya and the whole the Hound=Death and Gendry=Life theory.</p><blockquote><p>And I realize you\u2019re mine<br>Indeed a fool am I<br>And I realize you\u2019re mine<br>Indeed a fool am I<br>Ahh</p></blockquote><p>Gendry proposed, offered himself to her, asked her to be with him\u2026 and she totes is gonna realize that she was a fool because he is hers.</p><blockquote><p>Heaven smiles above me<br>What a gift here below<br>But no one knows<br>A gift that you give to me<br>No one knows</p></blockquote><p>The Hound gave Arya a gift, he made her realize that it\u2019s time to LIVE her life, instead of dying everyday just waiting for death. Once upon a time, Arya was No One. Yuppers.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/biffyclyro/wolvesofwinter.html\">Wolves of Winter - Biffy Clyro</a></h2><p>This has got to be Sansa giving some straight talk to Dany.</p><blockquote><p>Justify your reasons, now it is my turn<br>We are the wolves!<br>How\u2019s it gonna feel when there\u2019s no one to support ya?<br>How\u2019s it gonna feel when you\u2019re standing there alone?</p><p>We have achieved so much more than you possibly thought we could<br>(I love that you\u2019re seething)<br>You can achieve anything, just remember no I in team<br>(But there\u2019s two in brilliant)<br>We are the wolves of winter<br>We live in a kingdom of blood</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nothingmore/gotowar.html\">Go to War - Nothing More</a></h2><p>Dany to Jon episode 04 is what this is feels like this is referencing.</p><blockquote><p>Screaming at the ones we love<br>Like we forgot who we can trust<br>Screaming at the top of our lungs<br>On the grounds where we feel safe<br>Do we feel safe?<br>Do we feel safe?</p></blockquote><p>She\u2019s lost so many people and feels like those she has she can\u2019t completely trust. She doesn\u2019t feel safe.</p><blockquote><p>Hush, my baby, make no sound<br>Maybe we can wait each other out<br>It\u2019s a cold war<br>Let\u2019s go to war</p><p>With every settled score<br>I thought that fighting with meant fighting for<br>But you turn it around<br>But you turn it around<br>(War, war, war!)</p></blockquote><p>She doesn\u2019t feel she has anyone completely on her side anymore.</p><blockquote><p>Every feeling in my bones<br>Tells me to lash out and tell you to fuck off<br>You\u2019ve got my heart and I\u2019ve got your soul<br>But are we better off alone?<br>With every battle we lose a little more<br>Remember everything that we\u2019d die for<br>You are everything that I\u2019d die for</p></blockquote><p>Dany still loves and wants Jon, but Jon no longer can love her like *that.* And Dany keeps losing more and more with every battle, and she hasn\u2019t forgotten what she\u2019s fighting and what everyone that she loves has died for.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/royalblood/littlemonster.html\">Little Monster - Royal Blood</a></h2><p>I think this one is about Jon taking on Tyrion.</p><blockquote><p>Hey little monster, I got my eye on you<br>Where are you going, where you running to?<br>Hey little monster, you know it\u2019s all ok<br>I\u2019m gonna love you, no matter what you say</p></blockquote><p>I think this may be about Jon and Tyrion trying to come to terms with what Dany is doing before they part ways on how to deal with her IF my speculation is correct that Tyrion winds up killing her to protect the realm. And then from that point on, things change between Jon and Tyrion. The next part of the song is more about Jon\u2019s feelings for Dany and how Tyrion is going to see the Wolf in Jon Snow.</p><blockquote><p>I got love on my fingers<br>Lust on my tongue<br>You say you got nothing,<br>So come out and get some<br>Heartache to Heartache,<br>I\u2019m your wolf- I\u2019m your man<br>I say run little monster,<br>Before you know who I am</p></blockquote><p>Jon had Daenerys\u2019 love and Tyrion didn\u2019t. Tyrion took Dany out to protect the realm and Jon understands that it came from a place from honor and that Tyrion loved Dany, but it doesn\u2019t matter, Jon is going to show avenge her.</p><p>I could be totes wrong, though.

And since I firmly believe that the Hound=Death, and Gendry=life, and both are crazy entangled up with Arya this season, that therefore means the new life she starts will be with Gendry.</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019ve been dreaming 'bout, hope for better days<br>Time for dreaming\u2019s done, time to face the sun</p><p>(Flying high above the world)<br>It\u2019s a new life, it\u2019s a new mind<br>And I will never fall</p></blockquote><p>Arya rode away on that white horse, flying high and you know she will not fall.

The bottom line is that this song is about seeing beyond the divisions. Therefore, this song\u2026 is Jon\u2019s point of view. We all are in this together: The Living against the Undead.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/born_ruffians/this_sentence_will_ruinsave_your_life-lyrics-1135073.html\">This Sentence Will Ruin/Save Your Life - Young Ruffians</a></h2><p>This whole song is about someone trying to figure things out. It\u2019s about someone who frankly knows nothing\u2026 so, uhm, yeah, Jon Snow, and his identity crisis and trying to figure out what the fuck to do.</p><blockquote><p>I need to know who I am<br>and what I\u2019m going to do while I\u2019m on earth<br>I need to understand<br>everything and everybody\u2019s lives</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-pogues-the-sick-bed-of-cuchulainn-lyrics-vn93g59.html\">The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn - The Pogues</a></h2><p>This one\u2019s about Tyrion\u2026 the song is very Celtic with lots of history about the people. Basically, it\u2019s about the urge to self-destruct and about a man\u2019s life-long descent into alcoholism. SO, yeah, Tyrion.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/neil-young-winterlong-lyrics-hgfg4d1.html\">Winterlong - Neil Young</a></h2><p>Well, this certainly seems to apply to Gendry after Arya turned down his proposal. Very promising though is the fact that nothing in the song is definite.

The \u201cillusion\u201d could refer to the title and castle.</p><blockquote><p>If things should ever turn out wrong<br>And all the love we have is gone,<br>It won\u2019t be easy on that day.</p></blockquote><p>\u201cIf\u201d and \u201cit won\u2019t be easy <b>on that day</b>\u201d makes it clear he hasn\u2019t given up, he\u2019s still waiting for his girl to come to him.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/blitzen-trapper-furr-lyrics-n5562tm.html\">Furr - Blitzen Trapper</a></h2><p>OK, guys, this is it. I know I keep saying it, but yeah, Arya and Gendry? Are absolutely endgame. This song sounds absolutely like Arya deciding to give up her Stark-ways, being the killer with a list, etc. and joining Gendry. I mean, for reals! I\u2019m just putting all the lyrics here bolding key phrases.</p><blockquote><p>Yeah, when I was only 17,<br><b>I could hear the angels whispering</b><br>So I droned into the words and<br>Wondered aimlessly about till<br>I<b> heard my mother shouting through the fog<br>It turned out to be the howling of a dog<br>Or a wolf to be exact.<br>The sound sent shivers down my back<br>But I was drawn into the pack.</b><br>And before long, they allowed me<br>To join in and sing their song.<br>So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah<br>We would gladly get our fill,<br>Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn.<br><b>And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong.<br>For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah<br>And my thoughts, they surely were turned to<br>Instinct and obedience to God.</b></p><p>[Chorus]<br>You can wear your fur<br>Like the river on fire.<br>But you better be sure<br>If you\u2019re makin\u2019 God a liar.<br>I\u2019m a rattlesnake, babe,<br>I\u2019m like fuel on fire.<br>So if you\u2019re gonna\u2019 get made,<br>Don\u2019t be afraid of what you\u2019ve learned.</p><p>On the day that I turned 23,<br><b>I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree.<br>When suddenly a girl</b><br>With skin the color of a pearl,<br><b>Wandered aimlessly,<br>But she didn\u2019t seem to see.<br>She was listenin\u2019 for the angels just like me.</b><br><b>So I stood and looked about.<br>I brushed the leaves off of my snout.<br>And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees.<br>You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees.<br>So I took her by the arm<br>We settled down upon a farm.<br>And raised our children up as<br>Gently as you pleased.</b></p><p><b>And now my fur has turned to skin.<br>And I\u2019ve been quickly ushered in<br>To a world that I confess I do not know.<br>But I still dream of running careless through the snow.</b><br>An\u2019 through the howlin\u2019 winds that blow,<br>Across the ancient distant flow,<br>It fill our bodies up like water till we know.</p><p>[Chorus]</p></blockquote><p>OK, now aside from the very, very obviousness of the fact that if you switch the genders\u2013which, when a song THIS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATES Arya and Gendry\u2019s story with references to wolves and packs and settling in a farm (forest lass), etc. one can not worry about the gender not matching perfectly\u2013there\u2019s another very key thing one has to bear in mind.\u00a0</p><p>The song is called \u201cFurr.\u201d That title clearly references the narrator (who in this case would be Arya) being a wolf. The group name is Blitzen Trapper. Blitzen is, of course, famously known as one of the reindeer who pulled Santa\u2019s sleigh. While science has now proven that all of Santa\u2019s reindeer were likely female as male reindeer shed their antlers in December, it is highly unlikely that when the tale was first told that such was known therefore we\u2019re going with the original conception that Blitzen is indeed male. And since Blitzen is known as a male reindeer, well, another name for a male deer is a\u2026 stag. So, not only does the song itself alone scream an Arya and Gendrya endgame (it really, really, REALLY does). </p><p>The group name + the song title + the meaning of the song = <b>The Stag caught the Wolf with his love. \u00a0</b></p><p>At this point, let me remind ya\u2019ll that Benioff and Weiss said about this playlist, \u201cThe answer to the ending is one hundred percent hidden in the playlist choices. No one will believe us, but it\u2019s true.\u201d Uh huh. I believe you!</p><h2>Power - AJ Ghent\u00a0</h2><p>There are no lyrics for this one, so I just listened to it and really, I think it might be the beginning of the season when Dany was feeling confident about taking on the Army of the Dead and Cersei. OR it could be Cersei feeling confident about taking on Dany with her greater numbers. It\u2019s easier to analyze it when you can look at the lyrics. :shrugs:</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/system-of-a-down-toxicity-lyrics-hd7dncz.html\">Toxicity - System of a Down</a></h2><p>This song is really about nature being corrupted and capitalism taking over the world, so all I can really take from it is in relation to the endgame that it\u2019s Sansa and her opinion of Dany and how she thinks that she is a conqueror set on taking over Westeros by any means necessary.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/papa-roach-born-for-greatness-lyrics-66ngfhd.html\">Born For Greatness - Papa Roach</a></h2><p>Oh, my heart. I think this is about Varys, whom I\u2019ve always loved. He\u2019s my fave character in the whole series.</p><blockquote><p>I am a man at war<br>And I am fighting for<br>All of the broken people<br>All of the people thrown overboard<br>They always tried to shame us<br>But they don\u2019t speak our language<br>No, we\u2019re not nameless, we\u2019re not faceless<br>We were born for greatness</p></blockquote><p>Yup, and he fought all the way to the end.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/yeah-yeah-yeahs-gold-lion-lyrics-7s4kw7d.html\">Gold Lion - Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>\u00a0</h2><p>I could be totally wrong, but all I can think here is Cersei\u2019s downfall and her and Jaime\u2019s death although he tried to rescue her.</p><blockquote><p>Gold lion\u2019s gonna tell me where the light is,<br>Gold lion\u2019s gonna tell me where the light is,<br>Take our hands out of control,<br>Take our hands out of control</p><p>Now, tell me what you saw,<br>Tell me what you saw,<br>There was a crowd of seeds,<br>Inside, outside,<br>I must have done a dozen each</p><p>It was the height I threw, the weight,<br>The shell was crushing you,<br>I\u2019ve been around a few</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-thermals-here-s-your-future-lyrics-8x2jq48.html\">Here\u2019s Your Future - The Thermals</a></h2><p>There\u2019s gonna be a lot of death and destruction and people are going to pay for their sins, and someone is going to be sacrificed for sins that they did not commit, maybe not in death, but that person won\u2019t be happy. And I think that person will be Jon.</p><blockquote><p>God reached his hand down from the sky<br>He flooded the land and he set it afire<br>He said fear me again and know I\u2019m your father<br>And remember that no one can breathe underwater</p></blockquote><p>The deaths Dany caused, Theon\u2019s death, all the Ironborn deaths, including Euron\u2019s mens\u2019 deaths.</p><blockquote><p>God told his son it\u2019s time to come home<br>I promise you won\u2019t have to die all alone<br>I need you to pay for the sins I create<br>Son said I will but dad I\u2019m afraid</p></blockquote><p>Jon\u2019s no Jesus, but he\u2019s the closest thing to a sacrificial lamb this show has. He\u2019s already died once and risen for the sins of others.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/u2-love-is-blindness-lyrics-h7k29dm.html\">Love is Blindness - U2</a></h2><p>Dany and Jon. Period.</p><blockquote><p>Love is blindness<br>I don\u2019t want to see<br>Won\u2019t you wrap the night<br>Around me<br>Oh my heart<br>Love is blindness</p></blockquote><p>They don\u2019t want to know what they know about Jon\u2019s parentage. It\u2019s as simple as that. It changed everything for them.</p><hr><p>And that\u2019s all she wrote. Agree, disagree\u2026 thoughts? I\u2019d really like to know what other people think.</p>",
                "content": "<p>OK, In early Spring, D.B. Weiss and Daniel Benioff helped create a new Spotify playlist: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXdnZT5DhATDx?si=Fm6C_nfHShCGLFHVluC5qQ\"><i>Game of Thrones</i>: The End Is Coming</a>. Upon doing so, they told For the Record in an email, &ldquo;The answer to the ending is one hundred percent hidden in the playlist choices. No one will believe us, but it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p><p>I have spent the last couple of weeks going through each song and trying to figure out which character, which scenario, arc, storyline each song was about. I could be completely way-off, but it was fun. So here you. Enjoy! (Note: All songs link to full lyrics.)</p><p>Fair warning, this is long. Very long. So long that I&rsquo;m going to put a cut. I will say&hellip; yeah, this playlist screams Gendrya endgame.</p><p><br /></p><h2><a href=\"denied:ttps://www.lyricsbox.com/rage-against-the-machine-sleep-now-in-the-fire-lyrics-72b191k.html\">Sleep Now in the Fire - Rage Against the Machine</a>&nbsp;</h2><p>Dany as Mad Queen.<br /></p><blockquote><p>The world is my expense<br />The cost of my desire<br />Jesus blessed me with its future<br />And I protect it with fire<br />So raise your fists and march around<br />Dont dare take what you need<br />I&rsquo;ll jail and bury those committed<br />And smother the rest in greed<br />Crawl with me into tomorrow<br />Or i&rsquo;ll drag you to your grave<br />I&rsquo;m deep inside your children<br />They&rsquo;ll betray you in my name </p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/danzig-her-black-wings-lyrics-4x87flw.html\">Her Black Wings - Danzig</a></h2><p>This one seems to fit Arya in the first three episodes of the season.</p><blockquote><p>She brings the lust<br />Supernatural<br />Ceasing never<br />On and<br />On and<br />On<br />Her stride is such<br />Mortals freeze<br />When she walks past<br />And she comes down to me<br />And she offers me sleep<br />Under her black wings</p></blockquote><p>Think about Arya flying down to kill the Night King, that fits with the &ldquo;Under her black wings.&rdquo; And &ldquo;Mortals freeze when she falls by\" and the mention of the &ldquo;supernatural,&rdquo; all fit the Faceless men training and her overall ability to walk silent and her skills.</p><blockquote><p>Entwined with love<br />Unclean she is</p></blockquote><p>Everything Arya is doing, everything that she has done, every kill has been done for love, to avenge the people she loves, to protect those she loves. And yet, she&rsquo;s so surrounded, covered, engulfed in death that she&rsquo;s unclean.</p><blockquote><p>See she comes<br />Blacker than pitch<br />Have to make this fallen bitch<br />All I want<br />All I crave<br />Demoness calls<br />The bitch is come<br />For those who wait<br />Cross the breach in hell<br />See she is<br />Bedeviled with breasts<br />Enchantment on legs</p></blockquote><p>This stanza here even fits her if you take into account the fact that the Hound calls her a bitch all the time, and the last two lines, well, we do see Arya as a woman for the first time this season. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/led-zeppelin-immigrant-song-lyrics-lvxdt1w.html\">Immigrant Song (Remaster) - Led Zeppelin</a></h2><p>\n\nThe Army of the Undead want to take over Westeros.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-doors-end-lyrics-pr4s3dw.html\">The End (Remaster) - The Doors</a></h2><p>The could certainly be about Jaime and Cersei, but something about it just says the Hound and Arya to me because of a line in the final stanza: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never follow me&rdquo; and that obviously does not apply to the twins. Plus, there is a reference to a &ldquo;Stranger&rdquo; in the song. The Hound&rsquo;s horse was &ldquo;Stranger&rdquo; and, of course, as has been established this season, the Hound=death and in the faith of the Seven, the Stranger represents death.</p><blockquote><p>This is the end<br />Beautiful friend<br />This is the end<br />My only friend</p><p>The end<br />Of our elaborate plans<br />The end<br />Of everything that stands<br />The end<br />No safety or surprise<br />The end<br />I&rsquo;ll never look into your eyes<br />Again</p><p>Can you picture what will be<br />So limitless and free<br />Desperately in need of some stranger&rsquo;s hand<br />In a desperate land</p></blockquote><p>Arya is the Hound&rsquo;s only friend, and in many ways, he&rsquo;s Arya&rsquo;s only friend now that Gendry has become something more. It&rsquo;s the end of their journey together. </p><p>There is this stanza which is why one could think it references Jaime and Cersei with the references to father, brother and sister:</p><blockquote><p>The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on<br />He took a face from the ancient gallery<br />And he walked on down the hall<br />He went into the room where his sister lived, and&hellip;then he<br />Paid a visit to his brother, and then he<br />He walked on down the hall, and<br />And he came to a door&hellip;and he looked inside<br />&ldquo;Father?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, son.&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to kill you.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Mother, I want to&hellip;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>But I took that as more allegorical, the Hound being the killer who is ready to finally kill his family, i.e., his brother. </p><p>And then we come to the end of the song and it is full of profanity after profanity, the Hound&rsquo;s calling card before leading to death and then those lines that just scream the Hound to Arya.</p><blockquote><p>Fuck, fuck-ah, yeah<br />Fuck<br />Fuck<br />Fuck, fuck<br />Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah<br />C'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah<br />Fuck me, baby, fuck yeah<br />Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah!<br />Fuck, yeah! C'mon, baby<br />Fuck me, baby, fuck, fuck, yeah<br />Whoa, whoa, yeah, fuck, baby<br />C'mon, yeah, huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah<br />All right</p><p>Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill</p><p>This is the end<br />Beautiful friend<br />This is the end<br />My only friend, the end</p><p><b>It hurts to set you free<br />But you&rsquo;ll never follow me</b><br />The end of laughter and soft lies<br /><b>The end of nights we tried to die</b></p><p>This is the end</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/bob-dylan-feat.-johnny-cash-girl-from-the-north-country-lyrics-wlck3j6.html\">Girl From the North Country - Bob Dylan</a></h2><p>Yes, I know there is a line in this song that references the girl&rsquo;s long hair lying past her breast, but regardless, everything else about this song just screams pre-season Gendry and Arya. &nbsp;It totally, totally does. It just totally is Gendry pining for Arya. Nothing else makes sense. N-O-T-H-I-N-G!&nbsp;</p><p>I know that some have tried to fit it with Sansa and Tyrion, and I love them, but it just doesn&rsquo;t fit them. Sansa is in no way Tyrion&rsquo;s true love, she just isn&rsquo;t. He hasn&rsquo;t been thinking of her throughout his time away from her. We know that. We absolutely know that. It does not fit them, sorry Sanrion fans (I&rsquo;m one of them).</p><p>Now, if there is some time jump that we see in episode 06 before Arya goes to Gendry (because, yes, I&rsquo;m still convinced that we are getting an Arya/Gendry endgame), then maybe this will apply to *that* timeframe, but as of now, I still see it as pre-season 08 Gendrya, just the feeling, the tenor and tone of it. Think of Gendry&rsquo;s line to her in the second episode:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The last time you saw me, you asked me to come to Winterfell. I took the long road&hellip; </p></blockquote><p>Yeah. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/guns-n-roses-mama-kin-lyrics-fq4j59q.html\">Mama Kin (Live Version) - Guns n Roses</a></h2><p>(FYI: These are the lyrics for the live version, so they may differ slightly.)</p><p>I believe this one is about Cersei and how her life has been spent living a lie, putting on a show, but it&rsquo;s all just that, a show.</p><blockquote><p>losin&rsquo; touch with all that&rsquo;s real<br />Whole lotta lover, keepin&rsquo; undercover</p></blockquote><p>Cersei so often just can&rsquo;t face the reality of all the shit going on around her, through most of her relationship with Jaime, she kept that a secret and even kept her other lovers a secret from him. </p><blockquote><p>You&rsquo;ve been fadin&rsquo;, always out paradin&rsquo;</p></blockquote><p>Cersei has always been hiding who she really is, pretending to be the perfect queen, the perfect wife, perfect mother.</p><blockquote><p>Spittin&rsquo; fire from your mouth just like a dragon</p></blockquote><p>She does incest like the Targaryens. She&rsquo;s crazy like the Targaryens, but she&rsquo;s not a Targaryen. </p><blockquote><p>You better check it out &lsquo;cause someday soon<br />You&rsquo;ll have to climb back on the wagon</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not going to last, she&rsquo;s not going to get her happy ending. (Duh.)</p><blockquote><p>It ain&rsquo;t easy livin&rsquo; like you want to</p></blockquote><p>She became the queen, the ruler of the seven kingdoms, but NOTHING has come easy and it&rsquo;s still hard for and she never had peace or happiness.</p><blockquote><p>And workin&rsquo; for daddy&rsquo;s such a drag<br />You still stuff your mouth With his beans</p></blockquote><p>She as always under Twyin&rsquo;s control, she hated it, but she was always under his thumb, always playing by his rules.</p><p>This was all about Cersei not being good enough, wanting more, but never getting it, giving up everything and never getting it. She should have cherished what mattered, but she didn&rsquo;t and lost everything consequently.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitestripes/sevennationarmy.html\">Seven Nation Army - The White Stripes&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Dany as Mad Queen. Now, this could have been about Cersei, but there&rsquo;s a line that screams treason, so&hellip; Dany.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nI&rsquo;m gonna fight &lsquo;em off<br />A seven nation army couldn&rsquo;t hold me back<br />They&rsquo;re gonna rip it off<br /><b>Taking their time right behind my back</b><br />And I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to myself at night<br />Because I can&rsquo;t forget<br />Back and forth through my mind\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blackkeys/howlinforyou.html\">Howlin For You - The Black Keys</a></h2><p>\n\nThis is so obviously Gendry about Arya that they might as well have revealed it as such after episode 02 in the &ldquo;Inside the Episode&rdquo; video.\n\n<br /></p><blockquote><p>I must admit<br />I can&rsquo;t explain<br />Any of these thoughts racing<br />Through my brain</p><p>It&rsquo;s true<br />Baby I&rsquo;m howlin&rsquo; for you</p><p>Can&rsquo;t you see<br />Little girl&rsquo;s<br />Got a hold on me</p><p>Like glue<br />Baby I&rsquo;m howlin&rsquo; for you</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/grandson/war.html\">War - Grandson</a>&nbsp;</h2><p>Pretty clearly about the war against the Undead.</p><h2><a href=\"https://genius.com/Des-rocs-let-me-live-let-me-die-lyrics\">Let Me Live/Let Me Die - Des Rocs</a></h2><p>Arya again, specifically with Beric sacrificing himself to save her and then her going to kill the Night King.</p><blockquote><p>I know pain, I know dread<br />Wicked veins, they turn to lead<br />Tears don&rsquo;t stop the fire<br />It&rsquo;s killing time</p><p>Back from the dead<br />See, their eyes got nothing left<br />Kiss me, I am the cobra<br />It&rsquo;s killing time</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://lyricstranslate.com/en/flugufrelsarinn-flys-savior.html-0\">Flugufrelsarinn - Sigur Ros</a></h2><p>This was in another language, I read the translation and I&rsquo;m so not sure, but I&rsquo;m thinking maybe Grey Worm and Missandei&hellip;</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tommorello/cantstopthebleeding.html\">Can&rsquo;t Stop The Bleeding - Tom Morello feat. Gary Clark Jr. and Gramatik</a></h2><p>I think this is Tyrion realizing that Dany is not the one. Interestingly enough, prior to last week, this song was NOT on the playlist. There were only 50 songs and then, boom!, this one was added.</p><blockquote><p>Can&rsquo;t stop the bleeding, calling<br />Can&rsquo;t stop the bleeding, oh</p><p>Fill my soul, it&rsquo;s hard to see<br />Trouble found and trouble lost<br />20 miles dark and deep<br />Trouble paid and trouble bought, uh</p><p>Frayed like myth, every fool caught it<br />Sound like this, every fool bought it</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion was duped into believing that Daenerys was the Princess that was Promised, and I think he&rsquo;s going to something drastic about it.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/barns-courtney-fire-lyrics-lzk3qcl.html\">Fire - Barns Courtney</a></h2><p>Ceganebowl!</p><blockquote><p>Oh, a thousand faces staring at me<br />Thousand times I&rsquo;ve fallen<br />Thousand voices dead at my feet<br />Now I&rsquo;m gone, now I&rsquo;m gone, now I&rsquo;m gone</p><p>And my mother told me, &ldquo;Son, let it be.&rdquo;<br />Sold my soul to the calling<br />Sold my soul to a sweet melody<br />Now I&rsquo;m gone, now I&rsquo;m gone, now I&rsquo;m gone</p><p>Oh, gimme that fire<br />Oh, gimme that fire<br />Oh, gimme that fire<br />Burn, burn, burn</p></blockquote><p>The mother in the song is metaphorical or one could take it as the Mother of the New Gods and the Mother stands, among other things, for mercy and peace. And we all know that the Hound is not going to 'Let it be\" so it&rsquo;s pretty clear that this is the Hound facing his deepest fear&ndash;diving headfirst into fire&ndash;at the same time finally getting his soul&rsquo;s desire and taking out his brother.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/missio-bottom-of-the-deep-blue-sea-lyrics-fr61lsv.html\">Bottom of the Deep Blue Sea - MISSIO</a></h2><p>The pretty gross relationship between Euron and Cersei, and after episode 05, more specifically, the demise of Euron Greyjoy! (The crowd cheers!)</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pixies/waveofmutilation.html\">Wave of Mutilation - Pixies</a>&nbsp;</h2><p>This one&rsquo;s about Theon.</p><blockquote><p>cease to resist, giving my goodbye<br />drive my car into the ocean<br />you&rsquo;ll think i&rsquo;m dead, but i sail away<br />on a wave of mutilation<br />a wave<br />wave</p><p>i&rsquo;ve kissed mermaids, rode the el nino<br />walked the sand with the crustaceans<br />could find my way to mariana<br />on a wave of mutilation,<br />wave of mutilation<br />wave of mutilation<br />wave</p></blockquote><p>Saying goodbye to Yara, the ocean references, &ldquo;What is dead may never die&rdquo; = &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll think i&rsquo;m dead, but i sail away,&rdquo; the mutilation\" theme. &nbsp;Yeah, good ole Theon.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/tv-on-the-radio-wolf-like-me-lyrics-w66mmbn.html\">Wolf Like Me - TV On the Radio</a></h2><p>I think this is about Sansa to Tyrion, using him to get to Dany.</p><blockquote><p>Say<br />Say my playmate<br />Won&rsquo;t you lay your hands on me<br />Mirror my malady<br />Transfer my tragedy</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Playmate&rdquo; as in someone who is playing the 'game&rsquo; with her, and the final two lines, the two of them sharing their fears, their miseries, knowing what the other has been through.</p><blockquote><p>We could jet in a stolen car<br />But I bet we wouldn&rsquo;t get too far<br />Before the transformation takes<br />And bloodlust tanks and<br />Crave gets slaked</p></blockquote><p>They could work together, maybe even try marriage again, but both of them know it wouldn&rsquo;t last because there are too many ambitions and lusts and powerplays going on, not necessarily just within them but around them.</p><blockquote><p>My mind has changed<br />My body&rsquo;s frame but god I like it<br />My hearts aflame<br />My body&rsquo;s strained but god I like it</p></blockquote><p>Sansa has become stronger and smarter, she&rsquo;s changed and it&rsquo;s been hard and it&rsquo;s still hard, but she likes it.</p><blockquote><p>Gonna teach you tricks that&rsquo;ll blow your<br />Mongrel mind<br />Baby doll I recognize<br />You&rsquo;re a hideous thing inside<br />If ever there were a lucky kind it&rsquo;s<br />You you you you</p></blockquote><p>She recognizes his flaws, where she can manipulate him now because she learned from Cersei and Littlefinger, and she knows that it wasn&rsquo;t just his brains that got him this far, but he&rsquo;s had luck help him too. Of course, Tyrion is not a &ldquo;hideous thing inside&rdquo; and I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s how Sansa sees him, but this whole section is how she manipulated him, how she used him, because she did. It&rsquo;s about her being able to manipulate him as Cersei and Littlefinger taught her. The only truly hideous characters inside left this season were Euron and Cersei and none of the Starks would have interacted with them to fit this song; that was just one part of the song that was definitely metaphorical.</p><blockquote><p>Writhing under your riding hood</p></blockquote><p>I just think that the reference to &ldquo;riding hood&rdquo; was a key to this being about Sansa with the immediate jump to &ldquo;red&rdquo; from that phrase and Sansa&rsquo;s red hair.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kanyewest/power.html\">POWER - Kanye West</a></h2><p>The best I can make of this is that it&rsquo;s about Sansa getting through all that she has been through to be in control where she is and she&rsquo;s now determined that one person is not going to be in power of all of them, especially not the North. </p><blockquote><p>Rumble young man, rumble<br />Life is a trip so sometimes we gon&rsquo; stumble<br />You gotta go through pain in order to become you<br />But once the world numbs you, you&rsquo;ll feel like it&rsquo;s only one you<br />Man, you got the power to do anything you want to<br />Until you ask yourself, &ldquo;Is that what it&rsquo;s all come to?&rdquo;<br />Looking at life through sunglasses in the sunroof<br />Do you have the power to get out from up under you<br />Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you</p></blockquote><p>I could be totally and absolutely wrong with this one.&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/fear-let-s-have-a-war-lyrics-mvjxsgz.html\">Let&rsquo;s Have a War - Fear</a></h2><p>Cersei&rsquo;s perspective re: the battle of King&rsquo;s Landing.</p><blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s so many of us<br />There&rsquo;s so many of us<br />There&rsquo;s so many<br />There&rsquo;s so many of us<br />There&rsquo;s so many of us<br />There&rsquo;s so many</p><p>Let&rsquo;s have a war<br />So you can go and die<br />Let&rsquo;s have a war<br />We could all use the money</p><p>Let&rsquo;s have a war<br />We need the space<br />Let&rsquo;s have a war<br />Clean out this place</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/tune-yards-powa-lyrics-rzhqcx7.html\">Powa - Tune-Yards</a>&nbsp;</h2><p>Dany breaking her promise to Tyrion about burning King&rsquo;s Landing if the bells rang.</p><blockquote><p>Rebel, rebel, no<br />Lightening dances in my head<br />Devil, devil, whoa, oh, oh<br />Burning steady as a motor</p><p>[&hellip;]</p><p>'Cause you bomb me with lies,<br />humiliations everyday<br />You bomb me so many times</p><p>I never find my way<br />Come on and bomb me<br />Why won&rsquo;t you bomb me?<br />Come on and bomb<br />Go on and whoa</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/van-morrison-listen-to-the-lion-lyrics-nsv5jl5.html\">Listen to the Lion - Van Morrison</a></h2><p>The first half of this just screams the end of Jaime and Cersei:</p><blockquote><p>And all my love come down<br />All my love come tumblin&rsquo; down<br />All my love come tumblin&rsquo; down<br />All my love come tumblin&rsquo; down<br />Oh, listen listen<br />To the lion<br />Oh, listen listen listen<br />To the lion&hellip;<br />Inside of me<br />Oh, oh, oh</p><p>And I shall search my soul<br />I shall search my very soul<br />And I shall search my very soul<br />I shall search my very so-o-oul</p><p>For the lion<br />For the lion<br />For the lion<br />For the lion&hellip;<br />Inside of me<br />Oh, oh, yeah</p><p>And all my tears have flown<br />All my tears like water flown</p></blockquote><p>Right? That&rsquo;s their end. Things literally came tumbling down on them, the lion inside Cersei, the Lannister sigil is the Lion, she&rsquo;s pregnant with their last child. All tears have flown because they gonna die, can&rsquo;t cry no more, right? So, obviously this song is about the end of Jaime and Cersei, except&hellip; for the next part of the song.</p><blockquote><p>And we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br />And we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br />And we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br />&hellip; sailed to Caledonia</p><p>And we sailed, and we sailed,<br />And we sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br />Away from Denmark<br />Way up to Caledonia<br />Away from Denmark<br />Way up to Caledonia</p><p>And we sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed&hellip;<br />All around the World<br />And we sailed&hellip;, and we sailed&hellip;, and we sailed&hellip;<br />Looking for a brand new start</p></blockquote><p>(They sailed to a few more places, but you get the point.) So, clearly Jaime and Cersei aren&rsquo;t doing that&hellip; unless, they did somehow escape those tumbling rocks and we&rsquo;ll see them in the final episode, then, yeah, this song *is* about them. If not and they do be dead and gone, then, well, yeah, I could see this song being about Ser Brienne of Tarth. Because the first part of the song would totally fit her too&hellip; if she, like Cersei, had a Jaime Lannister Lion inside her. Uh huh.</p><p>We shall see. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/cage-the-elephant-cold-cold-cold-lyrics-h8tfkj4.html\">Cold Cold Cold - Cage the Elephants</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;m thinking this one&rsquo;s about Jon and his conflict over his identity, because&nbsp;first off we start early on with this line:</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been breathing air but there&rsquo;s no sign of life</p></blockquote><p>Jon, technically, isn&rsquo;t alive, being a fire wight and all, so, I&rsquo;m just saying.</p><blockquote><p>Tell me how hard will I fall if I live a double life</p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow / Aegon Targaryen. Uh huh.</p><blockquote><p>And as the darkness falls it fills up both my eyes<br />My life before me like a flash in the night<br />With my arms open wide</p><p>Well it&rsquo;s cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br />Cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br />Cold, cold, cold, cold inside<br />Doctor can you help me cause something don&rsquo;t feel right<br />Something don&rsquo;t feel right, something just ain&rsquo;t right</p></blockquote><p>He found out all of this right before the Long Night.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/queens-of-the-stone-age-no-one-knows-lyrics-qtbj71l.html\">No One Knows - Queens of the Stone Age</a></h2><p>This is absolutely about Arya and the whole the Hound=Death and Gendry=Life theory.</p><blockquote><p>And I realize you&rsquo;re mine<br />Indeed a fool am I<br />And I realize you&rsquo;re mine<br />Indeed a fool am I<br />Ahh</p></blockquote><p>Gendry proposed, offered himself to her, asked her to be with him&hellip; and she totes is gonna realize that she was a fool because he is hers.</p><blockquote><p>Heaven smiles above me<br />What a gift here below<br />But no one knows<br />A gift that you give to me<br />No one knows</p></blockquote><p>The Hound gave Arya a gift, he made her realize that it&rsquo;s time to LIVE her life, instead of dying everyday just waiting for death. Once upon a time, Arya was No One. Yuppers.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/biffyclyro/wolvesofwinter.html\">Wolves of Winter - Biffy Clyro</a></h2><p>This has got to be Sansa giving some straight talk to Dany.</p><blockquote><p>Justify your reasons, now it is my turn<br />We are the wolves!<br />How&rsquo;s it gonna feel when there&rsquo;s no one to support ya?<br />How&rsquo;s it gonna feel when you&rsquo;re standing there alone?</p><p>We have achieved so much more than you possibly thought we could<br />(I love that you&rsquo;re seething)<br />You can achieve anything, just remember no I in team<br />(But there&rsquo;s two in brilliant)<br />We are the wolves of winter<br />We live in a kingdom of blood</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nothingmore/gotowar.html\">Go to War - Nothing More</a></h2><p>Dany to Jon episode 04 is what this is feels like this is referencing.</p><blockquote><p>Screaming at the ones we love<br />Like we forgot who we can trust<br />Screaming at the top of our lungs<br />On the grounds where we feel safe<br />Do we feel safe?<br />Do we feel safe?</p></blockquote><p>She&rsquo;s lost so many people and feels like those she has she can&rsquo;t completely trust. She doesn&rsquo;t feel safe.</p><blockquote><p>Hush, my baby, make no sound<br />Maybe we can wait each other out<br />It&rsquo;s a cold war<br />Let&rsquo;s go to war</p><p>With every settled score<br />I thought that fighting with meant fighting for<br />But you turn it around<br />But you turn it around<br />(War, war, war!)</p></blockquote><p>She doesn&rsquo;t feel she has anyone completely on her side anymore.</p><blockquote><p>Every feeling in my bones<br />Tells me to lash out and tell you to fuck off<br />You&rsquo;ve got my heart and I&rsquo;ve got your soul<br />But are we better off alone?<br />With every battle we lose a little more<br />Remember everything that we&rsquo;d die for<br />You are everything that I&rsquo;d die for</p></blockquote><p>Dany still loves and wants Jon, but Jon no longer can love her like *that.* And Dany keeps losing more and more with every battle, and she hasn&rsquo;t forgotten what she&rsquo;s fighting and what everyone that she loves has died for.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/royalblood/littlemonster.html\">Little Monster - Royal Blood</a></h2><p>I think this one is about Jon taking on Tyrion.</p><blockquote><p>Hey little monster, I got my eye on you<br />Where are you going, where you running to?<br />Hey little monster, you know it&rsquo;s all ok<br />I&rsquo;m gonna love you, no matter what you say</p></blockquote><p>I think this may be about Jon and Tyrion trying to come to terms with what Dany is doing before they part ways on how to deal with her IF my speculation is correct that Tyrion winds up killing her to protect the realm. And then from that point on, things change between Jon and Tyrion. The next part of the song is more about Jon&rsquo;s feelings for Dany and how Tyrion is going to see the Wolf in Jon Snow.</p><blockquote><p>I got love on my fingers<br />Lust on my tongue<br />You say you got nothing,<br />So come out and get some<br />Heartache to Heartache,<br />I&rsquo;m your wolf- I&rsquo;m your man<br />I say run little monster,<br />Before you know who I am</p></blockquote><p>Jon had Daenerys&rsquo; love and Tyrion didn&rsquo;t. Tyrion took Dany out to protect the realm and Jon understands that it came from a place from honor and that Tyrion loved Dany, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, Jon is going to show avenge her.</p><p>I could be totes wrong, though. We&rsquo;ll find out tomorrow!</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thrice/burnthefleet.html\">Burn the Fleet - Thrice</a></h2><p>This is the first attack on King&rsquo;s Landing.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/prince/sister.html\">Sister - Prince</a></h2><p>Uhm, yeah, just read the lyrics.

Tyrion is still trying to make amends, as is Jaime.</p><blockquote><p>Mother, it&rsquo;s not in my hands<br />Try to understand, it&rsquo;s only 'cause I can<br />Fools believe they can erase<br />All that they&rsquo;ve done before</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion telling the Mother&ndash;as in one of the Seven&ndash;that he is still trying to believe he can make up for his past sins and mistakes.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/kaleo-hot-blood-lyrics-x64xl9m.html\">Hot Blood - KALEO</a></h2><p>Jon&rsquo;s conflict and shame over his love for Dany, his aunt.</p><blockquote><p>You turn your back, you&rsquo;re a broken man<br />You come around and just dying to shake your hand<br />I don&rsquo;t expect you to understand<br />Just keep telling yourself there&rsquo;s no shame</p></blockquote><p>This was when he was still trying to convince himself it was OK, but then, of course he pulled away from their kiss.</p><blockquote><p>They don&rsquo;t know 'bout who we are<br />They don&rsquo;t know 'bout you and I<br />They ain&rsquo;t know 'bout the stars of your eyes<br />Oh hot blood love is gonna get ya</p></blockquote><p>Before the secret was out&hellip;</p><blockquote><p>You wanna prove you&rsquo;re the better man<br />You wanna reach for the things that nobody can<br />Oh all you need is to break away, yeah<br />Just keep telling yourself there&rsquo;s no shame </p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen is a honorable man just like his real father, Ned Stark, and nothing can change that.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/black-sabbath-luke-s-wall-war-pigs-lyrics-v7l3pbn.html\">War Pigs/Luke&rsquo;s Wall - Black Sabbath</a></h2><p>The end of Cersei who never cared about any of her subjects.</p><blockquote><p>Politicians hide themselves away<br />They only started the war<br />Why should they go out to fight?</p></blockquote><p>Cersei until nearly the very end up there safe in her tower watching all of the bloodshed and destruction.</p><blockquote><p>They leave that role for the poor, yeah<br />Time will tell on their power minds,<br />Making war just for fun<br />Treating people just like pawns in chess,<br />Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah</p></blockquote><p>She could have helped, she knew that by playing her games, thousands and thousands of people could and would die, but she didn&rsquo;t care.</p><blockquote><p>Now in darkness world stops turning,<br />Ashes where the bodies burning<br />No more War Pigs have the power,<br />Hand of God has struck the hour<br />Day of judgement, God is calling<br />On their knees the war pigs crawling,<br />Begging mercies for their sins<br />Satan, laughing, spreads his wings </p></blockquote><p>The end of Cersei, ashes falling, bodies burning.

So many screams that she has listened to, and we all know that temptation has taken over, no more control, rationale is gone.</p><blockquote><p>Empty eyes enslave the creations<br />Of placid faces and lifeless pageants<br />In the depths of a mind insane<br />Fantasy and reality are the same</p></blockquote><p>The coin has landed on the side of insanity.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/danzig-killer-wolf-lyrics-h4qjmj7.html\">Killer Wolf - Danzig</a></h2><p>Arya and her awesome power, as a killer, as a woman (see: one smitten Gendry err <strike>Rivers</strike> Baratheon).</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m the wolf<br />I&rsquo;m the one you want<br />I&rsquo;m the killer wolf<br />I&rsquo;m 'onna pound you home<br />I&rsquo;m the wolf<br />Howlin&rsquo; all night<br />I curl up next to you<br />When you&rsquo;re all alone</p></blockquote><p>How her deadly abilities, her killer ways have become so much a part of who she is.</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m the wolf<br />Howlin&rsquo; all night<br />I&rsquo;m the king wolf<br />I put the chill in your bones<br />I&rsquo;m the wolf<br />Hunting you down<br />I ain&rsquo;t no back door wolf<br />I don&rsquo;t scratch at no doors</p></blockquote><p>She has no fear, she&rsquo;s in control, and numb to the world in generally for the most part.</p><blockquote><p>Just one kiss, yes<br />From my lips<br />Rake your soul<br />Over burning coals<br />Just one touch, yes<br />From my love<br />Make you howl<br />'Til the sun comes up<br />I&rsquo;m the wolf</p></blockquote><p>And how with a few well-placed comments, eyebrow lifts, sultry looks and deadly knife throws gets Gendry all hot and bothered like that. Boy&rsquo;s just gone for her. In the immortal words of Joe Dempsie, he&rsquo;s spruuuung!</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/atreyu-the-time-is-now-lyrics-vhshqv6.html\">The Time Is Now - Atreyu</a></h2><p>I just can&rsquo;t see this being about anything other than Arya after episode 05 being ready to start a new life&ndash;one that is not about death. And since I firmly believe that the Hound=Death, and Gendry=life, and both are crazy entangled up with Arya this season, that therefore means the new life she starts will be with Gendry.</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been dreaming 'bout, hope for better days<br />Time for dreaming&rsquo;s done, time to face the sun</p><p>(Flying high above the world)<br />It&rsquo;s a new life, it&rsquo;s a new mind<br />And I will never fall</p></blockquote><p>Arya rode away on that white horse, flying high and you know she will not fall. It&rsquo;s just too hopeful and happy to be about Daenerys.</p><blockquote><p>(The time is now)<br />I can&rsquo;t contain myself, I never felt so alive<br />(The time is now)<br />I&rsquo;m past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I never felt so alive&hellip;&rdquo; For the first time, Arya has given herself permission to live.</p><blockquote><p>(Hey-ay, hey-ay, hey-ay, yeah)<br />The time is now!</p></blockquote><p>Yup, the time is now.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.songlyrics.com/the-blue-stones/be-my-fire-lyrics/\">Be My Fire - The Blue Stones</a></h2><p>Dany wanting so much for Jon to still love her as his love, wanting him to trust her, to be true to her, to be with her forever.</p><blockquote><p>Baby, be my fire<br />Baby, be my flame<br />Baby, be the softly burning embers</p><p>You need a man in whom<br />You can depend<br />Well I&rsquo;d be the gasoline<br />To keep you alive<br />And I&rsquo;d be the cold<br />So unbreakable<br />We&rsquo;d burn together<br />Straight through the night<br />That&rsquo;s alright<br />Baby, be my fire</p></blockquote><p>Yes, it says &ldquo;man,&rdquo; but eh, the point still gets across. I think this is about them. I think.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/black-flag-rise-above-lyrics-9b7hfjq.html\">Rise Above - Black Flag</a></h2><p>I think this is about Sansa and representing the North wanting their independence back.</p><blockquote><p>we are tired of your abuse<br />try to stop us but its no use</p><p>societys arm&rsquo;s out of control<br />rise above we&rsquo;re gonna rise above<br />think there smart cant think for themselves<br />rise above we&rsquo;re gonna rise above<br />laugh at us behind our backs<br />rise above we&rsquo;re gonna rise above<br />i find satisfaction in what they lack<br />rise above we&rsquo;re gonna rise above</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/40984/\">Alternative Ulster - Stiff Little Fingers</a></h2><p>I had no clue what this song was about&hellip; I had to go to Song Meanings since I&rsquo;m not from Ireland and don&rsquo;t know much about the politics, the Punk Rock scen or the political dynamics going on there. The bottom line is that this song is about seeing beyond the divisions. Therefore, this song&hellip; is Jon&rsquo;s point of view. We all are in this together: The Living against the Undead.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/born_ruffians/this_sentence_will_ruinsave_your_life-lyrics-1135073.html\">This Sentence Will Ruin/Save Your Life - Young Ruffians</a></h2><p>This whole song is about someone trying to figure things out. It&rsquo;s about someone who frankly knows nothing&hellip; so, uhm, yeah, Jon Snow, and his identity crisis and trying to figure out what the fuck to do.</p><blockquote><p>I need to know who I am<br />and what I&rsquo;m going to do while I&rsquo;m on earth<br />I need to understand<br />everything and everybody&rsquo;s lives</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-pogues-the-sick-bed-of-cuchulainn-lyrics-vn93g59.html\">The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn - The Pogues</a></h2><p>This one&rsquo;s about Tyrion&hellip; the song is very Celtic with lots of history about the people. Basically, it&rsquo;s about the urge to self-destruct and about a man&rsquo;s life-long descent into alcoholism. SO, yeah, Tyrion.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/neil-young-winterlong-lyrics-hgfg4d1.html\">Winterlong - Neil Young</a></h2><p>Well, this certainly seems to apply to Gendry after Arya turned down his proposal. Very promising though is the fact that nothing in the song is definite. It was all &ldquo;if&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;you seem to be&hellip;&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>I waited for you, Winterlong<br />You seem to be where I belong.<br />It&rsquo;s all illusion anyway.</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;You seem&hellip;&rdquo; that leaves it to open, the possibility of her coming back is not closed off. The &ldquo;illusion&rdquo; could refer to the title and castle.</p><blockquote><p>If things should ever turn out wrong<br />And all the love we have is gone,<br />It won&rsquo;t be easy on that day.</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;If&rdquo; and &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be easy <b>on that day</b>&rdquo; makes it clear he hasn&rsquo;t given up, he&rsquo;s still waiting for his girl to come to him.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/blitzen-trapper-furr-lyrics-n5562tm.html\">Furr - Blitzen Trapper</a></h2><p>OK, guys, this is it. I know I keep saying it, but yeah, Arya and Gendry? Are absolutely endgame. This song sounds absolutely like Arya deciding to give up her Stark-ways, being the killer with a list, etc. and joining Gendry. I mean, for reals! I&rsquo;m just putting all the lyrics here bolding key phrases.</p><blockquote><p>Yeah, when I was only 17,<br /><b>I could hear the angels whispering</b><br />So I droned into the words and<br />Wondered aimlessly about till<br />I<b> heard my mother shouting through the fog<br />It turned out to be the howling of a dog<br />Or a wolf to be exact.<br />The sound sent shivers down my back<br />But I was drawn into the pack.</b><br />And before long, they allowed me<br />To join in and sing their song.<br />So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah<br />We would gladly get our fill,<br />Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn.<br /><b>And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong.<br />For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah<br />And my thoughts, they surely were turned to<br />Instinct and obedience to God.</b></p><p>[Chorus]<br />You can wear your fur<br />Like the river on fire.<br />But you better be sure<br />If you&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; God a liar.<br />I&rsquo;m a rattlesnake, babe,<br />I&rsquo;m like fuel on fire.<br />So if you&rsquo;re gonna&rsquo; get made,<br />Don&rsquo;t be afraid of what you&rsquo;ve learned.</p><p>On the day that I turned 23,<br /><b>I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree.<br />When suddenly a girl</b><br />With skin the color of a pearl,<br /><b>Wandered aimlessly,<br />But she didn&rsquo;t seem to see.<br />She was listenin&rsquo; for the angels just like me.</b><br /><b>So I stood and looked about.<br />I brushed the leaves off of my snout.<br />And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees.<br />You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees.<br />So I took her by the arm<br />We settled down upon a farm.<br />And raised our children up as<br />Gently as you pleased.</b></p><p><b>And now my fur has turned to skin.<br />And I&rsquo;ve been quickly ushered in<br />To a world that I confess I do not know.<br />But I still dream of running careless through the snow.</b><br />An&rsquo; through the howlin&rsquo; winds that blow,<br />Across the ancient distant flow,<br />It fill our bodies up like water till we know.</p><p>[Chorus]</p></blockquote><p>OK, now aside from the very, very obviousness of the fact that if you switch the genders&ndash;which, when a song THIS PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATES Arya and Gendry&rsquo;s story with references to wolves and packs and settling in a farm (forest lass), etc. one can not worry about the gender not matching perfectly&ndash;there&rsquo;s another very key thing one has to bear in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The song is called &ldquo;Furr.&rdquo; That title clearly references the narrator (who in this case would be Arya) being a wolf. The group name is Blitzen Trapper. Blitzen is, of course, famously known as one of the reindeer who pulled Santa&rsquo;s sleigh. While science has now proven that all of Santa&rsquo;s reindeer were likely female as male reindeer shed their antlers in December, it is highly unlikely that when the tale was first told that such was known therefore we&rsquo;re going with the original conception that Blitzen is indeed male. And since Blitzen is known as a male reindeer, well, another name for a male deer is a&hellip; stag. So, not only does the song itself alone scream an Arya and Gendrya endgame (it really, really, REALLY does). </p><p>The group name + the song title + the meaning of the song = <b>The Stag caught the Wolf with his love. &nbsp;</b></p><p>At this point, let me remind ya&rsquo;ll that Benioff and Weiss said about this playlist, &ldquo;The answer to the ending is one hundred percent hidden in the playlist choices. No one will believe us, but it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Uh huh. I believe you!</p><h2>Power - AJ Ghent&nbsp;</h2><p>There are no lyrics for this one, so I just listened to it and really, I think it might be the beginning of the season when Dany was feeling confident about taking on the Army of the Dead and Cersei. OR it could be Cersei feeling confident about taking on Dany with her greater numbers. It&rsquo;s easier to analyze it when you can look at the lyrics. :shrugs:</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/system-of-a-down-toxicity-lyrics-hd7dncz.html\">Toxicity - System of a Down</a></h2><p>This song is really about nature being corrupted and capitalism taking over the world, so all I can really take from it is in relation to the endgame that it&rsquo;s Sansa and her opinion of Dany and how she thinks that she is a conqueror set on taking over Westeros by any means necessary.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/papa-roach-born-for-greatness-lyrics-66ngfhd.html\">Born For Greatness - Papa Roach</a></h2><p>Oh, my heart. I think this is about Varys, whom I&rsquo;ve always loved. He&rsquo;s my fave character in the whole series.</p><blockquote><p>I am a man at war<br />And I am fighting for<br />All of the broken people<br />All of the people thrown overboard<br />They always tried to shame us<br />But they don&rsquo;t speak our language<br />No, we&rsquo;re not nameless, we&rsquo;re not faceless<br />We were born for greatness</p></blockquote><p>Yup, and he fought all the way to the end.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/yeah-yeah-yeahs-gold-lion-lyrics-7s4kw7d.html\">Gold Lion - Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>&nbsp;</h2><p>I could be totally wrong, but all I can think here is Cersei&rsquo;s downfall and her and Jaime&rsquo;s death although he tried to rescue her.</p><blockquote><p>Gold lion&rsquo;s gonna tell me where the light is,<br />Gold lion&rsquo;s gonna tell me where the light is,<br />Take our hands out of control,<br />Take our hands out of control</p><p>Now, tell me what you saw,<br />Tell me what you saw,<br />There was a crowd of seeds,<br />Inside, outside,<br />I must have done a dozen each</p><p>It was the height I threw, the weight,<br />The shell was crushing you,<br />I&rsquo;ve been around a few</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/the-thermals-here-s-your-future-lyrics-8x2jq48.html\">Here&rsquo;s Your Future - The Thermals</a></h2><p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of death and destruction and people are going to pay for their sins, and someone is going to be sacrificed for sins that they did not commit, maybe not in death, but that person won&rsquo;t be happy. And I think that person will be Jon.</p><blockquote><p>God reached his hand down from the sky<br />He flooded the land and he set it afire<br />He said fear me again and know I&rsquo;m your father<br />And remember that no one can breathe underwater</p></blockquote><p>The deaths Dany caused, Theon&rsquo;s death, all the Ironborn deaths, including Euron&rsquo;s mens&rsquo; deaths.</p><blockquote><p>God told his son it&rsquo;s time to come home<br />I promise you won&rsquo;t have to die all alone<br />I need you to pay for the sins I create<br />Son said I will but dad I&rsquo;m afraid</p></blockquote><p>Jon&rsquo;s no Jesus, but he&rsquo;s the closest thing to a sacrificial lamb this show has. He&rsquo;s already died once and risen for the sins of others.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lyricsbox.com/u2-love-is-blindness-lyrics-h7k29dm.html\">Love is Blindness - U2</a></h2><p>Dany and Jon. Period.</p><blockquote><p>Love is blindness<br />I don&rsquo;t want to see<br />Won&rsquo;t you wrap the night<br />Around me<br />Oh my heart<br />Love is blindness</p></blockquote><p>They don&rsquo;t want to know what they know about Jon&rsquo;s parentage. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. It changed everything for them.</p><hr /><p>And that&rsquo;s all she wrote. Agree, disagree&hellip; thoughts? I&rsquo;d really like to know what other people think.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>OK, In early Spring, D.B. Weiss and Daniel Benioff helped create a new Spotify playlist: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXdnZT5DhATDx?si=Fm6C_nfHShCGLFHVluC5qQ\"><i>Game of Thrones</i>: The End Is Coming</a>. Upon doing so, they told For the Record in an email, &ldquo;The answer to the ending is one hundred percent hidden in the playlist choices. No one will believe us, but it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I have spent the last couple of weeks going through each song and trying to figure out which character, which scenario, arc, storyline each song was about. I could be completely way-off, but it was fun. So here you. Enjoy! (Note: All songs link to full lyrics.)</p>\n<p>Fair warning, this is long. Very long. So long that I&rsquo;m going to put a cut. I will say&hellip; yeah, this playlist screams Gendrya endgame.</p>\n</p>",
