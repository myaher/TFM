Peter looked up at Flash\u2019s coach, a first degree he\u2019d never met, and weakly shook his hand with a forced smile.</p><p>Tony was just as reluctant to shake Flash\u2019s hand, and when he did so, he gripped the foam glove firmly and leaned in.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you have against that kid, but you better stop pulling that shit,\u201d Tony whispered darkly. \u201cYou\u2019re a blue tab. You should know by now what\u2019s legal and what isn\u2019t, and if your coach keeps condoning this, you\u2019ll never get anywhere in taekwondo, okay, Cobra Kai?\u201d</p><p>Flash nodded frantically.</p><p>Peter walked back over to Tony, almost immediately collapsing in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYour mouthpiece,\u201d Tony said, holding out his hand. Oh, he knew that the mouthpiece had been in Peter\u2019s mouth the whole time, but he didn\u2019t really care at this point. Peter looked like he was dying. </p><p>Peter, in his tired haze, barely processed what Mr. Stark was saying to him. He was just trying to breathe.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Let me have your mouthpiece.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, gently taking the saliva-covered piece of silicone from the green belt\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Peter whispered, his voice high with panic and raspy from the lack of air. \u201cMr. Stark&hellip; I can\u2019t breathe! Oh, god, it hurts! My stomach&hellip; it hurts so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kicked you in the solar plexus, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Tony said, reaching for Peter\u2019s water bottle. Peter nodded, stepping back and allowing Mr. Stark to give him a drink without Peter having to take his gloves off to grab the bottle. Tony undid the chin strap on Peter\u2019s helmet and removed it, before placing the open water bottle to Peter\u2019s trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna tilt it slowly, okay?\u201d Tony said. Peter nodded, opening his mouth a bit more.</p><p>\u201cOkay, drink up,\u201d Tony said. He angled the bottom up slightly and Peter greedily drank the cold water inside, alternating between taking deep, desperate breaths of air and giant gulps of water.</p><p>\u201cEasy now, don\u2019t spill it,\u201d Tony said. \u201cDrink as much as you can; you need it.\u201d</p><p>Peter ended up finishing off the whole bottle before he was called up for his medal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get enough to drink,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>The division just included Peter and Flash, so the judges handed out only two medals.</p><p>\u201cIn second place, Flash Thompson!\u201d Miss Van Dyne announced. Rhodey stepped forward and put the silver medal around Flash\u2019s neck before shaking his hand.</p><p>\u201cIn first place, Peter Parker!\u201d</p><p>Peter stepped forward, still trying to catch his breath, and allowed Miss Van Dyne herself to put the gold medal around his neck. She gave him a firm handshake and whispered \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><p>The two competitors bowed out and shook the judges\u2019 hands. Some of them congratulated both of them, others offered them advice, and everyone told Flash to stop sweeping people\u2019s legs. Peter walked back over to where his gear was. He could feel blood dripping from his nose. Tony and May rushed to his side.</p><p>Tony let Miss Starr take over his spot as a judge for the rest of the morning, as a second degree she could probably do better than him,  and went to help Peter take his gear off while Aunt May got him more water. When she came back, Peter was then hurried over to the EMTs for his nosebleed.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip; I think my nose is broken,\u201d Peter said. Sure enough, it was, the broken part clearly visible. </p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve gotta do is push it back in,\u201d Dr. Strange said. He reached for Peter\u2019s nose, but Peter, already scared of how much it would hurt, leaned back. Tony grabbed Peter\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony said, rubbing Peter\u2019s back in circles. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over in just a second.\u201d Peter closed his eyes and allowed the red belt black tabs currently wearing scrubs that said EMS on the back of the shirt to get closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna push it back on three,\u201d Strange said. One&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The doctor immediately pushed Peter\u2019s nose back into place, making him yelp in pain. A wadded-up tissue was then placed under his nostrils, and something sticky was placed over the bridge of his nose. He opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re okay,\u201d Strange said. \u201cNo sparring for a while though.\u201d</p><p>Peter and Tony now sat in a corner of the gym with their bags. Tony had elected to keep an eye on him while May picked up lunch for the three of them. Peter was breathing normally, his nosebleed had stopped, and he was drinking plenty more water, but he was still very tense, and, from what Tony could tell, very, very sore. And anxious. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Peter asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been hurt so bad that you felt like crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d Tony said. \u201cSome of it was Iron Man stuff, and some of it was taekwondo stuff.\u201d He looked at Peter with concern. He knew what the kid was getting at. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need to cry, this is the perfect time to do it,\u201d Tony assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitantly scooted over to Tony and leaned against him, letting a few tears fall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just let it out,\u201d Tony said. He wrapped an arm around Peter. </p><p>As if he\u2019d officially been given permission, Peter began to bawl like a baby, gripping the first degree\u2019s dobak and burying his red, sweaty face in the crook of Mr. Stark\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cI was so scared,\u201d Peter whimpered, feeling his mentor pick him up and move him to sit on his lap. Mr. Stark\u2019s strong arms tightened around him and he clung tighter to him, the memory of the sparring match still painfully fresh in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI was scared too,\u201d Tony admitted. \u201cThat kid was brutal. And that shit he was doing was illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kicked me in the back, too,\u201d Peter said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the center ref can only see so much,\u201d Tony said. \u201cEarlier I saw Banner get kicked below the belt when I was a corner judge for his division. The center ref didn\u2019t see it, but honestly I don\u2019t think she could have, from where she was standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kid, Flash, he goes to my high school. He hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the asshole who keeps calling you names? I thought he just liked to beat the shit out of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone. Just me.\u201d Peter sniffled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. But it\u2019s okay now. I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re one determined fighter, Peter.\u201d Tony ruffled the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>They stayed like that until May came back with food. Peter, still shaken up, ate his burger while still leaning against the first degree, occasionally asking questions about what the black belt tournaments were like.</p><p>Tony, of course, answered everything, and, when it was time for him to go up for bracketing, couldn\u2019t bear to tear himself away from the poor kid.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go now, okay, kiddo?\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou go home and get some rest. You\u2019ve had a full day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss the chance to see you compete? No way!\u201d Peter said.</p><p>\u201cSparring is pretty nasty at my level,\u201d Tony warned. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d wanna see me get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get hurt, I\u2019ll be there for you,\u201d Peter said with a smile. \u201cEven black belts need to cry when they\u2019re done sparring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p>",

Peter nodded, opening his mouth a bit more.</p><p>\u201cOkay, drink up,\u201d Tony said. He angled the bottom up slightly and Peter greedily drank the cold water inside, alternating between taking deep, desperate breaths of air and giant gulps of water.</p><p>\u201cEasy now, don\u2019t spill it,\u201d Tony said. \u201cDrink as much as you can; you need it.\u201d</p><p>Peter ended up finishing off the whole bottle before he was called up for his medal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get enough to drink,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>The division just included Peter and Flash, so the judges handed out only two medals.</p><p>\u201cIn second place, Flash Thompson!\u201d Miss Van Dyne announced. Rhodey stepped forward and put the silver medal around Flash\u2019s neck before shaking his hand.</p><p>\u201cIn first place, Peter Parker!\u201d</p><p>Peter stepped forward, still trying to catch his breath, and allowed Miss Van Dyne herself to put the gold medal around his neck. She gave him a firm handshake and whispered \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><p>The two competitors bowed out and shook the judges\u2019 hands. Some of them congratulated both of them, others offered them advice, and everyone told Flash to stop sweeping people\u2019s legs. Peter walked back over to where his gear was. He could feel blood dripping from his nose. Tony and May rushed to his side.</p><p>Tony let Miss Starr take over his spot as a judge for the rest of the morning, as a second degree she could probably do better than him,  and went to help Peter take his gear off while Aunt May got him more water. When she came back, Peter was then hurried over to the EMTs for his nosebleed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I think my nose is broken,\u201d Peter said. Sure enough, it was, the broken part clearly visible. </p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve gotta do is push it back in,\u201d Dr. Strange said. He reached for Peter\u2019s nose, but Peter, already scared of how much it would hurt, leaned back. Tony grabbed Peter\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony said, rubbing Peter\u2019s back in circles. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over in just a second.\u201d Peter closed his eyes and allowed the red belt black tabs currently wearing scrubs that said EMS on the back of the shirt to get closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna push it back on three,\u201d Strange said. One\u2026\u201d</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The doctor immediately pushed Peter\u2019s nose back into place, making him yelp in pain. A wadded-up tissue was then placed under his nostrils, and something sticky was placed over the bridge of his nose. He opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re okay,\u201d Strange said. \u201cNo sparring for a while though.\u201d</p><p>Peter and Tony now sat in a corner of the gym with their bags. Tony had elected to keep an eye on him while May picked up lunch for the three of them. Peter was breathing normally, his nosebleed had stopped, and he was drinking plenty more water, but he was still very tense, and, from what Tony could tell, very, very sore. And anxious. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Peter asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been hurt so bad that you felt like crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d Tony said. \u201cSome of it was Iron Man stuff, and some of it was taekwondo stuff.\u201d He looked at Peter with concern. He knew what the kid was getting at. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need to cry, this is the perfect time to do it,\u201d Tony assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitantly scooted over to Tony and leaned against him, letting a few tears fall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just let it out,\u201d Tony said. He wrapped an arm around Peter. </p><p>As if he\u2019d officially been given permission, Peter began to bawl like a baby, gripping the first degree\u2019s dobak and burying his red, sweaty face in the crook of Mr. Stark\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cI was so scared,\u201d Peter whimpered, feeling his mentor pick him up and move him to sit on his lap. Mr. Stark\u2019s strong arms tightened around him and he clung tighter to him, the memory of the sparring match still painfully fresh in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI was scared too,\u201d Tony admitted. \u201cThat kid was brutal. And that shit he was doing was illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kicked me in the back, too,\u201d Peter said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the center ref can only see so much,\u201d Tony said. \u201cEarlier I saw Banner get kicked below the belt when I was a corner judge for his division. The center ref didn\u2019t see it, but honestly I don\u2019t think she could have, from where she was standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kid, Flash, he goes to my high school. He hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the asshole who keeps calling you names? I thought he just liked to beat the shit out of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone. Just me.\u201d Peter sniffled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. But it\u2019s okay now. I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re one determined fighter, Peter.\u201d Tony ruffled the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>They stayed like that until May came back with food. Peter, still shaken up, ate his burger while still leaning against the first degree, occasionally asking questions about what the black belt tournaments were like.</p><p>Tony, of course, answered everything, and, when it was time for him to go up for bracketing, couldn\u2019t bear to tear himself away from the poor kid.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go now, okay, kiddo?\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou go home and get some rest. You\u2019ve had a full day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss the chance to see you compete? No way!\u201d Peter said.</p><p>\u201cSparring is pretty nasty at my level,\u201d Tony warned. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d wanna see me get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get hurt, I\u2019ll be there for you,\u201d Peter said with a smile. \u201cEven black belts need to cry when they\u2019re done sparring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p></p>",

Also if you tag this as st*rk*r I will rip you in half. </p><p>-</p><p>The match ended.</p><p>&ldquo;Three warnings red fighter, one warning blue! One minus point red, no minus points blue!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter, the blue fighter, looked down the whole time, trying to breathe again. He didn&rsquo;t care if he won or lost, as long as he didn&rsquo;t tie with Flash. Everything hurt, he was certain his nose was bleeding, possibly broken, and he&rsquo;d been kicked and punched everywhere, even hit with some illegal techniques, such as leg sweeps. And even with his superhuman endurance, Flash had run him ragged. He didn&rsquo;t want to have to go toe-to-toe with his bully any longer. </p><p>Peter barely registered Miss Van Dyne grabbing hold of his wrist as the judges stood up. He barely noticed his hand being raised up high. He didn&rsquo;t even realized he&rsquo;d won the match until he heard his aunt cheering loudly at him from the bleachers.</p><p>Peter and Flash reluctantly shook hands before going over to the other&rsquo;s coach. Peter looked up at Flash&rsquo;s coach, a first degree he&rsquo;d never met, and weakly shook his hand with a forced smile.</p><p>Tony was just as reluctant to shake Flash&rsquo;s hand, and when he did so, he gripped the foam glove firmly and leaned in.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I don&rsquo;t know what you have against that kid, but you better stop pulling that shit,&rdquo; Tony whispered darkly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a blue tab. You should know by now what&rsquo;s legal and what isn&rsquo;t, and if your coach keeps condoning this, you&rsquo;ll never get anywhere in taekwondo, okay, Cobra Kai?&rdquo;</p><p>Flash nodded frantically.</p><p>Peter walked back over to Tony, almost immediately collapsing in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Your mouthpiece,&rdquo; Tony said, holding out his hand. Oh, he knew that the mouthpiece had been in Peter&rsquo;s mouth the whole time, but he didn&rsquo;t really care at this point. Peter looked like he was dying. </p><p>Peter, in his tired haze, barely processed what Mr. Stark was saying to him. He was just trying to breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter? Let me have your mouthpiece.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed, gently taking the saliva-covered piece of silicone from the green belt&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe,&rdquo; Peter whispered, his voice high with panic and raspy from the lack of air. &ldquo;Mr. Stark&hellip; I can&rsquo;t breathe! Oh, god, it hurts! My stomach&hellip; it hurts so much!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He kicked you in the solar plexus, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Tony said, reaching for Peter&rsquo;s water bottle. Peter nodded, stepping back and allowing Mr. Stark to give him a drink without Peter having to take his gloves off to grab the bottle. Tony undid the chin strap on Peter&rsquo;s helmet and removed it, before placing the open water bottle to Peter&rsquo;s trembling lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna tilt it slowly, okay?&rdquo; Tony said.
