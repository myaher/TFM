I just wish it was more of a team effort between Arya and Bran. I always thought that the first scene in ep 1 with bran missing every shot and arya hitting the bullseye was foreshadowing something important. Especially since he had a few visions holding a bow and arrow, I always thought that it would come full circle but instead he just sat there.",
        "answer": "<p>Oh yeah same they definitely dropped the ball with Bran lol no doubt about that. I\u2019m really disappointed with his character because honestly I expected him to be the one to stop the Night King in the end and they really just didn\u2019t do anything with his character. My original theory for the Night Kings ending was that Jamie and Bran would tag team the NK. The episode definitely had its issues and plot holes, but I went into this season with very low expectations for everyone especially Arya and to see that episode was amazing. I just have to separate the books and the show because I think the books are going to focus more on fufilling the prophecies and giving Bran a bigger arc. The show obviously needed to wrap up the NK and Brans story quick so they went with this and if I don\u2019t think too hard about I\u2019m happy with the episode overall. </p>",
