        "body": "<p><b>Summary: When Cyrus is assigned to create a modern re-telling of \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d for English class, he decides to produce a movie. His stars, however, may pose some trouble. Will he finish his movie on time?</b><br/></p><p><b>If you\u2019d like to be on the tag list, please let me know here or send me a DM or a message! Or, you can also find my story on AO3 and subscribe!</b></p><p><b>Thank you!</b></p><p><b>(Last time, the chapter didn\u2019t show on the tags so I figured it might have been because of the links. So, I\u2019m trying not to add any in but if you need the other chapters, just go on my tyrus perfect moment tag or DM me!)</b></p><hr><p>Despite his little accident, Cyrus was still ready to continue filming the next day. Time stopped for no one and neither did his deadline. If he was to become a real filmmaker, he couldn\u2019t let something as small as getting hit in the face with a basketball and a bleeding nose stop him. Besides, his dad had taken him to the hospital the day before to make sure his nose wasn\u2019t broken (it wasn\u2019t).</p><p>So, the next day, after filming a short Dance scene at the gym (which Andi had decorated), he gathered his cast and crew and headed off to the park to film one of the most important scenes in his movie.</p><p>(And by cast and crew, he only really meant Buffy, T.J., Andi, and Jonah. The others were done shooting for the day and had gone home.)</p><p>\u201cOkay! In this scene, Logan will do his monologue while watching Quinn from afar,\u201d Cyrus explained to them. \u201cBuffy, you\u2019ll stand at the gazebo and look contemplative. Jonah, your camera will do a wide-shot, with T.J. close and Buffy in the background.\u201d</p><p>Jonah gave him a thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cAndi, will you fix Buffy\u2019s makeup, please? We\u2019re starting in five.\u201d</p><p>The equivalent of the infamous balcony scene, Logan and Quinn agree to meet up. Quinn sneaks away to the gazebo and Logan follows her after. Then, the two do their individual monologues and then their confessions.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Cyrus asked T.J., who was standing on his spot, reading his script.</p><p>He was dressed in a lavender button down, black slacks, matching suit jacket, and a purple tie to match Buffy\u2019s purple cocktail dress.</p><p>The taller boy shrugged. \u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be. You know\u2026 as long as Buffy doesn\u2019t kill me after.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chuckled. \u201cWell, then, you\u2019ll be thrilled that I replaced the kiss with a hug.\u201d</p><p>T.J. scrunched his face, looking disgusted. \u201cShe really would have killed me then!\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head in amusement, Cyrus stepped forward and reached up to take hold of the purple tie.</p><p>\u201cYour tie is all crooked,\u201d he stated, fixing it. Then, he smoothed T.J.\u2019s suit jacket, picking off some stray lint. \u201cThere, all handsome.\u201d He looked up to smile at the other boy.</p><p>T.J. was red as he stared down at him.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened in alarm. \u201cAre you okay?!\u201d</p><p>He placed a hand on the other boy\u2019s forehead, wondering if he had a fever. Was he sick?! Had Cyrus been pushing him too hard?!</p><p>Despite his panicking, T.J. just chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. I think it\u2019s just a little hot out.\u201d</p><p>Well, that made sense. It was a little humid that day. They better wrap up this scene so they could all go home soon. Plus, they all had a pretty long day at school. And it was Friday!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some water, then! Don\u2019t want my star to be dehydrated!\u201d</p><p>And with that, he bounded off to get T.J. a bottle of water. (He was well-prepared with snacks and hydration!)</p><!-- more --><p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>He practiced his monologue all night, in front of his cat. Sure, Simon didn\u2019t give a damn about the words he was saying to him as long as T.J. gave him his dinner, but still, he had felt confident.<br/></p><p>So, when the time came to shoot, T.J. was proud to say that it went flawlessly. Okay, maybe he stumbled once and forgot a few words the second time, but by the third and fourth take, he had perfected it.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Cyrus called out. \u201cThat was great T.J.!\u201d</p><p>His heart swelled with joy at the other boy\u2019s compliment.</p><p>\u201cBuffy! Get ready for your scene!\u201d</p><p>As they moved the cameras closer to Buffy\u2019s spot, T.J. found himself staying by Cyrus\u2019 side. He subtly leaned in and pressed their shoulders together while the other boy adjusted his camera. Cyrus briefly turned his head to smile at him before going back to his task.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Buffy! You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep!\u201d The girl gave them a thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 action!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cLogan\u2026 where are you?\u201d</i> Buffy said out loud as she looked out into the distance. <i>\u201cIs this really okay? Can we be together like this and not hurt our friends?\u201d</i> She sighed, loudly. <i>\u201cDoes it really matter whether you\u2019re in their team or not?\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy\u2019s voice droned on in T.J.\u2019s ears. He knew he should be watching her because everybody else was. But, he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from Cyrus.</p><p>The director\u2019s concentration was firmly on the camera screen, barely breathing as his teeth subtly gnawed at his lower lip. He had really plump lips that stood out whenever he pouted.\u00a0</p><p>Not for the first time, T.J. wondered what it would be like to kiss Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d</p><p>His voice broke through T.J.\u2019s thoughts. Realizing what was just running through his head while staring at Cyrus, he blushed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that was great!\u201d Cyrus called out to Buffy, oblivious to T.J.\u2019s red face. \u201cOne more take! This time, try to act a little more\u2026dreamy! You\u2019re in love, remember? You\u2019re daydreaming about him!\u201d</p><p>T.J. knew all about daydreams.</p><p>Then, Cyrus turned to him. \u201cWe\u2019ll do two more takes and then we\u2019ll do the next scene, if you want to look at your script again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>He was smiling but on the inside, he was groaning. He and Buffy were supposed to hug in this scene after spewing some flowery stuff at each other.</p><p>But, he had to keep remembering that he was doing this for Cyrus. It was all for Cyrus. Just like in all of his other scenes, he just had to pretend that the person in front of him is the person he liked\u2026which was Cyrus.</p><p>So, while Buffy continued to film her scene, T.J. read through his script again, memorizing and feeling the emotions behind those words. And even though the words were cheesier than The Spoon\u2019s mac-and-cheese, they were words written by Cyrus\u2026and he had a way with them that just reeled T.J. in.</p><p>Soon, he found himself standing under the gazebo, Buffy across from him and Cyrus in between them, explaining what he wanted them to do.</p><p>Walk to Buffy. Stand close. Take one of her hands and put it against his heart. Then\u2026 hug.</p><p>\u201cReady? And\u2026 action!\u201d</p><p>T.J. got into character and sauntered over to Buffy. <i>\u201cQuinn,\u201d</i> he called out.</p><p>Buffy spun on her heels and smiled at him. <i>\u201cLogan. I thought you would never come.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course, I would.\u201d</i> T.J. took a few steps forward. <i>\u201cI promised you I would.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre we doing the right thing? Keeping us a secret from our teams? Our friends?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know what will happen if we tell them. They won\u2019t forgive us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know but\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>This was the moment when T.J. was supposed to take Buffy\u2019s hand and put it against his chest. So he reached out to do exactly that.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d</p><p>They both turned to Cyrus, confused. Neither of them made a mistake on their lines.</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re standing too far, T.J.\u201d</p><p>The athlete looked at the distance between him and Buffy. It seemed like a respectable distance. He took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cyrus left his camera to walk up to the both of them. Situating himself in between, the shorter boy gently placed a hand on T.J.\u2019s back and pushed him closer to Buffy, who took a step back. Cyrus took her arm and pulled her back in her original place.</p><p>\u201cLike this,\u201d he stated, matter-of-factly.</p><p>Buffy looked up at T.J., lips in a tight line and hands clenched in fists at her side. He knew that she was holding herself back from punching him in the face and running away.</p><p>\u201cBuffy, why do you look like you want to punch him?\u201d Cyrus asked, looking at her. \u201cYou have to be in love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! But his face\u2026\u201d</p><p>T.J. sneered. \u201cYours is no work of art either, Driscoll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d Cyrus stepped in between them. \u201cThis is supposed to be the perfect moment and you\u2019re ruining it!\u201d</p><p>Buffy raised an eyebrow. \u201cPerfect moment?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. \u201cIn every story, there is a perfect moment. The timing is right, the mood is set, and everything else fades away into the background. It\u2019s the moment that captures the audience and sticks in their memory the most. This is the scene where Logan and Quinn pledge their love for one another and swear not to let anything get in between them. The perfect moment! So, please\u2026 get this right? For me?\u201d</p><p>He was practically pleading at that point and T.J. felt guilty that his lack of romantic chemistry with Buffy was causing problems.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cy, it\u2019s just\u2026 really hard,\u201d Buffy explained, looking sorry. \u201cI mean\u2026 look at him!\u201d</p><p>She gestured at T.J.\u2019s face.</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him. T.J. grinned. And Cyrus blushed and cutely looked away.</p><p>\u201cI see nothing wrong with his face,\u201d he stated.\u00a0\u201cIn fact, he looks quite handsome&hellip; and you\u2019re very pretty!\u201d</p><p>T.J. resisted the urge to blush.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d Cyrus continued. \u201cClose your eyes, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Buffy asked.</p><p>\u201cJust do it, please.\u201d</p><p>Obediently, T.J. shut his eyes. It took a moment but Buffy must have closed hers too as Cyrus cleared his throat and began to talk.</p><p>\u201cNow, imagine that the person in front of you is the person you like.</p><p>T.J. pictured it in his head.</p><p>Cyrus standing in front of him, wearing that cute eye smile as he looked up at T.J. like he was the most amazing person in the world.</p><p>\u201cThe words on the script are the words you want to say to them.\u201d</p><p><i>I\u2019d give it all up for you. The team. My position. Everything if it means I can be with you.</i></p><p>\u201cPicture how they look at you when you do. Are they happy to hear you say those words?\u201d</p><p>No, Cyrus wouldn\u2019t be happy. He knew how important basketball was to T.J. and would never let him give it up. In fact, he would probably be angry if T.J. tried. He would still look cute, though. Like a puppy trying to bark.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about them?\u201d</p><p>T.J. would still give it all up if Cyrus asked him to.</p><p>\u201cNow, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>T.J. obeyed and the first thing he saw was Cyrus looking up at him with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the look I needed,\u201d he said, turning his head away to look at Buffy too, who now looked less tense than she was earlier. \u201cWe\u2019ll resume in five, okay? Take in those feelings just now.\u201d</p><p>He patted them both in the back before walking back to his camera. T.J. watched him go, worried because Cyrus just looked stressed out. He wanted to help him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this right this time, okay?\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice interrupted his thoughts and he turned his head back to look at her.</p><p>The girl no longer looked like she wanted to kill him, which was a relief, honestly. That would make this scene easier to act out when she wasn\u2019t glaring at him. It was just so easy to banter with her. He supposed that that was just what their relationship would always be like.</p><p>\u201cYeah, definitely. We should,\u201d T.J. agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this any more difficult on Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>Buffy flashed him a strange look. \u201cYou know\u2026 you should just hurry up and make a move.\u201d</p><p>That caught him off-guard and he immediately felt the blood rush to his cheeks. \u201cW-What?\u201d was all he could manage. \u201cW-What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted. \u201cOh, please, you\u2019re not exactly subtle. Practically everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>His throat was suddenly dry and he swallowed. \u201cE-Everyone?\u201d</p><p>Buffy shrugged. \u201cEveryone with eyes.\u201d Her eyes softened. \u201cLook, T.J., I may not be\u2026 fond of you.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cBut, me and everyone else can see that you care about Cyrus. And Cyrus cares about you, too. Trust me, I\u2019m his best friend.\u201d</p><p>He almost felt touched at that. But, that didn\u2019t mean she was right\u2026was she? Could Cyrus care about him in the same way? Or maybe it was the kind of care that he felt for all of his friends. Cyrus was a caring person, after all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted again and punched his arm. \u201cAt least try to make a move on him or something!\u201d</p><p>He resisted the urge to rub his arm (damn, this girl could punch!) and, instead, ran a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2026\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut\u2026 what should I do?\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted again. \u201cWell, don\u2019t expect me to help you there.\u201d She smirked. \u201cUnless you beg.\u201d</p><p>T.J. huffed. \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks. I\u2019ll figure it out myself.\u201d He hesitated before asking in a soft voice, \u201cYou think he cares about me?\u201d</p><p>Buffy laughed. \u201cYou\u2026 are\u2026 oblivious,\u201d was all she said before punching his arm again.</p><p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be getting along well now,\u201d said Andi, looking towards the gazebo.</p><p>Cyrus followed her gaze and watched Buffy laughing before punching T.J. in the arm. From Buffy, that was practically a sign of affection.</p><p>Something twitched inside his chest and Cyrus turned away to look at the script again. \u201cT-That\u2019s good,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Cy?\u201d Andi asked, concern in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just seem\u2026 bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he insisted before clearing his throat. \u201cAnyway, we should start soon.\u201d He turned back to the two under the gazebo, ignoring the way his chest twitched again. \u201cGet ready!\u201d</p><p>The two paused their conversation and got in their place. Cyrus positioned himself behind the camera and checked to see if Jonah was ready, too.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Ready\u2026 And\u2026 Action!\u201d</p><p>Up ahead on the gazebo, T.J. began.</p><p><i>\u201cQuinn.\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy turned around smiled. <i>\u201cLogan. I thought you would never come.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course, I would.\u201d </i>T.J. took a few steps towards her. <i>\u201cI promised you I would.\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy looked down at the floor. <i>\u201cAre we doing the right thing? Keeping us a secret from our teams? Our friends?\u201d</i></p><p>T.J. moved a few more steps closer until he was at the spot Cyrus had shown him. <i>\u201cYou know what will happen if we tell them. They won\u2019t forgive us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know but\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>T.J. reached out to take Buffy\u2019s hand.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart was pumping hard and fast against his chest as Buffy raised her head to look at T.J. And, there it was\u2026 the look. The look that Cyrus wanted. The soft, loving look that spoke volumes, even through a camera screen.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019d give it all up,\u201d</i> T.J. said.</p><p>Buffy\u2019s lips parted, slightly, in shock at the declaration.</p><p>Cyrus felt himself swallow as he zoomed in on T.J.\u2019s face.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019d give it all up for you. The team. My position. Everything if it means I can be with you.\u201d</i></p><p>And with those last words\u2026 T.J. leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Buffy, who wrapped her own around his torso.</p><p>Cyrus felt the breath leave his lungs at the sight.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>And, then, T.J. lifted his eyes to look at him. The look brought him back to reality.</p><p>\u201cC-Cut!\u201d he managed to call out.</p><p>The two broke their hug and stepped away from each other.</p><p>\u201cT-That was great!\u201d he called out, with a small smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll do one more take from another angle! Great job, you two!\u201d</p><p>He turned his back to them and slapped his cheeks a little. They felt way too warm. He needed water.</p><p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>After two more takes of the gazebo scene, Cyrus had T.J. and Buffy do a few scenes around the park for a montage.</p><p>They took a walk around the park while holding hands. Sat on the swings while talking (they didn\u2019t have a script for this one but Cyrus wasn\u2019t planning on having any conversation for the montage anyway so the two just talked about basketball). And sat by the pond, watching the ducks.</p><p>It was cute. Adorable. Sweet, even.</p><p>It stressed Cyrus out, for some reason.</p><p>But, after all that was done, they packed up everything and got ready to go home.\u00a0</p><p>It was Friday so they weren\u2019t shooting over the weekend. His project was due next Friday so he had a max of three or four more days to finish shooting everything. Plus, Mr. Spencer had asked him to re-write the last scene and so far, Cyrus hadn\u2019t come up with anything.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d T.J. asked, breaking through his worries.</p><p>The jock was walking him home, still dressed in his formal clothes but with the suit jacket neatly folded in a bag. Both tripod bags hung from his shoulders, as they didn\u2019t want to go back to school to return them so Cyrus was keeping them and the cameras for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just\u2026 worried,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot finishing this movie on time.\u201d Cyrus sighed. \u201cI have to start cutting the clips and editing tonight. In fact, that\u2019s what my weekend will consist of.\u201d He let out a frustrated groan. \u201cThis is harder than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>T.J. gently bumped his shoulders with his. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll finish on time, you never leave anything up to the last minute like I do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his lips twitch into a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can help you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head to meet T.J.\u2019s gaze. \u201cReally? You would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally! I mean, I\u2019ve never edited a video before but if you tell me what to do, I can learn. I wanna help!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus considered it. T.J. had been a big help to him throughout this entire week. And he just couldn\u2019t resist when the taller boy looked so hopeful and excited.</p><p>So, he agreed.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were both on Cyrus\u2019 couch, glasses of lemon water sat on coasters on the coffee table and laptop computers in each of their laps. Cyrus showed him how to scroll through the clips, pick out the best clips, write them down for Cyrus to keep track of later when he edits, and move them to a new folder.</p><p>Side-by-side, with headphones on and barely any space between them, they spent an hour doing exactly this and mostly in silence, the only sounds coming from the clips and the scratching of pencils against paper.</p><p>A few times, Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but peek at T.J. from the corner of his eye. And each time, he felt that same twitching in his chest that he swore to ignore. But, how could he when seeing how seriously the jock was with helping made him feel all warm and fluttery? It wasn\u2019t T.J.\u2019s grade on the line, but he was taking precious time to make sure Cyrus would pass with flying colors.</p><p>T.J. turned his head to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blinked and realized that he had been staring too long this time. \u201cSorry, I spaced out,\u201d he half-lied before removing his headphones. \u201cI\u2019m a bit tired now. Let\u2019s take a break.\u201d</p><p>He moved the computer from his lap to the coffee table and leaned back against the couch, closing his eyes. He felt T.J. moving beside him. Soon, a shoulder pressed against his.</p><p>He opened his eyes and turned his head to T.J. \u201cThank you for everything. Once this is all done, you are definitely getting free milkshakes from me.\u201d</p><p>T.J. grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed and looked away. He knew that T.J. didn\u2019t actually mean a date. But, his heart was weak and he tried to quell the brimming hope threatening to take over.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m having a ton of fun,\u201d T.J. continued, oblivious to Cyrus\u2019 turmoil. \u201cMaybe I can help you with your next video project, too?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 body betrayed him once more and he felt his ears heating up. Nonetheless, he turned to the boy next to him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cReally? I won\u2019t let you back out, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t back out,\u201d T.J. swore, looking serious and determined.</p><p>Cyrus laughed. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a film about two men falling in love?\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still star in it.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>T.J. nodded, eagerly. \u201cIf it means helping you out, Underdog, I\u2019ll play any role.\u201d</p><p>Ahhh, he was so sweet. Cyrus wished his heart would stop beating so fast. It was way too loud and he was afraid T.J. would hear it.</p><p>They continued working on cutting clips throughout the rest of the afternoon until night fell. Cyrus\u2019 parents arrived on time for dinner and they invited T.J., who accepted the invitation. They talked about Cyrus\u2019 project, asked T.J. questions about school, and whatever topic came up.</p><p>After dessert, T.J. announced that it was time for him to leave for home as his curfew was approaching.</p><p>Cyrus walked him out. \u201cThanks, again, T.J.,\u201d he said as they both stood out on the porch.</p><p>The jock grinned. \u201cAny time. If you need me to help you out more this weekend, just let me know. I\u2019m working until 3 tomorrow, but I\u2019m free for the rest of the day and Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a note of that, thank you. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>With one last wink, T.J. turned on his heels and walked away, not realizing that he left Cyrus\u2019 heart doing somersaults. <br/></p><p>Tag list:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS_9gmouPFdTG4Wt24bs2IA\">@lemon-boy-tj</a> <br/><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLM57lFD1V9RM3TXt1oUHMw\">@homosexualearthworm</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ9Xtj2LRN-tG1lISrhVqYw\">@disastrxlogy</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKW3ilDiaHtDao39ovMTetw\">@new-to-the-phandom</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1RqC03phqreKzQWD2y0VMg\">@tyrusgoingfast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSNoE7TqKiTYPy__qlfCxLQ\">@tj-cyrus</a></p><p><b>@multifandom-bxitch</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBg33OPFbYLg4uPdakqhdTg\">@completelysterling</a> completelysterling</p><p>@spike-heels</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtdFCh3mJzEkIBa4STeAL1Q\">@i-am-confussion</a> confussion </b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mipO9W2CKdhXGlHHDG8OGQA\">@buffyshirley</a></p>",

(He was well-prepared with snacks and hydration!)</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>He practiced his monologue all night, in front of his cat. Sure, Simon didn\u2019t give a damn about the words he was saying to him as long as T.J. gave him his dinner, but still, he had felt confident.<br></p><p>So, when the time came to shoot, T.J. was proud to say that it went flawlessly. Okay, maybe he stumbled once and forgot a few words the second time, but by the third and fourth take, he had perfected it.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Cyrus called out. \u201cThat was great T.J.!\u201d</p><p>His heart swelled with joy at the other boy\u2019s compliment.</p><p>\u201cBuffy! Get ready for your scene!\u201d</p><p>As they moved the cameras closer to Buffy\u2019s spot, T.J. found himself staying by Cyrus\u2019 side. He subtly leaned in and pressed their shoulders together while the other boy adjusted his camera. Cyrus briefly turned his head to smile at him before going back to his task.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Buffy! You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep!\u201d The girl gave them a thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 action!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cLogan\u2026 where are you?\u201d</i> Buffy said out loud as she looked out into the distance. <i>\u201cIs this really okay? Can we be together like this and not hurt our friends?\u201d</i> She sighed, loudly. <i>\u201cDoes it really matter whether you\u2019re in their team or not?\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy\u2019s voice droned on in T.J.\u2019s ears. He knew he should be watching her because everybody else was. But, he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from Cyrus.</p><p>The director\u2019s concentration was firmly on the camera screen, barely breathing as his teeth subtly gnawed at his lower lip. He had really plump lips that stood out whenever he pouted.\u00a0</p><p>Not for the first time, T.J. wondered what it would be like to kiss Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d</p><p>His voice broke through T.J.\u2019s thoughts. Realizing what was just running through his head while staring at Cyrus, he blushed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that was great!\u201d Cyrus called out to Buffy, oblivious to T.J.\u2019s red face. \u201cOne more take! This time, try to act a little more\u2026dreamy! You\u2019re in love, remember? You\u2019re daydreaming about him!\u201d</p><p>T.J. knew all about daydreams.</p><p>Then, Cyrus turned to him. \u201cWe\u2019ll do two more takes and then we\u2019ll do the next scene, if you want to look at your script again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>He was smiling but on the inside, he was groaning. He and Buffy were supposed to hug in this scene after spewing some flowery stuff at each other.</p><p>But, he had to keep remembering that he was doing this for Cyrus. It was all for Cyrus. Just like in all of his other scenes, he just had to pretend that the person in front of him is the person he liked\u2026which was Cyrus.</p><p>So, while Buffy continued to film her scene, T.J. read through his script again, memorizing and feeling the emotions behind those words. And even though the words were cheesier than The Spoon\u2019s mac-and-cheese, they were words written by Cyrus\u2026and he had a way with them that just reeled T.J. in.</p><p>Soon, he found himself standing under the gazebo, Buffy across from him and Cyrus in between them, explaining what he wanted them to do.</p><p>Walk to Buffy. Stand close. Take one of her hands and put it against his heart. Then\u2026 hug.</p><p>\u201cReady? And\u2026 action!\u201d</p><p>T.J. got into character and sauntered over to Buffy. <i>\u201cQuinn,\u201d</i> he called out.</p><p>Buffy spun on her heels and smiled at him. <i>\u201cLogan. I thought you would never come.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course, I would.\u201d</i> T.J. took a few steps forward. <i>\u201cI promised you I would.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre we doing the right thing? Keeping us a secret from our teams? Our friends?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know what will happen if we tell them. They won\u2019t forgive us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know but\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>This was the moment when T.J. was supposed to take Buffy\u2019s hand and put it against his chest. So he reached out to do exactly that.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d</p><p>They both turned to Cyrus, confused. Neither of them made a mistake on their lines.</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re standing too far, T.J.\u201d</p><p>The athlete looked at the distance between him and Buffy. It seemed like a respectable distance. He took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cyrus left his camera to walk up to the both of them. Situating himself in between, the shorter boy gently placed a hand on T.J.\u2019s back and pushed him closer to Buffy, who took a step back. Cyrus took her arm and pulled her back in her original place.</p><p>\u201cLike this,\u201d he stated, matter-of-factly.</p><p>Buffy looked up at T.J., lips in a tight line and hands clenched in fists at her side. He knew that she was holding herself back from punching him in the face and running away.</p><p>\u201cBuffy, why do you look like you want to punch him?\u201d Cyrus asked, looking at her. \u201cYou have to be in love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! But his face\u2026\u201d</p><p>T.J. sneered. \u201cYours is no work of art either, Driscoll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d Cyrus stepped in between them. \u201cThis is supposed to be the perfect moment and you\u2019re ruining it!\u201d</p><p>Buffy raised an eyebrow. \u201cPerfect moment?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. \u201cIn every story, there is a perfect moment. The timing is right, the mood is set, and everything else fades away into the background. It\u2019s the moment that captures the audience and sticks in their memory the most. This is the scene where Logan and Quinn pledge their love for one another and swear not to let anything get in between them. The perfect moment! So, please\u2026 get this right? For me?\u201d</p><p>He was practically pleading at that point and T.J. felt guilty that his lack of romantic chemistry with Buffy was causing problems.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cy, it\u2019s just\u2026 really hard,\u201d Buffy explained, looking sorry. \u201cI mean\u2026 look at him!\u201d</p><p>She gestured at T.J.\u2019s face.</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him. T.J. grinned. And Cyrus blushed and cutely looked away.</p><p>\u201cI see nothing wrong with his face,\u201d he stated.\u00a0\u201cIn fact, he looks quite handsome\u2026 and you\u2019re very pretty!\u201d</p><p>T.J. resisted the urge to blush.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d Cyrus continued. \u201cClose your eyes, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Buffy asked.</p><p>\u201cJust do it, please.\u201d</p><p>Obediently, T.J. shut his eyes. It took a moment but Buffy must have closed hers too as Cyrus cleared his throat and began to talk.</p><p>\u201cNow, imagine that the person in front of you is the person you like.</p><p>T.J. pictured it in his head.</p><p>Cyrus standing in front of him, wearing that cute eye smile as he looked up at T.J. like he was the most amazing person in the world.</p><p>\u201cThe words on the script are the words you want to say to them.\u201d</p><p><i>I\u2019d give it all up for you. The team. My position. Everything if it means I can be with you.</i></p><p>\u201cPicture how they look at you when you do. Are they happy to hear you say those words?\u201d</p><p>No, Cyrus wouldn\u2019t be happy. He knew how important basketball was to T.J. and would never let him give it up. In fact, he would probably be angry if T.J. tried. He would still look cute, though. Like a puppy trying to bark.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about them?\u201d</p><p>T.J. would still give it all up if Cyrus asked him to.</p><p>\u201cNow, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>T.J. obeyed and the first thing he saw was Cyrus looking up at him with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the look I needed,\u201d he said, turning his head away to look at Buffy too, who now looked less tense than she was earlier. \u201cWe\u2019ll resume in five, okay? Take in those feelings just now.\u201d</p><p>He patted them both in the back before walking back to his camera. T.J. watched him go, worried because Cyrus just looked stressed out. He wanted to help him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this right this time, okay?\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice interrupted his thoughts and he turned his head back to look at her.</p><p>The girl no longer looked like she wanted to kill him, which was a relief, honestly. That would make this scene easier to act out when she wasn\u2019t glaring at him. It was just so easy to banter with her. He supposed that that was just what their relationship would always be like.</p><p>\u201cYeah, definitely. We should,\u201d T.J. agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this any more difficult on Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>Buffy flashed him a strange look. \u201cYou know\u2026 you should just hurry up and make a move.\u201d</p><p>That caught him off-guard and he immediately felt the blood rush to his cheeks. \u201cW-What?\u201d was all he could manage. \u201cW-What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted. \u201cOh, please, you\u2019re not exactly subtle. Practically everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>His throat was suddenly dry and he swallowed. \u201cE-Everyone?\u201d</p><p>Buffy shrugged. \u201cEveryone with eyes.\u201d Her eyes softened. \u201cLook, T.J., I may not be\u2026 fond of you.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cBut, me and everyone else can see that you care about Cyrus. And Cyrus cares about you, too. Trust me, I\u2019m his best friend.\u201d</p><p>He almost felt touched at that. But, that didn\u2019t mean she was right\u2026was she? Could Cyrus care about him in the same way? Or maybe it was the kind of care that he felt for all of his friends. Cyrus was a caring person, after all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted again and punched his arm. \u201cAt least try to make a move on him or something!\u201d</p><p>He resisted the urge to rub his arm (damn, this girl could punch!) and, instead, ran a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2026\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut\u2026 what should I do?\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted again. \u201cWell, don\u2019t expect me to help you there.\u201d She smirked. \u201cUnless you beg.\u201d</p><p>T.J. huffed. \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks. I\u2019ll figure it out myself.\u201d He hesitated before asking in a soft voice, \u201cYou think he cares about me?\u201d</p><p>Buffy laughed. \u201cYou\u2026 are\u2026 oblivious,\u201d was all she said before punching his arm again.</p><p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be getting along well now,\u201d said Andi, looking towards the gazebo.</p><p>Cyrus followed her gaze and watched Buffy laughing before punching T.J. in the arm. From Buffy, that was practically a sign of affection.</p><p>Something twitched inside his chest and Cyrus turned away to look at the script again. \u201cT-That\u2019s good,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Cy?\u201d Andi asked, concern in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just seem\u2026 bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he insisted before clearing his throat. \u201cAnyway, we should start soon.\u201d He turned back to the two under the gazebo, ignoring the way his chest twitched again. \u201cGet ready!\u201d</p><p>The two paused their conversation and got in their place. Cyrus positioned himself behind the camera and checked to see if Jonah was ready, too.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Ready\u2026 And\u2026 Action!\u201d</p><p>Up ahead on the gazebo, T.J. began.</p><p><i>\u201cQuinn.\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy turned around smiled. <i>\u201cLogan. I thought you would never come.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course, I would.\u201d </i>T.J. took a few steps towards her. <i>\u201cI promised you I would.\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy looked down at the floor. <i>\u201cAre we doing the right thing? Keeping us a secret from our teams? Our friends?\u201d</i></p><p>T.J. moved a few more steps closer until he was at the spot Cyrus had shown him. <i>\u201cYou know what will happen if we tell them. They won\u2019t forgive us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know but\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>T.J. reached out to take Buffy\u2019s hand.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart was pumping hard and fast against his chest as Buffy raised her head to look at T.J. And, there it was\u2026 the look. The look that Cyrus wanted. The soft, loving look that spoke volumes, even through a camera screen.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019d give it all up,\u201d</i> T.J. said.</p><p>Buffy\u2019s lips parted, slightly, in shock at the declaration.</p><p>Cyrus felt himself swallow as he zoomed in on T.J.\u2019s face.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019d give it all up for you. The team. My position. Everything if it means I can be with you.\u201d</i></p><p>And with those last words\u2026 T.J. leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Buffy, who wrapped her own around his torso.</p><p>Cyrus felt the breath leave his lungs at the sight.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>And, then, T.J. lifted his eyes to look at him. The look brought him back to reality.</p><p>\u201cC-Cut!\u201d he managed to call out.</p><p>The two broke their hug and stepped away from each other.</p><p>\u201cT-That was great!\u201d he called out, with a small smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll do one more take from another angle! Great job, you two!\u201d</p><p>He turned his back to them and slapped his cheeks a little. They felt way too warm. He needed water.</p><p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>After two more takes of the gazebo scene, Cyrus had T.J. and Buffy do a few scenes around the park for a montage.</p><p>They took a walk around the park while holding hands. Sat on the swings while talking (they didn\u2019t have a script for this one but Cyrus wasn\u2019t planning on having any conversation for the montage anyway so the two just talked about basketball). And sat by the pond, watching the ducks.</p><p>It was cute. Adorable. Sweet, even.</p><p>It stressed Cyrus out, for some reason.</p><p>But, after all that was done, they packed up everything and got ready to go home.\u00a0</p><p>It was Friday so they weren\u2019t shooting over the weekend. His project was due next Friday so he had a max of three or four more days to finish shooting everything. Plus, Mr. Spencer had asked him to re-write the last scene and so far, Cyrus hadn\u2019t come up with anything.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d T.J. asked, breaking through his worries.</p><p>The jock was walking him home, still dressed in his formal clothes but with the suit jacket neatly folded in a bag. Both tripod bags hung from his shoulders, as they didn\u2019t want to go back to school to return them so Cyrus was keeping them and the cameras for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just\u2026 worried,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot finishing this movie on time.\u201d Cyrus sighed. \u201cI have to start cutting the clips and editing tonight. In fact, that\u2019s what my weekend will consist of.\u201d He let out a frustrated groan. \u201cThis is harder than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>T.J. gently bumped his shoulders with his. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll finish on time, you never leave anything up to the last minute like I do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his lips twitch into a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can help you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head to meet T.J.\u2019s gaze. \u201cReally? You would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally! I mean, I\u2019ve never edited a video before but if you tell me what to do, I can learn. I wanna help!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus considered it. T.J. had been a big help to him throughout this entire week. And he just couldn\u2019t resist when the taller boy looked so hopeful and excited.</p><p>So, he agreed.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were both on Cyrus\u2019 couch, glasses of lemon water sat on coasters on the coffee table and laptop computers in each of their laps. Cyrus showed him how to scroll through the clips, pick out the best clips, write them down for Cyrus to keep track of later when he edits, and move them to a new folder.</p><p>Side-by-side, with headphones on and barely any space between them, they spent an hour doing exactly this and mostly in silence, the only sounds coming from the clips and the scratching of pencils against paper.</p><p>A few times, Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but peek at T.J. from the corner of his eye. And each time, he felt that same twitching in his chest that he swore to ignore. But, how could he when seeing how seriously the jock was with helping made him feel all warm and fluttery? It wasn\u2019t T.J.\u2019s grade on the line, but he was taking precious time to make sure Cyrus would pass with flying colors.</p><p>T.J. turned his head to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blinked and realized that he had been staring too long this time. \u201cSorry, I spaced out,\u201d he half-lied before removing his headphones. \u201cI\u2019m a bit tired now. Let\u2019s take a break.\u201d</p><p>He moved the computer from his lap to the coffee table and leaned back against the couch, closing his eyes. He felt T.J. moving beside him. Soon, a shoulder pressed against his.</p><p>He opened his eyes and turned his head to T.J. \u201cThank you for everything. Once this is all done, you are definitely getting free milkshakes from me.\u201d</p><p>T.J. grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed and looked away. He knew that T.J. didn\u2019t actually mean a date. But, his heart was weak and he tried to quell the brimming hope threatening to take over.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m having a ton of fun,\u201d T.J. continued, oblivious to Cyrus\u2019 turmoil. \u201cMaybe I can help you with your next video project, too?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 body betrayed him once more and he felt his ears heating up. Nonetheless, he turned to the boy next to him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cReally? I won\u2019t let you back out, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t back out,\u201d T.J. swore, looking serious and determined.</p><p>Cyrus laughed. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a film about two men falling in love?\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still star in it.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>T.J. nodded, eagerly. \u201cIf it means helping you out, Underdog, I\u2019ll play any role.\u201d</p><p>Ahhh, he was so sweet. Cyrus wished his heart would stop beating so fast. It was way too loud and he was afraid T.J. would hear it.</p><p>They continued working on cutting clips throughout the rest of the afternoon until night fell. Cyrus\u2019 parents arrived on time for dinner and they invited T.J., who accepted the invitation. They talked about Cyrus\u2019 project, asked T.J. questions about school, and whatever topic came up.</p><p>After dessert, T.J. announced that it was time for him to leave for home as his curfew was approaching.</p><p>Cyrus walked him out. \u201cThanks, again, T.J.,\u201d he said as they both stood out on the porch.</p><p>The jock grinned. \u201cAny time. If you need me to help you out more this weekend, just let me know. I\u2019m working until 3 tomorrow, but I\u2019m free for the rest of the day and Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a note of that, thank you. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>With one last wink, T.J. turned on his heels and walked away, not realizing that he left Cyrus\u2019 heart doing somersaults. <br></p><p>Tag list:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS_9gmouPFdTG4Wt24bs2IA\">@lemon-boy-tj</a> <br><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLM57lFD1V9RM3TXt1oUHMw\">@homosexualearthworm</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ9Xtj2LRN-tG1lISrhVqYw\">@disastrxlogy</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKW3ilDiaHtDao39ovMTetw\">@new-to-the-phandom</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1RqC03phqreKzQWD2y0VMg\">@tyrusgoingfast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSNoE7TqKiTYPy__qlfCxLQ\">@tj-cyrus</a></p><p><b>@multifandom-bxitch</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBg33OPFbYLg4uPdakqhdTg\">@completelysterling</a> completelysterling</p><p>@spike-heels</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtdFCh3mJzEkIBa4STeAL1Q\">@i-am-confussion</a> confussion </b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mipO9W2CKdhXGlHHDG8OGQA\">@buffyshirley</a></p>",

His stars, however, may pose some trouble. Will he finish his movie on time?</b><br></p><p><b>If you\u2019d like to be on the tag list, please let me know here or send me a DM or a message!

So, I\u2019m trying not to add any in but if you need the other chapters, just go on my tyrus perfect moment tag or DM me!)</b></p><hr><p>Despite his little accident, Cyrus was still ready to continue filming the next day. Time stopped for no one and neither did his deadline. If he was to become a real filmmaker, he couldn\u2019t let something as small as getting hit in the face with a basketball and a bleeding nose stop him. Besides, his dad had taken him to the hospital the day before to make sure his nose wasn\u2019t broken (it wasn\u2019t).</p><p>So, the next day, after filming a short Dance scene at the gym (which Andi had decorated), he gathered his cast and crew and headed off to the park to film one of the most important scenes in his movie.</p><p>(And by cast and crew, he only really meant Buffy, T.J., Andi, and Jonah. The others were done shooting for the day and had gone home.)</p><p>\u201cOkay! In this scene, Logan will do his monologue while watching Quinn from afar,\u201d Cyrus explained to them. \u201cBuffy, you\u2019ll stand at the gazebo and look contemplative. Jonah, your camera will do a wide-shot, with T.J. close and Buffy in the background.\u201d</p><p>Jonah gave him a thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cAndi, will you fix Buffy\u2019s makeup, please? We\u2019re starting in five.\u201d</p><p>The equivalent of the infamous balcony scene, Logan and Quinn agree to meet up. Quinn sneaks away to the gazebo and Logan follows her after. Then, the two do their individual monologues and then their confessions.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Cyrus asked T.J., who was standing on his spot, reading his script.</p><p>He was dressed in a lavender button down, black slacks, matching suit jacket, and a purple tie to match Buffy\u2019s purple cocktail dress.</p><p>The taller boy shrugged. \u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be. You know\u2026 as long as Buffy doesn\u2019t kill me after.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chuckled. \u201cWell, then, you\u2019ll be thrilled that I replaced the kiss with a hug.\u201d</p><p>T.J. scrunched his face, looking disgusted. \u201cShe really would have killed me then!\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head in amusement, Cyrus stepped forward and reached up to take hold of the purple tie.</p><p>\u201cYour tie is all crooked,\u201d he stated, fixing it. Then, he smoothed T.J.\u2019s suit jacket, picking off some stray lint. \u201cThere, all handsome.\u201d He looked up to smile at the other boy.</p><p>T.J. was red as he stared down at him.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened in alarm. \u201cAre you okay?!\u201d</p><p>He placed a hand on the other boy\u2019s forehead, wondering if he had a fever. Was he sick?! Had Cyrus been pushing him too hard?!</p><p>Despite his panicking, T.J. just chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. I think it\u2019s just a little hot out.\u201d</p><p>Well, that made sense. It was a little humid that day. They better wrap up this scene so they could all go home soon. Plus, they all had a pretty long day at school. And it was Friday!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some water, then! Don\u2019t want my star to be dehydrated!\u201d</p><p>And with that, he bounded off to get T.J. a bottle of water. (He was well-prepared with snacks and hydration!)</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>He practiced his monologue all night, in front of his cat. Sure, Simon didn\u2019t give a damn about the words he was saying to him as long as T.J. gave him his dinner, but still, he had felt confident.<br></p><p>So, when the time came to shoot, T.J. was proud to say that it went flawlessly. Okay, maybe he stumbled once and forgot a few words the second time, but by the third and fourth take, he had perfected it.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Cyrus called out. \u201cThat was great T.J.!\u201d</p><p>His heart swelled with joy at the other boy\u2019s compliment.</p><p>\u201cBuffy! Get ready for your scene!\u201d</p><p>As they moved the cameras closer to Buffy\u2019s spot, T.J. found himself staying by Cyrus\u2019 side. He subtly leaned in and pressed their shoulders together while the other boy adjusted his camera. Cyrus briefly turned his head to smile at him before going back to his task.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Buffy! You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep!\u201d The girl gave them a thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 action!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cLogan\u2026 where are you?\u201d</i> Buffy said out loud as she looked out into the distance. <i>\u201cIs this really okay? Can we be together like this and not hurt our friends?\u201d</i> She sighed, loudly. <i>\u201cDoes it really matter whether you\u2019re in their team or not?\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy\u2019s voice droned on in T.J.\u2019s ears. He knew he should be watching her because everybody else was. But, he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from Cyrus.</p><p>The director\u2019s concentration was firmly on the camera screen, barely breathing as his teeth subtly gnawed at his lower lip. He had really plump lips that stood out whenever he pouted.\u00a0</p><p>Not for the first time, T.J. wondered what it would be like to kiss Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d</p><p>His voice broke through T.J.\u2019s thoughts. Realizing what was just running through his head while staring at Cyrus, he blushed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that was great!\u201d Cyrus called out to Buffy, oblivious to T.J.\u2019s red face. \u201cOne more take! This time, try to act a little more\u2026dreamy! You\u2019re in love, remember? You\u2019re daydreaming about him!\u201d</p><p>T.J. knew all about daydreams.</p><p>Then, Cyrus turned to him. \u201cWe\u2019ll do two more takes and then we\u2019ll do the next scene, if you want to look at your script again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>He was smiling but on the inside, he was groaning. He and Buffy were supposed to hug in this scene after spewing some flowery stuff at each other.</p><p>But, he had to keep remembering that he was doing this for Cyrus. It was all for Cyrus. Just like in all of his other scenes, he just had to pretend that the person in front of him is the person he liked\u2026which was Cyrus.</p><p>So, while Buffy continued to film her scene, T.J. read through his script again, memorizing and feeling the emotions behind those words. And even though the words were cheesier than The Spoon\u2019s mac-and-cheese, they were words written by Cyrus\u2026and he had a way with them that just reeled T.J. in.</p><p>Soon, he found himself standing under the gazebo, Buffy across from him and Cyrus in between them, explaining what he wanted them to do.</p><p>Walk to Buffy. Stand close. Take one of her hands and put it against his heart. Then\u2026 hug.</p><p>\u201cReady? And\u2026 action!\u201d</p><p>T.J. got into character and sauntered over to Buffy. <i>\u201cQuinn,\u201d</i> he called out.</p><p>Buffy spun on her heels and smiled at him. <i>\u201cLogan. I thought you would never come.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course, I would.\u201d</i> T.J. took a few steps forward. <i>\u201cI promised you I would.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre we doing the right thing? Keeping us a secret from our teams? Our friends?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know what will happen if we tell them. They won\u2019t forgive us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know but\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>This was the moment when T.J. was supposed to take Buffy\u2019s hand and put it against his chest. So he reached out to do exactly that.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d</p><p>They both turned to Cyrus, confused. Neither of them made a mistake on their lines.</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re standing too far, T.J.\u201d</p><p>The athlete looked at the distance between him and Buffy. It seemed like a respectable distance. He took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cyrus left his camera to walk up to the both of them. Situating himself in between, the shorter boy gently placed a hand on T.J.\u2019s back and pushed him closer to Buffy, who took a step back. Cyrus took her arm and pulled her back in her original place.</p><p>\u201cLike this,\u201d he stated, matter-of-factly.</p><p>Buffy looked up at T.J., lips in a tight line and hands clenched in fists at her side. He knew that she was holding herself back from punching him in the face and running away.</p><p>\u201cBuffy, why do you look like you want to punch him?\u201d Cyrus asked, looking at her. \u201cYou have to be in love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! But his face\u2026\u201d</p><p>T.J. sneered. \u201cYours is no work of art either, Driscoll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d Cyrus stepped in between them. \u201cThis is supposed to be the perfect moment and you\u2019re ruining it!\u201d</p><p>Buffy raised an eyebrow. \u201cPerfect moment?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. \u201cIn every story, there is a perfect moment. The timing is right, the mood is set, and everything else fades away into the background. It\u2019s the moment that captures the audience and sticks in their memory the most. This is the scene where Logan and Quinn pledge their love for one another and swear not to let anything get in between them. The perfect moment! So, please\u2026 get this right? For me?\u201d</p><p>He was practically pleading at that point and T.J. felt guilty that his lack of romantic chemistry with Buffy was causing problems.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cy, it\u2019s just\u2026 really hard,\u201d Buffy explained, looking sorry. \u201cI mean\u2026 look at him!\u201d</p><p>She gestured at T.J.\u2019s face.</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him. T.J. grinned. And Cyrus blushed and cutely looked away.</p><p>\u201cI see nothing wrong with his face,\u201d he stated.\u00a0\u201cIn fact, he looks quite handsome\u2026 and you\u2019re very pretty!\u201d</p><p>T.J. resisted the urge to blush.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d Cyrus continued. \u201cClose your eyes, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Buffy asked.</p><p>\u201cJust do it, please.\u201d</p><p>Obediently, T.J. shut his eyes. It took a moment but Buffy must have closed hers too as Cyrus cleared his throat and began to talk.</p><p>\u201cNow, imagine that the person in front of you is the person you like.</p><p>T.J. pictured it in his head.</p><p>Cyrus standing in front of him, wearing that cute eye smile as he looked up at T.J. like he was the most amazing person in the world.</p><p>\u201cThe words on the script are the words you want to say to them.\u201d</p><p><i>I\u2019d give it all up for you. The team. My position. Everything if it means I can be with you.</i></p><p>\u201cPicture how they look at you when you do. Are they happy to hear you say those words?\u201d</p><p>No, Cyrus wouldn\u2019t be happy. He knew how important basketball was to T.J. and would never let him give it up. In fact, he would probably be angry if T.J. tried. He would still look cute, though. Like a puppy trying to bark.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about them?\u201d</p><p>T.J. would still give it all up if Cyrus asked him to.</p><p>\u201cNow, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>T.J. obeyed and the first thing he saw was Cyrus looking up at him with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the look I needed,\u201d he said, turning his head away to look at Buffy too, who now looked less tense than she was earlier. \u201cWe\u2019ll resume in five, okay? Take in those feelings just now.\u201d</p><p>He patted them both in the back before walking back to his camera. T.J. watched him go, worried because Cyrus just looked stressed out. He wanted to help him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this right this time, okay?\u201d Buffy\u2019s voice interrupted his thoughts and he turned his head back to look at her.</p><p>The girl no longer looked like she wanted to kill him, which was a relief, honestly. That would make this scene easier to act out when she wasn\u2019t glaring at him. It was just so easy to banter with her. He supposed that that was just what their relationship would always be like.</p><p>\u201cYeah, definitely. We should,\u201d T.J. agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this any more difficult on Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>Buffy flashed him a strange look. \u201cYou know\u2026 you should just hurry up and make a move.\u201d</p><p>That caught him off-guard and he immediately felt the blood rush to his cheeks. \u201cW-What?\u201d was all he could manage. \u201cW-What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted. \u201cOh, please, you\u2019re not exactly subtle. Practically everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>His throat was suddenly dry and he swallowed. \u201cE-Everyone?\u201d</p><p>Buffy shrugged. \u201cEveryone with eyes.\u201d Her eyes softened. \u201cLook, T.J., I may not be\u2026 fond of you.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cBut, me and everyone else can see that you care about Cyrus. And Cyrus cares about you, too. Trust me, I\u2019m his best friend.\u201d</p><p>He almost felt touched at that. But, that didn\u2019t mean she was right\u2026was she? Could Cyrus care about him in the same way? Or maybe it was the kind of care that he felt for all of his friends. Cyrus was a caring person, after all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted again and punched his arm. \u201cAt least try to make a move on him or something!\u201d</p><p>He resisted the urge to rub his arm (damn, this girl could punch!) and, instead, ran a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2026\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut\u2026 what should I do?\u201d</p><p>Buffy snorted again. \u201cWell, don\u2019t expect me to help you there.\u201d She smirked. \u201cUnless you beg.\u201d</p><p>T.J. huffed. \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks. I\u2019ll figure it out myself.\u201d He hesitated before asking in a soft voice, \u201cYou think he cares about me?\u201d</p><p>Buffy laughed. \u201cYou\u2026 are\u2026 oblivious,\u201d was all she said before punching his arm again.</p><p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be getting along well now,\u201d said Andi, looking towards the gazebo.</p><p>Cyrus followed her gaze and watched Buffy laughing before punching T.J. in the arm. From Buffy, that was practically a sign of affection.</p><p>Something twitched inside his chest and Cyrus turned away to look at the script again. \u201cT-That\u2019s good,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Cy?\u201d Andi asked, concern in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just seem\u2026 bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he insisted before clearing his throat. \u201cAnyway, we should start soon.\u201d He turned back to the two under the gazebo, ignoring the way his chest twitched again. \u201cGet ready!\u201d</p><p>The two paused their conversation and got in their place. Cyrus positioned himself behind the camera and checked to see if Jonah was ready, too.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Ready\u2026 And\u2026 Action!\u201d</p><p>Up ahead on the gazebo, T.J. began.</p><p><i>\u201cQuinn.\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy turned around smiled. <i>\u201cLogan. I thought you would never come.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course, I would.\u201d </i>T.J. took a few steps towards her. <i>\u201cI promised you I would.\u201d</i></p><p>Buffy looked down at the floor. <i>\u201cAre we doing the right thing? Keeping us a secret from our teams? Our friends?\u201d</i></p><p>T.J. moved a few more steps closer until he was at the spot Cyrus had shown him. <i>\u201cYou know what will happen if we tell them. They won\u2019t forgive us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know but\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>T.J. reached out to take Buffy\u2019s hand.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart was pumping hard and fast against his chest as Buffy raised her head to look at T.J. And, there it was\u2026 the look. The look that Cyrus wanted. The soft, loving look that spoke volumes, even through a camera screen.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019d give it all up,\u201d</i> T.J. said.</p><p>Buffy\u2019s lips parted, slightly, in shock at the declaration.</p><p>Cyrus felt himself swallow as he zoomed in on T.J.\u2019s face.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019d give it all up for you. The team. My position. Everything if it means I can be with you.\u201d</i></p><p>And with those last words\u2026 T.J. leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Buffy, who wrapped her own around his torso.</p><p>Cyrus felt the breath leave his lungs at the sight.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>And, then, T.J. lifted his eyes to look at him. The look brought him back to reality.</p><p>\u201cC-Cut!\u201d he managed to call out.</p><p>The two broke their hug and stepped away from each other.</p><p>\u201cT-That was great!\u201d he called out, with a small smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll do one more take from another angle! Great job, you two!\u201d</p><p>He turned his back to them and slapped his cheeks a little. They felt way too warm. He needed water.</p><p>\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026.</p><p>After two more takes of the gazebo scene, Cyrus had T.J. and Buffy do a few scenes around the park for a montage.</p><p>They took a walk around the park while holding hands. Sat on the swings while talking (they didn\u2019t have a script for this one but Cyrus wasn\u2019t planning on having any conversation for the montage anyway so the two just talked about basketball). And sat by the pond, watching the ducks.</p><p>It was cute. Adorable. Sweet, even.</p><p>It stressed Cyrus out, for some reason.</p><p>But, after all that was done, they packed up everything and got ready to go home.\u00a0</p><p>It was Friday so they weren\u2019t shooting over the weekend. His project was due next Friday so he had a max of three or four more days to finish shooting everything. Plus, Mr. Spencer had asked him to re-write the last scene and so far, Cyrus hadn\u2019t come up with anything.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d T.J. asked, breaking through his worries.</p><p>The jock was walking him home, still dressed in his formal clothes but with the suit jacket neatly folded in a bag. Both tripod bags hung from his shoulders, as they didn\u2019t want to go back to school to return them so Cyrus was keeping them and the cameras for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just\u2026 worried,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot finishing this movie on time.\u201d Cyrus sighed. \u201cI have to start cutting the clips and editing tonight. In fact, that\u2019s what my weekend will consist of.\u201d He let out a frustrated groan. \u201cThis is harder than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>T.J. gently bumped his shoulders with his. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll finish on time, you never leave anything up to the last minute like I do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his lips twitch into a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can help you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head to meet T.J.\u2019s gaze. \u201cReally? You would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally! I mean, I\u2019ve never edited a video before but if you tell me what to do, I can learn. I wanna help!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus considered it. T.J. had been a big help to him throughout this entire week. And he just couldn\u2019t resist when the taller boy looked so hopeful and excited.</p><p>So, he agreed.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were both on Cyrus\u2019 couch, glasses of lemon water sat on coasters on the coffee table and laptop computers in each of their laps. Cyrus showed him how to scroll through the clips, pick out the best clips, write them down for Cyrus to keep track of later when he edits, and move them to a new folder.</p><p>Side-by-side, with headphones on and barely any space between them, they spent an hour doing exactly this and mostly in silence, the only sounds coming from the clips and the scratching of pencils against paper.</p><p>A few times, Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but peek at T.J. from the corner of his eye. And each time, he felt that same twitching in his chest that he swore to ignore. But, how could he when seeing how seriously the jock was with helping made him feel all warm and fluttery? It wasn\u2019t T.J.\u2019s grade on the line, but he was taking precious time to make sure Cyrus would pass with flying colors.</p><p>T.J. turned his head to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blinked and realized that he had been staring too long this time. \u201cSorry, I spaced out,\u201d he half-lied before removing his headphones. \u201cI\u2019m a bit tired now. Let\u2019s take a break.\u201d</p><p>He moved the computer from his lap to the coffee table and leaned back against the couch, closing his eyes. He felt T.J. moving beside him. Soon, a shoulder pressed against his.</p><p>He opened his eyes and turned his head to T.J. \u201cThank you for everything. Once this is all done, you are definitely getting free milkshakes from me.\u201d</p><p>T.J. grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed and looked away. He knew that T.J. didn\u2019t actually mean a date. But, his heart was weak and he tried to quell the brimming hope threatening to take over.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m having a ton of fun,\u201d T.J. continued, oblivious to Cyrus\u2019 turmoil. \u201cMaybe I can help you with your next video project, too?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 body betrayed him once more and he felt his ears heating up. Nonetheless, he turned to the boy next to him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cReally? I won\u2019t let you back out, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t back out,\u201d T.J. swore, looking serious and determined.</p><p>Cyrus laughed. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a film about two men falling in love?\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still star in it.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>T.J. nodded, eagerly. \u201cIf it means helping you out, Underdog, I\u2019ll play any role.\u201d</p><p>Ahhh, he was so sweet. Cyrus wished his heart would stop beating so fast. It was way too loud and he was afraid T.J. would hear it.</p><p>They continued working on cutting clips throughout the rest of the afternoon until night fell. Cyrus\u2019 parents arrived on time for dinner and they invited T.J., who accepted the invitation. They talked about Cyrus\u2019 project, asked T.J. questions about school, and whatever topic came up.</p><p>After dessert, T.J. announced that it was time for him to leave for home as his curfew was approaching.</p><p>Cyrus walked him out. \u201cThanks, again, T.J.,\u201d he said as they both stood out on the porch.</p><p>The jock grinned. \u201cAny time. If you need me to help you out more this weekend, just let me know. I\u2019m working until 3 tomorrow, but I\u2019m free for the rest of the day and Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a note of that, thank you. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>With one last wink, T.J. turned on his heels and walked away, not realizing that he left Cyrus\u2019 heart doing somersaults. <br></p><p>Tag list:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS_9gmouPFdTG4Wt24bs2IA\">@lemon-boy-tj</a> <br><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLM57lFD1V9RM3TXt1oUHMw\">@homosexualearthworm</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ9Xtj2LRN-tG1lISrhVqYw\">@disastrxlogy</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKW3ilDiaHtDao39ovMTetw\">@new-to-the-phandom</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1RqC03phqreKzQWD2y0VMg\">@tyrusgoingfast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSNoE7TqKiTYPy__qlfCxLQ\">@tj-cyrus</a></p><p><b>@multifandom-bxitch</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBg33OPFbYLg4uPdakqhdTg\">@completelysterling</a> completelysterling</p><p>@spike-heels</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtdFCh3mJzEkIBa4STeAL1Q\">@i-am-confussion</a> confussion </b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mipO9W2CKdhXGlHHDG8OGQA\">@buffyshirley</a></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary: When Cyrus is assigned to create a modern re-telling of &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; for English class, he decides to produce a movie. His stars, however, may pose some trouble. Will he finish his movie on time?</b><br /></p><p><b>If you&rsquo;d like to be on the tag list, please let me know here or send me a DM or a message! Or, you can also find my story on AO3 and subscribe!</b></p><p><b>Thank you!</b></p><p><b>(Last time, the chapter didn&rsquo;t show on the tags so I figured it might have been because of the links. So, I&rsquo;m trying not to add any in but if you need the other chapters, just go on my tyrus perfect moment tag or DM me!)</b></p><hr /><p>Despite his little accident, Cyrus was still ready to continue filming the next day. Time stopped for no one and neither did his deadline. If he was to become a real filmmaker, he couldn&rsquo;t let something as small as getting hit in the face with a basketball and a bleeding nose stop him. Besides, his dad had taken him to the hospital the day before to make sure his nose wasn&rsquo;t broken (it wasn&rsquo;t).</p><p>So, the next day, after filming a short Dance scene at the gym (which Andi had decorated), he gathered his cast and crew and headed off to the park to film one of the most important scenes in his movie.</p><p>(And by cast and crew, he only really meant Buffy, T.J., Andi, and Jonah. The others were done shooting for the day and had gone home.)</p><p>&ldquo;Okay! In this scene, Logan will do his monologue while watching Quinn from afar,&rdquo; Cyrus explained to them. &ldquo;Buffy, you&rsquo;ll stand at the gazebo and look contemplative. Jonah, your camera will do a wide-shot, with T.J. close and Buffy in the background.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah gave him a thumbs up.</p><p>&ldquo;Andi, will you fix Buffy&rsquo;s makeup, please? We&rsquo;re starting in five.&rdquo;</p><p>The equivalent of the infamous balcony scene, Logan and Quinn agree to meet up. Quinn sneaks away to the gazebo and Logan follows her after. Then, the two do their individual monologues and then their confessions.</p><p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; Cyrus asked T.J., who was standing on his spot, reading his script.</p><p>He was dressed in a lavender button down, black slacks, matching suit jacket, and a purple tie to match Buffy&rsquo;s purple cocktail dress.</p><p>The taller boy shrugged. &ldquo;As ready as I&rsquo;ll ever be. You know&hellip; as long as Buffy doesn&rsquo;t kill me after.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus chuckled. &ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;ll be thrilled that I replaced the kiss with a hug.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. scrunched his face, looking disgusted. &ldquo;She really would have killed me then!&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking his head in amusement, Cyrus stepped forward and reached up to take hold of the purple tie.</p><p>&ldquo;Your tie is all crooked,&rdquo; he stated, fixing it. Then, he smoothed T.J.&rsquo;s suit jacket, picking off some stray lint. &ldquo;There, all handsome.&rdquo; He looked up to smile at the other boy.</p><p>T.J. was red as he stared down at him.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; eyes widened in alarm. &ldquo;Are you okay?!&rdquo;</p><p>He placed a hand on the other boy&rsquo;s forehead, wondering if he had a fever. Was he sick?! Had Cyrus been pushing him too hard?!</p><p>Despite his panicking, T.J. just chuckled and shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Really. I think it&rsquo;s just a little hot out.&rdquo;</p><p>Well, that made sense. It was a little humid that day. They better wrap up this scene so they could all go home soon. Plus, they all had a pretty long day at school. And it was Friday!</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you some water, then! Don&rsquo;t want my star to be dehydrated!&rdquo;</p><p>And with that, he bounded off to get T.J. a bottle of water. (He was well-prepared with snacks and hydration!)</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;.&hellip;&hellip;.&hellip;&hellip;.</p><p>He practiced his monologue all night, in front of his cat. Sure, Simon didn&rsquo;t give a damn about the words he was saying to him as long as T.J. gave him his dinner, but still, he had felt confident.<br /></p><p>So, when the time came to shoot, T.J. was proud to say that it went flawlessly. Okay, maybe he stumbled once and forgot a few words the second time, but by the third and fourth take, he had perfected it.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut!&rdquo; Cyrus called out. &ldquo;That was great T.J.!&rdquo;</p><p>His heart swelled with joy at the other boy&rsquo;s compliment.</p><p>&ldquo;Buffy! Get ready for your scene!&rdquo;</p><p>As they moved the cameras closer to Buffy&rsquo;s spot, T.J. found himself staying by Cyrus&rsquo; side. He subtly leaned in and pressed their shoulders together while the other boy adjusted his camera. Cyrus briefly turned his head to smile at him before going back to his task.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Buffy! You ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; The girl gave them a thumbs up.</p><p>&ldquo;And&hellip; action!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Logan&hellip; where are you?&rdquo;</i> Buffy said out loud as she looked out into the distance. <i>&ldquo;Is this really okay? Can we be together like this and not hurt our friends?&rdquo;</i> She sighed, loudly. <i>&ldquo;Does it really matter whether you&rsquo;re in their team or not?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Buffy&rsquo;s voice droned on in T.J.&rsquo;s ears. He knew he should be watching her because everybody else was. But, he couldn&rsquo;t tear his eyes away from Cyrus.</p><p>The director&rsquo;s concentration was firmly on the camera screen, barely breathing as his teeth subtly gnawed at his lower lip. He had really plump lips that stood out whenever he pouted.&nbsp;</p><p>Not for the first time, T.J. wondered what it would be like to kiss Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut!&rdquo;</p><p>His voice broke through T.J.&rsquo;s thoughts. Realizing what was just running through his head while staring at Cyrus, he blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, that was great!&rdquo; Cyrus called out to Buffy, oblivious to T.J.&rsquo;s red face. &ldquo;One more take! This time, try to act a little more&hellip;dreamy! You&rsquo;re in love, remember? You&rsquo;re daydreaming about him!&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. knew all about daydreams.</p><p>Then, Cyrus turned to him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do two more takes and then we&rsquo;ll do the next scene, if you want to look at your script again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;</p><p>He was smiling but on the inside, he was groaning. He and Buffy were supposed to hug in this scene after spewing some flowery stuff at each other.</p><p>But, he had to keep remembering that he was doing this for Cyrus. It was all for Cyrus. Just like in all of his other scenes, he just had to pretend that the person in front of him is the person he liked&hellip;which was Cyrus.</p><p>So, while Buffy continued to film her scene, T.J. read through his script again, memorizing and feeling the emotions behind those words. And even though the words were cheesier than The Spoon&rsquo;s mac-and-cheese, they were words written by Cyrus&hellip;and he had a way with them that just reeled T.J. in.</p><p>Soon, he found himself standing under the gazebo, Buffy across from him and Cyrus in between them, explaining what he wanted them to do.</p><p>Walk to Buffy. Stand close. Take one of her hands and put it against his heart. Then&hellip; hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready? And&hellip; action!&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. got into character and sauntered over to Buffy. <i>&ldquo;Quinn,&rdquo;</i> he called out.</p><p>Buffy spun on her heels and smiled at him. <i>&ldquo;Logan. I thought you would never come.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course, I would.&rdquo;</i> T.J. took a few steps forward. <i>&ldquo;I promised you I would.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are we doing the right thing? Keeping us a secret from our teams? Our friends?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You know what will happen if we tell them. They won&rsquo;t forgive us.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know but&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>This was the moment when T.J. was supposed to take Buffy&rsquo;s hand and put it against his chest. So he reached out to do exactly that.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut!&rdquo;</p><p>They both turned to Cyrus, confused. Neither of them made a mistake on their lines.</p><p>Cyrus sighed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing too far, T.J.&rdquo;</p><p>The athlete looked at the distance between him and Buffy. It seemed like a respectable distance. He took a step forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Like this?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Cyrus left his camera to walk up to the both of them. Situating himself in between, the shorter boy gently placed a hand on T.J.&rsquo;s back and pushed him closer to Buffy, who took a step back. Cyrus took her arm and pulled her back in her original place.</p><p>&ldquo;Like this,&rdquo; he stated, matter-of-factly.</p><p>Buffy looked up at T.J., lips in a tight line and hands clenched in fists at her side. He knew that she was holding herself back from punching him in the face and running away.</p><p>&ldquo;Buffy, why do you look like you want to punch him?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, looking at her. &ldquo;You have to be in love!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! But his face&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. sneered. &ldquo;Yours is no work of art either, Driscoll.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why you-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guys!&rdquo; Cyrus stepped in between them. &ldquo;This is supposed to be the perfect moment and you&rsquo;re ruining it!&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Perfect moment?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. &ldquo;In every story, there is a perfect moment. The timing is right, the mood is set, and everything else fades away into the background. It&rsquo;s the moment that captures the audience and sticks in their memory the most. This is the scene where Logan and Quinn pledge their love for one another and swear not to let anything get in between them. The perfect moment! So, please&hellip; get this right? For me?&rdquo;</p><p>He was practically pleading at that point and T.J. felt guilty that his lack of romantic chemistry with Buffy was causing problems.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Cy, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; really hard,&rdquo; Buffy explained, looking sorry. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; look at him!&rdquo;</p><p>She gestured at T.J.&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him. T.J. grinned. And Cyrus blushed and cutely looked away.</p><p>&ldquo;I see nothing wrong with his face,&rdquo; he stated.&nbsp;&ldquo;In fact, he looks quite handsome&hellip; and you&rsquo;re very pretty!&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. resisted the urge to blush.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How about this?&rdquo; Cyrus continued. &ldquo;Close your eyes, both of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Buffy asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Just do it, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Obediently, T.J. shut his eyes. It took a moment but Buffy must have closed hers too as Cyrus cleared his throat and began to talk.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, imagine that the person in front of you is the person you like.</p><p>T.J. pictured it in his head.</p><p>Cyrus standing in front of him, wearing that cute eye smile as he looked up at T.J. like he was the most amazing person in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;The words on the script are the words you want to say to them.&rdquo;</p><p><i>I&rsquo;d give it all up for you. The team. My position. Everything if it means I can be with you.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Picture how they look at you when you do. Are they happy to hear you say those words?&rdquo;</p><p>No, Cyrus wouldn&rsquo;t be happy. He knew how important basketball was to T.J. and would never let him give it up. In fact, he would probably be angry if T.J. tried. He would still look cute, though. Like a puppy trying to bark.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel about them?&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. would still give it all up if Cyrus asked him to.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, open your eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. obeyed and the first thing he saw was Cyrus looking up at him with a soft smile.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the look I needed,&rdquo; he said, turning his head away to look at Buffy too, who now looked less tense than she was earlier. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll resume in five, okay? Take in those feelings just now.&rdquo;</p><p>He patted them both in the back before walking back to his camera. T.J. watched him go, worried because Cyrus just looked stressed out. He wanted to help him.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this right this time, okay?&rdquo; Buffy&rsquo;s voice interrupted his thoughts and he turned his head back to look at her.</p><p>The girl no longer looked like she wanted to kill him, which was a relief, honestly. That would make this scene easier to act out when she wasn&rsquo;t glaring at him. It was just so easy to banter with her. He supposed that that was just what their relationship would always be like.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, definitely. We should,&rdquo; T.J. agreed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make this any more difficult on Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy flashed him a strange look. &ldquo;You know&hellip; you should just hurry up and make a move.&rdquo;</p><p>That caught him off-guard and he immediately felt the blood rush to his cheeks. &ldquo;W-What?&rdquo; was all he could manage. &ldquo;W-What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy snorted. &ldquo;Oh, please, you&rsquo;re not exactly subtle. Practically everyone knows.&rdquo;</p><p>His throat was suddenly dry and he swallowed. &ldquo;E-Everyone?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy shrugged. &ldquo;Everyone with eyes.&rdquo; Her eyes softened. &ldquo;Look, T.J., I may not be&hellip; fond of you.&rdquo; She wrinkled her nose. &ldquo;But, me and everyone else can see that you care about Cyrus. And Cyrus cares about you, too. Trust me, I&rsquo;m his best friend.&rdquo;</p><p>He almost felt touched at that. But, that didn&rsquo;t mean she was right&hellip;was she? Could Cyrus care about him in the same way? Or maybe it was the kind of care that he felt for all of his friends. Cyrus was a caring person, after all.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy snorted again and punched his arm. &ldquo;At least try to make a move on him or something!&rdquo;</p><p>He resisted the urge to rub his arm (damn, this girl could punch!) and, instead, ran a hand through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I should&hellip;&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But&hellip; what should I do?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy snorted again. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t expect me to help you there.&rdquo; She smirked. &ldquo;Unless you beg.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. huffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, thanks. I&rsquo;ll figure it out myself.&rdquo; He hesitated before asking in a soft voice, &ldquo;You think he cares about me?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy laughed. &ldquo;You&hellip; are&hellip; oblivious,&rdquo; was all she said before punching his arm again.</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;.&hellip;&hellip;.&hellip;&hellip;.</p><p>&ldquo;They seem to be getting along well now,&rdquo; said Andi, looking towards the gazebo.</p><p>Cyrus followed her gaze and watched Buffy laughing before punching T.J. in the arm. From Buffy, that was practically a sign of affection.</p><p>Something twitched inside his chest and Cyrus turned away to look at the script again. &ldquo;T-That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay, Cy?&rdquo; Andi asked, concern in her voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, why wouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You just seem&hellip; bothered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; he insisted before clearing his throat. &ldquo;Anyway, we should start soon.&rdquo; He turned back to the two under the gazebo, ignoring the way his chest twitched again. &ldquo;Get ready!&rdquo;</p><p>The two paused their conversation and got in their place. Cyrus positioned himself behind the camera and checked to see if Jonah was ready, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip; Ready&hellip; And&hellip; Action!&rdquo;</p><p>Up ahead on the gazebo, T.J. began.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Quinn.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Buffy turned around smiled. <i>&ldquo;Logan. I thought you would never come.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course, I would.&rdquo; </i>T.J. took a few steps towards her. <i>&ldquo;I promised you I would.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Buffy looked down at the floor. <i>&ldquo;Are we doing the right thing? Keeping us a secret from our teams? Our friends?&rdquo;</i></p><p>T.J. moved a few more steps closer until he was at the spot Cyrus had shown him. <i>&ldquo;You know what will happen if we tell them. They won&rsquo;t forgive us.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know but&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>T.J. reached out to take Buffy&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; heart was pumping hard and fast against his chest as Buffy raised her head to look at T.J. And, there it was&hellip; the look. The look that Cyrus wanted. The soft, loving look that spoke volumes, even through a camera screen.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give it all up,&rdquo;</i> T.J. said.</p><p>Buffy&rsquo;s lips parted, slightly, in shock at the declaration.</p><p>Cyrus felt himself swallow as he zoomed in on T.J.&rsquo;s face.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give it all up for you. The team. My position. Everything if it means I can be with you.&rdquo;</i></p><p>And with those last words&hellip; T.J. leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Buffy, who wrapped her own around his torso.</p><p>Cyrus felt the breath leave his lungs at the sight.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>And, then, T.J. lifted his eyes to look at him. The look brought him back to reality.</p><p>&ldquo;C-Cut!&rdquo; he managed to call out.</p><p>The two broke their hug and stepped away from each other.</p><p>&ldquo;T-That was great!&rdquo; he called out, with a small smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do one more take from another angle! Great job, you two!&rdquo;</p><p>He turned his back to them and slapped his cheeks a little. They felt way too warm. He needed water.</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;.&hellip;&hellip;.&hellip;&hellip;.</p><p>After two more takes of the gazebo scene, Cyrus had T.J. and Buffy do a few scenes around the park for a montage.</p><p>They took a walk around the park while holding hands. Sat on the swings while talking (they didn&rsquo;t have a script for this one but Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t planning on having any conversation for the montage anyway so the two just talked about basketball). And sat by the pond, watching the ducks.</p><p>It was cute. Adorable. Sweet, even.</p><p>It stressed Cyrus out, for some reason.</p><p>But, after all that was done, they packed up everything and got ready to go home.&nbsp;</p><p>It was Friday so they weren&rsquo;t shooting over the weekend. His project was due next Friday so he had a max of three or four more days to finish shooting everything. Plus, Mr. Spencer had asked him to re-write the last scene and so far, Cyrus hadn&rsquo;t come up with anything.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; T.J. asked, breaking through his worries.</p><p>The jock was walking him home, still dressed in his formal clothes but with the suit jacket neatly folded in a bag. Both tripod bags hung from his shoulders, as they didn&rsquo;t want to go back to school to return them so Cyrus was keeping them and the cameras for the weekend.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just&hellip; worried,&rdquo; he confessed.</p><p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not finishing this movie on time.&rdquo; Cyrus sighed. &ldquo;I have to start cutting the clips and editing tonight. In fact, that&rsquo;s what my weekend will consist of.&rdquo; He let out a frustrated groan. &ldquo;This is harder than I thought it would be.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. gently bumped his shoulders with his. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll finish on time, you never leave anything up to the last minute like I do.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus felt his lips twitch into a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;And I can help you, if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his head to meet T.J.&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Really? You would?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, totally! I mean, I&rsquo;ve never edited a video before but if you tell me what to do, I can learn. I wanna help!&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus considered it. T.J. had been a big help to him throughout this entire week. And he just couldn&rsquo;t resist when the taller boy looked so hopeful and excited.</p><p>So, he agreed.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were both on Cyrus&rsquo; couch, glasses of lemon water sat on coasters on the coffee table and laptop computers in each of their laps. Cyrus showed him how to scroll through the clips, pick out the best clips, write them down for Cyrus to keep track of later when he edits, and move them to a new folder.</p><p>Side-by-side, with headphones on and barely any space between them, they spent an hour doing exactly this and mostly in silence, the only sounds coming from the clips and the scratching of pencils against paper.</p><p>A few times, Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t help but peek at T.J. from the corner of his eye. And each time, he felt that same twitching in his chest that he swore to ignore. But, how could he when seeing how seriously the jock was with helping made him feel all warm and fluttery? It wasn&rsquo;t T.J.&rsquo;s grade on the line, but he was taking precious time to make sure Cyrus would pass with flying colors.</p><p>T.J. turned his head to look at him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus blinked and realized that he had been staring too long this time. &ldquo;Sorry, I spaced out,&rdquo; he half-lied before removing his headphones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit tired now. Let&rsquo;s take a break.&rdquo;</p><p>He moved the computer from his lap to the coffee table and leaned back against the couch, closing his eyes. He felt T.J. moving beside him. Soon, a shoulder pressed against his.</p><p>He opened his eyes and turned his head to T.J. &ldquo;Thank you for everything. Once this is all done, you are definitely getting free milkshakes from me.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus blushed and looked away. He knew that T.J. didn&rsquo;t actually mean a date. But, his heart was weak and he tried to quell the brimming hope threatening to take over.</p><p>&ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;m having a ton of fun,&rdquo; T.J. continued, oblivious to Cyrus&rsquo; turmoil. &ldquo;Maybe I can help you with your next video project, too?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; body betrayed him once more and he felt his ears heating up. Nonetheless, he turned to the boy next to him and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? I won&rsquo;t let you back out, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t back out,&rdquo; T.J. swore, looking serious and determined.</p><p>Cyrus laughed. &ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s a film about two men falling in love?&rdquo; he joked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d still star in it.&rdquo;</p><p>He blinked, surprised. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. nodded, eagerly. &ldquo;If it means helping you out, Underdog, I&rsquo;ll play any role.&rdquo;</p><p>Ahhh, he was so sweet. Cyrus wished his heart would stop beating so fast. It was way too loud and he was afraid T.J. would hear it.</p><p>They continued working on cutting clips throughout the rest of the afternoon until night fell. Cyrus&rsquo; parents arrived on time for dinner and they invited T.J., who accepted the invitation. They talked about Cyrus&rsquo; project, asked T.J. questions about school, and whatever topic came up.</p><p>After dessert, T.J. announced that it was time for him to leave for home as his curfew was approaching.</p><p>Cyrus walked him out. &ldquo;Thanks, again, T.J.,&rdquo; he said as they both stood out on the porch.</p><p>The jock grinned. &ldquo;Any time. If you need me to help you out more this weekend, just let me know. I&rsquo;m working until 3 tomorrow, but I&rsquo;m free for the rest of the day and Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a note of that, thank you. Good night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p><p>With one last wink, T.J. turned on his heels and walked away, not realizing that he left Cyrus&rsquo; heart doing somersaults. <br /></p><p>Tag list:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS_9gmouPFdTG4Wt24bs2IA\">@lemon-boy-tj</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLM57lFD1V9RM3TXt1oUHMw\">@homosexualearthworm</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ9Xtj2LRN-tG1lISrhVqYw\">@disastrxlogy</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKW3ilDiaHtDao39ovMTetw\">@new-to-the-phandom</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1RqC03phqreKzQWD2y0VMg\">@tyrusgoingfast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSNoE7TqKiTYPy__qlfCxLQ\">@tj-cyrus</a></p><p><b>@multifandom-bxitch</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBg33OPFbYLg4uPdakqhdTg\">@completelysterling</a> completelysterling</p><p>@spike-heels</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtdFCh3mJzEkIBa4STeAL1Q\">@i-am-confussion</a> confussion </b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mipO9W2CKdhXGlHHDG8OGQA\">@buffyshirley</a></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Summary: When Cyrus is assigned to create a modern re-telling of &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; for English class, he decides to produce a movie. His stars, however, may pose some trouble. Will he finish his movie on time?</b><br /></p>\n<p><b>If you&rsquo;d like to be on the tag list, please let me know here or send me a DM or a message!

So, I&rsquo;m trying not to add any in but if you need the other chapters, just go on my tyrus perfect moment tag or DM me!)</b></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Despite his little accident, Cyrus was still ready to continue filming the next day. Time stopped for no one and neither did his deadline. If he was to become a real filmmaker, he couldn&rsquo;t let something as small as getting hit in the face with a basketball and a bleeding nose stop him. Besides, his dad had taken him to the hospital the day before to make sure his nose wasn&rsquo;t broken (it wasn&rsquo;t).</p>\n<p>So, the next day, after filming a short Dance scene at the gym (which Andi had decorated), he gathered his cast and crew and headed off to the park to film one of the most important scenes in his movie.</p>\n<p>(And by cast and crew, he only really meant Buffy, T.J., Andi, and Jonah. The others were done shooting for the day and had gone home.)</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Okay! In this scene, Logan will do his monologue while watching Quinn from afar,&rdquo; Cyrus explained to them. &ldquo;Buffy, you&rsquo;ll stand at the gazebo and look contemplative. Jonah, your camera will do a wide-shot, with T.J. close and Buffy in the background.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jonah gave him a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Andi, will you fix Buffy&rsquo;s makeup, please? We&rsquo;re starting in five.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The equivalent of the infamous balcony scene, Logan and Quinn agree to meet up. Quinn sneaks away to the gazebo and Logan follows her after. Then, the two do their individual monologues and then their confessions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; Cyrus asked T.J., who was standing on his spot, reading his script.</p>\n<p>He was dressed in a lavender button down, black slacks, matching suit jacket, and a purple tie to match Buffy&rsquo;s purple cocktail dress.</p>\n<p>The taller boy shrugged. &ldquo;As ready as I&rsquo;ll ever be. You know&hellip; as long as Buffy doesn&rsquo;t kill me after.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus chuckled. &ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;ll be thrilled that I replaced the kiss with a hug.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>T.J. scrunched his face, looking disgusted. &ldquo;She really would have killed me then!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shaking his head in amusement, Cyrus stepped forward and reached up to take hold of the purple tie.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your tie is all crooked,&rdquo; he stated, fixing it. Then, he smoothed T.J.&rsquo;s suit jacket, picking off some stray lint. &ldquo;There, all handsome.&rdquo; He looked up to smile at the other boy.</p>\n<p>T.J. was red as he stared down at him.</p>\n<p>Cyrus&rsquo; eyes widened in alarm. &ldquo;Are you okay?!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He placed a hand on the other boy&rsquo;s forehead, wondering if he had a fever. Was he sick?! Had Cyrus been pushing him too hard?!</p>\n<p>Despite his panicking, T.J. just chuckled and shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Really. I think it&rsquo;s just a little hot out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Well, that made sense. It was a little humid that day. They better wrap up this scene so they could all go home soon. Plus, they all had a pretty long day at school. And it was Friday!</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you some water, then! Don&rsquo;t want my star to be dehydrated!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And with that, he bounded off to get T.J. a bottle of water. (He was well-prepared with snacks and hydration!)</p>\n</p>",
