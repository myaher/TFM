        "body": "<p>\u201cJiminnn! My sweet angel!!\u201d<br/>You yelled throwing yourself on your friend hugging him tight. The blond haired man hugged you back tightly, nuzzling his nose in your hair. You giggled, face in the crook of his neck, inhaling his sweet sent. His neck was so soft and he smelled so good, you thought.\u00a0<br/><br/>You made your way in between his legs, head laying on his chest. You proceeded to watch\u00a0whatever was playing on the television while giving his small hands a massage. You two stayed like that for a couple of minutes until your heard your sweet angel&rsquo;s voice :\u00a0<br/>\u201cAhhhh Hoseok is such a lucky guy to have you~. \u201c<br/>He murmured with a smirk, knowing this would emit a reaction from you. You choked on air before turning around, facing him, cheeks ruby colored. You yelled and started fake punching him in the chest. This sweet bean, aka Jimin, started laughing uncontrollably, hands wrapped around your waist. He then had the mischievous idea to start tickling you.\u00a0<br/>\u201c A-Ah STOP this is illegal!!&ldquo;<br/><br/>After around 30 seconds or so, the door flew open revealing Namjoon in his pj pants and white shirt clinging to his form.<br/><br/>\u201c whats all this fuss about ? \u201c<br/>He said while yawning. Oops? forgot to mention that it was super early, like 9am? Okay so what happened was that you couldn&rsquo;t sleep anymore, sooooo you just got up to see if someone was (hopefully) up as well. You ended up finding Jimin in the living room of the studio, in his cute pj, sipping on water and being the cutiepie he is.\u00a0</p><p>Okay back to where we were.\u00a0</p><p>&rdquo; it&rsquo;s him!! Save me Jooniiie &ldquo;\u00a0</p><p>You yelled between laughter, trying to escape Jimin&rsquo;s grasp. The (smol) man was basically on top of you straddling your hips. His hands were tickling you around your waist as you were running out of breath. RM only sighed, running a hand through his hair smirking looking at you two.\u00a0</p><p>Instead of helping you ( thx namjoon ), he opened the door and yelled</p><p>&rdquo; Hoseok your girl is in trouble, come save her &ldquo;\u00a0</p><p>You blushed at the mention of the name he used, momentarily forgetting that Jimin was tickling you with no mercy. On the other hand, when Jimin realized what RM shouted, he instantly got up and ran to the door locking it. The second he managed to lock\u00a0it, he heard pounding on the other side.\u00a0</p><p>&rdquo; You won&rsquo;t get her Hoseok she&rsquo;s mine now!&ldquo; Yelled Jimin between laughs, hands around his belly hurting from laughing too much.\u00a0</p><p>&rdquo; Jimin let my \uacf5\uc8fc\u00a0(princess) gooooooo! &ldquo; Yelled Hoseok from the other side of the door still pounding on it.</p><p>You just sat there, basking in the in the sun coming from the large windows, a smile plastered on your face. You couldn&rsquo;t have asked for nothing more in your entire life. You loved all the boys, and you loved life. You were thankful every single day for them.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon ( yes he was still stuck in the middle of that ) eyed you, thinking about if he should join this your crazy shenanigans or not. It was still pretty early and he had just woke up. He decided to go settle down on the couch, sitting right next to you.</p><p>You inhaled his scent, smelling his cologne. Namjoon stretched before laying down on his side, head on your thighs. You giggled softly when you heard him murmur your name. Joonie would always do that, just randomly plop down on your thighs lowkey asking you to mess with his blond hair.\u00a0</p><p>You silently obliged, hands starting from his nape, going up to his head,\u00a0massaging him. Namjoon let out a small moan, eyes closing with delight.\u00a0</p><p>Jimin turned around looking at the both of you mouth agape :</p><p>\u201c Hey! I want that massage too Y/N! \u201c</p><p>He yelled jumping up and down in excitement,\u00a0</p><p>\u201c WHAT!?? Massage? Y/N? My princess? Me too? Please? \u201c came Hoseok\u2019s muffled reply from outside the room. You could hear that he was jumping as well and pounding even harder on the wooden door.\u00a0</p><p>You laughed at their childish behaviors, gesturing for Jimin to open the door so you could finally see your precious Hobi.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon noticed your gesture lifting himself up, knowing that the second the door would open you would not be standing still anymore. When you and Hoseok were in the same room, there was nothing stopping you both.\u00a0</p><p>The door opened revealing a (smol) Hoseok sitting on the ground, legs\u00a0crossed. His squished cheek\u00a0was resting on his palm. He had been waiting for 10 minutes for Jimin to open the door, wanting to see you.</p><p>As soon as you two made eye contact, you started to run toward him, jumping in his laps. Your arms flew around his neck, hugging him tightly, making him almost fall back\u00a0on\u00a0the ground, leaning on his hands for support.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBabygirlllll~\u201d</p><p>mused Hoseok, nuzzling his face into the crook of your neck. Once he regained his composure, both of his arms snaked around your lower waist pulling you as close as you could be to his body.\u00a0</p><p>Your legs were on either side of his hips, straddling him, your core rubbing unconsciously against the growing tent in his pj pants.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGet a room you two\u201d shouted Namjoon playfully from the couch as Jimin chuckled leaving the room to go to the kitchen to get some food.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s smile was almost up to his ear as he massaged your lower back. He bit his lips containing the moans that wanted to escape his lips every time you would move your hips forward. \u00a0You loved teasing him, pleasuring him in every way possible and everywhere.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHold up tight baby\u201d</p><p>Before you even had time to understand what was going on, Hobi got up, hands planted firmly on your ass for support. You squealed nuzzling into his neck further, nails digging into his back as your legs wrapped around his waist trying to hold yourself up.</p><p>You started nibbling and sucking a little at his neck, wanting to leave a mark. He was yours, after all.\u00a0You knew the exact spot that would make Hoseok a moaning mess.\u00a0</p><p>So you went straight for it.</p><p>&quot;Fuck Y/N.. you&rsquo;re driving me crazy..&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok mumbled, hands squeezing your ass as he made his way toward his room. He started to let out multiple moans, when your tongue lapped at the bruised skin on his neck, reminding of what you had in store for your sunshine later.\u00a0</p><p>Hobi was very loud and\u00a0very vocal, in bed. ( or wherever you two would be when you would start pleasuring him ) Holding yourself up with one hand, the other slipped between your thighs to palm his growing erection. Hoseok momentarily stopped walking :</p><p>&ldquo; Baby you&rsquo;re so gorgeous. God you know you could make Daddy cum right here, right now if you continue like that&quot;\u00a0</p><p>And he obviously knew dirty talk was your soft spot. He bucked into your hand, letting you feel how big and hard he was.\u00a0</p><p>&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t wait to fuck your pretty pussy all day baby.\u00a0Make you scream my name so that they all know you&rsquo;re mine and only mine. &ldquo;</p><p>He growled the last part eyes getting dark with lust. You could feel your panties getting wetter trying to squish your thighs trying to get any sort of stimulation.\u00a0</p><p>&rdquo; Does my princess likes that? Huh?\u00a0\u00a0When her Daddy speaks like that? You think I didn&rsquo;t notice how your thighs just clenched right now, baby? I want to feel them clench around my head as I eat and enjoy, every single second, of that sweet pussy. &ldquo; Hoseok purred in your ear, opening the door of his bedroom and throwing you on the bed.</p><p>You gulped down, breath caught in your throat as you looked up at your man. Your eyes stopped at his crotch, those pj pants weren&rsquo;t hiding much. You automatically reached out, wanting to pleasure him as much as you could, but your hand got pushed away. You pouted, meeting Hoseok&rsquo;s lust full gaze.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Nah nah, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to disobey Daddy, would you? Today it&rsquo;s all about you baby, i&rsquo;m gonna feast on that dripping pussy\u00a0like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow&quot;\u00a0</p>",

Joonie would always do that, just randomly plop down on your thighs lowkey asking you to mess with his blond hair.\u00a0</p><p>You silently obliged, hands starting from his nape, going up to his head,\u00a0massaging him. Namjoon let out a small moan, eyes closing with delight.\u00a0</p><p>Jimin turned around looking at the both of you mouth agape :</p><p>\u201c Hey! I want that massage too Y/N! \u201c</p><p>He yelled jumping up and down in excitement,\u00a0</p><p>\u201c WHAT!?? Massage? Y/N? My princess? Me too? Please? \u201c came Hoseok\u2019s muffled reply from outside the room. You could hear that he was jumping as well and pounding even harder on the wooden door.\u00a0</p><p>You laughed at their childish behaviors, gesturing for Jimin to open the door so you could finally see your precious Hobi.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon noticed your gesture lifting himself up, knowing that the second the door would open you would not be standing still anymore. When you and Hoseok were in the same room, there was nothing stopping you both.\u00a0</p><p>The door opened revealing a (smol) Hoseok sitting on the ground, legs\u00a0crossed. His squished cheek\u00a0was resting on his palm. He had been waiting for 10 minutes for Jimin to open the door, wanting to see you.</p><p>As soon as you two made eye contact, you started to run toward him, jumping in his laps. Your arms flew around his neck, hugging him tightly, making him almost fall back\u00a0on\u00a0the ground, leaning on his hands for support.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBabygirlllll~\u201d</p><p>mused Hoseok, nuzzling his face into the crook of your neck. Once he regained his composure, both of his arms snaked around your lower waist pulling you as close as you could be to his body.\u00a0</p><p>Your legs were on either side of his hips, straddling him, your core rubbing unconsciously against the growing tent in his pj pants.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGet a room you two\u201d shouted Namjoon playfully from the couch as Jimin chuckled leaving the room to go to the kitchen to get some food.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s smile was almost up to his ear as he massaged your lower back. He bit his lips containing the moans that wanted to escape his lips every time you would move your hips forward. \u00a0You loved teasing him, pleasuring him in every way possible and everywhere.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHold up tight baby\u201d</p><p>Before you even had time to understand what was going on, Hobi got up, hands planted firmly on your ass for support. You squealed nuzzling into his neck further, nails digging into his back as your legs wrapped around his waist trying to hold yourself up.</p><p>You started nibbling and sucking a little at his neck, wanting to leave a mark. He was yours, after all.\u00a0You knew the exact spot that would make Hoseok a moaning mess.\u00a0</p><p>So you went straight for it.</p><p>\"Fuck Y/N.. you\u2019re driving me crazy..\u201d</p><p>Hoseok mumbled, hands squeezing your ass as he made his way toward his room. He started to let out multiple moans, when your tongue lapped at the bruised skin on his neck, reminding of what you had in store for your sunshine later.\u00a0</p><p>Hobi was very loud and\u00a0very vocal, in bed. ( or wherever you two would be when you would start pleasuring him ) Holding yourself up with one hand, the other slipped between your thighs to palm his growing erection. Hoseok momentarily stopped walking :</p><p>\u201c Baby you\u2019re so gorgeous. God you know you could make Daddy cum right here, right now if you continue like that\"\u00a0</p><p>And he obviously knew dirty talk was your soft spot. He bucked into your hand, letting you feel how big and hard he was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201d I can\u2019t wait to fuck your pretty pussy all day baby.\u00a0Make you scream my name so that they all know you\u2019re mine and only mine. \u201c</p><p>He growled the last part eyes getting dark with lust. You could feel your panties getting wetter trying to squish your thighs trying to get any sort of stimulation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201d Does my princess likes that? Huh?\u00a0\u00a0When her Daddy speaks like that? You think I didn\u2019t notice how your thighs just clenched right now, baby? I want to feel them clench around my head as I eat and enjoy, every single second, of that sweet pussy. \u201c Hoseok purred in your ear, opening the door of his bedroom and throwing you on the bed.</p><p>You gulped down, breath caught in your throat as you looked up at your man. Your eyes stopped at his crotch, those pj pants weren\u2019t hiding much. You automatically reached out, wanting to pleasure him as much as you could, but your hand got pushed away. You pouted, meeting Hoseok\u2019s lust full gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\"Nah nah, you wouldn\u2019t want to disobey Daddy, would you? Today it\u2019s all about you baby, i\u2019m gonna feast on that dripping pussy\u00a0like there\u2019s no tomorrow\"\u00a0</p>",

The blond haired man hugged you back tightly, nuzzling his nose in your hair. You giggled, face in the crook of his neck, inhaling his sweet sent. His neck was so soft and he smelled so good, you thought.\u00a0<br><br>You made your way in between his legs, head laying on his chest. You proceeded to watch\u00a0whatever was playing on the television while giving his small hands a massage. You two stayed like that for a couple of minutes until your heard your sweet angel\u2019s voice :\u00a0<br>\u201cAhhhh Hoseok is such a lucky guy to have you~. \u201c<br>He murmured with a smirk, knowing this would emit a reaction from you. You choked on air before turning around, facing him, cheeks ruby colored. You yelled and started fake punching him in the chest. This sweet bean, aka Jimin, started laughing uncontrollably, hands wrapped around your waist. He then had the mischievous idea to start tickling you.\u00a0<br>\u201c A-Ah STOP this is illegal!!\u201c<br><br>After around 30 seconds or so, the door flew open revealing Namjoon in his pj pants and white shirt clinging to his form.<br><br>\u201c whats all this fuss about ? \u201c<br>He said while yawning. Oops? forgot to mention that it was super early, like 9am? Okay so what happened was that you couldn\u2019t sleep anymore, sooooo you just got up to see if someone was (hopefully) up as well. You ended up finding Jimin in the living room of the studio, in his cute pj, sipping on water and being the cutiepie he is.\u00a0</p><p>Okay back to where we were.\u00a0</p><p>\u201d it\u2019s him!! Save me Jooniiie \u201c\u00a0</p><p>You yelled between laughter, trying to escape Jimin\u2019s grasp. The (smol) man was basically on top of you straddling your hips. His hands were tickling you around your waist as you were running out of breath. RM only sighed, running a hand through his hair smirking looking at you two.\u00a0</p><p>Instead of helping you ( thx namjoon ), he opened the door and yelled</p><p>\u201d Hoseok your girl is in trouble, come save her \u201c\u00a0</p><p>You blushed at the mention of the name he used, momentarily forgetting that Jimin was tickling you with no mercy. On the other hand, when Jimin realized what RM shouted, he instantly got up and ran to the door locking it. The second he managed to lock\u00a0it, he heard pounding on the other side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201d You won\u2019t get her Hoseok she\u2019s mine now!\u201c Yelled Jimin between laughs, hands around his belly hurting from laughing too much.\u00a0</p><p>\u201d Jimin let my \uacf5\uc8fc\u00a0(princess) gooooooo! \u201c Yelled Hoseok from the other side of the door still pounding on it.</p><p>You just sat there, basking in the in the sun coming from the large windows, a smile plastered on your face. You couldn\u2019t have asked for nothing more in your entire life. You loved all the boys, and you loved life. You were thankful every single day for them.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon ( yes he was still stuck in the middle of that ) eyed you, thinking about if he should join this your crazy shenanigans or not. It was still pretty early and he had just woke up. He decided to go settle down on the couch, sitting right next to you.</p><p>You inhaled his scent, smelling his cologne.
