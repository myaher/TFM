Have 1.3k of Shop Clerk!Dan and Oblivious!Phil. :)\u00a0</p><p><b>How do I look?</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><i>Of course the truly spectacular looking shop assistant just saw him in his pants, because that&rsquo;s just the type of luck Phil has. </i></p><p>1.3k</p><p>[<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17275178\">ao3 link</a>]</p><!-- more --><p>Phil shrugs into the jacket, the sleeves falling to the right length on his wrists, which is a bonus, because sometimes they&rsquo;re too short for how long all of his proportions are. He turns sideways in the mirror, checking out the back. Double vents so the back lies in a gentle curve over the top of his ass where he stands in his boxers. He hasn&rsquo;t decided on the trousers yet, but if he can get ones that are the right cut, he might even go as far as to say he looks good.<br/></p><p>Still, best to get a second opinion on these things. </p><p>&ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; he says, throwing the curtain back and maintaining a look at himself in the mirror. </p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; says a voice that is definitely not his friend, &ldquo;I think\u2026 your friend is&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>Phil turns, peeking out around the changing room doorway to see an unsuspecting store clerk with an arm full of hangers. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my\u2026 fuck,&rdquo; Phil says, yelping, looking down at his own legs, and then pulling the curtain back shut. </p><p>He hears a ring of full-bodied laughter from outside the curtain. </p><p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; the clerk says, &ldquo;nothing I haven&rsquo;t seen before.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil groans in frustration burying his face in his hands. Of course the truly spectacular looking shop assistant just saw him in his pants. Of course he did. Because that&rsquo;s just the type of luck Phil has. </p><p>Phil pulls on his jeans, red faced and hurrying so that his fingers fumble with the buttons at his fly.

Maybe I&rsquo;ll do the jeans and blazer thing, that&rsquo;s smart casual right?&rdquo;</p><p>Jimmy seems to consider it for a moment, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s acceptable.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go pay.&rdquo; </p><p>Jimmy waves him off and Phil goes to the far side of the store where the cash desk is.

Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan rings up his purchase and puts it in a paper bag, the kind with thin rope handles because of how fancy the store is. It&rsquo;s not his usual kind of place at all but Jimmy had insisted that they come in. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, if you wanted a shirt to go with that I could recommend something.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I\u2026 don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Phil says. He should just say no, but he likes the curve of Dan&rsquo;s smiles and the curl of his hair. He wants to keep talking to him. &ldquo;What kind of thing did you have in mind?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan gives him a look over from his head down to his shoes. It&rsquo;s obvious, lingering, in any other circumstance Phil would once again think Dan was coming on to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Something in black,&rdquo; Dan says, finally. </p><p>&ldquo;Black?&rdquo; Phil looks down at his outfit. He&rsquo;s got a white t-shirt with a loud print on it underneath a red bomber jacket. It&rsquo;s not exactly an understated outfit. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s my kind of thing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me? With that pale skin and black hair? You&rsquo;d have a whole monochrome aesthetic thing going on.&rdquo;</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t the usual way people say he&rsquo;s pale, or that his hair is too much of a contrast. He&rsquo;s being complimentary, which is probably all down to his good customer service skills and his wanting to up-sell Phil to a shirt along with his jacket. He&rsquo;s good, he&rsquo;ll give him that. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks but er\u2026 I&rsquo;ll stick with just the jacket.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan gives him and easy smile and tells him the total. Phil pays with his card, fingers only shaking slightly as he puts in his pin number for an amount that&rsquo;s probably a touch more expensive than he&rsquo;d intended to pay, but it had looked good. It had.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, there you go,&rdquo; Dan says, passing him the bag.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil takes his purchase and gives him a bit of a wave which he instantly thinks is the lamest thing he&rsquo;s ever done, and turns to leave the shop. </p><p>&ldquo;One more thing?&rdquo; Dan says from behind him, stopping him in his tracks. </p><p>Phil turns back to find Dan scribbling on the back of a blank bit of till roll. He stands back up, folds the paper in half and holds it out towards Phil over the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>Phil takes the piece of paper with his free hand and can&rsquo;t believe this is really happening. Things like this don&rsquo;t happen, do they? At least not to him. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my number,&rdquo; Dan says, clearing up any doubt Phil might have had about what could be written on the slip of paper in his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So you can, you know, call and ask me out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Er\u2026 thanks.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan smiles at him, grinning like he&rsquo;s just accomplished a feat worthy of praise. </p><p>&ldquo;I finish at six,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In case you wanted to wait until after work.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I\u2026 um\u2026 I will.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shoos him out of the shop, and Phil goes, still slightly in a daze with the paper clutched in his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Jimmy says, meeting him by the door, &ldquo;Was he flirting with you?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil looks down and the paper in his hand, unfolding it to see 11 digits written in the most untidy handwriting Phil has ever seen.

He\u2019s an idiot, Dan wasn\u2019t introducing himself he was giving him his name in case he needed assistance. Because that\u2019s his job. God Phil, he\u2019s not coming on to you. </p><p>\u201cI meant\u2026 Phil,\u201d Dan continues, \u201c&lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;.\u201d</p><p>Phil just nods and heads back out in to the shop. Jimmy is right there without a care in the world flipping through a rack of shirts. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Phil says, flopping his forehead dramatically against the bulk of Jimmy\u2019s bicep. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened? You were gone like ten minutes, what could you possibly have done?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am an idiot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUsually,\u201d Jimmy agrees. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>Phil lifts his head, \u201cI thought the shop guy was flirting with me. He wasn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d </p><p>Phil shrugs and then looks down at the rack of shirts. </p><p>\u201cAre you buying the jacket?\u201d Jimmy says. </p><p>\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t get around to trousers but I can do that another time. It\u2019s fine. Maybe I\u2019ll do the jeans and blazer thing, that\u2019s smart casual right?\u201d</p><p>Jimmy seems to consider it for a moment, \u201cThat\u2019s acceptable.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go pay.\u201d </p><p>Jimmy waves him off and Phil goes to the far side of the store where the cash desk is. He isn\u2019t shocked to find that it\u2019s Dan on the register when he gets there. He should have expected it really. </p><p>\u201cWell hello again,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you find everything you needed today?\u201d </p><p>Phil puts the jacket on the counter and smiles at him. \u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d </p><p>Dan rings up his purchase and puts it in a paper bag, the kind with thin rope handles because of how fancy the store is. It\u2019s not his usual kind of place at all but Jimmy had insisted that they come in. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if you wanted a shirt to go with that I could recommend something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know,\u201d Phil says. He should just say no, but he likes the curve of Dan\u2019s smiles and the curl of his hair. He wants to keep talking to him. \u201cWhat kind of thing did you have in mind?\u201d </p><p>Dan gives him a look over from his head down to his shoes. It\u2019s obvious, lingering, in any other circumstance Phil would once again think Dan was coming on to him. </p><p>\u201cSomething in black,\u201d Dan says, finally. </p><p>\u201cBlack?\u201d Phil looks down at his outfit. He\u2019s got a white t-shirt with a loud print on it underneath a red bomber jacket. It\u2019s not exactly an understated outfit. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s my kind of thing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? With that pale skin and black hair? You\u2019d have a whole monochrome aesthetic thing going on.\u201d</p><p>It isn\u2019t the usual way people say he\u2019s pale, or that his hair is too much of a contrast. He\u2019s being complimentary, which is probably all down to his good customer service skills and his wanting to up-sell Phil to a shirt along with his jacket. He\u2019s good, he\u2019ll give him that. </p><p>\u201cThanks but er\u2026 I\u2019ll stick with just the jacket.\u201d </p><p>Dan gives him and easy smile and tells him the total. Phil pays with his card, fingers only shaking slightly as he puts in his pin number for an amount that\u2019s probably a touch more expensive than he\u2019d intended to pay, but it had looked good. It had.</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go,\u201d Dan says, passing him the bag.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d </p><p>Phil takes his purchase and gives him a bit of a wave which he instantly thinks is the lamest thing he\u2019s ever done, and turns to leave the shop. </p><p>\u201cOne more thing?\u201d Dan says from behind him, stopping him in his tracks. </p><p>Phil turns back to find Dan scribbling on the back of a blank bit of till roll. He stands back up, folds the paper in half and holds it out towards Phil over the counter. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d Dan says. </p><p>Phil takes the piece of paper with his free hand and can\u2019t believe this is really happening. Things like this don\u2019t happen, do they? At least not to him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my number,\u201d Dan says, clearing up any doubt Phil might have had about what could be written on the slip of paper in his hand. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo you can, you know, call and ask me out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEr\u2026 thanks.\u201d </p><p>Dan smiles at him, grinning like he\u2019s just accomplished a feat worthy of praise. </p><p>\u201cI finish at six,\u201d he says. \u201cIn case you wanted to wait until after work.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2026 um\u2026 I will.\u201d </p><p>Dan shoos him out of the shop, and Phil goes, still slightly in a daze with the paper clutched in his hand. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jimmy says, meeting him by the door, \u201cWas he flirting with you?\u201d </p><p>Phil looks down and the paper in his hand, unfolding it to see 11 digits written in the most untidy handwriting Phil has ever seen. He\u2019s already reaching into his pocket for his phone as they leave the store. </p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d he says, \u201cI think he was.\u201d</p>",

He turns sideways in the mirror, checking out the back. Double vents so the back lies in a gentle curve over the top of his ass where he stands in his boxers. He hasn&rsquo;t decided on the trousers yet, but if he can get ones that are the right cut, he might even go as far as to say he looks good.<br /></p><p>Still, best to get a second opinion on these things. </p><p>&ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; he says, throwing the curtain back and maintaining a look at himself in the mirror. </p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; says a voice that is definitely not his friend, &ldquo;I think&hellip; your friend is&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>Phil turns, peeking out around the changing room doorway to see an unsuspecting store clerk with an arm full of hangers. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my&hellip; fuck,&rdquo; Phil says, yelping, looking down at his own legs, and then pulling the curtain back shut. </p><p>He hears a ring of full-bodied laughter from outside the curtain. </p><p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; the clerk says, &ldquo;nothing I haven&rsquo;t seen before.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil groans in frustration burying his face in his hands. Of course the truly spectacular looking shop assistant just saw him in his pants. Of course he did. Because that&rsquo;s just the type of luck Phil has. </p><p>Phil pulls on his jeans, red faced and hurrying so that his fingers fumble with the buttons at his fly. He yanks off the jacket, putting it back on the hanger and shoving his feet into his vans. </p><p>Fucking Jimmy, why the hell did he go off in to the shop? Why wouldn&rsquo;t he wait outside to offer an opinion and to warn him when drop dead fucking gorgeous men were waiting to see Phil&rsquo;s weedy ass in his underwear. </p><p>He waits for a few minutes before he feels ready to leave the safety of the changing cubicle, and inches the curtain open a little, sticking his head out to check the coast is clear. </p><p>Heaving a sigh of relief when he finds the space outside of the cubicles empty, he makes his way back down past the row of open curtains, to the entryway back in to the shop. That&rsquo;s when he runs out of luck. </p><p>&ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s worth,&rdquo; says a voice behind him, &ldquo;You looked good.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil closes his eyes for a full second, takes a breath, and turns around to face the fit-as-fuck assistant. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Phil says, forcing a smile on his face through his embarrassment. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to get the jacket.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah,&rdquo; the guys says, hanging the last of the hangers up on an empty rail. &ldquo;The jacket. That&rsquo;s what I meant.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil could swear that he winks, just bold-faced winks right at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Um&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dan,&rdquo; the guy says. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Riiight,&rdquo; Dan nods, &ldquo;I just meant, if you need anything.
