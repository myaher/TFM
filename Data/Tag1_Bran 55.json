        "answer": "<p>This does not annoy me, I have to admit. If they want to keep the audience engaged, the audience still needs to see things that make them ask questions. What was that about? What will that lead to? What will happen? If they tell us everything that will happen there\u2019s no suspense and there\u2019s no point in watching. (And this is why plans made on screen fail, like, 95% of the time.)</p><p>Anyway&hellip;</p><p><b>Bran has been watching Tyrion a lot.</b> I suppose Tyrion could\u2019ve just been curious about Bran and his powers and wanted to know more. He might not be getting any employee of the month awards any time soon, but he\u2019s had to have noticed that Sansa doesn\u2019t like Dny and that Jon\u2019s suddenly avoiding her. And <b>here\u2019s this weird deadpan kid who ~knows stuff~. Knowing stuff is Tyrion\u2019s thing! Perhaps all Tyrion was doing was getting to know the enemy. </b>And perhaps Bran took the opportunity to nudge a bit because divided loyalties and all.</p><p><b>There\u2019s this other thing I\u2019m interested in too that\u2019s sort of related.</b></p><p>After Jaime\u2019s trial, Jaime finds Bran in the godswood and they have a little chat.</p><blockquote><p><b>J:</b> Why didn&rsquo;t you tell them [about pushing him out the window]?<br/><b>B</b>: You won&rsquo;t be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.<br/><b>J:</b> What about afterwards?<br/><b>B:</b> How do you know there is an afterwards?<br/></p></blockquote><p>So&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. What kind of crucial help did Jaime give them? Did he do anything that was super important? I suppose he knighted Brienne and he later saved her, right? But other than that? This is a genuine question; I can\u2019t remember Jaime doing anything crucial. Did he save Arya? That would\u2019ve made sense. Does anyone remember?</p><p>But let\u2019s say he didn\u2019t, just for speculating\u2019s sake.</p><p><b>While Jaime definitely talks about the war against the Night King and his\u00a0\u201cafterwards\u201d refers to what happens after they\u2019ve won that particular battl</b>e&ndash;and it\u2019s clearly what we\u2019re supposed to think the conversation is about&ndash;why does it have to be what Bran is talking about?</p><p><b>Could Bran have meant another fight?</b> The fight against Dny and/or Cersei. The fight the Starks will inevitably find themselves in post aotd victory. And, while Jaime did survive the battle against the aotd and did get that afterwards he talked about, <b>what if he doesn\u2019t survive the next one?</b> Perhaps <i>that\u2019s </i>the\u00a0\u201cafterwards\u201d to which Bran was referring and implying Jaime might not live to see.</p><p><b>Perhaps Bran is nudging both Lannister men in certain directions to make sure the Starks endure.</b></p><p>In his talk with Jaime, Bran points out he pushed him out the window to<b> protect his family</b>. <i>The things we do for love</i>.

With all the mystery and fear and horror surrounding the Night King, I was expecting that there would have been an epic confrontation with him and the key heroes of GoT, specifically Bran and Jon.  Bran, because he&rsquo;s the Three-Eyed Raven and one of those still in touch with the ancient magic that led to the creation of the Night King.  Jon, because to me, there has to be more to his being the son of two ancient Houses than just the unification of the Seven Kingdoms.  I don&rsquo;t mind if Arya still ends up dealing the killing blow.  She&rsquo;s still a Stark and the blood of the First Men runs in her veins.  But only after the confrontation. In fact, it would have been great if the Night King and the remaining Starks - all of them: Jon, Bran, Sansa and Arya - were part of that final confrontation before his destruction.  And the Night King should have at least said something.  Not just act all scary and angry.  I mean, I want him to tell the Starks why he&rsquo;s so angry and why he wants to destroy the world that they know of.  </p><p>With all the buildup surrounding his character and his army of the undead, I just find the treatment of the Night King&rsquo;s death underwhelming.</p></p>",
