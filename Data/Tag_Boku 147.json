        "body": "<p>It had been a long day.<b><br/></b></p><p>A long fucking day.</p><p>When you finally got back to the castle, you immediately changed out of your dress and into your white nightgown. You were eternally thankful for Bernard for providing you with such comfortable clothing. </p><p>Since starting to live with Bakugou you grew a habit of taking a stroll through the castle. The castle was so large your enthusiastic curiosity craved to explore it\u2019s depths. Leading you to little detours through the corridor, discovering new rooms and corners. Some instances you ran into a few traps that were planted around the castle to protect from intruders. Bakugou having to come help you and naturally it didn\u2019t go without him scolding.</p><p><i>\u201cQuit wandering around if you\u2019re gonna get caught in traps all the time idiot! I don\u2019t have time to save you all the damn time while you\u2019re acting like some damsel in distress!\u201d</i></p><p>But of course those words went in through one ear and out the other.</p><!-- more --><p>On this night you walked along the open air hallway, that acted as a bridge connecting from one building to another. The bridge was high and the cool night air blew against your hair and dress. The moonlight illuminating against the white fabric of your gown. You looked down at the view below, seeing the dragon stables and the familiar ash blonde there as well. Reaching the other end of the bridge to the connecting building, you walked down its spiral steps and into the dragon stables. </p><p>\u201cYoohoo~\u201d you sang, skipping towards the male with hands behind your back. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d he groans, his attention fixated at the gear he tinkered with on his work desk. </p><p>\u201cNothing. Just taking a stroll and I saw you down here so here I am.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBack to bother me huh?\u201d</p><p>Skipping around in a circle and humming to yourself, \u201chmm maybe\u2026\u201d then changing your direction to the stables, skipping straight to the last stable. The aquamarine dragon, curled up sleeping in its corner, but starting to shift awake upon hearing the patter of your nearing feet.</p><p>\u201cHey small guy, how are you doing?\u201d you give it a soft smile, earning a small whine from the beast. \u201cOh sorry did I wake you? Hey Katsuki can I go in it\u2019s cage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure whatever. But don\u2019t blame me if it attacks you.\u201d he turns and walks to you. He takes a loop of keys out of his pocket and unlocking the cage. You walk in and slowly approach the small dragon. \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna hurt me. He\u2019s just scared, it just takes time and patience.\u201d once in front of the beast, it eyes you timidly. A slight tremble apparent in its large cobalt orbs. </p><p>\u201cHey it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m not gonna hurt you. I\u2019m not mean like that big scary man.\u201d the click of Bakugou\u2019s tongue audible behind you. </p><p>Extending your arm out, your fingertips brush lightly against its snout. The scales are smooth under your touch and you take the initiative to press your whole hand onto its face. </p><p>\u201cSee? I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d whispering softly. The dragon eases at your touch, and leans large head into your body until it\u2019s nose is nuzzled into your stomach. </p><p>\u201cI think he likes me\u201d you giggle. \u201cDoes he have a name Katsuki?\u201d scratching the top of the blue beasts head and turning to look at the male over your shoulder as he mumbles something incoherent.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChimalus\u201d</p><p>Your smile grew, and your eyes gleamed at the aquamarine beast. \u201cChimalus! What a nice name! Is there a meaning behind it?\u201d you queried. </p><p>\u201cYou always got a question after another. Look it up yourself if you wanna know so bad.\u201d walking back to his work table. </p><p>\u201cHmph he\u2019s never any fun. But it\u2019s ok little guy- or should I say big guy? Well you are smaller than the others- whatever! I\u2019m here now I\u2019ll be your new mama!\u201d you laugh as the dragon nuzzles further into your stomach tickling a sensitive stop. </p><p>After finishing playing with your newfound reptile child, you walk along the other sleeping dragons until you stopped in front of Bakugou\u2019s infamous red dragon.</p><p>\u201cHey Katsuki, how come you always use this red dragon? What\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou sighs, interrupted from his work once again. He had hoped you would be tired and done after spending time with the smaller dragon but here you were back again with your endless string of questions. </p><p><i>\u2018There\u2019s never any breaks with this damn girl\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cDo you ever rest?\u201d</p><p>Shaking your head. \u201cI\u2019ll rest when I\u2019m dead.\u201d you smile rocking against your heels, waiting for your answer.\u00a0\u201cThen I should just kill you right now&hellip; then maybe I\u2019d finally get some peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha go ahead and try!\u201d<br/></p><p>Sighing again and rubbing his face. He took a moment to compose himself before giving you your answer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not actually a dragon?\u201d</p><p>Cocking your head in confusion. It was obviously a dragon. You were staring right at it. It was a dragon?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? He\u2019s obviously-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026he\u2019s a friend of mine that got turned into a dragon. Some witch wanted to get back at me so the bitch put a spell on him that turned him into that.\u201d you gaze shifted from the sleeping beast to the ash blonde. A bit of pity in your eyes. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;Kirishima. Kirishima Eijirou\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan the spell be undone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno, those shitty wizards didn\u2019t help. Tried nearly everything.\u201d</p><p>It hurt your heart a little hearing that Bakugou had someone he at even called a friend. And to have the only person he considered a friend to be locked and kept away from him must\u2019ve been tough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><p>Bakugou chuckled, \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard you apologize to me. But it doesn\u2019t matter that guy annoyed me anyways.\u201d </p><p>Still you looked at the blonde with a sad pout. A small part of you felt sympathy for the male and a voice of your good conscience persuaded you to help the boy, or even provide more solace for him. You two always butted heads, constantly at each others tails over the smallest things and teased and poked each other to no end, but that doesn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t provide at least a bit of compassion or even as much as a shoulder to cry on. You knew how it felt to be kept away from people you cared about. You were a person with emotions just like anyone else, and you had feelings other than just anger and irritation towards the male. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2026we\u2019ll free him, I know we can\u2026\u201d you spoke in a small voice, but your words bore a tinge of confidence. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s gotta be at least one person or thing out there that can help him- Oh! There was a really powerful wizard my family was acquainted with, he broke this spell off of one of my father\u2019s knights when he got turned into a goat! Maybe we can ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u201d letting out a tired yawn and rolling out his tense shoulders, he was tired and it was about time for bed. You were still talking on to yourself about wizards and spells and what not, your long string of words and mindless rambling reminded him of a familiar green haired male. But yours didn\u2019t seem to quite irritate him as much as any other would. </p><p>He sighed, approaching you as his hand dug through his spikey locks to scratch at his scalp. \u201cQuit that chatter, you sound like fucking Deku. Don\u2019t sweat it, it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d lightly patting the top of your head, \u201cC\u2019mon kid it\u2019s past your curfew.

                "content": "<p>It had been a long day.<b><br /></b></p><p>A long fucking day.</p><p>When you finally got back to the castle, you immediately changed out of your dress and into your white nightgown. You were eternally thankful for Bernard for providing you with such comfortable clothing. </p><p>Since starting to live with Bakugou you grew a habit of taking a stroll through the castle. The castle was so large your enthusiastic curiosity craved to explore it&rsquo;s depths. Leading you to little detours through the corridor, discovering new rooms and corners. Some instances you ran into a few traps that were planted around the castle to protect from intruders. Bakugou having to come help you and naturally it didn&rsquo;t go without him scolding.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Quit wandering around if you&rsquo;re gonna get caught in traps all the time idiot! I don&rsquo;t have time to save you all the damn time while you&rsquo;re acting like some damsel in distress!&rdquo;</i></p><p>But of course those words went in through one ear and out the other.</p><p>On this night you walked along the open air hallway, that acted as a bridge connecting from one building to another. The bridge was high and the cool night air blew against your hair and dress. The moonlight illuminating against the white fabric of your gown. You looked down at the view below, seeing the dragon stables and the familiar ash blonde there as well. Reaching the other end of the bridge to the connecting building, you walked down its spiral steps and into the dragon stables. </p><p>&ldquo;Yoohoo~&rdquo; you sang, skipping towards the male with hands behind your back. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell are you doing here?&rdquo; he groans, his attention fixated at the gear he tinkered with on his work desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. Just taking a stroll and I saw you down here so here I am.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Back to bother me huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Skipping around in a circle and humming to yourself, &ldquo;hmm maybe&hellip;&rdquo; then changing your direction to the stables, skipping straight to the last stable. The aquamarine dragon, curled up sleeping in its corner, but starting to shift awake upon hearing the patter of your nearing feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey small guy, how are you doing?&rdquo; you give it a soft smile, earning a small whine from the beast. &ldquo;Oh sorry did I wake you? Hey Katsuki can I go in it&rsquo;s cage?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure whatever. But don&rsquo;t blame me if it attacks you.&rdquo; he turns and walks to you. He takes a loop of keys out of his pocket and unlocking the cage. You walk in and slowly approach the small dragon. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not gonna hurt me. He&rsquo;s just scared, it just takes time and patience.&rdquo; once in front of the beast, it eyes you timidly. A slight tremble apparent in its large cobalt orbs. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey it&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m not gonna hurt you. I&rsquo;m not mean like that big scary man.&rdquo; the click of Bakugou&rsquo;s tongue audible behind you. </p><p>Extending your arm out, your fingertips brush lightly against its snout. The scales are smooth under your touch and you take the initiative to press your whole hand onto its face. </p><p>&ldquo;See? I won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo; whispering softly. The dragon eases at your touch, and leans large head into your body until it&rsquo;s nose is nuzzled into your stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;I think he likes me&rdquo; you giggle. &ldquo;Does he have a name Katsuki?&rdquo; scratching the top of the blue beasts head and turning to look at the male over your shoulder as he mumbles something incoherent.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chimalus&rdquo;</p><p>Your smile grew, and your eyes gleamed at the aquamarine beast. &ldquo;Chimalus! What a nice name! Is there a meaning behind it?&rdquo; you queried. </p><p>&ldquo;You always got a question after another. Look it up yourself if you wanna know so bad.&rdquo; walking back to his work table. </p><p>&ldquo;Hmph he&rsquo;s never any fun. But it&rsquo;s ok little guy- or should I say big guy? Well you are smaller than the others- whatever! I&rsquo;m here now I&rsquo;ll be your new mama!&rdquo; you laugh as the dragon nuzzles further into your stomach tickling a sensitive stop. </p><p>After finishing playing with your newfound reptile child, you walk along the other sleeping dragons until you stopped in front of Bakugou&rsquo;s infamous red dragon.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Katsuki, how come you always use this red dragon? What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou sighs, interrupted from his work once again. He had hoped you would be tired and done after spending time with the smaller dragon but here you were back again with your endless string of questions. </p><p><i>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s never any breaks with this damn girl&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Do you ever rest?&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking your head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rest when I&rsquo;m dead.&rdquo; you smile rocking against your heels, waiting for your answer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Then I should just kill you right now&hellip; then maybe I&rsquo;d finally get some peace and quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haha go ahead and try!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sighing again and rubbing his face. He took a moment to compose himself before giving you your answer.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not actually a dragon?&rdquo;</p><p>Cocking your head in confusion. It was obviously a dragon. You were staring right at it. It was a dragon?</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? He&rsquo;s obviously-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip;he&rsquo;s a friend of mine that got turned into a dragon. Some witch wanted to get back at me so the bitch put a spell on him that turned him into that.&rdquo; you gaze shifted from the sleeping beast to the ash blonde. A bit of pity in your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Kirishima. Kirishima Eijirou&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can the spell be undone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dunno, those shitty wizards didn&rsquo;t help. Tried nearly everything.&rdquo;</p><p>It hurt your heart a little hearing that Bakugou had someone he at even called a friend. And to have the only person he considered a friend to be locked and kept away from him must&rsquo;ve been tough.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou chuckled, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard you apologize to me. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter that guy annoyed me anyways.&rdquo; </p><p>Still you looked at the blonde with a sad pout. A small part of you felt sympathy for the male and a voice of your good conscience persuaded you to help the boy, or even provide more solace for him. You two always butted heads, constantly at each others tails over the smallest things and teased and poked each other to no end, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you couldn&rsquo;t provide at least a bit of compassion or even as much as a shoulder to cry on. You knew how it felt to be kept away from people you cared about. You were a person with emotions just like anyone else, and you had feelings other than just anger and irritation towards the male. </p><p>&ldquo;We&hellip;we&rsquo;ll free him, I know we can&hellip;&rdquo; you spoke in a small voice, but your words bore a tinge of confidence. </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s gotta be at least one person or thing out there that can help him- Oh! There was a really powerful wizard my family was acquainted with, he broke this spell off of one of my father&rsquo;s knights when he got turned into a goat! Maybe we can ask him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe&rdquo; letting out a tired yawn and rolling out his tense shoulders, he was tired and it was about time for bed. You were still talking on to yourself about wizards and spells and what not, your long string of words and mindless rambling reminded him of a familiar green haired male. But yours didn&rsquo;t seem to quite irritate him as much as any other would. </p><p>He sighed, approaching you as his hand dug through his spikey locks to scratch at his scalp. &ldquo;Quit that chatter, you sound like fucking Deku. Don&rsquo;t sweat it, it&rsquo;s not a big deal.&rdquo; lightly patting the top of your head, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon kid it&rsquo;s past your curfew. We&rsquo;ll be talking about the war plan tomorrow, so I need you up, alert with your utmost undivided attention.&rdquo; </p><p>You puffed out your cheeks with your brows furrowed angrily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a kid!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah yeah whatever you say princess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not a princess!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever I&rsquo;m tired brat, night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmph! Good night!&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>i want to say THANK YOU FOR 500 FOLLOWERS. its been a pleasure writing for you all. im happy you really enjoy my writing and all the other shit i be posting.
