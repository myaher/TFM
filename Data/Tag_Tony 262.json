He immediately opened his eyes and clapped\nhis hands twice to turn the lights on before rubbing his eyes to get a clear\nview.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; the billionaire asked himself\nas he slowly got out of bed and stretched, slight anxiety rushing through his\nbody as he wondered where you were. &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; he said and cleared his throat, &ldquo;Please\nlocate my wife&rdquo; he said while quickly slipping into a pair of boxers and sweats\nbefore entered the bathroom and seeing that you also weren&rsquo;t in there.</p><p>&ldquo;[Y/N] is in the kitchen, she has\nsound proof it&rdquo; the artificially intelligent system responded to which Tony hummed\nin confusion. &ldquo;Deactivate&rdquo; he said while walking over to the door. Suddenly,\nEarth Win &amp; Fire&rsquo;s September was heard blasting from the kitchen to which\nthe billionaire burst out laughing and shaking his head while making his way to\nyou.</p><p>Once Tony entered the kitchen,\nhe found you dancing in the middle of it while singing out loud to the song.\nYou were twirling around while rubbing your eight-month-old pregnant belly\nwhile laughing to yourself when you had to take regular breaks to catch your\nbreath.</p><p>The sight of you having fun\nand dancing around, despite that your feet were swollen, made your husband bite\nhis lip as he was in total awe of you. You just dancing there in an oversized\nshirt and booty shorts and still looked like a beautiful angel.</p><p><i>&#127925; </i><i>Ba de ya, golden dreams were shiny days </i><i>&#127925;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>You sang before turning around\nand jumping in surprise upon seeing Tony standing a few feet away from you with\nan amused smile on his face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Friday&rdquo; you told the intelligent\nsystem who immediately stopped the song, silence now filling the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey babe&rdquo; you smiled chuckled\nwhen your husband walked up to you and wrapped his strong arms around your\nthick waist, your huge belly getting most of the embrace. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;\nTony asked and smiled once he felt your son kick against his stomach. </p><p>You sighed and hissed, &ldquo;He\njust won&rsquo;t go to sleep&rdquo; Tony furrowed his eyebrows, &ldquo;Your son has been kicking\nme for hours, thinking that my womb is a soccer field&rdquo; you rolled your eyes as\nyou remembered how you weren&rsquo;t able to sleep because of your baby boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Dancing somehow always puts\nhim to sleep so here I am, dancing my ass off so that I can get a few hours of\nsleep myself&rdquo; you chuckled and watched your husband shake his head while his\nhands gently caressed your belly, making your baby boy kick again.</p><p>&ldquo;My son is already a trouble\nmaker and he isn&rsquo;t even born yet&rdquo; Tony chuckled with a pride smile on his face,\nstill so happy about becoming a father very soon. You hummed, pursed your lips\nand nodded your head, &ldquo;Wonder who he got that from&rdquo;.</p><p>Your comment made Tony throw\nhis head back and let out a loud laugh which made you join him as the two of\nyou knew that you&rsquo;d be in so much trouble once baby Stark would be born. Tony bent\ndown so that he could face your belly and placed his index finger on your belly\nbutton, &ldquo;Listen here son, we are going to dance you to sleep and then you will\nlet your mommy rest, okay? &nbsp;She will need\nall the energy she has to give birth to you and take care of you the following\neighteen years&rdquo; his words made you chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, please start the song\nover please&rdquo; Tony announced and seconds later, the first tunes of September blasted\nthrough the kitchen. You smiled and immediately began to move your body while\nyour husband did the same, taking a hold of your hands before the two of you\ndancing your hearts out while laughing with each other.</p><p>Your baby boy fell asleep\nthree songs later which left you so relieved and exhausted with achy feet.

She is looking for one Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes.</p><p>And now she&rsquo;s found him, a mess of blood, sweat and tears passed out at her feet. Toni would barely be able to look at the mutilated mess of his arm if she hadn&rsquo;t experienced Afghanistan. Still, it is with a forced composure that she keeps herself from vomiting right there. </p><p>How did he survive this? Screw that, how long has he been here?</p><p>Toni continues to muse about this as she removes the tangled iron rail from what remains of his left arm and hauls him back to her time machine. </p><p>Yup, her time machine. </p><p>In your face Howard!</p><p>Finally, she has him inside the TARDIS. Yes, TARDIS - she\u2019s a Dr. Who fan - what else could she call this magnificent machine? Despite her best efforts, Barnes is a bloody mess. Gore everywhere and to top it off-she has only one cot. What was she thinking? Not the best of circumstances but he is alive.</p><p>The bigger issue was how Barnes was bleeding out on the said cot. Toni had no idea how to amputate limbs and no first aid kit. Well, first aid kit big enough for Barnes\u2019 predicament. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t unfair that Toni hadn\u2019t thought of it. She just thought that HYDRA had amputated Barnes\u2019 arm for \u2018funsies\u2019. They were twisted enough to do it! </p><p>There was no use getting so wound up about it, Toni was already at the helm of the TARDIS, punching in a year and place that could do something about it. </p><p>As the TARDIS booted up, Toni found herself drifting back to her incapacitated guest. </p><p>Pressure on the wound, but the tears of flesh and sinew were just&ndash; </p><p>How was he alive?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. What was done, was done. Toni tears what\u2019s left of his uniform from his body to help staunch his wounds. The arm\u2019s unsalvageable, that\u2019s for sure. </p><p>Toni wishes she could have gone back farther in time but Barnes\u2019 fall from the train was a \u2018Fixed Point\u2019 for some reason. Life changing for Cap she supposes. </p><p>It is useless to think about what might have been. There was no choice. To go back to an earlier time would risk all of their futures. Cap\u2019s plane crash into the Arctic must be preserved in the timeline, even it means Sergeant Barnes\u2019 current predicament. \u00a0</p><p>The buzzing of the machinery calms Toni down and she continues to examine Barnes. What he\u2019s wearing is sopping wet and she can tell with the press of her cheek against his forehead that he\u2019s suffering hypothermia. </p><p>Thank Thor for Toni\u2019s Titanic phase. She knows what to do. She has to cut his clothing to get it off of him. She can&rsquo;t risk him dying of a heart attack because of some careless movements. The blankets on the cot are thick so she wraps him in it. </p><p>By the time she\u2019s done all of this his breath is still stuttering but at least it\u2019s progress. If only she\u2019d packed heat compresses - oh well, just another thing to pick up after Barnes is stitched up. As well stitched as he can be. </p>",

But more importantly, he can see\nhis eyes.</p><p>Tony remembers the vibrant blue that Barton\u2019s eyes had\nglowed when he\u2019d been under the control of Loki and his sceptre, and he\nremembers the bright scarlet that had ringed Thor\u2019s pupils that Christmas when\nWanda had taken control of his mind (at his request) and made him think it was\nsnowing indoors. This is the same, and different.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes just look like Peter\u2019s eyes\u2026but they\u2019re clouded\n- smoky tendrils curling through the warm brown like mist floating over a lake.</p><p>And he remembers now that the kid had mentioned he had a run\nin with that fishbowl guy \u2013 Mysterio \u2013 earlier that day. Tony had brushed it\noff because at that point the guy had been little more than a nuisance, parlour\ntricks and smoke-screen robberies, but now \u2013 <i>now, </i>the man has signed his own death warrant.</p><p>Peter speaks slowly, hesitantly. </p><p>\u201cShe \u2013 she\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>He looks so torn, so confused, so <i>hopeful, </i>that Tony feels the flames of rage igniting in his chest.\nHe\u2019s going to smash that fishbowl to pieces.</p><p>\u201cI promise, kid,\u201d he says, edging forward slightly, then\nfurther when Peter doesn\u2019t back up or move away.
