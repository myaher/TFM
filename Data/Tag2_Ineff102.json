Crowley watched the back of his head, curls seeming to be set on fire in the glow of the setting sun, reminiscent of the halo which had rested above them long ago, and sighed softly as the angel leaned into him.

Six thousand years of knowing each other and talking to each other and sharing drinks and food and then more drinks and sometimes more food after that. He&rsquo;d heard every one of the angel&rsquo;s spontaneous, idiosyncratic little thoughts, familiarized himself with every one of his habits and memorized every line in his face, and yet every day he spent with Aziraphale was another day he was happy to have known. Alone, he was in his element. He was cool, he was suave, he was always on top of everything. With Aziraphale, he was thrown off guard every other minute, he was tumbling through the strange feeling of perhaps, just maybe, not being the smartest person in the room, nor the most loved. He was whole, with the angel. He knew himself, and then he knew himself-with-Aziraphale. With the angel, he voiced doubts,admittedly through a thick veneer of faked cynical apathy, and was returned them twofold. </p><p>He could stay here forever with the angel under his arm, was complete with the angel, and could never have lived without him. <i>Someone</i>, had he really just thought that?

He would set the world on fire for Aziraphale, he knew. But greater still than that, he would save the world for him. He already had, in a way. He loved humanity, loved the world, but always Aziraphale had brought it to light, in evenings spent in London bars getting drunk with Shakespeare, days in medieval Constantinople eating fruit on plush divans, sunrises in Ur where Aziraphale pointed out the shape of the ziggurats, said he&rsquo;d been very proud of those, and Crowley remembered the commendation for future archeological bafflement he&rsquo;d gotten. He would die for his angel, and now, he thought, he was living for his angel. </p><p>Always it had been this way, and always it would remain this way, and now the thought struck Crowley that, this way that he&rsquo;d loved Aziraphale, had always been returned to him. That the warmth of Aziraphale&rsquo;s smiles and the gentleness of his touch and the lilt of his laugh had led him along the same path at whose end, at the edge of the yellow wood of loving and living and knowing, Crowley now found himself. And Crowley allowed himself to sink into the comfortable warmth of the angel beneath him, and pressed a kiss into his curls, and was content to find that the kiss was returned into the crook of his neck as he saw the water shimmer beyond them, the last light of the sun disappearing to let the stars take its place, and the breeze being ever so slightly too cool for anyone not wrapped in the arms of another</p>",
