Tony and the other avengers are in the middle of this, and sometimes (most of the times) have to endure Peter's or Harley's pranks, and soon the avengers pick sides and join the prank war :)",
        "answer": "<p>I would not envy the souls who get in between the two boys.\u00a0</p><p>Send help for their poor souls.<br/></p><p>\u00a0First off I believe the two boys would start the whole prank war with something pretty petty. Like when Harley ate the last pineapple pizza when Peter was in the bathroom, the time Harley bought 5 cartons of mint ice cream even though he knew Peter despised mint with a burning passion, or that time where Harley chased Peter down for throwing a bunch of potatoes at him\u00a0\u2018FOR THE MEMES\u2019. That\u2019s pretty much how the war would start! They\u2019re both salty and need revenge cause they\u2019re just like that.</p><p>Now to the utter torture that was the weeks before the War of Parkner.</p><p>The Avengers were terrified. Like out right scared for their lives. The first day was a living nightmare. Natasha being the super awesome spy she is noticed the tensions rising in the tower so she thought best to go on a road trip for a few weeks with Wanda and Vision. Rhodey knew what was up so him and Nebula joined too because they ain\u2019t about to die an early death.</p><p>They were the only ones spared from the massacre that was the many battles of Parkner.</p><p>Anyway, for the first few days of the prank wars Peter and Harley absolutely went ham. One time Peter decided to web up the training room into a whole maze and once you got caught no one ever gets out. That was the day where they lost Clint. There\u2019s no question about it they just LOST HIM. It\u2019s okay though because you can still hear his screams somewhere in the tower!</p><p>At this point every one is pretty terrified. Harley already pelted them with potatoes that morning and it hurt like a bitch. No one has seen Harley or Peter for a few days and that started to worry them. Sam, Bucky, and Steve always have to check the tower on a daily basis now. Tony locked himself in the lab so he didn\u2019t have to deal with the after math that was the war. Carol was laughing her ass off while simultaneously being on alert. Did I mention that EVERYONE was a little scared? Except Pepper, Pepper was just done with this household. At some point Morgan wanted to join to ,but Tony refused to be killed by his children that day.</p><p>As soon as they heard about what they did to Steve the Avengers soon picked sides to have some alliance with at least one of the teens. Poor Steve got trapped in a room and had to watch all his PSAs for 9 hours straight.\u00a0</p><p>He was mortified after he came pack from the room he had dubbed as\u00a0\u2018The American Hell Hole\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>Carol, Sam, and Bucky joined Harley\u2019s army of destruction. Sam and Bucky were both still salty that Peter kicked their asses so that was a given. Carol just liked watching Harley physically and mentally torturing Steve. Meanwhile Steve, a hesitant Bruce, and Scott joined Peter\u2019s team. They were all too scared of the boy\u2019s webs to do anything.

Ned had stopped to help some civilians out of the rubble of fallen buildings.

All you were concerned about was Peter, your boyfriend of two years fighting against whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cPeter Benjamin Parker I swear to god!\u201d You cried out as you frantically began looking for him within the large groups of people. He was nowhere to be found. You pushed back the tears and continued pushing through the crowd of people. You felt your heart leap out of your chest as you saw, at the edge of the crow, Peter. There he stood in his spider-man suit, normally well kept, it was now tattered and covered in dust. Before you could even process what was happening you shoved people out of the way, your feet pounding against the ground as you tried your hardest to reach him.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u201d He stuttered out, as he collapsed into your arms. He let his weak body fall, and your knees buckled. You knelt down, holding his upper body in your arms. </p><p>\u201cP-p-pete\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 baby\u2026\u201d He choked out with a small chuckle.

No, you didn\u2019t. You think yo-you have to prove yourself but you don\u2019t! You\u2019re the strongest person I know.\u201d You sobbed leaning your head against his. When you pulled yourself back up, he moved a shaky hand up to your cheek.</p><p><b>\u201cDo you think you could\u2019ve loved me?\u201d</b> He choked out, now coughing up bits of blood. You nodded your head and blinked through teary eyes, looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I love you so much. More than you could e-ever know\u2026\u201d You whispered, pulling him closer to you.</p><p>\u201cI-I love you (Y/N)\u2026\u201d He whispered, and then silence. His chest stopped rising. His body went limp in your arms. His eyes stared back at you, normally full of life. This time they had none.</p><p>\u201cNo no no no no no, dammit!<b> I am not losing you again!</b> Peter please!\u201d You let out a blood-curdling scream as the streets around you were now empty.</p><p><b>\u201cYou can\u2019t die. Please don\u2019t die</b>! Peter come on babe\u2026 wake up. PETER!\u201d You yelled placing your hands on his chest and balling up the suit into your fist.</p><p>\u201cP-p-please\u2026 I love you.\u201d You whispered against his skin. Now lifeless, and cold. You had just lost the one thing that brought meaning to your life. Peter Parker was always there to brighten your day, you were there to take care of him. And now he was gone.</p>",

All you were concerned about was Peter, your boyfriend of two years fighting against whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cPeter Benjamin Parker I swear to god!\u201d You cried out as you frantically began looking for him within the large groups of people. He was nowhere to be found. You pushed back the tears and continued pushing through the crowd of people. You felt your heart leap out of your chest as you saw, at the edge of the crow, Peter. There he stood in his spider-man suit, normally well kept, it was now tattered and covered in dust. Before you could even process what was happening you shoved people out of the way, your feet pounding against the ground as you tried your hardest to reach him.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u201d He stuttered out, as he collapsed into your arms. He let his weak body fall, and your knees buckled. You knelt down, holding his upper body in your arms. </p><p>\u201cP-p-pete\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 baby\u2026\u201d He choked out with a small chuckle. You shook your head and let the tears slide down your cheeks onto his own face.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Peter\u2026 w-why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cNO! Peter! No, you didn\u2019t. You think yo-you have to prove yourself but you don\u2019t! You\u2019re the strongest person I know.\u201d You sobbed leaning your head against his. When you pulled yourself back up, he moved a shaky hand up to your cheek.</p><p><b>\u201cDo you think you could\u2019ve loved me?\u201d</b> He choked out, now coughing up bits of blood. You nodded your head and blinked through teary eyes, looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I love you so much. More than you could e-ever know\u2026\u201d You whispered, pulling him closer to you.</p><p>\u201cI-I love you (Y/N)\u2026\u201d He whispered, and then silence. His chest stopped rising. His body went limp in your arms. His eyes stared back at you, normally full of life. This time they had none.</p><p>\u201cNo no no no no no, dammit!<b> I am not losing you again!</b> Peter please!\u201d You let out a blood-curdling scream as the streets around you were now empty.</p><p><b>\u201cYou can\u2019t die. Please don\u2019t die</b>! Peter come on babe\u2026 wake up. PETER!\u201d You yelled placing your hands on his chest and balling up the suit into your fist.</p><p>\u201cP-p-please\u2026 I love you.\u201d You whispered against his skin. Now lifeless, and cold. You had just lost the one thing that brought meaning to your life. Peter Parker was always there to brighten your day, you were there to take care of him. And now he was gone.</p>",

        "body": "<h1>Braving The Cold</h1><p>Happy wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p>Okay. No big deal. He could walk home. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time, and it definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be the last. Except it was the middle of winter and he was not properly dressed to make the walk back home. He could always call Stephen, but he didn&rsquo;t want to bother him about something as trivial as a walk in the cold. The man had more important things to worry about.</p><p>So he set off towards the subway. That was only a five minute walk, and the ride itself would be another five but at least he would be out of the elements. From the subway to the tower would be ten minutes. Fifteen at most.</p><p>Peter jumps into the train just before the door closes and vigorously rubs his hands together and breathes on them. Shit. He was already shivering. He didn&rsquo;t think it was that cold outside.</p><p>The teen jumps out at his stop, zips his sweater all the way up, and throws his hood on after putting his earphones in. Hopefully the music would distract him from the cold. It did for a little while, until about halfway to the tower when he began to shiver so violently, it hurt. <i>Just a little farther</i>, he thought. Then he could curl up on the couch with a heavy blanket and maybe even Levi, and ask Dad to make him some hot chocolate.</p><p>Oh good. He wasn&rsquo;t shivering anymore.</p><p>Some part of his brain screamed at him saying no, this was very bad. That he needed to find help. Well&hellip;the tower was in view so he would have help soon enough.</p><p>Peter stumbles inside and toward the private elevator, makes a few attempts to press the button for the family floor, and then tilts his head back against the wall when the correct button lights up. His vision swam now that he was standing still, and he had to lift one if his arms up just to be sure he was still wearing clothes because he was <i>so cold</i>. As soon as the elevator doors open, he staggers out and slowly makes his way to the kitchen where he finds Tony sitting at the table with coffee and a Starkpad. His father looks up upon his arrival and the smile he had quickly turns into one of horror when Peter decided to get friendly with the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; Tony scrambles out of his seat and drops to his knees, and Peter nuzzles his face into the engineer&rsquo;s hand when he touches it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ice cold! FRIDAY, tell Stephen to get here right the fuck now!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t really aware of what happened after that, but he did feel himself being carried at one point, and then he was against something warm and it was <i>heaven</i>. He used whatever strength he had left to press himself against the heat as he felt himself being cocooned. His senses gradually came back after what seemed like forever and the first thing he smelt was tea leaves and incense. He knew that scent belonged to somebody but he couldn&rsquo;t quite put his finger on it yet. The first thing he heard was yelling and it sounded both angry and worried and that upset him so he returned his focus to the smell.</p><p>Tea leaves and incense. Tea leaves and incense&hellip;</p><p>Stephen.</p><p>Peter slowly opens his eyes to find himself pressed against the sorcerer&rsquo;s bare chest and his nose buried in his collarbone. Okay. He solved that mystery, but it wasn&rsquo;t Stephen who was yelling. In fact, the man was silent as he rubbed soothing circles onto the teen&rsquo;s bare back where Levi was gently resting. So the cloak was the cocoon.</p><p>That only left the obvious answer that Tony must be the one yelling. It took a couple more seconds of focus for his sense of hearing to come back and Peter cringes at the sudden onslaught of noise.</p><p>&ldquo;There was no text Happy! I checked his phone! Next time you sit outside the gates if you can&rsquo;t wait in your usual spot! I never want to see my kid take a nose dive to the floor like that again!&rdquo; Tony mumbles incoherently when, Peter assumes, he hangs up the phone. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s he doing Mama Bear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming back. He could probably handle something warm to drink now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hot chocolate for the baby. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p><p>Even if Peter could speak, he wouldn&rsquo;t try to deny being called a baby. He probably looked like one curled up against Stephen, and it felt too nice for him to care. Although when he did manage to croak out some semblance of a word it was, &ldquo;Mum.&rdquo; How British of him.</p><p>Stephen&rsquo;s chest vibrates with his chuckles. &ldquo;Feeling better Spiderling?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hnn.&rdquo; Because really, that&rsquo;s how he felt and that&rsquo;s all he could muster.</p><p>A collection of relieved sighs reaches Peter&rsquo;s ears and he attempts to lift his impossibly heavy head to see who else was them. The sorcerer pushes his head back down to his collarbone and Peter miraculously doesn&rsquo;t fight him. The warm swathe Stephen had him trapped in was too nice anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter would recognize that Russian lilt anywhere. Natasha was talking to someone. Someone who apparently didn&rsquo;t take her warning seriously because Stephen&rsquo;s magic crackles around them before pushing away whoever got too close. That someone curses when they hit the floor and others in the room laugh at their misfortune.</p><p>Rhodey was the next to speak. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Mom Mode Barton. Strange is in full-on Mama Bear Mode. Only Tones is getting close.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter felt Stephen&rsquo;s grumble before he heard it. &ldquo;Please stop talking about me like I&rsquo;m not here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, I was just worried about the kid. You didn&rsquo;t need to throw me across the room!&rdquo;</p><p>The Avengers ignore him and go back to their separate activities, and Peter soon feels himself being extracted from his cocoon to which he whines pathetically. He was comfortable!</p><p>&ldquo;I know Underoos&hellip;but I brought hot chocolate. Drink this then you can snuggle with Mama Bear all you want.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t about to argue with that, so he accepts the mug of chocolate and slowly drinks the contents with Levi still wrapped around his shoulders. He ignores the concerned glances from their teammates because he was beginning to suspect that he passed out in front of them, and that was embarrassing. Not including the cuddle fest he had with Stephen, but that was something they were used to seeing.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Peter asks quietly and vaguely registers the sorcerer putting his shirt back on.</p><p>Tony and Stephen look at each other and the billionaire sighs. &ldquo;You shaved about ten years of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We think your spider DNA keeps you from thermoregulating.&rdquo; The sorcerer finally answers.</p><p>Tony snorts. &ldquo;Yeah. So let&rsquo;s not have a repeat of today. If Happy isn&rsquo;t there, you call someone alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods numbly. &ldquo;Yeah. Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>He places his empty mug on the coffee table, his body pleasantly warm and fuzzy, and then practically falls back over onto Stephen and nuzzles his shoulder. Levi wiggles away and floats behind the couch as Tony replaces the cloak with a heavy blanket and then briefly moves the pair&rsquo;s feet to sit on the couch. He moves their feet back onto his lap, places his own on the coffee table, and then glances around at the full living room.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do I bother giving you guys your own floors if you keep taking over mine?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiles but doesn&rsquo;t look up from his notepad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just up here for that snuggle burrito over there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pretend you&rsquo;re drawing fluffy kittens if you give me a copy of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;</p><p>Soft snores draw the attention of every single person in the room and Tony had to cover his mouth to hide the fond smile that broke to the surface. The snores not only came from Peter, but also from Stephen whose cheek was resting on top of the teen&rsquo;s head. Brown curls were all that anyone could see since the blanket was pulled up to Peter&rsquo;s nose and the rest of his face was hidden in the sorcerer&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Strange officially has his cub.&rdquo; Nat whispers affectionately.</p><p>Everyone, including Tony, chokes on their laughter.</p>",

It wasn\u2019t the first time, and it definitely wouldn\u2019t be the last. Except it was the middle of winter and he was not properly dressed to make the walk back home. He could always call Stephen, but he didn\u2019t want to bother him about something as trivial as a walk in the cold. The man had more important things to worry about.</p><p>So he set off towards the subway. That was only a five minute walk, and the ride itself would be another five but at least he would be out of the elements. From the subway to the tower would be ten minutes. Fifteen at most.</p><p>Peter jumps into the train just before the door closes and vigorously rubs his hands together and breathes on them. Shit. He was already shivering. He didn\u2019t think it was that cold outside.</p><p>The teen jumps out at his stop, zips his sweater all the way up, and throws his hood on after putting his earphones in. Hopefully the music would distract him from the cold. It did for a little while, until about halfway to the tower when he began to shiver so violently, it hurt. <i>Just a little farther</i>, he thought. Then he could curl up on the couch with a heavy blanket and maybe even Levi, and ask Dad to make him some hot chocolate.</p><p>Oh good. He wasn\u2019t shivering anymore.</p><p>Some part of his brain screamed at him saying no, this was very bad. That he needed to find help. Well\u2026the tower was in view so he would have help soon enough.</p><p>Peter stumbles inside and toward the private elevator, makes a few attempts to press the button for the family floor, and then tilts his head back against the wall when the correct button lights up. His vision swam now that he was standing still, and he had to lift one if his arms up just to be sure he was still wearing clothes because he was <i>so cold</i>. As soon as the elevator doors open, he staggers out and slowly makes his way to the kitchen where he finds Tony sitting at the table with coffee and a Starkpad. His father looks up upon his arrival and the smile he had quickly turns into one of horror when Peter decided to get friendly with the floor.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Tony scrambles out of his seat and drops to his knees, and Peter nuzzles his face into the engineer\u2019s hand when he touches it. \u201cYou\u2019re ice cold! FRIDAY, tell Stephen to get here right the fuck now!\u201d</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t really aware of what happened after that, but he did feel himself being carried at one point, and then he was against something warm and it was <i>heaven</i>. He used whatever strength he had left to press himself against the heat as he felt himself being cocooned. His senses gradually came back after what seemed like forever and the first thing he smelt was tea leaves and incense. He knew that scent belonged to somebody but he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it yet. The first thing he heard was yelling and it sounded both angry and worried and that upset him so he returned his focus to the smell.</p><p>Tea leaves and incense. Tea leaves and incense\u2026</p><p>Stephen.</p><p>Peter slowly opens his eyes to find himself pressed against the sorcerer\u2019s bare chest and his nose buried in his collarbone. Okay. He solved that mystery, but it wasn\u2019t Stephen who was yelling. In fact, the man was silent as he rubbed soothing circles onto the teen\u2019s bare back where Levi was gently resting. So the cloak was the cocoon.</p><p>That only left the obvious answer that Tony must be the one yelling. It took a couple more seconds of focus for his sense of hearing to come back and Peter cringes at the sudden onslaught of noise.</p><p>\u201cThere was no text Happy! I checked his phone! Next time you sit outside the gates if you can\u2019t wait in your usual spot! I never want to see my kid take a nose dive to the floor like that again!\u201d Tony mumbles incoherently when, Peter assumes, he hangs up the phone. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing Mama Bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming back. He could probably handle something warm to drink now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot chocolate for the baby. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Even if Peter could speak, he wouldn\u2019t try to deny being called a baby. He probably looked like one curled up against Stephen, and it felt too nice for him to care. Although when he did manage to croak out some semblance of a word it was, \u201cMum.\u201d How British of him.</p><p>Stephen\u2019s chest vibrates with his chuckles. \u201cFeeling better Spiderling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHnn.\u201d Because really, that\u2019s how he felt and that\u2019s all he could muster.</p><p>A collection of relieved sighs reaches Peter\u2019s ears and he attempts to lift his impossibly heavy head to see who else was them. The sorcerer pushes his head back down to his collarbone and Peter miraculously doesn\u2019t fight him. The warm swathe Stephen had him trapped in was too nice anyway.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d </p><p>Peter would recognize that Russian lilt anywhere. Natasha was talking to someone. Someone who apparently didn\u2019t take her warning seriously because Stephen\u2019s magic crackles around them before pushing away whoever got too close. That someone curses when they hit the floor and others in the room laugh at their misfortune.</p><p>Rhodey was the next to speak. \u201cThat\u2019s not Mom Mode Barton. Strange is in full-on Mama Bear Mode. Only Tones is getting close.\u201d</p><p>Peter felt Stephen\u2019s grumble before he heard it. \u201cPlease stop talking about me like I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I was just worried about the kid. You didn\u2019t need to throw me across the room!\u201d</p><p>The Avengers ignore him and go back to their separate activities, and Peter soon feels himself being extracted from his cocoon to which he whines pathetically. He was comfortable!</p><p>\u201cI know Underoos\u2026but I brought hot chocolate. Drink this then you can snuggle with Mama Bear all you want.\u201d</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t about to argue with that, so he accepts the mug of chocolate and slowly drinks the contents with Levi still wrapped around his shoulders. He ignores the concerned glances from their teammates because he was beginning to suspect that he passed out in front of them, and that was embarrassing. Not including the cuddle fest he had with Stephen, but that was something they were used to seeing.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter asks quietly and vaguely registers the sorcerer putting his shirt back on.</p><p>Tony and Stephen look at each other and the billionaire sighs. \u201cYou shaved about ten years of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think your spider DNA keeps you from thermoregulating.\u201d The sorcerer finally answers.</p><p>Tony snorts. \u201cYeah. So let\u2019s not have a repeat of today. If Happy isn\u2019t there, you call someone alright?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods numbly. \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d</p><p>He places his empty mug on the coffee table, his body pleasantly warm and fuzzy, and then practically falls back over onto Stephen and nuzzles his shoulder. Levi wiggles away and floats behind the couch as Tony replaces the cloak with a heavy blanket and then briefly moves the pair\u2019s feet to sit on the couch. He moves their feet back onto his lap, places his own on the coffee table, and then glances around at the full living room.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I bother giving you guys your own floors if you keep taking over mine?\u201d</p><p>Steve smiles but doesn\u2019t look up from his notepad. \u201cI\u2019m just up here for that snuggle burrito over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend you\u2019re drawing fluffy kittens if you give me a copy of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Soft snores draw the attention of every single person in the room and Tony had to cover his mouth to hide the fond smile that broke to the surface. The snores not only came from Peter, but also from Stephen whose cheek was resting on top of the teen\u2019s head. Brown curls were all that anyone could see since the blanket was pulled up to Peter\u2019s nose and the rest of his face was hidden in the sorcerer\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cStrange officially has his cub.\u201d Nat whispers affectionately.</p><p>Everyone, including Tony, chokes on their laughter.</p></p>",
