No reminders of her, no chances of bumping into her and no risk of seeing anyone she knew. The letters might be in her name, twice, but LA. was a Layla free zone.</p><!-- more --><p>For the past year, I&rsquo;d been playing out of sight, out of mind. I&rsquo;d had plenty to keep my self occupied: issues with Zayn, until he finally left, dealing with that fall out, touring, recording, and promotion. There hadn&rsquo;t been too much of a gap where I could wallow in what had happened, and I was thankful for that (even if it left me completely exhausted).</p><p>But now we were on an unlimited break, and we needed it. Five years was a long time to be performing nonstop, and I missed the constant distraction. Jeff, to his credit, was making me focus on the future. I was already setting plans in motion for a solo album, and I&rsquo;d even auditioned to be in a movie, to really take a step out of my comfort zone. It worked up to a point, but there were always moments where the smallest thing would make me think of her. I&rsquo;d be going over my lines for an audition, or I&rsquo;d be trying to write a song, and she&rsquo;d pop into my head. It would take so long to regain control of my thoughts, scolding myself for letting them wander, before I was wrangling them back into their box. She was the first person I wanted to tell things to when something good or bad happened. I&rsquo;d wanted nothing more than to speak to her when Zayn had left the band. Losing him reminded me of losing her, and all I wanted was to hear her tell me that everything was going to be fine.</p><p>I&rsquo;d made plans to return to England, to prepare for filming, and even though it was back home and not London, just being that close made the temptation to go see Layla too big. Maybe - I hoped - being in the place where I grew up, with my mum and Robin, with old school friends, and with the nervous excitement of attempting something I had never done before on my mind, it would help me forget her. Even if only for a little while.</p><p>Today was a good day though; I was going to meet Jeff and Glenne, have lunch and hang out, try and remember that I was technically on holiday so I didn&rsquo;t have to be on the go constantly. The glorious California sunshine made it easy to get out of bed and face the day, and being with two of my best friends made it even easier.</p><p>Parking the car outside the restaurant in which I was meeting them, I noticed a few paparazzi in the rearview mirror and sighed - they&rsquo;d probably followed me from home, or someone from the restaurant had guessed that if Jeff was going to be there, then so would I. Some days it felt like I wasn&rsquo;t on a break at all. If it wasn&rsquo;t the paps shoving their lenses in my face and asking about girlfriends, it was fans constantly asking for photos while I was just out trying to buy a smoothie.</p><p>Grabbing my phone from its holster on the dashboard, I opened the car door and stepped out to be met with a chorus of clicks and questions. I scowled at the cameras then looked down to see a series of messages from Gem.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br/><i>I probably shouldn&rsquo;t tell you this&hellip;</i><br/><i>I&rsquo;m at an event with Lou, and Layla&rsquo;s here</i></p><p>Had there not been anyone around me, I&rsquo;d have stopped dead and clutched my stomach. Just seeing Layla\u2019s name made it clench and lurch. Below the texts was a picture of Lou, her usual peace sign posed, and behind her hand was the woman who broke my heart. The sun, and my rushed footsteps, were making it difficult to see her properly, but I knew it was her, and I\u2019d never experienced such a feeling of almighty loss, mixed with a rush of overwhelming love and relief, at seeing her after so long. I\u2019d obviously taken too long to react since opening Gem\u2019s messages because another one came through.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br/><i>Shit! I shouldn&rsquo;t have said anything.</i></p><p>I walked into the restaurant, but instead of going to find my friends, I headed to the bathroom and locked myself in a cubicle. It was torture, but I wanted to study every detail of her picture. Layla&rsquo;s hair was shorter but still blonde, she was tucking a loose curl behind her ear and smiling to a red headed woman I recognised as Rose. The picture was grainy and pixelated so I turned up the brightness and zoomed in, wishing the photo would reveal more; was she happy? Was she seeing someone? Did she still hate me?</p><p><b>Harry</b><br/><i>What&rsquo;s she doing there?</i></p><p>My fingers shook as I typed, my rings making my movements so heavy and clumsy that I wanted to tear them off. Common sense told me to go meet my friends and to not let it affect me so much that \u00a0my sister, and closest friend, were in the same room as the person I desperately wanted to be but my feet were stuck. Thankfully, Gemma didn&rsquo;t make me wait too long for a reply.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br/><i>I think her and a friend organised the event. Should I have not told you? I didn\u2019t want to keep it from you. Are you OK?</i></p><p><b>Harry</b><br/><i>It&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;m just surprised. Have you spoken to her?</i></p><p>Closing my eyes, I leant my head against the wall and tried to breathe normally. Another message came through, but to my annoyance it was just \u00a0Jeff asking if he&rsquo;d imagined seeing me arrive. I quickly replied that I&rsquo;d be with them in a minute then sent a message to my sister. I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked if they\u2019d spoken, torn between wanting to find out everything about her life now, and worried Gemma would be horrible to her out of loyalty, so I was reluctant to wait for an answer. I&rsquo;d also spent months convincing mum and Gem that I was over Layla, that maybe they had been right about it just being infatuation, but that I was okay now. I probably should have just left it at my surprise.</p><p><b>Harry</b><br/><i>Don\u2019t speak to her, Gem, not unless she speaks to you first. Please.</i></p><p>Hitting send, I left the toilet cubicle and headed downstairs. I walked through the restaurant to find my friends, and I could hear some mutterings as I passed tables, my name being whispered excitedly behind menus and against the rims of glasses. But when I spotted Jeff and Glenne, I ignored the murmurs and readied my smile - the pang of jealousy I usually got from seeing them together was there, but it was normally fleeting. After Gem&rsquo;s messages, it was like a punch to the gut.</p><p>&ldquo;Hersh!&rdquo; Jeff grinned as soon as he spotted me approaching them, &ldquo;We were getting worried, man.&rdquo;</p><p>The couple rose from their chairs and greeted me like we hadn&rsquo;t seen each other in weeks, but in fact it had actually only been a day or two.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I needed to make a quick call. My sister,\u201d I explained as we took our seats, and Jeff handed me the menu he no doubt knew off by heart because I\u2019d kept them waiting so long.</p><p>&quot;Everything alright?&rdquo; Glenne asked, concerned, making me feel bad for the lie.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing serious,&rdquo; I answered, forcing a smile, &ldquo;have you guys ordered?&rdquo;</p><p>Once we\u2019d ordered food, my mind went quickly back to Gemma and why she still hadn\u2019t responded to my last message. I knew I was being quiet and distracted, but try as I might, my focus was stuck on that photo and what was happening over five thousand miles away.</p><p>After the third time of asking Jeff to repeat a question because I hadn&rsquo;t been listening, he threw his hands up and asked outright, &ldquo;Okay, that\u2019s it! What&rsquo;s going on? It&rsquo;s been like talking to a wall since you got here.&rdquo; He leant his elbows on the table and looked me in the eye, but I didn&rsquo;t have the chance to speak before he rolled his eyes, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Layla, right?&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed to have cottoned on to how I behaved when something related to her had upset me. He either knew me too well, or I did a much worse job at hiding it than I thought.</p><p>Jeff and Glenne knew all about my relationship with Layla, but they had been the biggest naysayers - along with mum and Gemma - and they\u2019d made no secret of being relieved when I had told them it was over for good. Just like mum had been, they\u2019d both been sympathetic, but were always quick to tell me that it was for the best. Jeff was a smart man, and he knew that the baggage Layla brought would affect my career at its most pivotal - I&rsquo;d started to finally escape the tabloid rumours of multiple girlfriends and older women, I would only undo all the hard work if suddenly I was found out to be in a relationship with a divorced woman in her thirties. That&rsquo;s how he saw it anyway, and while he wasn\u2019t exactly wrong, I should have handled the situation better than just impulsively jumping into bed with someone without talking to Layla first about my concerns. My friends and family had been against me being with Layla, but I\u2019d been the coward who had messed it up.</p><p>&ldquo;Gemma&rsquo;s at an event and\u2026 Layla&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p><p>Her name felt weird in my mouth, I thought it a hundred times a day, but I didn\u2019t dare ever say it aloud because it was usually met with looks of concern or annoyance. Picking my phone up off the table, I showed them the picture, more for my benefit than theirs - I just wanted to look at it again.</p><p>The couple exchanged a look, but Glenne spoke before Jeff had the chance, &ldquo;Do you really want to go down this road again?&rdquo; Realising how harsh her words had sounded, she looked me in the eye, and asked, softly, &ldquo;are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I feel numb, I think.&rdquo; I shrugged.</p><p>The truth was, I hadn&rsquo;t even left the said road, Layla was always on my mind from the moment I woke up. But the conversation was too heavy for the setting, and my emotions were too near the surface for me to really talk about how seeing her felt without running the risk of breaking down. Numb was the right word for now, but that barely covered how I truly felt; I wanted to weep, to shout, to punch a wall, and let my heart break all over again. Instead, I gave the picture one last glance and turned the phone over to lay the screen flat on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;H, you have so much to look forward to,\u201d Jeff spoke, his statement sounding like a matter of fact, \u201cyou need to forget her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, and I&rsquo;m trying.&rdquo;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t unsympathetic, neither of them were, but other than mum and Gemma, he was the only one who knew the full story. He&rsquo;d made me leave the house when I just wanted to lie in bed, he&rsquo;d sobered me up when I&rsquo;d escaped London to LA and had thought drowning my sorrows was a good idea, and he&rsquo;d continuously reminded me that I had to keep going, that wallowing in self-pity wasn\u2019t going to fix anything. He had already been wary of Layla - watching me fall to pieces, and having to repeatedly put me back together - so nobody suspected what I was going through, and it only made him dislike her more. I imagined that after our holiday in St. Barts, and my rekindling a relationship with Kendall, he had hoped that maybe I truly was back on track again. I also imagined that he was now expecting a major setback.</p><p>I let out a loud sigh, sitting back in my chair and running my fingers through my long hair which would soon be cropped short. &ldquo;This is just a setback, and a bit of shock. I&rsquo;m also worried why Gem hasn&rsquo;t replied to my last message.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re brawling!&rdquo; Jeff laughed, then when he saw my eyes widen in panic, he quickly added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m joking, H.&rdquo;</p><p>Logically, I knew Jeff&rsquo;s comment was a flippant joke, but Gemma&rsquo;s radio silence was making me nervous, and it had me picturing Lou and Rose tearing the girls apart as they kicked and punched and screamed hateful words at each other. My sister was still furious with Layla - so much so that I could almost see the steam shooting from her ears whenever the subject was brought up - so I couldn&rsquo;t entirely write off the possibility of a punch up. My sister, while fairly mild mannered, could have a vicious and barbed tongue when pushed, so I knew she would be fine. But Layla, after years of being scared to say how she felt because of Will shutting her down any time she opened her mouth, had me worried for her. Gemma was not unkind, but she was one of my biggest and fiercest protectors, and all she could see was that Layla broke my heart.</p><p>&ldquo;It\u2019s no good, I need to call her.&rdquo; Getting up suddenly, I saw the look of worry on my friends\u2019 faces - one I thankfully hadn&rsquo;t seen for a few months - and clarified, &ldquo;Gemma, I&rsquo;m calling Gemma. I&rsquo;ll be quick, I promise, you guys order dessert and I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p><p>It did little to placate them; Jeff shrugged a shoulder at his future wife because there was nothing he could to to stop me. They were concerned and frustrated that I was so hung up on this woman, but they at least loved me enough to let me get over it at my own pace and always be there \u00a0when they had to pick up the pieces.</p><p>Near the doors, I grabbed a passing waiter and asked him if there was somewhere private I could go to make a call. With the paps outside, and other diners looking like they were building up the courage to approach me and ask for photos, I needed to be alone without any interruptions. I would play the celebrity once I knew two of the people I loved the most weren\u2019t tearing each other\u2019s hair out. The waiter led me into a private dining room and quickly left me alone, but the phone was against my ear and ringing before he&rsquo;d even closed the door. To my annoyance - but not to my surprise - the first few attempts rang and rang then went to voicemail. So, I decided to try the other person I knew who was at the party and thankfully she picked up almost instantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Gemma with you?&rdquo; I asked, skipping over the weak greeting Lou gave.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; I could hear music and chatting in the background while she stalled, and I stupidly even tried to see if I could pick out Layla&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;&hellip;no, she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lou, where&rsquo;s my sister?&rdquo; My patience already wearing thin, anger started to bubble at the thought that despite how long we&rsquo;d been friends, she would consider lying to me.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip; fine! She\u2019s talking to Layla.&rdquo; Defeated, she sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo; I knew that it was a good sign that Lou was on the phone to me and not breaking up a fight, but her distracted replied indicated that she was waiting for something to happen that meant she might have to step in. \u201cLou! What are they doing?\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Haz, calm down, they&rsquo;re just talking,&rdquo; Lou said, attempting to soothe me, but the panic was in full flow, and I was past the point of calming down. Steadying myself against the table in front of me, I wished I could go there and see Lil, and stop Gemma from lashing out.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, you have to get her to call me as soon as she&rsquo;s done&rdquo;. Pleading, I fought back asking her to get them away from each other, knowing that her intervening would look even more like an attack on Layla. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, of course, I&rsquo;ll tell her.&rdquo; She sighed again, but this time it was more like Jeff&rsquo;s shrug, accepting that there was no point in trying to reason with me until I spoke to my sister.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2d4a738cbd5ab117a38033b5a5a50fc/tumblr_inline_pj61rrgRa51w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"/></figure><p><b>Gemma</b></p><p>It had taken a moment for me to click who she was; her hair was shorter and blonder, and she was taller because of her high-heels, but the most noticeably different thing, which made her almost completely unrecognisable, was that she looked happy.</p><p>The night we\u2019d met in Harry&rsquo;s kitchen, she&rsquo;d been drinking, and I could tell she&rsquo;d been crying; her eyes were a little puffy and red, and she had an aura of unbelievable sadness around her. Layla, that night, had been quiet, demure, and a little standoffish - not at all what I expected from the woman who had Harry so besotted. But this Layla who was rushing around, making passing jokes with her friend, and greeting everyone with a warm and genuine smile, I could understand his attraction to her more.</p><p>Mum and I had spent months worrying about Harry and how much he\u2019d been broken by the end of the relationship. At first, we put it all down to infatuation, and the age old adage \u2018you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got \u2018til it\u2019s gone\u2019, but we quickly went from telling him he had nobody to blame but himself for cheating on her, to being furious with Layla for causing him so much pain. I didn\u2019t hate her for finishing her relationship with my brother - that had actually been a huge relief for all of us - but I hated how she did it. It felt so cold and callous. It made Harry question if he ever loved her, and made it impossible to reassure him that she had, because her actions seemed to show that it was easy for her to cut him out of her life completely. From the start, we\u2019d been worried he would end up brokenhearted and pining for a woman who was old enough to know better, so when exactly that happened, it made us all angry with her. Just seeing her at the party, smiling like she didn\u2019t have a care in the world, made my blood boil. I wanted to cause a scene and tell her exactly what I thought of her.</p><p>What stopped me from giving her a public dressing down, was Harry\u2019s response to my momentary lapse of reason in telling him I was with her. He tried to sound unbothered, but the panic and desperation to know more radiated from his messages. I wanted to speak to her, to give her a piece of my mind, but I vowed to myself and Lou that I wouldn\u2019t make a scene.</p><p>When I finally calmed myself, and approached Layla, she was talking to her friend at the bar. They both looked surprised to see me come over, but while Layla&rsquo;s face changed to worry, the friend looked ready - despite how pretty and angelic she seemed - to fight to the death if I was there to cause an argument. The redhead backed down when Layla touched her arm and greeted me warmly, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was out of professionalism or because she knew it would probably get back to Harry.</p><p>The two of us exchanged greetings then fell silent. I wanted to tear her to shreds, but the cold, blue-eyed glower from her friend had its desired effect by keeping me quiet, so it was Layla who spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;Gemma, this is my friend and business partner, Rose. Rose, this is Harry&rsquo;s sister, Gemma,\u201d she said, with a warning glance at her friend.</p><p>In a three-sixty change, Rose smiled at me genuinely and spoke with a thick London accent that sounded strange coming from someone who looked so&hellip; otherworldly, &quot;it&rsquo;s so nice to meet you, Gemma, are you enjoying the party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you too, and I am, thank you! Are you two the planners?&rdquo; I asked, glancing at Layla, who was looking at me with a strange expression on her face. I wanted to defensively ask what she was staring at but she spoke before I had the chance.</p><p>&ldquo;We are! It&rsquo;s only our third event, but other than a tube strike making a few of our servers late, there hasn&rsquo;t been any drama so far!&rdquo;</p><p>The three of us forced a laugh, and I caught the not-so-subtle hint that she hoped I wasn&rsquo;t going to be the one to cause any drama. Once again, I caught her peering closely at me, and it dawned on me that maybe she was was looking for a resemblance between me and Harry. To the untrained eye, there wasn\u2019t much of one, but from the way she cast her gaze down, and pretended to look at her hot pink clipboard, I could tell she\u2019d found it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a second to chat?&rdquo; I asked, suddenly feeling nervous. I\u2019d gone over with all guns blazing, having every intention of calmly making sure she knew what she&rsquo;d done, but the two friends&rsquo; being so genuinely welcoming had caught me completely off guard. Now, I not only wanted to tell her how much she&rsquo;d broken Harry&rsquo;s heart, but I also wanted her to help me understand why.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Smiling and placing the clipboard she&rsquo;d held onto the bar, she turned to me and gave me her full attention.</p><p>Without having to be asked, Rose took her cue and excused herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the headset if you need me,&rdquo; she reminded Layla, tapping her ear before shooting me a look that I imagined would put the fear of God into many people stronger than I. It felt like a threat when she said to me, &ldquo;enjoy your evening, Gemma, let us know if you need anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pussy-cat, really,&rdquo; Layla grinned as she watched her friend walk away from us. She then turned to look me dead in the eye, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if you would want to talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Nodding, and answering honestly, I admitted, &ldquo;I nearly didn&rsquo;t, and&hellip;&rdquo; she cocked her head to one side, and I decided that mentioning Harry knew she was at the party with me was not a good idea, not yet, &ldquo;&hellip;but, I felt we should at least say hello and address the elephant in the room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I appreciate that, thank you.&rdquo; She relaxed a little, and became a little less on the defensive, more open to what I had to say. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>The question took me so by surprise that had she slapped me around the face I\u2019d have been less shocked. There was no gentle build up, she just asked outright what she wanted to know. Looking her over, I considered my reply, and the intent of her asking how he was. Her face was impassive, but there was a flash of something in her eyes that was gone before I could be certain what it was.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s really good! He\u2019s really, really happy!&rdquo; Layla, the woman who was throwing me off at every turn, did it once more by giving a wide, genuine smile of relief, like she&rsquo;d genuinely been worried he might not be. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s enjoying his time off.&rdquo;</p><p>Placing both hands on her heart, she chuckled, \u201cI don\u2019t think you realise how good that is to hear. I\u2019m- I\u2019m really glad he\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not long come back from his New Year\u2019s holiday in St. Bart\u2019s with his girlfriend, Kendall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Has he? Uh&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>This time, I caught the fleeting moment where she reacted exactly how I expected her to - her face fell, and she looked like she was about to cry or throw-up - but it was brief. Quickly, she was back to being happy that Harry had moved on, forcing a smile, determined not to show me that being told about Harry&rsquo;s holiday romance had affected her. I felt it unnecessary to tell her that he wasn\u2019t actually with Kendall anymore.</p><p>&quot;Well, I&rsquo;m just glad he&rsquo;s happy!\u201d She said. \u201cThat&rsquo;s really all I ever wanted, believe it or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is happy,&rdquo; I replied, still unsure if I did in fact believe it. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Layla paused, and the petty part of me was pleased that this time it was me who had taken her by surprise. Looking at me sceptically, I saw her try to work out if the question was a trap, and if she told me she was, I would tell her she didn\u2019t deserve happiness after what she did.</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Smiling coyly, and probably hoping that wasn&rsquo;t the wrong thing to say, she continued, &ldquo;we\u2019re just getting things off the ground with the business so I&rsquo;m working like crazy, and\u2026 like Harry, I&rsquo;m even dating a little. Nothing serious, I don\u2019t feel ready for that yet.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, she was distracted, looking off to the other side of the bar and putting a finger to her ear to hear what was being said in her headset. Feeling my phone vibrating in my bag, I pulled it out, and wasn\u2019t surprised to see the picture of Harry I\u2019d taken the Christmas just gone, which signalled his call. I let it go to voicemail, crammed the phone back into my clutch, and hoped Layla hadn\u2019t seen it, but when I looked up, she was watching me with amusement for trying to hide the evidence.</p><p>\u201cYou told him I\u2019m here then?\u201d Layla asked, calmly.</p><p>Sighing, I nodded and shrugged, \u201cI did. But he\u2019s in LA, or I probably wouldn\u2019t have. I think you know why.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and shook her head, \u201cOdd to think that the one thing we can agree on is that we don\u2019t want Harry in the same room as me. Although, I suspect it\u2019s for very different reasons.\u201d</p><p>Once again, she became distracted, but this time there was nobody talking in her ear. She frowned and chewed her bottom lip, staring at where I\u2019d just hidden my phone as she seemed to debate \u00a0over something in her head.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes lifted to meet mine and she let her wall down. Leaning in close to me, Layla asked with a need that completely changed my opinion of her, \u201cplease, Gemma, is he really okay? I just want to know that he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. She was close to tears, her bottom lip wobbling before she caught it between her teeth, and I could sense that it had been a long time since she\u2019d allowed herself to let thoughts of Harry get to her. I\u2019d come to talk to her because I wanted to hurt her emotionally, I\u2019d wanted her to know that me, and all the other people who\u2019d helped Harry put himself back together, would never forget what she had done. But I didn\u2019t want to do that anymore. Layla was torturing herself enough over it, and she didn\u2019t need me to tell her how much Harry was hurting, she already knew it because she was going through exactly the same amount of pain.</p><p>Finding myself reaching out and touching her arm, I looked her in the eyes and said, with as much conviction as I could muster, &ldquo;He really is, Layla. He wasn&rsquo;t for a while, and that made me furious with you, but\u2026 but you did the right thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes, I question that.&rdquo; Tears spilled onto her cheeks as she scoffed, and she carefully wiped them away with the tips of her fingers. &ldquo;I miss him a lot, Gemma, I really do. I miss him so much sometimes that it physically hurts, but I needed to get my life together. We were becoming so toxic that I would never have been able to fix all the other things that were broken while I was worrying that he wanted someone else, or that he was unhappy being with me. I know that you hated me, and you all probably hate me even more now, but I want you to know that I did love him. I still do. But&hellip;&rdquo; She shrugged sadly, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t keep having my heart broken.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, I nodded and looked over to where Lou was standing, seeing her just as she ended a call with a worried grimace. Harry had obviously tried calling her after I\u2019d ignored him, and I could only imagine how frantic with worry he was that Layla and I were tearing each other&rsquo;s hair out. I let out a sigh, and turned my focus back to Layla. She\u2019d regained her composure, and was holding her clipboard tightly to her chest like armour, waiting for my response.</p><p>\u201cWe never hated you, Layla, we were just worried for Harry.\u201d I chuckled, hoping to keep the conversation positive, \u201cSee! That\u2019s another thing we can agree on - we both just want what\u2019s best for Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d exhaling, she forced a watery smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad we spoke, and I\u2019m really happy that Harry\u2019s moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we did too, and it saves any awkwardness for any future run-ins,\u201d we both laughed, and I almost saw the wall go back up and her turn back into the friendly, professional person I\u2019d first approached. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to work, or Rose will probably shout at me.\u201d</p><p>Layla laughed again - cheeks dimpling, not unlike Harry&rsquo;s - and nodded in agreement, and we looked over to where Rose was stood, watching us closely. I was about to say goodbye and walk away, when she blurted out, \u201cThis is totally your call but, tell him I said hello.\u201d</p><p>We both knew there was slim chance of me passing on her regards, but I told her I would, and that seemed to make her happy. We said goodbye, and I headed back over to Lou who grimaced as I got close.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry wants you to call him.\u201d Handing me a cocktail, which I drank down in two gulps, she quickly added, &quot;and I&rsquo;m sorry, but he knows you were talking to her. How did it go? It seemed like it went well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really, really expected to hate her, and I thought she\u2019d be totally uncaring about him, but she\u2026 she really loves him. This whole time, I was convinced she\u2019d broken his heart, but he broke hers too.&rdquo; I looked around the room, at the event Layla and Rose had put together impeccably. I could see them talking to the woman whose product launch it was, and again, I barely recognised Layla as the red-eyed woman who&rsquo;d been in Harry&rsquo;s kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to say to Haz?&rdquo; Lou asked, forcing me to face that I would eventually have to call him and give him some version of our conversation. \u201cDo you think this is going to make things bad again?\u201d</p><p>Digging my phone out of my bag, I saw three missed calls from Harry. I regretted telling him I was at the same party as Layla, and I wished I knew for certain what would make it all easier for him. As it was, I could only hope I was doing the right thing by letting them both think that the other was doing just fine.</p><p>Signalling for Lou to follow me out, so I could call my brother, I made a decision, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him that she\u2019s happy, and that she\u2019s moving on. That\u2019s what I told her he was doing, and that seemed to make her happy. I just hope that it does the same for him.&ldquo;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e841586a479005e79589123ddc55960b/tumblr_inline_pj61sx2vpZ1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"/></figure><p><b>Harry</b></p><p>Ending the call, I drove to Jeff&rsquo;s calmly while I processed what Gemma had told me. I turned the radio up loud to keep the barrage of conflicting thoughts at bay, but as I pulled up to the house and parked, my chest tightened, and I felt the horrible realisation creep up on me that Layla and I were truly over.</p><p>I&rsquo;d been holding on to the idea that somehow we&rsquo;d get back together, a secret hope, which made each day apart that little bit more bearable. But Gemma had told me that Layla was happy without me, she was running her own business, and what killed me the most, even dating someone. Putting my head on the steering wheel, I let the pain engulf me, a fresh new wound opening because Layla no longer needed me like I needed her. I&rsquo;d enjoyed being her strength, being the positive in her life when Will had treated her so badly, but she didn&rsquo;t need to rely on me for that anymore. My fuck up had made certain that I was a positive that had become a big, fat negative, and for that, I was left behind, not knowing how to move forward.</p>",

No reminders of her, no chances of bumping into her and no risk of seeing anyone she knew. The letters might be in her name, twice, but LA. was a Layla free zone.</p>[[MORE]]<p>For the past year, I\u2019d been playing out of sight, out of mind. I\u2019d had plenty to keep my self occupied: issues with Zayn, until he finally left, dealing with that fall out, touring, recording, and promotion. There hadn\u2019t been too much of a gap where I could wallow in what had happened, and I was thankful for that (even if it left me completely exhausted).</p><p>But now we were on an unlimited break, and we needed it. Five years was a long time to be performing nonstop, and I missed the constant distraction. Jeff, to his credit, was making me focus on the future. I was already setting plans in motion for a solo album, and I\u2019d even auditioned to be in a movie, to really take a step out of my comfort zone. It worked up to a point, but there were always moments where the smallest thing would make me think of her. I\u2019d be going over my lines for an audition, or I\u2019d be trying to write a song, and she\u2019d pop into my head. It would take so long to regain control of my thoughts, scolding myself for letting them wander, before I was wrangling them back into their box. She was the first person I wanted to tell things to when something good or bad happened. I\u2019d wanted nothing more than to speak to her when Zayn had left the band. Losing him reminded me of losing her, and all I wanted was to hear her tell me that everything was going to be fine.</p><p>I\u2019d made plans to return to England, to prepare for filming, and even though it was back home and not London, just being that close made the temptation to go see Layla too big. Maybe - I hoped - being in the place where I grew up, with my mum and Robin, with old school friends, and with the nervous excitement of attempting something I had never done before on my mind, it would help me forget her. Even if only for a little while.</p><p>Today was a good day though; I was going to meet Jeff and Glenne, have lunch and hang out, try and remember that I was technically on holiday so I didn\u2019t have to be on the go constantly. The glorious California sunshine made it easy to get out of bed and face the day, and being with two of my best friends made it even easier.</p><p>Parking the car outside the restaurant in which I was meeting them, I noticed a few paparazzi in the rearview mirror and sighed - they\u2019d probably followed me from home, or someone from the restaurant had guessed that if Jeff was going to be there, then so would I. Some days it felt like I wasn\u2019t on a break at all. If it wasn\u2019t the paps shoving their lenses in my face and asking about girlfriends, it was fans constantly asking for photos while I was just out trying to buy a smoothie.</p><p>Grabbing my phone from its holster on the dashboard, I opened the car door and stepped out to be met with a chorus of clicks and questions. I scowled at the cameras then looked down to see a series of messages from Gem.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br><i>I probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this\u2026</i><br><i>I\u2019m at an event with Lou, and Layla\u2019s here</i></p><p>Had there not been anyone around me, I\u2019d have stopped dead and clutched my stomach. Just seeing Layla\u2019s name made it clench and lurch. Below the texts was a picture of Lou, her usual peace sign posed, and behind her hand was the woman who broke my heart. The sun, and my rushed footsteps, were making it difficult to see her properly, but I knew it was her, and I\u2019d never experienced such a feeling of almighty loss, mixed with a rush of overwhelming love and relief, at seeing her after so long. I\u2019d obviously taken too long to react since opening Gem\u2019s messages because another one came through.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br><i>Shit! I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.</i></p><p>I walked into the restaurant, but instead of going to find my friends, I headed to the bathroom and locked myself in a cubicle. It was torture, but I wanted to study every detail of her picture. Layla\u2019s hair was shorter but still blonde, she was tucking a loose curl behind her ear and smiling to a red headed woman I recognised as Rose. The picture was grainy and pixelated so I turned up the brightness and zoomed in, wishing the photo would reveal more; was she happy? Was she seeing someone? Did she still hate me?</p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>What\u2019s she doing there?</i></p><p>My fingers shook as I typed, my rings making my movements so heavy and clumsy that I wanted to tear them off. Common sense told me to go meet my friends and to not let it affect me so much that \u00a0my sister, and closest friend, were in the same room as the person I desperately wanted to be but my feet were stuck. Thankfully, Gemma didn\u2019t make me wait too long for a reply.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br><i>I think her and a friend organised the event. Should I have not told you? I didn\u2019t want to keep it from you. Are you OK?</i></p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>It\u2019s fine, I\u2019m just surprised. Have you spoken to her?</i></p><p>Closing my eyes, I leant my head against the wall and tried to breathe normally. Another message came through, but to my annoyance it was just \u00a0Jeff asking if he\u2019d imagined seeing me arrive. I quickly replied that I\u2019d be with them in a minute then sent a message to my sister. I shouldn\u2019t have asked if they\u2019d spoken, torn between wanting to find out everything about her life now, and worried Gemma would be horrible to her out of loyalty, so I was reluctant to wait for an answer. I\u2019d also spent months convincing mum and Gem that I was over Layla, that maybe they had been right about it just being infatuation, but that I was okay now. I probably should have just left it at my surprise.</p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>Don\u2019t speak to her, Gem, not unless she speaks to you first. Please.</i></p><p>Hitting send, I left the toilet cubicle and headed downstairs. I walked through the restaurant to find my friends, and I could hear some mutterings as I passed tables, my name being whispered excitedly behind menus and against the rims of glasses. But when I spotted Jeff and Glenne, I ignored the murmurs and readied my smile - the pang of jealousy I usually got from seeing them together was there, but it was normally fleeting. After Gem\u2019s messages, it was like a punch to the gut.</p><p>\u201cHersh!\u201d Jeff grinned as soon as he spotted me approaching them, \u201cWe were getting worried, man.\u201d</p><p>The couple rose from their chairs and greeted me like we hadn\u2019t seen each other in weeks, but in fact it had actually only been a day or two.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I needed to make a quick call. My sister,\u201d I explained as we took our seats, and Jeff handed me the menu he no doubt knew off by heart because I\u2019d kept them waiting so long.</p><p>\"Everything alright?\u201d Glenne asked, concerned, making me feel bad for the lie.</p><p>\u201cNothing serious,\u201d I answered, forcing a smile, \u201chave you guys ordered?\u201d</p><p>Once we\u2019d ordered food, my mind went quickly back to Gemma and why she still hadn\u2019t responded to my last message. I knew I was being quiet and distracted, but try as I might, my focus was stuck on that photo and what was happening over five thousand miles away.</p><p>After the third time of asking Jeff to repeat a question because I hadn\u2019t been listening, he threw his hands up and asked outright, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it! What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s been like talking to a wall since you got here.\u201d He leant his elbows on the table and looked me in the eye, but I didn\u2019t have the chance to speak before he rolled his eyes, \u201cit\u2019s Layla, right?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to have cottoned on to how I behaved when something related to her had upset me. He either knew me too well, or I did a much worse job at hiding it than I thought.</p><p>Jeff and Glenne knew all about my relationship with Layla, but they had been the biggest naysayers - along with mum and Gemma - and they\u2019d made no secret of being relieved when I had told them it was over for good. Just like mum had been, they\u2019d both been sympathetic, but were always quick to tell me that it was for the best. Jeff was a smart man, and he knew that the baggage Layla brought would affect my career at its most pivotal - I\u2019d started to finally escape the tabloid rumours of multiple girlfriends and older women, I would only undo all the hard work if suddenly I was found out to be in a relationship with a divorced woman in her thirties. That\u2019s how he saw it anyway, and while he wasn\u2019t exactly wrong, I should have handled the situation better than just impulsively jumping into bed with someone without talking to Layla first about my concerns. My friends and family had been against me being with Layla, but I\u2019d been the coward who had messed it up.</p><p>\u201cGemma\u2019s at an event and\u2026 Layla\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Her name felt weird in my mouth, I thought it a hundred times a day, but I didn\u2019t dare ever say it aloud because it was usually met with looks of concern or annoyance. Picking my phone up off the table, I showed them the picture, more for my benefit than theirs - I just wanted to look at it again.</p><p>The couple exchanged a look, but Glenne spoke before Jeff had the chance, \u201cDo you really want to go down this road again?\u201d Realising how harsh her words had sounded, she looked me in the eye, and asked, softly, \u201care you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel numb, I think.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>The truth was, I hadn\u2019t even left the said road, Layla was always on my mind from the moment I woke up. But the conversation was too heavy for the setting, and my emotions were too near the surface for me to really talk about how seeing her felt without running the risk of breaking down. Numb was the right word for now, but that barely covered how I truly felt; I wanted to weep, to shout, to punch a wall, and let my heart break all over again. Instead, I gave the picture one last glance and turned the phone over to lay the screen flat on the table.</p><p>\u201cH, you have so much to look forward to,\u201d Jeff spoke, his statement sounding like a matter of fact, \u201cyou need to forget her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t unsympathetic, neither of them were, but other than mum and Gemma, he was the only one who knew the full story. He\u2019d made me leave the house when I just wanted to lie in bed, he\u2019d sobered me up when I\u2019d escaped London to LA and had thought drowning my sorrows was a good idea, and he\u2019d continuously reminded me that I had to keep going, that wallowing in self-pity wasn\u2019t going to fix anything. He had already been wary of Layla - watching me fall to pieces, and having to repeatedly put me back together - so nobody suspected what I was going through, and it only made him dislike her more. I imagined that after our holiday in St. Barts, and my rekindling a relationship with Kendall, he had hoped that maybe I truly was back on track again. I also imagined that he was now expecting a major setback.</p><p>I let out a loud sigh, sitting back in my chair and running my fingers through my long hair which would soon be cropped short. \u201cThis is just a setback, and a bit of shock. I\u2019m also worried why Gem hasn\u2019t replied to my last message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re brawling!\u201d Jeff laughed, then when he saw my eyes widen in panic, he quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m joking, H.\u201d</p><p>Logically, I knew Jeff\u2019s comment was a flippant joke, but Gemma\u2019s radio silence was making me nervous, and it had me picturing Lou and Rose tearing the girls apart as they kicked and punched and screamed hateful words at each other. My sister was still furious with Layla - so much so that I could almost see the steam shooting from her ears whenever the subject was brought up - so I couldn\u2019t entirely write off the possibility of a punch up. My sister, while fairly mild mannered, could have a vicious and barbed tongue when pushed, so I knew she would be fine. But Layla, after years of being scared to say how she felt because of Will shutting her down any time she opened her mouth, had me worried for her. Gemma was not unkind, but she was one of my biggest and fiercest protectors, and all she could see was that Layla broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no good, I need to call her.\u201d Getting up suddenly, I saw the look of worry on my friends\u2019 faces - one I thankfully hadn\u2019t seen for a few months - and clarified, \u201cGemma, I\u2019m calling Gemma. I\u2019ll be quick, I promise, you guys order dessert and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>It did little to placate them; Jeff shrugged a shoulder at his future wife because there was nothing he could to to stop me. They were concerned and frustrated that I was so hung up on this woman, but they at least loved me enough to let me get over it at my own pace and always be there \u00a0when they had to pick up the pieces.</p><p>Near the doors, I grabbed a passing waiter and asked him if there was somewhere private I could go to make a call. With the paps outside, and other diners looking like they were building up the courage to approach me and ask for photos, I needed to be alone without any interruptions. I would play the celebrity once I knew two of the people I loved the most weren\u2019t tearing each other\u2019s hair out. The waiter led me into a private dining room and quickly left me alone, but the phone was against my ear and ringing before he\u2019d even closed the door. To my annoyance - but not to my surprise - the first few attempts rang and rang then went to voicemail. So, I decided to try the other person I knew who was at the party and thankfully she picked up almost instantly.</p><p>\u201cIs Gemma with you?\u201d I asked, skipping over the weak greeting Lou gave.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d I could hear music and chatting in the background while she stalled, and I stupidly even tried to see if I could pick out Layla\u2019s voice, \u201c\u2026no, she isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLou, where\u2019s my sister?\u201d My patience already wearing thin, anger started to bubble at the thought that despite how long we\u2019d been friends, she would consider lying to me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 fine! She\u2019s talking to Layla.\u201d Defeated, she sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d I knew that it was a good sign that Lou was on the phone to me and not breaking up a fight, but her distracted replied indicated that she was waiting for something to happen that meant she might have to step in. \u201cLou! What are they doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaz, calm down, they\u2019re just talking,\u201d Lou said, attempting to soothe me, but the panic was in full flow, and I was past the point of calming down. Steadying myself against the table in front of me, I wished I could go there and see Lil, and stop Gemma from lashing out.</p><p>\u201cPlease, you have to get her to call me as soon as she\u2019s done\u201d. Pleading, I fought back asking her to get them away from each other, knowing that her intervening would look even more like an attack on Layla. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, of course, I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d She sighed again, but this time it was more like Jeff\u2019s shrug, accepting that there was no point in trying to reason with me until I spoke to my sister.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2d4a738cbd5ab117a38033b5a5a50fc/tumblr_inline_pj61rrgRa51w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>Gemma</b></p><p>It had taken a moment for me to click who she was; her hair was shorter and blonder, and she was taller because of her high-heels, but the most noticeably different thing, which made her almost completely unrecognisable, was that she looked happy.</p><p>The night we\u2019d met in Harry\u2019s kitchen, she\u2019d been drinking, and I could tell she\u2019d been crying; her eyes were a little puffy and red, and she had an aura of unbelievable sadness around her. Layla, that night, had been quiet, demure, and a little standoffish - not at all what I expected from the woman who had Harry so besotted. But this Layla who was rushing around, making passing jokes with her friend, and greeting everyone with a warm and genuine smile, I could understand his attraction to her more.</p><p>Mum and I had spent months worrying about Harry and how much he\u2019d been broken by the end of the relationship. At first, we put it all down to infatuation, and the age old adage \u2018you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got \u2018til it\u2019s gone\u2019, but we quickly went from telling him he had nobody to blame but himself for cheating on her, to being furious with Layla for causing him so much pain. I didn\u2019t hate her for finishing her relationship with my brother - that had actually been a huge relief for all of us - but I hated how she did it. It felt so cold and callous. It made Harry question if he ever loved her, and made it impossible to reassure him that she had, because her actions seemed to show that it was easy for her to cut him out of her life completely. From the start, we\u2019d been worried he would end up brokenhearted and pining for a woman who was old enough to know better, so when exactly that happened, it made us all angry with her. Just seeing her at the party, smiling like she didn\u2019t have a care in the world, made my blood boil. I wanted to cause a scene and tell her exactly what I thought of her.</p><p>What stopped me from giving her a public dressing down, was Harry\u2019s response to my momentary lapse of reason in telling him I was with her. He tried to sound unbothered, but the panic and desperation to know more radiated from his messages. I wanted to speak to her, to give her a piece of my mind, but I vowed to myself and Lou that I wouldn\u2019t make a scene.</p><p>When I finally calmed myself, and approached Layla, she was talking to her friend at the bar. They both looked surprised to see me come over, but while Layla\u2019s face changed to worry, the friend looked ready - despite how pretty and angelic she seemed - to fight to the death if I was there to cause an argument. The redhead backed down when Layla touched her arm and greeted me warmly, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it was out of professionalism or because she knew it would probably get back to Harry.</p><p>The two of us exchanged greetings then fell silent. I wanted to tear her to shreds, but the cold, blue-eyed glower from her friend had its desired effect by keeping me quiet, so it was Layla who spoke again.</p><p>\u201cGemma, this is my friend and business partner, Rose. Rose, this is Harry\u2019s sister, Gemma,\u201d she said, with a warning glance at her friend.</p><p>In a three-sixty change, Rose smiled at me genuinely and spoke with a thick London accent that sounded strange coming from someone who looked so\u2026 otherworldly, \"it\u2019s so nice to meet you, Gemma, are you enjoying the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too, and I am, thank you! Are you two the planners?\u201d I asked, glancing at Layla, who was looking at me with a strange expression on her face. I wanted to defensively ask what she was staring at but she spoke before I had the chance.</p><p>\u201cWe are! It\u2019s only our third event, but other than a tube strike making a few of our servers late, there hasn\u2019t been any drama so far!\u201d</p><p>The three of us forced a laugh, and I caught the not-so-subtle hint that she hoped I wasn\u2019t going to be the one to cause any drama. Once again, I caught her peering closely at me, and it dawned on me that maybe she was was looking for a resemblance between me and Harry. To the untrained eye, there wasn\u2019t much of one, but from the way she cast her gaze down, and pretended to look at her hot pink clipboard, I could tell she\u2019d found it.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a second to chat?\u201d I asked, suddenly feeling nervous. I\u2019d gone over with all guns blazing, having every intention of calmly making sure she knew what she\u2019d done, but the two friends\u2019 being so genuinely welcoming had caught me completely off guard. Now, I not only wanted to tell her how much she\u2019d broken Harry\u2019s heart, but I also wanted her to help me understand why.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Smiling and placing the clipboard she\u2019d held onto the bar, she turned to me and gave me her full attention.</p><p>Without having to be asked, Rose took her cue and excused herself. \u201cI\u2019m on the headset if you need me,\u201d she reminded Layla, tapping her ear before shooting me a look that I imagined would put the fear of God into many people stronger than I. It felt like a threat when she said to me, \u201cenjoy your evening, Gemma, let us know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pussy-cat, really,\u201d Layla grinned as she watched her friend walk away from us. She then turned to look me dead in the eye, \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you would want to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, and answering honestly, I admitted, \u201cI nearly didn\u2019t, and\u2026\u201d she cocked her head to one side, and I decided that mentioning Harry knew she was at the party with me was not a good idea, not yet, \u201c\u2026but, I felt we should at least say hello and address the elephant in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciate that, thank you.\u201d She relaxed a little, and became a little less on the defensive, more open to what I had to say. \u201cHow\u2019s Harry?\u201d</p><p>The question took me so by surprise that had she slapped me around the face I\u2019d have been less shocked. There was no gentle build up, she just asked outright what she wanted to know. Looking her over, I considered my reply, and the intent of her asking how he was. Her face was impassive, but there was a flash of something in her eyes that was gone before I could be certain what it was.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really good! He\u2019s really, really happy!\u201d Layla, the woman who was throwing me off at every turn, did it once more by giving a wide, genuine smile of relief, like she\u2019d genuinely been worried he might not be. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying his time off.\u201d</p><p>Placing both hands on her heart, she chuckled, \u201cI don\u2019t think you realise how good that is to hear. I\u2019m- I\u2019m really glad he\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not long come back from his New Year\u2019s holiday in St. Bart\u2019s with his girlfriend, Kendall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Has he? Uh\u2026\u201c</p><p>This time, I caught the fleeting moment where she reacted exactly how I expected her to - her face fell, and she looked like she was about to cry or throw-up - but it was brief. Quickly, she was back to being happy that Harry had moved on, forcing a smile, determined not to show me that being told about Harry\u2019s holiday romance had affected her. I felt it unnecessary to tell her that he wasn\u2019t actually with Kendall anymore.</p><p>\"Well, I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s happy!\u201d She said. \u201cThat\u2019s really all I ever wanted, believe it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is happy,\u201d I replied, still unsure if I did in fact believe it. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Layla paused, and the petty part of me was pleased that this time it was me who had taken her by surprise. Looking at me sceptically, I saw her try to work out if the question was a trap, and if she told me she was, I would tell her she didn\u2019t deserve happiness after what she did.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Smiling coyly, and probably hoping that wasn\u2019t the wrong thing to say, she continued, \u201cwe\u2019re just getting things off the ground with the business so I\u2019m working like crazy, and\u2026 like Harry, I\u2019m even dating a little. Nothing serious, I don\u2019t feel ready for that yet.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she was distracted, looking off to the other side of the bar and putting a finger to her ear to hear what was being said in her headset. Feeling my phone vibrating in my bag, I pulled it out, and wasn\u2019t surprised to see the picture of Harry I\u2019d taken the Christmas just gone, which signalled his call. I let it go to voicemail, crammed the phone back into my clutch, and hoped Layla hadn\u2019t seen it, but when I looked up, she was watching me with amusement for trying to hide the evidence.</p><p>\u201cYou told him I\u2019m here then?\u201d Layla asked, calmly.</p><p>Sighing, I nodded and shrugged, \u201cI did. But he\u2019s in LA, or I probably wouldn\u2019t have. I think you know why.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and shook her head, \u201cOdd to think that the one thing we can agree on is that we don\u2019t want Harry in the same room as me. Although, I suspect it\u2019s for very different reasons.\u201d</p><p>Once again, she became distracted, but this time there was nobody talking in her ear. She frowned and chewed her bottom lip, staring at where I\u2019d just hidden my phone as she seemed to debate \u00a0over something in her head.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes lifted to meet mine and she let her wall down. Leaning in close to me, Layla asked with a need that completely changed my opinion of her, \u201cplease, Gemma, is he really okay? I just want to know that he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. She was close to tears, her bottom lip wobbling before she caught it between her teeth, and I could sense that it had been a long time since she\u2019d allowed herself to let thoughts of Harry get to her. I\u2019d come to talk to her because I wanted to hurt her emotionally, I\u2019d wanted her to know that me, and all the other people who\u2019d helped Harry put himself back together, would never forget what she had done. But I didn\u2019t want to do that anymore. Layla was torturing herself enough over it, and she didn\u2019t need me to tell her how much Harry was hurting, she already knew it because she was going through exactly the same amount of pain.</p><p>Finding myself reaching out and touching her arm, I looked her in the eyes and said, with as much conviction as I could muster, \u201cHe really is, Layla. He wasn\u2019t for a while, and that made me furious with you, but\u2026 but you did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I question that.\u201d Tears spilled onto her cheeks as she scoffed, and she carefully wiped them away with the tips of her fingers. \u201cI miss him a lot, Gemma, I really do. I miss him so much sometimes that it physically hurts, but I needed to get my life together. We were becoming so toxic that I would never have been able to fix all the other things that were broken while I was worrying that he wanted someone else, or that he was unhappy being with me. I know that you hated me, and you all probably hate me even more now, but I want you to know that I did love him. I still do. But\u2026\u201d She shrugged sadly, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t keep having my heart broken.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, I nodded and looked over to where Lou was standing, seeing her just as she ended a call with a worried grimace. Harry had obviously tried calling her after I\u2019d ignored him, and I could only imagine how frantic with worry he was that Layla and I were tearing each other\u2019s hair out. I let out a sigh, and turned my focus back to Layla. She\u2019d regained her composure, and was holding her clipboard tightly to her chest like armour, waiting for my response.</p><p>\u201cWe never hated you, Layla, we were just worried for Harry.\u201d I chuckled, hoping to keep the conversation positive, \u201cSee! That\u2019s another thing we can agree on - we both just want what\u2019s best for Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d exhaling, she forced a watery smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad we spoke, and I\u2019m really happy that Harry\u2019s moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we did too, and it saves any awkwardness for any future run-ins,\u201d we both laughed, and I almost saw the wall go back up and her turn back into the friendly, professional person I\u2019d first approached. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to work, or Rose will probably shout at me.\u201d</p><p>Layla laughed again - cheeks dimpling, not unlike Harry\u2019s - and nodded in agreement, and we looked over to where Rose was stood, watching us closely. I was about to say goodbye and walk away, when she blurted out, \u201cThis is totally your call but, tell him I said hello.\u201d</p><p>We both knew there was slim chance of me passing on her regards, but I told her I would, and that seemed to make her happy. We said goodbye, and I headed back over to Lou who grimaced as I got close.</p><p>\u201cHarry wants you to call him.\u201d Handing me a cocktail, which I drank down in two gulps, she quickly added, \"and I\u2019m sorry, but he knows you were talking to her. How did it go? It seemed like it went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really, really expected to hate her, and I thought she\u2019d be totally uncaring about him, but she\u2026 she really loves him. This whole time, I was convinced she\u2019d broken his heart, but he broke hers too.\u201d I looked around the room, at the event Layla and Rose had put together impeccably. I could see them talking to the woman whose product launch it was, and again, I barely recognised Layla as the red-eyed woman who\u2019d been in Harry\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to say to Haz?\u201d Lou asked, forcing me to face that I would eventually have to call him and give him some version of our conversation. \u201cDo you think this is going to make things bad again?\u201d</p><p>Digging my phone out of my bag, I saw three missed calls from Harry. I regretted telling him I was at the same party as Layla, and I wished I knew for certain what would make it all easier for him. As it was, I could only hope I was doing the right thing by letting them both think that the other was doing just fine.</p><p>Signalling for Lou to follow me out, so I could call my brother, I made a decision, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him that she\u2019s happy, and that she\u2019s moving on. That\u2019s what I told her he was doing, and that seemed to make her happy. I just hope that it does the same for him.\u201c</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e841586a479005e79589123ddc55960b/tumblr_inline_pj61sx2vpZ1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>Harry</b></p><p>Ending the call, I drove to Jeff\u2019s calmly while I processed what Gemma had told me. I turned the radio up loud to keep the barrage of conflicting thoughts at bay, but as I pulled up to the house and parked, my chest tightened, and I felt the horrible realisation creep up on me that Layla and I were truly over.</p><p>I\u2019d been holding on to the idea that somehow we\u2019d get back together, a secret hope, which made each day apart that little bit more bearable. But Gemma had told me that Layla was happy without me, she was running her own business, and what killed me the most, even dating someone. Putting my head on the steering wheel, I let the pain engulf me, a fresh new wound opening because Layla no longer needed me like I needed her. I\u2019d enjoyed being her strength, being the positive in her life when Will had treated her so badly, but she didn\u2019t need to rely on me for that anymore. My fuck up had made certain that I was a positive that had become a big, fat negative, and for that, I was left behind, not knowing how to move forward.</p>",

No reminders of her, no chances of bumping into her and no risk of seeing anyone she knew. The letters might be in her name, twice, but LA. was a Layla free zone.</p>[[MORE]]<p>For the past year, I\u2019d been playing out of sight, out of mind. I\u2019d had plenty to keep my self occupied: issues with Zayn, until he finally left, dealing with that fall out, touring, recording, and promotion. There hadn\u2019t been too much of a gap where I could wallow in what had happened, and I was thankful for that (even if it left me completely exhausted).</p><p>But now we were on an unlimited break, and we needed it. Five years was a long time to be performing nonstop, and I missed the constant distraction. Jeff, to his credit, was making me focus on the future. I was already setting plans in motion for a solo album, and I\u2019d even auditioned to be in a movie, to really take a step out of my comfort zone. It worked up to a point, but there were always moments where the smallest thing would make me think of her. I\u2019d be going over my lines for an audition, or I\u2019d be trying to write a song, and she\u2019d pop into my head. It would take so long to regain control of my thoughts, scolding myself for letting them wander, before I was wrangling them back into their box. She was the first person I wanted to tell things to when something good or bad happened. I\u2019d wanted nothing more than to speak to her when Zayn had left the band. Losing him reminded me of losing her, and all I wanted was to hear her tell me that everything was going to be fine.</p><p>I\u2019d made plans to return to England, to prepare for filming, and even though it was back home and not London, just being that close made the temptation to go see Layla too big. Maybe - I hoped - being in the place where I grew up, with my mum and Robin, with old school friends, and with the nervous excitement of attempting something I had never done before on my mind, it would help me forget her. Even if only for a little while.</p><p>Today was a good day though; I was going to meet Jeff and Glenne, have lunch and hang out, try and remember that I was technically on holiday so I didn\u2019t have to be on the go constantly. The glorious California sunshine made it easy to get out of bed and face the day, and being with two of my best friends made it even easier.</p><p>Parking the car outside the restaurant in which I was meeting them, I noticed a few paparazzi in the rearview mirror and sighed - they\u2019d probably followed me from home, or someone from the restaurant had guessed that if Jeff was going to be there, then so would I. Some days it felt like I wasn\u2019t on a break at all. If it wasn\u2019t the paps shoving their lenses in my face and asking about girlfriends, it was fans constantly asking for photos while I was just out trying to buy a smoothie.</p><p>Grabbing my phone from its holster on the dashboard, I opened the car door and stepped out to be met with a chorus of clicks and questions. I scowled at the cameras then looked down to see a series of messages from Gem.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br><i>I probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this\u2026</i><br><i>I\u2019m at an event with Lou, and Layla\u2019s here</i></p><p>Had there not been anyone around me, I\u2019d have stopped dead and clutched my stomach. Just seeing Layla\u2019s name made it clench and lurch. Below the texts was a picture of Lou, her usual peace sign posed, and behind her hand was the woman who broke my heart. The sun, and my rushed footsteps, were making it difficult to see her properly, but I knew it was her, and I\u2019d never experienced such a feeling of almighty loss, mixed with a rush of overwhelming love and relief, at seeing her after so long. I\u2019d obviously taken too long to react since opening Gem\u2019s messages because another one came through.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br><i>Shit! I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.</i></p><p>I walked into the restaurant, but instead of going to find my friends, I headed to the bathroom and locked myself in a cubicle. It was torture, but I wanted to study every detail of her picture. Layla\u2019s hair was shorter but still blonde, she was tucking a loose curl behind her ear and smiling to a red headed woman I recognised as Rose. The picture was grainy and pixelated so I turned up the brightness and zoomed in, wishing the photo would reveal more; was she happy? Was she seeing someone? Did she still hate me?</p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>What\u2019s she doing there?</i></p><p>My fingers shook as I typed, my rings making my movements so heavy and clumsy that I wanted to tear them off. Common sense told me to go meet my friends and to not let it affect me so much that \u00a0my sister, and closest friend, were in the same room as the person I desperately wanted to be but my feet were stuck. Thankfully, Gemma didn\u2019t make me wait too long for a reply.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br><i>I think her and a friend organised the event. Should I have not told you? I didn\u2019t want to keep it from you. Are you OK?</i></p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>It\u2019s fine, I\u2019m just surprised. Have you spoken to her?</i></p><p>Closing my eyes, I leant my head against the wall and tried to breathe normally. Another message came through, but to my annoyance it was just \u00a0Jeff asking if he\u2019d imagined seeing me arrive. I quickly replied that I\u2019d be with them in a minute then sent a message to my sister. I shouldn\u2019t have asked if they\u2019d spoken, torn between wanting to find out everything about her life now, and worried Gemma would be horrible to her out of loyalty, so I was reluctant to wait for an answer. I\u2019d also spent months convincing mum and Gem that I was over Layla, that maybe they had been right about it just being infatuation, but that I was okay now. I probably should have just left it at my surprise.</p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>Don\u2019t speak to her, Gem, not unless she speaks to you first. Please.</i></p><p>Hitting send, I left the toilet cubicle and headed downstairs. I walked through the restaurant to find my friends, and I could hear some mutterings as I passed tables, my name being whispered excitedly behind menus and against the rims of glasses. But when I spotted Jeff and Glenne, I ignored the murmurs and readied my smile - the pang of jealousy I usually got from seeing them together was there, but it was normally fleeting. After Gem\u2019s messages, it was like a punch to the gut.</p><p>\u201cHersh!\u201d Jeff grinned as soon as he spotted me approaching them, \u201cWe were getting worried, man.\u201d</p><p>The couple rose from their chairs and greeted me like we hadn\u2019t seen each other in weeks, but in fact it had actually only been a day or two.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I needed to make a quick call. My sister,\u201d I explained as we took our seats, and Jeff handed me the menu he no doubt knew off by heart because I\u2019d kept them waiting so long.</p><p>\"Everything alright?\u201d Glenne asked, concerned, making me feel bad for the lie.</p><p>\u201cNothing serious,\u201d I answered, forcing a smile, \u201chave you guys ordered?\u201d</p><p>Once we\u2019d ordered food, my mind went quickly back to Gemma and why she still hadn\u2019t responded to my last message. I knew I was being quiet and distracted, but try as I might, my focus was stuck on that photo and what was happening over five thousand miles away.</p><p>After the third time of asking Jeff to repeat a question because I hadn\u2019t been listening, he threw his hands up and asked outright, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it! What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s been like talking to a wall since you got here.\u201d He leant his elbows on the table and looked me in the eye, but I didn\u2019t have the chance to speak before he rolled his eyes, \u201cit\u2019s Layla, right?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to have cottoned on to how I behaved when something related to her had upset me. He either knew me too well, or I did a much worse job at hiding it than I thought.</p><p>Jeff and Glenne knew all about my relationship with Layla, but they had been the biggest naysayers - along with mum and Gemma - and they\u2019d made no secret of being relieved when I had told them it was over for good. Just like mum had been, they\u2019d both been sympathetic, but were always quick to tell me that it was for the best. Jeff was a smart man, and he knew that the baggage Layla brought would affect my career at its most pivotal - I\u2019d started to finally escape the tabloid rumours of multiple girlfriends and older women, I would only undo all the hard work if suddenly I was found out to be in a relationship with a divorced woman in her thirties. That\u2019s how he saw it anyway, and while he wasn\u2019t exactly wrong, I should have handled the situation better than just impulsively jumping into bed with someone without talking to Layla first about my concerns. My friends and family had been against me being with Layla, but I\u2019d been the coward who had messed it up.</p><p>\u201cGemma\u2019s at an event and\u2026 Layla\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Her name felt weird in my mouth, I thought it a hundred times a day, but I didn\u2019t dare ever say it aloud because it was usually met with looks of concern or annoyance. Picking my phone up off the table, I showed them the picture, more for my benefit than theirs - I just wanted to look at it again.</p><p>The couple exchanged a look, but Glenne spoke before Jeff had the chance, \u201cDo you really want to go down this road again?\u201d Realising how harsh her words had sounded, she looked me in the eye, and asked, softly, \u201care you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel numb, I think.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>The truth was, I hadn\u2019t even left the said road, Layla was always on my mind from the moment I woke up. But the conversation was too heavy for the setting, and my emotions were too near the surface for me to really talk about how seeing her felt without running the risk of breaking down. Numb was the right word for now, but that barely covered how I truly felt; I wanted to weep, to shout, to punch a wall, and let my heart break all over again. Instead, I gave the picture one last glance and turned the phone over to lay the screen flat on the table.</p><p>\u201cH, you have so much to look forward to,\u201d Jeff spoke, his statement sounding like a matter of fact, \u201cyou need to forget her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t unsympathetic, neither of them were, but other than mum and Gemma, he was the only one who knew the full story. He\u2019d made me leave the house when I just wanted to lie in bed, he\u2019d sobered me up when I\u2019d escaped London to LA and had thought drowning my sorrows was a good idea, and he\u2019d continuously reminded me that I had to keep going, that wallowing in self-pity wasn\u2019t going to fix anything. He had already been wary of Layla - watching me fall to pieces, and having to repeatedly put me back together - so nobody suspected what I was going through, and it only made him dislike her more. I imagined that after our holiday in St. Barts, and my rekindling a relationship with Kendall, he had hoped that maybe I truly was back on track again. I also imagined that he was now expecting a major setback.</p><p>I let out a loud sigh, sitting back in my chair and running my fingers through my long hair which would soon be cropped short. \u201cThis is just a setback, and a bit of shock. I\u2019m also worried why Gem hasn\u2019t replied to my last message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re brawling!\u201d Jeff laughed, then when he saw my eyes widen in panic, he quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m joking, H.\u201d</p><p>Logically, I knew Jeff\u2019s comment was a flippant joke, but Gemma\u2019s radio silence was making me nervous, and it had me picturing Lou and Rose tearing the girls apart as they kicked and punched and screamed hateful words at each other. My sister was still furious with Layla - so much so that I could almost see the steam shooting from her ears whenever the subject was brought up - so I couldn\u2019t entirely write off the possibility of a punch up. My sister, while fairly mild mannered, could have a vicious and barbed tongue when pushed, so I knew she would be fine. But Layla, after years of being scared to say how she felt because of Will shutting her down any time she opened her mouth, had me worried for her. Gemma was not unkind, but she was one of my biggest and fiercest protectors, and all she could see was that Layla broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no good, I need to call her.\u201d Getting up suddenly, I saw the look of worry on my friends\u2019 faces - one I thankfully hadn\u2019t seen for a few months - and clarified, \u201cGemma, I\u2019m calling Gemma. I\u2019ll be quick, I promise, you guys order dessert and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>It did little to placate them; Jeff shrugged a shoulder at his future wife because there was nothing he could to to stop me. They were concerned and frustrated that I was so hung up on this woman, but they at least loved me enough to let me get over it at my own pace and always be there \u00a0when they had to pick up the pieces.</p><p>Near the doors, I grabbed a passing waiter and asked him if there was somewhere private I could go to make a call. With the paps outside, and other diners looking like they were building up the courage to approach me and ask for photos, I needed to be alone without any interruptions. I would play the celebrity once I knew two of the people I loved the most weren\u2019t tearing each other\u2019s hair out. The waiter led me into a private dining room and quickly left me alone, but the phone was against my ear and ringing before he\u2019d even closed the door. To my annoyance - but not to my surprise - the first few attempts rang and rang then went to voicemail. So, I decided to try the other person I knew who was at the party and thankfully she picked up almost instantly.</p><p>\u201cIs Gemma with you?\u201d I asked, skipping over the weak greeting Lou gave.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d I could hear music and chatting in the background while she stalled, and I stupidly even tried to see if I could pick out Layla\u2019s voice, \u201c\u2026no, she isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLou, where\u2019s my sister?\u201d My patience already wearing thin, anger started to bubble at the thought that despite how long we\u2019d been friends, she would consider lying to me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 fine! She\u2019s talking to Layla.\u201d Defeated, she sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d I knew that it was a good sign that Lou was on the phone to me and not breaking up a fight, but her distracted replied indicated that she was waiting for something to happen that meant she might have to step in. \u201cLou! What are they doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaz, calm down, they\u2019re just talking,\u201d Lou said, attempting to soothe me, but the panic was in full flow, and I was past the point of calming down. Steadying myself against the table in front of me, I wished I could go there and see Lil, and stop Gemma from lashing out.</p><p>\u201cPlease, you have to get her to call me as soon as she\u2019s done\u201d. Pleading, I fought back asking her to get them away from each other, knowing that her intervening would look even more like an attack on Layla. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, of course, I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d She sighed again, but this time it was more like Jeff\u2019s shrug, accepting that there was no point in trying to reason with me until I spoke to my sister.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2d4a738cbd5ab117a38033b5a5a50fc/tumblr_inline_pj61rrgRa51w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>Gemma</b></p><p>It had taken a moment for me to click who she was; her hair was shorter and blonder, and she was taller because of her high-heels, but the most noticeably different thing, which made her almost completely unrecognisable, was that she looked happy.</p><p>The night we\u2019d met in Harry\u2019s kitchen, she\u2019d been drinking, and I could tell she\u2019d been crying; her eyes were a little puffy and red, and she had an aura of unbelievable sadness around her. Layla, that night, had been quiet, demure, and a little standoffish - not at all what I expected from the woman who had Harry so besotted. But this Layla who was rushing around, making passing jokes with her friend, and greeting everyone with a warm and genuine smile, I could understand his attraction to her more.</p><p>Mum and I had spent months worrying about Harry and how much he\u2019d been broken by the end of the relationship. At first, we put it all down to infatuation, and the age old adage \u2018you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got \u2018til it\u2019s gone\u2019, but we quickly went from telling him he had nobody to blame but himself for cheating on her, to being furious with Layla for causing him so much pain. I didn\u2019t hate her for finishing her relationship with my brother - that had actually been a huge relief for all of us - but I hated how she did it. It felt so cold and callous. It made Harry question if he ever loved her, and made it impossible to reassure him that she had, because her actions seemed to show that it was easy for her to cut him out of her life completely. From the start, we\u2019d been worried he would end up brokenhearted and pining for a woman who was old enough to know better, so when exactly that happened, it made us all angry with her. Just seeing her at the party, smiling like she didn\u2019t have a care in the world, made my blood boil. I wanted to cause a scene and tell her exactly what I thought of her.</p><p>What stopped me from giving her a public dressing down, was Harry\u2019s response to my momentary lapse of reason in telling him I was with her. He tried to sound unbothered, but the panic and desperation to know more radiated from his messages. I wanted to speak to her, to give her a piece of my mind, but I vowed to myself and Lou that I wouldn\u2019t make a scene.</p><p>When I finally calmed myself, and approached Layla, she was talking to her friend at the bar. They both looked surprised to see me come over, but while Layla\u2019s face changed to worry, the friend looked ready - despite how pretty and angelic she seemed - to fight to the death if I was there to cause an argument. The redhead backed down when Layla touched her arm and greeted me warmly, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it was out of professionalism or because she knew it would probably get back to Harry.</p><p>The two of us exchanged greetings then fell silent. I wanted to tear her to shreds, but the cold, blue-eyed glower from her friend had its desired effect by keeping me quiet, so it was Layla who spoke again.</p><p>\u201cGemma, this is my friend and business partner, Rose. Rose, this is Harry\u2019s sister, Gemma,\u201d she said, with a warning glance at her friend.</p><p>In a three-sixty change, Rose smiled at me genuinely and spoke with a thick London accent that sounded strange coming from someone who looked so\u2026 otherworldly, \"it\u2019s so nice to meet you, Gemma, are you enjoying the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too, and I am, thank you! Are you two the planners?\u201d I asked, glancing at Layla, who was looking at me with a strange expression on her face. I wanted to defensively ask what she was staring at but she spoke before I had the chance.</p><p>\u201cWe are! It\u2019s only our third event, but other than a tube strike making a few of our servers late, there hasn\u2019t been any drama so far!\u201d</p><p>The three of us forced a laugh, and I caught the not-so-subtle hint that she hoped I wasn\u2019t going to be the one to cause any drama. Once again, I caught her peering closely at me, and it dawned on me that maybe she was was looking for a resemblance between me and Harry. To the untrained eye, there wasn\u2019t much of one, but from the way she cast her gaze down, and pretended to look at her hot pink clipboard, I could tell she\u2019d found it.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a second to chat?\u201d I asked, suddenly feeling nervous. I\u2019d gone over with all guns blazing, having every intention of calmly making sure she knew what she\u2019d done, but the two friends\u2019 being so genuinely welcoming had caught me completely off guard. Now, I not only wanted to tell her how much she\u2019d broken Harry\u2019s heart, but I also wanted her to help me understand why.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Smiling and placing the clipboard she\u2019d held onto the bar, she turned to me and gave me her full attention.</p><p>Without having to be asked, Rose took her cue and excused herself. \u201cI\u2019m on the headset if you need me,\u201d she reminded Layla, tapping her ear before shooting me a look that I imagined would put the fear of God into many people stronger than I. It felt like a threat when she said to me, \u201cenjoy your evening, Gemma, let us know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pussy-cat, really,\u201d Layla grinned as she watched her friend walk away from us. She then turned to look me dead in the eye, \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you would want to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, and answering honestly, I admitted, \u201cI nearly didn\u2019t, and\u2026\u201d she cocked her head to one side, and I decided that mentioning Harry knew she was at the party with me was not a good idea, not yet, \u201c\u2026but, I felt we should at least say hello and address the elephant in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciate that, thank you.\u201d She relaxed a little, and became a little less on the defensive, more open to what I had to say. \u201cHow\u2019s Harry?\u201d</p><p>The question took me so by surprise that had she slapped me around the face I\u2019d have been less shocked. There was no gentle build up, she just asked outright what she wanted to know. Looking her over, I considered my reply, and the intent of her asking how he was. Her face was impassive, but there was a flash of something in her eyes that was gone before I could be certain what it was.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really good! He\u2019s really, really happy!\u201d Layla, the woman who was throwing me off at every turn, did it once more by giving a wide, genuine smile of relief, like she\u2019d genuinely been worried he might not be. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying his time off.\u201d</p><p>Placing both hands on her heart, she chuckled, \u201cI don\u2019t think you realise how good that is to hear. I\u2019m- I\u2019m really glad he\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not long come back from his New Year\u2019s holiday in St. Bart\u2019s with his girlfriend, Kendall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Has he? Uh\u2026\u201c</p><p>This time, I caught the fleeting moment where she reacted exactly how I expected her to - her face fell, and she looked like she was about to cry or throw-up - but it was brief. Quickly, she was back to being happy that Harry had moved on, forcing a smile, determined not to show me that being told about Harry\u2019s holiday romance had affected her. I felt it unnecessary to tell her that he wasn\u2019t actually with Kendall anymore.</p><p>\"Well, I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s happy!\u201d She said. \u201cThat\u2019s really all I ever wanted, believe it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is happy,\u201d I replied, still unsure if I did in fact believe it. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Layla paused, and the petty part of me was pleased that this time it was me who had taken her by surprise. Looking at me sceptically, I saw her try to work out if the question was a trap, and if she told me she was, I would tell her she didn\u2019t deserve happiness after what she did.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Smiling coyly, and probably hoping that wasn\u2019t the wrong thing to say, she continued, \u201cwe\u2019re just getting things off the ground with the business so I\u2019m working like crazy, and\u2026 like Harry, I\u2019m even dating a little. Nothing serious, I don\u2019t feel ready for that yet.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she was distracted, looking off to the other side of the bar and putting a finger to her ear to hear what was being said in her headset. Feeling my phone vibrating in my bag, I pulled it out, and wasn\u2019t surprised to see the picture of Harry I\u2019d taken the Christmas just gone, which signalled his call. I let it go to voicemail, crammed the phone back into my clutch, and hoped Layla hadn\u2019t seen it, but when I looked up, she was watching me with amusement for trying to hide the evidence.</p><p>\u201cYou told him I\u2019m here then?\u201d Layla asked, calmly.</p><p>Sighing, I nodded and shrugged, \u201cI did. But he\u2019s in LA, or I probably wouldn\u2019t have. I think you know why.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and shook her head, \u201cOdd to think that the one thing we can agree on is that we don\u2019t want Harry in the same room as me. Although, I suspect it\u2019s for very different reasons.\u201d</p><p>Once again, she became distracted, but this time there was nobody talking in her ear. She frowned and chewed her bottom lip, staring at where I\u2019d just hidden my phone as she seemed to debate \u00a0over something in her head.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes lifted to meet mine and she let her wall down. Leaning in close to me, Layla asked with a need that completely changed my opinion of her, \u201cplease, Gemma, is he really okay? I just want to know that he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. She was close to tears, her bottom lip wobbling before she caught it between her teeth, and I could sense that it had been a long time since she\u2019d allowed herself to let thoughts of Harry get to her. I\u2019d come to talk to her because I wanted to hurt her emotionally, I\u2019d wanted her to know that me, and all the other people who\u2019d helped Harry put himself back together, would never forget what she had done. But I didn\u2019t want to do that anymore. Layla was torturing herself enough over it, and she didn\u2019t need me to tell her how much Harry was hurting, she already knew it because she was going through exactly the same amount of pain.</p><p>Finding myself reaching out and touching her arm, I looked her in the eyes and said, with as much conviction as I could muster, \u201cHe really is, Layla. He wasn\u2019t for a while, and that made me furious with you, but\u2026 but you did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I question that.\u201d Tears spilled onto her cheeks as she scoffed, and she carefully wiped them away with the tips of her fingers. \u201cI miss him a lot, Gemma, I really do. I miss him so much sometimes that it physically hurts, but I needed to get my life together. We were becoming so toxic that I would never have been able to fix all the other things that were broken while I was worrying that he wanted someone else, or that he was unhappy being with me. I know that you hated me, and you all probably hate me even more now, but I want you to know that I did love him. I still do. But\u2026\u201d She shrugged sadly, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t keep having my heart broken.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, I nodded and looked over to where Lou was standing, seeing her just as she ended a call with a worried grimace. Harry had obviously tried calling her after I\u2019d ignored him, and I could only imagine how frantic with worry he was that Layla and I were tearing each other\u2019s hair out. I let out a sigh, and turned my focus back to Layla. She\u2019d regained her composure, and was holding her clipboard tightly to her chest like armour, waiting for my response.</p><p>\u201cWe never hated you, Layla, we were just worried for Harry.\u201d I chuckled, hoping to keep the conversation positive, \u201cSee! That\u2019s another thing we can agree on - we both just want what\u2019s best for Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d exhaling, she forced a watery smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad we spoke, and I\u2019m really happy that Harry\u2019s moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we did too, and it saves any awkwardness for any future run-ins,\u201d we both laughed, and I almost saw the wall go back up and her turn back into the friendly, professional person I\u2019d first approached. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to work, or Rose will probably shout at me.\u201d</p><p>Layla laughed again - cheeks dimpling, not unlike Harry\u2019s - and nodded in agreement, and we looked over to where Rose was stood, watching us closely. I was about to say goodbye and walk away, when she blurted out, \u201cThis is totally your call but, tell him I said hello.\u201d</p><p>We both knew there was slim chance of me passing on her regards, but I told her I would, and that seemed to make her happy. We said goodbye, and I headed back over to Lou who grimaced as I got close.</p><p>\u201cHarry wants you to call him.\u201d Handing me a cocktail, which I drank down in two gulps, she quickly added, \"and I\u2019m sorry, but he knows you were talking to her. How did it go? It seemed like it went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really, really expected to hate her, and I thought she\u2019d be totally uncaring about him, but she\u2026 she really loves him. This whole time, I was convinced she\u2019d broken his heart, but he broke hers too.\u201d I looked around the room, at the event Layla and Rose had put together impeccably. I could see them talking to the woman whose product launch it was, and again, I barely recognised Layla as the red-eyed woman who\u2019d been in Harry\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to say to Haz?\u201d Lou asked, forcing me to face that I would eventually have to call him and give him some version of our conversation. \u201cDo you think this is going to make things bad again?\u201d</p><p>Digging my phone out of my bag, I saw three missed calls from Harry. I regretted telling him I was at the same party as Layla, and I wished I knew for certain what would make it all easier for him. As it was, I could only hope I was doing the right thing by letting them both think that the other was doing just fine.</p><p>Signalling for Lou to follow me out, so I could call my brother, I made a decision, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him that she\u2019s happy, and that she\u2019s moving on. That\u2019s what I told her he was doing, and that seemed to make her happy. I just hope that it does the same for him.\u201c</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e841586a479005e79589123ddc55960b/tumblr_inline_pj61sx2vpZ1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>Harry</b></p><p>Ending the call, I drove to Jeff\u2019s calmly while I processed what Gemma had told me. I turned the radio up loud to keep the barrage of conflicting thoughts at bay, but as I pulled up to the house and parked, my chest tightened, and I felt the horrible realisation creep up on me that Layla and I were truly over.</p><p>I\u2019d been holding on to the idea that somehow we\u2019d get back together, a secret hope, which made each day apart that little bit more bearable. But Gemma had told me that Layla was happy without me, she was running her own business, and what killed me the most, even dating someone. Putting my head on the steering wheel, I let the pain engulf me, a fresh new wound opening because Layla no longer needed me like I needed her. I\u2019d enjoyed being her strength, being the positive in her life when Will had treated her so badly, but she didn\u2019t need to rely on me for that anymore. My fuck up had made certain that I was a positive that had become a big, fat negative, and for that, I was left behind, not knowing how to move forward.</p>",

No reminders of her, no chances of bumping into her and no risk of seeing anyone she knew. The letters might be in her name, twice, but LA. was a Layla free zone.</p><p>For the past year, I&rsquo;d been playing out of sight, out of mind. I&rsquo;d had plenty to keep my self occupied: issues with Zayn, until he finally left, dealing with that fall out, touring, recording, and promotion. There hadn&rsquo;t been too much of a gap where I could wallow in what had happened, and I was thankful for that (even if it left me completely exhausted).</p><p>But now we were on an unlimited break, and we needed it. Five years was a long time to be performing nonstop, and I missed the constant distraction. Jeff, to his credit, was making me focus on the future. I was already setting plans in motion for a solo album, and I&rsquo;d even auditioned to be in a movie, to really take a step out of my comfort zone. It worked up to a point, but there were always moments where the smallest thing would make me think of her. I&rsquo;d be going over my lines for an audition, or I&rsquo;d be trying to write a song, and she&rsquo;d pop into my head. It would take so long to regain control of my thoughts, scolding myself for letting them wander, before I was wrangling them back into their box. She was the first person I wanted to tell things to when something good or bad happened. I&rsquo;d wanted nothing more than to speak to her when Zayn had left the band. Losing him reminded me of losing her, and all I wanted was to hear her tell me that everything was going to be fine.</p><p>I&rsquo;d made plans to return to England, to prepare for filming, and even though it was back home and not London, just being that close made the temptation to go see Layla too big. Maybe - I hoped - being in the place where I grew up, with my mum and Robin, with old school friends, and with the nervous excitement of attempting something I had never done before on my mind, it would help me forget her. Even if only for a little while.</p><p>Today was a good day though; I was going to meet Jeff and Glenne, have lunch and hang out, try and remember that I was technically on holiday so I didn&rsquo;t have to be on the go constantly. The glorious California sunshine made it easy to get out of bed and face the day, and being with two of my best friends made it even easier.</p><p>Parking the car outside the restaurant in which I was meeting them, I noticed a few paparazzi in the rearview mirror and sighed - they&rsquo;d probably followed me from home, or someone from the restaurant had guessed that if Jeff was going to be there, then so would I. Some days it felt like I wasn&rsquo;t on a break at all. If it wasn&rsquo;t the paps shoving their lenses in my face and asking about girlfriends, it was fans constantly asking for photos while I was just out trying to buy a smoothie.</p><p>Grabbing my phone from its holster on the dashboard, I opened the car door and stepped out to be met with a chorus of clicks and questions. I scowled at the cameras then looked down to see a series of messages from Gem.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br /><i>I probably shouldn&rsquo;t tell you this&hellip;</i><br /><i>I&rsquo;m at an event with Lou, and Layla&rsquo;s here</i></p><p>Had there not been anyone around me, I&rsquo;d have stopped dead and clutched my stomach. Just seeing Layla&rsquo;s name made it clench and lurch. Below the texts was a picture of Lou, her usual peace sign posed, and behind her hand was the woman who broke my heart. The sun, and my rushed footsteps, were making it difficult to see her properly, but I knew it was her, and I&rsquo;d never experienced such a feeling of almighty loss, mixed with a rush of overwhelming love and relief, at seeing her after so long. I&rsquo;d obviously taken too long to react since opening Gem&rsquo;s messages because another one came through.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br /><i>Shit! I shouldn&rsquo;t have said anything.</i></p><p>I walked into the restaurant, but instead of going to find my friends, I headed to the bathroom and locked myself in a cubicle. It was torture, but I wanted to study every detail of her picture. Layla&rsquo;s hair was shorter but still blonde, she was tucking a loose curl behind her ear and smiling to a red headed woman I recognised as Rose. The picture was grainy and pixelated so I turned up the brightness and zoomed in, wishing the photo would reveal more; was she happy? Was she seeing someone? Did she still hate me?</p><p><b>Harry</b><br /><i>What&rsquo;s she doing there?</i></p><p>My fingers shook as I typed, my rings making my movements so heavy and clumsy that I wanted to tear them off. Common sense told me to go meet my friends and to not let it affect me so much that &nbsp;my sister, and closest friend, were in the same room as the person I desperately wanted to be but my feet were stuck. Thankfully, Gemma didn&rsquo;t make me wait too long for a reply.</p><p><b>Gemma</b><br /><i>I think her and a friend organised the event. Should I have not told you? I didn&rsquo;t want to keep it from you. Are you OK?</i></p><p><b>Harry</b><br /><i>It&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;m just surprised. Have you spoken to her?</i></p><p>Closing my eyes, I leant my head against the wall and tried to breathe normally. Another message came through, but to my annoyance it was just &nbsp;Jeff asking if he&rsquo;d imagined seeing me arrive. I quickly replied that I&rsquo;d be with them in a minute then sent a message to my sister. I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked if they&rsquo;d spoken, torn between wanting to find out everything about her life now, and worried Gemma would be horrible to her out of loyalty, so I was reluctant to wait for an answer. I&rsquo;d also spent months convincing mum and Gem that I was over Layla, that maybe they had been right about it just being infatuation, but that I was okay now. I probably should have just left it at my surprise.</p><p><b>Harry</b><br /><i>Don&rsquo;t speak to her, Gem, not unless she speaks to you first. Please.</i></p><p>Hitting send, I left the toilet cubicle and headed downstairs. I walked through the restaurant to find my friends, and I could hear some mutterings as I passed tables, my name being whispered excitedly behind menus and against the rims of glasses. But when I spotted Jeff and Glenne, I ignored the murmurs and readied my smile - the pang of jealousy I usually got from seeing them together was there, but it was normally fleeting. After Gem&rsquo;s messages, it was like a punch to the gut.</p><p>&ldquo;Hersh!&rdquo; Jeff grinned as soon as he spotted me approaching them, &ldquo;We were getting worried, man.&rdquo;</p><p>The couple rose from their chairs and greeted me like we hadn&rsquo;t seen each other in weeks, but in fact it had actually only been a day or two.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I needed to make a quick call. My sister,&rdquo; I explained as we took our seats, and Jeff handed me the menu he no doubt knew off by heart because I&rsquo;d kept them waiting so long.</p><p>\"Everything alright?&rdquo; Glenne asked, concerned, making me feel bad for the lie.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing serious,&rdquo; I answered, forcing a smile, &ldquo;have you guys ordered?&rdquo;</p><p>Once we&rsquo;d ordered food, my mind went quickly back to Gemma and why she still hadn&rsquo;t responded to my last message. I knew I was being quiet and distracted, but try as I might, my focus was stuck on that photo and what was happening over five thousand miles away.</p><p>After the third time of asking Jeff to repeat a question because I hadn&rsquo;t been listening, he threw his hands up and asked outright, &ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s it! What&rsquo;s going on? It&rsquo;s been like talking to a wall since you got here.&rdquo; He leant his elbows on the table and looked me in the eye, but I didn&rsquo;t have the chance to speak before he rolled his eyes, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Layla, right?&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed to have cottoned on to how I behaved when something related to her had upset me. He either knew me too well, or I did a much worse job at hiding it than I thought.</p><p>Jeff and Glenne knew all about my relationship with Layla, but they had been the biggest naysayers - along with mum and Gemma - and they&rsquo;d made no secret of being relieved when I had told them it was over for good. Just like mum had been, they&rsquo;d both been sympathetic, but were always quick to tell me that it was for the best. Jeff was a smart man, and he knew that the baggage Layla brought would affect my career at its most pivotal - I&rsquo;d started to finally escape the tabloid rumours of multiple girlfriends and older women, I would only undo all the hard work if suddenly I was found out to be in a relationship with a divorced woman in her thirties. That&rsquo;s how he saw it anyway, and while he wasn&rsquo;t exactly wrong, I should have handled the situation better than just impulsively jumping into bed with someone without talking to Layla first about my concerns. My friends and family had been against me being with Layla, but I&rsquo;d been the coward who had messed it up.</p><p>&ldquo;Gemma&rsquo;s at an event and&hellip; Layla&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p><p>Her name felt weird in my mouth, I thought it a hundred times a day, but I didn&rsquo;t dare ever say it aloud because it was usually met with looks of concern or annoyance. Picking my phone up off the table, I showed them the picture, more for my benefit than theirs - I just wanted to look at it again.</p><p>The couple exchanged a look, but Glenne spoke before Jeff had the chance, &ldquo;Do you really want to go down this road again?&rdquo; Realising how harsh her words had sounded, she looked me in the eye, and asked, softly, &ldquo;are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I feel numb, I think.&rdquo; I shrugged.</p><p>The truth was, I hadn&rsquo;t even left the said road, Layla was always on my mind from the moment I woke up. But the conversation was too heavy for the setting, and my emotions were too near the surface for me to really talk about how seeing her felt without running the risk of breaking down. Numb was the right word for now, but that barely covered how I truly felt; I wanted to weep, to shout, to punch a wall, and let my heart break all over again. Instead, I gave the picture one last glance and turned the phone over to lay the screen flat on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;H, you have so much to look forward to,&rdquo; Jeff spoke, his statement sounding like a matter of fact, &ldquo;you need to forget her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, and I&rsquo;m trying.&rdquo;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t unsympathetic, neither of them were, but other than mum and Gemma, he was the only one who knew the full story. He&rsquo;d made me leave the house when I just wanted to lie in bed, he&rsquo;d sobered me up when I&rsquo;d escaped London to LA and had thought drowning my sorrows was a good idea, and he&rsquo;d continuously reminded me that I had to keep going, that wallowing in self-pity wasn&rsquo;t going to fix anything. He had already been wary of Layla - watching me fall to pieces, and having to repeatedly put me back together - so nobody suspected what I was going through, and it only made him dislike her more. I imagined that after our holiday in St. Barts, and my rekindling a relationship with Kendall, he had hoped that maybe I truly was back on track again. I also imagined that he was now expecting a major setback.</p><p>I let out a loud sigh, sitting back in my chair and running my fingers through my long hair which would soon be cropped short. &ldquo;This is just a setback, and a bit of shock. I&rsquo;m also worried why Gem hasn&rsquo;t replied to my last message.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re brawling!&rdquo; Jeff laughed, then when he saw my eyes widen in panic, he quickly added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m joking, H.&rdquo;</p><p>Logically, I knew Jeff&rsquo;s comment was a flippant joke, but Gemma&rsquo;s radio silence was making me nervous, and it had me picturing Lou and Rose tearing the girls apart as they kicked and punched and screamed hateful words at each other. My sister was still furious with Layla - so much so that I could almost see the steam shooting from her ears whenever the subject was brought up - so I couldn&rsquo;t entirely write off the possibility of a punch up. My sister, while fairly mild mannered, could have a vicious and barbed tongue when pushed, so I knew she would be fine. But Layla, after years of being scared to say how she felt because of Will shutting her down any time she opened her mouth, had me worried for her. Gemma was not unkind, but she was one of my biggest and fiercest protectors, and all she could see was that Layla broke my heart.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, I need to call her.&rdquo; Getting up suddenly, I saw the look of worry on my friends&rsquo; faces - one I thankfully hadn&rsquo;t seen for a few months - and clarified, &ldquo;Gemma, I&rsquo;m calling Gemma. I&rsquo;ll be quick, I promise, you guys order dessert and I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p><p>It did little to placate them; Jeff shrugged a shoulder at his future wife because there was nothing he could to to stop me. They were concerned and frustrated that I was so hung up on this woman, but they at least loved me enough to let me get over it at my own pace and always be there &nbsp;when they had to pick up the pieces.</p><p>Near the doors, I grabbed a passing waiter and asked him if there was somewhere private I could go to make a call. With the paps outside, and other diners looking like they were building up the courage to approach me and ask for photos, I needed to be alone without any interruptions. I would play the celebrity once I knew two of the people I loved the most weren&rsquo;t tearing each other&rsquo;s hair out. The waiter led me into a private dining room and quickly left me alone, but the phone was against my ear and ringing before he&rsquo;d even closed the door. To my annoyance - but not to my surprise - the first few attempts rang and rang then went to voicemail. So, I decided to try the other person I knew who was at the party and thankfully she picked up almost instantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Gemma with you?&rdquo; I asked, skipping over the weak greeting Lou gave.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; I could hear music and chatting in the background while she stalled, and I stupidly even tried to see if I could pick out Layla&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;&hellip;no, she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lou, where&rsquo;s my sister?&rdquo; My patience already wearing thin, anger started to bubble at the thought that despite how long we&rsquo;d been friends, she would consider lying to me.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip; fine! She&rsquo;s talking to Layla.&rdquo; Defeated, she sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo; I knew that it was a good sign that Lou was on the phone to me and not breaking up a fight, but her distracted replied indicated that she was waiting for something to happen that meant she might have to step in. &ldquo;Lou! What are they doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haz, calm down, they&rsquo;re just talking,&rdquo; Lou said, attempting to soothe me, but the panic was in full flow, and I was past the point of calming down. Steadying myself against the table in front of me, I wished I could go there and see Lil, and stop Gemma from lashing out.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, you have to get her to call me as soon as she&rsquo;s done&rdquo;. Pleading, I fought back asking her to get them away from each other, knowing that her intervening would look even more like an attack on Layla. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, of course, I&rsquo;ll tell her.&rdquo; She sighed again, but this time it was more like Jeff&rsquo;s shrug, accepting that there was no point in trying to reason with me until I spoke to my sister.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2d4a738cbd5ab117a38033b5a5a50fc/tumblr_inline_pj61rrgRa51w7xqut_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Gemma</b></p><p>It had taken a moment for me to click who she was; her hair was shorter and blonder, and she was taller because of her high-heels, but the most noticeably different thing, which made her almost completely unrecognisable, was that she looked happy.</p><p>The night we&rsquo;d met in Harry&rsquo;s kitchen, she&rsquo;d been drinking, and I could tell she&rsquo;d been crying; her eyes were a little puffy and red, and she had an aura of unbelievable sadness around her. Layla, that night, had been quiet, demure, and a little standoffish - not at all what I expected from the woman who had Harry so besotted. But this Layla who was rushing around, making passing jokes with her friend, and greeting everyone with a warm and genuine smile, I could understand his attraction to her more.</p><p>Mum and I had spent months worrying about Harry and how much he&rsquo;d been broken by the end of the relationship. At first, we put it all down to infatuation, and the age old adage &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;til it&rsquo;s gone&rsquo;, but we quickly went from telling him he had nobody to blame but himself for cheating on her, to being furious with Layla for causing him so much pain. I didn&rsquo;t hate her for finishing her relationship with my brother - that had actually been a huge relief for all of us - but I hated how she did it. It felt so cold and callous. It made Harry question if he ever loved her, and made it impossible to reassure him that she had, because her actions seemed to show that it was easy for her to cut him out of her life completely. From the start, we&rsquo;d been worried he would end up brokenhearted and pining for a woman who was old enough to know better, so when exactly that happened, it made us all angry with her. Just seeing her at the party, smiling like she didn&rsquo;t have a care in the world, made my blood boil. I wanted to cause a scene and tell her exactly what I thought of her.</p><p>What stopped me from giving her a public dressing down, was Harry&rsquo;s response to my momentary lapse of reason in telling him I was with her. He tried to sound unbothered, but the panic and desperation to know more radiated from his messages. I wanted to speak to her, to give her a piece of my mind, but I vowed to myself and Lou that I wouldn&rsquo;t make a scene.</p><p>When I finally calmed myself, and approached Layla, she was talking to her friend at the bar. They both looked surprised to see me come over, but while Layla&rsquo;s face changed to worry, the friend looked ready - despite how pretty and angelic she seemed - to fight to the death if I was there to cause an argument. The redhead backed down when Layla touched her arm and greeted me warmly, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was out of professionalism or because she knew it would probably get back to Harry.</p><p>The two of us exchanged greetings then fell silent. I wanted to tear her to shreds, but the cold, blue-eyed glower from her friend had its desired effect by keeping me quiet, so it was Layla who spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;Gemma, this is my friend and business partner, Rose. Rose, this is Harry&rsquo;s sister, Gemma,&rdquo; she said, with a warning glance at her friend.</p><p>In a three-sixty change, Rose smiled at me genuinely and spoke with a thick London accent that sounded strange coming from someone who looked so&hellip; otherworldly, \"it&rsquo;s so nice to meet you, Gemma, are you enjoying the party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you too, and I am, thank you! Are you two the planners?&rdquo; I asked, glancing at Layla, who was looking at me with a strange expression on her face. I wanted to defensively ask what she was staring at but she spoke before I had the chance.</p><p>&ldquo;We are! It&rsquo;s only our third event, but other than a tube strike making a few of our servers late, there hasn&rsquo;t been any drama so far!&rdquo;</p><p>The three of us forced a laugh, and I caught the not-so-subtle hint that she hoped I wasn&rsquo;t going to be the one to cause any drama. Once again, I caught her peering closely at me, and it dawned on me that maybe she was was looking for a resemblance between me and Harry. To the untrained eye, there wasn&rsquo;t much of one, but from the way she cast her gaze down, and pretended to look at her hot pink clipboard, I could tell she&rsquo;d found it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a second to chat?&rdquo; I asked, suddenly feeling nervous. I&rsquo;d gone over with all guns blazing, having every intention of calmly making sure she knew what she&rsquo;d done, but the two friends&rsquo; being so genuinely welcoming had caught me completely off guard. Now, I not only wanted to tell her how much she&rsquo;d broken Harry&rsquo;s heart, but I also wanted her to help me understand why.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Smiling and placing the clipboard she&rsquo;d held onto the bar, she turned to me and gave me her full attention.</p><p>Without having to be asked, Rose took her cue and excused herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the headset if you need me,&rdquo; she reminded Layla, tapping her ear before shooting me a look that I imagined would put the fear of God into many people stronger than I. It felt like a threat when she said to me, &ldquo;enjoy your evening, Gemma, let us know if you need anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pussy-cat, really,&rdquo; Layla grinned as she watched her friend walk away from us. She then turned to look me dead in the eye, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if you would want to talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Nodding, and answering honestly, I admitted, &ldquo;I nearly didn&rsquo;t, and&hellip;&rdquo; she cocked her head to one side, and I decided that mentioning Harry knew she was at the party with me was not a good idea, not yet, &ldquo;&hellip;but, I felt we should at least say hello and address the elephant in the room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I appreciate that, thank you.&rdquo; She relaxed a little, and became a little less on the defensive, more open to what I had to say. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>The question took me so by surprise that had she slapped me around the face I&rsquo;d have been less shocked. There was no gentle build up, she just asked outright what she wanted to know. Looking her over, I considered my reply, and the intent of her asking how he was. Her face was impassive, but there was a flash of something in her eyes that was gone before I could be certain what it was.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s really good! He&rsquo;s really, really happy!&rdquo; Layla, the woman who was throwing me off at every turn, did it once more by giving a wide, genuine smile of relief, like she&rsquo;d genuinely been worried he might not be. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s enjoying his time off.&rdquo;</p><p>Placing both hands on her heart, she chuckled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you realise how good that is to hear. I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m really glad he&rsquo;s happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s not long come back from his New Year&rsquo;s holiday in St. Bart&rsquo;s with his girlfriend, Kendall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Has he? Uh&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>This time, I caught the fleeting moment where she reacted exactly how I expected her to - her face fell, and she looked like she was about to cry or throw-up - but it was brief. Quickly, she was back to being happy that Harry had moved on, forcing a smile, determined not to show me that being told about Harry&rsquo;s holiday romance had affected her. I felt it unnecessary to tell her that he wasn&rsquo;t actually with Kendall anymore.</p><p>\"Well, I&rsquo;m just glad he&rsquo;s happy!&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really all I ever wanted, believe it or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is happy,&rdquo; I replied, still unsure if I did in fact believe it. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Layla paused, and the petty part of me was pleased that this time it was me who had taken her by surprise. Looking at me sceptically, I saw her try to work out if the question was a trap, and if she told me she was, I would tell her she didn&rsquo;t deserve happiness after what she did.</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Smiling coyly, and probably hoping that wasn&rsquo;t the wrong thing to say, she continued, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re just getting things off the ground with the business so I&rsquo;m working like crazy, and&hellip; like Harry, I&rsquo;m even dating a little. Nothing serious, I don&rsquo;t feel ready for that yet.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, she was distracted, looking off to the other side of the bar and putting a finger to her ear to hear what was being said in her headset. Feeling my phone vibrating in my bag, I pulled it out, and wasn&rsquo;t surprised to see the picture of Harry I&rsquo;d taken the Christmas just gone, which signalled his call. I let it go to voicemail, crammed the phone back into my clutch, and hoped Layla hadn&rsquo;t seen it, but when I looked up, she was watching me with amusement for trying to hide the evidence.</p><p>&ldquo;You told him I&rsquo;m here then?&rdquo; Layla asked, calmly.</p><p>Sighing, I nodded and shrugged, &ldquo;I did. But he&rsquo;s in LA, or I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have. I think you know why.&rdquo;</p><p>She chuckled and shook her head, &ldquo;Odd to think that the one thing we can agree on is that we don&rsquo;t want Harry in the same room as me. Although, I suspect it&rsquo;s for very different reasons.&rdquo;</p><p>Once again, she became distracted, but this time there was nobody talking in her ear. She frowned and chewed her bottom lip, staring at where I&rsquo;d just hidden my phone as she seemed to debate &nbsp;over something in her head.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes lifted to meet mine and she let her wall down. Leaning in close to me, Layla asked with a need that completely changed my opinion of her, &ldquo;please, Gemma, is he really okay? I just want to know that he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p><p>I hesitated. She was close to tears, her bottom lip wobbling before she caught it between her teeth, and I could sense that it had been a long time since she&rsquo;d allowed herself to let thoughts of Harry get to her. I&rsquo;d come to talk to her because I wanted to hurt her emotionally, I&rsquo;d wanted her to know that me, and all the other people who&rsquo;d helped Harry put himself back together, would never forget what she had done. But I didn&rsquo;t want to do that anymore. Layla was torturing herself enough over it, and she didn&rsquo;t need me to tell her how much Harry was hurting, she already knew it because she was going through exactly the same amount of pain.</p><p>Finding myself reaching out and touching her arm, I looked her in the eyes and said, with as much conviction as I could muster, &ldquo;He really is, Layla. He wasn&rsquo;t for a while, and that made me furious with you, but&hellip; but you did the right thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes, I question that.&rdquo; Tears spilled onto her cheeks as she scoffed, and she carefully wiped them away with the tips of her fingers. &ldquo;I miss him a lot, Gemma, I really do. I miss him so much sometimes that it physically hurts, but I needed to get my life together. We were becoming so toxic that I would never have been able to fix all the other things that were broken while I was worrying that he wanted someone else, or that he was unhappy being with me. I know that you hated me, and you all probably hate me even more now, but I want you to know that I did love him. I still do. But&hellip;&rdquo; She shrugged sadly, &ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t keep having my heart broken.&rdquo;</p><p>Wordlessly, I nodded and looked over to where Lou was standing, seeing her just as she ended a call with a worried grimace. Harry had obviously tried calling her after I&rsquo;d ignored him, and I could only imagine how frantic with worry he was that Layla and I were tearing each other&rsquo;s hair out. I let out a sigh, and turned my focus back to Layla. She&rsquo;d regained her composure, and was holding her clipboard tightly to her chest like armour, waiting for my response.</p><p>&ldquo;We never hated you, Layla, we were just worried for Harry.&rdquo; I chuckled, hoping to keep the conversation positive, &ldquo;See! That&rsquo;s another thing we can agree on - we both just want what&rsquo;s best for Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; exhaling, she forced a watery smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we spoke, and I&rsquo;m really happy that Harry&rsquo;s moving on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we did too, and it saves any awkwardness for any future run-ins,&rdquo; we both laughed, and I almost saw the wall go back up and her turn back into the friendly, professional person I&rsquo;d first approached. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you get back to work, or Rose will probably shout at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Layla laughed again - cheeks dimpling, not unlike Harry&rsquo;s - and nodded in agreement, and we looked over to where Rose was stood, watching us closely. I was about to say goodbye and walk away, when she blurted out, &ldquo;This is totally your call but, tell him I said hello.&rdquo;</p><p>We both knew there was slim chance of me passing on her regards, but I told her I would, and that seemed to make her happy. We said goodbye, and I headed back over to Lou who grimaced as I got close.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry wants you to call him.&rdquo; Handing me a cocktail, which I drank down in two gulps, she quickly added, \"and I&rsquo;m sorry, but he knows you were talking to her. How did it go? It seemed like it went well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really, really expected to hate her, and I thought she&rsquo;d be totally uncaring about him, but she&hellip; she really loves him. This whole time, I was convinced she&rsquo;d broken his heart, but he broke hers too.&rdquo; I looked around the room, at the event Layla and Rose had put together impeccably. I could see them talking to the woman whose product launch it was, and again, I barely recognised Layla as the red-eyed woman who&rsquo;d been in Harry&rsquo;s kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to say to Haz?&rdquo; Lou asked, forcing me to face that I would eventually have to call him and give him some version of our conversation. &ldquo;Do you think this is going to make things bad again?&rdquo;</p><p>Digging my phone out of my bag, I saw three missed calls from Harry. I regretted telling him I was at the same party as Layla, and I wished I knew for certain what would make it all easier for him. As it was, I could only hope I was doing the right thing by letting them both think that the other was doing just fine.</p><p>Signalling for Lou to follow me out, so I could call my brother, I made a decision, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell him that she&rsquo;s happy, and that she&rsquo;s moving on. That&rsquo;s what I told her he was doing, and that seemed to make her happy. I just hope that it does the same for him.&ldquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e841586a479005e79589123ddc55960b/tumblr_inline_pj61sx2vpZ1w7xqut_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Harry</b></p><p>Ending the call, I drove to Jeff&rsquo;s calmly while I processed what Gemma had told me. I turned the radio up loud to keep the barrage of conflicting thoughts at bay, but as I pulled up to the house and parked, my chest tightened, and I felt the horrible realisation creep up on me that Layla and I were truly over.</p><p>I&rsquo;d been holding on to the idea that somehow we&rsquo;d get back together, a secret hope, which made each day apart that little bit more bearable. But Gemma had told me that Layla was happy without me, she was running her own business, and what killed me the most, even dating someone. Putting my head on the steering wheel, I let the pain engulf me, a fresh new wound opening because Layla no longer needed me like I needed her. I&rsquo;d enjoyed being her strength, being the positive in her life when Will had treated her so badly, but she didn&rsquo;t need to rely on me for that anymore. My fuck up had made certain that I was a positive that had become a big, fat negative, and for that, I was left behind, not knowing how to move forward.</p>",
