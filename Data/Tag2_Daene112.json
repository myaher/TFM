        "body": "<p>For the longest time, I wanted to\nwrite about Dany as a leader and a ruler. Most of the time, the metas I see from\nDany haters just talk about what an awful ruler Dany is, and amongst Daenerys\nfans, this is usually not discussed a lot, mostly because I think Dany fans\nspend a lot of time defending Dany from the accusations that she is evil or\nmad, so other subjects are neglected. Before I start, I just want to make it\nclear that I am not any expert on medieval politics or war strategy, so this\nwill be mostly my understanding of the story. And of course, I can\u2019t forget to\nmention that many of the ideas of the Meereenese Blot are here as well, but\nthis is going to be my interpretation.</p><p>In this analysis, I will show why I\nthink Daenerys is an intelligent and capable leader and ruler. I want to look\nat everything we know about Dany in all of the books: her childhood and education,\nher political beliefs, her actions and the economic and political situation\nshe\u2019s in. I\u2019ll try to focus on what Dany has learned in each book, and how it\nhelped her become a better leader.</p><p>Some of the things I\u2019ll write here\nare similar to metas that I\u2019ve written before. But I want this one to be as\ncomplete as possible, and to analyze every facet of Dany\u2019s storyline as a ruler\nthat I can think of. I will bring book quotes to back up what I say, so this\nwill be <i>very</i> long (It\u2019s around 20k\nwords, so I hope at least someone will be interested in reading it, because I\nspent months scrutinizing all of the books to write this).</p><p>In this essay, I will talk about the following topics:</p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s childhood and education</b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s intelligence, wisdom and introspectiveness</b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s changing political views</b></p><p><b>Dany journey as a leader in A Game of Thrones</b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Clash of Kings</b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Storm of Swords<br/></b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Dance with Dragons:<br/></b></p><ul><li><b>Economy</b></li><li><b>The war against Yunkai and the question of peace and war</b></li><li><b>The question of taking the wealth of the slave masters</b></li><li><b>Conflicting interests within the city</b></li><li><b>Morality</b></li><li><b>Practical aspects or ruling</b></li><li><b>Dany&rsquo;s equalitarian practices</b></li><li><b>Some mistakes worth addressing</b></li></ul><p><b>Is Daenerys a good ruler? What did she learn?</b></p><!-- more --><p><b>DANY\u2019S CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION</b><br/></p><p>Dany spent her childhood poor,\nhomeless, and had to go from place to place, never stopping for too long. She\ndidn\u2019t have money or stability to have a formal education: </p><blockquote><p><i><b>After Ser Willem had died</b>, the servants had stolen what\nlittle money they had left, and soon after <b>they had been put out of the big\nhouse.</b> Dany had cried when the\u00a0red\u00a0door\u00a0closed behind them\nforever.</i></p><p><i><b>They had wandered since then</b>, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr\nto Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, <b>never staying long in any one\nplace. </b>Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper&rsquo;s hired knives were close\nbehind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.</i></p><p><i><b>At first the magisters\nand archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to\ntheir homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to\nsit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner.</b> Years past\nthey had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin\nthey had gotten from Mother&rsquo;s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of\nPentos, they called her brother &ldquo;the beggar king.&rdquo; Dany did not want\nto know what they called her. \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Dany\nlater confirms that she indeed never had any formal education:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Tell me of this other Daenerys. <b>I know less than I\nshould of the history of my father&rsquo;s kingdom. I never had\na\u00a0maester\u00a0growing up.</b>&rdquo; Only a brother. \u2013 </i>Daenerys VIII ADWD<i></i></p></blockquote><p>But we also have this quote:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;A queen must listen to all,&rdquo; [&hellip;] <b>She had read that in a\u00a0book.</b> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I ASOS<i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany spent her childhood poor,\nhomeless, without receiving a formal education. Most of what Dany knows comes\nfrom Viserys, from her own experience, and from a few books she has read. Given\nthat Dany and Viserys were poor, I imagine that the only times that Dany\nhad access to books were when they were guests at some archon\u2019s or prince\u2019s\nhome, and this was only in the beginning, before the doors started closing on\nthem. I think this is the first thing we need to know if we want to understand Dany\u2019s mistakes and beliefs, and not crucify her for them. Daenerys is not\nsupposed to start the story as a great leader who makes no mistakes. Her story,\nfrom the very beginning, is all about learning.</p><p><b>DANY\u2019S INTELLIGENCE, WISDOM AND INTROSPECTIVENESS</b></p><p>Despite lacking education and\nexperience, Dany shows herself to be very intelligent and wise.</p><p>Dany is observant, always aware of\nher situation, surroundings and of the people around her:</p><blockquote><p><i>Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he&rsquo;d never had a friend he wouldn&rsquo;t cheerfully sell for the right price. <b>Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things</b>, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The cobbler thanked her for that, and the old brickmaker kissed her foot, </i><b><i>but the weaver looked at her with eyes as hard as slate. She knows I lie, the queen thought.</i> </b>- Daenerys V ADWD<br/></p></blockquote><p>She is not\ngullible:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Why does he give\nus so much?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What does he want from us?&rdquo; For nigh on\nhalf a year, they had lived in the magister&rsquo;s house, eating his food, pampered\nby his servants. <b>Dany was thirteen, old\nenough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the\nfree city of Pentos.</b>\u00a0\u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT<i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;They are your people, and they love you well,&rdquo;\nMagister Illyrio said amiably. &ldquo;In holdfasts all across the realm, men\nlift secret toasts to your\u00a0health\u00a0while women sew dragon banners and\nhide them against the day of your return from across the water.&rdquo; He gave a\nmassive shrug. &ldquo;Or so my agents tell me.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Dany had no agents, no way of\nknowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she\nmistrusted Illyrio&rsquo;s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio.</i></b><i> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\ntook the warlock&rsquo;s words well salted</i></b><i>, but the magnificence of the great city was not to\nbe denied. \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I do not\nunderstand her.&rdquo; <b>Pyat and Xaro had\nshowered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons,\ndeclaring themselves her loyal servants in all things,</b> but from Quaithe she\nhad gotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never\nseen the woman&rsquo;s face. <b>Remember\u00a0Mirri\u00a0Maz\nDuur, she told herself. Remember treachery. She turned to her bloodriders.\n&ldquo;We will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that no one enters\nthis wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that the dragons are always\nwell guarded.</b>&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Thirteen. To be sure.\nXaro was one of the Thirteen. No doubt he had convinced each of his fellow\nmembers to give up one ship. She knew the merchant prince too well to think\nthat he would sacrifice thirteen of his own ships. <b>&ldquo;I must consider this. May I inspect these ships?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You\nhave grown suspicious, Daenerys.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>Always.\n&ldquo;I have grown wise, Xaro.&rdquo; </i></b>- Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>But at the same time, Dany is not\nparanoid, and she knows that she needs to take risks to get what she wants or\nneeds:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;It\nseems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts\neveryone. Every man I take into my service is a\u00a0risk, I understand that,\nbut how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such\u00a0risks? Am I to conquer\nWesteros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?&rdquo;</i></b><i> </i>\u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I am glad you\ncame to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.&rdquo; <b>I will not trust you, but I need you. I\nneed your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.</b> </i>- Daenerys III\nADWD</p></blockquote><p>We\ncontinue to see this attitude in all of the books, with good, bad and uncertain\nresults: Dany trusts Barristan, which was a good thing. Despite being warned by\nQuaithe\u2019s prophecies and the prophecies of the House of the Undying, Dany is\nnot paranoid about them. She is aware of the danger from Reznak (who she thinks\nis the perfumed seneschal) and Quentyn (the Sun\u2019s son), the danger from\nsellswords and people in her court, but she tries to make use of everyone even\nthough she doesn\u2019t fully trust them, trying not to be gullible but without\nbeing paranoid.</p><p>Dany\nis very adaptable and respects different cultures, which enables her to survive\ndifferent situations, while her brother fails:</p><blockquote><p><i>Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse\nrearing beneath him as he reined up too hard. &ldquo;You dare!&rdquo; he screamed\nat her. &ldquo;You give commands to me? To me?&rdquo; He vaulted off the horse,\nstumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet.\nHe grabbed her, shook her. &ldquo;Have you forgotten who you are? Look at you.\nLook at you!&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Dany did not need to look. She was\nbarefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest\ngiven her as a bride gift. She looked as though she\u00a0belonged\u00a0here.\nViserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail.</i></b><i> \u2013 </i>Daenerys III AGOT<i></i></p></blockquote><p>She\u2019s\nalso very introspective, capable of reflecting on her experiences and mistakes,\nand always tries to learn and improve. One of the things she tries to improve\nis her magical knowledge:<i></i></p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;I thank you, Mirri Maz\nDuur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for the lessons you have taught me.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;You will not hear me\u00a0scream,&rdquo; Mirri\nresponded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Dany said, &ldquo;but it is not your\nscreams I want, only your life. <b>I\nremember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.</b>&rdquo; \u2013 </i>Daenerys X AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And when Dany\u2019s bloodriders and Ser\nJorah tell Dany to not enter the House of The Undying, Dany tells them that the\nreason she wants to go is to obtain more knowledge:</p><blockquote><p><i>Ser Jorah Mormont gave the merchant prince a sour look.\n&ldquo;Your Grace, remember\u00a0Mirri\u00a0Maz Duur.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Dany said, suddenly decided. &ldquo;<b>I remember that she had knowledge.</b> And\nshe was only a maegi.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys IV ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She tries to improve her military\nknowledge:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany reined in her mare\nand looked across the fields, to where the Yunkish host lay athwart her path. <b>Whitebeard had been teaching her how best\nto\u00a0count the numbers of a foe. &ldquo;Five thousand,&rdquo; she said after a\nmoment.</b> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nloves books, and tries to learn from them:</p><blockquote><p><i>Ser Jorah Mormont\napologized for his gift. &ldquo;It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor\nexile could afford,&rdquo; he said as <b>he\nlaid a small stack of old\u00a0books\u00a0before her. </b>They were histories and\nsongs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue.<b> She thanked\nhim with all her heart. </b>\u2013 Daenerys II AGOT</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cA\u00a0queen\u00a0must\u00a0listen\u00a0to\u00a0all,\u201d[\u2026]\n<b>She had read that in a book.</b>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys I ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ncold,&rdquo; Dany lied. <b>&ldquo;Bring me\nthe\u00a0book\u00a0I was reading last night.&rdquo; She wanted to lose herself\nin the words, in other times and other places. </b>The fat leather-bound volume\nwas full of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms. Children&rsquo;s stories, if\ntruth be told; too simple and fanciful to be true history. All the heroes were\ntall and handsome, and you could tell the traitors by their shifty eyes. Yet\nshe loved them all the same. Last night she had been reading of the three\nprincesses in the red tower, locked away by the king for the crime of being\nbeautiful. \u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Dragons\u00a0are\u00a0fire\u00a0made\u00a0flesh.\nShe had read that in one of the books Ser Jorah had given her as a wedding\ngift.</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;You \u2026 you mean to ride them?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;One of them. <b>All\nI know of dragons is what my brother told me when I was a girl, and some I read\nin\u00a0books</b>, but it is said that even Aegon the Conqueror never dared\nmount Vhagar or Meraxes, nor did his sisters ride Balerion the Black Dread.\nDragons live longer than men, some for hundreds of years, so Balerion had other\nriders after Aegon died \u2026 but no rider ever flew two dragons.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys\nVIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalways tries to listen to people, and use their advice when she lacks the\nnecessary knowledge:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;A\nqueen must listen to all,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;The highborn and the\nlow, the strong and the weak, the noble and the venal. One voice may speak you\nfalse, but in many there is always truth to be found.&rdquo;</i></b><i> She had read that in\na\u00a0book. \u2013 </i>Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The old man had not\nwanted to sail to Astapor; nor did he favor buying this slave army. <b>A queen should hear all sides before\nreaching a\u00a0decision</b>. That was why Dany had brought him with her to the\nPlaza of Pride, not to keep her safe. \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Aggo, Jhoqo, and\nRakharo still serve me.&rdquo; He is playing games with me. Dany could play as\nwell. <b>&ldquo;I am only a young girl and\nknow little of such things, but\u00a0older,\u00a0wiser\u00a0men tell me that to\nhold Meereen I must control its hinterlands, all the land west of Lhazar as far\nsouth as the Yunkish hills.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\nhad no answer for that. If this is\u00a0truly\u00a0what\nmy\u00a0people\u00a0wish, do I have the right to deny it to them?</i></b><i> It was their city\nbefore it was mine, and it is their own lives they\u00a0wish\u00a0to squander.\n&ldquo;I will consider all you&rsquo;ve said. Thank you for your counsel.&rdquo; She\nrose. &ldquo;We will resume on the morrow.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis also very introspective and self critical, always reflecting on her\nexperiences and mistakes, and deciding that she needs to learn how to rule:</p><blockquote><p><i>That morning she\nsummoned her captains and commanders to the garden, rather than descending to\nthe audience chamber. <b>&ldquo;Aegon\u00a0the\nConqueror\u00a0brought fire\u00a0and\u00a0blood\u00a0to Westeros, but afterward\nhe gave them peace, prosperity, and justice. But all I\nhave\u00a0brought\u00a0to Slaver&rsquo;s Bay is death and ruin. I have been more khal\nthan queen, smashing and plundering, then moving on.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You have brought freedom as well,&rdquo; Missandei\npointed out.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Freedom\u00a0to\u00a0starve?&rdquo;\nasked Dany sharply. &ldquo;Freedom\u00a0to die? Am I a dragon, or a harpy?&rdquo;\nAm I mad? Do I have the taint?</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;A dragon,&rdquo; Ser Barristan said with certainty.\n&ldquo;Meereen is not Westeros, Your Grace.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;But\nhow can I rule seven kingdoms if I cannot rule a single city?&rdquo;</i></b><i> He had no answer to\nthat. Dany turned away from them, to gaze out over the city once again. <b>&ldquo;My children need time to heal and\nlearn. My dragons need time to grow and test their wings. And I need the same.\nI will not let this city go the way of Astapor. I will not let the harpy of\nYunkai chain up those I&rsquo;ve freed all over again.&rdquo;</b> She turned back to\nlook at their faces. &ldquo;I will not march.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What will you do\nthen, Khaleesi?&rdquo; asked Rakharo.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; she\nsaid. &ldquo;Rule. And be a queen.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your Grace could not have known\u2014&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I am the\u00a0queen. It was my\nplace to\u00a0know.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She also knows that she needs to\nlearn more about the kingdom that she intends to rule:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>&ldquo;Tell me of this other Daenerys. I know less than I\nshould of the history of my father&rsquo;s kingdom.</b> I never had\na\u00a0maester\u00a0growing up.&rdquo; Only a brother. \u2013 </i>Daenerys VIII ADWD<i></i></p></blockquote><p>This\ngift for self-reflection is something we see constantly in ADWD as well, while\nDany ponders what\u2019s the best course of action in Meereen.</p><p>Dany\nis pragmatic. In Vaes Tolorro, her people don\u2019t want to enter the city out of\nfear, but Dany insists:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I\nfear no\u00a0ghosts. Dragons are more powerful than\u00a0ghosts.&rdquo;<b> And figs\nare more important.</b></i><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>We\ncan also see her pragmatism in relation to war and conquest:</p><blockquote><p><i>The thought of home disquieted her. If her sun-and-stars had\nlived, he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away\nher enemies, but his strength had left the world. Her bloodriders remained,\nsworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the ways of the\nhorselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, they did not\nrule them. <b>Dany had no wish to reduce\nKing&rsquo;s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts. She had supped\nenough on tears. I want to make my kingdom beautiful, to fill it with fat men\nand pretty maids and laughing children. I want my people to smile when they see\nme ride by, the way Viserys said they smiled for my father.</b></i></p><p><b><i>But before she could do that she\nmust\u00a0conquer.</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;My queen,&rdquo; said Arstan, &ldquo;there have been no\nslaves in the Seven Kingdoms for thousands of years. The old gods and the new\nalike hold slavery to be an abomination. Evil. If you should land in Westeros\nat the head of a slave army, many good men will oppose you for no other reason\nthan that. You will do great harm to your cause, and to the honor of your\nHouse.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Yet I must have some\narmy,&rdquo; Dany said. &ldquo;The boy\u00a0Joffrey\u00a0will not give me the\nIron Throne for asking politely.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys\nII ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis politically intelligent. She very easily sees the political consequences of\nRobert\u2019s death (she doesn\u2019t have the full picture, but she very quickly\nunderstands the flaws in her reasoning when Jorah points it out):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Before,\nthe Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo's\u00a0khalasar, a hundred thousand made\nas one by his strength. Now they fly to pieces, even as\nthe\u00a0khalasar\u00a0did after my khal lay dead.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\ncan see Hizdahr\u2019s true intention behind the reopening of the fighting pits, and\nshe\u2019s capable of making an analysis of the political and economic situation\nshe\u2019s in:</p><blockquote><p><i>I need this man, Dany\nreminded herself. <b>Hizdahr was a wealthy\nmerchant with many friends in Meereen, and more across the seas. He had visited\nVolantis, Lys, and Qarth, had kin in Tolos and Elyria, and was even said to\nwield some influence in New Ghis, where the Yunkai'i were trying to stir up\nenmity against Dany and her rule.</b></i><b><i></i></b></p><p><i>And he was rich. Famously and fabulously rich \u2026</i></p><p><b><i>And like to grow richer, if I grant\nhis petition. When Dany had closed the city's\u00a0fighting\u00a0pits, the\nvalue of\u00a0pit\u00a0shares had plummeted. Hizdahr zo Loraq had grabbed them\nup with both hands, and now owned most of the\u00a0fighting\u00a0pits\u00a0in\nMeereen.</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>A brothel. Half of her\nfreedmen were from Yunkai, where the Wise Masters had been famed for training\nbedslaves. The way of the seven sighs. <b>Brothels\nhad sprouted up like mushrooms all over Meereen.

Food was more costly every day, whilst the price of flesh grew\ncheaper. </b>In the poorer districts between the stepped pyramids of Meereen&rsquo;s\nslaver nobility, there were brothels catering to every conceivable erotic\ntaste, she knew. - Daenerys I ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands supply and demand:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI\nam trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in\nthe\u00a0world.&ldquo;</i></b><i>\nDany smiled at him sweetly. <b>&quot;It\nseems to me that one-third of all the\u00a0ships\u00a0in\nthe\u00a0world\u00a0would be fair.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands the need to compromise, and that it\u2019s not enough to conquer a city,\nshe also needs to win over the people:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>To\nrule Meereen I must win the Meereenese, however much I may despise them.</i></b><i> - Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands\nthat she needs to be careful about keeping up appearances and manipulating how\nother people perceive her:</p><blockquote><p><i>That was\nDrogon's\u00a0victory, not mine, Dany wanted to say, but she held her tongue. <b>The Dothraki would esteem her all the more\nfor a few bells in her hair. </b>\u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Whitebeard,&rdquo;\nshe said, <b>&ldquo;I want\nyour\u00a0counsel, and you should never fear to speak your mind with me &hellip;\nwhen we are alone.

The\nrest\u2014her warriors, such as they were\u2014rode outside</b> and moved their dismal\nherd along, the hundred-odd gaunt horses that had survived\nboth\u00a0red\u00a0waste\u00a0and black salt sea. \u2013 Daenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>She thinks a ruler must keep a cool head and be merciful:<br/></p><blockquote><p>If I wed Hizdahr, will that turn Skahaz against me? She trusted Skahaz more than she trusted Hizdahr, but <b>the Shavepate would be a disaster as a king. He was too quick to anger, too slow to forgive. </b>- Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands that she needs to be seen caring for her people:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Go if you wish,\nser. I will not detain you. I will not detain any of you.&rdquo; Dany vaulted\ndown from the horse. <b>&ldquo;I cannot heal\nthem, but I can show them that their Mother cares.&rdquo;</b> - Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>But even though she has to keep up\nappearances, she tries to be just:</p><blockquote><p><i>Her name had been\u00a0Hazzea. She was four years old.\nUnless her father lied. He might have lied. No one had seen the dragon but him.\nHis proof was burned bones, but burned bones proved nothing. He might have\nkilled the little girl himself, and burned her afterward. He would not have\nbeen the first father to dispose of an unwanted girl child, the Shavepate\nclaimed. The Sons of the Harpy might have done it, and made it look like\ndragon&rsquo;s work to make the city hate me. Dany wanted to believe that \u2026 but if\nthat was so, why had Hazzea&rsquo;s father waited until the audience hall was almost\nempty to come forward? If his purpose had been to inflame the Meereenese\nagainst her, he would have told his tale when the hall was full of ears to\nhear.</i></p><p><i>The Shavepate had urged her to put the man to death.\n&ldquo;At least rip out his tongue. This man&rsquo;s lie could destroy us all,\nMagnificence.&rdquo; Instead Dany chose to pay the blood price. No one could\ntell her the worth of a daughter, so she set it at one hundred times the worth\nof a lamb. <b>&ldquo;I would give Hazzea back to you if I could,&rdquo; she told the\nfather, &ldquo;but some things are beyond the power of even a queen. Her bones shall be laid to rest in the\nTemple of the Graces, and a hundred candles shall burn day and night in her\nmemory. Come back to me each year upon her nameday, and your other children\nshall not want \u2026 but this tale must never pass your lips again.&rdquo; </b>\u2013\nDaenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This quote shows that Dany is smart\nand capable of analysing the situation to conclude that Hazzea\u2019s father was\ntelling the truth. She knows that she has to keep the tale from spreading, but\nshe also understands that it\u2019s important to be fair to her people, so she\nchooses to be kind and be just to Hazzea\u2019s father.</p><p>With all of this being said, I think\nDany has many qualities of a great ruler.</p><p><b>DANY\u2019S CHANGING POLITICAL VIEWS</b></p><p>Thanks to Dany\u2019s ability for\nself-reflection, Dany changes her political views throughout the story due to\nher experiences. She starts the story as a very na\u00efve girl who doesn\u2019t truly\nunderstands the costs of war and conquest, asking her husband to invade the\nSeven Kingdoms without really realizing what the consequences would be. First,\nshe tries to convince Drogo several times, unsuccessfully. Then, the wineseller tries to\npoison her and Drogo decides to cross the narrow sea. He attacks the Lhazareen\nto pay for the ships, and Dany finally sees the consequences of her actions:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>Slaves, Dany thought.</b>\nKhal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver&rsquo;s Bay. <b>She\nwanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. This is war, this\nis what it looks like, this is the price of the\u00a0Iron\u00a0Throne.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys VII AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>But\nDany is unable to ignore the horror, and two paragraphs later, she tries to put\na stop at least to the rapes, with the little power she has. She defies\nDothraki culture and Drogo\u2019s men, putting herself at risk:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Behind\u00a0them,\nthe girl being raped made a heartrending sound,</i></b><i> a long sobbing wail\nthat went on and on and on. Dany&rsquo;s hand clenched hard around the reins, and she\nturned the silver&rsquo;s head. <b>&ldquo;Make\u00a0them\u00a0stop,&rdquo;\nshe commanded Ser Jorah.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VII AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>Later, Dany reflects on what she\nthinks is acceptable in war and conquest, trying to be pragmatic but without\nunnecessary bloodshed:</p><blockquote><p><i>Blood\u00a0and fire, thought Dany. The words of House\nTargaryen. She had known them all her life. <b>&ldquo;The\u00a0blood\u00a0of my enemies I will shed gladly.\nThe\u00a0blood\u00a0of\u00a0innocents\u00a0is another matter.</b> Eight\nthousand Unsullied they would offer me. Eight thousand dead babes. Eight\nthousand strangled dogs.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; she\ncorrected. &ldquo;Prince Rhaegar led free men into battle, not slaves.\nWhitebeard said he dubbed his squires himself, and made many other knights as\nwell.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;There was no higher honor than to receive your\nknighthood from the\u00a0Prince\u00a0of\u00a0Dragonstone.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Tell me, then\u2014when he touched\na man on the shoulder with his sword, what did he say? &lsquo;Go forth and kill the\nweak&rsquo;? Or 'Go forth and defend them&rsquo;?</i></b><i> At the\nTrident, those brave men Viserys spoke of who died beneath our dragon\nbanners\u2014did they give their lives because they believed in Rhaegar&rsquo;s cause, or\nbecause they had been bought and paid for?&rdquo; Dany turned to Mormont,\ncrossed her arms, and waited for an answer. \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Another thing that changes are her\nviews on slavery. Dany starts as someone who lives in a slave society and has\nno strong feelings against slavery. While she was living with Illyrio, she had\nslaves serving her, and with the Dothraki, she had slave servants as well.\nBut as soon as Drogo dies, Dany frees her slaves.<i> </i>Even then, while Dany no longer has slaves herself, she has no\nstrong feelings about the slaves in Qarth, and even considers buying a slave\narmy. But when Dany sees the horrors in Astapor and understands what slavery\ntruly means, she turns away from it:</p><blockquote><p><i>Xaro\u00a0caught it in the air and took a bite. &ldquo;Whence\ncame this madness? Should I count myself fortunate that you did not free my\nown\u00a0slaves\u00a0when you were my guest in Qarth?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>I was a beggar queen and you were Xaro of the Thirteen, Dany\nthought, and all you wanted were my dragons. <b>&ldquo;Your slaves seemed well treated and content. It was not till\nAstapor that my eyes were opened. Do you know how Unsullied are made and\ntrained?&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And despite being raised by Viserys,\nDany was able to think on her on view on what a king should be, and what are\nher duties as a monarch:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I was alone for a long time, Jorah. All alone but for\nmy brother. I was such a small scared thing. <b>Viserys should have protected me, but instead he hurt me and scared me\nworse. He shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. He wasn&rsquo;t just my brother, he was my king.\nWhy do the gods make kings and queens, if not to protect the ones who can&rsquo;t\nprotect themselves?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Some kings make\nthemselves.\u00a0Robert\u00a0did.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He was no true king,&rdquo; Dany said scornfully.\n&ldquo;He did no justice. <b>Justice &hellip;\nthat&rsquo;s what kings are for.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>A\u00a0queen\u00a0belongs\u00a0not\nto herself but to her people.</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys was only able to change her\nviews and become a more conscious ruler because of her self-reflection and\nempathy, and this is one of the things that sets her apart as a leader. With\nall that being said, let\u2019s see Dany\u2019s journey in each of the books.</p><p><b>FINDING HER WAY IN THE WORLD</b></p><p>The first two books are, in my\nopinion, about Daenerys finding out what she wants and what to do. It\u2019s the\nbeginning of her journey as a leader, and she\u2019s going on instinct, trying to\nfind out what to do.</p><p><b>A GAME OF THRONES</b></p><p>People usually look at this book as\nthe story of a scared little girl overcoming abuse and becoming stronger. This\nis all true, but this is also the book where Dany starts to develop her\nleadership skills. In this book, Dany learns how to be more assertive and how\nto deal with this new authority that is given to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo;\nDany told Ser Jorah. <b>&ldquo;Tell them all\nto stay. Tell them I command it.&rdquo;</b></i><i></i></p><p><i>The knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had\na neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and\nchest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his smiles gave\nDany comfort. <b>&ldquo;You are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Not a\u00a0queen,&rdquo; said Dany.\n&ldquo;A\u00a0khaleesi.&rdquo; </b>She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the\nridge alone. \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>Unlike Viserys, Dany learns about\nDothraki culture and adapts to it. This allows her to gain more respect than\nher brother:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Take</b>\u00a0<b>his</b>\u00a0<b>horse</b>,&rdquo;\nDany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he\nwas hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words\ncame. <b>&ldquo;Let my brother walk behind\nus back to the khalasar.&rdquo; Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride\nwas no man at all, the lowest of the low, without honor or pride. &ldquo;Let\neveryone see him as he is.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany understands that Dothraki\nculture strongly associates strength with the ability to ride. So she makes a\nconscious choice to show all of the khalasar what Viserys really is, showing\nherself stronger than her brother. And we start to see just how much Viserys\nignorance is detrimental to his potential ability to lead the Dothraki:</p><blockquote><p><i>(\u2026) <b>the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal\nRhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King. Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the\nnext day, and Viserys had accepted. In his stubborn ignorance, he had not even\nknown he was being mocked</b>; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women\ngiving birth, the very young and the very old. That won him yet another name:\nKhal\u00a0Rhaggat, the Cart King. Her brother had thought it was the khal&rsquo;s way\nof apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah not to\ntell him the truth, lest he be shamed. \u2013 </i>Daenerys\nIV AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Because Viserys refuses to learn and\nadapt to other cultures, he loses respects, while Dany gains the respect of the\nDothraki. She respects their culture and shows her strength by eating the\nstallion\u2019s horse, riding with them until the end of her pregnancy, and\nasserting herself.</p><p>This new authority that Dany gains\nalso means that Dany sees herself more and more free of her brother\u2019s\ninfluence. She gets the chance of getting a new perspective on Westeros through\nJorah, without her brother\u2019s biases:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;The common people pray for\nrain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,&rdquo;</i></b><i> Ser Jorah told her. <b>&ldquo;It\nis no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as\nthey are left in peace.&rdquo; </b>He gave a shrug. <b>&ldquo;They never are.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a\npuzzle box. <b>It went against everything\nthat Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little\nwhether a true\u00a0king\u00a0or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she\nthought on Jorah&rsquo;s words, the more they rang of truth. </b>\u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>She talks with Jorah about if it\nwould be possible for the Dothraki to conquer Westeros, trying to gather the\ninformation that she\u2019ll need, and even starts believing that someone else could\nconquer the Seven Kingdoms (herself):</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany could not pretend\nto surprise at the disdain in his tone. </i><b><i>&ldquo;What\n\u2026 what if it were not Viserys?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;If it were someone else\nwho led them? Someone stronger? Could the Dothraki\u00a0truly\u00a0conquer\u00a0the\u00a0Seven\u00a0Kingdoms?&rdquo;</i> </b>- Daenerys IV AGOT<b><i></i></b></p></blockquote><p>This is also the book in which Dany\nstarts dealing with the many moral dilemmas that she encounters in her story:\nshe wants to conquer the Seven Kingdoms, but once she sees that Drogo attacks\nthe Lhazareen to fund the invasion, she sees the costs of war for the first\ntime, and stands up to Drogo\u2019s men to protect the women from being raped.\nLater, after Drogo dies, Dany frees her slaves and asks people to follow her,\npromising to protect them and care for them:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;You will be my khalasar,&rdquo; she told them. <b>&ldquo;I see the faces of\u00a0slaves. I\nfree you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one shall harm you. If you\nstay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.&rdquo;</b> The\nblack eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. &ldquo;I see the children, women,\nthe wrinkled faces of the aged. I was a child yesterday. Today I am a woman.\nTomorrow I will be old. <b>To each of you I\nsay, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for\nyou.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys X AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>But it\u2019s important to note that even\nthough Dany has more power than she starts the book with, for most of the book,\nthe power is not truly hers, it comes from Drogo. Before Dany hatches her\ndragons, she has to use Drogo\u2019s name to make herself be obeyed, and has to\nresort to things like bed tricks. Even then, she is not always successful. I\nthink it\u2019s very interesting that before Dany truly has her own power, she has\nto deal with what any woman would have to deal \u2013 trying to manipulate her\nhusband to have power and get what she wants. It\u2019s only at the end of the book\nthat Dany steps up as khaleesi in her own right. Initially, Aggo, Jhogo and\nRakharo refuse to follow her because she\u2019s a woman, but Dany insists, because\nshe knows that when she steps out of the fire and shows her strength, the\nkhalasar will follow her:</p><blockquote><p><i>Wordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her khas\ncame up behind him. Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet.\n&ldquo;Blood of my blood,&rdquo; he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking\nearth. &ldquo;Blood of my blood,&rdquo; she heard Aggo echo. &ldquo;Blood of my\nblood,&rdquo; Rakharo shouted.</i></p><p><i>And after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all\nthe Dothraki, men and women and children, and <b>Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now,\ntoday and tomorrow and\u00a0forever, hers as they had never been Drogo&rsquo;s.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys X AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>A Game of Thrones is an essential\npart of Dany\u2019s growth as a leader. She learns that to be respected and\naccepted, she needs to integrate into the community and understand the culture\nthat she is in. She gains a new perspective on Westeros and on war, frees\nherself from Viserys\u2019 abuse, and builds the necessary strength and confidence\nto lead her people in the future.</p><p><b>A CLASH OF KINGS</b></p><p>Now, for the first time in her life,\nDany has power on her own, and people look up to her for guidance. To survive\nthe Red Waste, Dany leads by showing an example of strength:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>They\nare not strong, she told herself, so\u00a0I\u00a0must\u00a0be their\u00a0strength.</i></b><i>\u00a0<b>I\u00a0must\u00a0show no fear, no weakness,\nno doubt.</b> However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face\nthey\u00a0must\u00a0see only Drogo&rsquo;s queen. She felt older than her fourteen\nyears. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was done. \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nkeeps her people together by respecting their culture and traditions:</p><blockquote><p><i>Three days into the march, the first man died. A toothless\noldster with cloudy blue eyes, he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not\nrise again. An hour later he was done. Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and\ncarried his ill luck to the living. &ldquo;His time was past,&rdquo; her handmaid\nIrri declared. &ldquo;No man should live longer than his teeth.&rdquo; The others\nagreed. <b>Dany bid them kill the weakest\nof their dying\u00a0horses, so the dead man might go mounted into the night\nlands.</b></i></p><p><i>Two nights later, it was an infant girl who perished. Her\nmother&rsquo;s anguished wailing lasted all day, but there was nothing to be done. <b>The child had been too young to ride, poor\nthing. Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands; she must be born\nagain.</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She also leads them and keeps them\ntogether by showing that she cares about them. She doesn\u2019t see herself above\nher people, and because of this, she starves with them and cares for them:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\nhungered and thirsted with the rest of them.</i></b><i> The milk in her breasts dried up, her nipples\ncracked and bled, and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was\nlean and hard as a stick, yet it was her dragons she feared for.\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Doreah\u00a0took a\nfever and grew worse with every league they crossed. Her lips and hands broke\nwith blood blisters, her hair came out in clumps, and one evenfall she lacked\nthe strength to mount her horse. Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to\nher saddle, but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea, when the Lysene\ngirl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more. <b>She gave\u00a0Doreah\u00a0water from her\nown skin, cooled her brow with a damp cloth, and held her hand until she died,\nshivering. Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on.</b> \u2013 Daenerys\nI ACOK</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>She keeps them alive by being\npragmatic, like when she insists in entering the abandoned city, breaking the\ntaboo of the Dothraki against such places because they need food:</p><blockquote><p><i>Other searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees,\nhidden behind closed doors in secret gardens. Aggo showed her a courtyard\novergrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes, and Jhogo discovered a\nwell where the water was pure and cold. Yet they found bones too, the skulls of\nthe unburied dead, bleached and broken. &ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; Irri muttered.\n&ldquo;Terrible ghosts. We must not stay here, Khaleesi, this is their\nplace.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I fear no ghosts. Dragons are\nmore powerful than ghosts.&rdquo; And\u00a0figs\u00a0are more important.</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>And she saves her people by making\nthe sensible choice of sending her bloodriders in different directions to find\na way out of the desert:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;What shall we seek, Khaleesi?&rdquo; asked Jhogo.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Whatever there is,&rdquo; Dany answered. &ldquo;Seek for\nother\u00a0cities, living and dead. Seek for caravans and people. Seek for\nrivers and lakes and the great salt sea. Find how far this waste extends before\nus, and what lies on the other side. <b>When\nI leave this place, I do not mean to strike out blind again. I will know where\nI am bound, and how best to get there.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>All of these actions enabled her to\nkeep her khalasar together and keep their loyalty. And after many deaths and\nsuffering, they finally get to Qarth.</p><p>But when they arrive in Qarth, there\nare more challenges. Dany thinks that she\u2019ll find something in the city:</p><blockquote><p><i>The\u00a0Bleeding\u00a0Star\u00a0led\nme to Qarth for a purpose. <b>Here I will\nfind what I need, if I have the strength to take what is offered, and the\nwisdom to avoid the traps and snares.</b> If the gods mean for me to conquer,\nthey will provide, they will send me a sign, and if not &hellip; if not &hellip; \u2013\nDaenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>And this quote establishes Dany\u2019s\narc in this book very well, because this part of her story is a test for\nher as a leader, and she learns some important lessons. She has to escape\ndifferent deceptions, and Dany is careful about that. Even with all their\nflatteries, she doesn\u2019t trust Xaro and Pyat Pree, and takes precautions against\nthem:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I do not understand her.&rdquo; Pyat and Xaro had\nshowered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her\u00a0dragons,\ndeclaring themselves her loyal servants in all things, but from Quaithe she had\ngotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never seen\nthe woman&rsquo;s face. Remember Mirri Maz Duur, she told herself. <b>Remember treachery. She turned to her\nbloodriders. &ldquo;We will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that\nno one enters this wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that\nthe\u00a0dragons\u00a0are always well\u00a0guarded.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It shall be done, Khaleesi,&rdquo; Aggo said.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;We have seen only the parts of\nQarth that\u00a0Pyat\u00a0Pree wished us to see,&rdquo; she went on.\n&ldquo;Rakharo, go forth and look on the rest, and tell me what you find. Take\ngood men with you\u2014and women, to go places where men are forbidden.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;As you say, I do, blood of my blood,&rdquo; said\nRakharo.</i>\n\u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Later,\nDany also escapes treachery by refusing to fall for Xaro\u2019s bad deal (he had\noffered her 30 ships for one dragon):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI\nam trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in\nthe\u00a0world.&ldquo; Dany smiled at him sweetly. &quot;It seems to me that\none-third of all the\u00a0ships\u00a0in the\u00a0world\u00a0would be\nfair.&rdquo;</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso sends Jorah to find out about news from Westeros and to find ships that\ncould take them:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Ser\nJorah, find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor. It has been\nhalf a year since I last heard tidings from the Seven Kingdoms. Perhaps the\ngods will have blown some good captain here from Westeros with a ship to carry\nus home.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>The knight frowned. &ldquo;That would be no kindness. The\nUsurper will kill you, sure as sunrise.&rdquo; Mormont hooked his thumbs through\nhis swordbelt. &ldquo;My\u00a0place\u00a0is here at\u00a0your\u00a0side.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Jhogo can guard me as well. <b>You have more languages than my bloodriders, and the Dothraki mistrust\nthe sea and those who sail her. Only you can serve me in this.</b> Go among the\nships and speak to the crews, learn where they are from and where they are\nbound and what manner of men command them.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>The interesting thing here is that\nDany can see the strengths in each of her men and can use them accordingly. She\nknows that Ser Jorah is the most adequate person to entrust this task to, and\nthis shows her abilities as a leader, because a leader must know the people under her command.</p><p>Dany is not only trying to escape\ndeception, but she\u2019s also trying to get help to conquer Westeros. She tries to\nbribe the Pureborn and follow Qartheen traditions, but it doesn\u2019t work. Soon,\nDany starts to realize that she won\u2019t find help to conquer Westeros as a beggar:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Yet\neven crowned, I am a\u00a0beggar\u00a0still, Dany thought.</i></b><i> I have become the most\nsplendid\u00a0beggar\u00a0in the world, but a\u00a0beggar\u00a0all the same.\nShe hated it, as her brother must have. All those years of running from city to\ncity one step ahead of the Usurper&rsquo;s knives, pleading for help from archons and\nprinces and magisters, buying our food with flattery. He must have known how\nthey mocked him. Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter. In the end it had\ndriven him mad. It will do the same to me if I let it. Part of her would have\nliked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro, and make the\ndead city bloom. No, that is defeat. I have something Viserys never had. I have\nthe dragons. The dragons are all the difference. \u2013 Daenerys III ACOK</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Qarth is also important for Dany\u2019s\narc as a leader because it\u2019s a place of temptation. Qarth is a city filled with\nsplendors: it\u2019s beautiful, it has magic, it\u2019s wealthy. And both Xaro and Pyat\nPree are offering them to Dany. If she stays with Pyat Pree, she will have\nsorceries and magical knowledge at her disposal. If she stays with Xaro, she\nwill be a wealthy woman for the rest of her life. But if she does that, she\nwill have to stay in Qarth forever and will never achieve her true desire, to\ngo home to Westeros. This is a moment in her arc in which Dany has to decide\nwhat she truly wants: does she want a life of luxury or does she want to pursue\na greater destiny for herself? In the end, Dany decides to leave Qarth and make\nher own path.</p><p>In this book, Dany has successfully\nled her people through the desert through strength, pragmatism and determination, and has\nescaped Qarth because of her cleverness. She has also finally decided what she\nwants for herself:</p><blockquote><p><i>Three heads has the dragon, Dany thought, wondering. <b>&ldquo;I shall tell my people to make ready\nto depart at once. But the ships that bring me home must bear different\nnames.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; said Arstan.\n&ldquo;What\u00a0names\u00a0would you\u00a0prefer?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Vhagar,&rdquo; Daenerys told\nhim. &ldquo;Meraxes. And Balerion. Paint the names on their hulls in golden\nletters three feet high, Arstan. I want every man who sees them to know the\ndragons are returned.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p><b>SHAPING THE WORLD</b></p><p>The\nthird and fifth book are the ones in which Dany starts to more actively shape\nthe world around her. While in the first two books, Dany is leading through her\nstrength, adaptation to culture, instinct and pragmatism, now she finally\nstarts to deal with more complex issues. She no longer leads a small khalasar \u2013\nshe has to deal with big armies and thousands of different and diverse people.\nShe\u2019s no longer just defying Dothraki tradition \u2013 she is fighting against a\ncontinent wide system of slavery. She has to deal with military strategy, food,\ntrade, diplomacy, peace and war, and this is the moment in which Dany grows the\nmost, reflects on what is means to be a ruler, and on what it means to be a revolutionary.</p><p><b>A STORM OF SWORDS</b></p><p>In\nthis book, we see both Dany\u2019s brilliance and inexperience. She has huge\nvictories, but also makes huge mistakes.</p><p>The\nbook starts with Dany going to Illyrio, until Jorah points out that going there\nwithout an army would be risky. He convinces Dany to go to Astapor to buy the\nUnsullied. There, she sees the horrors of slavery and decides to start her\nliberation of the slaves.</p><p>In\neach of the cities, Dany makes brilliant plans. In Astapor, Dany pretends that\nshe doesn\u2019t speak Valyrian, at Ser Jorah\u2019s suggestion, to get to hear what\nKraznis doesn\u2019t want her to hear. But she also sets in motion a plan that she\ncreates all on her own: she asks Jorah how Astapor is defended, and later asks\nMissandei if the things Kraznis told her were true, to get more information\nbefore she acts. Then, she uses a Qartheen dress look more wealthy, and\nsuccessfully negotiates with the slavers, managing to buy all of the Unsullied\nso that her plan can work. She refuses to let Ser Barristan undermine her,\nordering him to be taken away from her presence when he speaks out of turn.\nWhile setting her plan in motion, she dresses in Dothraki clothes and puts the\nweakest of her people inside the column, with the warriors outside, in order to\nappear more intimidating. And before she turns on the masters, she makes sure\nto tell the Unsullied that she has paid for them, and they belong to her now,\nso that they know they no longer have to be loyal to the Astapori masters. It\nwas a very risky plan, and if it failed, Dany and all of her people would have\ndied. But Dany took all the steps necessary for it to be a success.</p><p>In\nYunkai, she tells the sellswords that she wants answers to her offers on the\nnext day, gives the Second Sons wine to get them drunk, and tells the Yukish\nenvoy that they have three days to think. Then, she organizes a surprise\nattack, defeating the sellsword companies almost with no bloodshed and with\neven fewer losses on her side.</p><p>In\nMeereen, Dany doesn\u2019t have surprise on her side, since the Meereenese have come\nto expect an attack and hid behind their walls. She understands the necessity\nof facing Meereen\u2019s champion (\u201cIf I\u00a0ignore\u00a0this any longer, my own\npeople will think me\u00a0weak\u201d \u2013 Daenerys V ASOS), but carefully chooses who\nwill face this champion:</p><blockquote><p><b>Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo were brave warriors, but they were young, and too valuable to risk. They kept her khalasar together, and were her best scouts too.</b> - Daenerys V ASOS<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his city I want, not his meager manhood.&rdquo; She was growing angry, however. <b>If I ignore this any longer, my own people will think me weak.</b> <b>Yet who could she send? She needed Daario as much as she did her bloodriders. Without the flamboyant Tyroshi, she had no hold on the Stormcrows, </b>many of whom had been followers of Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor the Bald. - Daenerys V ASOS<br/></p></blockquote><p>Once again, Dany shows\nherself as a capable leader, one that understands the importance and strengths\nof each men under her command. So she ends up sending Belwas, reasoning that:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Strong\u00a0Belwas\u00a0was\na slave here in the fighting pits. <b>If this\u00a0highborn\u00a0Oznak should fall\nto such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if he wins &hellip; well, it is a\npoor victory for one so noble</b>, one that Meereen can take no pride in.&rdquo; <b>And\nunlike Ser Jorah, Daario, Brown Ben, and her three bloodriders, the eunuch did\nnot lead troops, plan battles, or give her counsel. </b>He does nothing but eat and\nboast and bellow at Arstan.\u00a0<b>Belwas\u00a0was the man she could most easily\nspare. And it was time she learned what sort of protector Magister Illyrio had\nsent her.</b> </i>\u2013 Daenerys V ASOS</p></blockquote><p>She\nalso takes care of Belwas, which is good to show her people that she cares\nabout them. But this is not enough to take the city, of course. The Meereenese\nburnt all the trees, so Dany can\u2019t build siege weapons. There are heads of harpies\nabove the gates to pour boiling oil, and she doesn\u2019t have enough food to feed\nher people (and can\u2019t take it from land, since the slavers burned the trees). Her\nadvisors tell her to leave Meereen behind and go to Westeros, and let her\npeople starve on the march. But Dany refuses to leave her people to die, and\nshe refuses to unnecessarily waste the lives of the Unsullied to assault the\nwalls under attack of boiling oil. Instead, Dany shows her resourcefulness \u2013\nshe makes siege weapons out of the ships that Illyrio sent her, and sends\nsoldiers to strike the chains of the slaves in the pits so they could also help\nher take the city from within.</p><p>Dany\nproves herself to be very intelligent, showing creativeness, resourcefulness,\nunderstanding of the different people that serve her and how each can be useful\nfor her, understanding of the need to keep up appearances and manipulate\npeople\u2019s perceptions, and showing that she cares for her people. But\nintelligence alone isn\u2019t enough. This book is also the one in which we see how\nher naivety, inexperience and lack of education impacts badly on her, and leads\nher to make mistakes.</p><p>In\nAstapor, she doesn\u2019t leave any army behind to protect the city. Because of\nthat, the council that she left governing is easily overthrown by the Butcher\nKing. In Yunkai, she doesn\u2019t really conquer the city, and leaves the masters\nstill in power. Then, as soon as she leaves, the masters enslave everyone\nagain. These mistakes also have serious consequences for Dany\u2019s future reign in\nMeereen: because of them, Dany will later have to deal with Astapori refugees, a plague, and with the city of Yunkai making alliances against her and besieging her\ncity.</p><p>These\nare mistakes that show her inexperience, and lack of formal education, but they\nalso show that Dany had bad advisors: both Jorah and Barristan don\u2019t really\ncare about Dany\u2019s anti-slavery campaign. They constantly tell her that she has\nnothing to gain here, and that she should just go to Westeros. Because none of\nthem is interested in ending slavery, they don\u2019t warn Dany about the mistakes\nthat she is making: they don\u2019t advise her to leave an army in Astapor, and they\ndon\u2019t tell her what\u2019s going to happen when she leaves Yunkai. Both of them are\nmore educated and experienced than her, and yet they tell her nothing.</p><p>Another\nthing that has consequences in the future is the question of bad faith. Dany\ndoes care about being honorable and upholding certain deals:</p><blockquote><p><i>Strong Belwas drew his\narakh. &ldquo;Strong Belwas will give his ugly tongue to the little queen, if\nshe likes.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No,\nBelwas. I have given these men my safe conduct.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>But at the same time, Dany\u2019s battle plans in Astapor and\nYunkai both involved deceit, and she also uses her dragons to intimidate an\nenvoy. This deceit was necessary, though: Dany starts with no army, and she\u2019s\nat a disadvantage when dealing with the slavers. It was certainly the right\nthing to do, and the best she could do in her circumstances. But of course, it\nwill still have consequences in the future, during her efforts to make peace,\nbecause the slavers don\u2019t trust her:<i></i></p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Ah, there is the thorn in the bower, my queen,&rdquo;\nsaid Hizdahr zo Loraq. <b>&ldquo;Sad to say,\nYunkai has no faith in your promises. They keep plucking the same string on the\nharp, about some envoy that your dragons set on fire.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Only his\u00a0tokar\u00a0was\u00a0burned,&rdquo; said\nDany scornfully.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Be that as it may, they do not\ntrust you.</i></b><i> The men of New Ghis feel the same.\nWords are wind, as you yourself have so oft said. No words of yours will secure\nthis peace for Meereen. Your foes require deeds. They would see us wed, and\nthey would see me crowned as king, to rule beside you.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys\ncan\u2019t unmake her mistakes. But thankfully, she learns from them. She refuses\nto leave Meereen behind, like she did in Astapor and Yunkai. And later in the\nnext book, Dany is very mindful of what might happen to her city if she takes\nher army away, showing that she learned from her mistake in Astapor:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I know that the Mother of Dragons will not abandon us\nin our hour of peril. Lend us your Unsullied to defend our walls.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>And if I do, who\nwill\u00a0defend\u00a0my\u00a0walls?</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys\nIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Westeros.\nHome. But if she left, what would happen to her city?</i></b><i> - Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Meet the\nfoe,&rdquo; she echoed, &ldquo;with the freedmen you&rsquo;ve called half-trained and\nunblooded.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We were all\nunblooded once, Your Grace. The Unsullied will help stiffen them. If I had five\nhundred knights \u2026&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Or\nfive. And if I give you the Unsullied, I will have no one but the Brazen Beasts\nto hold Meereen.&rdquo;</i></b><i>\nWhen Ser Barristan did not dispute her, Dany closed her eyes. Gods, she prayed,\nyou took Khal Drogo, who was my sun-and-stars. You took our valiant son before\nhe drew a breath. You have had your blood of me. Help me now, I pray you. Give\nme the wisdom to see the path ahead and the strength to do what I must to keep\nmy children safe. - Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso understands her mistakes in leaving Yunkai untaken and leaving the masters\nin power:</p><blockquote><p><i>His new Unsullied are\nan obscene jape. &ldquo;King Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens and let\nthe Yunkai'i tend theirs.&rdquo; It was not that Dany harbored any love\nfor\u00a0Yunkai. <b>She was coming to\nregret leaving the Yellow City untaken after defeating its army in the field.\nThe Wise Masters had returned to slaving as soon as she moved on, and were busy\nraising levies, hiring sellswords, and making alliances against her.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Overall, I think this book is great\nto show us just how smart Dany is: she seeks different sources of information\nin Astapor, listens to Ser Barristan\u2019s lessons in military matters, makes\nbrilliant plans that minimize bloodshed, knows her men and how to use each of\nthem, and punishes rapists and murderers in her army after the sack of Meereen.\nBut this book also strips Dany of her initial naivety, and she realizes that\nconquering and ruling are not the same thing. She realizes that she needs\nexperience. And we see, once again, one of Dany\u2019s greatest qualities: her\nself-reflection and willingness to learn. She decides to stay, learn how to be\na ruler and take responsibility for her actions.</p><p><b>A DANCE WITH DRAGONS</b></p><p>ASOS\nis, in my opinion, the book in which Dany makes the most mistakes, leading to\nthe consequences that I already described. But I also think that we shouldn\u2019t\nlook at her mistakes in ASOS and say that this means that Dany is an awful\nruler. Because it\u2019s more than understandable why she makes these mistakes. She\nhas no education or experience. It would be unrealistic if she knew everything\nshe had to do from the start.</p><p>So\nin ADWD, Dany has to deal with the mistakes she has already made, because she\ncan\u2019t unmake them, she can\u2019t go back in time to fix them. She also has to deal\nwith a lot of situations that are completely out of her control. In my opinion,\nwhile Dany made big mistakes in Astapor and Yunkai, she dealt very well with\nthe situation in Meereen, considering her circumstances. So let\u2019s dive into it.\nMeereen\u2019s storyline is very complex, so I\u2019ll deal with different aspects of it\nin different sections.</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b><br/></li></ul><p>People\ncriticize Daenerys for several things: because \u201cshe destroyed the economy\u201d,\nbecause \u201cshe should have a plan before she took the city to stop the economy\nfrom collapsing\u201d and \u201cshe didn\u2019t do anything to establish a new economy without\nslavery\u201d. So let\u2019s address these criticisms.</p><p><b>\u201cShe destroyed the\neconomy\u201d</b></p><p>Let\u2019s\nlook at everything we know about Meereen\u2019s economy:</p><p>Their\nmain export are slaves. Astapor produces soldiers, Yunkai produces bed slaves,\nand Meereen produces bedslaves, teachers and artisans.</p><p>Aside\nfrom slaves, Meereen also has olives, salt, wine and copper. In the\nhinterlands, slaves grow wheat and olives, herd sheep and goats, and mine salt\nand copper. But even though Meereen produces other things beyond slaves, they\nare not enough to sustain the economy, and Meereen\u2019s economy is based mostly on\nslavery:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Without\nslaves,\u00a0Meereen\u00a0had little to offer traders. </i></b><i>\u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>When\nDany ends slavery, this means that she no longer has slaves to sell. And the\nslavers burnt the olive trees and the best grape arbors before Dany came into\nthe city to stop her from building siege weapons. Copper is not a very valuable\nmetal and Meereen\u2019s wine is of an inferior vintage.</p><p>These\nthings aren\u2019t Dany\u2019s fault. Meereen didn\u2019t have a lot of things to trade aside\nfrom slaves, and she couldn\u2019t stop the masters from burning the olive trees and\nthe grape arbors. This means that Meereen\u2019s economy was already very poor (it was rich because of slavery, but poor in other things) before Dany even conquered the city.</p><p>And\nthere\u2019s also the fact that Dany is not the kind of person to leave her people\nbehind, so she lets the former slaves from Astapor and Yunkai come with her,\nwhich also means that she has more mouths to feed.</p><p>If\nDaenerys wants to end slavery, there\u2019s nothing she can do about the fact that\nthe economy will suffer if she no longer has slaves to sell. </p><p>There\nare also some problems that came with Dany\u2019s mistakes in Yunkai and Astapor.\nThe fact that Dany didn\u2019t take the masters out of power in Yunkai meant that,\nas soon as Dany left, they reenslaved people, and decided to attack Dany in\nMeereen, putting her city under siege. The Yunkish army surrounded her city\nfrom land, and Qartheen ships closed the bay, so she can\u2019t get trade, and\nfishers can\u2019t go into the bay. This is partly because of Dany\u2019s mistakes,\nbecause she left the masters of Yunkai in power. But as I\u2019ve said, Dany can\u2019t\ngo back in time to fix those mistakes, she can only deal with the consequences. And Dany would have to face opposition no\nmatter what she did. The powers of Essos would not simply accept Dany freeing\ntheir slaves and ruining their economy, and Dany also poses a symbolical\nthreat. So most likely, the economy of the city would suffer because of the war\nagainst the slavers, no matter what Dany did.</p><p>Ending\nslavery means disrupting the economy, there\u2019s no way around it.</p><p><b>\u201cShe should have a plan\nbefore she took the city to stop the economy from collapsing\u201d</b></p><p>I\u2019ve\nseen people suggest that Dany should have ended slavery gradually, or that she\nshould have waited to end slavery, so that she could first build a new economy,\nand only later free the slaves. But there are practical and ethical problems\nwith these suggestions.</p><p>Dany\nused the help of the slaves to take the city. While Dany was trying to take the\ncity from the outside, the slaves rose in revolt from the inside. Dany even\nsends part of her men to strike off the chains of the slaves in the fighting\npits. After taking the city with their help, Dany can\u2019t just tell the slaves\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to free you because of the economy, so you will have to wait\u201d.\nIf she did that, she would turn the slaves against her, and she would have both\nslaves and slavers trying to overthrow her. And if she did wait to free the\nslaves, she would probably have to compromise more with the slavers to be able\nto rule, and this would make it impossible for her to free the slaves later.</p><p>Besides,\n\u201cending slavery gradually\u201d is just inhumane. Take into consideration that every\nday, slaves are being raped, tortured, mutilated and overworked. If you think\nthat Daenerys should have ended slavery gradually, so that she could preserve\nthe economy and end slavery \u201cpeacefully\u201d, that only means that you care more\nabout the lives of the slavers and their livelihood than you care about the\nslaves.</p><p><b>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything\nto establish a new economy without slavery\u201d</b></p><p>Another\nbaseless accusation. Dany does a lot to rebuild Meereen\u2019s economy. She plants\nbeans, grapes, olives and wheat. She sends her khalasar to conquer the\nhinterlands and free the slaves there, and these former slaves are also\nplanting and bringing their crops to Meereen. The Green Grace had told Dany\nthat the soil of Meereen became infertile after the wars with the Valyrians, so\nshe starts to build a ditch to bring water to the plantations, showing how Dany\nis resourceful and how she is thinking in the long term, working on the\ninfrastructure of the city to make it agriculturally independent. She also\nsends Daario to Lhazar, to reopen the overland trade routes and bring grains\ninto the city. She negotiates with Xaro, hoping to trade the few things that Meereen\nhas to offer. And when the city is put under siege, Dany compromises and\nmarries Hizdahr, so that the siege can be lifted and she can have trade again.\nShe also has to deal with things like guilds of artisans, that don\u2019t want to\nallow freedmen into their business, so Dany has to demand that they open their\nrolls to the freedmen.</p><p>But\neven all of those things are not enough, because some things are simply\nimpossible. She can&rsquo;t make crops grow overnight and she doesn&rsquo;t have magical\nwagons to fly over the siege lines and deliver trade into her city. No matter\nhow good a ruler is, these things are just not possible. Rebuilding an economy\nafter ending slavery is extremely difficult and takes a long time, and GRRM\nwrote a very realistic story with Daenerys. You can&rsquo;t expect everything to be\nperfect after only a few months of Daenerys ruling. But her efforts here show\nthat she\u2019s a good and responsible ruler, and did everything she could to\nrebuild Meeren\u2019s economy.</p><ul><li><b>The war against Yunkai and the question of peace and war</b><br/></li></ul><p>When\nDany conquers Meereen, she has seen the destruction that the war caused. Her\npeople are starving, and she has learned that she won\u2019t make things right just\nby freeing slaves and moving on from place to place. To make matters worse, she\nhas to deal with the terrorist organization The Sons of the Harpy, that are\nkilling freedmen, and even started killing her own soldiers. So it\u2019s no\nsurprise that with all of the slaughter and bloodshed, she wants peace more\nthan anything.</p><p>So\nDany starts making compromises with the slavers. These compromises involve\ndifferent things: she needs to marry Hizdahr, a powerful men who comes from one\nof the Great Master\u2019s families; she has to give indemnity in gold and gemstones to the slavers of Yunkai, as a compensation for disrupting the slave trade;\nshe has to allow slavery to return outside Meereen; she has to reopen the\nfighting pits; and she has to allow slavers from outside to bring their slaves into Meereen.</p><p>Many people accuse Dany of being\nstupid and naive for believing in Hizdahr and the peace, and not seeing that\nHizdahr is probably allied with the Sons of the Harpy. But this criticism is\nunfounded, because Dany does see that he\u2019s probably one of them:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; Dany studied his eyes. <b>&ldquo;Why should the Sons of the Harpy lay\ndown their knives for you? Are you one of them?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Would you tell me if you\nwere?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>He laughed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; - Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany makes these compromises not\nbecause she\u2019s naive, but because at her core, she is someone who doesn\u2019t like\nwar and conflicts. But there\nare also practical reasons: after chaining her dragons, Dany doesn\u2019t have\nenough military power to defy the masters. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Dany just\nmeekly accepts anything. She insists on the freedom of the people in Meereen,\nshe insists in certain rules for the fighting pits (like not allowing children,\nslaves, and not allowing thieves and debtors to be forced to fight), she\ndemands that the guilds of Meereen allow freedmen, and she trains her own\nsoldier companies, because she wants to be prepared to defend her city:</p><blockquote><p><i>He\u00a0was\u00a0wrong\u00a0in\nthat, she hoped. The freedmen had been a rabble once, but <b>she had organized the men of fighting age into companies and commanded\nGrey Worm to make them into soldiers.</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso has Ser Barristan training some boys to be knights.</p><p>With\nthese actions, Dany achieves a shaky peace with Yunkai, and she gets the Sons\nof the Harpy to stop attacking. She prepares her city in the case of a war. She\nalso manages to make her conditions on who fights in the pits, and to make\nchanges in the laws of Meereen, like in the case of the guilds. I think it\u2019s\nimportant to acknowledge that Dany\u2019s course of action in Meereen was a sensible\none, and she did achieve some small victories.</p><p>But\nthis plot isn\u2019t just about seeing just how much Dany can accomplish as a ruler.\nIt\u2019s also meant for her to reflect and learn about what peace and war mean. She\nstarts the books as someone who was appalled by the costs of war, and tries\neverything she can to get peace. But as time goes, she realizes that her\nmerciful path has also caused problems. One example is when she reflects about\ncertain mistakes that she made, like leaving the slave masters in power:</p><blockquote><p><i>She had not forgotten\nthe slave children the\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters\u00a0had nailed up along the\nroad from\u00a0Yunkai. They had numbered one hundred sixty-three, a child every\nmile, nailed to mileposts with one arm outstretched to point her way. After\nMeereen had fallen, Dany had nailed up a like number\nof\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters. Swarms of flies had attended their slow dying, and\nthe stench had lingered long in the plaza. <b>Yet\nsome days she feared that she had not gone far enough. These Meereenese were a\nsly and stubborn people who resisted her at every turn. They had freed their\nslaves, yes \u2026 only to hire them back as servants at wages so meagre that most\ncould scarce afford to eat.</b> Those too old or young to be of use had been\ncast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled. And still\nthe\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters\u00a0gathered atop their lofty pyramids to complain\nof how the dragon queen had filled their noble city with hordes of unwashed\nbeggars, thieves, and whores. \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nstarts to question the costs of peace as well:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;There may be another choice. <b>The Yunkai'i can be persuaded to allow all your freedmen to remain\nfree, I believe, if Your Worship will agree that the Yellow City may trade and\ntrain slaves unmolested from this day forth. No more blood need flow.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Save\u00a0for the blood of\nthose slaves that the Yunkai'i will trade and train,&rdquo;</i></b><i> Dany said, but she recognized the truth in his words even\nso. It may be that is the best end we can hope for. \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;His Grace is\ndreaming, but <b>I cannot sleep.

A Brazen Beast in a boar mask had offered the\nlitter bearer a skin of water. <b>&ldquo;I\nsuppose I must be thankful for small victories,&rdquo;</b> the queen said. \u2013\nDaenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>They\nstamped their feet and slapped their bellies and shouted, &ldquo;Mhysa, Mhysa,\nMhysa,&rdquo; </i></b><i>until\nthe whole pit seemed to tremble.

This is what I wanted, what I worked\nfor, this is why I married Hizdahr. So why does it taste so much like defeat?</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It is only for a little while more, my love,&rdquo;\nHizdahr had assured her. &ldquo;The Yunkai'i will soon be gone, and their allies\nand hirelings with them.

I will never trust them.&rdquo; If truth be\ntold, Dany was forgetting how to trust. &ldquo;We can still use them. One was a\nwoman. Meris. Send her back, as a \u2026 a gesture of my regard. If their captain is\na clever man, he will understand.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;The woman is the\nworst of all.&rdquo;</i><i></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;All the better.&rdquo; Dany\nconsidered a moment. &ldquo;We should sound out the Long Lances too. And the\nCompany of the Cat.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Bloodbeard.&rdquo; Ser Barristan&rsquo;s frown deepened.\n&ldquo;If it please Your Grace, we want no part of him.

But do it soon.\nIf Hizdahr&rsquo;s peace should break, I want to be ready. I do not trust the\nslavers.&rdquo; I do not trust my husband. &ldquo;They will turn on us at the\nfirst sign of weakness.&rdquo;</b></i><b><i></i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Yunkai'i grow weaker as well.

Quaithe warned me of the\npale mare&rsquo;s coming. She told me of the Dornish prince as well, the sun&rsquo;s son.\nShe told me much and more, but all in riddles. <b>&ldquo;I cannot rely on plague to save me from my enemies. Set\nPretty\u00a0Meris\u00a0free. At once.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nstarts to see that peace is not ideal like she had thought. And she starts to\nreflect if this peace is really worth it, and comes to the conclusion that it\nisn\u2019t:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;One will die, or the other will,&rdquo; said Dany.\n&ldquo;And the one who lives will die some other day. <b>This was a\u00a0mistake.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Strong Belwas ate too many locusts.&rdquo; There was a\nqueasy look on Belwas&rsquo;s broad brown face. &ldquo;Strong Belwas needs milk.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Hizdahr ignored the\neunuch. &ldquo;Magnificence, the people of Meereen have come to celebrate our\nunion. You heard them cheering you. Do not cast away their love.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It\nwas my floppy ears they cheered, not me. Take me from this abbatoir,\nhusband.&rdquo;</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This\nis as much about Dany reclaiming her identity as it is about her changing her\npolitical views. A peace that means that she has to give indemnity to slavers,\nwatch people fight to death, and let slavery continue is no true peace, because\nthousands and thousands of people will continue suffering the violence of\nslavery. And Dany doesn\u2019t want to be the kind of ruler that stands by while\ninjustice happens. So by the end of ADWD, she finally accepts fire and blood,\nwhich is necessary if she wants to end slavery once and for all.</p><p>I\nthink these reflections are necessary for Dany\u2019s learning. She needs\nto know when compromises are worth or not. She needs to learn how to be more\ndecisive to achieve the goals she has of social change. She needs to learn when\nto seek peace, and when to use Fire and Blood.</p><ul><li><b>The question of taking the wealth of the slave masters</b><br/></li></ul><p>I\u2019ve\nseen many people in the fandom saying that Dany should have taken the wealth of\nthe slavers. I agree with that. If Dany had taken their wealth, they would no\nlonger be able to finance an opposition against her. She could redistribute\ntheir wealth to the former slaves, helping to minimize inequality, and she\ncould have used it to buy sellswords to fight for her. This way, she wouldn\u2019t\nhave to compromise as much as she did. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think this\nwould solve all of her problems. Because, as I said, the economy was mostly\nbased on slavery. It would still take time to rebuild the economy and base it\non something else. It would take time for Meereen to become agriculturally\nindependent and for Meereen to start producing new products for trade.</p><p>And\nit\u2019s understandable why Dany doesn\u2019t do this. First, because she has no\nexperience, and she needs to learn. It would make no sense to write a story\nabout Dany learning if she already knows everything she has to do from the\nstart. Also, because, as pointed out in the previous sections, Dany is trying\nto be moderate and conciliatory. And as someone who is highborn, Dany doesn\u2019t\nreally believe in the idea of depriving the nobility of what they possess, even\nif she\u2019s siding with the oppressed. Taking the nobility\u2019s wealth is something\nthat is very against everything Dany has been taught her entire life. So at the\nbeginning of the story, Dany doesn\u2019t want to be too radical. But that doesn\u2019t\nmean she\u2019s not smart and doesn\u2019t think about it. This is actually something\nthat Dany herself does, even though she doesn\u2019t do it enough:</p><blockquote><p><i>That brought a smile to the Shavepate&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It will\nbe done,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but Your Radiance should know that the Great\nMasters of Zhak and Merreq are making preparations to quit their pyramids and\nleave the city.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Daenerys was sick unto death of Zhak and Merreq; she was\nsick of all the Mereenese, great and small alike. <b>&ldquo;Let them go, but see that they take no more than the clothes upon\ntheir backs. Make certain that all their\u00a0gold\u00a0remains here with us.\nTheir stores of food as well.&rdquo; </b>\u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\nlater, Daario too suggests it to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;You are fighting shadows when you should be fighting\nthe men who cast them,&rdquo; Daario went on. <b>&ldquo;Kill them all and take their treasures, I say.</b> Whisper the\ncommand, and your Daario will make you a pile of their heads taller than\nthis\u00a0pyramid.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If I knew who they were\u2014&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Zhak and Pahl and\nMerreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He is as bold as he is\nbloody. &ldquo;We have no proof this is their work. Would you have me slaughter\nmy own subjects?&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis reluctant. She\u2019s smart enough to realize that she needs to take the wealth of the masters, but she\u2019s not\nwilling to go too far (and she\u2019s even less willing to accept Daario\u2019s violent idea). But if the ending of ADWD is any indication, Dany has changed her stance, and won\u2019t be indecisive anymore.</p><ul><li><b>Conflicting interests within the city</b><br/></li></ul><p>Even\nthough I think the compromises and the peace were a mistake, I think it\u2019s\npointless to look at what Dany should have done. We need to look at what she\ndecided to do. Dany decided to strive for peace, so I think that we should look\nat how she worked to achieve that.</p><p>At the start of Dany\u2019s reign, slaves\nand slavers want different things, and there are many problems that arose with\nthe sack: the slavers want punishment for the crimes during the sack, and the\nslaves want the masters punished for their past crimes against them. In face of\nthis, Dany chooses conciliation, pardoning the crimes during the sack and the\ncrimes the slavers committed before she took the city, not only out of\nclemency, but also out of pragmatism:</p><blockquote><p><i>A former slave came, to\naccuse a certain noble of the Zhak. The man had recently taken to wife a\nfreedwoman who had been the noble&rsquo;s bedwarmer before the\u00a0city\u00a0fell.\nThe noble had taken her maidenhood, used her for his pleasure, and gotten her with\nchild. Her new husband wanted the noble gelded for the crime of rape, and he\nwanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble&rsquo;s bastard as\nhis own. Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding. <b>&ldquo;When he lay with her, your wife was his property, to do with as\nhe would. By law, there was no rape.&rdquo; Her decision did not please him, she\ncould see, but if she gelded every man who ever forced a bedslave, she would\nsoon rule a\u00a0city\u00a0of\u00a0eunuchs.</b></i><b><i></i></b></p><p><i>A boy came, younger than Dany, slight and scarred, dressed\nup in a frayed grey tokar trailing silver fringe. His voice broke when he told\nof how two of his father&rsquo;s household slaves had risen up the night the gate\nbroke. One had slain his father, the other his elder brother. Both had raped\nhis mother before killing her as well. The boy had escaped with no more than\nthe scar upon his face, but one of the murderers was still living in his\nfather&rsquo;s house, and the other had joined the queen&rsquo;s soldiers as one of the\nMother&rsquo;s Men. He wanted them both hanged.</i></p><p><b><i>I am queen over a city built on dust\nand death.</i></b><i> <b>Dany had no choice but to deny him. She had declared\na\u00a0blanket\u00a0pardon\u00a0for all crimes committed during the sack. Nor\nwould she punish slaves for rising up against their masters.</b> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>After the sack of Meereen, Dany had\npunished rapists and murderers amongst her own soldiers:</p><blockquote><p><b>She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists their manhood. </b>Eight killers swung from the walls, and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms, but Meereen was calm again. - Daenerys VI ASOS<br/></p></blockquote><p>But in Meereen, she\ncan\u2019t control what the slaves do while rising against their masters, and\npunishing crimes committed during the sack would be impractical and give rise\nto lots of conflicts and anger from the former slaves against her. Similarly,\npunishing the former masters would be impractical as well. This decision shows\nDany\u2019s pragmatism, and it was important for keeping some semblance of peace in\nMeereen.</p><p>She also rules that a rich woman\nthat lost her house cannot have it back, but that she can have back her jewels\nand clothes. I\u2019ve seen many people criticize Dany for it, but the intention was\nclear and consistent with Dany\u2019s intentions in Meereen. Dany tries to be conciliatory,\ngranting the woman her clothes and jewels, but denying her the house, because\nthe alternative would mean that the former slaves occupying the house would be\nhomeless.</p><p>Another instance in which we can see\nDany being conciliatory is how she treats the problem of the guilds of artisans\nin Meereen:</p><blockquote><p><i>Her sleepless night soon made itself felt. Before long she\nwas fighting off a yawn as Reznak prattled about the craftsmen's\u00a0guilds.\nThe stonemasons were wroth with her, it seemed. The bricklayers as well. Certain\nformer slaves were carving stone and laying bricks, stealing work\nfrom\u00a0guild\u00a0journeymen and masters alike. &ldquo;The freedmen work too\ncheaply, Magnificence,&rdquo; Reznak said. &ldquo;Some call themselves\njourneymen, or even masters, titles that belong by rights only to the craftsmen\nof the\u00a0guilds. The masons and the bricklayers do respectfully petition\nYour Worship to uphold their ancient rights and customs.&rdquo;<b></b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;The freedmen work cheaply\nbecause they are hungry,&rdquo; Dany pointed out. &ldquo;If I forbid them to\ncarve stone or lay bricks, the chandlers, the weavers, and the goldsmiths will\nsoon be at my gates asking that they be excluded from those trades as\nwell.&rdquo; She considered a moment. &ldquo;Let it be written that henceforth\nonly guild members shall be permitted to name themselves journeymen or masters\n\u2026 provided the guilds open their rolls to any freedman who can demonstrate the\nrequisite skills.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany manages to partially pacify the\nguild members, saying that only them could name themselves journeymen or masters, while also keeping the freedmen in their trades and demanding\nthat they have a place in the guilds.</p><p>To keep the peace, Dany also adapts\nto Meereenese culture and traditions. She speaks their language:</p><blockquote><p><i>A small, damp man, he smelled as if he had bathed in perfume\nand <b>spoke a bastard form of High\nValyrian, much corrupted and flavored with a thick Ghiscari growl.</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You are kind to say so,&rdquo;\nDany answered, in the same\u00a0tongue.</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys\nI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She wears the tokar, even though she\nunderstands what the garment symbolizes:</p><blockquote><p><i>Even wound properly, the\u00a0tokar required its wearer to\nhold it in place with the left hand. Walking in a\u00a0tokar\u00a0demanded\nsmall, mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy\ntrailing fringes. <b>It was not a garment\nmeant for any man who had to work. The\u00a0tokar\u00a0was a master&rsquo;s garment,\na sign of wealth and power.</b></i></p><p><b><i>Dany had wanted to ban the tokar\nwhen she took Meereen, but her advisors had convinced her otherwise. </i></b><i>&ldquo;The Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever\nhated,&rdquo; warned the Green Grace, Galazza Galare. &ldquo;In the wools of\nWesteros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall forever remain a\nstranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conqueror. Meereen&rsquo;s\nqueen must be a lady of Old Ghis.&rdquo; Brown Ben Plumm, the captain of the\nSecond Sons, had put it more succinctly. <b>&ldquo;Man\nwants to be the king o&rsquo; the rabbits, he best wear a pair o&rsquo; floppy ears.&rdquo; </b>\u2013\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This shows that Dany understands\nboth pros and cons of wearing the tokar. She understands that the garment is a\nsymbol of power. But as someone who\u2019s seeking peace, Dany chooses to wear it to\nbe conciliatory.</p><p>Another thing that she does is\nfollow the Meereenese marriage rites and religion, but with one exception:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Magnificence, you\ndo not understand,&rdquo; protested Reznak. <b>&ldquo;The\u00a0washing\u00a0of\nthe\u00a0feet\u00a0is hallowed by tradition. It signifies that you shall be\nyour husband&rsquo;s handmaid.</b> The wedding garb is fraught with meaning too. The\nbride is dressed in dark red veils above a tokar of white silk, fringed with\nbaby pearls.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>A bride price paid in\nblood. Daenerys was weary of fighting this battle. Even Ser Barristan did not\nthink she could win. &ldquo;No ruler can make a people good,&rdquo; Selmy had\ntold her. &ldquo;Baelor the Blessed prayed and fasted and built the Seven as\nsplendid a temple as any gods could wish for, yet he could not put an end to\nwar and want.&rdquo; A queen must listen to her people, Dany reminded herself.\n&ldquo;After the wedding Hizdahr will be king. Let him reopen the fighting pits\nif he wishes. I want no part of it.&rdquo; Let the blood be on his hands, not\nmine. She rose. &ldquo;<b>If my husband\nwishes me to\u00a0wash\u00a0his\u00a0feet, he must first\u00a0wash\u00a0mine.</b>\nI will tell him so this evening.&rdquo; She wondered how her betrothed would\ntake that. \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany understands that for the peace,\nshe must follow Meereenese traditions. But she also understands that as a woman\nin power, she can\u2019t afford to be seen as weak, so she can\u2019t be seen as \u201cher\nhusband\u2019s handmaid\u201d. Once again, Dany tries a conciliatory solution.</p><p>Courtesy is also important in\nkeeping the peace, and Dany does her best to be courteous even when she doesn\u2019t\nlike something:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the afternoon a\nsculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the\nPlaza of Purification with one cast in Dany&rsquo;s image. <b>She denied him with as much courtesy as she could muster.</b> A pike of\nunprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished\nto give it to the queen. <b>She admired the\nfish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, and sent the\npike to her kitchens.</b> A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished\nrings to wear to war. <b>She accepted it\nwith fulsome\u00a0thanks;</b> it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished\ncopper would flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she\nwould sooner be clad in steel. Even a young girl who knew nothing of the ways\nof war knew that. \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your Grace need only ask him. The noble Hizdahr awaits below. Send down to him if that is your pleasure.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>You presume too much, priestess, the queen thought, but she swallowed her anger and made herself smile.</i></b><i> &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; She sent for Ser Barristan and told the old knight to bring Hizdahr to her. <b>&ldquo;It is a long climb. Have the Unsullied help him up.&rdquo; </b>\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>He will be safer as a\nhostage. <b>My captain was not made\nfor\u00a0peace. Dany could not risk his cutting down Brown Ben Plumm, making\nmock of Hizdahr before the court, provoking the Yunkai'i, or otherwise\nupsetting the agreement that she had given up so much to win.</b> Daario was\nwar and woe. Henceforth, she must keep him out of her bed, out of her heart,\nand out of her. If he did not betray her, he would master her. She did not know\nwhich of those she feared the most. \u2013 VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nisn\u2019t always perfect. When dealing with Quentyn, she laughs at his story but\nforgets to explain the reason for her laugh in his language. But even though\nshe slips, Dany still makes an effort to be courteous with him:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo;\nDaenerys said. &ldquo;Prince Quentyn has crossed half the world to offer me his\ngift, I will not have him treated with discourtesy.&rdquo;</i></b><i> She turned to the Dornishmen.\n&ldquo;Would that you had come a year ago. I am pledged to wed the noble Hizdahr\nzo Loraq.&rdquo; - Daenerys VII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\nlater, because of Dany\u2019s courtesy and kindness, he comes to like her and\nrespect her:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Daenerys\u00a0never\u00a0laughed.\nThe rest of Meereen might see him as an amusing curiosity,</i></b><i> like the exiled Summer Islander King\nRobert used to keep at King&rsquo;s Landing, <b>but\nthe queen had always spoken to him gently.</b> \u2013 The Spurned Suitor ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>All\nof this shows that Dany is good enough at her courtesies, even if she sometimes\nslips.</p><p>Finally,\nDany is not petty and does not treat people with brutality, even when they\noffend her, and that\u2019s very important, because she needs to avoid being hated\n(some people will hate her regardless of what she does, because she goes\nagainst their interests, but it\u2019s important that Dany shows herself to be a\nmerciful queen):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>When\nshe told him, the boy rushed at her,</i></b><i> but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went\nsprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The\nhuge brown eunuch yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a\nrat. <b>&ldquo;Enough, Belwas,&rdquo; Dany called.\n&ldquo;Release him.&rdquo; To the boy she said, &ldquo;Treasure that tokar, for it\nsaved your life. You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here. You\nshould do the same.&rdquo;</b> But as he left the boy looked back over his\nshoulder, and when she saw his eyes Dany thought, The Harpy has another Son. -\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;We are all dead,\nthen. You gave us death, not freedom.&rdquo; <b>Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face.</b></i></p><p><i>Strong Belwas seized\nhim by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard\nGhael&rsquo;s teeth crack. The Shavepate would have done worse, but she stopped him.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo;\nshe said, dabbing at her cheek with the end of her tokar. &ldquo;No one has ever\ndied from spittle. Take him away.&rdquo; </i></b><i>- Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>With all of that, I think Dany actually\ndid a very good job to keep the peace. She is conciliatory, courteous, seeks\npeaceful solutions, while also trying to gain small victories for the freedmen.\nShe usually tries to find a middle ground. While I do think the peace was a\nmistake, I think this period in Dany\u2019s story was important for her to learn.</p><ul><li><b>Morality</b><br/></li></ul><p>Dany\nis a very kind person who strives to do good, but there are also moments in\nwhich she gets angered over the injustice that she witnesses. Dany didn\u2019t grow\nup with anyone to teach her about honor and justice, only Viserys. So this\nmeans that she sometimes makes mistakes and takes cruel actions.</p><p>The\nfirst we see is, of course, the crucifixions of 163 slave masters in punishment\nfor crucifying children. I see many people say that Dany doesn\u2019t care about\njustice, and that this action proves it, because she supposedly crucified\npeople without caring about guilt and innocence. But I wouldn\u2019t say this is\nexactly true. First, because Dany does not crucify random people. She asks for\nthe leaders of Meereen (Meereen is ruled by a council of masters), the ones most likely to be responsible for the children\u2019s\ndeaths.</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI\nwant your\u00a0leaders,\u201d Dany told them. \u201cGive them up, and the rest of you\nshall be spared.\u201d</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s\ntrue that this is still an eye for an eye, and it\u2019s still a cruel punishment.\nBut Dany does start to feel bad for the action, even if she still believes it\nto be justice:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany remembered the horror she had felt when she had seen\nthe Plaza of Punishment in Astapor. <b>I\nmade a horror just as great, but surely they deserved it. Harsh justice is\nstill justice.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>But\nlater in the books, Dany shows herself to care about innocence and guilt:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;You are fighting shadows when you should be fighting\nthe men who cast them,&rdquo; Daario went on. &ldquo;Kill them all and take their\ntreasures, I say. Whisper the command, and your Daario will make you a pile of\ntheir heads taller than this\u00a0pyramid.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If I knew who they were\u2014&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Zhak and Pahl and\nMerreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>He\nis as bold as he is bloody. &ldquo;We have no proof this is their work. Would\nyou have me slaughter my own subjects?&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;This we have heard. And yet <b>Your Radiance has found the courage to answer butchery with mercy. You\nhave not harmed any of the noble children you hold as hostage.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;These\nmurders are not their doing,&rdquo; Dany told the Green Grace, feebly. &ldquo;I\nam no butcher queen.&rdquo;</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Another\ncontroversial action that Dany takes is the torture of the wineseller\ndaughters. This is obviously wrong, but I need to point out that torture is\nconsidered a valid method of interrogation in this world. The Night\u2019s Watch\ndoes it, Jon considers throwing Janos Slynt in an ice cell to force him to\ncomply and later puts Cregan Karstark in those cells, Jaehaerys tortures people\nto find out who murdered Rego Draz, the High Sparrow does it, the Arryns have a\ntorturer and the sky cells that serve as psychological torture\u2026 I could go on,\nbut I think I\u2019ve made my point. Dany is a product of her society, so she\u2019s not\nacting any differently from other rulers. There was circumstancial evidence\nagainst the wineseller and his daughters. But we can see that Dany does care\nabout innocence:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;It will be done, Your Worship. Would you have me\nquestion them sweetly, or sharply?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Sweetly, to begin. Hear what\ntales they tell and what names they give you. It may be they had no part in\nthis.&rdquo;</i></b><i> She hesitated. &ldquo;Nine, the\nnoble Reznak said. Who else?&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nchanges her stance when she gets angered about the cruel death of Rylonna Rhee,\nand orders them to be questioned sharply. But later, Dany does learn from her\nmistakes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIf there is a Harpy.\u201d Skahaz was convinced that somewhere\nin Meereen the Sons of the Harpy had a highborn overlord, a secret general\ncommanding an army of shadows. Dany did not share his belief.\u00a0<b>The Brazen Beasts had taken dozens of the\nHarpy\u2019s Sons, and those who had survived their capture had yielded names when\nquestioned sharply \u2026 too many names, it seemed to her.</b>\u00a0It would have\nbeen pleasant to think that all the deaths were the work of a single enemy who\nmight be caught and killed, but Dany suspected that the truth was otherwise. My\nenemies are legion. \u201cHizdahr zo Loraq is a persuasive man with many friends.\nAnd he is wealthy. Perhaps he has bought this peace for us with gold, or\nconvinced the other highborn that our marriage is in their best interests.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf he is not the Harpy, he knows him. I can find the truth\nof that easy enough.\u00a0<b>Give me your\nleave to put Hizdahr to the question, and I will bring you a confession.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not trust\nthese confessions. You\u2019ve brought me too many of them, all of them worthless.\u201d</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>\u201cYour Radiance\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo, I said.\u201d</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nrealizes that torture is ineffective, and forbids it. Dany is the only ruler in\nthe books to explicitly forbid torture.</p><p>I\nthink what all of this shows is that Dany is trying very hard to be just. She\ndidn\u2019t grow up with a good moral example, but she strives to be better, while\nalso trying to rule. And she is willing to change her ways and learn from her\nmistakes.</p><ul><li><b>Practical aspects of ruling</b><br/></li></ul><p>Aside\nfrom trying to keep peace and bring justice, Dany also has to deal with the\ntedious aspects of ruling in Meereen. Dany is a very hands on ruler, and she\ndoesn\u2019t like to delegate too much:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Your Grace takes too much on\nherself. You should allow your\u00a0councillors\u00a0to shoulder more of your\nburdens.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I have too many councillors\nand too few cushions.&rdquo;</i></b><i> Dany turned to Reznak. &ldquo;How\nmany more?&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>While\nmaybe Dany does take too much on herself, this also means that she gets\npractice in the several aspects of the administration of a city. One of them is\nhow to get the money that she needs:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany was shocked.\u00a0<b>\u201cThey want to be slaves?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThe ones who come are\nwell spoken and gently born, sweet queen. Such slaves are prized. In the Free\nCities they will be tutors, scribes, bed slaves, even healers and priests. They\nwill sleep in soft beds, eat rich foods, and dwell in manses.\u00a0Here they\nhave lost all, and live in fear and squalor.\u201d</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;\nPerhaps it was not so shocking, if these tales of Astapor were true. Dany\nthought a moment. &ldquo;Any man who wishes to sell himself into slavery may do\nso. Or woman.&rdquo; She raised a hand. &ldquo;But they may not sell their\nchildren, nor a man his wife.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;In\nAstapor the city took a tenth part of the price, each time a slave changed\nhands,&rdquo;</i></b><i>\nMissandei told her.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the same,&rdquo; Dany\ndecided. Wars were won with gold as much as swords.\n&ldquo;A\u00a0tenth\u00a0part. In gold or silver coin, or ivory. Meereen has no\nneed of saffron, cloves, or zorse hides.&rdquo; </i></b><i>\u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>While Dany doesn\u2019t like the idea of\npeople selling themselves back into slavery, she thinks she must respect their\nchoices (without allowing them to sell other people unwillingly). But,\nfollowing Missandei\u2019s suggestion, she takes a part of the money of those\ntransactions. She turns something that she doesn\u2019t like to do (allowing people\nto sell themselves), and tries to make use of it, and she knows that \u201cwars are\nwon with gold as much as swords\u201d, meaning that Dany is not stupid and knows\nthat armies are not the only source of power. (NOTE: I don\u2019t think Dany should\nhave allowed people to sell themselves back into slavery, because this means\nthat she\u2019s allowing part of the slave trade to continue, allowing that some\npeople have the right to own others like objects. But Dany decided to take a\nmoderate approach, and what I\u2019m analysing in this section isn\u2019t what she should\nhave done overall, but how she dealt with the practical aspects of the\nadministration of her city. As an administrative measure, I think that if Dany\nwas going to let people sell themselves back into slavery, then she made a\nsmart decision by taking a part of the money). Later, we see that Dany continues\nwith this. As I already mentioned, she takes the wealth of the noble families\nthat choose to leave Meereen. She also imposes a blood tax to pay the wages of\nthe Brazen Beasts:</p><blockquote><p><i>Reznak mo Reznak gasped. <b>&ldquo;Magnificence, where is the coin to come from to pay wages for so\nmany men?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;From the pyramids. Call it a\nblood\u00a0tax. I will have a hundred pieces of gold from every pyramid for\neach freedman that the Harpy&rsquo;s Sons have slain.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>With this tax, Dany is trying to do\ntwo things at once: to get the money to pay for the soldiers that she needs,\nand to weaken the Meereenese noble families that conspire against her. It\ndoesn\u2019t work, because Dany is too mild with the slavers, and takes too little\nmoney from them. But this moment shows that Dany realizes that she can use\ntaxes not only to fill the city\u2019s coffers, but also to have political gains,\nlike weakening her enemies. We also see other moments in which Dany uses taxes\nto get some benefit out of a situation that she doesn\u2019t like:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your Magnificence,&rdquo; whispered Reznak mo Reznak in\nher ear, <b>&ldquo;it is customary for the\ncity to claim one-tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after\nexpenses, as a\u00a0tax. That coin might be put to many noble uses.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It might \u2026 though if we were\nto reopen the pits, we should take our tenth before expenses. I am only a young\ngirl and know little of such matters, but I dwelt with Xaro Xhoan Daxos long\nenough to learn that much.</i></b><i> Hizdahr, if you could marshal armies\nas you marshal arguments, you could conquer the world \u2026 but my answer is still\nno. For the sixth time.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis also smart enough to know that corruption might be a problem, and she takes\nmeasures to prevent it:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;It shall be done as you command, glorious queen,&rdquo;\nsaid Daario. &ldquo;My Stormcrows will collect your tenth.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>If\nthe Stormcrows saw to the collections at least half the gold would somehow go\nastray, Dany knew.</i></b><i>\nBut the Second Sons were just as bad, and the Unsullied were as unlettered as\nthey were incorruptible. <b>&ldquo;Records\nmust be kept,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Seek among the freedmen for men who can\nread, write, and do sums.&rdquo;</b></i><i> - Daenerys\nVI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s also another interesting\nmoment in which Dany has to deal with the possibility that people will try to\ntake advantage of her decrees:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Three-and-twenty.&rdquo; Dany sighed. <b>&ldquo;My dragons have developed a\nprodigious taste for mutton since we began to pay the shepherds for their\nkills. Have these claims been proven?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Some men have brought\u00a0burnt\u00a0bones.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Men\nmake fires. Men cook mutton. Burnt bones prove nothing.</i></b><i> Brown Ben says there\nare red wolves in the hills outside the city, and jackals and wild dogs. Must\nwe pay good silver for every lamb that goes astray between Yunkai and the\nSkahazadhan?&rdquo;</i><i></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, Magnificence.&rdquo; Reznak bowed. <b>&ldquo;Shall I send these rascals away, or\nwill you want them scourged?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Daenerys shifted on the bench. <b>&ldquo;No man should ever fear to come to me.&rdquo; Some claims\nwere\u00a0false, she did not doubt, but more were genuine.</b> Her dragons had\ngrown too large to be content with rats and cats and dogs. The more they eat,\nthe larger they will grow, Ser Barristan had warned her, and the larger they\ngrow, the more they&rsquo;ll eat. Drogon especially ranged far afield and could\neasily devour a sheep a day. <b>&ldquo;Pay\nthem for the value of their animals,&rdquo; she told Reznak, &ldquo;but\nhenceforth claimants must present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and\nswear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany is smart enough to see that some people\nare deceiving her, but instead of doing what Reznak suggests, Dany knows that\nif she deals with people with brutality, they will fear ever coming to her\nagain. Instead, she uses Meereen\u2019s religious beliefs to dissuade people from\nmaking false claims. There are also several moments in which Dany states that\nshe wants people to come to her with their problems, and that she doesn\u2019t want\nthem to be afraid to speak their minds or to criticize her:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; said Whitebeard, &ldquo;the Prince of\nDragonstone was a most puissant warrior, but &hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo;</i></b><i> she urged. <b>&ldquo;You\nmay\u00a0speak\u00a0freely\u00a0to me.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I say no, Your Grace,&rdquo; the old man answered at\nonce.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;<b>Speak</b>\u00a0<b>freely</b>.&rdquo;\n\u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Whitebeard bowed his head. &ldquo;Your Grace, I did not mean\nto give offense.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Only\u00a0lies\u00a0offend\u00a0me,\nnever honest counsel.&rdquo; Dany patted Arstan&rsquo;s spotted hand to reassure him.\n&ldquo;I have a dragon&rsquo;s temper, that&rsquo;s all. You must not let it frighten\nyou.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Whitebeard,&rdquo;\nshe said, <b>&ldquo;I want your\u00a0counsel,\nand you should never fear to speak your mind with me &hellip; when we are alone.</b>\nBut never question me in front of strangers. Is that understood?&rdquo; \u2013\nDaenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>&ldquo;Then what do you\u00a0advise, Ser Jorah?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;You will not like it.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I\nwould hear it all the same.&rdquo;</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys V ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany also has to run investigations\nto find out who the Sons of the Harpy are, and has to find ways to protect her\npeople and her soldiers from them. In the end, she doesn\u2019t succeed (she only succeeds after she makes the peace deals), but Dany\ndoes take some important measures. She tries what she can to ensure the safety\nof her soldiers:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;\u2026 drawn in blood.&rdquo;\nDaenerys knew the way of it by now. The Sons of the Harpy did their butchery by\nnight, and over each kill they left their mark. <b>&ldquo;Grey Worm, why was this man alone? Had he no partner?&rdquo; By\nher command, when the Unsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they\nalways walked in pairs. </b>- Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>She also does what she can to\nconduct investigations:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Send men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any\nman has come to the Blue Graces with a sword wound. And spread the word that we\nwill pay good gold for the short sword of Stalwart Shield. Inquire of the\nbutchers and the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of late.&rdquo;\nPerhaps some goatherd would confess. &ldquo;Henceforth, no man of mine walks\nalone after dark.&rdquo;</b> - Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Dany has to deal with a\nplague. And for her, it\u2019s a lot of trial and error to try to find a solution to\nthe pale mare situation:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Daenerys\ndare not open her gates to let them in.</i></b><i> She had tried to do what she could for them. <b>She had sent them healers</b>, Blue Graces\nand spell-singers and barber-surgeons, <b>but\nsome of those had sickened as well, and none of their arts had slowed the\ngalloping progression of the flux that had come on the pale mare. Separating\nthe healthy from the\u00a0sick\u00a0had proved impractical as well.</b> Her\nStalwart Shields had tried, pulling husbands away from wives and children from\ntheir mothers, even as the Astapori wept and kicked and pelted them with\nstones.<b> A few days later,\nthe\u00a0sick\u00a0were dead and the healthy ones were\u00a0sick. Dividing the\none from the other had accomplished nothing.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Many shat where they slept now, too\nfeeble to crawl to the ditches she&rsquo;d commanded them to dig.</i></b><i> Two women fought over a charred bone. Nearby a boy of ten\nstood eating a rat. He ate one-handed, the other clutching a sharpened stick\nlest anyone try to wrest away his prize. Unburied dead lay everywhere. Dany saw\none man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak, but as she rode past his\ncloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women sat upon the ground\nclutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. Those who had the strength\ncalled out. &ldquo;Mother \u2026 please, Mother \u2026 bless you, Mother \u2026&rdquo;</i><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;They are too feeble,&rdquo; said Symon Stripeback.</i></p><p><b><i>Dany said, &ldquo;More food might\nmake them\u00a0stronger.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>Symon shook his head. &ldquo;Food should not be wasted on the\ndying, Your Worship. We do not have enough to feed the living.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>He was not wrong, she\nknew, but that did not make the words any easier to hear.</b> &ldquo;This is far\nenough,&rdquo; the queen decided. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll feed them here.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys\nVI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Dany gazed across the\ncamp, to the many-colored brick walls of Meereen. The air was thick with flies\nand cries. &ldquo;The gods have sent this pestilence to humble me. <b>So many dead \u2026 I will not have them\neating\u00a0corpses.&rdquo;</b> She beckoned Aggo closer. &ldquo;Ride to the\ngates and bring me Grey Worm and fifty of his Unsullied.&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys VI\nADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>By the time Aggo returned with Grey Worm and fifty of the\nUnsullied loping behind his horse, Dany had shamed all of them into helping\nher. <b>Symon Stripeback and his men were\npulling the living from the dead and stacking up the corpses, while Jhogo and\nRakharo and their Dothraki helped those who could still walk toward the shore\nto\u00a0bathe\u00a0and wash their clothes.</b> Aggo stared at them as if they\nhad all gone mad, but Grey Worm knelt beside the queen and said, &ldquo;This one\nwould be of help.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Before midday a dozen fires were\nburning. </i></b><i>Columns of greasy black smoke rose\nup to stain a merciless blue sky. Dany&rsquo;s riding clothes were stained and sooty\nas she stepped back from the pyres. <b>&ldquo;Worship,&rdquo;\nGrey Worm said, &ldquo;this one and his brothers beg your leave to bathe in the\nsalt sea when our work here is done, that we might be purified according to the\nlaws of our great goddess.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Though\nthe queen had let the Astapori starve outside her walls to keep the\nbloody\u00a0flux\u00a0from spreading, it was spreading nonetheless.</i></b><i> Many had been\nstricken: freedmen, sellswords, Brazen Beasts, even Dothraki, <b>though as yet none of\nthe\u00a0Unsullied\u00a0had been touched.</b> She prayed the worst was past. \u2013\nDaenerys VII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the quotes above are very\ninteresting because we can see Dany gaining experience as she tries to control\nthe situation. She tries sending healers, but they get sick. She tries\nseparating sick and healthy, but soon sees that people don\u2019t want to be separated\nfrom their loved ones. She tries giving them more food. She digs ditches, burn\ncorpses and helps to clean people. Those things show that Dany has some idea\nthat she needs to be careful to not spread the disease (she closes the gates),\nand at the same time, she also understands that hygiene is important. I think\nthat the observation about how the Unsullied were not touched by the plague is\nsomething that, in the future, will be useful for Dany, something that she will\nremember. In conclusion, I think these moments show just how much Dany is\ntrying to learn from the situation, how she seems to be taking note of what\nworks and what doesn\u2019t. I think Dany will come out of this much more prepared\nto deal with similar situations when necessary, and I think this is important\nto her growth as a ruler as well.</p><p>In my opinion, Dany has shown\nherself to be very smart and capable of dealing with the practical aspects of\nthe administration of a city.</p><ul><li><b>Dany\u2019s equalitarian practices</b><br/></li></ul><p>One thing that distinguishes Dany as\na ruler is how she gives power and voice to the smallfolk. She listens to them at court and\ncouncil, and gives them the same respect:</p><blockquote><p><i>Reznak would have summoned another tokar next, but\nDany insisted that he call upon a freedman. <b>Thereafter she\u00a0alternated\u00a0between the former masters and the\nformer slaves.</b></i> \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Rylona Rhee had played the harp as sweetly as the\nMaiden<b>. When she had been a slave in\nYunkai, she had played for every highborn family in the city. In Meereen she\nhad become a leader amongst the Yunkish freedmen, their voice in\nDany's\u00a0councils.</b></i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Late that afternoon Admiral Groleo and Ser Barristan\nreturned from their inspection of the galleys. Dany assembled\nher\u00a0council\u00a0to hear them. <b>Grey\nWorm was there for the Unsullied</b>, Skahaz mo Kandaq for the Brazen Beasts.\nIn the absence of her bloodriders, a wizened jaqqa rhan called Rommo,\nsquint-eyed and bowlegged, came to speak for her Dothraki. <b>Her freedmen were represented by the captains of the three companies\nshe had formed\u2014Mollono Yos Dob of the Stalwart Shields, Symon Stripeback of the\nFree Brothers, Marselen of the Mother&rsquo;s Men</b>. Reznak mo Reznak hovered at\nthe queen&rsquo;s elbow, and Strong Belwas stood behind her with his huge arms\ncrossed.</i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><ul><li><b>Some mistakes worth addressing</b><br/></li></ul><p>One mistake that Dany makes is that\nshe takes hostages, but fails to kill them when the Sons of the Harpy attack.\nIf she wasn&rsquo;t going to kill her hostages, she shouldn&rsquo;t have taken hostages in\nthe first place. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that Dany understands her\nfailure in this situation:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany pushed her food\nabout her plate. She dare not glance over to where Grazhar and Qezza stood, for\nfear that she might cry. The Shavepate has a harder heart than mine. They had\nfought about the hostages half a dozen times. &ldquo;The Sons of the Harpy are\nlaughing in their pyramids,&rdquo; Skahaz said, just this morning. &ldquo;What\ngood are hostages if you will not take their heads?&rdquo; <b>In his eyes, she was only a weak woman.</b> Hazzea was enough. What\ngood is peace if it must be purchased with the blood of little children?\n&ldquo;These murders are not their doing,&rdquo; Dany told the Green Grace,\nfeebly. &ldquo;I am no butcher queen.&rdquo; - Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s\nnot like Dany doesn\u2019t know she made a mistake. She knows the Shavepate sees her\nas weak, and she knows her enemies must think this as well. So I believe that\nin the future, Dany won\u2019t take hostages unless she intends to kill them.</p><p>There\nare also moments in which Dany is too open:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;On what\nterms?&rdquo; Beware the perfumed seneschal, Quaithe had said. The masked woman\nhad foretold the coming of the pale mare, was she right about the noble Reznak\ntoo? &ldquo;I may be a young girl innocent of war, but I am not a lamb to walk\nbleating into the harpy&rsquo;s den. I still have my Unsullied. I have the Stormcrows\nand the Second Sons. I have three companies of freedmen.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Them, and\ndragons,&rdquo; said Brown Ben Plumm, with a grin.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;In\nthe pit, in chains,&rdquo; wailed Reznak mo Reznak.</i></b><i> &ldquo;What good are\ndragons that cannot be controlled? Even the Unsullied grow fearful when they\nmust open the doors to feed them.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What, o&rsquo; the\nqueen&rsquo;s little pets?&rdquo; Brown Ben&rsquo;s eyes crinkled in amusement. The grizzled\ncaptain of the Second Sons was a creature of the free companies, a mongrel with\nthe blood of a dozen different peoples flowing through his veins, but he had\nalways been fond of the dragons, and them of him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Pets?&rdquo;\nscreeched Reznak. &ldquo;Monsters, rather. Monsters that feed on children. We\ncannot\u2014&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo;\nsaid Daenerys. &ldquo;We will not speak of that.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>Reznak shrank away from\nher, flinching from the fury in her tone. &ldquo;Forgive me, Magnificence, I did\nnot \u2026&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>Dany sighed. <b>&ldquo;I am sorry, Ben. I dare not loose the\ndragons.&rdquo; She could see that was not the answer that he wanted.</b> -\nDaenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>In\nthis scene, we can see that Dany tries to control the information, and she\ntries to silence Reznak when he starts to speak too much. But in the end, she\nends up telling Ben that she will not use the dragons, which ends up leading to\nhim betraying her. But I think this can be seen as a slip, not a flaw in Dany\nas a ruler, because we see in several other moments that Dany is not a gullible\nperson. She distrusts Xaro and Pyat Pree in Qarth, and in Meereen, she refuses\nto tell Xaro her secrets:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Is that meant to\nfrighten me? I lived in fear for fourteen years, my lord. I woke afraid each\nmorning and went to sleep afraid each night \u2026 but my fears were burned away the\nday I came forth from the fire. Only one thing frightens me now.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;And\nwhat is it that you fear, sweet queen?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I\nam only a foolish young girl.&rdquo;</i></b><i> Dany rose on her toes and kissed his cheek. <b>&ldquo;But not so foolish as to tell you\nthat.</b> My men shall look at these ships. Then you shall have my\nanswer.&rdquo; - Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso tells Hazzea\u2019s father that he shouldn\u2019t tell anyone about what happened.\nEven in the scene in which she tells Ben that she can\u2019t use her dragons, she\ndoes try to be cautious about the information she discloses, and she can\nrecognize her mistake with Ben Brown Plumm:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Never that,&rdquo; said Brown Ben, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not all about the\ncoin, Your High-and-Mightiness. [&hellip;] Silver&rsquo;s sweet and gold&rsquo;s our mother, but\nonce you&rsquo;re dead they&rsquo;re worth less than that last shit you take as you lie\ndying. I told you once, there are old sellswords and there are bold sellswords,\nbut there are no old bold sellswords. My boys didn&rsquo;t care to die, that&rsquo;s all,\nand when I told them that you couldn&rsquo;t unleash them dragons against the\nYunkishmen, well \u2026&rdquo;</p><p><b>You saw me as defeated,\nDany thought, and who am I to say that you were wrong?</b> - Daenerys VIII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So\nI would say this was mostly a slip. Dany is not an stupid and naive person, and\nshe can see what her mistakes were.</p><p>Another\nthing that Dany fails to do is that, as Tyrion notes, is that she doesn\u2019t poison the\nwell outside Meereen, which would have helped her to defeat the siege of the\nYunkai\u2019i. We are never told the reasons for it in Dany\u2019s POV, but if I could\nguess, I imagine it\u2019s for the same reason that Dany has been so insistent on\npeace: she knows that if she poisons the wells, she would be condemning the\nAstapori refugees to death. We still don\u2019t know what Dany will do next in her\nstory, but I guess it\u2019s understandable why Dany doesn\u2019t do this, because she\u2019s\ntrying to do the right thing.</p><p>Finally,\nwe also have this moment, in which Dany and Barristan are talking about the\nBrazen Beasts:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;A mask can hide many things, Your Grace. Is the man\nbehind the owl mask the same owl who guarded you yesterday and the day before?\nHow can we know?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;How\nshould\u00a0Meereen\u00a0ever come to trust the Brazen Beasts if I do not?</i></b><i> There are good brave men beneath those masks. I put my life\ninto their hands.&rdquo; Dany smiled for him. &ldquo;You fret too much, ser. I\nwill have you beside me, what other protection do I need?&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys IX\nADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>There\nare pros and cons in each approach. The reason for the mask of the Brazen\nBeasts is for them to not be recognized, so they won\u2019t be targeted and attacked\nby the Sons of the Harpy. And from the perspective of someone that is seeking\npeace, Dany is right in saying that she can\u00b4t ask Meereen to trust the Brazen\nBeasts if she doesn\u00b4t.\nIt\u00b4s a question of appearances: she needs to show confidence if she wants her\npeople to feel safe and\ntrust the Brazen Beasts. On the other hand, Barristan is right in saying that\nmasks can make it easier for her enemies to hide (though Dany is not completely unprotected. She still keeps people she trusts by her side, like\nBarristan and Belwas, so it\u2019s not like Dany is neglectful of her own safety).\nBesides, Dany has let Hizdahr appoint a cousin to the command of the Brazen\nBeasts, which is bad for her, because this could make her lose control of one\nof her more important military forces. So there are good points to be made\nin favor of Dany\u2019s decisions here, but also good points against her decisions.</p><p>I\nthink these mistakes show that Dany isn\u2019t perfect, but in no way they mean that\nDany is a bad ruler. They mean that Dany is a human being, so sometimes she\nslips, while also trying to do what\u2019s right. And Dany does understand some of her\nmistakes. She\u2019s mindful of them, which is a positive thing.</p><p><b>IS DAENERYS A GOOD RULER? WHAT DID SHE LEARN?</b></p><p>Now\nlet\u2019s look at Dany\u2019s whole journey. In AGOT, Dany learns the importance of\nculture and traditions, she learns how to be strong and assertive, and with\nJorah Mormont, she asks for information about Westeros and the Dothraki that\nher brother never bothers to ask.</p><p>In\nACOK, Dany leads her people out of the Red Waste by giving an example of\nstrength, determination, care for her people, respect for their culture,\npragmatism and by making the sensible decision to send her bloodriders to find\na way out of the desert so they don\u2019t have to walk blindly through the desert.\nIn Qarth, she\u2019s suspicious and cautious but not paranoid, she escapes\ndeceptions and temptations, and finds a new resolve.</p><p>In\nASOS, Dany makes brilliant battle plans, but also big mistakes. But she learns\nfrom her mistakes: she understands her failure in leaving Astapor behind\nwithout an army to protect it, and she understands her failure in leaving the\nmasters of Yunkai in power.</p><p>In\nADWD, Dany does everything possible to rebuild the economy (she plants crops,\nnegotiates for trade, and make compromises to lift the siege against Meereen),\nand to keep the people of Meereen free. She deals well with taxes, and does\neverything she can to stop the plague. She trains new soldier companies to\nprotect her city, and later tries to make the sellswords change sides, because\nshe know that she must be prepared if the peace breaks. She makes compromises to\nbring peace, and acts accordingly to make the peace deals work. In my opinion,\nall of this shows that Dany was a very good ruler in Meereen. She took a very sensible\ncourse of action, probably the best she could have done in the circumstances,\nbecause she didn\u2019t have enough military power to defeat the slavers. Her\nwillingness to make compromises shows that she is the kind of ruler who seeks\npeaceful solutions. But in the end, Dany comes to reflect on the pros and cons\nof peace, and decides that the peace wasn\u2019t worth it, because it was an unjust\npeace. This is important because Dany needs to know when to look for peaceful\nsolutions, and when war is necessary. Dany will certainly come out of this as a\nmore decisive and mature ruler.</p><p>Besides,\nher actions as a queen that cares about her people are bearing fruits. Her\npeople still love her and support her even in the direst times:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany saw one man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak,\nbut as she rode past his cloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women\nsat upon the ground clutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. <b>Those who had the strength called out.\n&ldquo;Mother \u2026 please, Mother \u2026 bless you, Mother \u2026&quot;\u00a0</b></i><i>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Later, when Dany is gone from the\ncity, her people are still loyal to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>When His Grace had\ntried to put them under the command of a cousin, as he had the Brazen Beasts, <b>Grey Worm had informed the king that they\nwere free men who took commands only from their\u00a0mother.</b></i>\n\u2013 The Queensguard ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&quot;Is it true?&rdquo; a freedwoman shouted. <b>&ldquo;Is our\u00a0mother\u00a0dead?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; Reznak screeched. &ldquo;Queen\nDaenerys will return to Meereen in her own time in all her might and majesty.\nUntil such time, His Worship King Hizdahr shall\u2014&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;He\nis no king of mine,&rdquo; a freedman yelled.</i></b>\n\u2013 The Discarded Knight ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Their loyalty to Dany is what keeps\neveryone together:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>A\u00a0young\u00a0girl\u00a0she\nmight be, but Daenerys Targaryen was the only thing that held them all\ntogether.</i></b><i>\n\u2013 The Queen\u2019s Hand ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\npeople continue fighting for Dany. Barristan deposes Hizdahr for the suspicion\nthat he was the one that tried to poison her. When Yunkai attacks in the TWOW\nchapters that were released, the Mother\u2019s Men, Free Brothers, Stalwart Shields,\nthe pit fighters and the Brazen Beasts are all there willing to fight, even\nthough Yunkai has the numerical advantage. And it\u2019s not only loyalty for Dany,\nbut also the hope that she gave them, that they can fight for their own freedom.\nThe revolution that Dany started is not just in her hands anymore, it\u2019s being\ncarried by everyone else. That\u2019s her legacy. And it\u2019s a great thing that\nDaenerys was able to accomplish that.</p><p>Dany\nis politically savvy. She is observant, capable of adapting to other cultures\nand to different situations, speaks several languages, listens to her people\nregardless of birth or social status, cares for women, sees her position of\nqueen as a duty to her people, is self critical, conciliatory, merciful (even if she does get angry and make mistakes sometimes), courteous,\nunderstands the importance of keeping up appearances and manipulating people\u2019s\nperceptions of her and of the different situations, is pragmatic, knows how to\nassess the strength of each man under her command and use them accordingly,\nalways tries to learn more and seeks for information, listens to counsel, is\nnot gullible but is not paranoid either, respects people\u2019s humanity and tries\nto make social chances that benefit the oppressed. She is good at understanding\npeople&rsquo;s motivations (like Hizdahr&rsquo;s true intentions in reopening the fighting\npits), she understands supply and demand, understands symbols of power (like\nthe tokar), understands that she can&rsquo;t answer people with brutality or else her\npeople will be afraid to come to her, and understands that she needs to be seen\ncaring about her people. She\nhas gained experience in managing the economy, avoiding corruption, commanding armies, diplomacy and\ncompromises. And she has gained a more mature understanding of peace and war.</p><p><a></a>Dany still has things to learn, of\ncourse. She has now decided on a fire and blood path. I do believe this is\nnecessary to end slavery and that making peace with the slavers was the wrong\nchoice. But it\u2019s also very likely that Dany will make mistakes, and at some\npoints, she might go too far with fire and blood.\u00a0\n\nShe has an even bigger internal conflict coming her way in The Winds of Winter: how far is Dany willing to go? What kind of violence is justified?\n\n But this is important for\nDany to learn. She won\u2019t become the perfect ruler in a single day. And Dany has\nan even bigger responsibility, because she owns the only dragons in the entire\nworld, and has to learn how to wield a huge power responsibly.</p><p><a></a>But regardless of what happens in future books, I do think that, given all I discussed here, Dany is a great leader and a great ruler.</p>",

What did she learn?</b></p>[[MORE]]<p><b>DANY\u2019S CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION</b><br></p><p>Dany spent her childhood poor,\nhomeless, and had to go from place to place, never stopping for too long. She\ndidn\u2019t have money or stability to have a formal education: </p><blockquote><p><i><b>After Ser Willem had died</b>, the servants had stolen what\nlittle money they had left, and soon after <b>they had been put out of the big\nhouse.</b> Dany had cried when the\u00a0red\u00a0door\u00a0closed behind them\nforever.</i></p><p><i><b>They had wandered since then</b>, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr\nto Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, <b>never staying long in any one\nplace. </b>Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper\u2019s hired knives were close\nbehind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.</i></p><p><i><b>At first the magisters\nand archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to\ntheir homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to\nsit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner.</b> Years past\nthey had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin\nthey had gotten from Mother\u2019s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of\nPentos, they called her brother \u201cthe beggar king.\u201d Dany did not want\nto know what they called her. \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Dany\nlater confirms that she indeed never had any formal education:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cTell me of this other Daenerys. <b>I know less than I\nshould of the history of my father\u2019s kingdom. I never had\na\u00a0maester\u00a0growing up.</b>\u201d Only a brother. \u2013 </i>Daenerys VIII ADWD<i></i></p></blockquote><p>But we also have this quote:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cA queen must listen to all,\u201d [\u2026] <b>She had read that in a\u00a0book.</b> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I ASOS<i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany spent her childhood poor,\nhomeless, without receiving a formal education. Most of what Dany knows comes\nfrom Viserys, from her own experience, and from a few books she has read. Given\nthat Dany and Viserys were poor, I imagine that the only times that Dany\nhad access to books were when they were guests at some archon\u2019s or prince\u2019s\nhome, and this was only in the beginning, before the doors started closing on\nthem. I think this is the first thing we need to know if we want to understand Dany\u2019s mistakes and beliefs, and not crucify her for them. Daenerys is not\nsupposed to start the story as a great leader who makes no mistakes. Her story,\nfrom the very beginning, is all about learning.</p><p><b>DANY\u2019S INTELLIGENCE, WISDOM AND INTROSPECTIVENESS</b></p><p>Despite lacking education and\nexperience, Dany shows herself to be very intelligent and wise.</p><p>Dany is observant, always aware of\nher situation, surroundings and of the people around her:</p><blockquote><p><i>Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he\u2019d never had a friend he wouldn\u2019t cheerfully sell for the right price. <b>Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things</b>, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The cobbler thanked her for that, and the old brickmaker kissed her foot, </i><b><i>but the weaver looked at her with eyes as hard as slate. She knows I lie, the queen thought.</i> </b>- Daenerys V ADWD<br></p></blockquote><p>She is not\ngullible:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy does he give\nus so much?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat does he want from us?\u201d For nigh on\nhalf a year, they had lived in the magister\u2019s house, eating his food, pampered\nby his servants. <b>Dany was thirteen, old\nenough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the\nfree city of Pentos.</b>\u00a0\u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT<i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThey are your people, and they love you well,\u201d\nMagister Illyrio said amiably. \u201cIn holdfasts all across the realm, men\nlift secret toasts to your\u00a0health\u00a0while women sew dragon banners and\nhide them against the day of your return from across the water.\u201d He gave a\nmassive shrug. \u201cOr so my agents tell me.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Dany had no agents, no way of\nknowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she\nmistrusted Illyrio\u2019s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio.</i></b><i> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\ntook the warlock\u2019s words well salted</i></b><i>, but the magnificence of the great city was not to\nbe denied. \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI do not\nunderstand her.\u201d <b>Pyat and Xaro had\nshowered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons,\ndeclaring themselves her loyal servants in all things,</b> but from Quaithe she\nhad gotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never\nseen the woman\u2019s face. <b>Remember\u00a0Mirri\u00a0Maz\nDuur, she told herself. Remember treachery. She turned to her bloodriders.\n\u201cWe will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that no one enters\nthis wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that the dragons are always\nwell guarded.</b>\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Thirteen. To be sure.\nXaro was one of the Thirteen. No doubt he had convinced each of his fellow\nmembers to give up one ship. She knew the merchant prince too well to think\nthat he would sacrifice thirteen of his own ships. <b>\u201cI must consider this. May I inspect these ships?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYou\nhave grown suspicious, Daenerys.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>Always.\n\u201cI have grown wise, Xaro.\u201d </i></b>- Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>But at the same time, Dany is not\nparanoid, and she knows that she needs to take risks to get what she wants or\nneeds:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cIt\nseems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts\neveryone. Every man I take into my service is a\u00a0risk, I understand that,\nbut how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such\u00a0risks? Am I to conquer\nWesteros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?\u201d</i></b><i> </i>\u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI am glad you\ncame to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.\u201d <b>I will not trust you, but I need you. I\nneed your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.</b> </i>- Daenerys III\nADWD</p></blockquote><p>We\ncontinue to see this attitude in all of the books, with good, bad and uncertain\nresults: Dany trusts Barristan, which was a good thing. Despite being warned by\nQuaithe\u2019s prophecies and the prophecies of the House of the Undying, Dany is\nnot paranoid about them. She is aware of the danger from Reznak (who she thinks\nis the perfumed seneschal) and Quentyn (the Sun\u2019s son), the danger from\nsellswords and people in her court, but she tries to make use of everyone even\nthough she doesn\u2019t fully trust them, trying not to be gullible but without\nbeing paranoid.</p><p>Dany\nis very adaptable and respects different cultures, which enables her to survive\ndifferent situations, while her brother fails:</p><blockquote><p><i>Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse\nrearing beneath him as he reined up too hard. \u201cYou dare!\u201d he screamed\nat her. \u201cYou give commands to me? To me?\u201d He vaulted off the horse,\nstumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet.\nHe grabbed her, shook her. \u201cHave you forgotten who you are? Look at you.\nLook at you!\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Dany did not need to look. She was\nbarefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest\ngiven her as a bride gift. She looked as though she\u00a0belonged\u00a0here.\nViserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail.</i></b><i> \u2013 </i>Daenerys III AGOT<i></i></p></blockquote><p>She\u2019s\nalso very introspective, capable of reflecting on her experiences and mistakes,\nand always tries to learn and improve. One of the things she tries to improve\nis her magical knowledge:<i></i></p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI thank you, Mirri Maz\nDuur,\u201d she said, \u201cfor the lessons you have taught me.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cYou will not hear me\u00a0scream,\u201d Mirri\nresponded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI will,\u201d Dany said, \u201cbut it is not your\nscreams I want, only your life. <b>I\nremember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.</b>\u201d \u2013 </i>Daenerys X AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And when Dany\u2019s bloodriders and Ser\nJorah tell Dany to not enter the House of The Undying, Dany tells them that the\nreason she wants to go is to obtain more knowledge:</p><blockquote><p><i>Ser Jorah Mormont gave the merchant prince a sour look.\n\u201cYour Grace, remember\u00a0Mirri\u00a0Maz Duur.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI do,\u201d Dany said, suddenly decided. \u201c<b>I remember that she had knowledge.</b> And\nshe was only a maegi.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys IV ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She tries to improve her military\nknowledge:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany reined in her mare\nand looked across the fields, to where the Yunkish host lay athwart her path. <b>Whitebeard had been teaching her how best\nto\u00a0count the numbers of a foe. \u201cFive thousand,\u201d she said after a\nmoment.</b> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nloves books, and tries to learn from them:</p><blockquote><p><i>Ser Jorah Mormont\napologized for his gift. \u201cIt is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor\nexile could afford,\u201d he said as <b>he\nlaid a small stack of old\u00a0books\u00a0before her. </b>They were histories and\nsongs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue.<b> She thanked\nhim with all her heart. </b>\u2013 Daenerys II AGOT</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cA\u00a0queen\u00a0must\u00a0listen\u00a0to\u00a0all,\u201d[\u2026]\n<b>She had read that in a book.</b>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys I ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m\ncold,\u201d Dany lied. <b>\u201cBring me\nthe\u00a0book\u00a0I was reading last night.\u201d She wanted to lose herself\nin the words, in other times and other places. </b>The fat leather-bound volume\nwas full of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms. Children\u2019s stories, if\ntruth be told; too simple and fanciful to be true history. All the heroes were\ntall and handsome, and you could tell the traitors by their shifty eyes. Yet\nshe loved them all the same.

In Vaes Tolorro, her people don\u2019t want to enter the city out of\nfear, but Dany insists:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI\nfear no\u00a0ghosts. Dragons are more powerful than\u00a0ghosts.\u201d<b> And figs\nare more important.</b></i><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>We\ncan also see her pragmatism in relation to war and conquest:</p><blockquote><p><i>The thought of home disquieted her. If her sun-and-stars had\nlived, he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away\nher enemies, but his strength had left the world. Her bloodriders remained,\nsworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the ways of the\nhorselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, they did not\nrule them. <b>Dany had no wish to reduce\nKing\u2019s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts. She had supped\nenough on tears. I want to make my kingdom beautiful, to fill it with fat men\nand pretty maids and laughing children.

She very easily sees the political consequences of\nRobert\u2019s death (she doesn\u2019t have the full picture, but she very quickly\nunderstands the flaws in her reasoning when Jorah points it out):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cBefore,\nthe Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo's\u00a0khalasar, a hundred thousand made\nas one by his strength. Now they fly to pieces, even as\nthe\u00a0khalasar\u00a0did after my khal lay dead.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\ncan see Hizdahr\u2019s true intention behind the reopening of the fighting pits, and\nshe\u2019s capable of making an analysis of the political and economic situation\nshe\u2019s in:</p><blockquote><p><i>I need this man, Dany\nreminded herself. <b>Hizdahr was a wealthy\nmerchant with many friends in Meereen, and more across the seas.

She trusted Skahaz more than she trusted Hizdahr, but <b>the Shavepate would be a disaster as a king. He was too quick to anger, too slow to forgive. </b>- Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands that she needs to be seen caring for her people:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cGo if you wish,\nser. I will not detain you. I will not detain any of you.\u201d Dany vaulted\ndown from the horse. <b>\u201cI cannot heal\nthem, but I can show them that their Mother cares.\u201d</b> - Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>But even though she has to keep up\nappearances, she tries to be just:</p><blockquote><p><i>Her name had been\u00a0Hazzea. She was four years old.\nUnless her father lied. He might have lied. No one had seen the dragon but him.\nHis proof was burned bones, but burned bones proved nothing. He might have\nkilled the little girl himself, and burned her afterward. He would not have\nbeen the first father to dispose of an unwanted girl child, the Shavepate\nclaimed. The Sons of the Harpy might have done it, and made it look like\ndragon\u2019s work to make the city hate me. Dany wanted to believe that \u2026 but if\nthat was so, why had Hazzea\u2019s father waited until the audience hall was almost\nempty to come forward? If his purpose had been to inflame the Meereenese\nagainst her, he would have told his tale when the hall was full of ears to\nhear.</i></p><p><i>The Shavepate had urged her to put the man to death.\n\u201cAt least rip out his tongue. This man\u2019s lie could destroy us all,\nMagnificence.\u201d Instead Dany chose to pay the blood price. No one could\ntell her the worth of a daughter, so she set it at one hundred times the worth\nof a lamb. <b>\u201cI would give Hazzea back to you if I could,\u201d she told the\nfather, \u201cbut some things are beyond the power of even a queen. Her bones shall be laid to rest in the\nTemple of the Graces, and a hundred candles shall burn day and night in her\nmemory. Come back to me each year upon her nameday, and your other children\nshall not want \u2026 but this tale must never pass your lips again.\u201d </b>\u2013\nDaenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This quote shows that Dany is smart\nand capable of analysing the situation to conclude that Hazzea\u2019s father was\ntelling the truth. She knows that she has to keep the tale from spreading, but\nshe also understands that it\u2019s important to be fair to her people, so she\nchooses to be kind and be just to Hazzea\u2019s father.</p><p>With all of this being said, I think\nDany has many qualities of a great ruler.</p><p><b>DANY\u2019S CHANGING POLITICAL VIEWS</b></p><p>Thanks to Dany\u2019s ability for\nself-reflection, Dany changes her political views throughout the story due to\nher experiences. She starts the story as a very na\u00efve girl who doesn\u2019t truly\nunderstands the costs of war and conquest, asking her husband to invade the\nSeven Kingdoms without really realizing what the consequences would be. First,\nshe tries to convince Drogo several times, unsuccessfully. Then, the wineseller tries to\npoison her and Drogo decides to cross the narrow sea. He attacks the Lhazareen\nto pay for the ships, and Dany finally sees the consequences of her actions:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>Slaves, Dany thought.</b>\nKhal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver\u2019s Bay. <b>She\nwanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. This is war, this\nis what it looks like, this is the price of the\u00a0Iron\u00a0Throne.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys VII AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>But\nDany is unable to ignore the horror, and two paragraphs later, she tries to put\na stop at least to the rapes, with the little power she has. She defies\nDothraki culture and Drogo\u2019s men, putting herself at risk:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Behind\u00a0them,\nthe girl being raped made a heartrending sound,</i></b><i> a long sobbing wail\nthat went on and on and on. Dany\u2019s hand clenched hard around the reins, and she\nturned the silver\u2019s head. <b>\u201cMake\u00a0them\u00a0stop,\u201d\nshe commanded Ser Jorah.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VII AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>Later, Dany reflects on what she\nthinks is acceptable in war and conquest, trying to be pragmatic but without\nunnecessary bloodshed:</p><blockquote><p><i>Blood\u00a0and fire, thought Dany. The words of House\nTargaryen. She had known them all her life. <b>\u201cThe\u00a0blood\u00a0of my enemies I will shed gladly.\nThe\u00a0blood\u00a0of\u00a0innocents\u00a0is another matter.</b> Eight\nthousand Unsullied they would offer me. Eight thousand dead babes. Eight\nthousand strangled dogs.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she\ncorrected. \u201cPrince Rhaegar led free men into battle, not slaves.\nWhitebeard said he dubbed his squires himself, and made many other knights as\nwell.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThere was no higher honor than to receive your\nknighthood from the\u00a0Prince\u00a0of\u00a0Dragonstone.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cTell me, then\u2014when he touched\na man on the shoulder with his sword, what did he say? \u2018Go forth and kill the\nweak\u2019? Or 'Go forth and defend them\u2019?</i></b><i> At the\nTrident, those brave men Viserys spoke of who died beneath our dragon\nbanners\u2014did they give their lives because they believed in Rhaegar\u2019s cause, or\nbecause they had been bought and paid for?\u201d Dany turned to Mormont,\ncrossed her arms, and waited for an answer. \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Another thing that changes are her\nviews on slavery. Dany starts as someone who lives in a slave society and has\nno strong feelings against slavery. While she was living with Illyrio, she had\nslaves serving her, and with the Dothraki, she had slave servants as well.\nBut as soon as Drogo dies, Dany frees her slaves.<i> </i>Even then, while Dany no longer has slaves herself, she has no\nstrong feelings about the slaves in Qarth, and even considers buying a slave\narmy. But when Dany sees the horrors in Astapor and understands what slavery\ntruly means, she turns away from it:</p><blockquote><p><i>Xaro\u00a0caught it in the air and took a bite. \u201cWhence\ncame this madness? Should I count myself fortunate that you did not free my\nown\u00a0slaves\u00a0when you were my guest in Qarth?\u201d</i></p><p><i>I was a beggar queen and you were Xaro of the Thirteen, Dany\nthought, and all you wanted were my dragons. <b>\u201cYour slaves seemed well treated and content. It was not till\nAstapor that my eyes were opened. Do you know how Unsullied are made and\ntrained?\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And despite being raised by Viserys,\nDany was able to think on her on view on what a king should be, and what are\nher duties as a monarch:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI was alone for a long time, Jorah. All alone but for\nmy brother. I was such a small scared thing. <b>Viserys should have protected me, but instead he hurt me and scared me\nworse. He shouldn\u2019t have done that. He wasn\u2019t just my brother, he was my king.\nWhy do the gods make kings and queens, if not to protect the ones who can\u2019t\nprotect themselves?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSome kings make\nthemselves.\u00a0Robert\u00a0did.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe was no true king,\u201d Dany said scornfully.\n\u201cHe did no justice. <b>Justice \u2026\nthat\u2019s what kings are for.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>A\u00a0queen\u00a0belongs\u00a0not\nto herself but to her people.</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys was only able to change her\nviews and become a more conscious ruler because of her self-reflection and\nempathy, and this is one of the things that sets her apart as a leader. With\nall that being said, let\u2019s see Dany\u2019s journey in each of the books.</p><p><b>FINDING HER WAY IN THE WORLD</b></p><p>The first two books are, in my\nopinion, about Daenerys finding out what she wants and what to do. It\u2019s the\nbeginning of her journey as a leader, and she\u2019s going on instinct, trying to\nfind out what to do.</p><p><b>A GAME OF THRONES</b></p><p>People usually look at this book as\nthe story of a scared little girl overcoming abuse and becoming stronger. This\nis all true, but this is also the book where Dany starts to develop her\nleadership skills. In this book, Dany learns how to be more assertive and how\nto deal with this new authority that is given to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWait here,\u201d\nDany told Ser Jorah. <b>\u201cTell them all\nto stay. Tell them I command it.\u201d</b></i><i></i></p><p><i>The knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had\na neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and\nchest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his smiles gave\nDany comfort. <b>\u201cYou are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cNot a\u00a0queen,\u201d said Dany.\n\u201cA\u00a0khaleesi.\u201d </b>She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the\nridge alone. \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>Unlike Viserys, Dany learns about\nDothraki culture and adapts to it. This allows her to gain more respect than\nher brother:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>Take</b>\u00a0<b>his</b>\u00a0<b>horse</b>,\u201d\nDany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he\nwas hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words\ncame. <b>\u201cLet my brother walk behind\nus back to the khalasar.\u201d Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride\nwas no man at all, the lowest of the low, without honor or pride. \u201cLet\neveryone see him as he is.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany understands that Dothraki\nculture strongly associates strength with the ability to ride. So she makes a\nconscious choice to show all of the khalasar what Viserys really is, showing\nherself stronger than her brother. And we start to see just how much Viserys\nignorance is detrimental to his potential ability to lead the Dothraki:</p><blockquote><p><i>(\u2026) <b>the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal\nRhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King. Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the\nnext day, and Viserys had accepted. In his stubborn ignorance, he had not even\nknown he was being mocked</b>; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women\ngiving birth, the very young and the very old. That won him yet another name:\nKhal\u00a0Rhaggat, the Cart King. Her brother had thought it was the khal\u2019s way\nof apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah not to\ntell him the truth, lest he be shamed. \u2013 </i>Daenerys\nIV AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Because Viserys refuses to learn and\nadapt to other cultures, he loses respects, while Dany gains the respect of the\nDothraki. She respects their culture and shows her strength by eating the\nstallion\u2019s horse, riding with them until the end of her pregnancy, and\nasserting herself.</p><p>This new authority that Dany gains\nalso means that Dany sees herself more and more free of her brother\u2019s\ninfluence. She gets the chance of getting a new perspective on Westeros through\nJorah, without her brother\u2019s biases:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cThe common people pray for\nrain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,\u201d</i></b><i> Ser Jorah told her. <b>\u201cIt\nis no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as\nthey are left in peace.\u201d </b>He gave a shrug. <b>\u201cThey never are.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a\npuzzle box. <b>It went against everything\nthat Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little\nwhether a true\u00a0king\u00a0or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she\nthought on Jorah\u2019s words, the more they rang of truth. </b>\u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>She talks with Jorah about if it\nwould be possible for the Dothraki to conquer Westeros, trying to gather the\ninformation that she\u2019ll need, and even starts believing that someone else could\nconquer the Seven Kingdoms (herself):</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany could not pretend\nto surprise at the disdain in his tone. </i><b><i>\u201cWhat\n\u2026 what if it were not Viserys?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf it were someone else\nwho led them? Someone stronger? Could the Dothraki\u00a0truly\u00a0conquer\u00a0the\u00a0Seven\u00a0Kingdoms?\u201d</i> </b>- Daenerys IV AGOT<b><i></i></b></p></blockquote><p>This is also the book in which Dany\nstarts dealing with the many moral dilemmas that she encounters in her story:\nshe wants to conquer the Seven Kingdoms, but once she sees that Drogo attacks\nthe Lhazareen to fund the invasion, she sees the costs of war for the first\ntime, and stands up to Drogo\u2019s men to protect the women from being raped.\nLater, after Drogo dies, Dany frees her slaves and asks people to follow her,\npromising to protect them and care for them:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYou will be my khalasar,\u201d she told them. <b>\u201cI see the faces of\u00a0slaves. I\nfree you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one shall harm you. If you\nstay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.\u201d</b> The\nblack eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. \u201cI see the children, women,\nthe wrinkled faces of the aged. I was a child yesterday. Today I am a woman.\nTomorrow I will be old. <b>To each of you I\nsay, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for\nyou.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys X AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>But it\u2019s important to note that even\nthough Dany has more power than she starts the book with, for most of the book,\nthe power is not truly hers, it comes from Drogo. Before Dany hatches her\ndragons, she has to use Drogo\u2019s name to make herself be obeyed, and has to\nresort to things like bed tricks. Even then, she is not always successful. I\nthink it\u2019s very interesting that before Dany truly has her own power, she has\nto deal with what any woman would have to deal \u2013 trying to manipulate her\nhusband to have power and get what she wants. It\u2019s only at the end of the book\nthat Dany steps up as khaleesi in her own right. Initially, Aggo, Jhogo and\nRakharo refuse to follow her because she\u2019s a woman, but Dany insists, because\nshe knows that when she steps out of the fire and shows her strength, the\nkhalasar will follow her:</p><blockquote><p><i>Wordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her khas\ncame up behind him. Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet.\n\u201cBlood of my blood,\u201d he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking\nearth. \u201cBlood of my blood,\u201d she heard Aggo echo. \u201cBlood of my\nblood,\u201d Rakharo shouted.</i></p><p><i>And after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all\nthe Dothraki, men and women and children, and <b>Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now,\ntoday and tomorrow and\u00a0forever, hers as they had never been Drogo\u2019s.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys X AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>A Game of Thrones is an essential\npart of Dany\u2019s growth as a leader. She learns that to be respected and\naccepted, she needs to integrate into the community and understand the culture\nthat she is in. She gains a new perspective on Westeros and on war, frees\nherself from Viserys\u2019 abuse, and builds the necessary strength and confidence\nto lead her people in the future.</p><p><b>A CLASH OF KINGS</b></p><p>Now, for the first time in her life,\nDany has power on her own, and people look up to her for guidance. To survive\nthe Red Waste, Dany leads by showing an example of strength:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>They\nare not strong, she told herself, so\u00a0I\u00a0must\u00a0be their\u00a0strength.</i></b><i>\u00a0<b>I\u00a0must\u00a0show no fear, no weakness,\nno doubt.</b> However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face\nthey\u00a0must\u00a0see only Drogo\u2019s queen. She felt older than her fourteen\nyears. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was done. \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nkeeps her people together by respecting their culture and traditions:</p><blockquote><p><i>Three days into the march, the first man died. A toothless\noldster with cloudy blue eyes, he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not\nrise again. An hour later he was done. Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and\ncarried his ill luck to the living. \u201cHis time was past,\u201d her handmaid\nIrri declared. \u201cNo man should live longer than his teeth.\u201d The others\nagreed. <b>Dany bid them kill the weakest\nof their dying\u00a0horses, so the dead man might go mounted into the night\nlands.</b></i></p><p><i>Two nights later, it was an infant girl who perished. Her\nmother\u2019s anguished wailing lasted all day, but there was nothing to be done. <b>The child had been too young to ride, poor\nthing. Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands; she must be born\nagain.</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She also leads them and keeps them\ntogether by showing that she cares about them. She doesn\u2019t see herself above\nher people, and because of this, she starves with them and cares for them:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\nhungered and thirsted with the rest of them.</i></b><i> The milk in her breasts dried up, her nipples\ncracked and bled, and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was\nlean and hard as a stick, yet it was her dragons she feared for.\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Doreah\u00a0took a\nfever and grew worse with every league they crossed. Her lips and hands broke\nwith blood blisters, her hair came out in clumps, and one evenfall she lacked\nthe strength to mount her horse. Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to\nher saddle, but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea, when the Lysene\ngirl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more. <b>She gave\u00a0Doreah\u00a0water from her\nown skin, cooled her brow with a damp cloth, and held her hand until she died,\nshivering. Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on.</b> \u2013 Daenerys\nI ACOK</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>She keeps them alive by being\npragmatic, like when she insists in entering the abandoned city, breaking the\ntaboo of the Dothraki against such places because they need food:</p><blockquote><p><i>Other searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees,\nhidden behind closed doors in secret gardens. Aggo showed her a courtyard\novergrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes, and Jhogo discovered a\nwell where the water was pure and cold. Yet they found bones too, the skulls of\nthe unburied dead, bleached and broken. \u201cGhosts,\u201d Irri muttered.\n\u201cTerrible ghosts. We must not stay here, Khaleesi, this is their\nplace.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI fear no ghosts. Dragons are\nmore powerful than ghosts.\u201d And\u00a0figs\u00a0are more important.</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>And she saves her people by making\nthe sensible choice of sending her bloodriders in different directions to find\na way out of the desert:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhat shall we seek, Khaleesi?\u201d asked Jhogo.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhatever there is,\u201d Dany answered. \u201cSeek for\nother\u00a0cities, living and dead. Seek for caravans and people. Seek for\nrivers and lakes and the great salt sea. Find how far this waste extends before\nus, and what lies on the other side. <b>When\nI leave this place, I do not mean to strike out blind again. I will know where\nI am bound, and how best to get there.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>All of these actions enabled her to\nkeep her khalasar together and keep their loyalty. And after many deaths and\nsuffering, they finally get to Qarth.</p><p>But when they arrive in Qarth, there\nare more challenges. Dany thinks that she\u2019ll find something in the city:</p><blockquote><p><i>The\u00a0Bleeding\u00a0Star\u00a0led\nme to Qarth for a purpose. <b>Here I will\nfind what I need, if I have the strength to take what is offered, and the\nwisdom to avoid the traps and snares.</b> If the gods mean for me to conquer,\nthey will provide, they will send me a sign, and if not \u2026 if not \u2026 \u2013\nDaenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>And this quote establishes Dany\u2019s\narc in this book very well, because this part of her story is a test for\nher as a leader, and she learns some important lessons. She has to escape\ndifferent deceptions, and Dany is careful about that. Even with all their\nflatteries, she doesn\u2019t trust Xaro and Pyat Pree, and takes precautions against\nthem:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI do not understand her.\u201d Pyat and Xaro had\nshowered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her\u00a0dragons,\ndeclaring themselves her loyal servants in all things, but from Quaithe she had\ngotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never seen\nthe woman\u2019s face. Remember Mirri Maz Duur, she told herself. <b>Remember treachery. She turned to her\nbloodriders. \u201cWe will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that\nno one enters this wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that\nthe\u00a0dragons\u00a0are always well\u00a0guarded.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt shall be done, Khaleesi,\u201d Aggo said.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWe have seen only the parts of\nQarth that\u00a0Pyat\u00a0Pree wished us to see,\u201d she went on.\n\u201cRakharo, go forth and look on the rest, and tell me what you find. Take\ngood men with you\u2014and women, to go places where men are forbidden.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cAs you say, I do, blood of my blood,\u201d said\nRakharo.</i>\n\u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Later,\nDany also escapes treachery by refusing to fall for Xaro\u2019s bad deal (he had\noffered her 30 ships for one dragon):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI\nam trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in\nthe\u00a0world.\u201c Dany smiled at him sweetly. \"It seems to me that\none-third of all the\u00a0ships\u00a0in the\u00a0world\u00a0would be\nfair.\u201d</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso sends Jorah to find out about news from Westeros and to find ships that\ncould take them:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cSer\nJorah, find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor. It has been\nhalf a year since I last heard tidings from the Seven Kingdoms. Perhaps the\ngods will have blown some good captain here from Westeros with a ship to carry\nus home.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>The knight frowned. \u201cThat would be no kindness. The\nUsurper will kill you, sure as sunrise.\u201d Mormont hooked his thumbs through\nhis swordbelt. \u201cMy\u00a0place\u00a0is here at\u00a0your\u00a0side.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cJhogo can guard me as well. <b>You have more languages than my bloodriders, and the Dothraki mistrust\nthe sea and those who sail her. Only you can serve me in this.</b> Go among the\nships and speak to the crews, learn where they are from and where they are\nbound and what manner of men command them.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>The interesting thing here is that\nDany can see the strengths in each of her men and can use them accordingly. She\nknows that Ser Jorah is the most adequate person to entrust this task to, and\nthis shows her abilities as a leader, because a leader must know the people under her command.</p><p>Dany is not only trying to escape\ndeception, but she\u2019s also trying to get help to conquer Westeros. She tries to\nbribe the Pureborn and follow Qartheen traditions, but it doesn\u2019t work. Soon,\nDany starts to realize that she won\u2019t find help to conquer Westeros as a beggar:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Yet\neven crowned, I am a\u00a0beggar\u00a0still, Dany thought.</i></b><i> I have become the most\nsplendid\u00a0beggar\u00a0in the world, but a\u00a0beggar\u00a0all the same.\nShe hated it, as her brother must have. All those years of running from city to\ncity one step ahead of the Usurper\u2019s knives, pleading for help from archons and\nprinces and magisters, buying our food with flattery. He must have known how\nthey mocked him. Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter. In the end it had\ndriven him mad. It will do the same to me if I let it. Part of her would have\nliked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro, and make the\ndead city bloom. No, that is defeat. I have something Viserys never had. I have\nthe dragons. The dragons are all the difference. \u2013 Daenerys III ACOK</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Qarth is also important for Dany\u2019s\narc as a leader because it\u2019s a place of temptation. Qarth is a city filled with\nsplendors: it\u2019s beautiful, it has magic, it\u2019s wealthy. And both Xaro and Pyat\nPree are offering them to Dany. If she stays with Pyat Pree, she will have\nsorceries and magical knowledge at her disposal. If she stays with Xaro, she\nwill be a wealthy woman for the rest of her life. But if she does that, she\nwill have to stay in Qarth forever and will never achieve her true desire, to\ngo home to Westeros. This is a moment in her arc in which Dany has to decide\nwhat she truly wants: does she want a life of luxury or does she want to pursue\na greater destiny for herself? In the end, Dany decides to leave Qarth and make\nher own path.</p><p>In this book, Dany has successfully\nled her people through the desert through strength, pragmatism and determination, and has\nescaped Qarth because of her cleverness. She has also finally decided what she\nwants for herself:</p><blockquote><p><i>Three heads has the dragon, Dany thought, wondering. <b>\u201cI shall tell my people to make ready\nto depart at once. But the ships that bring me home must bear different\nnames.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d said Arstan.\n\u201cWhat\u00a0names\u00a0would you\u00a0prefer?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cVhagar,\u201d Daenerys told\nhim. \u201cMeraxes. And Balerion. Paint the names on their hulls in golden\nletters three feet high, Arstan. I want every man who sees them to know the\ndragons are returned.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p><b>SHAPING THE WORLD</b></p><p>The\nthird and fifth book are the ones in which Dany starts to more actively shape\nthe world around her. While in the first two books, Dany is leading through her\nstrength, adaptation to culture, instinct and pragmatism, now she finally\nstarts to deal with more complex issues. She no longer leads a small khalasar \u2013\nshe has to deal with big armies and thousands of different and diverse people.\nShe\u2019s no longer just defying Dothraki tradition \u2013 she is fighting against a\ncontinent wide system of slavery. She has to deal with military strategy, food,\ntrade, diplomacy, peace and war, and this is the moment in which Dany grows the\nmost, reflects on what is means to be a ruler, and on what it means to be a revolutionary.</p><p><b>A STORM OF SWORDS</b></p><p>In\nthis book, we see both Dany\u2019s brilliance and inexperience. She has huge\nvictories, but also makes huge mistakes.</p><p>The\nbook starts with Dany going to Illyrio, until Jorah points out that going there\nwithout an army would be risky. He convinces Dany to go to Astapor to buy the\nUnsullied. There, she sees the horrors of slavery and decides to start her\nliberation of the slaves.</p><p>In\neach of the cities, Dany makes brilliant plans. In Astapor, Dany pretends that\nshe doesn\u2019t speak Valyrian, at Ser Jorah\u2019s suggestion, to get to hear what\nKraznis doesn\u2019t want her to hear. But she also sets in motion a plan that she\ncreates all on her own: she asks Jorah how Astapor is defended, and later asks\nMissandei if the things Kraznis told her were true, to get more information\nbefore she acts. Then, she uses a Qartheen dress look more wealthy, and\nsuccessfully negotiates with the slavers, managing to buy all of the Unsullied\nso that her plan can work. She refuses to let Ser Barristan undermine her,\nordering him to be taken away from her presence when he speaks out of turn.\nWhile setting her plan in motion, she dresses in Dothraki clothes and puts the\nweakest of her people inside the column, with the warriors outside, in order to\nappear more intimidating. And before she turns on the masters, she makes sure\nto tell the Unsullied that she has paid for them, and they belong to her now,\nso that they know they no longer have to be loyal to the Astapori masters. It\nwas a very risky plan, and if it failed, Dany and all of her people would have\ndied. But Dany took all the steps necessary for it to be a success.</p><p>In\nYunkai, she tells the sellswords that she wants answers to her offers on the\nnext day, gives the Second Sons wine to get them drunk, and tells the Yukish\nenvoy that they have three days to think. Then, she organizes a surprise\nattack, defeating the sellsword companies almost with no bloodshed and with\neven fewer losses on her side.</p><p>In\nMeereen, Dany doesn\u2019t have surprise on her side, since the Meereenese have come\nto expect an attack and hid behind their walls. She understands the necessity\nof facing Meereen\u2019s champion (\u201cIf I\u00a0ignore\u00a0this any longer, my own\npeople will think me\u00a0weak\u201d \u2013 Daenerys V ASOS), but carefully chooses who\nwill face this champion:</p><blockquote><p><b>Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo were brave warriors, but they were young, and too valuable to risk. They kept her khalasar together, and were her best scouts too.</b> - Daenerys V ASOS<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his city I want, not his meager manhood.\u201d She was growing angry, however. <b>If I ignore this any longer, my own people will think me weak.</b> <b>Yet who could she send? She needed Daario as much as she did her bloodriders. Without the flamboyant Tyroshi, she had no hold on the Stormcrows, </b>many of whom had been followers of Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor the Bald. - Daenerys V ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>Once again, Dany shows\nherself as a capable leader, one that understands the importance and strengths\nof each men under her command. So she ends up sending Belwas, reasoning that:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cStrong\u00a0Belwas\u00a0was\na slave here in the fighting pits. <b>If this\u00a0highborn\u00a0Oznak should fall\nto such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if he wins \u2026 well, it is a\npoor victory for one so noble</b>, one that Meereen can take no pride in.\u201d <b>And\nunlike Ser Jorah, Daario, Brown Ben, and her three bloodriders, the eunuch did\nnot lead troops, plan battles, or give her counsel. </b>He does nothing but eat and\nboast and bellow at Arstan.\u00a0<b>Belwas\u00a0was the man she could most easily\nspare. And it was time she learned what sort of protector Magister Illyrio had\nsent her.</b> </i>\u2013 Daenerys V ASOS</p></blockquote><p>She\nalso takes care of Belwas, which is good to show her people that she cares\nabout them. But this is not enough to take the city, of course. The Meereenese\nburnt all the trees, so Dany can\u2019t build siege weapons. There are heads of harpies\nabove the gates to pour boiling oil, and she doesn\u2019t have enough food to feed\nher people (and can\u2019t take it from land, since the slavers burned the trees). Her\nadvisors tell her to leave Meereen behind and go to Westeros, and let her\npeople starve on the march. But Dany refuses to leave her people to die, and\nshe refuses to unnecessarily waste the lives of the Unsullied to assault the\nwalls under attack of boiling oil. Instead, Dany shows her resourcefulness \u2013\nshe makes siege weapons out of the ships that Illyrio sent her, and sends\nsoldiers to strike the chains of the slaves in the pits so they could also help\nher take the city from within.</p><p>Dany\nproves herself to be very intelligent, showing creativeness, resourcefulness,\nunderstanding of the different people that serve her and how each can be useful\nfor her, understanding of the need to keep up appearances and manipulate\npeople\u2019s perceptions, and showing that she cares for her people. But\nintelligence alone isn\u2019t enough. This book is also the one in which we see how\nher naivety, inexperience and lack of education impacts badly on her, and leads\nher to make mistakes.</p><p>In\nAstapor, she doesn\u2019t leave any army behind to protect the city. Because of\nthat, the council that she left governing is easily overthrown by the Butcher\nKing. In Yunkai, she doesn\u2019t really conquer the city, and leaves the masters\nstill in power. Then, as soon as she leaves, the masters enslave everyone\nagain. These mistakes also have serious consequences for Dany\u2019s future reign in\nMeereen: because of them, Dany will later have to deal with Astapori refugees, a plague, and with the city of Yunkai making alliances against her and besieging her\ncity.</p><p>These\nare mistakes that show her inexperience, and lack of formal education, but they\nalso show that Dany had bad advisors: both Jorah and Barristan don\u2019t really\ncare about Dany\u2019s anti-slavery campaign. They constantly tell her that she has\nnothing to gain here, and that she should just go to Westeros. Because none of\nthem is interested in ending slavery, they don\u2019t warn Dany about the mistakes\nthat she is making: they don\u2019t advise her to leave an army in Astapor, and they\ndon\u2019t tell her what\u2019s going to happen when she leaves Yunkai. Both of them are\nmore educated and experienced than her, and yet they tell her nothing.</p><p>Another\nthing that has consequences in the future is the question of bad faith. Dany\ndoes care about being honorable and upholding certain deals:</p><blockquote><p><i>Strong Belwas drew his\narakh. \u201cStrong Belwas will give his ugly tongue to the little queen, if\nshe likes.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo,\nBelwas. I have given these men my safe conduct.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>But at the same time, Dany\u2019s battle plans in Astapor and\nYunkai both involved deceit, and she also uses her dragons to intimidate an\nenvoy. This deceit was necessary, though: Dany starts with no army, and she\u2019s\nat a disadvantage when dealing with the slavers. It was certainly the right\nthing to do, and the best she could do in her circumstances. But of course, it\nwill still have consequences in the future, during her efforts to make peace,\nbecause the slavers don\u2019t trust her:<i></i></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAh, there is the thorn in the bower, my queen,\u201d\nsaid Hizdahr zo Loraq. <b>\u201cSad to say,\nYunkai has no faith in your promises. They keep plucking the same string on the\nharp, about some envoy that your dragons set on fire.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cOnly his\u00a0tokar\u00a0was\u00a0burned,\u201d said\nDany scornfully.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cBe that as it may, they do not\ntrust you.</i></b><i> The men of New Ghis feel the same.\nWords are wind, as you yourself have so oft said. No words of yours will secure\nthis peace for Meereen. Your foes require deeds. They would see us wed, and\nthey would see me crowned as king, to rule beside you.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys\ncan\u2019t unmake her mistakes. But thankfully, she learns from them. She refuses\nto leave Meereen behind, like she did in Astapor and Yunkai. And later in the\nnext book, Dany is very mindful of what might happen to her city if she takes\nher army away, showing that she learned from her mistake in Astapor:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI know that the Mother of Dragons will not abandon us\nin our hour of peril. Lend us your Unsullied to defend our walls.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>And if I do, who\nwill\u00a0defend\u00a0my\u00a0walls?</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys\nIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Westeros.\nHome. But if she left, what would happen to her city?</i></b><i> - Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMeet the\nfoe,\u201d she echoed, \u201cwith the freedmen you\u2019ve called half-trained and\nunblooded.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe were all\nunblooded once, Your Grace. The Unsullied will help stiffen them. If I had five\nhundred knights \u2026\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOr\nfive. And if I give you the Unsullied, I will have no one but the Brazen Beasts\nto hold Meereen.\u201d</i></b><i>\nWhen Ser Barristan did not dispute her, Dany closed her eyes. Gods, she prayed,\nyou took Khal Drogo, who was my sun-and-stars. You took our valiant son before\nhe drew a breath. You have had your blood of me. Help me now, I pray you. Give\nme the wisdom to see the path ahead and the strength to do what I must to keep\nmy children safe. - Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso understands her mistakes in leaving Yunkai untaken and leaving the masters\nin power:</p><blockquote><p><i>His new Unsullied are\nan obscene jape. \u201cKing Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens and let\nthe Yunkai'i tend theirs.\u201d It was not that Dany harbored any love\nfor\u00a0Yunkai. <b>She was coming to\nregret leaving the Yellow City untaken after defeating its army in the field.\nThe Wise Masters had returned to slaving as soon as she moved on, and were busy\nraising levies, hiring sellswords, and making alliances against her.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Overall, I think this book is great\nto show us just how smart Dany is: she seeks different sources of information\nin Astapor, listens to Ser Barristan\u2019s lessons in military matters, makes\nbrilliant plans that minimize bloodshed, knows her men and how to use each of\nthem, and punishes rapists and murderers in her army after the sack of Meereen.\nBut this book also strips Dany of her initial naivety, and she realizes that\nconquering and ruling are not the same thing. She realizes that she needs\nexperience. And we see, once again, one of Dany\u2019s greatest qualities: her\nself-reflection and willingness to learn. She decides to stay, learn how to be\na ruler and take responsibility for her actions.</p><p><b>A DANCE WITH DRAGONS</b></p><p>ASOS\nis, in my opinion, the book in which Dany makes the most mistakes, leading to\nthe consequences that I already described. But I also think that we shouldn\u2019t\nlook at her mistakes in ASOS and say that this means that Dany is an awful\nruler. Because it\u2019s more than understandable why she makes these mistakes. She\nhas no education or experience. It would be unrealistic if she knew everything\nshe had to do from the start.</p><p>So\nin ADWD, Dany has to deal with the mistakes she has already made, because she\ncan\u2019t unmake them, she can\u2019t go back in time to fix them. She also has to deal\nwith a lot of situations that are completely out of her control. In my opinion,\nwhile Dany made big mistakes in Astapor and Yunkai, she dealt very well with\nthe situation in Meereen, considering her circumstances. So let\u2019s dive into it.\nMeereen\u2019s storyline is very complex, so I\u2019ll deal with different aspects of it\nin different sections.</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b><br></li></ul><p>People\ncriticize Daenerys for several things: because \u201cshe destroyed the economy\u201d,\nbecause \u201cshe should have a plan before she took the city to stop the economy\nfrom collapsing\u201d and \u201cshe didn\u2019t do anything to establish a new economy without\nslavery\u201d. So let\u2019s address these criticisms.</p><p><b>\u201cShe destroyed the\neconomy\u201d</b></p><p>Let\u2019s\nlook at everything we know about Meereen\u2019s economy:</p><p>Their\nmain export are slaves. Astapor produces soldiers, Yunkai produces bed slaves,\nand Meereen produces bedslaves, teachers and artisans.</p><p>Aside\nfrom slaves, Meereen also has olives, salt, wine and copper. In the\nhinterlands, slaves grow wheat and olives, herd sheep and goats, and mine salt\nand copper. But even though Meereen produces other things beyond slaves, they\nare not enough to sustain the economy, and Meereen\u2019s economy is based mostly on\nslavery:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Without\nslaves,\u00a0Meereen\u00a0had little to offer traders. </i></b><i>\u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>When\nDany ends slavery, this means that she no longer has slaves to sell. And the\nslavers burnt the olive trees and the best grape arbors before Dany came into\nthe city to stop her from building siege weapons. Copper is not a very valuable\nmetal and Meereen\u2019s wine is of an inferior vintage.</p><p>These\nthings aren\u2019t Dany\u2019s fault. Meereen didn\u2019t have a lot of things to trade aside\nfrom slaves, and she couldn\u2019t stop the masters from burning the olive trees and\nthe grape arbors. This means that Meereen\u2019s economy was already very poor (it was rich because of slavery, but poor in other things) before Dany even conquered the city.</p><p>And\nthere\u2019s also the fact that Dany is not the kind of person to leave her people\nbehind, so she lets the former slaves from Astapor and Yunkai come with her,\nwhich also means that she has more mouths to feed.</p><p>If\nDaenerys wants to end slavery, there\u2019s nothing she can do about the fact that\nthe economy will suffer if she no longer has slaves to sell. </p><p>There\nare also some problems that came with Dany\u2019s mistakes in Yunkai and Astapor.\nThe fact that Dany didn\u2019t take the masters out of power in Yunkai meant that,\nas soon as Dany left, they reenslaved people, and decided to attack Dany in\nMeereen, putting her city under siege. The Yunkish army surrounded her city\nfrom land, and Qartheen ships closed the bay, so she can\u2019t get trade, and\nfishers can\u2019t go into the bay. This is partly because of Dany\u2019s mistakes,\nbecause she left the masters of Yunkai in power. But as I\u2019ve said, Dany can\u2019t\ngo back in time to fix those mistakes, she can only deal with the consequences. And Dany would have to face opposition no\nmatter what she did. The powers of Essos would not simply accept Dany freeing\ntheir slaves and ruining their economy, and Dany also poses a symbolical\nthreat. So most likely, the economy of the city would suffer because of the war\nagainst the slavers, no matter what Dany did.</p><p>Ending\nslavery means disrupting the economy, there\u2019s no way around it.</p><p><b>\u201cShe should have a plan\nbefore she took the city to stop the economy from collapsing\u201d</b></p><p>I\u2019ve\nseen people suggest that Dany should have ended slavery gradually, or that she\nshould have waited to end slavery, so that she could first build a new economy,\nand only later free the slaves. But there are practical and ethical problems\nwith these suggestions.</p><p>Dany\nused the help of the slaves to take the city. While Dany was trying to take the\ncity from the outside, the slaves rose in revolt from the inside. Dany even\nsends part of her men to strike off the chains of the slaves in the fighting\npits. After taking the city with their help, Dany can\u2019t just tell the slaves\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to free you because of the economy, so you will have to wait\u201d.\nIf she did that, she would turn the slaves against her, and she would have both\nslaves and slavers trying to overthrow her. And if she did wait to free the\nslaves, she would probably have to compromise more with the slavers to be able\nto rule, and this would make it impossible for her to free the slaves later.</p><p>Besides,\n\u201cending slavery gradually\u201d is just inhumane. Take into consideration that every\nday, slaves are being raped, tortured, mutilated and overworked. If you think\nthat Daenerys should have ended slavery gradually, so that she could preserve\nthe economy and end slavery \u201cpeacefully\u201d, that only means that you care more\nabout the lives of the slavers and their livelihood than you care about the\nslaves.</p><p><b>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything\nto establish a new economy without slavery\u201d</b></p><p>Another\nbaseless accusation. Dany does a lot to rebuild Meereen\u2019s economy. She plants\nbeans, grapes, olives and wheat. She sends her khalasar to conquer the\nhinterlands and free the slaves there, and these former slaves are also\nplanting and bringing their crops to Meereen. The Green Grace had told Dany\nthat the soil of Meereen became infertile after the wars with the Valyrians, so\nshe starts to build a ditch to bring water to the plantations, showing how Dany\nis resourceful and how she is thinking in the long term, working on the\ninfrastructure of the city to make it agriculturally independent. She also\nsends Daario to Lhazar, to reopen the overland trade routes and bring grains\ninto the city. She negotiates with Xaro, hoping to trade the few things that Meereen\nhas to offer. And when the city is put under siege, Dany compromises and\nmarries Hizdahr, so that the siege can be lifted and she can have trade again.\nShe also has to deal with things like guilds of artisans, that don\u2019t want to\nallow freedmen into their business, so Dany has to demand that they open their\nrolls to the freedmen.</p><p>But\neven all of those things are not enough, because some things are simply\nimpossible. She can\u2019t make crops grow overnight and she doesn\u2019t have magical\nwagons to fly over the siege lines and deliver trade into her city. No matter\nhow good a ruler is, these things are just not possible. Rebuilding an economy\nafter ending slavery is extremely difficult and takes a long time, and GRRM\nwrote a very realistic story with Daenerys. You can\u2019t expect everything to be\nperfect after only a few months of Daenerys ruling. But her efforts here show\nthat she\u2019s a good and responsible ruler, and did everything she could to\nrebuild Meeren\u2019s economy.</p><ul><li><b>The war against Yunkai and the question of peace and war</b><br></li></ul><p>When\nDany conquers Meereen, she has seen the destruction that the war caused. Her\npeople are starving, and she has learned that she won\u2019t make things right just\nby freeing slaves and moving on from place to place. To make matters worse, she\nhas to deal with the terrorist organization The Sons of the Harpy, that are\nkilling freedmen, and even started killing her own soldiers. So it\u2019s no\nsurprise that with all of the slaughter and bloodshed, she wants peace more\nthan anything.</p><p>So\nDany starts making compromises with the slavers. These compromises involve\ndifferent things: she needs to marry Hizdahr, a powerful men who comes from one\nof the Great Master\u2019s families; she has to give indemnity in gold and gemstones to the slavers of Yunkai, as a compensation for disrupting the slave trade;\nshe has to allow slavery to return outside Meereen; she has to reopen the\nfighting pits; and she has to allow slavers from outside to bring their slaves into Meereen.</p><p>Many people accuse Dany of being\nstupid and naive for believing in Hizdahr and the peace, and not seeing that\nHizdahr is probably allied with the Sons of the Harpy. But this criticism is\nunfounded, because Dany does see that he\u2019s probably one of them:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cCan you?\u201d Dany studied his eyes. <b>\u201cWhy should the Sons of the Harpy lay\ndown their knives for you? Are you one of them?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWould you tell me if you\nwere?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>He laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d - Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany makes these compromises not\nbecause she\u2019s naive, but because at her core, she is someone who doesn\u2019t like\nwar and conflicts. But there\nare also practical reasons: after chaining her dragons, Dany doesn\u2019t have\nenough military power to defy the masters. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Dany just\nmeekly accepts anything. She insists on the freedom of the people in Meereen,\nshe insists in certain rules for the fighting pits (like not allowing children,\nslaves, and not allowing thieves and debtors to be forced to fight), she\ndemands that the guilds of Meereen allow freedmen, and she trains her own\nsoldier companies, because she wants to be prepared to defend her city:</p><blockquote><p><i>He\u00a0was\u00a0wrong\u00a0in\nthat, she hoped. The freedmen had been a rabble once, but <b>she had organized the men of fighting age into companies and commanded\nGrey Worm to make them into soldiers.</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso has Ser Barristan training some boys to be knights.</p><p>With\nthese actions, Dany achieves a shaky peace with Yunkai, and she gets the Sons\nof the Harpy to stop attacking. She prepares her city in the case of a war. She\nalso manages to make her conditions on who fights in the pits, and to make\nchanges in the laws of Meereen, like in the case of the guilds. I think it\u2019s\nimportant to acknowledge that Dany\u2019s course of action in Meereen was a sensible\none, and she did achieve some small victories.</p><p>But\nthis plot isn\u2019t just about seeing just how much Dany can accomplish as a ruler.\nIt\u2019s also meant for her to reflect and learn about what peace and war mean. She\nstarts the books as someone who was appalled by the costs of war, and tries\neverything she can to get peace. But as time goes, she realizes that her\nmerciful path has also caused problems. One example is when she reflects about\ncertain mistakes that she made, like leaving the slave masters in power:</p><blockquote><p><i>She had not forgotten\nthe slave children the\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters\u00a0had nailed up along the\nroad from\u00a0Yunkai. They had numbered one hundred sixty-three, a child every\nmile, nailed to mileposts with one arm outstretched to point her way. After\nMeereen had fallen, Dany had nailed up a like number\nof\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters. Swarms of flies had attended their slow dying, and\nthe stench had lingered long in the plaza. <b>Yet\nsome days she feared that she had not gone far enough. These Meereenese were a\nsly and stubborn people who resisted her at every turn. They had freed their\nslaves, yes \u2026 only to hire them back as servants at wages so meagre that most\ncould scarce afford to eat.</b> Those too old or young to be of use had been\ncast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled. And still\nthe\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters\u00a0gathered atop their lofty pyramids to complain\nof how the dragon queen had filled their noble city with hordes of unwashed\nbeggars, thieves, and whores. \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nstarts to question the costs of peace as well:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThere may be another choice. <b>The Yunkai'i can be persuaded to allow all your freedmen to remain\nfree, I believe, if Your Worship will agree that the Yellow City may trade and\ntrain slaves unmolested from this day forth. No more blood need flow.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSave\u00a0for the blood of\nthose slaves that the Yunkai'i will trade and train,\u201d</i></b><i> Dany said, but she recognized the truth in his words even\nso. It may be that is the best end we can hope for. \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHis Grace is\ndreaming, but <b>I cannot sleep. On the\nmorrow I must bathe in\u00a0blood. The price of peace.</b>\u201d \u2013 Daenerys\nVIII</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The Brazen Beasts did as they were bid. Dany watched them at\ntheir work. <b>\u201cThose bearers were\nslaves before I came. I made them free. Yet that palanquin is no lighter.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cTrue,\u201d said Hizdahr, \u201cbut those men\nare\u00a0paid\u00a0to\u00a0bear\u00a0its weight now. Before you came, that man\nwho fell would have an overseer standing over him, stripping the skin off his\nback with a whip. Instead he is being given aid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>It was true. A Brazen Beast in a boar mask had offered the\nlitter bearer a skin of water. <b>\u201cI\nsuppose I must be thankful for small victories,\u201d</b> the queen said. \u2013\nDaenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>They\nstamped their feet and slapped their bellies and shouted, \u201cMhysa, Mhysa,\nMhysa,\u201d </i></b><i>until\nthe whole pit seemed to tremble. Dany let the sound wash over her. <b>I am not\u00a0your\u00a0mother, she might\nhave shouted, back, I am the\u00a0mother\u00a0of\u00a0your\u00a0slaves, of\nevery boy who ever died upon these sands whilst you gorged on honeyed locusts.</b>\n\u2013 Daenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso realizes that this peace isn\u2019t truly sustainable, because she\u2019s in the\nhands of the slavers:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany scarce touched a bite. <b>This is peace, she told herself. This is what I wanted, what I worked\nfor, this is why I married Hizdahr. So why does it taste so much like defeat?</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is only for a little while more, my love,\u201d\nHizdahr had assured her. \u201cThe Yunkai'i will soon be gone, and their allies\nand hirelings with them.

But do it soon.\nIf Hizdahr\u2019s peace should break, I want to be ready.

Set\nPretty\u00a0Meris\u00a0free. At once.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nstarts to see that peace is not ideal like she had thought. And she starts to\nreflect if this peace is really worth it, and comes to the conclusion that it\nisn\u2019t:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cOne will die, or the other will,\u201d said Dany.\n\u201cAnd the one who lives will die some other day. <b>This was a\u00a0mistake.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cStrong Belwas ate too many locusts.\u201d There was a\nqueasy look on Belwas\u2019s broad brown face. \u201cStrong Belwas needs milk.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Hizdahr ignored the\neunuch. \u201cMagnificence, the people of Meereen have come to celebrate our\nunion. You heard them cheering you. Do not cast away their love.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cIt\nwas my floppy ears they cheered, not me. Take me from this abbatoir,\nhusband.\u201d</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This\nis as much about Dany reclaiming her identity as it is about her changing her\npolitical views. A peace that means that she has to give indemnity to slavers,\nwatch people fight to death, and let slavery continue is no true peace, because\nthousands and thousands of people will continue suffering the violence of\nslavery. And Dany doesn\u2019t want to be the kind of ruler that stands by while\ninjustice happens. So by the end of ADWD, she finally accepts fire and blood,\nwhich is necessary if she wants to end slavery once and for all.</p><p>I\nthink these reflections are necessary for Dany\u2019s learning. She needs\nto know when compromises are worth or not. She needs to learn how to be more\ndecisive to achieve the goals she has of social change. She needs to learn when\nto seek peace, and when to use Fire and Blood.</p><ul><li><b>The question of taking the wealth of the slave masters</b><br></li></ul><p>I\u2019ve\nseen many people in the fandom saying that Dany should have taken the wealth of\nthe slavers. I agree with that. If Dany had taken their wealth, they would no\nlonger be able to finance an opposition against her. She could redistribute\ntheir wealth to the former slaves, helping to minimize inequality, and she\ncould have used it to buy sellswords to fight for her. This way, she wouldn\u2019t\nhave to compromise as much as she did. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think this\nwould solve all of her problems. Because, as I said, the economy was mostly\nbased on slavery. It would still take time to rebuild the economy and base it\non something else. It would take time for Meereen to become agriculturally\nindependent and for Meereen to start producing new products for trade.</p><p>And\nit\u2019s understandable why Dany doesn\u2019t do this. First, because she has no\nexperience, and she needs to learn. It would make no sense to write a story\nabout Dany learning if she already knows everything she has to do from the\nstart. Also, because, as pointed out in the previous sections, Dany is trying\nto be moderate and conciliatory. And as someone who is highborn, Dany doesn\u2019t\nreally believe in the idea of depriving the nobility of what they possess, even\nif she\u2019s siding with the oppressed. Taking the nobility\u2019s wealth is something\nthat is very against everything Dany has been taught her entire life. So at the\nbeginning of the story, Dany doesn\u2019t want to be too radical. But that doesn\u2019t\nmean she\u2019s not smart and doesn\u2019t think about it. This is actually something\nthat Dany herself does, even though she doesn\u2019t do it enough:</p><blockquote><p><i>That brought a smile to the Shavepate\u2019s face. \u201cIt will\nbe done,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Your Radiance should know that the Great\nMasters of Zhak and Merreq are making preparations to quit their pyramids and\nleave the city.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Daenerys was sick unto death of Zhak and Merreq; she was\nsick of all the Mereenese, great and small alike. <b>\u201cLet them go, but see that they take no more than the clothes upon\ntheir backs. Make certain that all their\u00a0gold\u00a0remains here with us.\nTheir stores of food as well.\u201d </b>\u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\nlater, Daario too suggests it to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYou are fighting shadows when you should be fighting\nthe men who cast them,\u201d Daario went on. <b>\u201cKill them all and take their treasures, I say.</b> Whisper the\ncommand, and your Daario will make you a pile of their heads taller than\nthis\u00a0pyramid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf I knew who they were\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cZhak and Pahl and\nMerreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He is as bold as he is\nbloody. \u201cWe have no proof this is their work. Would you have me slaughter\nmy own subjects?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis reluctant. She\u2019s smart enough to realize that she needs to take the wealth of the masters, but she\u2019s not\nwilling to go too far (and she\u2019s even less willing to accept Daario\u2019s violent idea). But if the ending of ADWD is any indication, Dany has changed her stance, and won\u2019t be indecisive anymore.</p><ul><li><b>Conflicting interests within the city</b><br></li></ul><p>Even\nthough I think the compromises and the peace were a mistake, I think it\u2019s\npointless to look at what Dany should have done. We need to look at what she\ndecided to do. Dany decided to strive for peace, so I think that we should look\nat how she worked to achieve that.</p><p>At the start of Dany\u2019s reign, slaves\nand slavers want different things, and there are many problems that arose with\nthe sack: the slavers want punishment for the crimes during the sack, and the\nslaves want the masters punished for their past crimes against them. In face of\nthis, Dany chooses conciliation, pardoning the crimes during the sack and the\ncrimes the slavers committed before she took the city, not only out of\nclemency, but also out of pragmatism:</p><blockquote><p><i>A former slave came, to\naccuse a certain noble of the Zhak. The man had recently taken to wife a\nfreedwoman who had been the noble\u2019s bedwarmer before the\u00a0city\u00a0fell.\nThe noble had taken her maidenhood, used her for his pleasure, and gotten her with\nchild. Her new husband wanted the noble gelded for the crime of rape, and he\nwanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble\u2019s bastard as\nhis own. Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding. <b>\u201cWhen he lay with her, your wife was his property, to do with as\nhe would. By law, there was no rape.\u201d Her decision did not please him, she\ncould see, but if she gelded every man who ever forced a bedslave, she would\nsoon rule a\u00a0city\u00a0of\u00a0eunuchs.</b></i><b><i></i></b></p><p><i>A boy came, younger than Dany, slight and scarred, dressed\nup in a frayed grey tokar trailing silver fringe. His voice broke when he told\nof how two of his father\u2019s household slaves had risen up the night the gate\nbroke. One had slain his father, the other his elder brother. Both had raped\nhis mother before killing her as well. The boy had escaped with no more than\nthe scar upon his face, but one of the murderers was still living in his\nfather\u2019s house, and the other had joined the queen\u2019s soldiers as one of the\nMother\u2019s Men. He wanted them both hanged.</i></p><p><b><i>I am queen over a city built on dust\nand death.</i></b><i> <b>Dany had no choice but to deny him. She had declared\na\u00a0blanket\u00a0pardon\u00a0for all crimes committed during the sack. Nor\nwould she punish slaves for rising up against their masters.</b> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>After the sack of Meereen, Dany had\npunished rapists and murderers amongst her own soldiers:</p><blockquote><p><b>She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists their manhood. </b>Eight killers swung from the walls, and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms, but Meereen was calm again. - Daenerys VI ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>But in Meereen, she\ncan\u2019t control what the slaves do while rising against their masters, and\npunishing crimes committed during the sack would be impractical and give rise\nto lots of conflicts and anger from the former slaves against her. Similarly,\npunishing the former masters would be impractical as well. This decision shows\nDany\u2019s pragmatism, and it was important for keeping some semblance of peace in\nMeereen.</p><p>She also rules that a rich woman\nthat lost her house cannot have it back, but that she can have back her jewels\nand clothes. I\u2019ve seen many people criticize Dany for it, but the intention was\nclear and consistent with Dany\u2019s intentions in Meereen. Dany tries to be conciliatory,\ngranting the woman her clothes and jewels, but denying her the house, because\nthe alternative would mean that the former slaves occupying the house would be\nhomeless.</p><p>Another instance in which we can see\nDany being conciliatory is how she treats the problem of the guilds of artisans\nin Meereen:</p><blockquote><p><i>Her sleepless night soon made itself felt. Before long she\nwas fighting off a yawn as Reznak prattled about the craftsmen's\u00a0guilds.\nThe stonemasons were wroth with her, it seemed. The bricklayers as well. Certain\nformer slaves were carving stone and laying bricks, stealing work\nfrom\u00a0guild\u00a0journeymen and masters alike. \u201cThe freedmen work too\ncheaply, Magnificence,\u201d Reznak said. \u201cSome call themselves\njourneymen, or even masters, titles that belong by rights only to the craftsmen\nof the\u00a0guilds. The masons and the bricklayers do respectfully petition\nYour Worship to uphold their ancient rights and customs.\u201d<b></b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThe freedmen work cheaply\nbecause they are hungry,\u201d Dany pointed out. \u201cIf I forbid them to\ncarve stone or lay bricks, the chandlers, the weavers, and the goldsmiths will\nsoon be at my gates asking that they be excluded from those trades as\nwell.\u201d She considered a moment. \u201cLet it be written that henceforth\nonly guild members shall be permitted to name themselves journeymen or masters\n\u2026 provided the guilds open their rolls to any freedman who can demonstrate the\nrequisite skills.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany manages to partially pacify the\nguild members, saying that only them could name themselves journeymen or masters, while also keeping the freedmen in their trades and demanding\nthat they have a place in the guilds.</p><p>To keep the peace, Dany also adapts\nto Meereenese culture and traditions. She speaks their language:</p><blockquote><p><i>A small, damp man, he smelled as if he had bathed in perfume\nand <b>spoke a bastard form of High\nValyrian, much corrupted and flavored with a thick Ghiscari growl.</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYou are kind to say so,\u201d\nDany answered, in the same\u00a0tongue.</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys\nI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She wears the tokar, even though she\nunderstands what the garment symbolizes:</p><blockquote><p><i>Even wound properly, the\u00a0tokar required its wearer to\nhold it in place with the left hand. Walking in a\u00a0tokar\u00a0demanded\nsmall, mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy\ntrailing fringes. <b>It was not a garment\nmeant for any man who had to work. The\u00a0tokar\u00a0was a master\u2019s garment,\na sign of wealth and power.</b></i></p><p><b><i>Dany had wanted to ban the tokar\nwhen she took Meereen, but her advisors had convinced her otherwise. </i></b><i>\u201cThe Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever\nhated,\u201d warned the Green Grace, Galazza Galare. \u201cIn the wools of\nWesteros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall forever remain a\nstranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conqueror. Meereen\u2019s\nqueen must be a lady of Old Ghis.\u201d Brown Ben Plumm, the captain of the\nSecond Sons, had put it more succinctly. <b>\u201cMan\nwants to be the king o\u2019 the rabbits, he best wear a pair o\u2019 floppy ears.\u201d </b>\u2013\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This shows that Dany understands\nboth pros and cons of wearing the tokar. She understands that the garment is a\nsymbol of power. But as someone who\u2019s seeking peace, Dany chooses to wear it to\nbe conciliatory.</p><p>Another thing that she does is\nfollow the Meereenese marriage rites and religion, but with one exception:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMagnificence, you\ndo not understand,\u201d protested Reznak. <b>\u201cThe\u00a0washing\u00a0of\nthe\u00a0feet\u00a0is hallowed by tradition. It signifies that you shall be\nyour husband\u2019s handmaid.</b> The wedding garb is fraught with meaning too. The\nbride is dressed in dark red veils above a tokar of white silk, fringed with\nbaby pearls.\u201d</i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>A bride price paid in\nblood. Daenerys was weary of fighting this battle. Even Ser Barristan did not\nthink she could win. \u201cNo ruler can make a people good,\u201d Selmy had\ntold her. \u201cBaelor the Blessed prayed and fasted and built the Seven as\nsplendid a temple as any gods could wish for, yet he could not put an end to\nwar and want.\u201d A queen must listen to her people, Dany reminded herself.\n\u201cAfter the wedding Hizdahr will be king. Let him reopen the fighting pits\nif he wishes. I want no part of it.\u201d Let the blood be on his hands, not\nmine. She rose. \u201c<b>If my husband\nwishes me to\u00a0wash\u00a0his\u00a0feet, he must first\u00a0wash\u00a0mine.</b>\nI will tell him so this evening.\u201d She wondered how her betrothed would\ntake that. \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany understands that for the peace,\nshe must follow Meereenese traditions. But she also understands that as a woman\nin power, she can\u2019t afford to be seen as weak, so she can\u2019t be seen as \u201cher\nhusband\u2019s handmaid\u201d. Once again, Dany tries a conciliatory solution.</p><p>Courtesy is also important in\nkeeping the peace, and Dany does her best to be courteous even when she doesn\u2019t\nlike something:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the afternoon a\nsculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the\nPlaza of Purification with one cast in Dany\u2019s image. <b>She denied him with as much courtesy as she could muster.</b> A pike of\nunprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished\nto give it to the queen. <b>She admired the\nfish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, and sent the\npike to her kitchens.</b> A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished\nrings to wear to war. <b>She accepted it\nwith fulsome\u00a0thanks;</b> it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished\ncopper would flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she\nwould sooner be clad in steel. Even a young girl who knew nothing of the ways\nof war knew that. \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYour Grace need only ask him. The noble Hizdahr awaits below. Send down to him if that is your pleasure.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>You presume too much, priestess, the queen thought, but she swallowed her anger and made herself smile.</i></b><i> \u201cWhy not?\u201d She sent for Ser Barristan and told the old knight to bring Hizdahr to her. <b>\u201cIt is a long climb. Have the Unsullied help him up.\u201d </b>\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>He will be safer as a\nhostage. <b>My captain was not made\nfor\u00a0peace. Dany could not risk his cutting down Brown Ben Plumm, making\nmock of Hizdahr before the court, provoking the Yunkai'i, or otherwise\nupsetting the agreement that she had given up so much to win.</b> Daario was\nwar and woe. Henceforth, she must keep him out of her bed, out of her heart,\nand out of her. If he did not betray her, he would master her. She did not know\nwhich of those she feared the most. \u2013 VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nisn\u2019t always perfect. When dealing with Quentyn, she laughs at his story but\nforgets to explain the reason for her laugh in his language. But even though\nshe slips, Dany still makes an effort to be courteous with him:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cEnough,\u201d\nDaenerys said. \u201cPrince Quentyn has crossed half the world to offer me his\ngift, I will not have him treated with discourtesy.\u201d</i></b><i> She turned to the Dornishmen.\n\u201cWould that you had come a year ago. I am pledged to wed the noble Hizdahr\nzo Loraq.\u201d - Daenerys VII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\nlater, because of Dany\u2019s courtesy and kindness, he comes to like her and\nrespect her:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Daenerys\u00a0never\u00a0laughed.\nThe rest of Meereen might see him as an amusing curiosity,</i></b><i> like the exiled Summer Islander King\nRobert used to keep at King\u2019s Landing, <b>but\nthe queen had always spoken to him gently.</b> \u2013 The Spurned Suitor ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>All\nof this shows that Dany is good enough at her courtesies, even if she sometimes\nslips.</p><p>Finally,\nDany is not petty and does not treat people with brutality, even when they\noffend her, and that\u2019s very important, because she needs to avoid being hated\n(some people will hate her regardless of what she does, because she goes\nagainst their interests, but it\u2019s important that Dany shows herself to be a\nmerciful queen):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>When\nshe told him, the boy rushed at her,</i></b><i> but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went\nsprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The\nhuge brown eunuch yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a\nrat. <b>\u201cEnough, Belwas,\u201d Dany called.\n\u201cRelease him.\u201d To the boy she said, \u201cTreasure that tokar, for it\nsaved your life. You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here. You\nshould do the same.\u201d</b> But as he left the boy looked back over his\nshoulder, and when she saw his eyes Dany thought, The Harpy has another Son. -\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWe are all dead,\nthen. You gave us death, not freedom.\u201d <b>Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face.</b></i></p><p><i>Strong Belwas seized\nhim by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard\nGhael\u2019s teeth crack. The Shavepate would have done worse, but she stopped him.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cEnough,\u201d\nshe said, dabbing at her cheek with the end of her tokar. \u201cNo one has ever\ndied from spittle. Take him away.\u201d </i></b><i>- Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>With all of that, I think Dany actually\ndid a very good job to keep the peace. She is conciliatory, courteous, seeks\npeaceful solutions, while also trying to gain small victories for the freedmen.\nShe usually tries to find a middle ground. While I do think the peace was a\nmistake, I think this period in Dany\u2019s story was important for her to learn.</p><ul><li><b>Morality</b><br></li></ul><p>Dany\nis a very kind person who strives to do good, but there are also moments in\nwhich she gets angered over the injustice that she witnesses. Dany didn\u2019t grow\nup with anyone to teach her about honor and justice, only Viserys. So this\nmeans that she sometimes makes mistakes and takes cruel actions.</p><p>The\nfirst we see is, of course, the crucifixions of 163 slave masters in punishment\nfor crucifying children. I see many people say that Dany doesn\u2019t care about\njustice, and that this action proves it, because she supposedly crucified\npeople without caring about guilt and innocence. But I wouldn\u2019t say this is\nexactly true. First, because Dany does not crucify random people. She asks for\nthe leaders of Meereen (Meereen is ruled by a council of masters), the ones most likely to be responsible for the children\u2019s\ndeaths.</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI\nwant your\u00a0leaders,\u201d Dany told them. \u201cGive them up, and the rest of you\nshall be spared.\u201d</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s\ntrue that this is still an eye for an eye, and it\u2019s still a cruel punishment.\nBut Dany does start to feel bad for the action, even if she still believes it\nto be justice:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany remembered the horror she had felt when she had seen\nthe Plaza of Punishment in Astapor. <b>I\nmade a horror just as great, but surely they deserved it. Harsh justice is\nstill justice.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>But\nlater in the books, Dany shows herself to care about innocence and guilt:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYou are fighting shadows when you should be fighting\nthe men who cast them,\u201d Daario went on. \u201cKill them all and take their\ntreasures, I say. Whisper the command, and your Daario will make you a pile of\ntheir heads taller than this\u00a0pyramid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf I knew who they were\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cZhak and Pahl and\nMerreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>He\nis as bold as he is bloody. \u201cWe have no proof this is their work. Would\nyou have me slaughter my own subjects?\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThis we have heard. And yet <b>Your Radiance has found the courage to answer butchery with mercy. You\nhave not harmed any of the noble children you hold as hostage.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThese\nmurders are not their doing,\u201d Dany told the Green Grace, feebly. \u201cI\nam no butcher queen.\u201d</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Another\ncontroversial action that Dany takes is the torture of the wineseller\ndaughters. This is obviously wrong, but I need to point out that torture is\nconsidered a valid method of interrogation in this world. The Night\u2019s Watch\ndoes it, Jon considers throwing Janos Slynt in an ice cell to force him to\ncomply and later puts Cregan Karstark in those cells, Jaehaerys tortures people\nto find out who murdered Rego Draz, the High Sparrow does it, the Arryns have a\ntorturer and the sky cells that serve as psychological torture\u2026 I could go on,\nbut I think I\u2019ve made my point. Dany is a product of her society, so she\u2019s not\nacting any differently from other rulers. There was circumstancial evidence\nagainst the wineseller and his daughters. But we can see that Dany does care\nabout innocence:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt will be done, Your Worship. Would you have me\nquestion them sweetly, or sharply?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSweetly, to begin. Hear what\ntales they tell and what names they give you. It may be they had no part in\nthis.\u201d</i></b><i> She hesitated. \u201cNine, the\nnoble Reznak said. Who else?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nchanges her stance when she gets angered about the cruel death of Rylonna Rhee,\nand orders them to be questioned sharply. But later, Dany does learn from her\nmistakes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIf there is a Harpy.\u201d Skahaz was convinced that somewhere\nin Meereen the Sons of the Harpy had a highborn overlord, a secret general\ncommanding an army of shadows. Dany did not share his belief.\u00a0<b>The Brazen Beasts had taken dozens of the\nHarpy\u2019s Sons, and those who had survived their capture had yielded names when\nquestioned sharply \u2026 too many names, it seemed to her.</b>\u00a0It would have\nbeen pleasant to think that all the deaths were the work of a single enemy who\nmight be caught and killed, but Dany suspected that the truth was otherwise. My\nenemies are legion. \u201cHizdahr zo Loraq is a persuasive man with many friends.\nAnd he is wealthy. Perhaps he has bought this peace for us with gold, or\nconvinced the other highborn that our marriage is in their best interests.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf he is not the Harpy, he knows him. I can find the truth\nof that easy enough.\u00a0<b>Give me your\nleave to put Hizdahr to the question, and I will bring you a confession.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not trust\nthese confessions. You\u2019ve brought me too many of them, all of them worthless.\u201d</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>\u201cYour Radiance\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo, I said.\u201d</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nrealizes that torture is ineffective, and forbids it. Dany is the only ruler in\nthe books to explicitly forbid torture.</p><p>I\nthink what all of this shows is that Dany is trying very hard to be just. She\ndidn\u2019t grow up with a good moral example, but she strives to be better, while\nalso trying to rule. And she is willing to change her ways and learn from her\nmistakes.</p><ul><li><b>Practical aspects of ruling</b><br></li></ul><p>Aside\nfrom trying to keep peace and bring justice, Dany also has to deal with the\ntedious aspects of ruling in Meereen. Dany is a very hands on ruler, and she\ndoesn\u2019t like to delegate too much:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cYour Grace takes too much on\nherself. You should allow your\u00a0councillors\u00a0to shoulder more of your\nburdens.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI have too many councillors\nand too few cushions.\u201d</i></b><i> Dany turned to Reznak. \u201cHow\nmany more?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>While\nmaybe Dany does take too much on herself, this also means that she gets\npractice in the several aspects of the administration of a city. One of them is\nhow to get the money that she needs:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany was shocked.\u00a0<b>\u201cThey want to be slaves?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThe ones who come are\nwell spoken and gently born, sweet queen. Such slaves are prized. In the Free\nCities they will be tutors, scribes, bed slaves, even healers and priests. They\nwill sleep in soft beds, eat rich foods, and dwell in manses.\u00a0Here they\nhave lost all, and live in fear and squalor.\u201d</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>\u201cI see.\u201d\nPerhaps it was not so shocking, if these tales of Astapor were true. Dany\nthought a moment. \u201cAny man who wishes to sell himself into slavery may do\nso. Or woman.\u201d She raised a hand. \u201cBut they may not sell their\nchildren, nor a man his wife.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cIn\nAstapor the city took a tenth part of the price, each time a slave changed\nhands,\u201d</i></b><i>\nMissandei told her.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWe\u2019ll do the same,\u201d Dany\ndecided. Wars were won with gold as much as swords.\n\u201cA\u00a0tenth\u00a0part. In gold or silver coin, or ivory. Meereen has no\nneed of saffron, cloves, or zorse hides.\u201d </i></b><i>\u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>While Dany doesn\u2019t like the idea of\npeople selling themselves back into slavery, she thinks she must respect their\nchoices (without allowing them to sell other people unwillingly). But,\nfollowing Missandei\u2019s suggestion, she takes a part of the money of those\ntransactions. She turns something that she doesn\u2019t like to do (allowing people\nto sell themselves), and tries to make use of it, and she knows that \u201cwars are\nwon with gold as much as swords\u201d, meaning that Dany is not stupid and knows\nthat armies are not the only source of power. (NOTE: I don\u2019t think Dany should\nhave allowed people to sell themselves back into slavery, because this means\nthat she\u2019s allowing part of the slave trade to continue, allowing that some\npeople have the right to own others like objects. But Dany decided to take a\nmoderate approach, and what I\u2019m analysing in this section isn\u2019t what she should\nhave done overall, but how she dealt with the practical aspects of the\nadministration of her city. As an administrative measure, I think that if Dany\nwas going to let people sell themselves back into slavery, then she made a\nsmart decision by taking a part of the money). Later, we see that Dany continues\nwith this. As I already mentioned, she takes the wealth of the noble families\nthat choose to leave Meereen. She also imposes a blood tax to pay the wages of\nthe Brazen Beasts:</p><blockquote><p><i>Reznak mo Reznak gasped. <b>\u201cMagnificence, where is the coin to come from to pay wages for so\nmany men?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cFrom the pyramids. Call it a\nblood\u00a0tax. I will have a hundred pieces of gold from every pyramid for\neach freedman that the Harpy\u2019s Sons have slain.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>With this tax, Dany is trying to do\ntwo things at once: to get the money to pay for the soldiers that she needs,\nand to weaken the Meereenese noble families that conspire against her. It\ndoesn\u2019t work, because Dany is too mild with the slavers, and takes too little\nmoney from them. But this moment shows that Dany realizes that she can use\ntaxes not only to fill the city\u2019s coffers, but also to have political gains,\nlike weakening her enemies. We also see other moments in which Dany uses taxes\nto get some benefit out of a situation that she doesn\u2019t like:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYour Magnificence,\u201d whispered Reznak mo Reznak in\nher ear, <b>\u201cit is customary for the\ncity to claim one-tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after\nexpenses, as a\u00a0tax. That coin might be put to many noble uses.\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cIt might \u2026 though if we were\nto reopen the pits, we should take our tenth before expenses. I am only a young\ngirl and know little of such matters, but I dwelt with Xaro Xhoan Daxos long\nenough to learn that much.</i></b><i> Hizdahr, if you could marshal armies\nas you marshal arguments, you could conquer the world \u2026 but my answer is still\nno. For the sixth time.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis also smart enough to know that corruption might be a problem, and she takes\nmeasures to prevent it:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt shall be done as you command, glorious queen,\u201d\nsaid Daario. \u201cMy Stormcrows will collect your tenth.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>If\nthe Stormcrows saw to the collections at least half the gold would somehow go\nastray, Dany knew.</i></b><i>\nBut the Second Sons were just as bad, and the Unsullied were as unlettered as\nthey were incorruptible. <b>\u201cRecords\nmust be kept,\u201d she said. \u201cSeek among the freedmen for men who can\nread, write, and do sums.\u201d</b></i><i> - Daenerys\nVI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s also another interesting\nmoment in which Dany has to deal with the possibility that people will try to\ntake advantage of her decrees:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThree-and-twenty.\u201d Dany sighed. <b>\u201cMy dragons have developed a\nprodigious taste for mutton since we began to pay the shepherds for their\nkills. Have these claims been proven?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSome men have brought\u00a0burnt\u00a0bones.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cMen\nmake fires. Men cook mutton. Burnt bones prove nothing.</i></b><i> Brown Ben says there\nare red wolves in the hills outside the city, and jackals and wild dogs. Must\nwe pay good silver for every lamb that goes astray between Yunkai and the\nSkahazadhan?\u201d</i><i></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, Magnificence.\u201d Reznak bowed. <b>\u201cShall I send these rascals away, or\nwill you want them scourged?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>Daenerys shifted on the bench. <b>\u201cNo man should ever fear to come to me.\u201d Some claims\nwere\u00a0false, she did not doubt, but more were genuine.</b> Her dragons had\ngrown too large to be content with rats and cats and dogs. The more they eat,\nthe larger they will grow, Ser Barristan had warned her, and the larger they\ngrow, the more they\u2019ll eat. Drogon especially ranged far afield and could\neasily devour a sheep a day. <b>\u201cPay\nthem for the value of their animals,\u201d she told Reznak, \u201cbut\nhenceforth claimants must present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and\nswear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany is smart enough to see that some people\nare deceiving her, but instead of doing what Reznak suggests, Dany knows that\nif she deals with people with brutality, they will fear ever coming to her\nagain. Instead, she uses Meereen\u2019s religious beliefs to dissuade people from\nmaking false claims. There are also several moments in which Dany states that\nshe wants people to come to her with their problems, and that she doesn\u2019t want\nthem to be afraid to speak their minds or to criticize her:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Whitebeard, \u201cthe Prince of\nDragonstone was a most puissant warrior, but \u2026\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cGo on,\u201d</i></b><i> she urged. <b>\u201cYou\nmay\u00a0speak\u00a0freely\u00a0to me.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI say no, Your Grace,\u201d the old man answered at\nonce.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201c<b>Speak</b>\u00a0<b>freely</b>.\u201d\n\u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Whitebeard bowed his head. \u201cYour Grace, I did not mean\nto give offense.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOnly\u00a0lies\u00a0offend\u00a0me,\nnever honest counsel.\u201d Dany patted Arstan\u2019s spotted hand to reassure him.\n\u201cI have a dragon\u2019s temper, that\u2019s all. You must not let it frighten\nyou.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhitebeard,\u201d\nshe said, <b>\u201cI want your\u00a0counsel,\nand you should never fear to speak your mind with me \u2026 when we are alone.</b>\nBut never question me in front of strangers. Is that understood?\u201d \u2013\nDaenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>\u201cThen what do you\u00a0advise, Ser Jorah?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYou will not like it.\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\nwould hear it all the same.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys V ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany also has to run investigations\nto find out who the Sons of the Harpy are, and has to find ways to protect her\npeople and her soldiers from them. In the end, she doesn\u2019t succeed (she only succeeds after she makes the peace deals), but Dany\ndoes take some important measures. She tries what she can to ensure the safety\nof her soldiers:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c\u2026 drawn in blood.\u201d\nDaenerys knew the way of it by now. The Sons of the Harpy did their butchery by\nnight, and over each kill they left their mark. <b>\u201cGrey Worm, why was this man alone? Had he no partner?\u201d By\nher command, when the Unsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they\nalways walked in pairs. </b>- Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>She also does what she can to\nconduct investigations:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cSend men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any\nman has come to the Blue Graces with a sword wound. And spread the word that we\nwill pay good gold for the short sword of Stalwart Shield. Inquire of the\nbutchers and the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of late.\u201d\nPerhaps some goatherd would confess. \u201cHenceforth, no man of mine walks\nalone after dark.\u201d</b> - Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Dany has to deal with a\nplague. And for her, it\u2019s a lot of trial and error to try to find a solution to\nthe pale mare situation:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Daenerys\ndare not open her gates to let them in.</i></b><i> She had tried to do what she could for them. <b>She had sent them healers</b>, Blue Graces\nand spell-singers and barber-surgeons, <b>but\nsome of those had sickened as well, and none of their arts had slowed the\ngalloping progression of the flux that had come on the pale mare. Separating\nthe healthy from the\u00a0sick\u00a0had proved impractical as well.</b> Her\nStalwart Shields had tried, pulling husbands away from wives and children from\ntheir mothers, even as the Astapori wept and kicked and pelted them with\nstones.<b> A few days later,\nthe\u00a0sick\u00a0were dead and the healthy ones were\u00a0sick. Dividing the\none from the other had accomplished nothing.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Many shat where they slept now, too\nfeeble to crawl to the ditches she\u2019d commanded them to dig.</i></b><i> Two women fought over a charred bone. Nearby a boy of ten\nstood eating a rat. He ate one-handed, the other clutching a sharpened stick\nlest anyone try to wrest away his prize. Unburied dead lay everywhere. Dany saw\none man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak, but as she rode past his\ncloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women sat upon the ground\nclutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. Those who had the strength\ncalled out. \u201cMother \u2026 please, Mother \u2026 bless you, Mother \u2026\u201d</i><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThey are too feeble,\u201d said Symon Stripeback.</i></p><p><b><i>Dany said, \u201cMore food might\nmake them\u00a0stronger.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>Symon shook his head. \u201cFood should not be wasted on the\ndying, Your Worship. We do not have enough to feed the living.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>He was not wrong, she\nknew, but that did not make the words any easier to hear.</b> \u201cThis is far\nenough,\u201d the queen decided. \u201cWe\u2019ll feed them here.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys\nVI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Dany gazed across the\ncamp, to the many-colored brick walls of Meereen. The air was thick with flies\nand cries. \u201cThe gods have sent this pestilence to humble me. <b>So many dead \u2026 I will not have them\neating\u00a0corpses.\u201d</b> She beckoned Aggo closer. \u201cRide to the\ngates and bring me Grey Worm and fifty of his Unsullied.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys VI\nADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>By the time Aggo returned with Grey Worm and fifty of the\nUnsullied loping behind his horse, Dany had shamed all of them into helping\nher. <b>Symon Stripeback and his men were\npulling the living from the dead and stacking up the corpses, while Jhogo and\nRakharo and their Dothraki helped those who could still walk toward the shore\nto\u00a0bathe\u00a0and wash their clothes.</b> Aggo stared at them as if they\nhad all gone mad, but Grey Worm knelt beside the queen and said, \u201cThis one\nwould be of help.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Before midday a dozen fires were\nburning. </i></b><i>Columns of greasy black smoke rose\nup to stain a merciless blue sky. Dany\u2019s riding clothes were stained and sooty\nas she stepped back from the pyres. <b>\u201cWorship,\u201d\nGrey Worm said, \u201cthis one and his brothers beg your leave to bathe in the\nsalt sea when our work here is done, that we might be purified according to the\nlaws of our great goddess.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Though\nthe queen had let the Astapori starve outside her walls to keep the\nbloody\u00a0flux\u00a0from spreading, it was spreading nonetheless.</i></b><i> Many had been\nstricken: freedmen, sellswords, Brazen Beasts, even Dothraki, <b>though as yet none of\nthe\u00a0Unsullied\u00a0had been touched.</b> She prayed the worst was past. \u2013\nDaenerys VII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the quotes above are very\ninteresting because we can see Dany gaining experience as she tries to control\nthe situation. She tries sending healers, but they get sick. She tries\nseparating sick and healthy, but soon sees that people don\u2019t want to be separated\nfrom their loved ones. She tries giving them more food. She digs ditches, burn\ncorpses and helps to clean people. Those things show that Dany has some idea\nthat she needs to be careful to not spread the disease (she closes the gates),\nand at the same time, she also understands that hygiene is important. I think\nthat the observation about how the Unsullied were not touched by the plague is\nsomething that, in the future, will be useful for Dany, something that she will\nremember. In conclusion, I think these moments show just how much Dany is\ntrying to learn from the situation, how she seems to be taking note of what\nworks and what doesn\u2019t. I think Dany will come out of this much more prepared\nto deal with similar situations when necessary, and I think this is important\nto her growth as a ruler as well.</p><p>In my opinion, Dany has shown\nherself to be very smart and capable of dealing with the practical aspects of\nthe administration of a city.</p><ul><li><b>Dany\u2019s equalitarian practices</b><br></li></ul><p>One thing that distinguishes Dany as\na ruler is how she gives power and voice to the smallfolk. She listens to them at court and\ncouncil, and gives them the same respect:</p><blockquote><p><i>Reznak would have summoned another tokar next, but\nDany insisted that he call upon a freedman. <b>Thereafter she\u00a0alternated\u00a0between the former masters and the\nformer slaves.</b></i> \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Rylona Rhee had played the harp as sweetly as the\nMaiden<b>. When she had been a slave in\nYunkai, she had played for every highborn family in the city. In Meereen she\nhad become a leader amongst the Yunkish freedmen, their voice in\nDany's\u00a0councils.</b></i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Late that afternoon Admiral Groleo and Ser Barristan\nreturned from their inspection of the galleys. Dany assembled\nher\u00a0council\u00a0to hear them. <b>Grey\nWorm was there for the Unsullied</b>, Skahaz mo Kandaq for the Brazen Beasts.\nIn the absence of her bloodriders, a wizened jaqqa rhan called Rommo,\nsquint-eyed and bowlegged, came to speak for her Dothraki. <b>Her freedmen were represented by the captains of the three companies\nshe had formed\u2014Mollono Yos Dob of the Stalwart Shields, Symon Stripeback of the\nFree Brothers, Marselen of the Mother\u2019s Men</b>. Reznak mo Reznak hovered at\nthe queen\u2019s elbow, and Strong Belwas stood behind her with his huge arms\ncrossed.</i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><ul><li><b>Some mistakes worth addressing</b><br></li></ul><p>One mistake that Dany makes is that\nshe takes hostages, but fails to kill them when the Sons of the Harpy attack.\nIf she wasn\u2019t going to kill her hostages, she shouldn\u2019t have taken hostages in\nthe first place. But it\u2019s important to remember that Dany understands her\nfailure in this situation:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany pushed her food\nabout her plate. She dare not glance over to where Grazhar and Qezza stood, for\nfear that she might cry. The Shavepate has a harder heart than mine. They had\nfought about the hostages half a dozen times. \u201cThe Sons of the Harpy are\nlaughing in their pyramids,\u201d Skahaz said, just this morning. \u201cWhat\ngood are hostages if you will not take their heads?\u201d <b>In his eyes, she was only a weak woman.</b> Hazzea was enough. What\ngood is peace if it must be purchased with the blood of little children?\n\u201cThese murders are not their doing,\u201d Dany told the Green Grace,\nfeebly. \u201cI am no butcher queen.\u201d - Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s\nnot like Dany doesn\u2019t know she made a mistake. She knows the Shavepate sees her\nas weak, and she knows her enemies must think this as well. So I believe that\nin the future, Dany won\u2019t take hostages unless she intends to kill them.</p><p>There\nare also moments in which Dany is too open:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cOn what\nterms?\u201d Beware the perfumed seneschal, Quaithe had said. The masked woman\nhad foretold the coming of the pale mare, was she right about the noble Reznak\ntoo? \u201cI may be a young girl innocent of war, but I am not a lamb to walk\nbleating into the harpy\u2019s den. I still have my Unsullied. I have the Stormcrows\nand the Second Sons. I have three companies of freedmen.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThem, and\ndragons,\u201d said Brown Ben Plumm, with a grin.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cIn\nthe pit, in chains,\u201d wailed Reznak mo Reznak.</i></b><i> \u201cWhat good are\ndragons that cannot be controlled? Even the Unsullied grow fearful when they\nmust open the doors to feed them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat, o\u2019 the\nqueen\u2019s little pets?\u201d Brown Ben\u2019s eyes crinkled in amusement. The grizzled\ncaptain of the Second Sons was a creature of the free companies, a mongrel with\nthe blood of a dozen different peoples flowing through his veins, but he had\nalways been fond of the dragons, and them of him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPets?\u201d\nscreeched Reznak. \u201cMonsters, rather. Monsters that feed on children. We\ncannot\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSilence,\u201d\nsaid Daenerys. \u201cWe will not speak of that.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>Reznak shrank away from\nher, flinching from the fury in her tone. \u201cForgive me, Magnificence, I did\nnot \u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>Dany sighed. <b>\u201cI am sorry, Ben. I dare not loose the\ndragons.\u201d She could see that was not the answer that he wanted.</b> -\nDaenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>In\nthis scene, we can see that Dany tries to control the information, and she\ntries to silence Reznak when he starts to speak too much. But in the end, she\nends up telling Ben that she will not use the dragons, which ends up leading to\nhim betraying her. But I think this can be seen as a slip, not a flaw in Dany\nas a ruler, because we see in several other moments that Dany is not a gullible\nperson. She distrusts Xaro and Pyat Pree in Qarth, and in Meereen, she refuses\nto tell Xaro her secrets:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIs that meant to\nfrighten me? I lived in fear for fourteen years, my lord. I woke afraid each\nmorning and went to sleep afraid each night \u2026 but my fears were burned away the\nday I came forth from the fire. Only one thing frightens me now.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cAnd\nwhat is it that you fear, sweet queen?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\nam only a foolish young girl.\u201d</i></b><i> Dany rose on her toes and kissed his cheek. <b>\u201cBut not so foolish as to tell you\nthat.</b> My men shall look at these ships. Then you shall have my\nanswer.\u201d - Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso tells Hazzea\u2019s father that he shouldn\u2019t tell anyone about what happened.\nEven in the scene in which she tells Ben that she can\u2019t use her dragons, she\ndoes try to be cautious about the information she discloses, and she can\nrecognize her mistake with Ben Brown Plumm:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNever that,\u201d said Brown Ben, \u201cbut it\u2019s not all about the\ncoin, Your High-and-Mightiness. [\u2026] Silver\u2019s sweet and gold\u2019s our mother, but\nonce you\u2019re dead they\u2019re worth less than that last shit you take as you lie\ndying. I told you once, there are old sellswords and there are bold sellswords,\nbut there are no old bold sellswords. My boys didn\u2019t care to die, that\u2019s all,\nand when I told them that you couldn\u2019t unleash them dragons against the\nYunkishmen, well \u2026\u201d</p><p><b>You saw me as defeated,\nDany thought, and who am I to say that you were wrong?</b> - Daenerys VIII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So\nI would say this was mostly a slip. Dany is not an stupid and naive person, and\nshe can see what her mistakes were.</p><p>Another\nthing that Dany fails to do is that, as Tyrion notes, is that she doesn\u2019t poison the\nwell outside Meereen, which would have helped her to defeat the siege of the\nYunkai\u2019i. We are never told the reasons for it in Dany\u2019s POV, but if I could\nguess, I imagine it\u2019s for the same reason that Dany has been so insistent on\npeace: she knows that if she poisons the wells, she would be condemning the\nAstapori refugees to death. We still don\u2019t know what Dany will do next in her\nstory, but I guess it\u2019s understandable why Dany doesn\u2019t do this, because she\u2019s\ntrying to do the right thing.</p><p>Finally,\nwe also have this moment, in which Dany and Barristan are talking about the\nBrazen Beasts:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cA mask can hide many things, Your Grace. Is the man\nbehind the owl mask the same owl who guarded you yesterday and the day before?\nHow can we know?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHow\nshould\u00a0Meereen\u00a0ever come to trust the Brazen Beasts if I do not?</i></b><i> There are good brave men beneath those masks. I put my life\ninto their hands.\u201d Dany smiled for him. \u201cYou fret too much, ser. I\nwill have you beside me, what other protection do I need?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys IX\nADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>There\nare pros and cons in each approach. The reason for the mask of the Brazen\nBeasts is for them to not be recognized, so they won\u2019t be targeted and attacked\nby the Sons of the Harpy. And from the perspective of someone that is seeking\npeace, Dany is right in saying that she can\u00b4t ask Meereen to trust the Brazen\nBeasts if she doesn\u00b4t.\nIt\u00b4s a question of appearances: she needs to show confidence if she wants her\npeople to feel safe and\ntrust the Brazen Beasts. On the other hand, Barristan is right in saying that\nmasks can make it easier for her enemies to hide (though Dany is not completely unprotected. She still keeps people she trusts by her side, like\nBarristan and Belwas, so it\u2019s not like Dany is neglectful of her own safety).\nBesides, Dany has let Hizdahr appoint a cousin to the command of the Brazen\nBeasts, which is bad for her, because this could make her lose control of one\nof her more important military forces. So there are good points to be made\nin favor of Dany\u2019s decisions here, but also good points against her decisions.</p><p>I\nthink these mistakes show that Dany isn\u2019t perfect, but in no way they mean that\nDany is a bad ruler. They mean that Dany is a human being, so sometimes she\nslips, while also trying to do what\u2019s right. And Dany does understand some of her\nmistakes. She\u2019s mindful of them, which is a positive thing.</p><p><b>IS DAENERYS A GOOD RULER? WHAT DID SHE LEARN?</b></p><p>Now\nlet\u2019s look at Dany\u2019s whole journey. In AGOT, Dany learns the importance of\nculture and traditions, she learns how to be strong and assertive, and with\nJorah Mormont, she asks for information about Westeros and the Dothraki that\nher brother never bothers to ask.</p><p>In\nACOK, Dany leads her people out of the Red Waste by giving an example of\nstrength, determination, care for her people, respect for their culture,\npragmatism and by making the sensible decision to send her bloodriders to find\na way out of the desert so they don\u2019t have to walk blindly through the desert.\nIn Qarth, she\u2019s suspicious and cautious but not paranoid, she escapes\ndeceptions and temptations, and finds a new resolve.</p><p>In\nASOS, Dany makes brilliant battle plans, but also big mistakes. But she learns\nfrom her mistakes: she understands her failure in leaving Astapor behind\nwithout an army to protect it, and she understands her failure in leaving the\nmasters of Yunkai in power.</p><p>In\nADWD, Dany does everything possible to rebuild the economy (she plants crops,\nnegotiates for trade, and make compromises to lift the siege against Meereen),\nand to keep the people of Meereen free. She deals well with taxes, and does\neverything she can to stop the plague. She trains new soldier companies to\nprotect her city, and later tries to make the sellswords change sides, because\nshe know that she must be prepared if the peace breaks. She makes compromises to\nbring peace, and acts accordingly to make the peace deals work. In my opinion,\nall of this shows that Dany was a very good ruler in Meereen. She took a very sensible\ncourse of action, probably the best she could have done in the circumstances,\nbecause she didn\u2019t have enough military power to defeat the slavers. Her\nwillingness to make compromises shows that she is the kind of ruler who seeks\npeaceful solutions. But in the end, Dany comes to reflect on the pros and cons\nof peace, and decides that the peace wasn\u2019t worth it, because it was an unjust\npeace. This is important because Dany needs to know when to look for peaceful\nsolutions, and when war is necessary. Dany will certainly come out of this as a\nmore decisive and mature ruler.</p><p>Besides,\nher actions as a queen that cares about her people are bearing fruits. Her\npeople still love her and support her even in the direst times:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany saw one man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak,\nbut as she rode past his cloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women\nsat upon the ground clutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. <b>Those who had the strength called out.\n\u201cMother \u2026 please, Mother \u2026 bless you, Mother \u2026\"\u00a0</b></i><i>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Later, when Dany is gone from the\ncity, her people are still loyal to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>When His Grace had\ntried to put them under the command of a cousin, as he had the Brazen Beasts, <b>Grey Worm had informed the king that they\nwere free men who took commands only from their\u00a0mother.</b></i>\n\u2013 The Queensguard ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\"Is it true?\u201d a freedwoman shouted. <b>\u201cIs our\u00a0mother\u00a0dead?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Reznak screeched. \u201cQueen\nDaenerys will return to Meereen in her own time in all her might and majesty.\nUntil such time, His Worship King Hizdahr shall\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHe\nis no king of mine,\u201d a freedman yelled.</i></b>\n\u2013 The Discarded Knight ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Their loyalty to Dany is what keeps\neveryone together:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>A\u00a0young\u00a0girl\u00a0she\nmight be, but Daenerys Targaryen was the only thing that held them all\ntogether.</i></b><i>\n\u2013 The Queen\u2019s Hand ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\npeople continue fighting for Dany. Barristan deposes Hizdahr for the suspicion\nthat he was the one that tried to poison her. When Yunkai attacks in the TWOW\nchapters that were released, the Mother\u2019s Men, Free Brothers, Stalwart Shields,\nthe pit fighters and the Brazen Beasts are all there willing to fight, even\nthough Yunkai has the numerical advantage. And it\u2019s not only loyalty for Dany,\nbut also the hope that she gave them, that they can fight for their own freedom.\nThe revolution that Dany started is not just in her hands anymore, it\u2019s being\ncarried by everyone else. That\u2019s her legacy. And it\u2019s a great thing that\nDaenerys was able to accomplish that.</p><p>Dany\nis politically savvy. She is observant, capable of adapting to other cultures\nand to different situations, speaks several languages, listens to her people\nregardless of birth or social status, cares for women, sees her position of\nqueen as a duty to her people, is self critical, conciliatory, merciful (even if she does get angry and make mistakes sometimes), courteous,\nunderstands the importance of keeping up appearances and manipulating people\u2019s\nperceptions of her and of the different situations, is pragmatic, knows how to\nassess the strength of each man under her command and use them accordingly,\nalways tries to learn more and seeks for information, listens to counsel, is\nnot gullible but is not paranoid either, respects people\u2019s humanity and tries\nto make social chances that benefit the oppressed. She is good at understanding\npeople\u2019s motivations (like Hizdahr\u2019s true intentions in reopening the fighting\npits), she understands supply and demand, understands symbols of power (like\nthe tokar), understands that she can\u2019t answer people with brutality or else her\npeople will be afraid to come to her, and understands that she needs to be seen\ncaring about her people. She\nhas gained experience in managing the economy, avoiding corruption, commanding armies, diplomacy and\ncompromises. And she has gained a more mature understanding of peace and war.</p><p><a></a>Dany still has things to learn, of\ncourse. She has now decided on a fire and blood path. I do believe this is\nnecessary to end slavery and that making peace with the slavers was the wrong\nchoice. But it\u2019s also very likely that Dany will make mistakes, and at some\npoints, she might go too far with fire and blood.\u00a0\n\nShe has an even bigger internal conflict coming her way in The Winds of Winter: how far is Dany willing to go? What kind of violence is justified?\n\n But this is important for\nDany to learn. She won\u2019t become the perfect ruler in a single day. And Dany has\nan even bigger responsibility, because she owns the only dragons in the entire\nworld, and has to learn how to wield a huge power responsibly.</p><p><a></a>But regardless of what happens in future books, I do think that, given all I discussed here, Dany is a great leader and a great ruler.</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>For the longest time, I wanted to\nwrite about Dany as a leader and a ruler. Most of the time, the metas I see from\nDany haters just talk about what an awful ruler Dany is, and amongst Daenerys\nfans, this is usually not discussed a lot, mostly because I think Dany fans\nspend a lot of time defending Dany from the accusations that she is evil or\nmad, so other subjects are neglected. Before I start, I just want to make it\nclear that I am not any expert on medieval politics or war strategy, so this\nwill be mostly my understanding of the story. And of course, I can\u2019t forget to\nmention that many of the ideas of the Meereenese Blot are here as well, but\nthis is going to be my interpretation.</p><p>In this analysis, I will show why I\nthink Daenerys is an intelligent and capable leader and ruler. I want to look\nat everything we know about Dany in all of the books: her childhood and education,\nher political beliefs, her actions and the economic and political situation\nshe\u2019s in. I\u2019ll try to focus on what Dany has learned in each book, and how it\nhelped her become a better leader.</p><p>Some of the things I\u2019ll write here\nare similar to metas that I\u2019ve written before. But I want this one to be as\ncomplete as possible, and to analyze every facet of Dany\u2019s storyline as a ruler\nthat I can think of. I will bring book quotes to back up what I say, so this\nwill be <i>very</i> long (It\u2019s around 20k\nwords, so I hope at least someone will be interested in reading it, because I\nspent months scrutinizing all of the books to write this).</p><p>In this essay, I will talk about the following topics:</p><p><b>Dany\u2019s childhood and education</b></p><p><b>Dany\u2019s intelligence, wisdom and introspectiveness</b></p><p><b>Dany\u2019s changing political views</b></p><p><b>Dany journey as a leader in A Game of Thrones</b></p><p><b>Dany\u2019s journey as a leader in A Clash of Kings</b></p><p><b>Dany\u2019s journey as a leader in A Storm of Swords<br></b></p><p><b>Dany\u2019s journey as a leader in A Dance with Dragons:<br></b></p><ul><li><b>Economy</b></li><li><b>The war against Yunkai and the question of peace and war</b></li><li><b>The question of taking the wealth of the slave masters</b></li><li><b>Conflicting interests within the city</b></li><li><b>Morality</b></li><li><b>Practical aspects or ruling</b></li><li><b>Dany\u2019s equalitarian practices</b></li><li><b>Some mistakes worth addressing</b></li></ul><p><b>Is Daenerys a good ruler? What did she learn?</b></p>[[MORE]]<p><b>DANY\u2019S CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION</b><br></p><p>Dany spent her childhood poor,\nhomeless, and had to go from place to place, never stopping for too long. She\ndidn\u2019t have money or stability to have a formal education: </p><blockquote><p><i><b>After Ser Willem had died</b>, the servants had stolen what\nlittle money they had left, and soon after <b>they had been put out of the big\nhouse.</b> Dany had cried when the\u00a0red\u00a0door\u00a0closed behind them\nforever.</i></p><p><i><b>They had wandered since then</b>, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr\nto Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, <b>never staying long in any one\nplace. </b>Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper\u2019s hired knives were close\nbehind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.</i></p><p><i><b>At first the magisters\nand archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to\ntheir homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to\nsit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner.</b> Years past\nthey had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin\nthey had gotten from Mother\u2019s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of\nPentos, they called her brother \u201cthe beggar king.\u201d Dany did not want\nto know what they called her. \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Dany\nlater confirms that she indeed never had any formal education:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cTell me of this other Daenerys. <b>I know less than I\nshould of the history of my father\u2019s kingdom. I never had\na\u00a0maester\u00a0growing up.</b>\u201d Only a brother. \u2013 </i>Daenerys VIII ADWD<i></i></p></blockquote><p>But we also have this quote:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cA queen must listen to all,\u201d [\u2026] <b>She had read that in a\u00a0book.</b> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I ASOS<i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany spent her childhood poor,\nhomeless, without receiving a formal education. Most of what Dany knows comes\nfrom Viserys, from her own experience, and from a few books she has read. Given\nthat Dany and Viserys were poor, I imagine that the only times that Dany\nhad access to books were when they were guests at some archon\u2019s or prince\u2019s\nhome, and this was only in the beginning, before the doors started closing on\nthem. I think this is the first thing we need to know if we want to understand Dany\u2019s mistakes and beliefs, and not crucify her for them. Daenerys is not\nsupposed to start the story as a great leader who makes no mistakes. Her story,\nfrom the very beginning, is all about learning.</p><p><b>DANY\u2019S INTELLIGENCE, WISDOM AND INTROSPECTIVENESS</b></p><p>Despite lacking education and\nexperience, Dany shows herself to be very intelligent and wise.</p><p>Dany is observant, always aware of\nher situation, surroundings and of the people around her:</p><blockquote><p><i>Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he\u2019d never had a friend he wouldn\u2019t cheerfully sell for the right price. <b>Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things</b>, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The cobbler thanked her for that, and the old brickmaker kissed her foot, </i><b><i>but the weaver looked at her with eyes as hard as slate. She knows I lie, the queen thought.</i> </b>- Daenerys V ADWD<br></p></blockquote><p>She is not\ngullible:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy does he give\nus so much?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat does he want from us?\u201d For nigh on\nhalf a year, they had lived in the magister\u2019s house, eating his food, pampered\nby his servants. <b>Dany was thirteen, old\nenough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the\nfree city of Pentos.</b>\u00a0\u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT<i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThey are your people, and they love you well,\u201d\nMagister Illyrio said amiably. \u201cIn holdfasts all across the realm, men\nlift secret toasts to your\u00a0health\u00a0while women sew dragon banners and\nhide them against the day of your return from across the water.\u201d He gave a\nmassive shrug. \u201cOr so my agents tell me.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Dany had no agents, no way of\nknowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she\nmistrusted Illyrio\u2019s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio.</i></b><i> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\ntook the warlock\u2019s words well salted</i></b><i>, but the magnificence of the great city was not to\nbe denied. \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI do not\nunderstand her.\u201d <b>Pyat and Xaro had\nshowered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons,\ndeclaring themselves her loyal servants in all things,</b> but from Quaithe she\nhad gotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never\nseen the woman\u2019s face. <b>Remember\u00a0Mirri\u00a0Maz\nDuur, she told herself. Remember treachery. She turned to her bloodriders.\n\u201cWe will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that no one enters\nthis wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that the dragons are always\nwell guarded.</b>\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Thirteen. To be sure.\nXaro was one of the Thirteen. No doubt he had convinced each of his fellow\nmembers to give up one ship. She knew the merchant prince too well to think\nthat he would sacrifice thirteen of his own ships. <b>\u201cI must consider this. May I inspect these ships?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYou\nhave grown suspicious, Daenerys.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>Always.\n\u201cI have grown wise, Xaro.\u201d </i></b>- Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>But at the same time, Dany is not\nparanoid, and she knows that she needs to take risks to get what she wants or\nneeds:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cIt\nseems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts\neveryone. Every man I take into my service is a\u00a0risk, I understand that,\nbut how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such\u00a0risks? Am I to conquer\nWesteros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?\u201d</i></b><i> </i>\u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI am glad you\ncame to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.\u201d <b>I will not trust you, but I need you. I\nneed your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.</b> </i>- Daenerys III\nADWD</p></blockquote><p>We\ncontinue to see this attitude in all of the books, with good, bad and uncertain\nresults: Dany trusts Barristan, which was a good thing. Despite being warned by\nQuaithe\u2019s prophecies and the prophecies of the House of the Undying, Dany is\nnot paranoid about them. She is aware of the danger from Reznak (who she thinks\nis the perfumed seneschal) and Quentyn (the Sun\u2019s son), the danger from\nsellswords and people in her court, but she tries to make use of everyone even\nthough she doesn\u2019t fully trust them, trying not to be gullible but without\nbeing paranoid.</p><p>Dany\nis very adaptable and respects different cultures, which enables her to survive\ndifferent situations, while her brother fails:</p><blockquote><p><i>Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse\nrearing beneath him as he reined up too hard. \u201cYou dare!\u201d he screamed\nat her. \u201cYou give commands to me? To me?\u201d He vaulted off the horse,\nstumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet.\nHe grabbed her, shook her. \u201cHave you forgotten who you are? Look at you.\nLook at you!\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Dany did not need to look. She was\nbarefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest\ngiven her as a bride gift. She looked as though she\u00a0belonged\u00a0here.\nViserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail.</i></b><i> \u2013 </i>Daenerys III AGOT<i></i></p></blockquote><p>She\u2019s\nalso very introspective, capable of reflecting on her experiences and mistakes,\nand always tries to learn and improve. One of the things she tries to improve\nis her magical knowledge:<i></i></p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI thank you, Mirri Maz\nDuur,\u201d she said, \u201cfor the lessons you have taught me.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cYou will not hear me\u00a0scream,\u201d Mirri\nresponded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI will,\u201d Dany said, \u201cbut it is not your\nscreams I want, only your life. <b>I\nremember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.</b>\u201d \u2013 </i>Daenerys X AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And when Dany\u2019s bloodriders and Ser\nJorah tell Dany to not enter the House of The Undying, Dany tells them that the\nreason she wants to go is to obtain more knowledge:</p><blockquote><p><i>Ser Jorah Mormont gave the merchant prince a sour look.\n\u201cYour Grace, remember\u00a0Mirri\u00a0Maz Duur.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI do,\u201d Dany said, suddenly decided. \u201c<b>I remember that she had knowledge.</b> And\nshe was only a maegi.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys IV ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She tries to improve her military\nknowledge:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany reined in her mare\nand looked across the fields, to where the Yunkish host lay athwart her path. <b>Whitebeard had been teaching her how best\nto\u00a0count the numbers of a foe. \u201cFive thousand,\u201d she said after a\nmoment.</b> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nloves books, and tries to learn from them:</p><blockquote><p><i>Ser Jorah Mormont\napologized for his gift. \u201cIt is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor\nexile could afford,\u201d he said as <b>he\nlaid a small stack of old\u00a0books\u00a0before her. </b>They were histories and\nsongs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue.<b> She thanked\nhim with all her heart. </b>\u2013 Daenerys II AGOT</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cA\u00a0queen\u00a0must\u00a0listen\u00a0to\u00a0all,\u201d[\u2026]\n<b>She had read that in a book.</b>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys I ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m\ncold,\u201d Dany lied. <b>\u201cBring me\nthe\u00a0book\u00a0I was reading last night.\u201d She wanted to lose herself\nin the words, in other times and other places. </b>The fat leather-bound volume\nwas full of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms. Children\u2019s stories, if\ntruth be told; too simple and fanciful to be true history. All the heroes were\ntall and handsome, and you could tell the traitors by their shifty eyes. Yet\nshe loved them all the same. Last night she had been reading of the three\nprincesses in the red tower, locked away by the king for the crime of being\nbeautiful. \u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Dragons\u00a0are\u00a0fire\u00a0made\u00a0flesh.\nShe had read that in one of the books Ser Jorah had given her as a wedding\ngift.</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYou \u2026 you mean to ride them?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOne of them. <b>All\nI know of dragons is what my brother told me when I was a girl, and some I read\nin\u00a0books</b>, but it is said that even Aegon the Conqueror never dared\nmount Vhagar or Meraxes, nor did his sisters ride Balerion the Black Dread.\nDragons live longer than men, some for hundreds of years, so Balerion had other\nriders after Aegon died \u2026 but no rider ever flew two dragons.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys\nVIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalways tries to listen to people, and use their advice when she lacks the\nnecessary knowledge:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cA\nqueen must listen to all,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThe highborn and the\nlow, the strong and the weak, the noble and the venal. One voice may speak you\nfalse, but in many there is always truth to be found.\u201d</i></b><i> She had read that in\na\u00a0book. \u2013 </i>Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The old man had not\nwanted to sail to Astapor; nor did he favor buying this slave army. <b>A queen should hear all sides before\nreaching a\u00a0decision</b>. That was why Dany had brought him with her to the\nPlaza of Pride, not to keep her safe. \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAggo, Jhoqo, and\nRakharo still serve me.\u201d He is playing games with me. Dany could play as\nwell. <b>\u201cI am only a young girl and\nknow little of such things, but\u00a0older,\u00a0wiser\u00a0men tell me that to\nhold Meereen I must control its hinterlands, all the land west of Lhazar as far\nsouth as the Yunkish hills.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\nhad no answer for that. If this is\u00a0truly\u00a0what\nmy\u00a0people\u00a0wish, do I have the right to deny it to them?</i></b><i> It was their city\nbefore it was mine, and it is their own lives they\u00a0wish\u00a0to squander.\n\u201cI will consider all you\u2019ve said. Thank you for your counsel.\u201d She\nrose. \u201cWe will resume on the morrow.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis also very introspective and self critical, always reflecting on her\nexperiences and mistakes, and deciding that she needs to learn how to rule:</p><blockquote><p><i>That morning she\nsummoned her captains and commanders to the garden, rather than descending to\nthe audience chamber. <b>\u201cAegon\u00a0the\nConqueror\u00a0brought fire\u00a0and\u00a0blood\u00a0to Westeros, but afterward\nhe gave them peace, prosperity, and justice. But all I\nhave\u00a0brought\u00a0to Slaver\u2019s Bay is death and ruin.

Do I have the taint?</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cA dragon,\u201d Ser Barristan said with certainty.\n\u201cMeereen is not Westeros, Your Grace.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cBut\nhow can I rule seven kingdoms if I cannot rule a single city?\u201d</i></b><i> He had no answer to\nthat. Dany turned away from them, to gaze out over the city once again. <b>\u201cMy children need time to heal and\nlearn. My dragons need time to grow and test their wings. And I need the same.\nI will not let this city go the way of Astapor. I will not let the harpy of\nYunkai chain up those I\u2019ve freed all over again.\u201d</b> She turned back to\nlook at their faces. \u201cI will not march.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat will you do\nthen, Khaleesi?\u201d asked Rakharo.</i></p><p><i>\u201cStay,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cRule.

It was my\nplace to\u00a0know.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She also knows that she needs to\nlearn more about the kingdom that she intends to rule:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\u201cTell me of this other Daenerys. I know less than I\nshould of the history of my father\u2019s kingdom.</b> I never had\na\u00a0maester\u00a0growing up.\u201d Only a brother. \u2013 </i>Daenerys VIII ADWD<i></i></p></blockquote><p>This\ngift for self-reflection is something we see constantly in ADWD as well, while\nDany ponders what\u2019s the best course of action in Meereen.</p><p>Dany\nis pragmatic. In Vaes Tolorro, her people don\u2019t want to enter the city out of\nfear, but Dany insists:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI\nfear no\u00a0ghosts. Dragons are more powerful than\u00a0ghosts.\u201d<b> And figs\nare more important.</b></i><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>We\ncan also see her pragmatism in relation to war and conquest:</p><blockquote><p><i>The thought of home disquieted her. If her sun-and-stars had\nlived, he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away\nher enemies, but his strength had left the world. Her bloodriders remained,\nsworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the ways of the\nhorselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, they did not\nrule them. <b>Dany had no wish to reduce\nKing\u2019s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts. She had supped\nenough on tears. I want to make my kingdom beautiful, to fill it with fat men\nand pretty maids and laughing children. I want my people to smile when they see\nme ride by, the way Viserys said they smiled for my father.</b></i></p><p><b><i>But before she could do that she\nmust\u00a0conquer.</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMy queen,\u201d said Arstan, \u201cthere have been no\nslaves in the Seven Kingdoms for thousands of years. The old gods and the new\nalike hold slavery to be an abomination. Evil. If you should land in Westeros\nat the head of a slave army, many good men will oppose you for no other reason\nthan that. You will do great harm to your cause, and to the honor of your\nHouse.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYet I must have some\narmy,\u201d Dany said. \u201cThe boy\u00a0Joffrey\u00a0will not give me the\nIron Throne for asking politely.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys\nII ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis politically intelligent. She very easily sees the political consequences of\nRobert\u2019s death (she doesn\u2019t have the full picture, but she very quickly\nunderstands the flaws in her reasoning when Jorah points it out):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cBefore,\nthe Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo's\u00a0khalasar, a hundred thousand made\nas one by his strength.

Famously and fabulously rich \u2026</i></p><p><b><i>And like to grow richer, if I grant\nhis petition. When Dany had closed the city's\u00a0fighting\u00a0pits, the\nvalue of\u00a0pit\u00a0shares had plummeted. Hizdahr zo Loraq had grabbed them\nup with both hands, and now owned most of the\u00a0fighting\u00a0pits\u00a0in\nMeereen.</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>A brothel. Half of her\nfreedmen were from Yunkai, where the Wise Masters had been famed for training\nbedslaves. The way of the seven sighs. <b>Brothels\nhad sprouted up like mushrooms all over Meereen. It is all they know. They need\nto survive. Food was more costly every day, whilst the price of flesh grew\ncheaper. </b>In the poorer districts between the stepped pyramids of Meereen\u2019s\nslaver nobility, there were brothels catering to every conceivable erotic\ntaste, she knew. - Daenerys I ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands supply and demand:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI\nam trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in\nthe\u00a0world.\u201c</i></b><i>\nDany smiled at him sweetly. <b>\"It\nseems to me that one-third of all the\u00a0ships\u00a0in\nthe\u00a0world\u00a0would be fair.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands the need to compromise, and that it\u2019s not enough to conquer a city,\nshe also needs to win over the people:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>To\nrule Meereen I must win the Meereenese, however much I may despise them.</i></b><i> - Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands\nthat she needs to be careful about keeping up appearances and manipulating how\nother people perceive her:</p><blockquote><p><i>That was\nDrogon's\u00a0victory, not mine, Dany wanted to say, but she held her tongue. <b>The Dothraki would esteem her all the more\nfor a few bells in her hair. </b>\u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhitebeard,\u201d\nshe said, <b>\u201cI want\nyour\u00a0counsel, and you should never fear to speak your mind with me \u2026\nwhen we are alone.

She trusted Skahaz more than she trusted Hizdahr, but <b>the Shavepate would be a disaster as a king. He was too quick to anger, too slow to forgive. </b>- Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands that she needs to be seen caring for her people:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cGo if you wish,\nser. I will not detain you. I will not detain any of you.\u201d Dany vaulted\ndown from the horse. <b>\u201cI cannot heal\nthem, but I can show them that their Mother cares.\u201d</b> - Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>But even though she has to keep up\nappearances, she tries to be just:</p><blockquote><p><i>Her name had been\u00a0Hazzea. She was four years old.\nUnless her father lied. He might have lied. No one had seen the dragon but him.\nHis proof was burned bones, but burned bones proved nothing. He might have\nkilled the little girl himself, and burned her afterward. He would not have\nbeen the first father to dispose of an unwanted girl child, the Shavepate\nclaimed. The Sons of the Harpy might have done it, and made it look like\ndragon\u2019s work to make the city hate me. Dany wanted to believe that \u2026 but if\nthat was so, why had Hazzea\u2019s father waited until the audience hall was almost\nempty to come forward? If his purpose had been to inflame the Meereenese\nagainst her, he would have told his tale when the hall was full of ears to\nhear.</i></p><p><i>The Shavepate had urged her to put the man to death.\n\u201cAt least rip out his tongue. This man\u2019s lie could destroy us all,\nMagnificence.\u201d Instead Dany chose to pay the blood price. No one could\ntell her the worth of a daughter, so she set it at one hundred times the worth\nof a lamb. <b>\u201cI would give Hazzea back to you if I could,\u201d she told the\nfather, \u201cbut some things are beyond the power of even a queen. Her bones shall be laid to rest in the\nTemple of the Graces, and a hundred candles shall burn day and night in her\nmemory. Come back to me each year upon her nameday, and your other children\nshall not want \u2026 but this tale must never pass your lips again.\u201d </b>\u2013\nDaenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This quote shows that Dany is smart\nand capable of analysing the situation to conclude that Hazzea\u2019s father was\ntelling the truth. She knows that she has to keep the tale from spreading, but\nshe also understands that it\u2019s important to be fair to her people, so she\nchooses to be kind and be just to Hazzea\u2019s father.</p><p>With all of this being said, I think\nDany has many qualities of a great ruler.</p><p><b>DANY\u2019S CHANGING POLITICAL VIEWS</b></p><p>Thanks to Dany\u2019s ability for\nself-reflection, Dany changes her political views throughout the story due to\nher experiences. She starts the story as a very na\u00efve girl who doesn\u2019t truly\nunderstands the costs of war and conquest, asking her husband to invade the\nSeven Kingdoms without really realizing what the consequences would be. First,\nshe tries to convince Drogo several times, unsuccessfully. Then, the wineseller tries to\npoison her and Drogo decides to cross the narrow sea. He attacks the Lhazareen\nto pay for the ships, and Dany finally sees the consequences of her actions:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>Slaves, Dany thought.</b>\nKhal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver\u2019s Bay. <b>She\nwanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. This is war, this\nis what it looks like, this is the price of the\u00a0Iron\u00a0Throne.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys VII AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>But\nDany is unable to ignore the horror, and two paragraphs later, she tries to put\na stop at least to the rapes, with the little power she has. She defies\nDothraki culture and Drogo\u2019s men, putting herself at risk:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Behind\u00a0them,\nthe girl being raped made a heartrending sound,</i></b><i> a long sobbing wail\nthat went on and on and on. Dany\u2019s hand clenched hard around the reins, and she\nturned the silver\u2019s head. <b>\u201cMake\u00a0them\u00a0stop,\u201d\nshe commanded Ser Jorah.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VII AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>Later, Dany reflects on what she\nthinks is acceptable in war and conquest, trying to be pragmatic but without\nunnecessary bloodshed:</p><blockquote><p><i>Blood\u00a0and fire, thought Dany. The words of House\nTargaryen. She had known them all her life. <b>\u201cThe\u00a0blood\u00a0of my enemies I will shed gladly.\nThe\u00a0blood\u00a0of\u00a0innocents\u00a0is another matter.</b> Eight\nthousand Unsullied they would offer me. Eight thousand dead babes. Eight\nthousand strangled dogs.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she\ncorrected. \u201cPrince Rhaegar led free men into battle, not slaves.\nWhitebeard said he dubbed his squires himself, and made many other knights as\nwell.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThere was no higher honor than to receive your\nknighthood from the\u00a0Prince\u00a0of\u00a0Dragonstone.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cTell me, then\u2014when he touched\na man on the shoulder with his sword, what did he say? \u2018Go forth and kill the\nweak\u2019? Or 'Go forth and defend them\u2019?</i></b><i> At the\nTrident, those brave men Viserys spoke of who died beneath our dragon\nbanners\u2014did they give their lives because they believed in Rhaegar\u2019s cause, or\nbecause they had been bought and paid for?\u201d Dany turned to Mormont,\ncrossed her arms, and waited for an answer. \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Another thing that changes are her\nviews on slavery. Dany starts as someone who lives in a slave society and has\nno strong feelings against slavery. While she was living with Illyrio, she had\nslaves serving her, and with the Dothraki, she had slave servants as well.\nBut as soon as Drogo dies, Dany frees her slaves.<i> </i>Even then, while Dany no longer has slaves herself, she has no\nstrong feelings about the slaves in Qarth, and even considers buying a slave\narmy. But when Dany sees the horrors in Astapor and understands what slavery\ntruly means, she turns away from it:</p><blockquote><p><i>Xaro\u00a0caught it in the air and took a bite. \u201cWhence\ncame this madness? Should I count myself fortunate that you did not free my\nown\u00a0slaves\u00a0when you were my guest in Qarth?\u201d</i></p><p><i>I was a beggar queen and you were Xaro of the Thirteen, Dany\nthought, and all you wanted were my dragons. <b>\u201cYour slaves seemed well treated and content. It was not till\nAstapor that my eyes were opened. Do you know how Unsullied are made and\ntrained?\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And despite being raised by Viserys,\nDany was able to think on her on view on what a king should be, and what are\nher duties as a monarch:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI was alone for a long time, Jorah. All alone but for\nmy brother. I was such a small scared thing. <b>Viserys should have protected me, but instead he hurt me and scared me\nworse. He shouldn\u2019t have done that. He wasn\u2019t just my brother, he was my king.\nWhy do the gods make kings and queens, if not to protect the ones who can\u2019t\nprotect themselves?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSome kings make\nthemselves.\u00a0Robert\u00a0did.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe was no true king,\u201d Dany said scornfully.\n\u201cHe did no justice. <b>Justice \u2026\nthat\u2019s what kings are for.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>A\u00a0queen\u00a0belongs\u00a0not\nto herself but to her people.</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys was only able to change her\nviews and become a more conscious ruler because of her self-reflection and\nempathy, and this is one of the things that sets her apart as a leader. With\nall that being said, let\u2019s see Dany\u2019s journey in each of the books.</p><p><b>FINDING HER WAY IN THE WORLD</b></p><p>The first two books are, in my\nopinion, about Daenerys finding out what she wants and what to do. It\u2019s the\nbeginning of her journey as a leader, and she\u2019s going on instinct, trying to\nfind out what to do.</p><p><b>A GAME OF THRONES</b></p><p>People usually look at this book as\nthe story of a scared little girl overcoming abuse and becoming stronger. This\nis all true, but this is also the book where Dany starts to develop her\nleadership skills. In this book, Dany learns how to be more assertive and how\nto deal with this new authority that is given to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWait here,\u201d\nDany told Ser Jorah. <b>\u201cTell them all\nto stay. Tell them I command it.\u201d</b></i><i></i></p><p><i>The knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had\na neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and\nchest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his smiles gave\nDany comfort. <b>\u201cYou are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cNot a\u00a0queen,\u201d said Dany.\n\u201cA\u00a0khaleesi.\u201d </b>She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the\nridge alone. \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>Unlike Viserys, Dany learns about\nDothraki culture and adapts to it. This allows her to gain more respect than\nher brother:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>Take</b>\u00a0<b>his</b>\u00a0<b>horse</b>,\u201d\nDany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he\nwas hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words\ncame. <b>\u201cLet my brother walk behind\nus back to the khalasar.\u201d Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride\nwas no man at all, the lowest of the low, without honor or pride. \u201cLet\neveryone see him as he is.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany understands that Dothraki\nculture strongly associates strength with the ability to ride. So she makes a\nconscious choice to show all of the khalasar what Viserys really is, showing\nherself stronger than her brother. And we start to see just how much Viserys\nignorance is detrimental to his potential ability to lead the Dothraki:</p><blockquote><p><i>(\u2026) <b>the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal\nRhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King. Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the\nnext day, and Viserys had accepted. In his stubborn ignorance, he had not even\nknown he was being mocked</b>; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women\ngiving birth, the very young and the very old. That won him yet another name:\nKhal\u00a0Rhaggat, the Cart King. Her brother had thought it was the khal\u2019s way\nof apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah not to\ntell him the truth, lest he be shamed. \u2013 </i>Daenerys\nIV AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Because Viserys refuses to learn and\nadapt to other cultures, he loses respects, while Dany gains the respect of the\nDothraki. She respects their culture and shows her strength by eating the\nstallion\u2019s horse, riding with them until the end of her pregnancy, and\nasserting herself.</p><p>This new authority that Dany gains\nalso means that Dany sees herself more and more free of her brother\u2019s\ninfluence. She gets the chance of getting a new perspective on Westeros through\nJorah, without her brother\u2019s biases:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cThe common people pray for\nrain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,\u201d</i></b><i> Ser Jorah told her. <b>\u201cIt\nis no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as\nthey are left in peace.\u201d </b>He gave a shrug. <b>\u201cThey never are.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a\npuzzle box. <b>It went against everything\nthat Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little\nwhether a true\u00a0king\u00a0or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she\nthought on Jorah\u2019s words, the more they rang of truth. </b>\u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>She talks with Jorah about if it\nwould be possible for the Dothraki to conquer Westeros, trying to gather the\ninformation that she\u2019ll need, and even starts believing that someone else could\nconquer the Seven Kingdoms (herself):</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany could not pretend\nto surprise at the disdain in his tone. </i><b><i>\u201cWhat\n\u2026 what if it were not Viserys?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf it were someone else\nwho led them? Someone stronger? Could the Dothraki\u00a0truly\u00a0conquer\u00a0the\u00a0Seven\u00a0Kingdoms?\u201d</i> </b>- Daenerys IV AGOT<b><i></i></b></p></blockquote><p>This is also the book in which Dany\nstarts dealing with the many moral dilemmas that she encounters in her story:\nshe wants to conquer the Seven Kingdoms, but once she sees that Drogo attacks\nthe Lhazareen to fund the invasion, she sees the costs of war for the first\ntime, and stands up to Drogo\u2019s men to protect the women from being raped.\nLater, after Drogo dies, Dany frees her slaves and asks people to follow her,\npromising to protect them and care for them:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYou will be my khalasar,\u201d she told them. <b>\u201cI see the faces of\u00a0slaves. I\nfree you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one shall harm you. If you\nstay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.\u201d</b> The\nblack eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. \u201cI see the children, women,\nthe wrinkled faces of the aged. I was a child yesterday. Today I am a woman.\nTomorrow I will be old. <b>To each of you I\nsay, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for\nyou.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys X AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>But it\u2019s important to note that even\nthough Dany has more power than she starts the book with, for most of the book,\nthe power is not truly hers, it comes from Drogo. Before Dany hatches her\ndragons, she has to use Drogo\u2019s name to make herself be obeyed, and has to\nresort to things like bed tricks. Even then, she is not always successful. I\nthink it\u2019s very interesting that before Dany truly has her own power, she has\nto deal with what any woman would have to deal \u2013 trying to manipulate her\nhusband to have power and get what she wants. It\u2019s only at the end of the book\nthat Dany steps up as khaleesi in her own right. Initially, Aggo, Jhogo and\nRakharo refuse to follow her because she\u2019s a woman, but Dany insists, because\nshe knows that when she steps out of the fire and shows her strength, the\nkhalasar will follow her:</p><blockquote><p><i>Wordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her khas\ncame up behind him. Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet.\n\u201cBlood of my blood,\u201d he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking\nearth. \u201cBlood of my blood,\u201d she heard Aggo echo. \u201cBlood of my\nblood,\u201d Rakharo shouted.</i></p><p><i>And after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all\nthe Dothraki, men and women and children, and <b>Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now,\ntoday and tomorrow and\u00a0forever, hers as they had never been Drogo\u2019s.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys X AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>A Game of Thrones is an essential\npart of Dany\u2019s growth as a leader. She learns that to be respected and\naccepted, she needs to integrate into the community and understand the culture\nthat she is in. She gains a new perspective on Westeros and on war, frees\nherself from Viserys\u2019 abuse, and builds the necessary strength and confidence\nto lead her people in the future.</p><p><b>A CLASH OF KINGS</b></p><p>Now, for the first time in her life,\nDany has power on her own, and people look up to her for guidance. To survive\nthe Red Waste, Dany leads by showing an example of strength:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>They\nare not strong, she told herself, so\u00a0I\u00a0must\u00a0be their\u00a0strength.</i></b><i>\u00a0<b>I\u00a0must\u00a0show no fear, no weakness,\nno doubt.</b> However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face\nthey\u00a0must\u00a0see only Drogo\u2019s queen. She felt older than her fourteen\nyears. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was done. \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nkeeps her people together by respecting their culture and traditions:</p><blockquote><p><i>Three days into the march, the first man died. A toothless\noldster with cloudy blue eyes, he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not\nrise again. An hour later he was done. Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and\ncarried his ill luck to the living. \u201cHis time was past,\u201d her handmaid\nIrri declared. \u201cNo man should live longer than his teeth.\u201d The others\nagreed. <b>Dany bid them kill the weakest\nof their dying\u00a0horses, so the dead man might go mounted into the night\nlands.</b></i></p><p><i>Two nights later, it was an infant girl who perished. Her\nmother\u2019s anguished wailing lasted all day, but there was nothing to be done. <b>The child had been too young to ride, poor\nthing. Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands; she must be born\nagain.</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She also leads them and keeps them\ntogether by showing that she cares about them. She doesn\u2019t see herself above\nher people, and because of this, she starves with them and cares for them:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\nhungered and thirsted with the rest of them.</i></b><i> The milk in her breasts dried up, her nipples\ncracked and bled, and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was\nlean and hard as a stick, yet it was her dragons she feared for.\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Doreah\u00a0took a\nfever and grew worse with every league they crossed. Her lips and hands broke\nwith blood blisters, her hair came out in clumps, and one evenfall she lacked\nthe strength to mount her horse. Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to\nher saddle, but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea, when the Lysene\ngirl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more. <b>She gave\u00a0Doreah\u00a0water from her\nown skin, cooled her brow with a damp cloth, and held her hand until she died,\nshivering. Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on.</b> \u2013 Daenerys\nI ACOK</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>She keeps them alive by being\npragmatic, like when she insists in entering the abandoned city, breaking the\ntaboo of the Dothraki against such places because they need food:</p><blockquote><p><i>Other searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees,\nhidden behind closed doors in secret gardens. Aggo showed her a courtyard\novergrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes, and Jhogo discovered a\nwell where the water was pure and cold. Yet they found bones too, the skulls of\nthe unburied dead, bleached and broken. \u201cGhosts,\u201d Irri muttered.\n\u201cTerrible ghosts. We must not stay here, Khaleesi, this is their\nplace.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI fear no ghosts. Dragons are\nmore powerful than ghosts.\u201d And\u00a0figs\u00a0are more important.</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>And she saves her people by making\nthe sensible choice of sending her bloodriders in different directions to find\na way out of the desert:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhat shall we seek, Khaleesi?\u201d asked Jhogo.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhatever there is,\u201d Dany answered. \u201cSeek for\nother\u00a0cities, living and dead. Seek for caravans and people. Seek for\nrivers and lakes and the great salt sea. Find how far this waste extends before\nus, and what lies on the other side. <b>When\nI leave this place, I do not mean to strike out blind again. I will know where\nI am bound, and how best to get there.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>All of these actions enabled her to\nkeep her khalasar together and keep their loyalty. And after many deaths and\nsuffering, they finally get to Qarth.</p><p>But when they arrive in Qarth, there\nare more challenges. Dany thinks that she\u2019ll find something in the city:</p><blockquote><p><i>The\u00a0Bleeding\u00a0Star\u00a0led\nme to Qarth for a purpose. <b>Here I will\nfind what I need, if I have the strength to take what is offered, and the\nwisdom to avoid the traps and snares.</b> If the gods mean for me to conquer,\nthey will provide, they will send me a sign, and if not \u2026 if not \u2026 \u2013\nDaenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>And this quote establishes Dany\u2019s\narc in this book very well, because this part of her story is a test for\nher as a leader, and she learns some important lessons. She has to escape\ndifferent deceptions, and Dany is careful about that. Even with all their\nflatteries, she doesn\u2019t trust Xaro and Pyat Pree, and takes precautions against\nthem:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI do not understand her.\u201d Pyat and Xaro had\nshowered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her\u00a0dragons,\ndeclaring themselves her loyal servants in all things, but from Quaithe she had\ngotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never seen\nthe woman\u2019s face. Remember Mirri Maz Duur, she told herself. <b>Remember treachery. She turned to her\nbloodriders. \u201cWe will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that\nno one enters this wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that\nthe\u00a0dragons\u00a0are always well\u00a0guarded.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt shall be done, Khaleesi,\u201d Aggo said.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWe have seen only the parts of\nQarth that\u00a0Pyat\u00a0Pree wished us to see,\u201d she went on.\n\u201cRakharo, go forth and look on the rest, and tell me what you find. Take\ngood men with you\u2014and women, to go places where men are forbidden.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cAs you say, I do, blood of my blood,\u201d said\nRakharo.</i>\n\u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Later,\nDany also escapes treachery by refusing to fall for Xaro\u2019s bad deal (he had\noffered her 30 ships for one dragon):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI\nam trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in\nthe\u00a0world.\u201c Dany smiled at him sweetly. \"It seems to me that\none-third of all the\u00a0ships\u00a0in the\u00a0world\u00a0would be\nfair.\u201d</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso sends Jorah to find out about news from Westeros and to find ships that\ncould take them:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cSer\nJorah, find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor. It has been\nhalf a year since I last heard tidings from the Seven Kingdoms. Perhaps the\ngods will have blown some good captain here from Westeros with a ship to carry\nus home.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>The knight frowned. \u201cThat would be no kindness. The\nUsurper will kill you, sure as sunrise.\u201d Mormont hooked his thumbs through\nhis swordbelt. \u201cMy\u00a0place\u00a0is here at\u00a0your\u00a0side.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cJhogo can guard me as well. <b>You have more languages than my bloodriders, and the Dothraki mistrust\nthe sea and those who sail her. Only you can serve me in this.</b> Go among the\nships and speak to the crews, learn where they are from and where they are\nbound and what manner of men command them.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>The interesting thing here is that\nDany can see the strengths in each of her men and can use them accordingly. She\nknows that Ser Jorah is the most adequate person to entrust this task to, and\nthis shows her abilities as a leader, because a leader must know the people under her command.</p><p>Dany is not only trying to escape\ndeception, but she\u2019s also trying to get help to conquer Westeros. She tries to\nbribe the Pureborn and follow Qartheen traditions, but it doesn\u2019t work. Soon,\nDany starts to realize that she won\u2019t find help to conquer Westeros as a beggar:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Yet\neven crowned, I am a\u00a0beggar\u00a0still, Dany thought.</i></b><i> I have become the most\nsplendid\u00a0beggar\u00a0in the world, but a\u00a0beggar\u00a0all the same.\nShe hated it, as her brother must have. All those years of running from city to\ncity one step ahead of the Usurper\u2019s knives, pleading for help from archons and\nprinces and magisters, buying our food with flattery. He must have known how\nthey mocked him. Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter. In the end it had\ndriven him mad. It will do the same to me if I let it. Part of her would have\nliked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro, and make the\ndead city bloom. No, that is defeat. I have something Viserys never had. I have\nthe dragons. The dragons are all the difference. \u2013 Daenerys III ACOK</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Qarth is also important for Dany\u2019s\narc as a leader because it\u2019s a place of temptation. Qarth is a city filled with\nsplendors: it\u2019s beautiful, it has magic, it\u2019s wealthy. And both Xaro and Pyat\nPree are offering them to Dany. If she stays with Pyat Pree, she will have\nsorceries and magical knowledge at her disposal. If she stays with Xaro, she\nwill be a wealthy woman for the rest of her life. But if she does that, she\nwill have to stay in Qarth forever and will never achieve her true desire, to\ngo home to Westeros. This is a moment in her arc in which Dany has to decide\nwhat she truly wants: does she want a life of luxury or does she want to pursue\na greater destiny for herself? In the end, Dany decides to leave Qarth and make\nher own path.</p><p>In this book, Dany has successfully\nled her people through the desert through strength, pragmatism and determination, and has\nescaped Qarth because of her cleverness. She has also finally decided what she\nwants for herself:</p><blockquote><p><i>Three heads has the dragon, Dany thought, wondering. <b>\u201cI shall tell my people to make ready\nto depart at once. But the ships that bring me home must bear different\nnames.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d said Arstan.\n\u201cWhat\u00a0names\u00a0would you\u00a0prefer?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cVhagar,\u201d Daenerys told\nhim. \u201cMeraxes. And Balerion. Paint the names on their hulls in golden\nletters three feet high, Arstan. I want every man who sees them to know the\ndragons are returned.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p><b>SHAPING THE WORLD</b></p><p>The\nthird and fifth book are the ones in which Dany starts to more actively shape\nthe world around her. While in the first two books, Dany is leading through her\nstrength, adaptation to culture, instinct and pragmatism, now she finally\nstarts to deal with more complex issues. She no longer leads a small khalasar \u2013\nshe has to deal with big armies and thousands of different and diverse people.\nShe\u2019s no longer just defying Dothraki tradition \u2013 she is fighting against a\ncontinent wide system of slavery. She has to deal with military strategy, food,\ntrade, diplomacy, peace and war, and this is the moment in which Dany grows the\nmost, reflects on what is means to be a ruler, and on what it means to be a revolutionary.</p><p><b>A STORM OF SWORDS</b></p><p>In\nthis book, we see both Dany\u2019s brilliance and inexperience. She has huge\nvictories, but also makes huge mistakes.</p><p>The\nbook starts with Dany going to Illyrio, until Jorah points out that going there\nwithout an army would be risky. He convinces Dany to go to Astapor to buy the\nUnsullied. There, she sees the horrors of slavery and decides to start her\nliberation of the slaves.</p><p>In\neach of the cities, Dany makes brilliant plans. In Astapor, Dany pretends that\nshe doesn\u2019t speak Valyrian, at Ser Jorah\u2019s suggestion, to get to hear what\nKraznis doesn\u2019t want her to hear. But she also sets in motion a plan that she\ncreates all on her own: she asks Jorah how Astapor is defended, and later asks\nMissandei if the things Kraznis told her were true, to get more information\nbefore she acts. Then, she uses a Qartheen dress look more wealthy, and\nsuccessfully negotiates with the slavers, managing to buy all of the Unsullied\nso that her plan can work. She refuses to let Ser Barristan undermine her,\nordering him to be taken away from her presence when he speaks out of turn.\nWhile setting her plan in motion, she dresses in Dothraki clothes and puts the\nweakest of her people inside the column, with the warriors outside, in order to\nappear more intimidating. And before she turns on the masters, she makes sure\nto tell the Unsullied that she has paid for them, and they belong to her now,\nso that they know they no longer have to be loyal to the Astapori masters. It\nwas a very risky plan, and if it failed, Dany and all of her people would have\ndied. But Dany took all the steps necessary for it to be a success.</p><p>In\nYunkai, she tells the sellswords that she wants answers to her offers on the\nnext day, gives the Second Sons wine to get them drunk, and tells the Yukish\nenvoy that they have three days to think. Then, she organizes a surprise\nattack, defeating the sellsword companies almost with no bloodshed and with\neven fewer losses on her side.</p><p>In\nMeereen, Dany doesn\u2019t have surprise on her side, since the Meereenese have come\nto expect an attack and hid behind their walls. She understands the necessity\nof facing Meereen\u2019s champion (\u201cIf I\u00a0ignore\u00a0this any longer, my own\npeople will think me\u00a0weak\u201d \u2013 Daenerys V ASOS), but carefully chooses who\nwill face this champion:</p><blockquote><p><b>Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo were brave warriors, but they were young, and too valuable to risk. They kept her khalasar together, and were her best scouts too.</b> - Daenerys V ASOS<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his city I want, not his meager manhood.\u201d She was growing angry, however. <b>If I ignore this any longer, my own people will think me weak.</b> <b>Yet who could she send? She needed Daario as much as she did her bloodriders. Without the flamboyant Tyroshi, she had no hold on the Stormcrows, </b>many of whom had been followers of Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor the Bald. - Daenerys V ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>Once again, Dany shows\nherself as a capable leader, one that understands the importance and strengths\nof each men under her command. So she ends up sending Belwas, reasoning that:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cStrong\u00a0Belwas\u00a0was\na slave here in the fighting pits. <b>If this\u00a0highborn\u00a0Oznak should fall\nto such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if he wins \u2026 well, it is a\npoor victory for one so noble</b>, one that Meereen can take no pride in.\u201d <b>And\nunlike Ser Jorah, Daario, Brown Ben, and her three bloodriders, the eunuch did\nnot lead troops, plan battles, or give her counsel. </b>He does nothing but eat and\nboast and bellow at Arstan.\u00a0<b>Belwas\u00a0was the man she could most easily\nspare. And it was time she learned what sort of protector Magister Illyrio had\nsent her.</b> </i>\u2013 Daenerys V ASOS</p></blockquote><p>She\nalso takes care of Belwas, which is good to show her people that she cares\nabout them. But this is not enough to take the city, of course. The Meereenese\nburnt all the trees, so Dany can\u2019t build siege weapons. There are heads of harpies\nabove the gates to pour boiling oil, and she doesn\u2019t have enough food to feed\nher people (and can\u2019t take it from land, since the slavers burned the trees). Her\nadvisors tell her to leave Meereen behind and go to Westeros, and let her\npeople starve on the march. But Dany refuses to leave her people to die, and\nshe refuses to unnecessarily waste the lives of the Unsullied to assault the\nwalls under attack of boiling oil. Instead, Dany shows her resourcefulness \u2013\nshe makes siege weapons out of the ships that Illyrio sent her, and sends\nsoldiers to strike the chains of the slaves in the pits so they could also help\nher take the city from within.</p><p>Dany\nproves herself to be very intelligent, showing creativeness, resourcefulness,\nunderstanding of the different people that serve her and how each can be useful\nfor her, understanding of the need to keep up appearances and manipulate\npeople\u2019s perceptions, and showing that she cares for her people. But\nintelligence alone isn\u2019t enough. This book is also the one in which we see how\nher naivety, inexperience and lack of education impacts badly on her, and leads\nher to make mistakes.</p><p>In\nAstapor, she doesn\u2019t leave any army behind to protect the city. Because of\nthat, the council that she left governing is easily overthrown by the Butcher\nKing. In Yunkai, she doesn\u2019t really conquer the city, and leaves the masters\nstill in power. Then, as soon as she leaves, the masters enslave everyone\nagain. These mistakes also have serious consequences for Dany\u2019s future reign in\nMeereen: because of them, Dany will later have to deal with Astapori refugees, a plague, and with the city of Yunkai making alliances against her and besieging her\ncity.</p><p>These\nare mistakes that show her inexperience, and lack of formal education, but they\nalso show that Dany had bad advisors: both Jorah and Barristan don\u2019t really\ncare about Dany\u2019s anti-slavery campaign. They constantly tell her that she has\nnothing to gain here, and that she should just go to Westeros. Because none of\nthem is interested in ending slavery, they don\u2019t warn Dany about the mistakes\nthat she is making: they don\u2019t advise her to leave an army in Astapor, and they\ndon\u2019t tell her what\u2019s going to happen when she leaves Yunkai. Both of them are\nmore educated and experienced than her, and yet they tell her nothing.</p><p>Another\nthing that has consequences in the future is the question of bad faith. Dany\ndoes care about being honorable and upholding certain deals:</p><blockquote><p><i>Strong Belwas drew his\narakh. \u201cStrong Belwas will give his ugly tongue to the little queen, if\nshe likes.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo,\nBelwas. I have given these men my safe conduct.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>But at the same time, Dany\u2019s battle plans in Astapor and\nYunkai both involved deceit, and she also uses her dragons to intimidate an\nenvoy. This deceit was necessary, though: Dany starts with no army, and she\u2019s\nat a disadvantage when dealing with the slavers. It was certainly the right\nthing to do, and the best she could do in her circumstances. But of course, it\nwill still have consequences in the future, during her efforts to make peace,\nbecause the slavers don\u2019t trust her:<i></i></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAh, there is the thorn in the bower, my queen,\u201d\nsaid Hizdahr zo Loraq. <b>\u201cSad to say,\nYunkai has no faith in your promises. They keep plucking the same string on the\nharp, about some envoy that your dragons set on fire.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cOnly his\u00a0tokar\u00a0was\u00a0burned,\u201d said\nDany scornfully.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cBe that as it may, they do not\ntrust you.</i></b><i> The men of New Ghis feel the same.\nWords are wind, as you yourself have so oft said. No words of yours will secure\nthis peace for Meereen. Your foes require deeds. They would see us wed, and\nthey would see me crowned as king, to rule beside you.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys\ncan\u2019t unmake her mistakes. But thankfully, she learns from them. She refuses\nto leave Meereen behind, like she did in Astapor and Yunkai. And later in the\nnext book, Dany is very mindful of what might happen to her city if she takes\nher army away, showing that she learned from her mistake in Astapor:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI know that the Mother of Dragons will not abandon us\nin our hour of peril. Lend us your Unsullied to defend our walls.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>And if I do, who\nwill\u00a0defend\u00a0my\u00a0walls?</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys\nIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Westeros.\nHome. But if she left, what would happen to her city?</i></b><i> - Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMeet the\nfoe,\u201d she echoed, \u201cwith the freedmen you\u2019ve called half-trained and\nunblooded.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe were all\nunblooded once, Your Grace. The Unsullied will help stiffen them. If I had five\nhundred knights \u2026\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOr\nfive. And if I give you the Unsullied, I will have no one but the Brazen Beasts\nto hold Meereen.\u201d</i></b><i>\nWhen Ser Barristan did not dispute her, Dany closed her eyes. Gods, she prayed,\nyou took Khal Drogo, who was my sun-and-stars. You took our valiant son before\nhe drew a breath. You have had your blood of me. Help me now, I pray you. Give\nme the wisdom to see the path ahead and the strength to do what I must to keep\nmy children safe. - Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso understands her mistakes in leaving Yunkai untaken and leaving the masters\nin power:</p><blockquote><p><i>His new Unsullied are\nan obscene jape. \u201cKing Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens and let\nthe Yunkai'i tend theirs.\u201d It was not that Dany harbored any love\nfor\u00a0Yunkai. <b>She was coming to\nregret leaving the Yellow City untaken after defeating its army in the field.\nThe Wise Masters had returned to slaving as soon as she moved on, and were busy\nraising levies, hiring sellswords, and making alliances against her.</b> \u2013\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Overall, I think this book is great\nto show us just how smart Dany is: she seeks different sources of information\nin Astapor, listens to Ser Barristan\u2019s lessons in military matters, makes\nbrilliant plans that minimize bloodshed, knows her men and how to use each of\nthem, and punishes rapists and murderers in her army after the sack of Meereen.\nBut this book also strips Dany of her initial naivety, and she realizes that\nconquering and ruling are not the same thing. She realizes that she needs\nexperience. And we see, once again, one of Dany\u2019s greatest qualities: her\nself-reflection and willingness to learn. She decides to stay, learn how to be\na ruler and take responsibility for her actions.</p><p><b>A DANCE WITH DRAGONS</b></p><p>ASOS\nis, in my opinion, the book in which Dany makes the most mistakes, leading to\nthe consequences that I already described. But I also think that we shouldn\u2019t\nlook at her mistakes in ASOS and say that this means that Dany is an awful\nruler. Because it\u2019s more than understandable why she makes these mistakes. She\nhas no education or experience. It would be unrealistic if she knew everything\nshe had to do from the start.</p><p>So\nin ADWD, Dany has to deal with the mistakes she has already made, because she\ncan\u2019t unmake them, she can\u2019t go back in time to fix them. She also has to deal\nwith a lot of situations that are completely out of her control. In my opinion,\nwhile Dany made big mistakes in Astapor and Yunkai, she dealt very well with\nthe situation in Meereen, considering her circumstances. So let\u2019s dive into it.\nMeereen\u2019s storyline is very complex, so I\u2019ll deal with different aspects of it\nin different sections.</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b><br></li></ul><p>People\ncriticize Daenerys for several things: because \u201cshe destroyed the economy\u201d,\nbecause \u201cshe should have a plan before she took the city to stop the economy\nfrom collapsing\u201d and \u201cshe didn\u2019t do anything to establish a new economy without\nslavery\u201d. So let\u2019s address these criticisms.</p><p><b>\u201cShe destroyed the\neconomy\u201d</b></p><p>Let\u2019s\nlook at everything we know about Meereen\u2019s economy:</p><p>Their\nmain export are slaves. Astapor produces soldiers, Yunkai produces bed slaves,\nand Meereen produces bedslaves, teachers and artisans.</p><p>Aside\nfrom slaves, Meereen also has olives, salt, wine and copper. In the\nhinterlands, slaves grow wheat and olives, herd sheep and goats, and mine salt\nand copper. But even though Meereen produces other things beyond slaves, they\nare not enough to sustain the economy, and Meereen\u2019s economy is based mostly on\nslavery:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Without\nslaves,\u00a0Meereen\u00a0had little to offer traders. </i></b><i>\u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>When\nDany ends slavery, this means that she no longer has slaves to sell. And the\nslavers burnt the olive trees and the best grape arbors before Dany came into\nthe city to stop her from building siege weapons. Copper is not a very valuable\nmetal and Meereen\u2019s wine is of an inferior vintage.</p><p>These\nthings aren\u2019t Dany\u2019s fault. Meereen didn\u2019t have a lot of things to trade aside\nfrom slaves, and she couldn\u2019t stop the masters from burning the olive trees and\nthe grape arbors. This means that Meereen\u2019s economy was already very poor (it was rich because of slavery, but poor in other things) before Dany even conquered the city.</p><p>And\nthere\u2019s also the fact that Dany is not the kind of person to leave her people\nbehind, so she lets the former slaves from Astapor and Yunkai come with her,\nwhich also means that she has more mouths to feed.</p><p>If\nDaenerys wants to end slavery, there\u2019s nothing she can do about the fact that\nthe economy will suffer if she no longer has slaves to sell. </p><p>There\nare also some problems that came with Dany\u2019s mistakes in Yunkai and Astapor.\nThe fact that Dany didn\u2019t take the masters out of power in Yunkai meant that,\nas soon as Dany left, they reenslaved people, and decided to attack Dany in\nMeereen, putting her city under siege. The Yunkish army surrounded her city\nfrom land, and Qartheen ships closed the bay, so she can\u2019t get trade, and\nfishers can\u2019t go into the bay. This is partly because of Dany\u2019s mistakes,\nbecause she left the masters of Yunkai in power. But as I\u2019ve said, Dany can\u2019t\ngo back in time to fix those mistakes, she can only deal with the consequences. And Dany would have to face opposition no\nmatter what she did. The powers of Essos would not simply accept Dany freeing\ntheir slaves and ruining their economy, and Dany also poses a symbolical\nthreat. So most likely, the economy of the city would suffer because of the war\nagainst the slavers, no matter what Dany did.</p><p>Ending\nslavery means disrupting the economy, there\u2019s no way around it.</p><p><b>\u201cShe should have a plan\nbefore she took the city to stop the economy from collapsing\u201d</b></p><p>I\u2019ve\nseen people suggest that Dany should have ended slavery gradually, or that she\nshould have waited to end slavery, so that she could first build a new economy,\nand only later free the slaves. But there are practical and ethical problems\nwith these suggestions.</p><p>Dany\nused the help of the slaves to take the city. While Dany was trying to take the\ncity from the outside, the slaves rose in revolt from the inside. Dany even\nsends part of her men to strike off the chains of the slaves in the fighting\npits. After taking the city with their help, Dany can\u2019t just tell the slaves\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to free you because of the economy, so you will have to wait\u201d.\nIf she did that, she would turn the slaves against her, and she would have both\nslaves and slavers trying to overthrow her. And if she did wait to free the\nslaves, she would probably have to compromise more with the slavers to be able\nto rule, and this would make it impossible for her to free the slaves later.</p><p>Besides,\n\u201cending slavery gradually\u201d is just inhumane. Take into consideration that every\nday, slaves are being raped, tortured, mutilated and overworked. If you think\nthat Daenerys should have ended slavery gradually, so that she could preserve\nthe economy and end slavery \u201cpeacefully\u201d, that only means that you care more\nabout the lives of the slavers and their livelihood than you care about the\nslaves.</p><p><b>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything\nto establish a new economy without slavery\u201d</b></p><p>Another\nbaseless accusation. Dany does a lot to rebuild Meereen\u2019s economy. She plants\nbeans, grapes, olives and wheat. She sends her khalasar to conquer the\nhinterlands and free the slaves there, and these former slaves are also\nplanting and bringing their crops to Meereen. The Green Grace had told Dany\nthat the soil of Meereen became infertile after the wars with the Valyrians, so\nshe starts to build a ditch to bring water to the plantations, showing how Dany\nis resourceful and how she is thinking in the long term, working on the\ninfrastructure of the city to make it agriculturally independent. She also\nsends Daario to Lhazar, to reopen the overland trade routes and bring grains\ninto the city. She negotiates with Xaro, hoping to trade the few things that Meereen\nhas to offer. And when the city is put under siege, Dany compromises and\nmarries Hizdahr, so that the siege can be lifted and she can have trade again.\nShe also has to deal with things like guilds of artisans, that don\u2019t want to\nallow freedmen into their business, so Dany has to demand that they open their\nrolls to the freedmen.</p><p>But\neven all of those things are not enough, because some things are simply\nimpossible. She can\u2019t make crops grow overnight and she doesn\u2019t have magical\nwagons to fly over the siege lines and deliver trade into her city. No matter\nhow good a ruler is, these things are just not possible. Rebuilding an economy\nafter ending slavery is extremely difficult and takes a long time, and GRRM\nwrote a very realistic story with Daenerys. You can\u2019t expect everything to be\nperfect after only a few months of Daenerys ruling. But her efforts here show\nthat she\u2019s a good and responsible ruler, and did everything she could to\nrebuild Meeren\u2019s economy.</p><ul><li><b>The war against Yunkai and the question of peace and war</b><br></li></ul><p>When\nDany conquers Meereen, she has seen the destruction that the war caused. Her\npeople are starving, and she has learned that she won\u2019t make things right just\nby freeing slaves and moving on from place to place. To make matters worse, she\nhas to deal with the terrorist organization The Sons of the Harpy, that are\nkilling freedmen, and even started killing her own soldiers. So it\u2019s no\nsurprise that with all of the slaughter and bloodshed, she wants peace more\nthan anything.</p><p>So\nDany starts making compromises with the slavers. These compromises involve\ndifferent things: she needs to marry Hizdahr, a powerful men who comes from one\nof the Great Master\u2019s families; she has to give indemnity in gold and gemstones to the slavers of Yunkai, as a compensation for disrupting the slave trade;\nshe has to allow slavery to return outside Meereen; she has to reopen the\nfighting pits; and she has to allow slavers from outside to bring their slaves into Meereen.</p><p>Many people accuse Dany of being\nstupid and naive for believing in Hizdahr and the peace, and not seeing that\nHizdahr is probably allied with the Sons of the Harpy. But this criticism is\nunfounded, because Dany does see that he\u2019s probably one of them:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cCan you?\u201d Dany studied his eyes. <b>\u201cWhy should the Sons of the Harpy lay\ndown their knives for you? Are you one of them?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWould you tell me if you\nwere?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>He laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d - Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany makes these compromises not\nbecause she\u2019s naive, but because at her core, she is someone who doesn\u2019t like\nwar and conflicts. But there\nare also practical reasons: after chaining her dragons, Dany doesn\u2019t have\nenough military power to defy the masters. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Dany just\nmeekly accepts anything. She insists on the freedom of the people in Meereen,\nshe insists in certain rules for the fighting pits (like not allowing children,\nslaves, and not allowing thieves and debtors to be forced to fight), she\ndemands that the guilds of Meereen allow freedmen, and she trains her own\nsoldier companies, because she wants to be prepared to defend her city:</p><blockquote><p><i>He\u00a0was\u00a0wrong\u00a0in\nthat, she hoped. The freedmen had been a rabble once, but <b>she had organized the men of fighting age into companies and commanded\nGrey Worm to make them into soldiers.</b> \u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso has Ser Barristan training some boys to be knights.</p><p>With\nthese actions, Dany achieves a shaky peace with Yunkai, and she gets the Sons\nof the Harpy to stop attacking. She prepares her city in the case of a war. She\nalso manages to make her conditions on who fights in the pits, and to make\nchanges in the laws of Meereen, like in the case of the guilds. I think it\u2019s\nimportant to acknowledge that Dany\u2019s course of action in Meereen was a sensible\none, and she did achieve some small victories.</p><p>But\nthis plot isn\u2019t just about seeing just how much Dany can accomplish as a ruler.\nIt\u2019s also meant for her to reflect and learn about what peace and war mean. She\nstarts the books as someone who was appalled by the costs of war, and tries\neverything she can to get peace. But as time goes, she realizes that her\nmerciful path has also caused problems. One example is when she reflects about\ncertain mistakes that she made, like leaving the slave masters in power:</p><blockquote><p><i>She had not forgotten\nthe slave children the\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters\u00a0had nailed up along the\nroad from\u00a0Yunkai. They had numbered one hundred sixty-three, a child every\nmile, nailed to mileposts with one arm outstretched to point her way. After\nMeereen had fallen, Dany had nailed up a like number\nof\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters. Swarms of flies had attended their slow dying, and\nthe stench had lingered long in the plaza. <b>Yet\nsome days she feared that she had not gone far enough. These Meereenese were a\nsly and stubborn people who resisted her at every turn. They had freed their\nslaves, yes \u2026 only to hire them back as servants at wages so meagre that most\ncould scarce afford to eat.</b> Those too old or young to be of use had been\ncast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled. And still\nthe\u00a0Great\u00a0Masters\u00a0gathered atop their lofty pyramids to complain\nof how the dragon queen had filled their noble city with hordes of unwashed\nbeggars, thieves, and whores. \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nstarts to question the costs of peace as well:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThere may be another choice. <b>The Yunkai'i can be persuaded to allow all your freedmen to remain\nfree, I believe, if Your Worship will agree that the Yellow City may trade and\ntrain slaves unmolested from this day forth. No more blood need flow.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSave\u00a0for the blood of\nthose slaves that the Yunkai'i will trade and train,\u201d</i></b><i> Dany said, but she recognized the truth in his words even\nso. It may be that is the best end we can hope for. \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHis Grace is\ndreaming, but <b>I cannot sleep. On the\nmorrow I must bathe in\u00a0blood. The price of peace.</b>\u201d \u2013 Daenerys\nVIII</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The Brazen Beasts did as they were bid. Dany watched them at\ntheir work. <b>\u201cThose bearers were\nslaves before I came. I made them free. Yet that palanquin is no lighter.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cTrue,\u201d said Hizdahr, \u201cbut those men\nare\u00a0paid\u00a0to\u00a0bear\u00a0its weight now.

A Brazen Beast in a boar mask had offered the\nlitter bearer a skin of water. <b>\u201cI\nsuppose I must be thankful for small victories,\u201d</b> the queen said. \u2013\nDaenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>They\nstamped their feet and slapped their bellies and shouted, \u201cMhysa, Mhysa,\nMhysa,\u201d </i></b><i>until\nthe whole pit seemed to tremble. Dany let the sound wash over her. <b>I am not\u00a0your\u00a0mother, she might\nhave shouted, back, I am the\u00a0mother\u00a0of\u00a0your\u00a0slaves, of\nevery boy who ever died upon these sands whilst you gorged on honeyed locusts.</b>\n\u2013 Daenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso realizes that this peace isn\u2019t truly sustainable, because she\u2019s in the\nhands of the slavers:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany scarce touched a bite. <b>This is peace, she told herself. This is what I wanted, what I worked\nfor, this is why I married Hizdahr. So why does it taste so much like defeat?</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is only for a little while more, my love,\u201d\nHizdahr had assured her. \u201cThe Yunkai'i will soon be gone, and their allies\nand hirelings with them.

Set\nPretty\u00a0Meris\u00a0free. At once.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nstarts to see that peace is not ideal like she had thought. And she starts to\nreflect if this peace is really worth it, and comes to the conclusion that it\nisn\u2019t:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cOne will die, or the other will,\u201d said Dany.\n\u201cAnd the one who lives will die some other day. <b>This was a\u00a0mistake.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cStrong Belwas ate too many locusts.\u201d There was a\nqueasy look on Belwas\u2019s broad brown face. \u201cStrong Belwas needs milk.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Hizdahr ignored the\neunuch. \u201cMagnificence, the people of Meereen have come to celebrate our\nunion. You heard them cheering you. Do not cast away their love.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cIt\nwas my floppy ears they cheered, not me. Take me from this abbatoir,\nhusband.\u201d</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This\nis as much about Dany reclaiming her identity as it is about her changing her\npolitical views. A peace that means that she has to give indemnity to slavers,\nwatch people fight to death, and let slavery continue is no true peace, because\nthousands and thousands of people will continue suffering the violence of\nslavery. And Dany doesn\u2019t want to be the kind of ruler that stands by while\ninjustice happens. So by the end of ADWD, she finally accepts fire and blood,\nwhich is necessary if she wants to end slavery once and for all.</p><p>I\nthink these reflections are necessary for Dany\u2019s learning. She needs\nto know when compromises are worth or not. She needs to learn how to be more\ndecisive to achieve the goals she has of social change. She needs to learn when\nto seek peace, and when to use Fire and Blood.</p><ul><li><b>The question of taking the wealth of the slave masters</b><br></li></ul><p>I\u2019ve\nseen many people in the fandom saying that Dany should have taken the wealth of\nthe slavers. I agree with that. If Dany had taken their wealth, they would no\nlonger be able to finance an opposition against her. She could redistribute\ntheir wealth to the former slaves, helping to minimize inequality, and she\ncould have used it to buy sellswords to fight for her. This way, she wouldn\u2019t\nhave to compromise as much as she did. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think this\nwould solve all of her problems. Because, as I said, the economy was mostly\nbased on slavery. It would still take time to rebuild the economy and base it\non something else. It would take time for Meereen to become agriculturally\nindependent and for Meereen to start producing new products for trade.</p><p>And\nit\u2019s understandable why Dany doesn\u2019t do this. First, because she has no\nexperience, and she needs to learn. It would make no sense to write a story\nabout Dany learning if she already knows everything she has to do from the\nstart. Also, because, as pointed out in the previous sections, Dany is trying\nto be moderate and conciliatory. And as someone who is highborn, Dany doesn\u2019t\nreally believe in the idea of depriving the nobility of what they possess, even\nif she\u2019s siding with the oppressed. Taking the nobility\u2019s wealth is something\nthat is very against everything Dany has been taught her entire life. So at the\nbeginning of the story, Dany doesn\u2019t want to be too radical. But that doesn\u2019t\nmean she\u2019s not smart and doesn\u2019t think about it. This is actually something\nthat Dany herself does, even though she doesn\u2019t do it enough:</p><blockquote><p><i>That brought a smile to the Shavepate\u2019s face. \u201cIt will\nbe done,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Your Radiance should know that the Great\nMasters of Zhak and Merreq are making preparations to quit their pyramids and\nleave the city.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Daenerys was sick unto death of Zhak and Merreq; she was\nsick of all the Mereenese, great and small alike. <b>\u201cLet them go, but see that they take no more than the clothes upon\ntheir backs. Make certain that all their\u00a0gold\u00a0remains here with us.\nTheir stores of food as well.\u201d </b>\u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\nlater, Daario too suggests it to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYou are fighting shadows when you should be fighting\nthe men who cast them,\u201d Daario went on. <b>\u201cKill them all and take their treasures, I say.</b> Whisper the\ncommand, and your Daario will make you a pile of their heads taller than\nthis\u00a0pyramid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf I knew who they were\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cZhak and Pahl and\nMerreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He is as bold as he is\nbloody. \u201cWe have no proof this is their work. Would you have me slaughter\nmy own subjects?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis reluctant. She\u2019s smart enough to realize that she needs to take the wealth of the masters, but she\u2019s not\nwilling to go too far (and she\u2019s even less willing to accept Daario\u2019s violent idea). But if the ending of ADWD is any indication, Dany has changed her stance, and won\u2019t be indecisive anymore.</p><ul><li><b>Conflicting interests within the city</b><br></li></ul><p>Even\nthough I think the compromises and the peace were a mistake, I think it\u2019s\npointless to look at what Dany should have done. We need to look at what she\ndecided to do. Dany decided to strive for peace, so I think that we should look\nat how she worked to achieve that.</p><p>At the start of Dany\u2019s reign, slaves\nand slavers want different things, and there are many problems that arose with\nthe sack: the slavers want punishment for the crimes during the sack, and the\nslaves want the masters punished for their past crimes against them. In face of\nthis, Dany chooses conciliation, pardoning the crimes during the sack and the\ncrimes the slavers committed before she took the city, not only out of\nclemency, but also out of pragmatism:</p><blockquote><p><i>A former slave came, to\naccuse a certain noble of the Zhak. The man had recently taken to wife a\nfreedwoman who had been the noble\u2019s bedwarmer before the\u00a0city\u00a0fell.\nThe noble had taken her maidenhood, used her for his pleasure, and gotten her with\nchild. Her new husband wanted the noble gelded for the crime of rape, and he\nwanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble\u2019s bastard as\nhis own. Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding. <b>\u201cWhen he lay with her, your wife was his property, to do with as\nhe would. By law, there was no rape.\u201d Her decision did not please him, she\ncould see, but if she gelded every man who ever forced a bedslave, she would\nsoon rule a\u00a0city\u00a0of\u00a0eunuchs.</b></i><b><i></i></b></p><p><i>A boy came, younger than Dany, slight and scarred, dressed\nup in a frayed grey tokar trailing silver fringe. His voice broke when he told\nof how two of his father\u2019s household slaves had risen up the night the gate\nbroke. One had slain his father, the other his elder brother. Both had raped\nhis mother before killing her as well. The boy had escaped with no more than\nthe scar upon his face, but one of the murderers was still living in his\nfather\u2019s house, and the other had joined the queen\u2019s soldiers as one of the\nMother\u2019s Men. He wanted them both hanged.</i></p><p><b><i>I am queen over a city built on dust\nand death.</i></b><i> <b>Dany had no choice but to deny him. She had declared\na\u00a0blanket\u00a0pardon\u00a0for all crimes committed during the sack. Nor\nwould she punish slaves for rising up against their masters.</b> \u2013 </i>Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>After the sack of Meereen, Dany had\npunished rapists and murderers amongst her own soldiers:</p><blockquote><p><b>She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists their manhood. </b>Eight killers swung from the walls, and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms, but Meereen was calm again. - Daenerys VI ASOS<br></p></blockquote><p>But in Meereen, she\ncan\u2019t control what the slaves do while rising against their masters, and\npunishing crimes committed during the sack would be impractical and give rise\nto lots of conflicts and anger from the former slaves against her. Similarly,\npunishing the former masters would be impractical as well. This decision shows\nDany\u2019s pragmatism, and it was important for keeping some semblance of peace in\nMeereen.</p><p>She also rules that a rich woman\nthat lost her house cannot have it back, but that she can have back her jewels\nand clothes. I\u2019ve seen many people criticize Dany for it, but the intention was\nclear and consistent with Dany\u2019s intentions in Meereen. Dany tries to be conciliatory,\ngranting the woman her clothes and jewels, but denying her the house, because\nthe alternative would mean that the former slaves occupying the house would be\nhomeless.</p><p>Another instance in which we can see\nDany being conciliatory is how she treats the problem of the guilds of artisans\nin Meereen:</p><blockquote><p><i>Her sleepless night soon made itself felt. Before long she\nwas fighting off a yawn as Reznak prattled about the craftsmen's\u00a0guilds.\nThe stonemasons were wroth with her, it seemed. The bricklayers as well. Certain\nformer slaves were carving stone and laying bricks, stealing work\nfrom\u00a0guild\u00a0journeymen and masters alike. \u201cThe freedmen work too\ncheaply, Magnificence,\u201d Reznak said. \u201cSome call themselves\njourneymen, or even masters, titles that belong by rights only to the craftsmen\nof the\u00a0guilds. The masons and the bricklayers do respectfully petition\nYour Worship to uphold their ancient rights and customs.\u201d<b></b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThe freedmen work cheaply\nbecause they are hungry,\u201d Dany pointed out. \u201cIf I forbid them to\ncarve stone or lay bricks, the chandlers, the weavers, and the goldsmiths will\nsoon be at my gates asking that they be excluded from those trades as\nwell.\u201d She considered a moment. \u201cLet it be written that henceforth\nonly guild members shall be permitted to name themselves journeymen or masters\n\u2026 provided the guilds open their rolls to any freedman who can demonstrate the\nrequisite skills.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany manages to partially pacify the\nguild members, saying that only them could name themselves journeymen or masters, while also keeping the freedmen in their trades and demanding\nthat they have a place in the guilds.</p><p>To keep the peace, Dany also adapts\nto Meereenese culture and traditions. She speaks their language:</p><blockquote><p><i>A small, damp man, he smelled as if he had bathed in perfume\nand <b>spoke a bastard form of High\nValyrian, much corrupted and flavored with a thick Ghiscari growl.</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYou are kind to say so,\u201d\nDany answered, in the same\u00a0tongue.</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys\nI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She wears the tokar, even though she\nunderstands what the garment symbolizes:</p><blockquote><p><i>Even wound properly, the\u00a0tokar required its wearer to\nhold it in place with the left hand. Walking in a\u00a0tokar\u00a0demanded\nsmall, mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy\ntrailing fringes. <b>It was not a garment\nmeant for any man who had to work. The\u00a0tokar\u00a0was a master\u2019s garment,\na sign of wealth and power.</b></i></p><p><b><i>Dany had wanted to ban the tokar\nwhen she took Meereen, but her advisors had convinced her otherwise. </i></b><i>\u201cThe Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever\nhated,\u201d warned the Green Grace, Galazza Galare. \u201cIn the wools of\nWesteros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall forever remain a\nstranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conqueror. Meereen\u2019s\nqueen must be a lady of Old Ghis.\u201d Brown Ben Plumm, the captain of the\nSecond Sons, had put it more succinctly. <b>\u201cMan\nwants to be the king o\u2019 the rabbits, he best wear a pair o\u2019 floppy ears.\u201d </b>\u2013\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This shows that Dany understands\nboth pros and cons of wearing the tokar. She understands that the garment is a\nsymbol of power. But as someone who\u2019s seeking peace, Dany chooses to wear it to\nbe conciliatory.</p><p>Another thing that she does is\nfollow the Meereenese marriage rites and religion, but with one exception:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMagnificence, you\ndo not understand,\u201d protested Reznak. <b>\u201cThe\u00a0washing\u00a0of\nthe\u00a0feet\u00a0is hallowed by tradition. It signifies that you shall be\nyour husband\u2019s handmaid.</b> The wedding garb is fraught with meaning too. The\nbride is dressed in dark red veils above a tokar of white silk, fringed with\nbaby pearls.\u201d</i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>A bride price paid in\nblood. Daenerys was weary of fighting this battle. Even Ser Barristan did not\nthink she could win. \u201cNo ruler can make a people good,\u201d Selmy had\ntold her. \u201cBaelor the Blessed prayed and fasted and built the Seven as\nsplendid a temple as any gods could wish for, yet he could not put an end to\nwar and want.\u201d A queen must listen to her people, Dany reminded herself.\n\u201cAfter the wedding Hizdahr will be king. Let him reopen the fighting pits\nif he wishes. I want no part of it.\u201d Let the blood be on his hands, not\nmine. She rose. \u201c<b>If my husband\nwishes me to\u00a0wash\u00a0his\u00a0feet, he must first\u00a0wash\u00a0mine.</b>\nI will tell him so this evening.\u201d She wondered how her betrothed would\ntake that. \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany understands that for the peace,\nshe must follow Meereenese traditions. But she also understands that as a woman\nin power, she can\u2019t afford to be seen as weak, so she can\u2019t be seen as \u201cher\nhusband\u2019s handmaid\u201d. Once again, Dany tries a conciliatory solution.</p><p>Courtesy is also important in\nkeeping the peace, and Dany does her best to be courteous even when she doesn\u2019t\nlike something:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the afternoon a\nsculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the\nPlaza of Purification with one cast in Dany\u2019s image. <b>She denied him with as much courtesy as she could muster.</b> A pike of\nunprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished\nto give it to the queen. <b>She admired the\nfish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, and sent the\npike to her kitchens.</b> A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished\nrings to wear to war. <b>She accepted it\nwith fulsome\u00a0thanks;</b> it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished\ncopper would flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she\nwould sooner be clad in steel. Even a young girl who knew nothing of the ways\nof war knew that. \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYour Grace need only ask him. The noble Hizdahr awaits below. Send down to him if that is your pleasure.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>You presume too much, priestess, the queen thought, but she swallowed her anger and made herself smile.</i></b><i> \u201cWhy not?\u201d She sent for Ser Barristan and told the old knight to bring Hizdahr to her. <b>\u201cIt is a long climb. Have the Unsullied help him up.\u201d </b>\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>He will be safer as a\nhostage. <b>My captain was not made\nfor\u00a0peace. Dany could not risk his cutting down Brown Ben Plumm, making\nmock of Hizdahr before the court, provoking the Yunkai'i, or otherwise\nupsetting the agreement that she had given up so much to win.</b> Daario was\nwar and woe. Henceforth, she must keep him out of her bed, out of her heart,\nand out of her. If he did not betray her, he would master her. She did not know\nwhich of those she feared the most. \u2013 VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nisn\u2019t always perfect. When dealing with Quentyn, she laughs at his story but\nforgets to explain the reason for her laugh in his language. But even though\nshe slips, Dany still makes an effort to be courteous with him:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cEnough,\u201d\nDaenerys said. \u201cPrince Quentyn has crossed half the world to offer me his\ngift, I will not have him treated with discourtesy.\u201d</i></b><i> She turned to the Dornishmen.\n\u201cWould that you had come a year ago. I am pledged to wed the noble Hizdahr\nzo Loraq.\u201d - Daenerys VII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\nlater, because of Dany\u2019s courtesy and kindness, he comes to like her and\nrespect her:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Daenerys\u00a0never\u00a0laughed.\nThe rest of Meereen might see him as an amusing curiosity,</i></b><i> like the exiled Summer Islander King\nRobert used to keep at King\u2019s Landing, <b>but\nthe queen had always spoken to him gently.</b> \u2013 The Spurned Suitor ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>All\nof this shows that Dany is good enough at her courtesies, even if she sometimes\nslips.</p><p>Finally,\nDany is not petty and does not treat people with brutality, even when they\noffend her, and that\u2019s very important, because she needs to avoid being hated\n(some people will hate her regardless of what she does, because she goes\nagainst their interests, but it\u2019s important that Dany shows herself to be a\nmerciful queen):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>When\nshe told him, the boy rushed at her,</i></b><i> but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went\nsprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The\nhuge brown eunuch yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a\nrat. <b>\u201cEnough, Belwas,\u201d Dany called.\n\u201cRelease him.\u201d To the boy she said, \u201cTreasure that tokar, for it\nsaved your life. You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here. You\nshould do the same.\u201d</b> But as he left the boy looked back over his\nshoulder, and when she saw his eyes Dany thought, The Harpy has another Son. -\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWe are all dead,\nthen. You gave us death, not freedom.\u201d <b>Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face.</b></i></p><p><i>Strong Belwas seized\nhim by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard\nGhael\u2019s teeth crack. The Shavepate would have done worse, but she stopped him.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cEnough,\u201d\nshe said, dabbing at her cheek with the end of her tokar. \u201cNo one has ever\ndied from spittle. Take him away.\u201d </i></b><i>- Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>With all of that, I think Dany actually\ndid a very good job to keep the peace. She is conciliatory, courteous, seeks\npeaceful solutions, while also trying to gain small victories for the freedmen.\nShe usually tries to find a middle ground. While I do think the peace was a\nmistake, I think this period in Dany\u2019s story was important for her to learn.</p><ul><li><b>Morality</b><br></li></ul><p>Dany\nis a very kind person who strives to do good, but there are also moments in\nwhich she gets angered over the injustice that she witnesses. Dany didn\u2019t grow\nup with anyone to teach her about honor and justice, only Viserys. So this\nmeans that she sometimes makes mistakes and takes cruel actions.</p><p>The\nfirst we see is, of course, the crucifixions of 163 slave masters in punishment\nfor crucifying children. I see many people say that Dany doesn\u2019t care about\njustice, and that this action proves it, because she supposedly crucified\npeople without caring about guilt and innocence. But I wouldn\u2019t say this is\nexactly true. First, because Dany does not crucify random people. She asks for\nthe leaders of Meereen (Meereen is ruled by a council of masters), the ones most likely to be responsible for the children\u2019s\ndeaths.</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI\nwant your\u00a0leaders,\u201d Dany told them. \u201cGive them up, and the rest of you\nshall be spared.\u201d</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s\ntrue that this is still an eye for an eye, and it\u2019s still a cruel punishment.\nBut Dany does start to feel bad for the action, even if she still believes it\nto be justice:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany remembered the horror she had felt when she had seen\nthe Plaza of Punishment in Astapor. <b>I\nmade a horror just as great, but surely they deserved it. Harsh justice is\nstill justice.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>But\nlater in the books, Dany shows herself to care about innocence and guilt:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYou are fighting shadows when you should be fighting\nthe men who cast them,\u201d Daario went on. \u201cKill them all and take their\ntreasures, I say. Whisper the command, and your Daario will make you a pile of\ntheir heads taller than this\u00a0pyramid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf I knew who they were\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cZhak and Pahl and\nMerreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>He\nis as bold as he is bloody. \u201cWe have no proof this is their work. Would\nyou have me slaughter my own subjects?\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThis we have heard. And yet <b>Your Radiance has found the courage to answer butchery with mercy. You\nhave not harmed any of the noble children you hold as hostage.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThese\nmurders are not their doing,\u201d Dany told the Green Grace, feebly. \u201cI\nam no butcher queen.\u201d</i></b><i>\n\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Another\ncontroversial action that Dany takes is the torture of the wineseller\ndaughters. This is obviously wrong, but I need to point out that torture is\nconsidered a valid method of interrogation in this world. The Night\u2019s Watch\ndoes it, Jon considers throwing Janos Slynt in an ice cell to force him to\ncomply and later puts Cregan Karstark in those cells, Jaehaerys tortures people\nto find out who murdered Rego Draz, the High Sparrow does it, the Arryns have a\ntorturer and the sky cells that serve as psychological torture\u2026 I could go on,\nbut I think I\u2019ve made my point. Dany is a product of her society, so she\u2019s not\nacting any differently from other rulers. There was circumstancial evidence\nagainst the wineseller and his daughters. But we can see that Dany does care\nabout innocence:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt will be done, Your Worship. Would you have me\nquestion them sweetly, or sharply?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSweetly, to begin. Hear what\ntales they tell and what names they give you. It may be they had no part in\nthis.\u201d</i></b><i> She hesitated. \u201cNine, the\nnoble Reznak said. Who else?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nchanges her stance when she gets angered about the cruel death of Rylonna Rhee,\nand orders them to be questioned sharply. But later, Dany does learn from her\nmistakes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIf there is a Harpy.\u201d Skahaz was convinced that somewhere\nin Meereen the Sons of the Harpy had a highborn overlord, a secret general\ncommanding an army of shadows. Dany did not share his belief.\u00a0<b>The Brazen Beasts had taken dozens of the\nHarpy\u2019s Sons, and those who had survived their capture had yielded names when\nquestioned sharply \u2026 too many names, it seemed to her.</b>\u00a0It would have\nbeen pleasant to think that all the deaths were the work of a single enemy who\nmight be caught and killed, but Dany suspected that the truth was otherwise. My\nenemies are legion. \u201cHizdahr zo Loraq is a persuasive man with many friends.\nAnd he is wealthy. Perhaps he has bought this peace for us with gold, or\nconvinced the other highborn that our marriage is in their best interests.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf he is not the Harpy, he knows him. I can find the truth\nof that easy enough.\u00a0<b>Give me your\nleave to put Hizdahr to the question, and I will bring you a confession.</b>\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not trust\nthese confessions. You\u2019ve brought me too many of them, all of them worthless.\u201d</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>\u201cYour Radiance\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo, I said.\u201d</i></b><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nrealizes that torture is ineffective, and forbids it. Dany is the only ruler in\nthe books to explicitly forbid torture.</p><p>I\nthink what all of this shows is that Dany is trying very hard to be just. She\ndidn\u2019t grow up with a good moral example, but she strives to be better, while\nalso trying to rule. And she is willing to change her ways and learn from her\nmistakes.</p><ul><li><b>Practical aspects of ruling</b><br></li></ul><p>Aside\nfrom trying to keep peace and bring justice, Dany also has to deal with the\ntedious aspects of ruling in Meereen. Dany is a very hands on ruler, and she\ndoesn\u2019t like to delegate too much:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cYour Grace takes too much on\nherself. You should allow your\u00a0councillors\u00a0to shoulder more of your\nburdens.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI have too many councillors\nand too few cushions.\u201d</i></b><i> Dany turned to Reznak. \u201cHow\nmany more?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>While\nmaybe Dany does take too much on herself, this also means that she gets\npractice in the several aspects of the administration of a city. One of them is\nhow to get the money that she needs:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany was shocked.\u00a0<b>\u201cThey want to be slaves?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThe ones who come are\nwell spoken and gently born, sweet queen. Such slaves are prized. In the Free\nCities they will be tutors, scribes, bed slaves, even healers and priests. They\nwill sleep in soft beds, eat rich foods, and dwell in manses.\u00a0Here they\nhave lost all, and live in fear and squalor.\u201d</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>\u201cI see.\u201d\nPerhaps it was not so shocking, if these tales of Astapor were true. Dany\nthought a moment. \u201cAny man who wishes to sell himself into slavery may do\nso. Or woman.\u201d She raised a hand. \u201cBut they may not sell their\nchildren, nor a man his wife.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cIn\nAstapor the city took a tenth part of the price, each time a slave changed\nhands,\u201d</i></b><i>\nMissandei told her.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWe\u2019ll do the same,\u201d Dany\ndecided. Wars were won with gold as much as swords.\n\u201cA\u00a0tenth\u00a0part. In gold or silver coin, or ivory. Meereen has no\nneed of saffron, cloves, or zorse hides.\u201d </i></b><i>\u2013 Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>While Dany doesn\u2019t like the idea of\npeople selling themselves back into slavery, she thinks she must respect their\nchoices (without allowing them to sell other people unwillingly). But,\nfollowing Missandei\u2019s suggestion, she takes a part of the money of those\ntransactions. She turns something that she doesn\u2019t like to do (allowing people\nto sell themselves), and tries to make use of it, and she knows that \u201cwars are\nwon with gold as much as swords\u201d, meaning that Dany is not stupid and knows\nthat armies are not the only source of power. (NOTE: I don\u2019t think Dany should\nhave allowed people to sell themselves back into slavery, because this means\nthat she\u2019s allowing part of the slave trade to continue, allowing that some\npeople have the right to own others like objects. But Dany decided to take a\nmoderate approach, and what I\u2019m analysing in this section isn\u2019t what she should\nhave done overall, but how she dealt with the practical aspects of the\nadministration of her city. As an administrative measure, I think that if Dany\nwas going to let people sell themselves back into slavery, then she made a\nsmart decision by taking a part of the money). Later, we see that Dany continues\nwith this. As I already mentioned, she takes the wealth of the noble families\nthat choose to leave Meereen. She also imposes a blood tax to pay the wages of\nthe Brazen Beasts:</p><blockquote><p><i>Reznak mo Reznak gasped. <b>\u201cMagnificence, where is the coin to come from to pay wages for so\nmany men?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cFrom the pyramids. Call it a\nblood\u00a0tax. I will have a hundred pieces of gold from every pyramid for\neach freedman that the Harpy\u2019s Sons have slain.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>With this tax, Dany is trying to do\ntwo things at once: to get the money to pay for the soldiers that she needs,\nand to weaken the Meereenese noble families that conspire against her. It\ndoesn\u2019t work, because Dany is too mild with the slavers, and takes too little\nmoney from them. But this moment shows that Dany realizes that she can use\ntaxes not only to fill the city\u2019s coffers, but also to have political gains,\nlike weakening her enemies. We also see other moments in which Dany uses taxes\nto get some benefit out of a situation that she doesn\u2019t like:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYour Magnificence,\u201d whispered Reznak mo Reznak in\nher ear, <b>\u201cit is customary for the\ncity to claim one-tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after\nexpenses, as a\u00a0tax. That coin might be put to many noble uses.\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cIt might \u2026 though if we were\nto reopen the pits, we should take our tenth before expenses. I am only a young\ngirl and know little of such matters, but I dwelt with Xaro Xhoan Daxos long\nenough to learn that much.</i></b><i> Hizdahr, if you could marshal armies\nas you marshal arguments, you could conquer the world \u2026 but my answer is still\nno. For the sixth time.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis also smart enough to know that corruption might be a problem, and she takes\nmeasures to prevent it:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt shall be done as you command, glorious queen,\u201d\nsaid Daario. \u201cMy Stormcrows will collect your tenth.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>If\nthe Stormcrows saw to the collections at least half the gold would somehow go\nastray, Dany knew.</i></b><i>\nBut the Second Sons were just as bad, and the Unsullied were as unlettered as\nthey were incorruptible. <b>\u201cRecords\nmust be kept,\u201d she said. \u201cSeek among the freedmen for men who can\nread, write, and do sums.\u201d</b></i><i> - Daenerys\nVI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s also another interesting\nmoment in which Dany has to deal with the possibility that people will try to\ntake advantage of her decrees:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThree-and-twenty.\u201d Dany sighed. <b>\u201cMy dragons have developed a\nprodigious taste for mutton since we began to pay the shepherds for their\nkills. Have these claims been proven?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSome men have brought\u00a0burnt\u00a0bones.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cMen\nmake fires. Men cook mutton. Burnt bones prove nothing.</i></b><i> Brown Ben says there\nare red wolves in the hills outside the city, and jackals and wild dogs. Must\nwe pay good silver for every lamb that goes astray between Yunkai and the\nSkahazadhan?\u201d</i><i></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, Magnificence.\u201d Reznak bowed. <b>\u201cShall I send these rascals away, or\nwill you want them scourged?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>Daenerys shifted on the bench. <b>\u201cNo man should ever fear to come to me.\u201d Some claims\nwere\u00a0false, she did not doubt, but more were genuine.</b> Her dragons had\ngrown too large to be content with rats and cats and dogs. The more they eat,\nthe larger they will grow, Ser Barristan had warned her, and the larger they\ngrow, the more they\u2019ll eat. Drogon especially ranged far afield and could\neasily devour a sheep a day. <b>\u201cPay\nthem for the value of their animals,\u201d she told Reznak, \u201cbut\nhenceforth claimants must present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and\nswear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany is smart enough to see that some people\nare deceiving her, but instead of doing what Reznak suggests, Dany knows that\nif she deals with people with brutality, they will fear ever coming to her\nagain. Instead, she uses Meereen\u2019s religious beliefs to dissuade people from\nmaking false claims. There are also several moments in which Dany states that\nshe wants people to come to her with their problems, and that she doesn\u2019t want\nthem to be afraid to speak their minds or to criticize her:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said Whitebeard, \u201cthe Prince of\nDragonstone was a most puissant warrior, but \u2026\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cGo on,\u201d</i></b><i> she urged. <b>\u201cYou\nmay\u00a0speak\u00a0freely\u00a0to me.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys I ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI say no, Your Grace,\u201d the old man answered at\nonce.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201c<b>Speak</b>\u00a0<b>freely</b>.\u201d\n\u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Whitebeard bowed his head. \u201cYour Grace, I did not mean\nto give offense.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOnly\u00a0lies\u00a0offend\u00a0me,\nnever honest counsel.\u201d Dany patted Arstan\u2019s spotted hand to reassure him.\n\u201cI have a dragon\u2019s temper, that\u2019s all. You must not let it frighten\nyou.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhitebeard,\u201d\nshe said, <b>\u201cI want your\u00a0counsel,\nand you should never fear to speak your mind with me \u2026 when we are alone.</b>\nBut never question me in front of strangers. Is that understood?\u201d \u2013\nDaenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>\u201cThen what do you\u00a0advise, Ser Jorah?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYou will not like it.\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\nwould hear it all the same.\u201d</i></b><i> \u2013 Daenerys V ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany also has to run investigations\nto find out who the Sons of the Harpy are, and has to find ways to protect her\npeople and her soldiers from them. In the end, she doesn\u2019t succeed (she only succeeds after she makes the peace deals), but Dany\ndoes take some important measures. She tries what she can to ensure the safety\nof her soldiers:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c\u2026 drawn in blood.\u201d\nDaenerys knew the way of it by now. The Sons of the Harpy did their butchery by\nnight, and over each kill they left their mark. <b>\u201cGrey Worm, why was this man alone? Had he no partner?\u201d By\nher command, when the Unsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they\nalways walked in pairs. </b>- Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>She also does what she can to\nconduct investigations:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cSend men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any\nman has come to the Blue Graces with a sword wound. And spread the word that we\nwill pay good gold for the short sword of Stalwart Shield. Inquire of the\nbutchers and the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of late.\u201d\nPerhaps some goatherd would confess. \u201cHenceforth, no man of mine walks\nalone after dark.\u201d</b> - Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Dany has to deal with a\nplague. And for her, it\u2019s a lot of trial and error to try to find a solution to\nthe pale mare situation:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Daenerys\ndare not open her gates to let them in.</i></b><i> She had tried to do what she could for them. <b>She had sent them healers</b>, Blue Graces\nand spell-singers and barber-surgeons, <b>but\nsome of those had sickened as well, and none of their arts had slowed the\ngalloping progression of the flux that had come on the pale mare. Separating\nthe healthy from the\u00a0sick\u00a0had proved impractical as well.</b> Her\nStalwart Shields had tried, pulling husbands away from wives and children from\ntheir mothers, even as the Astapori wept and kicked and pelted them with\nstones.<b> A few days later,\nthe\u00a0sick\u00a0were dead and the healthy ones were\u00a0sick. Dividing the\none from the other had accomplished nothing.</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Many shat where they slept now, too\nfeeble to crawl to the ditches she\u2019d commanded them to dig.</i></b><i> Two women fought over a charred bone. Nearby a boy of ten\nstood eating a rat. He ate one-handed, the other clutching a sharpened stick\nlest anyone try to wrest away his prize. Unburied dead lay everywhere. Dany saw\none man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak, but as she rode past his\ncloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women sat upon the ground\nclutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. Those who had the strength\ncalled out. \u201cMother \u2026 please, Mother \u2026 bless you, Mother \u2026\u201d</i><i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThey are too feeble,\u201d said Symon Stripeback.</i></p><p><b><i>Dany said, \u201cMore food might\nmake them\u00a0stronger.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>Symon shook his head. \u201cFood should not be wasted on the\ndying, Your Worship. We do not have enough to feed the living.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>He was not wrong, she\nknew, but that did not make the words any easier to hear.</b> \u201cThis is far\nenough,\u201d the queen decided. \u201cWe\u2019ll feed them here.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys\nVI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Dany gazed across the\ncamp, to the many-colored brick walls of Meereen. The air was thick with flies\nand cries. \u201cThe gods have sent this pestilence to humble me. <b>So many dead \u2026 I will not have them\neating\u00a0corpses.\u201d</b> She beckoned Aggo closer. \u201cRide to the\ngates and bring me Grey Worm and fifty of his Unsullied.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys VI\nADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>By the time Aggo returned with Grey Worm and fifty of the\nUnsullied loping behind his horse, Dany had shamed all of them into helping\nher. <b>Symon Stripeback and his men were\npulling the living from the dead and stacking up the corpses, while Jhogo and\nRakharo and their Dothraki helped those who could still walk toward the shore\nto\u00a0bathe\u00a0and wash their clothes.</b> Aggo stared at them as if they\nhad all gone mad, but Grey Worm knelt beside the queen and said, \u201cThis one\nwould be of help.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Before midday a dozen fires were\nburning. </i></b><i>Columns of greasy black smoke rose\nup to stain a merciless blue sky. Dany\u2019s riding clothes were stained and sooty\nas she stepped back from the pyres. <b>\u201cWorship,\u201d\nGrey Worm said, \u201cthis one and his brothers beg your leave to bathe in the\nsalt sea when our work here is done, that we might be purified according to the\nlaws of our great goddess.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Though\nthe queen had let the Astapori starve outside her walls to keep the\nbloody\u00a0flux\u00a0from spreading, it was spreading nonetheless.</i></b><i> Many had been\nstricken: freedmen, sellswords, Brazen Beasts, even Dothraki, <b>though as yet none of\nthe\u00a0Unsullied\u00a0had been touched.</b> She prayed the worst was past. \u2013\nDaenerys VII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the quotes above are very\ninteresting because we can see Dany gaining experience as she tries to control\nthe situation. She tries sending healers, but they get sick. She tries\nseparating sick and healthy, but soon sees that people don\u2019t want to be separated\nfrom their loved ones. She tries giving them more food. She digs ditches, burn\ncorpses and helps to clean people. Those things show that Dany has some idea\nthat she needs to be careful to not spread the disease (she closes the gates),\nand at the same time, she also understands that hygiene is important. I think\nthat the observation about how the Unsullied were not touched by the plague is\nsomething that, in the future, will be useful for Dany, something that she will\nremember. In conclusion, I think these moments show just how much Dany is\ntrying to learn from the situation, how she seems to be taking note of what\nworks and what doesn\u2019t. I think Dany will come out of this much more prepared\nto deal with similar situations when necessary, and I think this is important\nto her growth as a ruler as well.</p><p>In my opinion, Dany has shown\nherself to be very smart and capable of dealing with the practical aspects of\nthe administration of a city.</p><ul><li><b>Dany\u2019s equalitarian practices</b><br></li></ul><p>One thing that distinguishes Dany as\na ruler is how she gives power and voice to the smallfolk. She listens to them at court and\ncouncil, and gives them the same respect:</p><blockquote><p><i>Reznak would have summoned another tokar next, but\nDany insisted that he call upon a freedman. <b>Thereafter she\u00a0alternated\u00a0between the former masters and the\nformer slaves.</b></i> \u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Rylona Rhee had played the harp as sweetly as the\nMaiden<b>. When she had been a slave in\nYunkai, she had played for every highborn family in the city. In Meereen she\nhad become a leader amongst the Yunkish freedmen, their voice in\nDany's\u00a0councils.</b></i> \u2013 Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Late that afternoon Admiral Groleo and Ser Barristan\nreturned from their inspection of the galleys. Dany assembled\nher\u00a0council\u00a0to hear them. <b>Grey\nWorm was there for the Unsullied</b>, Skahaz mo Kandaq for the Brazen Beasts.\nIn the absence of her bloodriders, a wizened jaqqa rhan called Rommo,\nsquint-eyed and bowlegged, came to speak for her Dothraki. <b>Her freedmen were represented by the captains of the three companies\nshe had formed\u2014Mollono Yos Dob of the Stalwart Shields, Symon Stripeback of the\nFree Brothers, Marselen of the Mother\u2019s Men</b>. Reznak mo Reznak hovered at\nthe queen\u2019s elbow, and Strong Belwas stood behind her with his huge arms\ncrossed.</i>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><ul><li><b>Some mistakes worth addressing</b><br></li></ul><p>One mistake that Dany makes is that\nshe takes hostages, but fails to kill them when the Sons of the Harpy attack.\nIf she wasn\u2019t going to kill her hostages, she shouldn\u2019t have taken hostages in\nthe first place. But it\u2019s important to remember that Dany understands her\nfailure in this situation:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany pushed her food\nabout her plate. She dare not glance over to where Grazhar and Qezza stood, for\nfear that she might cry. The Shavepate has a harder heart than mine. They had\nfought about the hostages half a dozen times. \u201cThe Sons of the Harpy are\nlaughing in their pyramids,\u201d Skahaz said, just this morning. \u201cWhat\ngood are hostages if you will not take their heads?\u201d <b>In his eyes, she was only a weak woman.</b> Hazzea was enough. What\ngood is peace if it must be purchased with the blood of little children?\n\u201cThese murders are not their doing,\u201d Dany told the Green Grace,\nfeebly. \u201cI am no butcher queen.\u201d - Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s\nnot like Dany doesn\u2019t know she made a mistake. She knows the Shavepate sees her\nas weak, and she knows her enemies must think this as well. So I believe that\nin the future, Dany won\u2019t take hostages unless she intends to kill them.</p><p>There\nare also moments in which Dany is too open:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cOn what\nterms?\u201d Beware the perfumed seneschal, Quaithe had said. The masked woman\nhad foretold the coming of the pale mare, was she right about the noble Reznak\ntoo? \u201cI may be a young girl innocent of war, but I am not a lamb to walk\nbleating into the harpy\u2019s den. I still have my Unsullied. I have the Stormcrows\nand the Second Sons. I have three companies of freedmen.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThem, and\ndragons,\u201d said Brown Ben Plumm, with a grin.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cIn\nthe pit, in chains,\u201d wailed Reznak mo Reznak.</i></b><i> \u201cWhat good are\ndragons that cannot be controlled? Even the Unsullied grow fearful when they\nmust open the doors to feed them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat, o\u2019 the\nqueen\u2019s little pets?\u201d Brown Ben\u2019s eyes crinkled in amusement. The grizzled\ncaptain of the Second Sons was a creature of the free companies, a mongrel with\nthe blood of a dozen different peoples flowing through his veins, but he had\nalways been fond of the dragons, and them of him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPets?\u201d\nscreeched Reznak. \u201cMonsters, rather. Monsters that feed on children. We\ncannot\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSilence,\u201d\nsaid Daenerys. \u201cWe will not speak of that.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>Reznak shrank away from\nher, flinching from the fury in her tone. \u201cForgive me, Magnificence, I did\nnot \u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>Dany sighed. <b>\u201cI am sorry, Ben. I dare not loose the\ndragons.\u201d She could see that was not the answer that he wanted.</b> -\nDaenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>In\nthis scene, we can see that Dany tries to control the information, and she\ntries to silence Reznak when he starts to speak too much. But in the end, she\nends up telling Ben that she will not use the dragons, which ends up leading to\nhim betraying her. But I think this can be seen as a slip, not a flaw in Dany\nas a ruler, because we see in several other moments that Dany is not a gullible\nperson. She distrusts Xaro and Pyat Pree in Qarth, and in Meereen, she refuses\nto tell Xaro her secrets:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIs that meant to\nfrighten me? I lived in fear for fourteen years, my lord. I woke afraid each\nmorning and went to sleep afraid each night \u2026 but my fears were burned away the\nday I came forth from the fire. Only one thing frightens me now.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cAnd\nwhat is it that you fear, sweet queen?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\nam only a foolish young girl.\u201d</i></b><i> Dany rose on her toes and kissed his cheek. <b>\u201cBut not so foolish as to tell you\nthat.</b> My men shall look at these ships. Then you shall have my\nanswer.\u201d - Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso tells Hazzea\u2019s father that he shouldn\u2019t tell anyone about what happened.\nEven in the scene in which she tells Ben that she can\u2019t use her dragons, she\ndoes try to be cautious about the information she discloses, and she can\nrecognize her mistake with Ben Brown Plumm:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNever that,\u201d said Brown Ben, \u201cbut it\u2019s not all about the\ncoin, Your High-and-Mightiness. [\u2026] Silver\u2019s sweet and gold\u2019s our mother, but\nonce you\u2019re dead they\u2019re worth less than that last shit you take as you lie\ndying. I told you once, there are old sellswords and there are bold sellswords,\nbut there are no old bold sellswords. My boys didn\u2019t care to die, that\u2019s all,\nand when I told them that you couldn\u2019t unleash them dragons against the\nYunkishmen, well \u2026\u201d</p><p><b>You saw me as defeated,\nDany thought, and who am I to say that you were wrong?</b> - Daenerys VIII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So\nI would say this was mostly a slip. Dany is not an stupid and naive person, and\nshe can see what her mistakes were.</p><p>Another\nthing that Dany fails to do is that, as Tyrion notes, is that she doesn\u2019t poison the\nwell outside Meereen, which would have helped her to defeat the siege of the\nYunkai\u2019i. We are never told the reasons for it in Dany\u2019s POV, but if I could\nguess, I imagine it\u2019s for the same reason that Dany has been so insistent on\npeace: she knows that if she poisons the wells, she would be condemning the\nAstapori refugees to death. We still don\u2019t know what Dany will do next in her\nstory, but I guess it\u2019s understandable why Dany doesn\u2019t do this, because she\u2019s\ntrying to do the right thing.</p><p>Finally,\nwe also have this moment, in which Dany and Barristan are talking about the\nBrazen Beasts:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cA mask can hide many things, Your Grace. Is the man\nbehind the owl mask the same owl who guarded you yesterday and the day before?\nHow can we know?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHow\nshould\u00a0Meereen\u00a0ever come to trust the Brazen Beasts if I do not?</i></b><i> There are good brave men beneath those masks. I put my life\ninto their hands.\u201d Dany smiled for him. \u201cYou fret too much, ser. I\nwill have you beside me, what other protection do I need?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys IX\nADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>There\nare pros and cons in each approach. The reason for the mask of the Brazen\nBeasts is for them to not be recognized, so they won\u2019t be targeted and attacked\nby the Sons of the Harpy. And from the perspective of someone that is seeking\npeace, Dany is right in saying that she can\u00b4t ask Meereen to trust the Brazen\nBeasts if she doesn\u00b4t.\nIt\u00b4s a question of appearances: she needs to show confidence if she wants her\npeople to feel safe and\ntrust the Brazen Beasts. On the other hand, Barristan is right in saying that\nmasks can make it easier for her enemies to hide (though Dany is not completely unprotected. She still keeps people she trusts by her side, like\nBarristan and Belwas, so it\u2019s not like Dany is neglectful of her own safety).\nBesides, Dany has let Hizdahr appoint a cousin to the command of the Brazen\nBeasts, which is bad for her, because this could make her lose control of one\nof her more important military forces. So there are good points to be made\nin favor of Dany\u2019s decisions here, but also good points against her decisions.</p><p>I\nthink these mistakes show that Dany isn\u2019t perfect, but in no way they mean that\nDany is a bad ruler. They mean that Dany is a human being, so sometimes she\nslips, while also trying to do what\u2019s right. And Dany does understand some of her\nmistakes. She\u2019s mindful of them, which is a positive thing.</p><p><b>IS DAENERYS A GOOD RULER? WHAT DID SHE LEARN?</b></p><p>Now\nlet\u2019s look at Dany\u2019s whole journey. In AGOT, Dany learns the importance of\nculture and traditions, she learns how to be strong and assertive, and with\nJorah Mormont, she asks for information about Westeros and the Dothraki that\nher brother never bothers to ask.</p><p>In\nACOK, Dany leads her people out of the Red Waste by giving an example of\nstrength, determination, care for her people, respect for their culture,\npragmatism and by making the sensible decision to send her bloodriders to find\na way out of the desert so they don\u2019t have to walk blindly through the desert.\nIn Qarth, she\u2019s suspicious and cautious but not paranoid, she escapes\ndeceptions and temptations, and finds a new resolve.</p><p>In\nASOS, Dany makes brilliant battle plans, but also big mistakes. But she learns\nfrom her mistakes: she understands her failure in leaving Astapor behind\nwithout an army to protect it, and she understands her failure in leaving the\nmasters of Yunkai in power.</p><p>In\nADWD, Dany does everything possible to rebuild the economy (she plants crops,\nnegotiates for trade, and make compromises to lift the siege against Meereen),\nand to keep the people of Meereen free. She deals well with taxes, and does\neverything she can to stop the plague. She trains new soldier companies to\nprotect her city, and later tries to make the sellswords change sides, because\nshe know that she must be prepared if the peace breaks. She makes compromises to\nbring peace, and acts accordingly to make the peace deals work. In my opinion,\nall of this shows that Dany was a very good ruler in Meereen. She took a very sensible\ncourse of action, probably the best she could have done in the circumstances,\nbecause she didn\u2019t have enough military power to defeat the slavers. Her\nwillingness to make compromises shows that she is the kind of ruler who seeks\npeaceful solutions. But in the end, Dany comes to reflect on the pros and cons\nof peace, and decides that the peace wasn\u2019t worth it, because it was an unjust\npeace. This is important because Dany needs to know when to look for peaceful\nsolutions, and when war is necessary. Dany will certainly come out of this as a\nmore decisive and mature ruler.</p><p>Besides,\nher actions as a queen that cares about her people are bearing fruits. Her\npeople still love her and support her even in the direst times:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany saw one man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak,\nbut as she rode past his cloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women\nsat upon the ground clutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. <b>Those who had the strength called out.\n\u201cMother \u2026 please, Mother \u2026 bless you, Mother \u2026\"\u00a0</b></i><i>\u00a0\u2013\nDaenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Later, when Dany is gone from the\ncity, her people are still loyal to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>When His Grace had\ntried to put them under the command of a cousin, as he had the Brazen Beasts, <b>Grey Worm had informed the king that they\nwere free men who took commands only from their\u00a0mother.</b></i>\n\u2013 The Queensguard ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\"Is it true?\u201d a freedwoman shouted. <b>\u201cIs our\u00a0mother\u00a0dead?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Reznak screeched. \u201cQueen\nDaenerys will return to Meereen in her own time in all her might and majesty.\nUntil such time, His Worship King Hizdahr shall\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHe\nis no king of mine,\u201d a freedman yelled.</i></b>\n\u2013 The Discarded Knight ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Their loyalty to Dany is what keeps\neveryone together:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>A\u00a0young\u00a0girl\u00a0she\nmight be, but Daenerys Targaryen was the only thing that held them all\ntogether.</i></b><i>\n\u2013 The Queen\u2019s Hand ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\npeople continue fighting for Dany. Barristan deposes Hizdahr for the suspicion\nthat he was the one that tried to poison her. When Yunkai attacks in the TWOW\nchapters that were released, the Mother\u2019s Men, Free Brothers, Stalwart Shields,\nthe pit fighters and the Brazen Beasts are all there willing to fight, even\nthough Yunkai has the numerical advantage. And it\u2019s not only loyalty for Dany,\nbut also the hope that she gave them, that they can fight for their own freedom.\nThe revolution that Dany started is not just in her hands anymore, it\u2019s being\ncarried by everyone else. That\u2019s her legacy. And it\u2019s a great thing that\nDaenerys was able to accomplish that.</p><p>Dany\nis politically savvy. She is observant, capable of adapting to other cultures\nand to different situations, speaks several languages, listens to her people\nregardless of birth or social status, cares for women, sees her position of\nqueen as a duty to her people, is self critical, conciliatory, merciful (even if she does get angry and make mistakes sometimes), courteous,\nunderstands the importance of keeping up appearances and manipulating people\u2019s\nperceptions of her and of the different situations, is pragmatic, knows how to\nassess the strength of each man under her command and use them accordingly,\nalways tries to learn more and seeks for information, listens to counsel, is\nnot gullible but is not paranoid either, respects people\u2019s humanity and tries\nto make social chances that benefit the oppressed. She is good at understanding\npeople\u2019s motivations (like Hizdahr\u2019s true intentions in reopening the fighting\npits), she understands supply and demand, understands symbols of power (like\nthe tokar), understands that she can\u2019t answer people with brutality or else her\npeople will be afraid to come to her, and understands that she needs to be seen\ncaring about her people. She\nhas gained experience in managing the economy, avoiding corruption, commanding armies, diplomacy and\ncompromises. And she has gained a more mature understanding of peace and war.</p><p><a></a>Dany still has things to learn, of\ncourse. She has now decided on a fire and blood path. I do believe this is\nnecessary to end slavery and that making peace with the slavers was the wrong\nchoice. But it\u2019s also very likely that Dany will make mistakes, and at some\npoints, she might go too far with fire and blood.\u00a0\n\nShe has an even bigger internal conflict coming her way in The Winds of Winter: how far is Dany willing to go? What kind of violence is justified?\n\n But this is important for\nDany to learn. She won\u2019t become the perfect ruler in a single day. And Dany has\nan even bigger responsibility, because she owns the only dragons in the entire\nworld, and has to learn how to wield a huge power responsibly.</p><p><a></a>But regardless of what happens in future books, I do think that, given all I discussed here, Dany is a great leader and a great ruler.</p>",
                "content": "<p>For the longest time, I wanted to\nwrite about Dany as a leader and a ruler. Most of the time, the metas I see from\nDany haters just talk about what an awful ruler Dany is, and amongst Daenerys\nfans, this is usually not discussed a lot, mostly because I think Dany fans\nspend a lot of time defending Dany from the accusations that she is evil or\nmad, so other subjects are neglected. Before I start, I just want to make it\nclear that I am not any expert on medieval politics or war strategy, so this\nwill be mostly my understanding of the story. And of course, I can&rsquo;t forget to\nmention that many of the ideas of the Meereenese Blot are here as well, but\nthis is going to be my interpretation.</p><p>In this analysis, I will show why I\nthink Daenerys is an intelligent and capable leader and ruler. I want to look\nat everything we know about Dany in all of the books: her childhood and education,\nher political beliefs, her actions and the economic and political situation\nshe&rsquo;s in. I&rsquo;ll try to focus on what Dany has learned in each book, and how it\nhelped her become a better leader.</p><p>Some of the things I&rsquo;ll write here\nare similar to metas that I&rsquo;ve written before. But I want this one to be as\ncomplete as possible, and to analyze every facet of Dany&rsquo;s storyline as a ruler\nthat I can think of. I will bring book quotes to back up what I say, so this\nwill be <i>very</i> long (It&rsquo;s around 20k\nwords, so I hope at least someone will be interested in reading it, because I\nspent months scrutinizing all of the books to write this).</p><p>In this essay, I will talk about the following topics:</p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s childhood and education</b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s intelligence, wisdom and introspectiveness</b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s changing political views</b></p><p><b>Dany journey as a leader in A Game of Thrones</b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Clash of Kings</b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Storm of Swords<br /></b></p><p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Dance with Dragons:<br /></b></p><ul><li><b>Economy</b></li><li><b>The war against Yunkai and the question of peace and war</b></li><li><b>The question of taking the wealth of the slave masters</b></li><li><b>Conflicting interests within the city</b></li><li><b>Morality</b></li><li><b>Practical aspects or ruling</b></li><li><b>Dany&rsquo;s equalitarian practices</b></li><li><b>Some mistakes worth addressing</b></li></ul><p><b>Is Daenerys a good ruler? What did she learn?</b></p><p><b>DANY&rsquo;S CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION</b><br /></p><p>Dany spent her childhood poor,\nhomeless, and had to go from place to place, never stopping for too long. She\ndidn&rsquo;t have money or stability to have a formal education: </p><blockquote><p><i><b>After Ser Willem had died</b>, the servants had stolen what\nlittle money they had left, and soon after <b>they had been put out of the big\nhouse.</b> Dany had cried when the&nbsp;red&nbsp;door&nbsp;closed behind them\nforever.</i></p><p><i><b>They had wandered since then</b>, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr\nto Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, <b>never staying long in any one\nplace. </b>Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper&rsquo;s hired knives were close\nbehind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.</i></p><p><i><b>At first the magisters\nand archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to\ntheir homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to\nsit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner.</b> Years past\nthey had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin\nthey had gotten from Mother&rsquo;s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of\nPentos, they called her brother &ldquo;the beggar king.&rdquo; Dany did not want\nto know what they called her. &ndash; </i>Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Dany\nlater confirms that she indeed never had any formal education:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Tell me of this other Daenerys. <b>I know less than I\nshould of the history of my father&rsquo;s kingdom. I never had\na&nbsp;maester&nbsp;growing up.</b>&rdquo; Only a brother. &ndash; </i>Daenerys VIII ADWD<i></i></p></blockquote><p>But we also have this quote:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;A queen must listen to all,&rdquo; [&hellip;] <b>She had read that in a&nbsp;book.</b> &ndash; </i>Daenerys I ASOS<i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany spent her childhood poor,\nhomeless, without receiving a formal education. Most of what Dany knows comes\nfrom Viserys, from her own experience, and from a few books she has read. Given\nthat Dany and Viserys were poor, I imagine that the only times that Dany\nhad access to books were when they were guests at some archon&rsquo;s or prince&rsquo;s\nhome, and this was only in the beginning, before the doors started closing on\nthem. I think this is the first thing we need to know if we want to understand Dany&rsquo;s mistakes and beliefs, and not crucify her for them. Daenerys is not\nsupposed to start the story as a great leader who makes no mistakes. Her story,\nfrom the very beginning, is all about learning.</p><p><b>DANY&rsquo;S INTELLIGENCE, WISDOM AND INTROSPECTIVENESS</b></p><p>Despite lacking education and\nexperience, Dany shows herself to be very intelligent and wise.</p><p>Dany is observant, always aware of\nher situation, surroundings and of the people around her:</p><blockquote><p><i>Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he&rsquo;d never had a friend he wouldn&rsquo;t cheerfully sell for the right price. <b>Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things</b>, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. &ndash; </i>Daenerys I AGOT<br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The cobbler thanked her for that, and the old brickmaker kissed her foot, </i><b><i>but the weaver looked at her with eyes as hard as slate. She knows I lie, the queen thought.</i> </b>- Daenerys V ADWD<br /></p></blockquote><p>She is not\ngullible:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Why does he give\nus so much?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What does he want from us?&rdquo; For nigh on\nhalf a year, they had lived in the magister&rsquo;s house, eating his food, pampered\nby his servants. <b>Dany was thirteen, old\nenough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the\nfree city of Pentos.</b>&nbsp;&ndash; </i>Daenerys I AGOT<i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;They are your people, and they love you well,&rdquo;\nMagister Illyrio said amiably. &ldquo;In holdfasts all across the realm, men\nlift secret toasts to your&nbsp;health&nbsp;while women sew dragon banners and\nhide them against the day of your return from across the water.&rdquo; He gave a\nmassive shrug. &ldquo;Or so my agents tell me.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Dany had no agents, no way of\nknowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she\nmistrusted Illyrio&rsquo;s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio.</i></b><i> &ndash; </i>Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\ntook the warlock&rsquo;s words well salted</i></b><i>, but the magnificence of the great city was not to\nbe denied. &ndash; Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I do not\nunderstand her.&rdquo; <b>Pyat and Xaro had\nshowered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons,\ndeclaring themselves her loyal servants in all things,</b> but from Quaithe she\nhad gotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never\nseen the woman&rsquo;s face. <b>Remember&nbsp;Mirri&nbsp;Maz\nDuur, she told herself. Remember treachery. She turned to her bloodriders.\n&ldquo;We will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that no one enters\nthis wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that the dragons are always\nwell guarded.</b>&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Thirteen. To be sure.\nXaro was one of the Thirteen. No doubt he had convinced each of his fellow\nmembers to give up one ship. She knew the merchant prince too well to think\nthat he would sacrifice thirteen of his own ships. <b>&ldquo;I must consider this. May I inspect these ships?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You\nhave grown suspicious, Daenerys.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>Always.\n&ldquo;I have grown wise, Xaro.&rdquo; </i></b>- Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>But at the same time, Dany is not\nparanoid, and she knows that she needs to take risks to get what she wants or\nneeds:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;It\nseems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts\neveryone. Every man I take into my service is a&nbsp;risk, I understand that,\nbut how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such&nbsp;risks? Am I to conquer\nWesteros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?&rdquo;</i></b><i> </i>&ndash; Daenerys I ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I am glad you\ncame to me. It is good to see your face again, my friend.&rdquo; <b>I will not trust you, but I need you. I\nneed your Thirteen, I need your ships, I need your trade.</b> </i>- Daenerys III\nADWD</p></blockquote><p>We\ncontinue to see this attitude in all of the books, with good, bad and uncertain\nresults: Dany trusts Barristan, which was a good thing. Despite being warned by\nQuaithe&rsquo;s prophecies and the prophecies of the House of the Undying, Dany is\nnot paranoid about them. She is aware of the danger from Reznak (who she thinks\nis the perfumed seneschal) and Quentyn (the Sun&rsquo;s son), the danger from\nsellswords and people in her court, but she tries to make use of everyone even\nthough she doesn&rsquo;t fully trust them, trying not to be gullible but without\nbeing paranoid.</p><p>Dany\nis very adaptable and respects different cultures, which enables her to survive\ndifferent situations, while her brother fails:</p><blockquote><p><i>Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse\nrearing beneath him as he reined up too hard. &ldquo;You dare!&rdquo; he screamed\nat her. &ldquo;You give commands to me? To me?&rdquo; He vaulted off the horse,\nstumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet.\nHe grabbed her, shook her. &ldquo;Have you forgotten who you are?

I know less than I\nshould of the history of my father&rsquo;s kingdom.</b> I never had\na&nbsp;maester&nbsp;growing up.&rdquo; Only a brother. &ndash; </i>Daenerys VIII ADWD<i></i></p></blockquote><p>This\ngift for self-reflection is something we see constantly in ADWD as well, while\nDany ponders what&rsquo;s the best course of action in Meereen.</p><p>Dany\nis pragmatic. In Vaes Tolorro, her people don&rsquo;t want to enter the city out of\nfear, but Dany insists:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I\nfear no&nbsp;ghosts. Dragons are more powerful than&nbsp;ghosts.&rdquo;<b> And figs\nare more important.</b></i><i>\n&ndash; Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>We\ncan also see her pragmatism in relation to war and conquest:</p><blockquote><p><i>The thought of home disquieted her. If her sun-and-stars had\nlived, he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away\nher enemies, but his strength had left the world. Her bloodriders remained,\nsworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the ways of the\nhorselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, they did not\nrule them. <b>Dany had no wish to reduce\nKing&rsquo;s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts. She had supped\nenough on tears. I want to make my kingdom beautiful, to fill it with fat men\nand pretty maids and laughing children.

The old gods and the new\nalike hold slavery to be an abomination. Evil. If you should land in Westeros\nat the head of a slave army, many good men will oppose you for no other reason\nthan that. You will do great harm to your cause, and to the honor of your\nHouse.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Yet I must have some\narmy,&rdquo; Dany said. &ldquo;The boy&nbsp;Joffrey&nbsp;will not give me the\nIron Throne for asking politely.&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys\nII ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis politically intelligent. She very easily sees the political consequences of\nRobert&rsquo;s death (she doesn&rsquo;t have the full picture, but she very quickly\nunderstands the flaws in her reasoning when Jorah points it out):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Before,\nthe Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo's&nbsp;khalasar, a hundred thousand made\nas one by his strength. Now they fly to pieces, even as\nthe&nbsp;khalasar&nbsp;did after my khal lay dead.&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\ncan see Hizdahr&rsquo;s true intention behind the reopening of the fighting pits, and\nshe&rsquo;s capable of making an analysis of the political and economic situation\nshe&rsquo;s in:</p><blockquote><p><i>I need this man, Dany\nreminded herself. <b>Hizdahr was a wealthy\nmerchant with many friends in Meereen, and more across the seas.

Famously and fabulously rich &hellip;</i></p><p><b><i>And like to grow richer, if I grant\nhis petition.

Half of her\nfreedmen were from Yunkai, where the Wise Masters had been famed for training\nbedslaves. The way of the seven sighs. <b>Brothels\nhad sprouted up like mushrooms all over Meereen.

But never question me in front of strangers.</b> Is that\nunderstood?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The rest of her people\nfollowed: Groleo and the other captains and their crews, and the eighty-three\nDothraki who remained to her of the hundred thousand who had once ridden in\nDrogo&rsquo;s khalasar. <b>She put the oldest and\nweakest on the inside of the column, with the nursing women and those with\nchild, and the little girls, and the boys too young to braid their hair. The\nrest&mdash;her warriors, such as they were&mdash;rode outside</b> and moved their dismal\nherd along, the hundred-odd gaunt horses that had survived\nboth&nbsp;red&nbsp;waste&nbsp;and black salt sea. &ndash; Daenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>She thinks a ruler must keep a cool head and be merciful:<br /></p><blockquote><p>If I wed Hizdahr, will that turn Skahaz against me? She trusted Skahaz more than she trusted Hizdahr, but <b>the Shavepate would be a disaster as a king. He was too quick to anger, too slow to forgive. </b>- Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>She\nunderstands that she needs to be seen caring for her people:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Go if you wish,\nser. I will not detain you. I will not detain any of you.&rdquo; Dany vaulted\ndown from the horse. <b>&ldquo;I cannot heal\nthem, but I can show them that their Mother cares.&rdquo;</b> - Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>But even though she has to keep up\nappearances, she tries to be just:</p><blockquote><p><i>Her name had been&nbsp;Hazzea. She was four years old.\nUnless her father lied. He might have lied. No one had seen the dragon but him.\nHis proof was burned bones, but burned bones proved nothing. He might have\nkilled the little girl himself, and burned her afterward. He would not have\nbeen the first father to dispose of an unwanted girl child, the Shavepate\nclaimed. The Sons of the Harpy might have done it, and made it look like\ndragon&rsquo;s work to make the city hate me. Dany wanted to believe that &hellip; but if\nthat was so, why had Hazzea&rsquo;s father waited until the audience hall was almost\nempty to come forward? If his purpose had been to inflame the Meereenese\nagainst her, he would have told his tale when the hall was full of ears to\nhear.</i></p><p><i>The Shavepate had urged her to put the man to death.\n&ldquo;At least rip out his tongue. This man&rsquo;s lie could destroy us all,\nMagnificence.&rdquo; Instead Dany chose to pay the blood price. No one could\ntell her the worth of a daughter, so she set it at one hundred times the worth\nof a lamb. <b>&ldquo;I would give Hazzea back to you if I could,&rdquo; she told the\nfather, &ldquo;but some things are beyond the power of even a queen. Her bones shall be laid to rest in the\nTemple of the Graces, and a hundred candles shall burn day and night in her\nmemory. Come back to me each year upon her nameday, and your other children\nshall not want &hellip; but this tale must never pass your lips again.&rdquo; </b>&ndash;\nDaenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This quote shows that Dany is smart\nand capable of analysing the situation to conclude that Hazzea&rsquo;s father was\ntelling the truth. She knows that she has to keep the tale from spreading, but\nshe also understands that it&rsquo;s important to be fair to her people, so she\nchooses to be kind and be just to Hazzea&rsquo;s father.</p><p>With all of this being said, I think\nDany has many qualities of a great ruler.</p><p><b>DANY&rsquo;S CHANGING POLITICAL VIEWS</b></p><p>Thanks to Dany&rsquo;s ability for\nself-reflection, Dany changes her political views throughout the story due to\nher experiences. She starts the story as a very na&iuml;ve girl who doesn&rsquo;t truly\nunderstands the costs of war and conquest, asking her husband to invade the\nSeven Kingdoms without really realizing what the consequences would be. First,\nshe tries to convince Drogo several times, unsuccessfully. Then, the wineseller tries to\npoison her and Drogo decides to cross the narrow sea. He attacks the Lhazareen\nto pay for the ships, and Dany finally sees the consequences of her actions:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>Slaves, Dany thought.</b>\nKhal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver&rsquo;s Bay. <b>She\nwanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. This is war, this\nis what it looks like, this is the price of the&nbsp;Iron&nbsp;Throne.</b> &ndash;\nDaenerys VII AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>But\nDany is unable to ignore the horror, and two paragraphs later, she tries to put\na stop at least to the rapes, with the little power she has. She defies\nDothraki culture and Drogo&rsquo;s men, putting herself at risk:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Behind&nbsp;them,\nthe girl being raped made a heartrending sound,</i></b><i> a long sobbing wail\nthat went on and on and on. Dany&rsquo;s hand clenched hard around the reins, and she\nturned the silver&rsquo;s head. <b>&ldquo;Make&nbsp;them&nbsp;stop,&rdquo;\nshe commanded Ser Jorah.</b> &ndash; Daenerys VII AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>Later, Dany reflects on what she\nthinks is acceptable in war and conquest, trying to be pragmatic but without\nunnecessary bloodshed:</p><blockquote><p><i>Blood&nbsp;and fire, thought Dany. The words of House\nTargaryen. She had known them all her life. <b>&ldquo;The&nbsp;blood&nbsp;of my enemies I will shed gladly.\nThe&nbsp;blood&nbsp;of&nbsp;innocents&nbsp;is another matter.</b> Eight\nthousand Unsullied they would offer me. Eight thousand dead babes. Eight\nthousand strangled dogs.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; she\ncorrected. &ldquo;Prince Rhaegar led free men into battle, not slaves.\nWhitebeard said he dubbed his squires himself, and made many other knights as\nwell.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;There was no higher honor than to receive your\nknighthood from the&nbsp;Prince&nbsp;of&nbsp;Dragonstone.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Tell me, then&mdash;when he touched\na man on the shoulder with his sword, what did he say? &lsquo;Go forth and kill the\nweak&rsquo;? Or 'Go forth and defend them&rsquo;?</i></b><i> At the\nTrident, those brave men Viserys spoke of who died beneath our dragon\nbanners&mdash;did they give their lives because they believed in Rhaegar&rsquo;s cause, or\nbecause they had been bought and paid for?&rdquo; Dany turned to Mormont,\ncrossed her arms, and waited for an answer. &ndash; Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Another thing that changes are her\nviews on slavery. Dany starts as someone who lives in a slave society and has\nno strong feelings against slavery. While she was living with Illyrio, she had\nslaves serving her, and with the Dothraki, she had slave servants as well.\nBut as soon as Drogo dies, Dany frees her slaves.<i> </i>Even then, while Dany no longer has slaves herself, she has no\nstrong feelings about the slaves in Qarth, and even considers buying a slave\narmy. But when Dany sees the horrors in Astapor and understands what slavery\ntruly means, she turns away from it:</p><blockquote><p><i>Xaro&nbsp;caught it in the air and took a bite. &ldquo;Whence\ncame this madness? Should I count myself fortunate that you did not free my\nown&nbsp;slaves&nbsp;when you were my guest in Qarth?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>I was a beggar queen and you were Xaro of the Thirteen, Dany\nthought, and all you wanted were my dragons. <b>&ldquo;Your slaves seemed well treated and content. It was not till\nAstapor that my eyes were opened. Do you know how Unsullied are made and\ntrained?&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And despite being raised by Viserys,\nDany was able to think on her on view on what a king should be, and what are\nher duties as a monarch:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I was alone for a long time, Jorah. All alone but for\nmy brother. I was such a small scared thing. <b>Viserys should have protected me, but instead he hurt me and scared me\nworse. He shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. He wasn&rsquo;t just my brother, he was my king.\nWhy do the gods make kings and queens, if not to protect the ones who can&rsquo;t\nprotect themselves?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Some kings make\nthemselves.&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;did.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He was no true king,&rdquo; Dany said scornfully.\n&ldquo;He did no justice. <b>Justice &hellip;\nthat&rsquo;s what kings are for.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>A&nbsp;queen&nbsp;belongs&nbsp;not\nto herself but to her people.</i></b><i>\n&ndash; Daenerys V ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys was only able to change her\nviews and become a more conscious ruler because of her self-reflection and\nempathy, and this is one of the things that sets her apart as a leader. With\nall that being said, let&rsquo;s see Dany&rsquo;s journey in each of the books.</p><p><b>FINDING HER WAY IN THE WORLD</b></p><p>The first two books are, in my\nopinion, about Daenerys finding out what she wants and what to do. It&rsquo;s the\nbeginning of her journey as a leader, and she&rsquo;s going on instinct, trying to\nfind out what to do.</p><p><b>A GAME OF THRONES</b></p><p>People usually look at this book as\nthe story of a scared little girl overcoming abuse and becoming stronger. This\nis all true, but this is also the book where Dany starts to develop her\nleadership skills. In this book, Dany learns how to be more assertive and how\nto deal with this new authority that is given to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo;\nDany told Ser Jorah. <b>&ldquo;Tell them all\nto stay. Tell them I command it.&rdquo;</b></i><i></i></p><p><i>The knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had\na neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and\nchest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his smiles gave\nDany comfort. <b>&ldquo;You are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Not a&nbsp;queen,&rdquo; said Dany.\n&ldquo;A&nbsp;khaleesi.&rdquo; </b>She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the\nridge alone. &ndash; Daenerys III AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>Unlike Viserys, Dany learns about\nDothraki culture and adapts to it. This allows her to gain more respect than\nher brother:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Take</b>&nbsp;<b>his</b>&nbsp;<b>horse</b>,&rdquo;\nDany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he\nwas hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words\ncame. <b>&ldquo;Let my brother walk behind\nus back to the khalasar.&rdquo; Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride\nwas no man at all, the lowest of the low, without honor or pride. &ldquo;Let\neveryone see him as he is.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys III AGOT</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany understands that Dothraki\nculture strongly associates strength with the ability to ride. So she makes a\nconscious choice to show all of the khalasar what Viserys really is, showing\nherself stronger than her brother. And we start to see just how much Viserys\nignorance is detrimental to his potential ability to lead the Dothraki:</p><blockquote><p><i>(&hellip;) <b>the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal\nRhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King. Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the\nnext day, and Viserys had accepted. In his stubborn ignorance, he had not even\nknown he was being mocked</b>; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women\ngiving birth, the very young and the very old. That won him yet another name:\nKhal&nbsp;Rhaggat, the Cart King. Her brother had thought it was the khal&rsquo;s way\nof apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah not to\ntell him the truth, lest he be shamed. &ndash; </i>Daenerys\nIV AGOT</p></blockquote><p>Because Viserys refuses to learn and\nadapt to other cultures, he loses respects, while Dany gains the respect of the\nDothraki. She respects their culture and shows her strength by eating the\nstallion&rsquo;s horse, riding with them until the end of her pregnancy, and\nasserting herself.</p><p>This new authority that Dany gains\nalso means that Dany sees herself more and more free of her brother&rsquo;s\ninfluence. She gets the chance of getting a new perspective on Westeros through\nJorah, without her brother&rsquo;s biases:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;The common people pray for\nrain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,&rdquo;</i></b><i> Ser Jorah told her. <b>&ldquo;It\nis no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as\nthey are left in peace.&rdquo; </b>He gave a shrug. <b>&ldquo;They never are.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a\npuzzle box. <b>It went against everything\nthat Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little\nwhether a true&nbsp;king&nbsp;or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she\nthought on Jorah&rsquo;s words, the more they rang of truth. </b>&ndash; Daenerys III AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>She talks with Jorah about if it\nwould be possible for the Dothraki to conquer Westeros, trying to gather the\ninformation that she&rsquo;ll need, and even starts believing that someone else could\nconquer the Seven Kingdoms (herself):</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany could not pretend\nto surprise at the disdain in his tone. </i><b><i>&ldquo;What\n&hellip; what if it were not Viserys?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;If it were someone else\nwho led them? Someone stronger? Could the Dothraki&nbsp;truly&nbsp;conquer&nbsp;the&nbsp;Seven&nbsp;Kingdoms?&rdquo;</i> </b>- Daenerys IV AGOT<b><i></i></b></p></blockquote><p>This is also the book in which Dany\nstarts dealing with the many moral dilemmas that she encounters in her story:\nshe wants to conquer the Seven Kingdoms, but once she sees that Drogo attacks\nthe Lhazareen to fund the invasion, she sees the costs of war for the first\ntime, and stands up to Drogo&rsquo;s men to protect the women from being raped.\nLater, after Drogo dies, Dany frees her slaves and asks people to follow her,\npromising to protect them and care for them:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;You will be my khalasar,&rdquo; she told them. <b>&ldquo;I see the faces of&nbsp;slaves. I\nfree you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one shall harm you. If you\nstay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.&rdquo;</b> The\nblack eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. &ldquo;I see the children, women,\nthe wrinkled faces of the aged. I was a child yesterday. Today I am a woman.\nTomorrow I will be old. <b>To each of you I\nsay, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for\nyou.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys X AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>But it&rsquo;s important to note that even\nthough Dany has more power than she starts the book with, for most of the book,\nthe power is not truly hers, it comes from Drogo. Before Dany hatches her\ndragons, she has to use Drogo&rsquo;s name to make herself be obeyed, and has to\nresort to things like bed tricks. Even then, she is not always successful. I\nthink it&rsquo;s very interesting that before Dany truly has her own power, she has\nto deal with what any woman would have to deal &ndash; trying to manipulate her\nhusband to have power and get what she wants. It&rsquo;s only at the end of the book\nthat Dany steps up as khaleesi in her own right. Initially, Aggo, Jhogo and\nRakharo refuse to follow her because she&rsquo;s a woman, but Dany insists, because\nshe knows that when she steps out of the fire and shows her strength, the\nkhalasar will follow her:</p><blockquote><p><i>Wordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her khas\ncame up behind him. Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet.\n&ldquo;Blood of my blood,&rdquo; he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking\nearth. &ldquo;Blood of my blood,&rdquo; she heard Aggo echo. &ldquo;Blood of my\nblood,&rdquo; Rakharo shouted.</i></p><p><i>And after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all\nthe Dothraki, men and women and children, and <b>Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now,\ntoday and tomorrow and&nbsp;forever, hers as they had never been Drogo&rsquo;s.</b> &ndash;\nDaenerys X AGOT</i></p></blockquote><p>A Game of Thrones is an essential\npart of Dany&rsquo;s growth as a leader. She learns that to be respected and\naccepted, she needs to integrate into the community and understand the culture\nthat she is in. She gains a new perspective on Westeros and on war, frees\nherself from Viserys&rsquo; abuse, and builds the necessary strength and confidence\nto lead her people in the future.</p><p><b>A CLASH OF KINGS</b></p><p>Now, for the first time in her life,\nDany has power on her own, and people look up to her for guidance. To survive\nthe Red Waste, Dany leads by showing an example of strength:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>They\nare not strong, she told herself, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;must&nbsp;be their&nbsp;strength.</i></b><i>&nbsp;<b>I&nbsp;must&nbsp;show no fear, no weakness,\nno doubt.</b> However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face\nthey&nbsp;must&nbsp;see only Drogo&rsquo;s queen. She felt older than her fourteen\nyears. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was done. &ndash; Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nkeeps her people together by respecting their culture and traditions:</p><blockquote><p><i>Three days into the march, the first man died. A toothless\noldster with cloudy blue eyes, he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not\nrise again. An hour later he was done. Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and\ncarried his ill luck to the living. &ldquo;His time was past,&rdquo; her handmaid\nIrri declared. &ldquo;No man should live longer than his teeth.&rdquo; The others\nagreed. <b>Dany bid them kill the weakest\nof their dying&nbsp;horses, so the dead man might go mounted into the night\nlands.</b></i></p><p><i>Two nights later, it was an infant girl who perished. Her\nmother&rsquo;s anguished wailing lasted all day, but there was nothing to be done. <b>The child had been too young to ride, poor\nthing. Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands; she must be born\nagain.</b> &ndash; Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She also leads them and keeps them\ntogether by showing that she cares about them. She doesn&rsquo;t see herself above\nher people, and because of this, she starves with them and cares for them:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Dany\nhungered and thirsted with the rest of them.</i></b><i> The milk in her breasts dried up, her nipples\ncracked and bled, and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was\nlean and hard as a stick, yet it was her dragons she feared for.&nbsp;&ndash;\nDaenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Doreah&nbsp;took a\nfever and grew worse with every league they crossed. Her lips and hands broke\nwith blood blisters, her hair came out in clumps, and one evenfall she lacked\nthe strength to mount her horse. Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to\nher saddle, but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea, when the Lysene\ngirl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more. <b>She gave&nbsp;Doreah&nbsp;water from her\nown skin, cooled her brow with a damp cloth, and held her hand until she died,\nshivering. Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on.</b> &ndash; Daenerys\nI ACOK</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>She keeps them alive by being\npragmatic, like when she insists in entering the abandoned city, breaking the\ntaboo of the Dothraki against such places because they need food:</p><blockquote><p><i>Other searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees,\nhidden behind closed doors in secret gardens. Aggo showed her a courtyard\novergrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes, and Jhogo discovered a\nwell where the water was pure and cold. Yet they found bones too, the skulls of\nthe unburied dead, bleached and broken. &ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; Irri muttered.\n&ldquo;Terrible ghosts. We must not stay here, Khaleesi, this is their\nplace.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I fear no ghosts. Dragons are\nmore powerful than ghosts.&rdquo; And&nbsp;figs&nbsp;are more important.</i></b><i>&nbsp;&ndash; Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>And she saves her people by making\nthe sensible choice of sending her bloodriders in different directions to find\na way out of the desert:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;What shall we seek, Khaleesi?&rdquo; asked Jhogo.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Whatever there is,&rdquo; Dany answered. &ldquo;Seek for\nother&nbsp;cities, living and dead. Seek for caravans and people. Seek for\nrivers and lakes and the great salt sea. Find how far this waste extends before\nus, and what lies on the other side. <b>When\nI leave this place, I do not mean to strike out blind again. I will know where\nI am bound, and how best to get there.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys I ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>All of these actions enabled her to\nkeep her khalasar together and keep their loyalty. And after many deaths and\nsuffering, they finally get to Qarth.</p><p>But when they arrive in Qarth, there\nare more challenges. Dany thinks that she&rsquo;ll find something in the city:</p><blockquote><p><i>The&nbsp;Bleeding&nbsp;Star&nbsp;led\nme to Qarth for a purpose. <b>Here I will\nfind what I need, if I have the strength to take what is offered, and the\nwisdom to avoid the traps and snares.</b> If the gods mean for me to conquer,\nthey will provide, they will send me a sign, and if not &hellip; if not &hellip; &ndash;\nDaenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>And this quote establishes Dany&rsquo;s\narc in this book very well, because this part of her story is a test for\nher as a leader, and she learns some important lessons. She has to escape\ndifferent deceptions, and Dany is careful about that. Even with all their\nflatteries, she doesn&rsquo;t trust Xaro and Pyat Pree, and takes precautions against\nthem:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I do not understand her.&rdquo; Pyat and Xaro had\nshowered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her&nbsp;dragons,\ndeclaring themselves her loyal servants in all things, but from Quaithe she had\ngotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never seen\nthe woman&rsquo;s face. Remember Mirri Maz Duur, she told herself. <b>Remember treachery. She turned to her\nbloodriders. &ldquo;We will keep our own watch so long as we are here. See that\nno one enters this wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that\nthe&nbsp;dragons&nbsp;are always well&nbsp;guarded.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It shall be done, Khaleesi,&rdquo; Aggo said.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;We have seen only the parts of\nQarth that&nbsp;Pyat&nbsp;Pree wished us to see,&rdquo; she went on.\n&ldquo;Rakharo, go forth and look on the rest, and tell me what you find. Take\ngood men with you&mdash;and women, to go places where men are forbidden.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;As you say, I do, blood of my blood,&rdquo; said\nRakharo.</i>\n&ndash; Daenerys II ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Later,\nDany also escapes treachery by refusing to fall for Xaro&rsquo;s bad deal (he had\noffered her 30 ships for one dragon):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;I\nam trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in\nthe&nbsp;world.&ldquo; Dany smiled at him sweetly. \"It seems to me that\none-third of all the&nbsp;ships&nbsp;in the&nbsp;world&nbsp;would be\nfair.&rdquo;</i></b><i>\n&ndash; Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso sends Jorah to find out about news from Westeros and to find ships that\ncould take them:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Ser\nJorah, find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor. It has been\nhalf a year since I last heard tidings from the Seven Kingdoms. Perhaps the\ngods will have blown some good captain here from Westeros with a ship to carry\nus home.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>The knight frowned. &ldquo;That would be no kindness. The\nUsurper will kill you, sure as sunrise.&rdquo; Mormont hooked his thumbs through\nhis swordbelt. &ldquo;My&nbsp;place&nbsp;is here at&nbsp;your&nbsp;side.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Jhogo can guard me as well. <b>You have more languages than my bloodriders, and the Dothraki mistrust\nthe sea and those who sail her. Only you can serve me in this.</b> Go among the\nships and speak to the crews, learn where they are from and where they are\nbound and what manner of men command them.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys II ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p>The interesting thing here is that\nDany can see the strengths in each of her men and can use them accordingly. She\nknows that Ser Jorah is the most adequate person to entrust this task to, and\nthis shows her abilities as a leader, because a leader must know the people under her command.</p><p>Dany is not only trying to escape\ndeception, but she&rsquo;s also trying to get help to conquer Westeros. She tries to\nbribe the Pureborn and follow Qartheen traditions, but it doesn&rsquo;t work. Soon,\nDany starts to realize that she won&rsquo;t find help to conquer Westeros as a beggar:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Yet\neven crowned, I am a&nbsp;beggar&nbsp;still, Dany thought.</i></b><i> I have become the most\nsplendid&nbsp;beggar&nbsp;in the world, but a&nbsp;beggar&nbsp;all the same.\nShe hated it, as her brother must have. All those years of running from city to\ncity one step ahead of the Usurper&rsquo;s knives, pleading for help from archons and\nprinces and magisters, buying our food with flattery. He must have known how\nthey mocked him. Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter. In the end it had\ndriven him mad. It will do the same to me if I let it. Part of her would have\nliked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro, and make the\ndead city bloom. No, that is defeat. I have something Viserys never had. I have\nthe dragons. The dragons are all the difference. &ndash; Daenerys III ACOK</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Qarth is also important for Dany&rsquo;s\narc as a leader because it&rsquo;s a place of temptation. Qarth is a city filled with\nsplendors: it&rsquo;s beautiful, it has magic, it&rsquo;s wealthy. And both Xaro and Pyat\nPree are offering them to Dany. If she stays with Pyat Pree, she will have\nsorceries and magical knowledge at her disposal. If she stays with Xaro, she\nwill be a wealthy woman for the rest of her life. But if she does that, she\nwill have to stay in Qarth forever and will never achieve her true desire, to\ngo home to Westeros. This is a moment in her arc in which Dany has to decide\nwhat she truly wants: does she want a life of luxury or does she want to pursue\na greater destiny for herself? In the end, Dany decides to leave Qarth and make\nher own path.</p><p>In this book, Dany has successfully\nled her people through the desert through strength, pragmatism and determination, and has\nescaped Qarth because of her cleverness. She has also finally decided what she\nwants for herself:</p><blockquote><p><i>Three heads has the dragon, Dany thought, wondering. <b>&ldquo;I shall tell my people to make ready\nto depart at once. But the ships that bring me home must bear different\nnames.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; said Arstan.\n&ldquo;What&nbsp;names&nbsp;would you&nbsp;prefer?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Vhagar,&rdquo; Daenerys told\nhim. &ldquo;Meraxes. And Balerion. Paint the names on their hulls in golden\nletters three feet high, Arstan. I want every man who sees them to know the\ndragons are returned.&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys V ACOK</i></p></blockquote><p><b>SHAPING THE WORLD</b></p><p>The\nthird and fifth book are the ones in which Dany starts to more actively shape\nthe world around her. While in the first two books, Dany is leading through her\nstrength, adaptation to culture, instinct and pragmatism, now she finally\nstarts to deal with more complex issues. She no longer leads a small khalasar &ndash;\nshe has to deal with big armies and thousands of different and diverse people.\nShe&rsquo;s no longer just defying Dothraki tradition &ndash; she is fighting against a\ncontinent wide system of slavery. She has to deal with military strategy, food,\ntrade, diplomacy, peace and war, and this is the moment in which Dany grows the\nmost, reflects on what is means to be a ruler, and on what it means to be a revolutionary.</p><p><b>A STORM OF SWORDS</b></p><p>In\nthis book, we see both Dany&rsquo;s brilliance and inexperience. She has huge\nvictories, but also makes huge mistakes.</p><p>The\nbook starts with Dany going to Illyrio, until Jorah points out that going there\nwithout an army would be risky. He convinces Dany to go to Astapor to buy the\nUnsullied. There, she sees the horrors of slavery and decides to start her\nliberation of the slaves.</p><p>In\neach of the cities, Dany makes brilliant plans. In Astapor, Dany pretends that\nshe doesn&rsquo;t speak Valyrian, at Ser Jorah&rsquo;s suggestion, to get to hear what\nKraznis doesn&rsquo;t want her to hear. But she also sets in motion a plan that she\ncreates all on her own: she asks Jorah how Astapor is defended, and later asks\nMissandei if the things Kraznis told her were true, to get more information\nbefore she acts. Then, she uses a Qartheen dress look more wealthy, and\nsuccessfully negotiates with the slavers, managing to buy all of the Unsullied\nso that her plan can work. She refuses to let Ser Barristan undermine her,\nordering him to be taken away from her presence when he speaks out of turn.\nWhile setting her plan in motion, she dresses in Dothraki clothes and puts the\nweakest of her people inside the column, with the warriors outside, in order to\nappear more intimidating. And before she turns on the masters, she makes sure\nto tell the Unsullied that she has paid for them, and they belong to her now,\nso that they know they no longer have to be loyal to the Astapori masters. It\nwas a very risky plan, and if it failed, Dany and all of her people would have\ndied. But Dany took all the steps necessary for it to be a success.</p><p>In\nYunkai, she tells the sellswords that she wants answers to her offers on the\nnext day, gives the Second Sons wine to get them drunk, and tells the Yukish\nenvoy that they have three days to think. Then, she organizes a surprise\nattack, defeating the sellsword companies almost with no bloodshed and with\neven fewer losses on her side.</p><p>In\nMeereen, Dany doesn&rsquo;t have surprise on her side, since the Meereenese have come\nto expect an attack and hid behind their walls. She understands the necessity\nof facing Meereen&rsquo;s champion (&ldquo;If I&nbsp;ignore&nbsp;this any longer, my own\npeople will think me&nbsp;weak&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys V ASOS), but carefully chooses who\nwill face this champion:</p><blockquote><p><b>Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo were brave warriors, but they were young, and too valuable to risk. They kept her khalasar together, and were her best scouts too.</b> - Daenerys V ASOS<br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his city I want, not his meager manhood.&rdquo; She was growing angry, however. <b>If I ignore this any longer, my own people will think me weak.</b> <b>Yet who could she send? She needed Daario as much as she did her bloodriders. Without the flamboyant Tyroshi, she had no hold on the Stormcrows, </b>many of whom had been followers of Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor the Bald. - Daenerys V ASOS<br /></p></blockquote><p>Once again, Dany shows\nherself as a capable leader, one that understands the importance and strengths\nof each men under her command. So she ends up sending Belwas, reasoning that:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Strong&nbsp;Belwas&nbsp;was\na slave here in the fighting pits. <b>If this&nbsp;highborn&nbsp;Oznak should fall\nto such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if he wins &hellip; well, it is a\npoor victory for one so noble</b>, one that Meereen can take no pride in.&rdquo; <b>And\nunlike Ser Jorah, Daario, Brown Ben, and her three bloodriders, the eunuch did\nnot lead troops, plan battles, or give her counsel. </b>He does nothing but eat and\nboast and bellow at Arstan.&nbsp;<b>Belwas&nbsp;was the man she could most easily\nspare. And it was time she learned what sort of protector Magister Illyrio had\nsent her.</b> </i>&ndash; Daenerys V ASOS</p></blockquote><p>She\nalso takes care of Belwas, which is good to show her people that she cares\nabout them. But this is not enough to take the city, of course. The Meereenese\nburnt all the trees, so Dany can&rsquo;t build siege weapons. There are heads of harpies\nabove the gates to pour boiling oil, and she doesn&rsquo;t have enough food to feed\nher people (and can&rsquo;t take it from land, since the slavers burned the trees). Her\nadvisors tell her to leave Meereen behind and go to Westeros, and let her\npeople starve on the march. But Dany refuses to leave her people to die, and\nshe refuses to unnecessarily waste the lives of the Unsullied to assault the\nwalls under attack of boiling oil. Instead, Dany shows her resourcefulness &ndash;\nshe makes siege weapons out of the ships that Illyrio sent her, and sends\nsoldiers to strike the chains of the slaves in the pits so they could also help\nher take the city from within.</p><p>Dany\nproves herself to be very intelligent, showing creativeness, resourcefulness,\nunderstanding of the different people that serve her and how each can be useful\nfor her, understanding of the need to keep up appearances and manipulate\npeople&rsquo;s perceptions, and showing that she cares for her people. But\nintelligence alone isn&rsquo;t enough. This book is also the one in which we see how\nher naivety, inexperience and lack of education impacts badly on her, and leads\nher to make mistakes.</p><p>In\nAstapor, she doesn&rsquo;t leave any army behind to protect the city. Because of\nthat, the council that she left governing is easily overthrown by the Butcher\nKing. In Yunkai, she doesn&rsquo;t really conquer the city, and leaves the masters\nstill in power. Then, as soon as she leaves, the masters enslave everyone\nagain. These mistakes also have serious consequences for Dany&rsquo;s future reign in\nMeereen: because of them, Dany will later have to deal with Astapori refugees, a plague, and with the city of Yunkai making alliances against her and besieging her\ncity.</p><p>These\nare mistakes that show her inexperience, and lack of formal education, but they\nalso show that Dany had bad advisors: both Jorah and Barristan don&rsquo;t really\ncare about Dany&rsquo;s anti-slavery campaign. They constantly tell her that she has\nnothing to gain here, and that she should just go to Westeros. Because none of\nthem is interested in ending slavery, they don&rsquo;t warn Dany about the mistakes\nthat she is making: they don&rsquo;t advise her to leave an army in Astapor, and they\ndon&rsquo;t tell her what&rsquo;s going to happen when she leaves Yunkai. Both of them are\nmore educated and experienced than her, and yet they tell her nothing.</p><p>Another\nthing that has consequences in the future is the question of bad faith. Dany\ndoes care about being honorable and upholding certain deals:</p><blockquote><p><i>Strong Belwas drew his\narakh. &ldquo;Strong Belwas will give his ugly tongue to the little queen, if\nshe likes.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No,\nBelwas. I have given these men my safe conduct.&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys IV ASOS</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>But at the same time, Dany&rsquo;s battle plans in Astapor and\nYunkai both involved deceit, and she also uses her dragons to intimidate an\nenvoy. This deceit was necessary, though: Dany starts with no army, and she&rsquo;s\nat a disadvantage when dealing with the slavers. It was certainly the right\nthing to do, and the best she could do in her circumstances. But of course, it\nwill still have consequences in the future, during her efforts to make peace,\nbecause the slavers don&rsquo;t trust her:<i></i></p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Ah, there is the thorn in the bower, my queen,&rdquo;\nsaid Hizdahr zo Loraq. <b>&ldquo;Sad to say,\nYunkai has no faith in your promises. They keep plucking the same string on the\nharp, about some envoy that your dragons set on fire.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Only his&nbsp;tokar&nbsp;was&nbsp;burned,&rdquo; said\nDany scornfully.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Be that as it may, they do not\ntrust you.</i></b><i> The men of New Ghis feel the same.\nWords are wind, as you yourself have so oft said. No words of yours will secure\nthis peace for Meereen. Your foes require deeds. They would see us wed, and\nthey would see me crowned as king, to rule beside you.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys\ncan&rsquo;t unmake her mistakes. But thankfully, she learns from them. She refuses\nto leave Meereen behind, like she did in Astapor and Yunkai. And later in the\nnext book, Dany is very mindful of what might happen to her city if she takes\nher army away, showing that she learned from her mistake in Astapor:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I know that the Mother of Dragons will not abandon us\nin our hour of peril. Lend us your Unsullied to defend our walls.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>And if I do, who\nwill&nbsp;defend&nbsp;my&nbsp;walls?</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys\nIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Westeros.\nHome. But if she left, what would happen to her city?</i></b><i> - Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Meet the\nfoe,&rdquo; she echoed, &ldquo;with the freedmen you&rsquo;ve called half-trained and\nunblooded.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We were all\nunblooded once, Your Grace. The Unsullied will help stiffen them. If I had five\nhundred knights &hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Or\nfive. And if I give you the Unsullied, I will have no one but the Brazen Beasts\nto hold Meereen.&rdquo;</i></b><i>\nWhen Ser Barristan did not dispute her, Dany closed her eyes. Gods, she prayed,\nyou took Khal Drogo, who was my sun-and-stars. You took our valiant son before\nhe drew a breath. You have had your blood of me. Help me now, I pray you. Give\nme the wisdom to see the path ahead and the strength to do what I must to keep\nmy children safe. - Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso understands her mistakes in leaving Yunkai untaken and leaving the masters\nin power:</p><blockquote><p><i>His new Unsullied are\nan obscene jape. &ldquo;King Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens and let\nthe Yunkai'i tend theirs.&rdquo; It was not that Dany harbored any love\nfor&nbsp;Yunkai. <b>She was coming to\nregret leaving the Yellow City untaken after defeating its army in the field.\nThe Wise Masters had returned to slaving as soon as she moved on, and were busy\nraising levies, hiring sellswords, and making alliances against her.</b> &ndash;\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Overall, I think this book is great\nto show us just how smart Dany is: she seeks different sources of information\nin Astapor, listens to Ser Barristan&rsquo;s lessons in military matters, makes\nbrilliant plans that minimize bloodshed, knows her men and how to use each of\nthem, and punishes rapists and murderers in her army after the sack of Meereen.\nBut this book also strips Dany of her initial naivety, and she realizes that\nconquering and ruling are not the same thing. She realizes that she needs\nexperience. And we see, once again, one of Dany&rsquo;s greatest qualities: her\nself-reflection and willingness to learn. She decides to stay, learn how to be\na ruler and take responsibility for her actions.</p><p><b>A DANCE WITH DRAGONS</b></p><p>ASOS\nis, in my opinion, the book in which Dany makes the most mistakes, leading to\nthe consequences that I already described. But I also think that we shouldn&rsquo;t\nlook at her mistakes in ASOS and say that this means that Dany is an awful\nruler. Because it&rsquo;s more than understandable why she makes these mistakes. She\nhas no education or experience. It would be unrealistic if she knew everything\nshe had to do from the start.</p><p>So\nin ADWD, Dany has to deal with the mistakes she has already made, because she\ncan&rsquo;t unmake them, she can&rsquo;t go back in time to fix them. She also has to deal\nwith a lot of situations that are completely out of her control. In my opinion,\nwhile Dany made big mistakes in Astapor and Yunkai, she dealt very well with\nthe situation in Meereen, considering her circumstances. So let&rsquo;s dive into it.\nMeereen&rsquo;s storyline is very complex, so I&rsquo;ll deal with different aspects of it\nin different sections.</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b><br /></li></ul><p>People\ncriticize Daenerys for several things: because &ldquo;she destroyed the economy&rdquo;,\nbecause &ldquo;she should have a plan before she took the city to stop the economy\nfrom collapsing&rdquo; and &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t do anything to establish a new economy without\nslavery&rdquo;. So let&rsquo;s address these criticisms.</p><p><b>&ldquo;She destroyed the\neconomy&rdquo;</b></p><p>Let&rsquo;s\nlook at everything we know about Meereen&rsquo;s economy:</p><p>Their\nmain export are slaves. Astapor produces soldiers, Yunkai produces bed slaves,\nand Meereen produces bedslaves, teachers and artisans.</p><p>Aside\nfrom slaves, Meereen also has olives, salt, wine and copper. In the\nhinterlands, slaves grow wheat and olives, herd sheep and goats, and mine salt\nand copper. But even though Meereen produces other things beyond slaves, they\nare not enough to sustain the economy, and Meereen&rsquo;s economy is based mostly on\nslavery:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Without\nslaves,&nbsp;Meereen&nbsp;had little to offer traders. </i></b><i>&ndash; Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>When\nDany ends slavery, this means that she no longer has slaves to sell. And the\nslavers burnt the olive trees and the best grape arbors before Dany came into\nthe city to stop her from building siege weapons. Copper is not a very valuable\nmetal and Meereen&rsquo;s wine is of an inferior vintage.</p><p>These\nthings aren&rsquo;t Dany&rsquo;s fault. Meereen didn&rsquo;t have a lot of things to trade aside\nfrom slaves, and she couldn&rsquo;t stop the masters from burning the olive trees and\nthe grape arbors. This means that Meereen&rsquo;s economy was already very poor (it was rich because of slavery, but poor in other things) before Dany even conquered the city.</p><p>And\nthere&rsquo;s also the fact that Dany is not the kind of person to leave her people\nbehind, so she lets the former slaves from Astapor and Yunkai come with her,\nwhich also means that she has more mouths to feed.</p><p>If\nDaenerys wants to end slavery, there&rsquo;s nothing she can do about the fact that\nthe economy will suffer if she no longer has slaves to sell. </p><p>There\nare also some problems that came with Dany&rsquo;s mistakes in Yunkai and Astapor.\nThe fact that Dany didn&rsquo;t take the masters out of power in Yunkai meant that,\nas soon as Dany left, they reenslaved people, and decided to attack Dany in\nMeereen, putting her city under siege. The Yunkish army surrounded her city\nfrom land, and Qartheen ships closed the bay, so she can&rsquo;t get trade, and\nfishers can&rsquo;t go into the bay. This is partly because of Dany&rsquo;s mistakes,\nbecause she left the masters of Yunkai in power. But as I&rsquo;ve said, Dany can&rsquo;t\ngo back in time to fix those mistakes, she can only deal with the consequences. And Dany would have to face opposition no\nmatter what she did. The powers of Essos would not simply accept Dany freeing\ntheir slaves and ruining their economy, and Dany also poses a symbolical\nthreat. So most likely, the economy of the city would suffer because of the war\nagainst the slavers, no matter what Dany did.</p><p>Ending\nslavery means disrupting the economy, there&rsquo;s no way around it.</p><p><b>&ldquo;She should have a plan\nbefore she took the city to stop the economy from collapsing&rdquo;</b></p><p>I&rsquo;ve\nseen people suggest that Dany should have ended slavery gradually, or that she\nshould have waited to end slavery, so that she could first build a new economy,\nand only later free the slaves. But there are practical and ethical problems\nwith these suggestions.</p><p>Dany\nused the help of the slaves to take the city. While Dany was trying to take the\ncity from the outside, the slaves rose in revolt from the inside. Dany even\nsends part of her men to strike off the chains of the slaves in the fighting\npits. After taking the city with their help, Dany can&rsquo;t just tell the slaves\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to free you because of the economy, so you will have to wait&rdquo;.\nIf she did that, she would turn the slaves against her, and she would have both\nslaves and slavers trying to overthrow her. And if she did wait to free the\nslaves, she would probably have to compromise more with the slavers to be able\nto rule, and this would make it impossible for her to free the slaves later.</p><p>Besides,\n&ldquo;ending slavery gradually&rdquo; is just inhumane. Take into consideration that every\nday, slaves are being raped, tortured, mutilated and overworked. If you think\nthat Daenerys should have ended slavery gradually, so that she could preserve\nthe economy and end slavery &ldquo;peacefully&rdquo;, that only means that you care more\nabout the lives of the slavers and their livelihood than you care about the\nslaves.</p><p><b>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t do anything\nto establish a new economy without slavery&rdquo;</b></p><p>Another\nbaseless accusation. Dany does a lot to rebuild Meereen&rsquo;s economy. She plants\nbeans, grapes, olives and wheat. She sends her khalasar to conquer the\nhinterlands and free the slaves there, and these former slaves are also\nplanting and bringing their crops to Meereen. The Green Grace had told Dany\nthat the soil of Meereen became infertile after the wars with the Valyrians, so\nshe starts to build a ditch to bring water to the plantations, showing how Dany\nis resourceful and how she is thinking in the long term, working on the\ninfrastructure of the city to make it agriculturally independent. She also\nsends Daario to Lhazar, to reopen the overland trade routes and bring grains\ninto the city. She negotiates with Xaro, hoping to trade the few things that Meereen\nhas to offer. And when the city is put under siege, Dany compromises and\nmarries Hizdahr, so that the siege can be lifted and she can have trade again.\nShe also has to deal with things like guilds of artisans, that don&rsquo;t want to\nallow freedmen into their business, so Dany has to demand that they open their\nrolls to the freedmen.</p><p>But\neven all of those things are not enough, because some things are simply\nimpossible. She can&rsquo;t make crops grow overnight and she doesn&rsquo;t have magical\nwagons to fly over the siege lines and deliver trade into her city. No matter\nhow good a ruler is, these things are just not possible. Rebuilding an economy\nafter ending slavery is extremely difficult and takes a long time, and GRRM\nwrote a very realistic story with Daenerys. You can&rsquo;t expect everything to be\nperfect after only a few months of Daenerys ruling. But her efforts here show\nthat she&rsquo;s a good and responsible ruler, and did everything she could to\nrebuild Meeren&rsquo;s economy.</p><ul><li><b>The war against Yunkai and the question of peace and war</b><br /></li></ul><p>When\nDany conquers Meereen, she has seen the destruction that the war caused. Her\npeople are starving, and she has learned that she won&rsquo;t make things right just\nby freeing slaves and moving on from place to place. To make matters worse, she\nhas to deal with the terrorist organization The Sons of the Harpy, that are\nkilling freedmen, and even started killing her own soldiers. So it&rsquo;s no\nsurprise that with all of the slaughter and bloodshed, she wants peace more\nthan anything.</p><p>So\nDany starts making compromises with the slavers. These compromises involve\ndifferent things: she needs to marry Hizdahr, a powerful men who comes from one\nof the Great Master&rsquo;s families; she has to give indemnity in gold and gemstones to the slavers of Yunkai, as a compensation for disrupting the slave trade;\nshe has to allow slavery to return outside Meereen; she has to reopen the\nfighting pits; and she has to allow slavers from outside to bring their slaves into Meereen.</p><p>Many people accuse Dany of being\nstupid and naive for believing in Hizdahr and the peace, and not seeing that\nHizdahr is probably allied with the Sons of the Harpy. But this criticism is\nunfounded, because Dany does see that he&rsquo;s probably one of them:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; Dany studied his eyes. <b>&ldquo;Why should the Sons of the Harpy lay\ndown their knives for you? Are you one of them?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Would you tell me if you\nwere?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>He laughed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; - Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany makes these compromises not\nbecause she&rsquo;s naive, but because at her core, she is someone who doesn&rsquo;t like\nwar and conflicts. But there\nare also practical reasons: after chaining her dragons, Dany doesn&rsquo;t have\nenough military power to defy the masters. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Dany just\nmeekly accepts anything. She insists on the freedom of the people in Meereen,\nshe insists in certain rules for the fighting pits (like not allowing children,\nslaves, and not allowing thieves and debtors to be forced to fight), she\ndemands that the guilds of Meereen allow freedmen, and she trains her own\nsoldier companies, because she wants to be prepared to defend her city:</p><blockquote><p><i>He&nbsp;was&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;in\nthat, she hoped. The freedmen had been a rabble once, but <b>she had organized the men of fighting age into companies and commanded\nGrey Worm to make them into soldiers.</b> &ndash; Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso has Ser Barristan training some boys to be knights.</p><p>With\nthese actions, Dany achieves a shaky peace with Yunkai, and she gets the Sons\nof the Harpy to stop attacking. She prepares her city in the case of a war. She\nalso manages to make her conditions on who fights in the pits, and to make\nchanges in the laws of Meereen, like in the case of the guilds. I think it&rsquo;s\nimportant to acknowledge that Dany&rsquo;s course of action in Meereen was a sensible\none, and she did achieve some small victories.</p><p>But\nthis plot isn&rsquo;t just about seeing just how much Dany can accomplish as a ruler.\nIt&rsquo;s also meant for her to reflect and learn about what peace and war mean. She\nstarts the books as someone who was appalled by the costs of war, and tries\neverything she can to get peace. But as time goes, she realizes that her\nmerciful path has also caused problems. One example is when she reflects about\ncertain mistakes that she made, like leaving the slave masters in power:</p><blockquote><p><i>She had not forgotten\nthe slave children the&nbsp;Great&nbsp;Masters&nbsp;had nailed up along the\nroad from&nbsp;Yunkai. They had numbered one hundred sixty-three, a child every\nmile, nailed to mileposts with one arm outstretched to point her way. After\nMeereen had fallen, Dany had nailed up a like number\nof&nbsp;Great&nbsp;Masters. Swarms of flies had attended their slow dying, and\nthe stench had lingered long in the plaza. <b>Yet\nsome days she feared that she had not gone far enough. These Meereenese were a\nsly and stubborn people who resisted her at every turn. They had freed their\nslaves, yes &hellip; only to hire them back as servants at wages so meagre that most\ncould scarce afford to eat.</b> Those too old or young to be of use had been\ncast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled. And still\nthe&nbsp;Great&nbsp;Masters&nbsp;gathered atop their lofty pyramids to complain\nof how the dragon queen had filled their noble city with hordes of unwashed\nbeggars, thieves, and whores. &ndash; Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nstarts to question the costs of peace as well:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;There may be another choice. <b>The Yunkai'i can be persuaded to allow all your freedmen to remain\nfree, I believe, if Your Worship will agree that the Yellow City may trade and\ntrain slaves unmolested from this day forth. No more blood need flow.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Save&nbsp;for the blood of\nthose slaves that the Yunkai'i will trade and train,&rdquo;</i></b><i> Dany said, but she recognized the truth in his words even\nso. It may be that is the best end we can hope for. &ndash; Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;His Grace is\ndreaming, but <b>I cannot sleep. On the\nmorrow I must bathe in&nbsp;blood. The price of peace.</b>&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys\nVIII</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The Brazen Beasts did as they were bid. Dany watched them at\ntheir work. <b>&ldquo;Those bearers were\nslaves before I came. I made them free. Yet that palanquin is no lighter.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Hizdahr, &ldquo;but those men\nare&nbsp;paid&nbsp;to&nbsp;bear&nbsp;its weight now. Before you came, that man\nwho fell would have an overseer standing over him, stripping the skin off his\nback with a whip. Instead he is being given aid.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>It was true. A Brazen Beast in a boar mask had offered the\nlitter bearer a skin of water. <b>&ldquo;I\nsuppose I must be thankful for small victories,&rdquo;</b> the queen said. &ndash;\nDaenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>They\nstamped their feet and slapped their bellies and shouted, &ldquo;Mhysa, Mhysa,\nMhysa,&rdquo; </i></b><i>until\nthe whole pit seemed to tremble. Dany let the sound wash over her. <b>I am not&nbsp;your&nbsp;mother, she might\nhave shouted, back, I am the&nbsp;mother&nbsp;of&nbsp;your&nbsp;slaves, of\nevery boy who ever died upon these sands whilst you gorged on honeyed locusts.</b>\n&ndash; Daenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso realizes that this peace isn&rsquo;t truly sustainable, because she&rsquo;s in the\nhands of the slavers:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany scarce touched a bite. <b>This is peace, she told herself. This is what I wanted, what I worked\nfor, this is why I married Hizdahr. So why does it taste so much like defeat?</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It is only for a little while more, my love,&rdquo;\nHizdahr had assured her. &ldquo;The Yunkai'i will soon be gone, and their allies\nand hirelings with them. We shall have all we desired. Peace, food,&nbsp;trade.\nOur port is open once again, and ships are being permitted to come and\ngo.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;They are permitting that,\nyes,&rdquo; she had replied, &ldquo;but their warships remain. They can close\ntheir fingers around our throat again whenever they wish.</i></b><i> They have opened a slave market within sight of my\nwalls!&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany (rightfully) distrusts the peace, and tries to prepare herself for an eventual attack, by\nusing her wits to make the sellswords change sides once again:</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she thought, you are too honest and too honorable.\n&ldquo;If not, the Yunkai'i employ three other companies.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Rogues and cutthroats, scum of a hundred\nbattlefields,&rdquo; Ser Barristan warned, &ldquo;with captains full as\ntreacherous as&nbsp;Plumm.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I am only a young girl and\nknow little of such things, but it seems to me that we want them to be\ntreacherous.

We still have them in cells, do we not?\nUse them.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Free them, you\nmean? Is that wise? They were sent here to worm their way into your trust, so\nthey might betray Your Grace at the first chance.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Then\nthey failed. I do not trust them. I will never trust them.&rdquo; If truth be\ntold, Dany was forgetting how to trust. &ldquo;We can still use them. One was a\nwoman. Meris. Send her back, as a &hellip; a gesture of my regard. If their captain is\na clever man, he will understand.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;The woman is the\nworst of all.&rdquo;</i><i></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;All the better.&rdquo; Dany\nconsidered a moment. &ldquo;We should sound out the Long Lances too. And the\nCompany of the Cat.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Bloodbeard.&rdquo; Ser Barristan&rsquo;s frown deepened.\n&ldquo;If it please Your Grace, we want no part of him. Your Grace is too young\nto remember the Ninepenny Kings, but this&nbsp;Bloodbeard&nbsp;is cut from the\nsame savage cloth. There is no honor in him, only hunger &hellip; for gold, for glory,\nfor blood.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You know more of\nsuch men than me, ser.&rdquo; If Bloodbeard might be truly the most dishonorable\nand greedy of the sellswords, he might be the easiest to sway, but she was\nloath to go against Ser Barristan&rsquo;s counsel in such matters. <b>&ldquo;Do as you think best. But do it soon.\nIf Hizdahr&rsquo;s peace should break, I want to be ready. I do not trust the\nslavers.&rdquo; I do not trust my husband. &ldquo;They will turn on us at the\nfirst sign of weakness.&rdquo;</b></i><b><i></i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Yunkai'i grow weaker as well. The bloody flux has\ntaken hold amongst the Tolosi, it is said, and spread across the river to the\nthird Ghiscari legion.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The pale mare. Daenerys sighed. Quaithe warned me of the\npale mare&rsquo;s coming. She told me of the Dornish prince as well, the sun&rsquo;s son.\nShe told me much and more, but all in riddles. <b>&ldquo;I cannot rely on plague to save me from my enemies. Set\nPretty&nbsp;Meris&nbsp;free. At once.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nstarts to see that peace is not ideal like she had thought. And she starts to\nreflect if this peace is really worth it, and comes to the conclusion that it\nisn&rsquo;t:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;One will die, or the other will,&rdquo; said Dany.\n&ldquo;And the one who lives will die some other day. <b>This was a&nbsp;mistake.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Strong Belwas ate too many locusts.&rdquo; There was a\nqueasy look on Belwas&rsquo;s broad brown face. &ldquo;Strong Belwas needs milk.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Hizdahr ignored the\neunuch. &ldquo;Magnificence, the people of Meereen have come to celebrate our\nunion. You heard them cheering you. Do not cast away their love.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It\nwas my floppy ears they cheered, not me. Take me from this abbatoir,\nhusband.&rdquo;</i></b><i>\n&ndash; Daenerys IX ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This\nis as much about Dany reclaiming her identity as it is about her changing her\npolitical views. A peace that means that she has to give indemnity to slavers,\nwatch people fight to death, and let slavery continue is no true peace, because\nthousands and thousands of people will continue suffering the violence of\nslavery. And Dany doesn&rsquo;t want to be the kind of ruler that stands by while\ninjustice happens. So by the end of ADWD, she finally accepts fire and blood,\nwhich is necessary if she wants to end slavery once and for all.</p><p>I\nthink these reflections are necessary for Dany&rsquo;s learning. She needs\nto know when compromises are worth or not. She needs to learn how to be more\ndecisive to achieve the goals she has of social change. She needs to learn when\nto seek peace, and when to use Fire and Blood.</p><ul><li><b>The question of taking the wealth of the slave masters</b><br /></li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ve\nseen many people in the fandom saying that Dany should have taken the wealth of\nthe slavers. I agree with that. If Dany had taken their wealth, they would no\nlonger be able to finance an opposition against her. She could redistribute\ntheir wealth to the former slaves, helping to minimize inequality, and she\ncould have used it to buy sellswords to fight for her. This way, she wouldn&rsquo;t\nhave to compromise as much as she did. On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t think this\nwould solve all of her problems. Because, as I said, the economy was mostly\nbased on slavery. It would still take time to rebuild the economy and base it\non something else. It would take time for Meereen to become agriculturally\nindependent and for Meereen to start producing new products for trade.</p><p>And\nit&rsquo;s understandable why Dany doesn&rsquo;t do this. First, because she has no\nexperience, and she needs to learn. It would make no sense to write a story\nabout Dany learning if she already knows everything she has to do from the\nstart. Also, because, as pointed out in the previous sections, Dany is trying\nto be moderate and conciliatory. And as someone who is highborn, Dany doesn&rsquo;t\nreally believe in the idea of depriving the nobility of what they possess, even\nif she&rsquo;s siding with the oppressed. Taking the nobility&rsquo;s wealth is something\nthat is very against everything Dany has been taught her entire life. So at the\nbeginning of the story, Dany doesn&rsquo;t want to be too radical. But that doesn&rsquo;t\nmean she&rsquo;s not smart and doesn&rsquo;t think about it. This is actually something\nthat Dany herself does, even though she doesn&rsquo;t do it enough:</p><blockquote><p><i>That brought a smile to the Shavepate&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It will\nbe done,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but Your Radiance should know that the Great\nMasters of Zhak and Merreq are making preparations to quit their pyramids and\nleave the city.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Daenerys was sick unto death of Zhak and Merreq; she was\nsick of all the Mereenese, great and small alike. <b>&ldquo;Let them go, but see that they take no more than the clothes upon\ntheir backs. Make certain that all their&nbsp;gold&nbsp;remains here with us.\nTheir stores of food as well.&rdquo; </b>&ndash; Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\nlater, Daario too suggests it to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;You are fighting shadows when you should be fighting\nthe men who cast them,&rdquo; Daario went on. <b>&ldquo;Kill them all and take their treasures, I say.</b> Whisper the\ncommand, and your Daario will make you a pile of their heads taller than\nthis&nbsp;pyramid.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If I knew who they were&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Zhak and Pahl and\nMerreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He is as bold as he is\nbloody. &ldquo;We have no proof this is their work. Would you have me slaughter\nmy own subjects?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis reluctant. She&rsquo;s smart enough to realize that she needs to take the wealth of the masters, but she&rsquo;s not\nwilling to go too far (and she&rsquo;s even less willing to accept Daario&rsquo;s violent idea). But if the ending of ADWD is any indication, Dany has changed her stance, and won&rsquo;t be indecisive anymore.</p><ul><li><b>Conflicting interests within the city</b><br /></li></ul><p>Even\nthough I think the compromises and the peace were a mistake, I think it&rsquo;s\npointless to look at what Dany should have done. We need to look at what she\ndecided to do. Dany decided to strive for peace, so I think that we should look\nat how she worked to achieve that.</p><p>At the start of Dany&rsquo;s reign, slaves\nand slavers want different things, and there are many problems that arose with\nthe sack: the slavers want punishment for the crimes during the sack, and the\nslaves want the masters punished for their past crimes against them. In face of\nthis, Dany chooses conciliation, pardoning the crimes during the sack and the\ncrimes the slavers committed before she took the city, not only out of\nclemency, but also out of pragmatism:</p><blockquote><p><i>A former slave came, to\naccuse a certain noble of the Zhak. The man had recently taken to wife a\nfreedwoman who had been the noble&rsquo;s bedwarmer before the&nbsp;city&nbsp;fell.\nThe noble had taken her maidenhood, used her for his pleasure, and gotten her with\nchild. Her new husband wanted the noble gelded for the crime of rape, and he\nwanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble&rsquo;s bastard as\nhis own. Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding. <b>&ldquo;When he lay with her, your wife was his property, to do with as\nhe would. By law, there was no rape.&rdquo; Her decision did not please him, she\ncould see, but if she gelded every man who ever forced a bedslave, she would\nsoon rule a&nbsp;city&nbsp;of&nbsp;eunuchs.</b></i><b><i></i></b></p><p><i>A boy came, younger than Dany, slight and scarred, dressed\nup in a frayed grey tokar trailing silver fringe. His voice broke when he told\nof how two of his father&rsquo;s household slaves had risen up the night the gate\nbroke. One had slain his father, the other his elder brother. Both had raped\nhis mother before killing her as well. The boy had escaped with no more than\nthe scar upon his face, but one of the murderers was still living in his\nfather&rsquo;s house, and the other had joined the queen&rsquo;s soldiers as one of the\nMother&rsquo;s Men. He wanted them both hanged.</i></p><p><b><i>I am queen over a city built on dust\nand death.</i></b><i> <b>Dany had no choice but to deny him. She had declared\na&nbsp;blanket&nbsp;pardon&nbsp;for all crimes committed during the sack. Nor\nwould she punish slaves for rising up against their masters.</b> &ndash; </i>Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>After the sack of Meereen, Dany had\npunished rapists and murderers amongst her own soldiers:</p><blockquote><p><b>She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists their manhood. </b>Eight killers swung from the walls, and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms, but Meereen was calm again. - Daenerys VI ASOS<br /></p></blockquote><p>But in Meereen, she\ncan&rsquo;t control what the slaves do while rising against their masters, and\npunishing crimes committed during the sack would be impractical and give rise\nto lots of conflicts and anger from the former slaves against her. Similarly,\npunishing the former masters would be impractical as well. This decision shows\nDany&rsquo;s pragmatism, and it was important for keeping some semblance of peace in\nMeereen.</p><p>She also rules that a rich woman\nthat lost her house cannot have it back, but that she can have back her jewels\nand clothes. I&rsquo;ve seen many people criticize Dany for it, but the intention was\nclear and consistent with Dany&rsquo;s intentions in Meereen. Dany tries to be conciliatory,\ngranting the woman her clothes and jewels, but denying her the house, because\nthe alternative would mean that the former slaves occupying the house would be\nhomeless.</p><p>Another instance in which we can see\nDany being conciliatory is how she treats the problem of the guilds of artisans\nin Meereen:</p><blockquote><p><i>Her sleepless night soon made itself felt. Before long she\nwas fighting off a yawn as Reznak prattled about the craftsmen's&nbsp;guilds.\nThe stonemasons were wroth with her, it seemed. The bricklayers as well. Certain\nformer slaves were carving stone and laying bricks, stealing work\nfrom&nbsp;guild&nbsp;journeymen and masters alike. &ldquo;The freedmen work too\ncheaply, Magnificence,&rdquo; Reznak said. &ldquo;Some call themselves\njourneymen, or even masters, titles that belong by rights only to the craftsmen\nof the&nbsp;guilds. The masons and the bricklayers do respectfully petition\nYour Worship to uphold their ancient rights and customs.&rdquo;<b></b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;The freedmen work cheaply\nbecause they are hungry,&rdquo; Dany pointed out. &ldquo;If I forbid them to\ncarve stone or lay bricks, the chandlers, the weavers, and the goldsmiths will\nsoon be at my gates asking that they be excluded from those trades as\nwell.&rdquo; She considered a moment. &ldquo;Let it be written that henceforth\nonly guild members shall be permitted to name themselves journeymen or masters\n&hellip; provided the guilds open their rolls to any freedman who can demonstrate the\nrequisite skills.&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany manages to partially pacify the\nguild members, saying that only them could name themselves journeymen or masters, while also keeping the freedmen in their trades and demanding\nthat they have a place in the guilds.</p><p>To keep the peace, Dany also adapts\nto Meereenese culture and traditions. She speaks their language:</p><blockquote><p><i>A small, damp man, he smelled as if he had bathed in perfume\nand <b>spoke a bastard form of High\nValyrian, much corrupted and flavored with a thick Ghiscari growl.</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You are kind to say so,&rdquo;\nDany answered, in the same&nbsp;tongue.</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys\nI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She wears the tokar, even though she\nunderstands what the garment symbolizes:</p><blockquote><p><i>Even wound properly, the&nbsp;tokar required its wearer to\nhold it in place with the left hand. Walking in a&nbsp;tokar&nbsp;demanded\nsmall, mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy\ntrailing fringes. <b>It was not a garment\nmeant for any man who had to work. The&nbsp;tokar&nbsp;was a master&rsquo;s garment,\na sign of wealth and power.</b></i></p><p><b><i>Dany had wanted to ban the tokar\nwhen she took Meereen, but her advisors had convinced her otherwise. </i></b><i>&ldquo;The Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever\nhated,&rdquo; warned the Green Grace, Galazza Galare. &ldquo;In the wools of\nWesteros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall forever remain a\nstranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conqueror. Meereen&rsquo;s\nqueen must be a lady of Old Ghis.&rdquo; Brown Ben Plumm, the captain of the\nSecond Sons, had put it more succinctly. <b>&ldquo;Man\nwants to be the king o&rsquo; the rabbits, he best wear a pair o&rsquo; floppy ears.&rdquo; </b>&ndash;\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This shows that Dany understands\nboth pros and cons of wearing the tokar. She understands that the garment is a\nsymbol of power. But as someone who&rsquo;s seeking peace, Dany chooses to wear it to\nbe conciliatory.</p><p>Another thing that she does is\nfollow the Meereenese marriage rites and religion, but with one exception:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Magnificence, you\ndo not understand,&rdquo; protested Reznak. <b>&ldquo;The&nbsp;washing&nbsp;of\nthe&nbsp;feet&nbsp;is hallowed by tradition. It signifies that you shall be\nyour husband&rsquo;s handmaid.</b> The wedding garb is fraught with meaning too. The\nbride is dressed in dark red veils above a tokar of white silk, fringed with\nbaby pearls.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>A bride price paid in\nblood. Daenerys was weary of fighting this battle. Even Ser Barristan did not\nthink she could win. &ldquo;No ruler can make a people good,&rdquo; Selmy had\ntold her. &ldquo;Baelor the Blessed prayed and fasted and built the Seven as\nsplendid a temple as any gods could wish for, yet he could not put an end to\nwar and want.&rdquo; A queen must listen to her people, Dany reminded herself.\n&ldquo;After the wedding Hizdahr will be king. Let him reopen the fighting pits\nif he wishes. I want no part of it.&rdquo; Let the blood be on his hands, not\nmine. She rose. &ldquo;<b>If my husband\nwishes me to&nbsp;wash&nbsp;his&nbsp;feet, he must first&nbsp;wash&nbsp;mine.</b>\nI will tell him so this evening.&rdquo; She wondered how her betrothed would\ntake that. &ndash; Daenerys VI ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Dany understands that for the peace,\nshe must follow Meereenese traditions. But she also understands that as a woman\nin power, she can&rsquo;t afford to be seen as weak, so she can&rsquo;t be seen as &ldquo;her\nhusband&rsquo;s handmaid&rdquo;. Once again, Dany tries a conciliatory solution.</p><p>Courtesy is also important in\nkeeping the peace, and Dany does her best to be courteous even when she doesn&rsquo;t\nlike something:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the afternoon a\nsculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the\nPlaza of Purification with one cast in Dany&rsquo;s image. <b>She denied him with as much courtesy as she could muster.</b> A pike of\nunprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished\nto give it to the queen. <b>She admired the\nfish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, and sent the\npike to her kitchens.</b> A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished\nrings to wear to war. <b>She accepted it\nwith fulsome&nbsp;thanks;</b> it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished\ncopper would flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she\nwould sooner be clad in steel. Even a young girl who knew nothing of the ways\nof war knew that. &ndash; Daenerys I ADWD</i><i></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your Grace need only ask him. The noble Hizdahr awaits below. Send down to him if that is your pleasure.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>You presume too much, priestess, the queen thought, but she swallowed her anger and made herself smile.</i></b><i> &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; She sent for Ser Barristan and told the old knight to bring Hizdahr to her. <b>&ldquo;It is a long climb. Have the Unsullied help him up.&rdquo; </b>&ndash; Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>He will be safer as a\nhostage. <b>My captain was not made\nfor&nbsp;peace. Dany could not risk his cutting down Brown Ben Plumm, making\nmock of Hizdahr before the court, provoking the Yunkai'i, or otherwise\nupsetting the agreement that she had given up so much to win.</b> Daario was\nwar and woe. Henceforth, she must keep him out of her bed, out of her heart,\nand out of her. If he did not betray her, he would master her. She did not know\nwhich of those she feared the most. &ndash; VIII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nisn&rsquo;t always perfect. When dealing with Quentyn, she laughs at his story but\nforgets to explain the reason for her laugh in his language. But even though\nshe slips, Dany still makes an effort to be courteous with him:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo;\nDaenerys said. &ldquo;Prince Quentyn has crossed half the world to offer me his\ngift, I will not have him treated with discourtesy.&rdquo;</i></b><i> She turned to the Dornishmen.\n&ldquo;Would that you had come a year ago. I am pledged to wed the noble Hizdahr\nzo Loraq.&rdquo; - Daenerys VII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\nlater, because of Dany&rsquo;s courtesy and kindness, he comes to like her and\nrespect her:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Daenerys&nbsp;never&nbsp;laughed.\nThe rest of Meereen might see him as an amusing curiosity,</i></b><i> like the exiled Summer Islander King\nRobert used to keep at King&rsquo;s Landing, <b>but\nthe queen had always spoken to him gently.</b> &ndash; The Spurned Suitor ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>All\nof this shows that Dany is good enough at her courtesies, even if she sometimes\nslips.</p><p>Finally,\nDany is not petty and does not treat people with brutality, even when they\noffend her, and that&rsquo;s very important, because she needs to avoid being hated\n(some people will hate her regardless of what she does, because she goes\nagainst their interests, but it&rsquo;s important that Dany shows herself to be a\nmerciful queen):</p><blockquote><p><b><i>When\nshe told him, the boy rushed at her,</i></b><i> but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went\nsprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The\nhuge brown eunuch yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a\nrat. <b>&ldquo;Enough, Belwas,&rdquo; Dany called.\n&ldquo;Release him.&rdquo; To the boy she said, &ldquo;Treasure that tokar, for it\nsaved your life. You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here. You\nshould do the same.&rdquo;</b> But as he left the boy looked back over his\nshoulder, and when she saw his eyes Dany thought, The Harpy has another Son. -\nDaenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;We are all dead,\nthen. You gave us death, not freedom.&rdquo; <b>Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face.</b></i></p><p><i>Strong Belwas seized\nhim by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard\nGhael&rsquo;s teeth crack. The Shavepate would have done worse, but she stopped him.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo;\nshe said, dabbing at her cheek with the end of her tokar. &ldquo;No one has ever\ndied from spittle. Take him away.&rdquo; </i></b><i>- Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>With all of that, I think Dany actually\ndid a very good job to keep the peace. She is conciliatory, courteous, seeks\npeaceful solutions, while also trying to gain small victories for the freedmen.\nShe usually tries to find a middle ground. While I do think the peace was a\nmistake, I think this period in Dany&rsquo;s story was important for her to learn.</p><ul><li><b>Morality</b><br /></li></ul><p>Dany\nis a very kind person who strives to do good, but there are also moments in\nwhich she gets angered over the injustice that she witnesses. Dany didn&rsquo;t grow\nup with anyone to teach her about honor and justice, only Viserys. So this\nmeans that she sometimes makes mistakes and takes cruel actions.</p><p>The\nfirst we see is, of course, the crucifixions of 163 slave masters in punishment\nfor crucifying children. I see many people say that Dany doesn&rsquo;t care about\njustice, and that this action proves it, because she supposedly crucified\npeople without caring about guilt and innocence. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is\nexactly true. First, because Dany does not crucify random people. She asks for\nthe leaders of Meereen (Meereen is ruled by a council of masters), the ones most likely to be responsible for the children&rsquo;s\ndeaths.</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;I\nwant your&nbsp;leaders,&rdquo; Dany told them. &ldquo;Give them up, and the rest of you\nshall be spared.&rdquo;</i></b><i>&nbsp;&ndash;\nDaenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s\ntrue that this is still an eye for an eye, and it&rsquo;s still a cruel punishment.\nBut Dany does start to feel bad for the action, even if she still believes it\nto be justice:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany remembered the horror she had felt when she had seen\nthe Plaza of Punishment in Astapor. <b>I\nmade a horror just as great, but surely they deserved it. Harsh justice is\nstill justice.</b> &ndash; Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>But\nlater in the books, Dany shows herself to care about innocence and guilt:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;You are fighting shadows when you should be fighting\nthe men who cast them,&rdquo; Daario went on. &ldquo;Kill them all and take their\ntreasures, I say. Whisper the command, and your Daario will make you a pile of\ntheir heads taller than this&nbsp;pyramid.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If I knew who they were&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Zhak and Pahl and\nMerreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great Masters. Who else would it be?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>He\nis as bold as he is bloody. &ldquo;We have no proof this is their work. Would\nyou have me slaughter my own subjects?&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;This we have heard. And yet <b>Your Radiance has found the courage to answer butchery with mercy. You\nhave not harmed any of the noble children you hold as hostage.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;These\nmurders are not their doing,&rdquo; Dany told the Green Grace, feebly. &ldquo;I\nam no butcher queen.&rdquo;</i></b><i>\n&ndash; Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Another\ncontroversial action that Dany takes is the torture of the wineseller\ndaughters. This is obviously wrong, but I need to point out that torture is\nconsidered a valid method of interrogation in this world. The Night&rsquo;s Watch\ndoes it, Jon considers throwing Janos Slynt in an ice cell to force him to\ncomply and later puts Cregan Karstark in those cells, Jaehaerys tortures people\nto find out who murdered Rego Draz, the High Sparrow does it, the Arryns have a\ntorturer and the sky cells that serve as psychological torture&hellip; I could go on,\nbut I think I&rsquo;ve made my point. Dany is a product of her society, so she&rsquo;s not\nacting any differently from other rulers. There was circumstancial evidence\nagainst the wineseller and his daughters. But we can see that Dany does care\nabout innocence:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;It will be done, Your Worship. Would you have me\nquestion them sweetly, or sharply?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Sweetly, to begin. Hear what\ntales they tell and what names they give you. It may be they had no part in\nthis.&rdquo;</i></b><i> She hesitated. &ldquo;Nine, the\nnoble Reznak said. Who else?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nchanges her stance when she gets angered about the cruel death of Rylonna Rhee,\nand orders them to be questioned sharply. But later, Dany does learn from her\nmistakes:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;If there is a Harpy.&rdquo; Skahaz was convinced that somewhere\nin Meereen the Sons of the Harpy had a highborn overlord, a secret general\ncommanding an army of shadows. Dany did not share his belief.&nbsp;<b>The Brazen Beasts had taken dozens of the\nHarpy&rsquo;s Sons, and those who had survived their capture had yielded names when\nquestioned sharply &hellip; too many names, it seemed to her.</b>&nbsp;It would have\nbeen pleasant to think that all the deaths were the work of a single enemy who\nmight be caught and killed, but Dany suspected that the truth was otherwise. My\nenemies are legion. &ldquo;Hizdahr zo Loraq is a persuasive man with many friends.\nAnd he is wealthy. Perhaps he has bought this peace for us with gold, or\nconvinced the other highborn that our marriage is in their best interests.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If he is not the Harpy, he knows him. I can find the truth\nof that easy enough.&nbsp;<b>Give me your\nleave to put Hizdahr to the question, and I will bring you a confession.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not trust\nthese confessions. You&rsquo;ve brought me too many of them, all of them worthless.&rdquo;</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Your Radiance&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No, I said.&rdquo;</i></b><i>&nbsp;&ndash; Daenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nrealizes that torture is ineffective, and forbids it. Dany is the only ruler in\nthe books to explicitly forbid torture.</p><p>I\nthink what all of this shows is that Dany is trying very hard to be just. She\ndidn&rsquo;t grow up with a good moral example, but she strives to be better, while\nalso trying to rule. And she is willing to change her ways and learn from her\nmistakes.</p><ul><li><b>Practical aspects of ruling</b><br /></li></ul><p>Aside\nfrom trying to keep peace and bring justice, Dany also has to deal with the\ntedious aspects of ruling in Meereen. Dany is a very hands on ruler, and she\ndoesn&rsquo;t like to delegate too much:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;Your Grace takes too much on\nherself. You should allow your&nbsp;councillors&nbsp;to shoulder more of your\nburdens.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I have too many councillors\nand too few cushions.&rdquo;</i></b><i> Dany turned to Reznak. &ldquo;How\nmany more?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>While\nmaybe Dany does take too much on herself, this also means that she gets\npractice in the several aspects of the administration of a city. One of them is\nhow to get the money that she needs:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany was shocked.&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;They want to be slaves?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;The ones who come are\nwell spoken and gently born, sweet queen. Such slaves are prized. In the Free\nCities they will be tutors, scribes, bed slaves, even healers and priests. They\nwill sleep in soft beds, eat rich foods, and dwell in manses.&nbsp;Here they\nhave lost all, and live in fear and squalor.&rdquo;</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;\nPerhaps it was not so shocking, if these tales of Astapor were true. Dany\nthought a moment. &ldquo;Any man who wishes to sell himself into slavery may do\nso. Or woman.&rdquo; She raised a hand. &ldquo;But they may not sell their\nchildren, nor a man his wife.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;In\nAstapor the city took a tenth part of the price, each time a slave changed\nhands,&rdquo;</i></b><i>\nMissandei told her.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the same,&rdquo; Dany\ndecided. Wars were won with gold as much as swords.\n&ldquo;A&nbsp;tenth&nbsp;part. In gold or silver coin, or ivory. Meereen has no\nneed of saffron, cloves, or zorse hides.&rdquo; </i></b><i>&ndash; Daenerys VI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>While Dany doesn&rsquo;t like the idea of\npeople selling themselves back into slavery, she thinks she must respect their\nchoices (without allowing them to sell other people unwillingly). But,\nfollowing Missandei&rsquo;s suggestion, she takes a part of the money of those\ntransactions. She turns something that she doesn&rsquo;t like to do (allowing people\nto sell themselves), and tries to make use of it, and she knows that &ldquo;wars are\nwon with gold as much as swords&rdquo;, meaning that Dany is not stupid and knows\nthat armies are not the only source of power. (NOTE: I don&rsquo;t think Dany should\nhave allowed people to sell themselves back into slavery, because this means\nthat she&rsquo;s allowing part of the slave trade to continue, allowing that some\npeople have the right to own others like objects. But Dany decided to take a\nmoderate approach, and what I&rsquo;m analysing in this section isn&rsquo;t what she should\nhave done overall, but how she dealt with the practical aspects of the\nadministration of her city. As an administrative measure, I think that if Dany\nwas going to let people sell themselves back into slavery, then she made a\nsmart decision by taking a part of the money). Later, we see that Dany continues\nwith this. As I already mentioned, she takes the wealth of the noble families\nthat choose to leave Meereen. She also imposes a blood tax to pay the wages of\nthe Brazen Beasts:</p><blockquote><p><i>Reznak mo Reznak gasped. <b>&ldquo;Magnificence, where is the coin to come from to pay wages for so\nmany men?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;From the pyramids. Call it a\nblood&nbsp;tax. I will have a hundred pieces of gold from every pyramid for\neach freedman that the Harpy&rsquo;s Sons have slain.&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys II ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>With this tax, Dany is trying to do\ntwo things at once: to get the money to pay for the soldiers that she needs,\nand to weaken the Meereenese noble families that conspire against her. It\ndoesn&rsquo;t work, because Dany is too mild with the slavers, and takes too little\nmoney from them. But this moment shows that Dany realizes that she can use\ntaxes not only to fill the city&rsquo;s coffers, but also to have political gains,\nlike weakening her enemies. We also see other moments in which Dany uses taxes\nto get some benefit out of a situation that she doesn&rsquo;t like:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your Magnificence,&rdquo; whispered Reznak mo Reznak in\nher ear, <b>&ldquo;it is customary for the\ncity to claim one-tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after\nexpenses, as a&nbsp;tax. That coin might be put to many noble uses.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It might &hellip; though if we were\nto reopen the pits, we should take our tenth before expenses. I am only a young\ngirl and know little of such matters, but I dwelt with Xaro Xhoan Daxos long\nenough to learn that much.</i></b><i> Hizdahr, if you could marshal armies\nas you marshal arguments, you could conquer the world &hellip; but my answer is still\nno. For the sixth time.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany\nis also smart enough to know that corruption might be a problem, and she takes\nmeasures to prevent it:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;It shall be done as you command, glorious queen,&rdquo;\nsaid Daario. &ldquo;My Stormcrows will collect your tenth.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>If\nthe Stormcrows saw to the collections at least half the gold would somehow go\nastray, Dany knew.</i></b><i>\nBut the Second Sons were just as bad, and the Unsullied were as unlettered as\nthey were incorruptible. <b>&ldquo;Records\nmust be kept,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Seek among the freedmen for men who can\nread, write, and do sums.&rdquo;</b></i><i> - Daenerys\nVI ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s also another interesting\nmoment in which Dany has to deal with the possibility that people will try to\ntake advantage of her decrees:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Three-and-twenty.&rdquo; Dany sighed. <b>&ldquo;My dragons have developed a\nprodigious taste for mutton since we began to pay the shepherds for their\nkills. Have these claims been proven?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Some men have brought&nbsp;burnt&nbsp;bones.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Men\nmake fires. Men cook mutton. Burnt bones prove nothing.</i></b><i> Brown Ben says there\nare red wolves in the hills outside the city, and jackals and wild dogs. Must\nwe pay good silver for every lamb that goes astray between Yunkai and the\nSkahazadhan?&rdquo;</i><i></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, Magnificence.&rdquo; Reznak bowed. <b>&ldquo;Shall I send these rascals away, or\nwill you want them scourged?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Daenerys shifted on the bench. <b>&ldquo;No man should ever fear to come to me.&rdquo; Some claims\nwere&nbsp;false, she did not doubt, but more were genuine.</b> Her dragons had\ngrown too large to be content with rats and cats and dogs. The more they eat,\nthe larger they will grow, Ser Barristan had warned her, and the larger they\ngrow, the more they&rsquo;ll eat. Drogon especially ranged far afield and could\neasily devour a sheep a day. <b>&ldquo;Pay\nthem for the value of their animals,&rdquo; she told Reznak, &ldquo;but\nhenceforth claimants must present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and\nswear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys I ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany is smart enough to see that some people\nare deceiving her, but instead of doing what Reznak suggests, Dany knows that\nif she deals with people with brutality, they will fear ever coming to her\nagain. Instead, she uses Meereen&rsquo;s religious beliefs to dissuade people from\nmaking false claims. There are also several moments in which Dany states that\nshe wants people to come to her with their problems, and that she doesn&rsquo;t want\nthem to be afraid to speak their minds or to criticize her:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; said Whitebeard, &ldquo;the Prince of\nDragonstone was a most puissant warrior, but &hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo;</i></b><i> she urged. <b>&ldquo;You\nmay&nbsp;speak&nbsp;freely&nbsp;to me.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys I ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I say no, Your Grace,&rdquo; the old man answered at\nonce.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;<b>Speak</b>&nbsp;<b>freely</b>.&rdquo;\n&ndash; Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Whitebeard bowed his head. &ldquo;Your Grace, I did not mean\nto give offense.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Only&nbsp;lies&nbsp;offend&nbsp;me,\nnever honest counsel.&rdquo; Dany patted Arstan&rsquo;s spotted hand to reassure him.\n&ldquo;I have a dragon&rsquo;s temper, that&rsquo;s all. You must not let it frighten\nyou.&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys II ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Whitebeard,&rdquo;\nshe said, <b>&ldquo;I want your&nbsp;counsel,\nand you should never fear to speak your mind with me &hellip; when we are alone.</b>\nBut never question me in front of strangers. Is that understood?&rdquo; &ndash;\nDaenerys III ASOS</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><b>&ldquo;Then what do you&nbsp;advise, Ser Jorah?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;You will not like it.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I\nwould hear it all the same.&rdquo;</i></b><i> &ndash; Daenerys V ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Dany also has to run investigations\nto find out who the Sons of the Harpy are, and has to find ways to protect her\npeople and her soldiers from them. In the end, she doesn&rsquo;t succeed (she only succeeds after she makes the peace deals), but Dany\ndoes take some important measures. She tries what she can to ensure the safety\nof her soldiers:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&hellip; drawn in blood.&rdquo;\nDaenerys knew the way of it by now. The Sons of the Harpy did their butchery by\nnight, and over each kill they left their mark. <b>&ldquo;Grey Worm, why was this man alone? Had he no partner?&rdquo; By\nher command, when the Unsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they\nalways walked in pairs. </b>- Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>She also does what she can to\nconduct investigations:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Send men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any\nman has come to the Blue Graces with a sword wound. And spread the word that we\nwill pay good gold for the short sword of Stalwart Shield. Inquire of the\nbutchers and the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of late.&rdquo;\nPerhaps some goatherd would confess. &ldquo;Henceforth, no man of mine walks\nalone after dark.&rdquo;</b> - Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Dany has to deal with a\nplague. And for her, it&rsquo;s a lot of trial and error to try to find a solution to\nthe pale mare situation:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Daenerys\ndare not open her gates to let them in.</i></b><i> She had tried to do what she could for them. <b>She had sent them healers</b>, Blue Graces\nand spell-singers and barber-surgeons, <b>but\nsome of those had sickened as well, and none of their arts had slowed the\ngalloping progression of the flux that had come on the pale mare. Separating\nthe healthy from the&nbsp;sick&nbsp;had proved impractical as well.</b> Her\nStalwart Shields had tried, pulling husbands away from wives and children from\ntheir mothers, even as the Astapori wept and kicked and pelted them with\nstones.<b> A few days later,\nthe&nbsp;sick&nbsp;were dead and the healthy ones were&nbsp;sick. Dividing the\none from the other had accomplished nothing.</b> &ndash; Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Many shat where they slept now, too\nfeeble to crawl to the ditches she&rsquo;d commanded them to dig.</i></b><i> Two women fought over a charred bone. Nearby a boy of ten\nstood eating a rat. He ate one-handed, the other clutching a sharpened stick\nlest anyone try to wrest away his prize. Unburied dead lay everywhere. Dany saw\none man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak, but as she rode past his\ncloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women sat upon the ground\nclutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. Those who had the strength\ncalled out. &ldquo;Mother &hellip; please, Mother &hellip; bless you, Mother &hellip;&rdquo;</i><i>&nbsp;&ndash; Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;They are too feeble,&rdquo; said Symon Stripeback.</i></p><p><b><i>Dany said, &ldquo;More food might\nmake them&nbsp;stronger.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>Symon shook his head. &ldquo;Food should not be wasted on the\ndying, Your Worship. We do not have enough to feed the living.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>He was not wrong, she\nknew, but that did not make the words any easier to hear.</b> &ldquo;This is far\nenough,&rdquo; the queen decided. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll feed them here.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys\nVI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Dany gazed across the\ncamp, to the many-colored brick walls of Meereen. The air was thick with flies\nand cries. &ldquo;The gods have sent this pestilence to humble me. <b>So many dead &hellip; I will not have them\neating&nbsp;corpses.&rdquo;</b> She beckoned Aggo closer. &ldquo;Ride to the\ngates and bring me Grey Worm and fifty of his Unsullied.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys VI\nADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>By the time Aggo returned with Grey Worm and fifty of the\nUnsullied loping behind his horse, Dany had shamed all of them into helping\nher. <b>Symon Stripeback and his men were\npulling the living from the dead and stacking up the corpses, while Jhogo and\nRakharo and their Dothraki helped those who could still walk toward the shore\nto&nbsp;bathe&nbsp;and wash their clothes.</b> Aggo stared at them as if they\nhad all gone mad, but Grey Worm knelt beside the queen and said, &ldquo;This one\nwould be of help.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Before midday a dozen fires were\nburning. </i></b><i>Columns of greasy black smoke rose\nup to stain a merciless blue sky. Dany&rsquo;s riding clothes were stained and sooty\nas she stepped back from the pyres. <b>&ldquo;Worship,&rdquo;\nGrey Worm said, &ldquo;this one and his brothers beg your leave to bathe in the\nsalt sea when our work here is done, that we might be purified according to the\nlaws of our great goddess.&rdquo;</b> &ndash; Daenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>Though\nthe queen had let the Astapori starve outside her walls to keep the\nbloody&nbsp;flux&nbsp;from spreading, it was spreading nonetheless.</i></b><i> Many had been\nstricken: freedmen, sellswords, Brazen Beasts, even Dothraki, <b>though as yet none of\nthe&nbsp;Unsullied&nbsp;had been touched.</b> She prayed the worst was past. &ndash;\nDaenerys VII ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the quotes above are very\ninteresting because we can see Dany gaining experience as she tries to control\nthe situation. She tries sending healers, but they get sick. She tries\nseparating sick and healthy, but soon sees that people don&rsquo;t want to be separated\nfrom their loved ones. She tries giving them more food. She digs ditches, burn\ncorpses and helps to clean people. Those things show that Dany has some idea\nthat she needs to be careful to not spread the disease (she closes the gates),\nand at the same time, she also understands that hygiene is important. I think\nthat the observation about how the Unsullied were not touched by the plague is\nsomething that, in the future, will be useful for Dany, something that she will\nremember. In conclusion, I think these moments show just how much Dany is\ntrying to learn from the situation, how she seems to be taking note of what\nworks and what doesn&rsquo;t. I think Dany will come out of this much more prepared\nto deal with similar situations when necessary, and I think this is important\nto her growth as a ruler as well.</p><p>In my opinion, Dany has shown\nherself to be very smart and capable of dealing with the practical aspects of\nthe administration of a city.</p><ul><li><b>Dany&rsquo;s equalitarian practices</b><br /></li></ul><p>One thing that distinguishes Dany as\na ruler is how she gives power and voice to the smallfolk. She listens to them at court and\ncouncil, and gives them the same respect:</p><blockquote><p><i>Reznak would have summoned another tokar next, but\nDany insisted that he call upon a freedman. <b>Thereafter she&nbsp;alternated&nbsp;between the former masters and the\nformer slaves.</b></i> &ndash; Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Rylona Rhee had played the harp as sweetly as the\nMaiden<b>. When she had been a slave in\nYunkai, she had played for every highborn family in the city. In Meereen she\nhad become a leader amongst the Yunkish freedmen, their voice in\nDany's&nbsp;councils.</b></i> &ndash; Daenerys II ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Late that afternoon Admiral Groleo and Ser Barristan\nreturned from their inspection of the galleys. Dany assembled\nher&nbsp;council&nbsp;to hear them. <b>Grey\nWorm was there for the Unsullied</b>, Skahaz mo Kandaq for the Brazen Beasts.\nIn the absence of her bloodriders, a wizened jaqqa rhan called Rommo,\nsquint-eyed and bowlegged, came to speak for her Dothraki. <b>Her freedmen were represented by the captains of the three companies\nshe had formed&mdash;Mollono Yos Dob of the Stalwart Shields, Symon Stripeback of the\nFree Brothers, Marselen of the Mother&rsquo;s Men</b>. Reznak mo Reznak hovered at\nthe queen&rsquo;s elbow, and Strong Belwas stood behind her with his huge arms\ncrossed.</i>&nbsp;&ndash; Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><ul><li><b>Some mistakes worth addressing</b><br /></li></ul><p>One mistake that Dany makes is that\nshe takes hostages, but fails to kill them when the Sons of the Harpy attack.\nIf she wasn&rsquo;t going to kill her hostages, she shouldn&rsquo;t have taken hostages in\nthe first place. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that Dany understands her\nfailure in this situation:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany pushed her food\nabout her plate. She dare not glance over to where Grazhar and Qezza stood, for\nfear that she might cry. The Shavepate has a harder heart than mine. They had\nfought about the hostages half a dozen times. &ldquo;The Sons of the Harpy are\nlaughing in their pyramids,&rdquo; Skahaz said, just this morning. &ldquo;What\ngood are hostages if you will not take their heads?&rdquo; <b>In his eyes, she was only a weak woman.</b> Hazzea was enough. What\ngood is peace if it must be purchased with the blood of little children?\n&ldquo;These murders are not their doing,&rdquo; Dany told the Green Grace,\nfeebly. &ldquo;I am no butcher queen.&rdquo; - Daenerys IV ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s\nnot like Dany doesn&rsquo;t know she made a mistake. She knows the Shavepate sees her\nas weak, and she knows her enemies must think this as well. So I believe that\nin the future, Dany won&rsquo;t take hostages unless she intends to kill them.</p><p>There\nare also moments in which Dany is too open:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;On what\nterms?&rdquo; Beware the perfumed seneschal, Quaithe had said. The masked woman\nhad foretold the coming of the pale mare, was she right about the noble Reznak\ntoo? &ldquo;I may be a young girl innocent of war, but I am not a lamb to walk\nbleating into the harpy&rsquo;s den. I still have my Unsullied. I have the Stormcrows\nand the Second Sons. I have three companies of freedmen.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Them, and\ndragons,&rdquo; said Brown Ben Plumm, with a grin.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;In\nthe pit, in chains,&rdquo; wailed Reznak mo Reznak.</i></b><i> &ldquo;What good are\ndragons that cannot be controlled? Even the Unsullied grow fearful when they\nmust open the doors to feed them.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What, o&rsquo; the\nqueen&rsquo;s little pets?&rdquo; Brown Ben&rsquo;s eyes crinkled in amusement. The grizzled\ncaptain of the Second Sons was a creature of the free companies, a mongrel with\nthe blood of a dozen different peoples flowing through his veins, but he had\nalways been fond of the dragons, and them of him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Pets?&rdquo;\nscreeched Reznak. &ldquo;Monsters, rather. Monsters that feed on children. We\ncannot&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo;\nsaid Daenerys. &ldquo;We will not speak of that.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>Reznak shrank away from\nher, flinching from the fury in her tone. &ldquo;Forgive me, Magnificence, I did\nnot &hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>Dany sighed. <b>&ldquo;I am sorry, Ben. I dare not loose the\ndragons.&rdquo; She could see that was not the answer that he wanted.</b> -\nDaenerys V ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>In\nthis scene, we can see that Dany tries to control the information, and she\ntries to silence Reznak when he starts to speak too much. But in the end, she\nends up telling Ben that she will not use the dragons, which ends up leading to\nhim betraying her. But I think this can be seen as a slip, not a flaw in Dany\nas a ruler, because we see in several other moments that Dany is not a gullible\nperson. She distrusts Xaro and Pyat Pree in Qarth, and in Meereen, she refuses\nto tell Xaro her secrets:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Is that meant to\nfrighten me? I lived in fear for fourteen years, my lord. I woke afraid each\nmorning and went to sleep afraid each night &hellip; but my fears were burned away the\nday I came forth from the fire. Only one thing frightens me now.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;And\nwhat is it that you fear, sweet queen?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I\nam only a foolish young girl.&rdquo;</i></b><i> Dany rose on her toes and kissed his cheek. <b>&ldquo;But not so foolish as to tell you\nthat.</b> My men shall look at these ships. Then you shall have my\nanswer.&rdquo; - Daenerys III ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>She\nalso tells Hazzea&rsquo;s father that he shouldn&rsquo;t tell anyone about what happened.\nEven in the scene in which she tells Ben that she can&rsquo;t use her dragons, she\ndoes try to be cautious about the information she discloses, and she can\nrecognize her mistake with Ben Brown Plumm:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Never that,&rdquo; said Brown Ben, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not all about the\ncoin, Your High-and-Mightiness. [&hellip;] Silver&rsquo;s sweet and gold&rsquo;s our mother, but\nonce you&rsquo;re dead they&rsquo;re worth less than that last shit you take as you lie\ndying. I told you once, there are old sellswords and there are bold sellswords,\nbut there are no old bold sellswords. My boys didn&rsquo;t care to die, that&rsquo;s all,\nand when I told them that you couldn&rsquo;t unleash them dragons against the\nYunkishmen, well &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b>You saw me as defeated,\nDany thought, and who am I to say that you were wrong?</b> - Daenerys VIII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>So\nI would say this was mostly a slip. Dany is not an stupid and naive person, and\nshe can see what her mistakes were.</p><p>Another\nthing that Dany fails to do is that, as Tyrion notes, is that she doesn&rsquo;t poison the\nwell outside Meereen, which would have helped her to defeat the siege of the\nYunkai&rsquo;i. We are never told the reasons for it in Dany&rsquo;s POV, but if I could\nguess, I imagine it&rsquo;s for the same reason that Dany has been so insistent on\npeace: she knows that if she poisons the wells, she would be condemning the\nAstapori refugees to death. We still don&rsquo;t know what Dany will do next in her\nstory, but I guess it&rsquo;s understandable why Dany doesn&rsquo;t do this, because she&rsquo;s\ntrying to do the right thing.</p><p>Finally,\nwe also have this moment, in which Dany and Barristan are talking about the\nBrazen Beasts:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;A mask can hide many things, Your Grace. Is the man\nbehind the owl mask the same owl who guarded you yesterday and the day before?\nHow can we know?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;How\nshould&nbsp;Meereen&nbsp;ever come to trust the Brazen Beasts if I do not?</i></b><i> There are good brave men beneath those masks. I put my life\ninto their hands.&rdquo; Dany smiled for him. &ldquo;You fret too much, ser. I\nwill have you beside me, what other protection do I need?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys IX\nADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>There\nare pros and cons in each approach. The reason for the mask of the Brazen\nBeasts is for them to not be recognized, so they won&rsquo;t be targeted and attacked\nby the Sons of the Harpy. And from the perspective of someone that is seeking\npeace, Dany is right in saying that she can&acute;t ask Meereen to trust the Brazen\nBeasts if she doesn&acute;t.\nIt&acute;s a question of appearances: she needs to show confidence if she wants her\npeople to feel safe and\ntrust the Brazen Beasts. On the other hand, Barristan is right in saying that\nmasks can make it easier for her enemies to hide (though Dany is not completely unprotected. She still keeps people she trusts by her side, like\nBarristan and Belwas, so it&rsquo;s not like Dany is neglectful of her own safety).\nBesides, Dany has let Hizdahr appoint a cousin to the command of the Brazen\nBeasts, which is bad for her, because this could make her lose control of one\nof her more important military forces. So there are good points to be made\nin favor of Dany&rsquo;s decisions here, but also good points against her decisions.</p><p>I\nthink these mistakes show that Dany isn&rsquo;t perfect, but in no way they mean that\nDany is a bad ruler. They mean that Dany is a human being, so sometimes she\nslips, while also trying to do what&rsquo;s right. And Dany does understand some of her\nmistakes. She&rsquo;s mindful of them, which is a positive thing.</p><p><b>IS DAENERYS A GOOD RULER? WHAT DID SHE LEARN?</b></p><p>Now\nlet&rsquo;s look at Dany&rsquo;s whole journey. In AGOT, Dany learns the importance of\nculture and traditions, she learns how to be strong and assertive, and with\nJorah Mormont, she asks for information about Westeros and the Dothraki that\nher brother never bothers to ask.</p><p>In\nACOK, Dany leads her people out of the Red Waste by giving an example of\nstrength, determination, care for her people, respect for their culture,\npragmatism and by making the sensible decision to send her bloodriders to find\na way out of the desert so they don&rsquo;t have to walk blindly through the desert.\nIn Qarth, she&rsquo;s suspicious and cautious but not paranoid, she escapes\ndeceptions and temptations, and finds a new resolve.</p><p>In\nASOS, Dany makes brilliant battle plans, but also big mistakes. But she learns\nfrom her mistakes: she understands her failure in leaving Astapor behind\nwithout an army to protect it, and she understands her failure in leaving the\nmasters of Yunkai in power.</p><p>In\nADWD, Dany does everything possible to rebuild the economy (she plants crops,\nnegotiates for trade, and make compromises to lift the siege against Meereen),\nand to keep the people of Meereen free. She deals well with taxes, and does\neverything she can to stop the plague. She trains new soldier companies to\nprotect her city, and later tries to make the sellswords change sides, because\nshe know that she must be prepared if the peace breaks. She makes compromises to\nbring peace, and acts accordingly to make the peace deals work. In my opinion,\nall of this shows that Dany was a very good ruler in Meereen. She took a very sensible\ncourse of action, probably the best she could have done in the circumstances,\nbecause she didn&rsquo;t have enough military power to defeat the slavers. Her\nwillingness to make compromises shows that she is the kind of ruler who seeks\npeaceful solutions. But in the end, Dany comes to reflect on the pros and cons\nof peace, and decides that the peace wasn&rsquo;t worth it, because it was an unjust\npeace. This is important because Dany needs to know when to look for peaceful\nsolutions, and when war is necessary. Dany will certainly come out of this as a\nmore decisive and mature ruler.</p><p>Besides,\nher actions as a queen that cares about her people are bearing fruits. Her\npeople still love her and support her even in the direst times:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dany saw one man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak,\nbut as she rode past his cloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women\nsat upon the ground clutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. <b>Those who had the strength called out.\n&ldquo;Mother &hellip; please, Mother &hellip; bless you, Mother &hellip;\"&nbsp;</b></i><i>&nbsp;&ndash;\nDaenerys VI ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>Later, when Dany is gone from the\ncity, her people are still loyal to her:</p><blockquote><p><i>When His Grace had\ntried to put them under the command of a cousin, as he had the Brazen Beasts, <b>Grey Worm had informed the king that they\nwere free men who took commands only from their&nbsp;mother.</b></i>\n&ndash; The Queensguard ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\"Is it true?&rdquo; a freedwoman shouted. <b>&ldquo;Is our&nbsp;mother&nbsp;dead?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; Reznak screeched. &ldquo;Queen\nDaenerys will return to Meereen in her own time in all her might and majesty.\nUntil such time, His Worship King Hizdahr shall&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;He\nis no king of mine,&rdquo; a freedman yelled.</i></b>\n&ndash; The Discarded Knight ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Their loyalty to Dany is what keeps\neveryone together:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>A&nbsp;young&nbsp;girl&nbsp;she\nmight be, but Daenerys Targaryen was the only thing that held them all\ntogether.</i></b><i>\n&ndash; The Queen&rsquo;s Hand ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>And\npeople continue fighting for Dany. Barristan deposes Hizdahr for the suspicion\nthat he was the one that tried to poison her. When Yunkai attacks in the TWOW\nchapters that were released, the Mother&rsquo;s Men, Free Brothers, Stalwart Shields,\nthe pit fighters and the Brazen Beasts are all there willing to fight, even\nthough Yunkai has the numerical advantage. And it&rsquo;s not only loyalty for Dany,\nbut also the hope that she gave them, that they can fight for their own freedom.\nThe revolution that Dany started is not just in her hands anymore, it&rsquo;s being\ncarried by everyone else. That&rsquo;s her legacy. And it&rsquo;s a great thing that\nDaenerys was able to accomplish that.</p><p>Dany\nis politically savvy. She is observant, capable of adapting to other cultures\nand to different situations, speaks several languages, listens to her people\nregardless of birth or social status, cares for women, sees her position of\nqueen as a duty to her people, is self critical, conciliatory, merciful (even if she does get angry and make mistakes sometimes), courteous,\nunderstands the importance of keeping up appearances and manipulating people&rsquo;s\nperceptions of her and of the different situations, is pragmatic, knows how to\nassess the strength of each man under her command and use them accordingly,\nalways tries to learn more and seeks for information, listens to counsel, is\nnot gullible but is not paranoid either, respects people&rsquo;s humanity and tries\nto make social chances that benefit the oppressed. She is good at understanding\npeople&rsquo;s motivations (like Hizdahr&rsquo;s true intentions in reopening the fighting\npits), she understands supply and demand, understands symbols of power (like\nthe tokar), understands that she can&rsquo;t answer people with brutality or else her\npeople will be afraid to come to her, and understands that she needs to be seen\ncaring about her people. She\nhas gained experience in managing the economy, avoiding corruption, commanding armies, diplomacy and\ncompromises. And she has gained a more mature understanding of peace and war.</p><p><a></a>Dany still has things to learn, of\ncourse. She has now decided on a fire and blood path. I do believe this is\nnecessary to end slavery and that making peace with the slavers was the wrong\nchoice. But it&rsquo;s also very likely that Dany will make mistakes, and at some\npoints, she might go too far with fire and blood.&nbsp;\n\nShe has an even bigger internal conflict coming her way in The Winds of Winter: how far is Dany willing to go? What kind of violence is justified?\n\n But this is important for\nDany to learn. She won&rsquo;t become the perfect ruler in a single day. And Dany has\nan even bigger responsibility, because she owns the only dragons in the entire\nworld, and has to learn how to wield a huge power responsibly.</p><p><a></a>But regardless of what happens in future books, I do think that, given all I discussed here, Dany is a great leader and a great ruler.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>For the longest time, I wanted to\nwrite about Dany as a leader and a ruler. Most of the time, the metas I see from\nDany haters just talk about what an awful ruler Dany is, and amongst Daenerys\nfans, this is usually not discussed a lot, mostly because I think Dany fans\nspend a lot of time defending Dany from the accusations that she is evil or\nmad, so other subjects are neglected. Before I start, I just want to make it\nclear that I am not any expert on medieval politics or war strategy, so this\nwill be mostly my understanding of the story. And of course, I can&rsquo;t forget to\nmention that many of the ideas of the Meereenese Blot are here as well, but\nthis is going to be my interpretation.</p>\n<p>In this analysis, I will show why I\nthink Daenerys is an intelligent and capable leader and ruler. I want to look\nat everything we know about Dany in all of the books: her childhood and education,\nher political beliefs, her actions and the economic and political situation\nshe&rsquo;s in. I&rsquo;ll try to focus on what Dany has learned in each book, and how it\nhelped her become a better leader.</p>\n<p>Some of the things I&rsquo;ll write here\nare similar to metas that I&rsquo;ve written before. But I want this one to be as\ncomplete as possible, and to analyze every facet of Dany&rsquo;s storyline as a ruler\nthat I can think of. I will bring book quotes to back up what I say, so this\nwill be <i>very</i> long (It&rsquo;s around 20k\nwords, so I hope at least someone will be interested in reading it, because I\nspent months scrutinizing all of the books to write this).</p>\n<p>In this essay, I will talk about the following topics:</p>\n<p><b>Dany&rsquo;s childhood and education</b></p>\n<p><b>Dany&rsquo;s intelligence, wisdom and introspectiveness</b></p>\n<p><b>Dany&rsquo;s changing political views</b></p>\n<p><b>Dany journey as a leader in A Game of Thrones</b></p>\n<p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Clash of Kings</b></p>\n<p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Storm of Swords<br /></b></p>\n<p><b>Dany&rsquo;s journey as a leader in A Dance with Dragons:<br /></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Economy</b></li>\n<li><b>The war against Yunkai and the question of peace and war</b></li>\n<li><b>The question of taking the wealth of the slave masters</b></li>\n<li><b>Conflicting interests within the city</b></li>\n<li><b>Morality</b></li>\n<li><b>Practical aspects or ruling</b></li>\n<li><b>Dany&rsquo;s equalitarian practices</b></li>\n<li><b>Some mistakes worth addressing</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Is Daenerys a good ruler?
