He\u2019d stayed up late texting Andi the\nnight before and his alarm had failed to go off, throwing his routine\ncompletely out the window. He\u2019d spilled milk on his shirt and had then needed\nto rearrange his whole outfit. And as if all that wasn\u2019t bad enough, his dad\nhad asked him about <i>girls</i> on the\ndrive to school. It was safe to say that his morning had been a rough one.</p><p>As a\nresult; however, he didn\u2019t notice the hushed whispers between his two best\nfriends that quieted as he approached them.</p><p>\u201cYou will\nnot believe the day I\u2019ve had so far,\u201d Cyrus began, before detailing the chaotic\nevents. \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cThat\nsucks, Cy,\u201d Andi said sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nthat\u2019s the worst.\u201d Buffy\u2019s equally supportive expression shifted into a broad\ngrin and wide, gleeful eyes. \u201cBut I know something that may make it better. Did\nyou hear about the updated reptile enclosure at the zoo? Apparently they have\nsome new thing called a Singleneck\u2026 Dinglebat\u2026 whatever, something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t\nhappen to be referring to a Shingleback Skink, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\nthat\u2019s what it was called. I can grab tickets if you want to go on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>\u2019If I want to go on Saturday\u2019</i> \u2013 of course\nI want to go! Do you want to come too, Andi?\u201d A secretive smirk crossed the\ngirl\u2019s lips but it was gone before Cyrus could really interpret it.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds\nlike fun, but I can\u2019t. I have plans with Bex and Bowie on Saturday. Sorry,\u201d she\nresponded apologetically.</p><p>Despite\nthat fact that only two-thirds of their crew could go, Cyrus\u2019 excitement was\npalpable. He hugged both of them and thanked Buffy for cheering him up as the\nfirst bell rang, forcing the friends to separate. A thought, innocent and quiet\nthough it may have been, gnawed faintly at the back of his head. <i>Would TJ be into this sort of thing? </i>He\nquickly dismissed it.</p><p>As Cyrus\nwalked away, Andi leaned over to Buffy and whispered in her ear, \u201cPhase one of\nOperation Tyrus is complete. Phase two is a-go.\u201d With complete and utter\nsincerity, they gave each other curt nods before Andi pulled out her phone to continue\ntheir (brilliant, flawless, utterly ingenious) plan.</p><p><b>Andi:</b> Amber, we need your help.</p><!-- more --><hr><p>Friday\nafternoon, a few days after Buffy\u2019s invitation to the zoo, consisted of the\nGood Hair Crew eating baby taters and drinking milkshakes at The Spoon, as per\nusual. Near the end of the latest performance of Tater Theatre (a showstopping\nepisode of <i>Tater Things</i>), the bell at\nthe door jingled, signaling the arrival of another customer. Cyrus ignored it, continuing\nhis reenactment.</p><p>\u201cTaters\u2026\ndon\u2019t\u2026lie,\u201d he whispered, mimicking Eleven\u2019s slow pacing. Three sets of giggles\nwere produced from his antics, between Buffy, Andi, and \u2013 wait. Three? He turned\naround to see TJ smiling softly at him.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\nWhat happens next?\u201d the athlete prompted, before joining the group at the\nbooth. If Cyrus\u2019 voice was slightly shakier than before as he finished his\nperformance, nobody made mention of it. </p><p>Upon the\nending, a cliffhanger in which Tater Eleven goes missing after a fight with her\nfriends, the rest of the group clapped appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cBy far\nthe best one yet,\u201d Andi grinned.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. My\nfavorite part was - \u201c</p><p>\u201cTJ!\u201d a\nvoice called out, interrupting Buffy midsentence. \u201cWhen did you get here? Do\nyou have what I asked for?\u201d It was Amber.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nhere,\u201d he said, handing her a red, leather jacket he\u2019d had under his arm. \u201cWhy\ndo you need this anyway? It\u2019s not even that cold outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s\ncold in here, that\u2019s why.\u201d She threw it over her shoulder and waved to her\nbrother\u2019s tablemates amiably. \u201cI gotta get back to work, but thanks for the\ncoat, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nyeah,\u201d he responded dismissively. It was then that Buffy\u2019s phone began to ring,\nthe upbeat, hip-hop ringtone echoing in the diner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nMarty,\u201d she explained, before picking it up. Everyone at the table casually\nmade themselves busy, not wanting to appear to be eavesdropping on her phone\ncall while doing exactly that. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?&hellip; That\u2019s Saturday?&hellip; I know, I\njust lost track of the days\u2026 hold on, I have to talk to Cyrus first\u2026 yeah\u2026 sure\u2026\nalright, I\u2019ll text you\u2026 yeah\u2026 okay\u2026 bye.\u201d As she hung up, Cyrus looked at her\ncuriously.</p><p>\u201cWhat did\nhe say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally\nforgot that Marty and I were supposed to go to a women\u2019s basketball game\ntomorrow. But it\u2019s just a date; it\u2019s not really a big deal\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nlet you miss a date for the<i> zoo</i>! We\ncan go another time.\u201d While a little disappointed, his excitement on his friend\u2019s\nbehalf outweighed it by far.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want\nthe tickets to go to waste\u2026,\u201d Buffy began. \u201cUnless\u2026 maybe TJ would like to go with\nyou? What do you say?\u201d she posed, turning to TJ for his opinion on the matter. It\nwas at this time that Cyrus\u2019 brain helpfully reminded him of his conversation\nwith Andi a few days prior. So this was their plan all along. His lips\nstretched into a strained smile and, as TJ wasn\u2019t looking in his direction, gave\nhis friends a frantic, wide-eyed look that he hoped conveyed just how against this\nhe was.</p><p>\u201cSure,\nsounds fun. As long as you\u2019re cool with it, Underdog?\u201d TJ answered, the use of the\nnickname making Cyrus\u2019 heart flutter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yep,\nall good with me,\u201d he agreed, laughing nervously as worry settled deep in his\nchest.</p><p>After TJ\nleft, Cyrus could do nothing but turn to the devious pair that had plotted this\ncruel and unusual torture and say, \u201cI hate you both.</p><hr><p>TJ was\npicking him up in an hour and a half. He had an hour and a half until it was\njust the two of them, on what was definitely not a date, at one of the few\nplaces Cyrus would not be able to hold in his dorkiness. Perfect.</p><p>What was\nhe going to wear? Should he dress casual? Semi-formal? Semi-casual? What if he overdresses?\nWhat if he underdresses? What if TJ secretly hates brown shoes and-? At this\nrate, he was going to have a heart attack. There was only one thing he could\ndo.</p><p><i>Dialing Andi\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cYou guys got\nme into this mess and now you have to deal with the consequences. Help me choose\nan outfit before I go into cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026We\nshould have known this would happen. Okay, what are our options.\u201d Cyrus gave the\ngirl as accurate a description as he could provide (accompanied by pictures for\nreference, of course) of his top ten choices and, after much bemoaning on Andi\u2019s\npart and much anxiety on his, they decided on something casual, but not so much\nso that he appeared careless. With that, Cyrus hung up, thanking Andi for her\nhelp (however reluctant she may have been to provide it in the first place). From\nthere, he ran to the bathroom and, with a comb in one hand and hairspray in the\nother, he set to work on his hair. And that was when the doorbell rang.</p><p><i>Why do I have to be attracted to timely\ngentlemen?! Can\u2019t a cute boy just be late for once? </i>Cyrus thought as he raced downstairs,\ncalling out for his mom.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong, Cyrus? And who\u2019s at the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend\nTJ and I were supposed to go the zoo today but I wasn\u2019t done with my hair and\nnow I\u2019ve probably messed it up again because I was running like an idiot and he\u2019s\nwaiting at the door and oh gosh what if he\u2019s been waiting too long and he\ndecides to just leave and what if he\u2019s upset with me and-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\neverything is fine,\u201d she reassured him. \u201cNow, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m\ngoing to get the door and keep this TJ preoccupied while you go and finish\ngetting ready for your date, okay?\u201d If life was a movie, this would be the\nscene in which, after a rather unexpected reveal of undisclosed information,\nthe other person\u2019s surprise would be exaggerated by a fast-paced zoom-in of\ntheir shocked expression. Alas, life is not a movie, so Cyrus did the only\nthing he could: denial.</p><p>\u201cDate? Pssh,\nit\u2019s not a date \u2013 what would make you say that? No way, not a date, nope not at\nall, just two guys hanging out, no big deal, just a chill, not at all romantic\nthing with two people who are not at all interested in each other, you know\ndoing guy stuff like going to the zoo, as\u2026 guys do. Do\u2026 guys do that normally?\u201d\nhe sputtered. His mom only smiled down at him.</p><p>\u201cFirst of\nall, you\u2019re way too nervous for this to not be a date. I\u2019m also your mom and a\nperson with eyes \u2013 I can clearly see you like this boy. Now finish up and don\u2019t\nleave him waiting too long, <i>scheifale</i>.\u201d\nCyrus flushed bright red but did as he was told.</p><p>Upon\n(finally) getting the last chunk of hair to lay down just right, he made his\nway back downstairs, only to find his mother and his crush chatting amiably on\nthe couch.</p><p>\u201c- a\nreally great guy. It\u2019s kinda silly but Cyrus makes me a better person. Despite\neverything bad I\u2019ve done, he still cares and that\u2019s something. Nobody else would\u2019ve\nstuck around after all that, but he did.\u201d</p><p>At that point,\nCyrus decided to make his presence known, clearing his throat with tomato-red\ncheeks and an embarrassed smile. TJ looked up from his place on the couch, a\nbroad beam transforming his face into something bright and warm.</p><p>\u201cHey Underdog!\nReady to go?\u201d Cyrus nodded in response. \u201cGreat! Oh, and, uh, it was nice to\nmeet you Mrs. Goodman,\u201d the blonde said, politely stuck out his hand. She\nchuckled and shook it.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\nTJ. Tell Amber I said hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\nthing.\u201d The pair turned to leave, not knowing that the other\u2019s heart was\nbeating just as rapidly as their own. </p><p><i>Ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom.</i></p><hr><p>The zoo\ntrip was\u2026 perfect to say the least. TJ didn\u2019t even get annoyed when Cyrus\nprattled on about the reptiles (\u201cDid you know that Shingleback Skinks are one\nof the only monogamous reptiles? Mates will literally follow each other around\nand they can always recognize their partner. How cute is that?\u201d).</p><p>And yet,\nthe taller of the two had been rather quiet during the walk back to Cyrus\u2019\nhouse, fidgeting with something, only to shove it back in his pocket before\nCyrus could figure out what it was.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026\nhave fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\nhad a blast, Underdog, thank you for, um, inviting me,\u201d he said, smiling\nweakly. Cyrus\u2019 eyebrows knitted in confusion and worry.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nsure? You don\u2019t sound super sure. You don\u2019t have to pretend, it\u2019s okay. It was\nprobably kind of lame and all -.\u201d TJ put a hand on his shoulder before his\nnervous ramblings could go on.</p><p>\u201cI promise\nthat I had a good time, I just\u2026 do you remember what you said about that one lizard-thing?\nThe Stringle-whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nShingleback Skink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah that\none.

Near the end of the latest performance of Tater Theatre (a showstopping\nepisode of <i>Tater Things</i>), the bell at\nthe door jingled, signaling the arrival of another customer. Cyrus ignored it, continuing\nhis reenactment.</p><p>\u201cTaters\u2026\ndon\u2019t\u2026lie,\u201d he whispered, mimicking Eleven\u2019s slow pacing. Three sets of giggles\nwere produced from his antics, between Buffy, Andi, and \u2013 wait. Three? He turned\naround to see TJ smiling softly at him.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\nWhat happens next?\u201d the athlete prompted, before joining the group at the\nbooth. If Cyrus\u2019 voice was slightly shakier than before as he finished his\nperformance, nobody made mention of it. </p><p>Upon the\nending, a cliffhanger in which Tater Eleven goes missing after a fight with her\nfriends, the rest of the group clapped appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cBy far\nthe best one yet,\u201d Andi grinned.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. My\nfavorite part was - \u201c</p><p>\u201cTJ!\u201d a\nvoice called out, interrupting Buffy midsentence. \u201cWhen did you get here? Do\nyou have what I asked for?\u201d It was Amber.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nhere,\u201d he said, handing her a red, leather jacket he\u2019d had under his arm. \u201cWhy\ndo you need this anyway? It\u2019s not even that cold outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s\ncold in here, that\u2019s why.\u201d She threw it over her shoulder and waved to her\nbrother\u2019s tablemates amiably. \u201cI gotta get back to work, but thanks for the\ncoat, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nyeah,\u201d he responded dismissively. It was then that Buffy\u2019s phone began to ring,\nthe upbeat, hip-hop ringtone echoing in the diner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nMarty,\u201d she explained, before picking it up. Everyone at the table casually\nmade themselves busy, not wanting to appear to be eavesdropping on her phone\ncall while doing exactly that. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u2026 That\u2019s Saturday?\u2026 I know, I\njust lost track of the days\u2026 hold on, I have to talk to Cyrus first\u2026 yeah\u2026 sure\u2026\nalright, I\u2019ll text you\u2026 yeah\u2026 okay\u2026 bye.\u201d As she hung up, Cyrus looked at her\ncuriously.</p><p>\u201cWhat did\nhe say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally\nforgot that Marty and I were supposed to go to a women\u2019s basketball game\ntomorrow. But it\u2019s just a date; it\u2019s not really a big deal\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nlet you miss a date for the<i> zoo</i>! We\ncan go another time.\u201d While a little disappointed, his excitement on his friend\u2019s\nbehalf outweighed it by far.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want\nthe tickets to go to waste\u2026,\u201d Buffy began. \u201cUnless\u2026 maybe TJ would like to go with\nyou? What do you say?\u201d she posed, turning to TJ for his opinion on the matter. It\nwas at this time that Cyrus\u2019 brain helpfully reminded him of his conversation\nwith Andi a few days prior. So this was their plan all along. His lips\nstretched into a strained smile and, as TJ wasn\u2019t looking in his direction, gave\nhis friends a frantic, wide-eyed look that he hoped conveyed just how against this\nhe was.</p><p>\u201cSure,\nsounds fun. As long as you\u2019re cool with it, Underdog?\u201d TJ answered, the use of the\nnickname making Cyrus\u2019 heart flutter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yep,\nall good with me,\u201d he agreed, laughing nervously as worry settled deep in his\nchest.</p><p>After TJ\nleft, Cyrus could do nothing but turn to the devious pair that had plotted this\ncruel and unusual torture and say, \u201cI hate you both.</p><hr><p>TJ was\npicking him up in an hour and a half. He had an hour and a half until it was\njust the two of them, on what was definitely not a date, at one of the few\nplaces Cyrus would not be able to hold in his dorkiness. Perfect.</p><p>What was\nhe going to wear? Should he dress casual? Semi-formal? Semi-casual? What if he overdresses?\nWhat if he underdresses? What if TJ secretly hates brown shoes and-? At this\nrate, he was going to have a heart attack. There was only one thing he could\ndo.</p><p><i>Dialing Andi\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cYou guys got\nme into this mess and now you have to deal with the consequences. Help me choose\nan outfit before I go into cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026We\nshould have known this would happen. Okay, what are our options.\u201d Cyrus gave the\ngirl as accurate a description as he could provide (accompanied by pictures for\nreference, of course) of his top ten choices and, after much bemoaning on Andi\u2019s\npart and much anxiety on his, they decided on something casual, but not so much\nso that he appeared careless. With that, Cyrus hung up, thanking Andi for her\nhelp (however reluctant she may have been to provide it in the first place). From\nthere, he ran to the bathroom and, with a comb in one hand and hairspray in the\nother, he set to work on his hair. And that was when the doorbell rang.</p><p><i>Why do I have to be attracted to timely\ngentlemen?! Can\u2019t a cute boy just be late for once? </i>Cyrus thought as he raced downstairs,\ncalling out for his mom.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong, Cyrus? And who\u2019s at the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend\nTJ and I were supposed to go the zoo today but I wasn\u2019t done with my hair and\nnow I\u2019ve probably messed it up again because I was running like an idiot and he\u2019s\nwaiting at the door and oh gosh what if he\u2019s been waiting too long and he\ndecides to just leave and what if he\u2019s upset with me and-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\neverything is fine,\u201d she reassured him. \u201cNow, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m\ngoing to get the door and keep this TJ preoccupied while you go and finish\ngetting ready for your date, okay?\u201d If life was a movie, this would be the\nscene in which, after a rather unexpected reveal of undisclosed information,\nthe other person\u2019s surprise would be exaggerated by a fast-paced zoom-in of\ntheir shocked expression. Alas, life is not a movie, so Cyrus did the only\nthing he could: denial.</p><p>\u201cDate? Pssh,\nit\u2019s not a date \u2013 what would make you say that? No way, not a date, nope not at\nall, just two guys hanging out, no big deal, just a chill, not at all romantic\nthing with two people who are not at all interested in each other, you know\ndoing guy stuff like going to the zoo, as\u2026 guys do. Do\u2026 guys do that normally?\u201d\nhe sputtered. His mom only smiled down at him.</p><p>\u201cFirst of\nall, you\u2019re way too nervous for this to not be a date. I\u2019m also your mom and a\nperson with eyes \u2013 I can clearly see you like this boy. Now finish up and don\u2019t\nleave him waiting too long, <i>scheifale</i>.\u201d\nCyrus flushed bright red but did as he was told.</p><p>Upon\n(finally) getting the last chunk of hair to lay down just right, he made his\nway back downstairs, only to find his mother and his crush chatting amiably on\nthe couch.</p><p>\u201c- a\nreally great guy. It\u2019s kinda silly but Cyrus makes me a better person. Despite\neverything bad I\u2019ve done, he still cares and that\u2019s something. Nobody else would\u2019ve\nstuck around after all that, but he did.\u201d</p><p>At that point,\nCyrus decided to make his presence known, clearing his throat with tomato-red\ncheeks and an embarrassed smile. TJ looked up from his place on the couch, a\nbroad beam transforming his face into something bright and warm.</p><p>\u201cHey Underdog!\nReady to go?\u201d Cyrus nodded in response. \u201cGreat! Oh, and, uh, it was nice to\nmeet you Mrs. Goodman,\u201d the blonde said, politely stuck out his hand. She\nchuckled and shook it.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\nTJ. Tell Amber I said hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\nthing.\u201d The pair turned to leave, not knowing that the other\u2019s heart was\nbeating just as rapidly as their own. </p><p><i>Ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom.</i></p><hr><p>The zoo\ntrip was\u2026 perfect to say the least. TJ didn\u2019t even get annoyed when Cyrus\nprattled on about the reptiles (\u201cDid you know that Shingleback Skinks are one\nof the only monogamous reptiles? Mates will literally follow each other around\nand they can always recognize their partner. How cute is that?\u201d).</p><p>And yet,\nthe taller of the two had been rather quiet during the walk back to Cyrus\u2019\nhouse, fidgeting with something, only to shove it back in his pocket before\nCyrus could figure out what it was.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026\nhave fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\nhad a blast, Underdog, thank you for, um, inviting me,\u201d he said, smiling\nweakly. Cyrus\u2019 eyebrows knitted in confusion and worry.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nsure? You don\u2019t sound super sure. You don\u2019t have to pretend, it\u2019s okay. It was\nprobably kind of lame and all -.\u201d TJ put a hand on his shoulder before his\nnervous ramblings could go on.</p><p>\u201cI promise\nthat I had a good time, I just\u2026 do you remember what you said about that one lizard-thing?\nThe Stringle-whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nShingleback Skink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah that\none. You said that they can always tell which one is their mate \u2013 that they\nnever forget their face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are\nyou going with this?\u201d TJ took a deep breath and appeared to steel himself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ll ever forget you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeej\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stop\nme if this is weird okay? I just\u2026 when Buffy asked me to get you that muffin,\nback when I was all hair gel and bitterness, even then I knew you were\nsomething special. Something that I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know, taint, like everything\nelse I touch. And I tried not to mess up, but like always, I did. Only, you didn\u2019t\nstop believing in me and supporting me. Then today, it was just you and me and\nI\u2026 really don\u2019t want it to be over. I don\u2019t want to end today if it\u2019s just us \u2018hanging\nout\u2019. I want to do this over and over again because I want to be with you over\nand over again.\u201d TJ paused for a moment and took the object he\u2019d been fiddling\nwith out of his pocket. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at this, am I? Just \u2013 here, I saw\nthis and thought of you.\u201d</p><p>The\nflustered boy handed him a small pin. On it was the Shingleback Skink with its\nbody forming part of the border of a heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2026\nis this your way of asking for this to be a date?\u201d Cyrus asked, confused but hopeful.\nTJ sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is\nthat\u2026 okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?

Near the end of the latest performance of Tater Theatre (a showstopping\nepisode of <i>Tater Things</i>), the bell at\nthe door jingled, signaling the arrival of another customer. Cyrus ignored it, continuing\nhis reenactment.</p><p>\u201cTaters\u2026\ndon\u2019t\u2026lie,\u201d he whispered, mimicking Eleven\u2019s slow pacing. Three sets of giggles\nwere produced from his antics, between Buffy, Andi, and \u2013 wait. Three? He turned\naround to see TJ smiling softly at him.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\nWhat happens next?\u201d the athlete prompted, before joining the group at the\nbooth. If Cyrus\u2019 voice was slightly shakier than before as he finished his\nperformance, nobody made mention of it. </p><p>Upon the\nending, a cliffhanger in which Tater Eleven goes missing after a fight with her\nfriends, the rest of the group clapped appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cBy far\nthe best one yet,\u201d Andi grinned.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. My\nfavorite part was - \u201c</p><p>\u201cTJ!\u201d a\nvoice called out, interrupting Buffy midsentence. \u201cWhen did you get here? Do\nyou have what I asked for?\u201d It was Amber.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nhere,\u201d he said, handing her a red, leather jacket he\u2019d had under his arm. \u201cWhy\ndo you need this anyway? It\u2019s not even that cold outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s\ncold in here, that\u2019s why.\u201d She threw it over her shoulder and waved to her\nbrother\u2019s tablemates amiably. \u201cI gotta get back to work, but thanks for the\ncoat, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nyeah,\u201d he responded dismissively. It was then that Buffy\u2019s phone began to ring,\nthe upbeat, hip-hop ringtone echoing in the diner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nMarty,\u201d she explained, before picking it up. Everyone at the table casually\nmade themselves busy, not wanting to appear to be eavesdropping on her phone\ncall while doing exactly that. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u2026 That\u2019s Saturday?\u2026 I know, I\njust lost track of the days\u2026 hold on, I have to talk to Cyrus first\u2026 yeah\u2026 sure\u2026\nalright, I\u2019ll text you\u2026 yeah\u2026 okay\u2026 bye.\u201d As she hung up, Cyrus looked at her\ncuriously.</p><p>\u201cWhat did\nhe say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally\nforgot that Marty and I were supposed to go to a women\u2019s basketball game\ntomorrow. But it\u2019s just a date; it\u2019s not really a big deal\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nlet you miss a date for the<i> zoo</i>! We\ncan go another time.\u201d While a little disappointed, his excitement on his friend\u2019s\nbehalf outweighed it by far.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want\nthe tickets to go to waste\u2026,\u201d Buffy began. \u201cUnless\u2026 maybe TJ would like to go with\nyou? What do you say?\u201d she posed, turning to TJ for his opinion on the matter. It\nwas at this time that Cyrus\u2019 brain helpfully reminded him of his conversation\nwith Andi a few days prior. So this was their plan all along. His lips\nstretched into a strained smile and, as TJ wasn\u2019t looking in his direction, gave\nhis friends a frantic, wide-eyed look that he hoped conveyed just how against this\nhe was.</p><p>\u201cSure,\nsounds fun. As long as you\u2019re cool with it, Underdog?\u201d TJ answered, the use of the\nnickname making Cyrus\u2019 heart flutter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yep,\nall good with me,\u201d he agreed, laughing nervously as worry settled deep in his\nchest.</p><p>After TJ\nleft, Cyrus could do nothing but turn to the devious pair that had plotted this\ncruel and unusual torture and say, \u201cI hate you both.</p><hr><p>TJ was\npicking him up in an hour and a half. He had an hour and a half until it was\njust the two of them, on what was definitely not a date, at one of the few\nplaces Cyrus would not be able to hold in his dorkiness. Perfect.</p><p>What was\nhe going to wear? Should he dress casual? Semi-formal? Semi-casual? What if he overdresses?\nWhat if he underdresses? What if TJ secretly hates brown shoes and-? At this\nrate, he was going to have a heart attack. There was only one thing he could\ndo.</p><p><i>Dialing Andi\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cYou guys got\nme into this mess and now you have to deal with the consequences. Help me choose\nan outfit before I go into cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026We\nshould have known this would happen. Okay, what are our options.\u201d Cyrus gave the\ngirl as accurate a description as he could provide (accompanied by pictures for\nreference, of course) of his top ten choices and, after much bemoaning on Andi\u2019s\npart and much anxiety on his, they decided on something casual, but not so much\nso that he appeared careless. With that, Cyrus hung up, thanking Andi for her\nhelp (however reluctant she may have been to provide it in the first place). From\nthere, he ran to the bathroom and, with a comb in one hand and hairspray in the\nother, he set to work on his hair. And that was when the doorbell rang.</p><p><i>Why do I have to be attracted to timely\ngentlemen?! Can\u2019t a cute boy just be late for once? </i>Cyrus thought as he raced downstairs,\ncalling out for his mom.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong, Cyrus? And who\u2019s at the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend\nTJ and I were supposed to go the zoo today but I wasn\u2019t done with my hair and\nnow I\u2019ve probably messed it up again because I was running like an idiot and he\u2019s\nwaiting at the door and oh gosh what if he\u2019s been waiting too long and he\ndecides to just leave and what if he\u2019s upset with me and-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\neverything is fine,\u201d she reassured him. \u201cNow, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m\ngoing to get the door and keep this TJ preoccupied while you go and finish\ngetting ready for your date, okay?\u201d If life was a movie, this would be the\nscene in which, after a rather unexpected reveal of undisclosed information,\nthe other person\u2019s surprise would be exaggerated by a fast-paced zoom-in of\ntheir shocked expression. Alas, life is not a movie, so Cyrus did the only\nthing he could: denial.</p><p>\u201cDate? Pssh,\nit\u2019s not a date \u2013 what would make you say that? No way, not a date, nope not at\nall, just two guys hanging out, no big deal, just a chill, not at all romantic\nthing with two people who are not at all interested in each other, you know\ndoing guy stuff like going to the zoo, as\u2026 guys do. Do\u2026 guys do that normally?\u201d\nhe sputtered. His mom only smiled down at him.</p><p>\u201cFirst of\nall, you\u2019re way too nervous for this to not be a date. I\u2019m also your mom and a\nperson with eyes \u2013 I can clearly see you like this boy. Now finish up and don\u2019t\nleave him waiting too long, <i>scheifale</i>.\u201d\nCyrus flushed bright red but did as he was told.</p><p>Upon\n(finally) getting the last chunk of hair to lay down just right, he made his\nway back downstairs, only to find his mother and his crush chatting amiably on\nthe couch.</p><p>\u201c- a\nreally great guy. It\u2019s kinda silly but Cyrus makes me a better person. Despite\neverything bad I\u2019ve done, he still cares and that\u2019s something. Nobody else would\u2019ve\nstuck around after all that, but he did.\u201d</p><p>At that point,\nCyrus decided to make his presence known, clearing his throat with tomato-red\ncheeks and an embarrassed smile. TJ looked up from his place on the couch, a\nbroad beam transforming his face into something bright and warm.</p><p>\u201cHey Underdog!\nReady to go?\u201d Cyrus nodded in response. \u201cGreat! Oh, and, uh, it was nice to\nmeet you Mrs. Goodman,\u201d the blonde said, politely stuck out his hand. She\nchuckled and shook it.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\nTJ. Tell Amber I said hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\nthing.\u201d The pair turned to leave, not knowing that the other\u2019s heart was\nbeating just as rapidly as their own. </p><p><i>Ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom.</i></p><hr><p>The zoo\ntrip was\u2026 perfect to say the least. TJ didn\u2019t even get annoyed when Cyrus\nprattled on about the reptiles (\u201cDid you know that Shingleback Skinks are one\nof the only monogamous reptiles? Mates will literally follow each other around\nand they can always recognize their partner. How cute is that?\u201d).</p><p>And yet,\nthe taller of the two had been rather quiet during the walk back to Cyrus\u2019\nhouse, fidgeting with something, only to shove it back in his pocket before\nCyrus could figure out what it was.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026\nhave fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\nhad a blast, Underdog, thank you for, um, inviting me,\u201d he said, smiling\nweakly. Cyrus\u2019 eyebrows knitted in confusion and worry.</p><p>\u201cAre you\nsure? You don\u2019t sound super sure. You don\u2019t have to pretend, it\u2019s okay. It was\nprobably kind of lame and all -.\u201d TJ put a hand on his shoulder before his\nnervous ramblings could go on.</p><p>\u201cI promise\nthat I had a good time, I just\u2026 do you remember what you said about that one lizard-thing?\nThe Stringle-whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nShingleback Skink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah that\none. You said that they can always tell which one is their mate \u2013 that they\nnever forget their face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are\nyou going with this?\u201d TJ took a deep breath and appeared to steel himself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ll ever forget you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeej\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stop\nme if this is weird okay? I just\u2026 when Buffy asked me to get you that muffin,\nback when I was all hair gel and bitterness, even then I knew you were\nsomething special. Something that I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know, taint, like everything\nelse I touch. And I tried not to mess up, but like always, I did. Only, you didn\u2019t\nstop believing in me and supporting me. Then today, it was just you and me and\nI\u2026 really don\u2019t want it to be over. I don\u2019t want to end today if it\u2019s just us \u2018hanging\nout\u2019. I want to do this over and over again because I want to be with you over\nand over again.\u201d TJ paused for a moment and took the object he\u2019d been fiddling\nwith out of his pocket. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at this, am I? Just \u2013 here, I saw\nthis and thought of you.\u201d</p><p>The\nflustered boy handed him a small pin. On it was the Shingleback Skink with its\nbody forming part of the border of a heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2026\nis this your way of asking for this to be a date?\u201d Cyrus asked, confused but hopeful.\nTJ sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is\nthat\u2026 okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay? TJ,\u201d\nCyrus began, grinning and a little teary, before placing his hands gently on TJ\u2019s\ncheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><hr><p><i>(Bonus)</i><br>\nThat Monday, when they all returned to school, Buffy and Andi anxiously awaited\ntheir friend\u2019s arrival to see if their plan worked. When Cyrus showed up\nhand-in-hand with TJ Kippen, the pair knew their answer. Just then, their phones\nbuzzed and they looked down to see a series of unread texts.</p><p><b>Amber:</b> I haven\u2019t gotten to talk to Teej\nsince his date and I need to know how it went.</p><p><b>Amber:</b> So??? Details???</p><p><b>Marty:</b> As an honorary, though minor,\nmember of this plan, I too would like to know\u2026</p><p><b>Marty:</b> Did it work?</p><p><b>Amber:</b> You can\u2019t leave us in suspense\nlike this</p><p><b>Amber:</b> It\u2019s cruel</p><p>Buffy and Andi\nturned to each other and their pride and joy was tangible. They\u2019d both had\nissues with TJ. He\u2019d made dumb mistakes, but looking back, they knew that they\nweren\u2019t innocent either. And, more importantly, he cared about Cyrus. They all did.\nAnd now their friend was getting the happy ending he deserved.</p><p>\u201cOperation\nTyrus. Mission status: complete.\u201d</p>",

And who&rsquo;s at the door?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My friend\nTJ and I were supposed to go the zoo today but I wasn&rsquo;t done with my hair and\nnow I&rsquo;ve probably messed it up again because I was running like an idiot and he&rsquo;s\nwaiting at the door and oh gosh what if he&rsquo;s been waiting too long and he\ndecides to just leave and what if he&rsquo;s upset with me and-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Slow down,\neverything is fine,&rdquo; she reassured him. &ldquo;Now, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do. I&rsquo;m\ngoing to get the door and keep this TJ preoccupied while you go and finish\ngetting ready for your date, okay?&rdquo; If life was a movie, this would be the\nscene in which, after a rather unexpected reveal of undisclosed information,\nthe other person&rsquo;s surprise would be exaggerated by a fast-paced zoom-in of\ntheir shocked expression. Alas, life is not a movie, so Cyrus did the only\nthing he could: denial.</p><p>&ldquo;Date? Pssh,\nit&rsquo;s not a date &ndash; what would make you say that? No way, not a date, nope not at\nall, just two guys hanging out, no big deal, just a chill, not at all romantic\nthing with two people who are not at all interested in each other, you know\ndoing guy stuff like going to the zoo, as&hellip; guys do. Do&hellip; guys do that normally?&rdquo;\nhe sputtered. His mom only smiled down at him.</p><p>&ldquo;First of\nall, you&rsquo;re way too nervous for this to not be a date. I&rsquo;m also your mom and a\nperson with eyes &ndash; I can clearly see you like this boy. Now finish up and don&rsquo;t\nleave him waiting too long, <i>scheifale</i>.&rdquo;\nCyrus flushed bright red but did as he was told.</p><p>Upon\n(finally) getting the last chunk of hair to lay down just right, he made his\nway back downstairs, only to find his mother and his crush chatting amiably on\nthe couch.</p><p>&ldquo;- a\nreally great guy. It&rsquo;s kinda silly but Cyrus makes me a better person. Despite\neverything bad I&rsquo;ve done, he still cares and that&rsquo;s something. Nobody else would&rsquo;ve\nstuck around after all that, but he did.&rdquo;</p><p>At that point,\nCyrus decided to make his presence known, clearing his throat with tomato-red\ncheeks and an embarrassed smile. TJ looked up from his place on the couch, a\nbroad beam transforming his face into something bright and warm.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Underdog!\nReady to go?&rdquo; Cyrus nodded in response. &ldquo;Great! Oh, and, uh, it was nice to\nmeet you Mrs. Goodman,&rdquo; the blonde said, politely stuck out his hand. She\nchuckled and shook it.</p><p>&ldquo;You too,\nTJ. Tell Amber I said hello.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure\nthing.&rdquo; The pair turned to leave, not knowing that the other&rsquo;s heart was\nbeating just as rapidly as their own. </p><p><i>Ba-boom ba-boom ba-boom.</i></p><hr /><p>The zoo\ntrip was&hellip; perfect to say the least. TJ didn&rsquo;t even get annoyed when Cyrus\nprattled on about the reptiles (&ldquo;Did you know that Shingleback Skinks are one\nof the only monogamous reptiles? Mates will literally follow each other around\nand they can always recognize their partner. How cute is that?&rdquo;).</p><p>And yet,\nthe taller of the two had been rather quiet during the walk back to Cyrus&rsquo;\nhouse, fidgeting with something, only to shove it back in his pocket before\nCyrus could figure out what it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you&hellip;\nhave fun?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I\nhad a blast, Underdog, thank you for, um, inviting me,&rdquo; he said, smiling\nweakly. Cyrus&rsquo; eyebrows knitted in confusion and worry.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nsure? You don&rsquo;t sound super sure. You don&rsquo;t have to pretend, it&rsquo;s okay. It was\nprobably kind of lame and all -.&rdquo; TJ put a hand on his shoulder before his\nnervous ramblings could go on.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise\nthat I had a good time, I just&hellip; do you remember what you said about that one lizard-thing?\nThe Stringle-whatever?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The\nShingleback Skink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah that\none. You said that they can always tell which one is their mate &ndash; that they\nnever forget their face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are\nyou going with this?&rdquo; TJ took a deep breath and appeared to steel himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think\nI&rsquo;ll ever forget you either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Teej&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just stop\nme if this is weird okay? I just&hellip; when Buffy asked me to get you that muffin,\nback when I was all hair gel and bitterness, even then I knew you were\nsomething special. Something that I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, taint, like everything\nelse I touch. And I tried not to mess up, but like always, I did. Only, you didn&rsquo;t\nstop believing in me and supporting me. Then today, it was just you and me and\nI&hellip; really don&rsquo;t want it to be over. I don&rsquo;t want to end today if it&rsquo;s just us &lsquo;hanging\nout&rsquo;. I want to do this over and over again because I want to be with you over\nand over again.&rdquo; TJ paused for a moment and took the object he&rsquo;d been fiddling\nwith out of his pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very good at this, am I? Just &ndash; here, I saw\nthis and thought of you.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nflustered boy handed him a small pin. On it was the Shingleback Skink with its\nbody forming part of the border of a heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you&hellip;\nis this your way of asking for this to be a date?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, confused but hopeful.\nTJ sighed in relief.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Is\nthat&hellip; okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay? TJ,&rdquo;\nCyrus began, grinning and a little teary, before placing his hands gently on TJ&rsquo;s\ncheeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><i>(Bonus)</i><br />\nThat Monday, when they all returned to school, Buffy and Andi anxiously awaited\ntheir friend&rsquo;s arrival to see if their plan worked. When Cyrus showed up\nhand-in-hand with TJ Kippen, the pair knew their answer. Just then, their phones\nbuzzed and they looked down to see a series of unread texts.</p><p><b>Amber:</b> I haven&rsquo;t gotten to talk to Teej\nsince his date and I need to know how it went.</p><p><b>Amber:</b> So??? Details???</p><p><b>Marty:</b> As an honorary, though minor,\nmember of this plan, I too would like to know&hellip;</p><p><b>Marty:</b> Did it work?</p><p><b>Amber:</b> You can&rsquo;t leave us in suspense\nlike this</p><p><b>Amber:</b> It&rsquo;s cruel</p><p>Buffy and Andi\nturned to each other and their pride and joy was tangible. They&rsquo;d both had\nissues with TJ. He&rsquo;d made dumb mistakes, but looking back, they knew that they\nweren&rsquo;t innocent either. And, more importantly, he cared about Cyrus. They all did.\nAnd now their friend was getting the happy ending he deserved.</p><p>&ldquo;Operation\nTyrus. Mission status: complete.&rdquo;</p>",

He&rsquo;d stayed up late texting Andi the\nnight before and his alarm had failed to go off, throwing his routine\ncompletely out the window. He&rsquo;d spilled milk on his shirt and had then needed\nto rearrange his whole outfit. And as if all that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, his dad\nhad asked him about <i>girls</i> on the\ndrive to school. It was safe to say that his morning had been a rough one.</p>\n<p>As a\nresult; however, he didn&rsquo;t notice the hushed whispers between his two best\nfriends that quieted as he approached them.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You will\nnot believe the day I&rsquo;ve had so far,&rdquo; Cyrus began, before detailing the chaotic\nevents. &nbsp; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;That\nsucks, Cy,&rdquo; Andi said sympathetically.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nthat&rsquo;s the worst.&rdquo; Buffy&rsquo;s equally supportive expression shifted into a broad\ngrin and wide, gleeful eyes. &ldquo;But I know something that may make it better. Did\nyou hear about the updated reptile enclosure at the zoo? Apparently they have\nsome new thing called a Singleneck&hellip; Dinglebat&hellip; whatever, something like that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip; You wouldn&rsquo;t\nhappen to be referring to a Shingleback Skink, would you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think\nthat&rsquo;s what it was called. I can grab tickets if you want to go on Saturday?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>&rsquo;If I want to go on Saturday&rsquo;</i> &ndash; of course\nI want to go! Do you want to come too, Andi?&rdquo; A secretive smirk crossed the\ngirl&rsquo;s lips but it was gone before Cyrus could really interpret it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It sounds\nlike fun, but I can&rsquo;t. I have plans with Bex and Bowie on Saturday. Sorry,&rdquo; she\nresponded apologetically.</p>\n<p>Despite\nthat fact that only two-thirds of their crew could go, Cyrus&rsquo; excitement was\npalpable. He hugged both of them and thanked Buffy for cheering him up as the\nfirst bell rang, forcing the friends to separate. A thought, innocent and quiet\nthough it may have been, gnawed faintly at the back of his head. <i>Would TJ be into this sort of thing? </i>He\nquickly dismissed it.</p>\n<p>As Cyrus\nwalked away, Andi leaned over to Buffy and whispered in her ear, &ldquo;Phase one of\nOperation Tyrus is complete. Phase two is a-go.&rdquo; With complete and utter\nsincerity, they gave each other curt nods before Andi pulled out her phone to continue\ntheir (brilliant, flawless, utterly ingenious) plan.</p>\n<p><b>Andi:</b> Amber, we need your help.</p>\n</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Note: This is my first attempt at a chaptered fic. It\u2019s mostly canon compliant, but I did give T.J. an actual friend other than Cyrus so he\u2019s not an almost loner, and I\u2019m adding some of T.J.\u2019s home life. It\u2019s mostly just a fluffy\u00a0holiday fic with T.J. and Cyrus.\u00a0I am planning around 6-8 chapters, and\u00a0I am currently waiting to post on AO3.</b></p><p>After basketball practice, T.J. rushes to his locker to pull out his phone. He can\u2019t hold back the smile that tugs at his mouth when he sees the text from the contact name \u2018Underdog\u2019. He opens it up to see \u2018Hey, can you meet me, Andi, and Buffy at The Spoon after practice? It\u2019s the last school night before Hanukkah begins which is an especially busy time when you have four parents (I\u2019m definitely not ready to be psychoanalyzed like I am every year because I have therapist aunts and uncles too). Okay I\u2019ll stop rambling, but lmk if you can come.\u2019 His smile grows at the adorableness of the boy\u2019s rants. They had become increasingly common and he was hoping that it was because Cyrus was feeling the same feelings of affection that T.J. was feeling towards Cyrus.</p><p>Suddenly, his teammate\u2019s words pull him out of the clouds and back to earth. \u201cAw, what\u2019s Kippen all smiley about?\u201d Darren teases. T.J. instinctively puts his phone down and begins to wipe off his sweaty face with the towel in his locker.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably that Goodman kid,\u201d his friend Chris yells from the opposite side of the smelly locker room.</p><p>\u201cOooo, does T.J. have a girl?\u201d Darren coos causing T.J.\u2019s jaw to tense. Darren isn\u2019t exactly the most\u00a0\u201cwoke\u201d, and he doesn\u2019t always make the most sensitive comments. But T.J. doesn\u2019t want to hide himself from his teammates anymore.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWell, Cyrus is a boy and he\u2019s not mine,\u201d T.J. responds resentfully, \u201cSo no.\u201d</p><p>He expects Darren to make some insensitive comment, but he just throws his hands up defensively and says, \u201cLove who you love.\u201d</p><p>T.J. is about to speak when Chris runs up behind him and pats him on the back, \u201cDon\u2019t lie, Kippen. You want him to be yours, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay yes I do!\u201d he gives in, figuring it\u2019s impossible to hide at this point. \u201cHe\u2019s literally the best person on the planet, but he\u2019s not my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, is Cyrus that kid that comes to like every one of our games?\u201d Darren asks.</p><p>T.J. nods while feeling his cheeks heat up and says, \u201cHe\u2019s just a really supportive friend.\u201d</p><p>Chris rolls his eyes. \u201cDude,\u201d he says, \u201cLock that man down. He likes you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks man,\u201d T.J. replies, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be taking advice from your dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wound me, Kippen,\u201d Chris jokes, putting his hand to his heart and feigning heartbreak. \u201cAs your best friend I cannot sit here and watch you silently pine over a guy who obviously likes you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, I have to respond to him,\u201d T.J. replies, earning a laugh from both Darren and Chris. Darren picks up his backpack, closes his locker, and heads out the door with a wave to the other two.</p><p>T.J. pulls out his phone and opens his texts back up. He smiles again as he notices the heart emoji that Cyrus sent with his text, not noticing Chris who has begun reading Cyrus\u2019s message over his shoulder. T.J. begins to type a response, unable to hold himself back from using his own heart emojis.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all you two use way too many heart emojis in your conversations,\u201d Chris says, as T.J. jumps and moves his phone out of Chris\u2019s eyesight. \u201cSecond of all, you\u2019re meeting him at The Spoon? That\u2019s practically a date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a group thing,\u201d T.J. defends, \u201cAnd we hang out at The Spoon all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I don\u2019t send heart emojis to you,\u201d Chris says, \u201cAnd by the way, the double heart emoji is particularly bold, Kippen.\u201d</p><p>T.J. can\u2019t hide the blush that makes it\u2019s way onto his cheeks as he replies, \u201cWe just have a different friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Chris agrees. \u201cYou two have the friendship of two lovesick idiots who are too scared to make the first move\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse you,\u201d T.J. responds defensively, \u201cCyrus is very smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot if he can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re literally so whipped for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d T.J. says in a failed attempt to be nonchalant. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>T.J. runs to the sink to splash his face with water and style his hair a before he sees the other boy. He doesn\u2019t have time to take a shower so he douses himself with cologne, puts on deodorant, and throws his light blue basketball hoodie over his bare chest. He turns his attention to his hair again, still unsatisfied with the unkempt look of it. Chris notices and pulls his hands away from his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou look like fire, Kippen,\u201d he says with a reassuring smile and a friendly punch to his shoulder, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to keep him waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass,\u201d T.J. says playfully shoving Chris back as he goes to gather his stuff.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a gay dumbass,\u201d Chris responds, \u201cNow go get your man!\u201d</p><p>T.J. closes his locker and runs out the door of the locker room.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Cyrus and T.J. sit on one side of their usual booth at The Spoon as Andi and Buffy sit across from them. This configuration has become the norm for the group because no one dares to separate the boys from each other. As usual, Cyrus has a basket of baby taters in front of him, T.J. has his chocolate milkshake, and Andi and Buffy share their basket of baby taters. Occasionally, T.J. reaches and steals a baby tater from Cyrus claiming he was a \u2018tater thief\u2019. Cyrus playfully shoves his hand away from the basket (usually too late), but his wide smile gave away the fact that he was all too willing to share his delicious snack with the other boy. Andi and Buffy give each other a glance complete with playful eye rolls clearly noticing the obvious flirting between the two and the fact that they both seem completely oblivious to the other\u2019s affection. This particular day, T.J. has his arm slung casually over the back of the booth. It was a harmless enough action, but Buffy catches his eyes as he shifts his body towards the other boy and immediately looked away making his intent all too clear.</p><p>\u201cAny plans for the weekend?\u201d Andi asks the group.</p><p>\u201cMarty is taking me ice skating,\u201d Buffy says with a smile, \u201cdespite the fact that neither of us knows how to ice skate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you two will still find a way to make a competition out of it,\u201d Andi giggles and Buffy simply nods with an involuntary smile as she thinks of the charming brunette boy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cute!\u201d Cyrus squeals, \u201cI want someone to take me ice skating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Andi begins with a laugh, \u201cI love you, but there\u2019s a 99 percent chance you\u2019d fall and break every bone in your body\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could do it,\u201d T.J. responds defensively. \u201cHe just needs a proper teacher.\u201d</p><p>The girls pause and look at each other. Andi breaks the silence with, \u201cA teacher like you, T.J.?\u201d</p><p>T.J.\u2019s eyes go wide and he stutters, unable to form proper sentences. Noticing his panic, Buffy quickly changes the conversation by asking Cyrus to describe his trip to London.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, it was so cool,\u201d Cyrus starts, his eyes lighting up. T.J. shoots a grateful glance at Buffy before fixing his eyes back to Cyrus who has begun rambling about his experiences with attending West End theatre productions, admiring the London Eye from afar (because of course he wouldn\u2019t get on the \u2018giant ferris wheel of death\u2019 as he describes it), and \u2018being immersed\u2019 in the culture of the British people. He is halfway through a story about the parliamentary guards on horseback that he heard from his tour guide when the bell of The Spoon rings, signaling the arrival of a new customer. Buffy and Andi immediately shift their focus away from Cyrus, noticing the dimpled boy that has just walked through the door with a new girl by his side. Cyrus stops his story and looks at the girls across from him.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d Cyrus asks with a sigh. The girls nod as Andi looks particularly worried, and Cyrus accepts the fact that he won\u2019t be able to finish his story.</p><p>T.J., however, has not shifted his focus away from the dark haired boy. He sits still invested in the unfinished story that Cyrus had been telling before he lost two-thirds of his audience to the human equivalent of sunshine. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d T.J. asks, his voice laced with urgency and his eyes wide with anticipation. \u201cDid he ever call her?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s head turns to meet T.J.\u2019s eyes. Noticing the complete sincerity in T.J.\u2019s gaze, he begins to answer but is cut off yet again by Jonah excitedly greeting the group.</p><p>\u201cAndi,\u201d Jonah says, \u201cI have someone for you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Andi responds, her voice dripping with resentment. This boy just never stops picking up girls, does he?</p><p>T.J. immediately loses interest in the conversation, and notices Cyrus\u2019s uncharacteristic glare at Jonah. The jock clears his throat loudly drawing all the attention to himself.</p><p>\u201cGoodman and I actually have somewhere to be,\u201d T.J. says already rising from his seat. Cyrus simply nods affirmatively (but confused) and slides himself out of the booth, and the two exit the restaurant. Jonah watches them with a disappointed look on his face before sliding himself into the newly empty side of the booth with his new girl.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The boys walk in comfortable silence for a few moments. A chilling winter wind whips around them causing Cyrus to shiver and T.J. almost wraps his arm around the boy before realizing that would probably be weird. T.J. figures it\u2019s better to let Cyrus cool down a bit. He\u2019s unsure how to deal with an angry Cyrus because he\u2019s never seen him like this.</p><p>\u201cThanks for getting me out of there,\u201d Cyrus says finally. \u201cApparently no one can ever compete with Jonah Beck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your friend group,\u201d T.J. says truthfully, \u201cThat certainly seems to be the case.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods sadly, and T.J. wants nothing more than to reach out and grab the boy\u2019s hand to console him.</p><p>\u201cI mean I used to be okay with it back when\u2026\u201d Cyrus trails off, unsure if he\u2019s ready to share that part of his life with the boy beside him. He settles for, \u201cBut it\u2019s different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d T.J. asks, unable to hide his intrigue.</p><p>\u201cWell, I met you,\u201d Cyrus says, and before he can talk himself out of it he adds, \u201cAnd I no longer have a crush on Jonah.\u201d</p><p>T.J. smiles instinctively at the knowledge that he might have a chance, and Cyrus is scared to look at the boy, afraid of what his reaction might be. Historically, male jocks are not always the most accepting of people like Cyrus, but T.J is not like most of them. He has already proven that, and Cyrus hopes for a positive response.</p><p>\u201cAre those two things related?\u201d T.J. asks finally after composing himself.</p><p>Cyrus nearly trips because of his shock at T.J.\u2019s question. His breath catches in his throat as T.J. reaches out to save him from falling. T.J. can\u2019t help but chuckle at the flustered boy, and his fingers linger on Cyrus a bit longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cSo are they?\u201d T.J. asks again, curiosity eating away at him.</p><p>\u201cNo comment,\u201d Cyrus mutters, his face tinged pink with embarrassment.</p><p>T.J. nods, his heart suddenly beating out of control and a wide smile tugging at his lips. He just can\u2019t get enough of the beautiful boy next to him, and T.J. now knows he might actually have a chance.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d T.J. finally says, \u201cI like you better than Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus replies with a twinkle in his dark eyes, \u201cBut you seem to be the only one who thinks that. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>T.J. playfully nudges Cyrus as they continue to walk down the street.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Cyrus questions, realizing that they aren\u2019t going in the direction of the swings or either of his parents\u2019 houses.</p><p>\u201cMy place,\u201d T.J. replies, \u201cIf that\u2019s cool with you, of course.\u201d</p><p>T.J. is suddenly nervous to be inviting him over for the first time. He knows the other boy won\u2019t judge, but he can\u2019t help but be a little ashamed of the tiny apartment he lives in. He hasn\u2019t shared much of his family life with Cyrus or anyone for that matter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally,\u201d Cyrus responds. Of course he\u2019d be okay with it, T.J. doesn\u2019t know why his brain always second-guesses everything. It\u2019s just Cyrus. The only one who ever pushed enough for him to open up. The boy who inspired him to be a better person so he would be worthy of Cyrus\u2019s affections. The cutest boy alive. Oh god, he was gone. He\u2019s not even sure if it\u2019s just a crush anymore. He might just be fully in love with the dorky Jewish boy. Cyrus would be the easiest person to interact with, but T.J. often felt himself intimidated by the boy\u2019s intensely soft brown eyes and blinding smile.

But T.J. doesn\u2019t want to hide himself from his teammates anymore.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWell, Cyrus is a boy and he\u2019s not mine,\u201d T.J. responds resentfully, \u201cSo no.\u201d</p><p>He expects Darren to make some insensitive comment, but he just throws his hands up defensively and says, \u201cLove who you love.\u201d</p><p>T.J. is about to speak when Chris runs up behind him and pats him on the back, \u201cDon\u2019t lie, Kippen. You want him to be yours, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay yes I do!\u201d he gives in, figuring it\u2019s impossible to hide at this point. \u201cHe\u2019s literally the best person on the planet, but he\u2019s not my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, is Cyrus that kid that comes to like every one of our games?\u201d Darren asks.</p><p>T.J. nods while feeling his cheeks heat up and says, \u201cHe\u2019s just a really supportive friend.\u201d</p><p>Chris rolls his eyes. \u201cDude,\u201d he says, \u201cLock that man down. He likes you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks man,\u201d T.J. replies, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be taking advice from your dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wound me, Kippen,\u201d Chris jokes, putting his hand to his heart and feigning heartbreak. \u201cAs your best friend I cannot sit here and watch you silently pine over a guy who obviously likes you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, I have to respond to him,\u201d T.J. replies, earning a laugh from both Darren and Chris. Darren picks up his backpack, closes his locker, and heads out the door with a wave to the other two.</p><p>T.J. pulls out his phone and opens his texts back up. He smiles again as he notices the heart emoji that Cyrus sent with his text, not noticing Chris who has begun reading Cyrus\u2019s message over his shoulder. T.J. begins to type a response, unable to hold himself back from using his own heart emojis.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all you two use way too many heart emojis in your conversations,\u201d Chris says, as T.J. jumps and moves his phone out of Chris\u2019s eyesight. \u201cSecond of all, you\u2019re meeting him at The Spoon? That\u2019s practically a date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a group thing,\u201d T.J. defends, \u201cAnd we hang out at The Spoon all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I don\u2019t send heart emojis to you,\u201d Chris says, \u201cAnd by the way, the double heart emoji is particularly bold, Kippen.\u201d</p><p>T.J. can\u2019t hide the blush that makes it\u2019s way onto his cheeks as he replies, \u201cWe just have a different friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Chris agrees. \u201cYou two have the friendship of two lovesick idiots who are too scared to make the first move\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse you,\u201d T.J. responds defensively, \u201cCyrus is very smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot if he can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re literally so whipped for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d T.J. says in a failed attempt to be nonchalant. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>T.J. runs to the sink to splash his face with water and style his hair a before he sees the other boy. He doesn\u2019t have time to take a shower so he douses himself with cologne, puts on deodorant, and throws his light blue basketball hoodie over his bare chest. He turns his attention to his hair again, still unsatisfied with the unkempt look of it. Chris notices and pulls his hands away from his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou look like fire, Kippen,\u201d he says with a reassuring smile and a friendly punch to his shoulder, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to keep him waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass,\u201d T.J. says playfully shoving Chris back as he goes to gather his stuff.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a gay dumbass,\u201d Chris responds, \u201cNow go get your man!\u201d</p><p>T.J. closes his locker and runs out the door of the locker room.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Cyrus and T.J. sit on one side of their usual booth at The Spoon as Andi and Buffy sit across from them. This configuration has become the norm for the group because no one dares to separate the boys from each other. As usual, Cyrus has a basket of baby taters in front of him, T.J. has his chocolate milkshake, and Andi and Buffy share their basket of baby taters. Occasionally, T.J. reaches and steals a baby tater from Cyrus claiming he was a \u2018tater thief\u2019. Cyrus playfully shoves his hand away from the basket (usually too late), but his wide smile gave away the fact that he was all too willing to share his delicious snack with the other boy. Andi and Buffy give each other a glance complete with playful eye rolls clearly noticing the obvious flirting between the two and the fact that they both seem completely oblivious to the other\u2019s affection. This particular day, T.J. has his arm slung casually over the back of the booth. It was a harmless enough action, but Buffy catches his eyes as he shifts his body towards the other boy and immediately looked away making his intent all too clear.</p><p>\u201cAny plans for the weekend?\u201d Andi asks the group.</p><p>\u201cMarty is taking me ice skating,\u201d Buffy says with a smile, \u201cdespite the fact that neither of us knows how to ice skate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you two will still find a way to make a competition out of it,\u201d Andi giggles and Buffy simply nods with an involuntary smile as she thinks of the charming brunette boy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cute!\u201d Cyrus squeals, \u201cI want someone to take me ice skating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Andi begins with a laugh, \u201cI love you, but there\u2019s a 99 percent chance you\u2019d fall and break every bone in your body\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could do it,\u201d T.J. responds defensively. \u201cHe just needs a proper teacher.\u201d</p><p>The girls pause and look at each other. Andi breaks the silence with, \u201cA teacher like you, T.J.?\u201d</p><p>T.J.\u2019s eyes go wide and he stutters, unable to form proper sentences. Noticing his panic, Buffy quickly changes the conversation by asking Cyrus to describe his trip to London.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, it was so cool,\u201d Cyrus starts, his eyes lighting up. T.J. shoots a grateful glance at Buffy before fixing his eyes back to Cyrus who has begun rambling about his experiences with attending West End theatre productions, admiring the London Eye from afar (because of course he wouldn\u2019t get on the \u2018giant ferris wheel of death\u2019 as he describes it), and \u2018being immersed\u2019 in the culture of the British people. He is halfway through a story about the parliamentary guards on horseback that he heard from his tour guide when the bell of The Spoon rings, signaling the arrival of a new customer. Buffy and Andi immediately shift their focus away from Cyrus, noticing the dimpled boy that has just walked through the door with a new girl by his side. Cyrus stops his story and looks at the girls across from him.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d Cyrus asks with a sigh. The girls nod as Andi looks particularly worried, and Cyrus accepts the fact that he won\u2019t be able to finish his story.</p><p>T.J., however, has not shifted his focus away from the dark haired boy. He sits still invested in the unfinished story that Cyrus had been telling before he lost two-thirds of his audience to the human equivalent of sunshine. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d T.J. asks, his voice laced with urgency and his eyes wide with anticipation. \u201cDid he ever call her?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s head turns to meet T.J.\u2019s eyes. Noticing the complete sincerity in T.J.\u2019s gaze, he begins to answer but is cut off yet again by Jonah excitedly greeting the group.</p><p>\u201cAndi,\u201d Jonah says, \u201cI have someone for you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Andi responds, her voice dripping with resentment. This boy just never stops picking up girls, does he?</p><p>T.J. immediately loses interest in the conversation, and notices Cyrus\u2019s uncharacteristic glare at Jonah. The jock clears his throat loudly drawing all the attention to himself.</p><p>\u201cGoodman and I actually have somewhere to be,\u201d T.J. says already rising from his seat. Cyrus simply nods affirmatively (but confused) and slides himself out of the booth, and the two exit the restaurant. Jonah watches them with a disappointed look on his face before sliding himself into the newly empty side of the booth with his new girl.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The boys walk in comfortable silence for a few moments. A chilling winter wind whips around them causing Cyrus to shiver and T.J. almost wraps his arm around the boy before realizing that would probably be weird. T.J. figures it\u2019s better to let Cyrus cool down a bit. He\u2019s unsure how to deal with an angry Cyrus because he\u2019s never seen him like this.</p><p>\u201cThanks for getting me out of there,\u201d Cyrus says finally. \u201cApparently no one can ever compete with Jonah Beck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your friend group,\u201d T.J. says truthfully, \u201cThat certainly seems to be the case.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods sadly, and T.J. wants nothing more than to reach out and grab the boy\u2019s hand to console him.</p><p>\u201cI mean I used to be okay with it back when\u2026\u201d Cyrus trails off, unsure if he\u2019s ready to share that part of his life with the boy beside him. He settles for, \u201cBut it\u2019s different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d T.J. asks, unable to hide his intrigue.</p><p>\u201cWell, I met you,\u201d Cyrus says, and before he can talk himself out of it he adds, \u201cAnd I no longer have a crush on Jonah.\u201d</p><p>T.J. smiles instinctively at the knowledge that he might have a chance, and Cyrus is scared to look at the boy, afraid of what his reaction might be. Historically, male jocks are not always the most accepting of people like Cyrus, but T.J is not like most of them. He has already proven that, and Cyrus hopes for a positive response.</p><p>\u201cAre those two things related?\u201d T.J. asks finally after composing himself.</p><p>Cyrus nearly trips because of his shock at T.J.\u2019s question. His breath catches in his throat as T.J. reaches out to save him from falling. T.J. can\u2019t help but chuckle at the flustered boy, and his fingers linger on Cyrus a bit longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cSo are they?\u201d T.J. asks again, curiosity eating away at him.</p><p>\u201cNo comment,\u201d Cyrus mutters, his face tinged pink with embarrassment.</p><p>T.J. nods, his heart suddenly beating out of control and a wide smile tugging at his lips. He just can\u2019t get enough of the beautiful boy next to him, and T.J. now knows he might actually have a chance.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d T.J. finally says, \u201cI like you better than Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus replies with a twinkle in his dark eyes, \u201cBut you seem to be the only one who thinks that. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>T.J. playfully nudges Cyrus as they continue to walk down the street.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Cyrus questions, realizing that they aren\u2019t going in the direction of the swings or either of his parents\u2019 houses.</p><p>\u201cMy place,\u201d T.J. replies, \u201cIf that\u2019s cool with you, of course.\u201d</p><p>T.J. is suddenly nervous to be inviting him over for the first time. He knows the other boy won\u2019t judge, but he can\u2019t help but be a little ashamed of the tiny apartment he lives in. He hasn\u2019t shared much of his family life with Cyrus or anyone for that matter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally,\u201d Cyrus responds. Of course he\u2019d be okay with it, T.J. doesn\u2019t know why his brain always second-guesses everything. It\u2019s just Cyrus. The only one who ever pushed enough for him to open up. The boy who inspired him to be a better person so he would be worthy of Cyrus\u2019s affections. The cutest boy alive. Oh god, he was gone. He\u2019s not even sure if it\u2019s just a crush anymore. He might just be fully in love with the dorky Jewish boy. Cyrus would be the easiest person to interact with, but T.J. often felt himself intimidated by the boy\u2019s intensely soft brown eyes and blinding smile. He is unfairly beautiful, and T.J. is struck with the unbearable urge to come out to Cyrus. He hopes that the other boy will make a move and he\u2019ll be saved the heartbreak and embarrassment of his feelings potentially being unrequited.</p><p>In a not-so-smooth manner, T.J. just blurts out, \u201cSo, boys, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chuckles, \u201cYeah, you know there\u2019s a word for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d T.J. laughs as he nervously wipes his clammy hands on his jeans. \u201cIt also describes me. Me\u2014gay. Um, I like boys as well.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stops, his mouth hung open in shock. T.J. turns to face him and finds Cyrus throwing his arms around his neck and pulling him down into a tight hug. After processing his initial surprise at the sudden affection, his arms wrap around the boy\u2019s waist. T.J. nearly melts, and hopes that he can stay there with him forever, but Cyrus eventually pulls away.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Cyrus says looking down at his feet. T.J. can just barely make out a faint pink tint to his cheeks, but he convinces himself that it\u2019s just from the chilling winter air.</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize,\u201d T.J. assures him . \u201cYou seemed a bit surprised. Have I done anything to suggest heterosexuality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a basketball player?\u201d Cyrus answers nearly immediately.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, stereotypes. Can gay men not be athletic?\u201d T.J. says. It\u2019s almost playful, but there is a bit of an edge to his voice that suggests he is slightly offended.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I know,\u201d Cyrus assures him. \u201cI\u2019m not questioning you or anything, I just didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just playing. It\u2019s all good.\u201d T.J. says reassuringly.</p><p>The boys walk a bit in silence. They\u2019re both in awe of what just happened, but somehow more comfortable with each other than they\u2019ve ever been despite their racing hearts and minds.</p><p>\u201cAt least now I know why you tear up at <i>Love, Simon</i>,\u201d Cyrus teases.</p><p>\u201cAny one who doesn\u2019t is a heartless monster,\u201d T.J. shouts passionately. Cyrus knows he\u2019s dead serious, but he can\u2019t help but giggle at the jock\u2019s sudden outburst. T.J. is actually just a big, soft teddy bear, despite the bully persona that he often gives off to others his age.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Cyrus begins, a bright and curious smile forming on his face, \u201cDo you have a crush on anyone at the moment?\u201d</p><p>At this, T.J.\u2019s cheeks heat up and he resists the urge to just shout \u2018You! You idiot!\u2019 and run away from his issues. Instead he says, \u201cTime to go to my place,\u201d and turns on his heels, thus avoiding his issues in a different way.</p><p>Cyrus chuckles and follows the boy. He\u2019s not going to pressure T.J., even though curiosity eats away at him and he\u2019s way too nervous to tell the other boy how he feels, at least at the moment.

He can\u2019t hold back the smile that tugs at his mouth when he sees the text from the contact name \u2018Underdog\u2019. He opens it up to see \u2018Hey, can you meet me, Andi, and Buffy at The Spoon after practice? It\u2019s the last school night before Hanukkah begins which is an especially busy time when you have four parents (I\u2019m definitely not ready to be psychoanalyzed like I am every year because I have therapist aunts and uncles too). Okay I\u2019ll stop rambling, but lmk if you can come.\u2019 His smile grows at the adorableness of the boy\u2019s rants. They had become increasingly common and he was hoping that it was because Cyrus was feeling the same feelings of affection that T.J. was feeling towards Cyrus.</p><p>Suddenly, his teammate\u2019s words pull him out of the clouds and back to earth. \u201cAw, what\u2019s Kippen all smiley about?\u201d Darren teases. T.J. instinctively puts his phone down and begins to wipe off his sweaty face with the towel in his locker.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably that Goodman kid,\u201d his friend Chris yells from the opposite side of the smelly locker room.</p><p>\u201cOooo, does T.J. have a girl?\u201d Darren coos causing T.J.\u2019s jaw to tense. Darren isn\u2019t exactly the most\u00a0\u201cwoke\u201d, and he doesn\u2019t always make the most sensitive comments. But T.J. doesn\u2019t want to hide himself from his teammates anymore.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWell, Cyrus is a boy and he\u2019s not mine,\u201d T.J. responds resentfully, \u201cSo no.\u201d</p><p>He expects Darren to make some insensitive comment, but he just throws his hands up defensively and says, \u201cLove who you love.\u201d</p><p>T.J. is about to speak when Chris runs up behind him and pats him on the back, \u201cDon\u2019t lie, Kippen. You want him to be yours, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay yes I do!\u201d he gives in, figuring it\u2019s impossible to hide at this point. \u201cHe\u2019s literally the best person on the planet, but he\u2019s not my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, is Cyrus that kid that comes to like every one of our games?\u201d Darren asks.</p><p>T.J. nods while feeling his cheeks heat up and says, \u201cHe\u2019s just a really supportive friend.\u201d</p><p>Chris rolls his eyes. \u201cDude,\u201d he says, \u201cLock that man down. He likes you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks man,\u201d T.J. replies, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be taking advice from your dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wound me, Kippen,\u201d Chris jokes, putting his hand to his heart and feigning heartbreak. \u201cAs your best friend I cannot sit here and watch you silently pine over a guy who obviously likes you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, I have to respond to him,\u201d T.J. replies, earning a laugh from both Darren and Chris. Darren picks up his backpack, closes his locker, and heads out the door with a wave to the other two.</p><p>T.J. pulls out his phone and opens his texts back up. He smiles again as he notices the heart emoji that Cyrus sent with his text, not noticing Chris who has begun reading Cyrus\u2019s message over his shoulder. T.J. begins to type a response, unable to hold himself back from using his own heart emojis.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all you two use way too many heart emojis in your conversations,\u201d Chris says, as T.J. jumps and moves his phone out of Chris\u2019s eyesight. \u201cSecond of all, you\u2019re meeting him at The Spoon? That\u2019s practically a date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a group thing,\u201d T.J. defends, \u201cAnd we hang out at The Spoon all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I don\u2019t send heart emojis to you,\u201d Chris says, \u201cAnd by the way, the double heart emoji is particularly bold, Kippen.\u201d</p><p>T.J. can\u2019t hide the blush that makes it\u2019s way onto his cheeks as he replies, \u201cWe just have a different friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Chris agrees. \u201cYou two have the friendship of two lovesick idiots who are too scared to make the first move\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse you,\u201d T.J. responds defensively, \u201cCyrus is very smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot if he can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re literally so whipped for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d T.J. says in a failed attempt to be nonchalant. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>T.J. runs to the sink to splash his face with water and style his hair a before he sees the other boy. He doesn\u2019t have time to take a shower so he douses himself with cologne, puts on deodorant, and throws his light blue basketball hoodie over his bare chest. He turns his attention to his hair again, still unsatisfied with the unkempt look of it. Chris notices and pulls his hands away from his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou look like fire, Kippen,\u201d he says with a reassuring smile and a friendly punch to his shoulder, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to keep him waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dumbass,\u201d T.J. says playfully shoving Chris back as he goes to gather his stuff.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a gay dumbass,\u201d Chris responds, \u201cNow go get your man!\u201d</p><p>T.J. closes his locker and runs out the door of the locker room.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Cyrus and T.J. sit on one side of their usual booth at The Spoon as Andi and Buffy sit across from them. This configuration has become the norm for the group because no one dares to separate the boys from each other. As usual, Cyrus has a basket of baby taters in front of him, T.J. has his chocolate milkshake, and Andi and Buffy share their basket of baby taters. Occasionally, T.J. reaches and steals a baby tater from Cyrus claiming he was a \u2018tater thief\u2019. Cyrus playfully shoves his hand away from the basket (usually too late), but his wide smile gave away the fact that he was all too willing to share his delicious snack with the other boy. Andi and Buffy give each other a glance complete with playful eye rolls clearly noticing the obvious flirting between the two and the fact that they both seem completely oblivious to the other\u2019s affection. This particular day, T.J. has his arm slung casually over the back of the booth. It was a harmless enough action, but Buffy catches his eyes as he shifts his body towards the other boy and immediately looked away making his intent all too clear.</p><p>\u201cAny plans for the weekend?\u201d Andi asks the group.</p><p>\u201cMarty is taking me ice skating,\u201d Buffy says with a smile, \u201cdespite the fact that neither of us knows how to ice skate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you two will still find a way to make a competition out of it,\u201d Andi giggles and Buffy simply nods with an involuntary smile as she thinks of the charming brunette boy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cute!\u201d Cyrus squeals, \u201cI want someone to take me ice skating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Andi begins with a laugh, \u201cI love you, but there\u2019s a 99 percent chance you\u2019d fall and break every bone in your body\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could do it,\u201d T.J. responds defensively. \u201cHe just needs a proper teacher.\u201d</p><p>The girls pause and look at each other. Andi breaks the silence with, \u201cA teacher like you, T.J.?\u201d</p><p>T.J.\u2019s eyes go wide and he stutters, unable to form proper sentences. Noticing his panic, Buffy quickly changes the conversation by asking Cyrus to describe his trip to London.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, it was so cool,\u201d Cyrus starts, his eyes lighting up. T.J. shoots a grateful glance at Buffy before fixing his eyes back to Cyrus who has begun rambling about his experiences with attending West End theatre productions, admiring the London Eye from afar (because of course he wouldn\u2019t get on the \u2018giant ferris wheel of death\u2019 as he describes it), and \u2018being immersed\u2019 in the culture of the British people. He is halfway through a story about the parliamentary guards on horseback that he heard from his tour guide when the bell of The Spoon rings, signaling the arrival of a new customer. Buffy and Andi immediately shift their focus away from Cyrus, noticing the dimpled boy that has just walked through the door with a new girl by his side. Cyrus stops his story and looks at the girls across from him.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d Cyrus asks with a sigh. The girls nod as Andi looks particularly worried, and Cyrus accepts the fact that he won\u2019t be able to finish his story.</p><p>T.J., however, has not shifted his focus away from the dark haired boy. He sits still invested in the unfinished story that Cyrus had been telling before he lost two-thirds of his audience to the human equivalent of sunshine. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d T.J. asks, his voice laced with urgency and his eyes wide with anticipation. \u201cDid he ever call her?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s head turns to meet T.J.\u2019s eyes. Noticing the complete sincerity in T.J.\u2019s gaze, he begins to answer but is cut off yet again by Jonah excitedly greeting the group.</p><p>\u201cAndi,\u201d Jonah says, \u201cI have someone for you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Andi responds, her voice dripping with resentment. This boy just never stops picking up girls, does he?</p><p>T.J. immediately loses interest in the conversation, and notices Cyrus\u2019s uncharacteristic glare at Jonah. The jock clears his throat loudly drawing all the attention to himself.</p><p>\u201cGoodman and I actually have somewhere to be,\u201d T.J. says already rising from his seat. Cyrus simply nods affirmatively (but confused) and slides himself out of the booth, and the two exit the restaurant. Jonah watches them with a disappointed look on his face before sliding himself into the newly empty side of the booth with his new girl.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The boys walk in comfortable silence for a few moments. A chilling winter wind whips around them causing Cyrus to shiver and T.J. almost wraps his arm around the boy before realizing that would probably be weird. T.J. figures it\u2019s better to let Cyrus cool down a bit. He\u2019s unsure how to deal with an angry Cyrus because he\u2019s never seen him like this.</p><p>\u201cThanks for getting me out of there,\u201d Cyrus says finally. \u201cApparently no one can ever compete with Jonah Beck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your friend group,\u201d T.J. says truthfully, \u201cThat certainly seems to be the case.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods sadly, and T.J. wants nothing more than to reach out and grab the boy\u2019s hand to console him.</p><p>\u201cI mean I used to be okay with it back when\u2026\u201d Cyrus trails off, unsure if he\u2019s ready to share that part of his life with the boy beside him. He settles for, \u201cBut it\u2019s different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d T.J. asks, unable to hide his intrigue.</p><p>\u201cWell, I met you,\u201d Cyrus says, and before he can talk himself out of it he adds, \u201cAnd I no longer have a crush on Jonah.\u201d</p><p>T.J. smiles instinctively at the knowledge that he might have a chance, and Cyrus is scared to look at the boy, afraid of what his reaction might be. Historically, male jocks are not always the most accepting of people like Cyrus, but T.J is not like most of them. He has already proven that, and Cyrus hopes for a positive response.</p><p>\u201cAre those two things related?\u201d T.J. asks finally after composing himself.</p><p>Cyrus nearly trips because of his shock at T.J.\u2019s question. His breath catches in his throat as T.J. reaches out to save him from falling. T.J. can\u2019t help but chuckle at the flustered boy, and his fingers linger on Cyrus a bit longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cSo are they?\u201d T.J. asks again, curiosity eating away at him.</p><p>\u201cNo comment,\u201d Cyrus mutters, his face tinged pink with embarrassment.</p><p>T.J. nods, his heart suddenly beating out of control and a wide smile tugging at his lips. He just can\u2019t get enough of the beautiful boy next to him, and T.J. now knows he might actually have a chance.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d T.J. finally says, \u201cI like you better than Jonah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus replies with a twinkle in his dark eyes, \u201cBut you seem to be the only one who thinks that. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>T.J. playfully nudges Cyrus as they continue to walk down the street.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Cyrus questions, realizing that they aren\u2019t going in the direction of the swings or either of his parents\u2019 houses.</p><p>\u201cMy place,\u201d T.J. replies, \u201cIf that\u2019s cool with you, of course.\u201d</p><p>T.J. is suddenly nervous to be inviting him over for the first time. He knows the other boy won\u2019t judge, but he can\u2019t help but be a little ashamed of the tiny apartment he lives in. He hasn\u2019t shared much of his family life with Cyrus or anyone for that matter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally,\u201d Cyrus responds. Of course he\u2019d be okay with it, T.J. doesn\u2019t know why his brain always second-guesses everything. It\u2019s just Cyrus. The only one who ever pushed enough for him to open up. The boy who inspired him to be a better person so he would be worthy of Cyrus\u2019s affections. The cutest boy alive. Oh god, he was gone. He\u2019s not even sure if it\u2019s just a crush anymore. He might just be fully in love with the dorky Jewish boy. Cyrus would be the easiest person to interact with, but T.J. often felt himself intimidated by the boy\u2019s intensely soft brown eyes and blinding smile. He is unfairly beautiful, and T.J. is struck with the unbearable urge to come out to Cyrus. He hopes that the other boy will make a move and he\u2019ll be saved the heartbreak and embarrassment of his feelings potentially being unrequited.</p><p>In a not-so-smooth manner, T.J. just blurts out, \u201cSo, boys, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chuckles, \u201cYeah, you know there\u2019s a word for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d T.J. laughs as he nervously wipes his clammy hands on his jeans. \u201cIt also describes me. Me\u2014gay. Um, I like boys as well.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stops, his mouth hung open in shock. T.J. turns to face him and finds Cyrus throwing his arms around his neck and pulling him down into a tight hug. After processing his initial surprise at the sudden affection, his arms wrap around the boy\u2019s waist. T.J. nearly melts, and hopes that he can stay there with him forever, but Cyrus eventually pulls away.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Cyrus says looking down at his feet. T.J. can just barely make out a faint pink tint to his cheeks, but he convinces himself that it\u2019s just from the chilling winter air.</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize,\u201d T.J. assures him . \u201cYou seemed a bit surprised. Have I done anything to suggest heterosexuality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a basketball player?\u201d Cyrus answers nearly immediately.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, stereotypes. Can gay men not be athletic?\u201d T.J. says. It\u2019s almost playful, but there is a bit of an edge to his voice that suggests he is slightly offended.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I know,\u201d Cyrus assures him. \u201cI\u2019m not questioning you or anything, I just didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just playing. It\u2019s all good.\u201d T.J. says reassuringly.</p><p>The boys walk a bit in silence. They\u2019re both in awe of what just happened, but somehow more comfortable with each other than they\u2019ve ever been despite their racing hearts and minds.</p><p>\u201cAt least now I know why you tear up at <i>Love, Simon</i>,\u201d Cyrus teases.</p><p>\u201cAny one who doesn\u2019t is a heartless monster,\u201d T.J. shouts passionately. Cyrus knows he\u2019s dead serious, but he can\u2019t help but giggle at the jock\u2019s sudden outburst. T.J. is actually just a big, soft teddy bear, despite the bully persona that he often gives off to others his age.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Cyrus begins, a bright and curious smile forming on his face, \u201cDo you have a crush on anyone at the moment?\u201d</p><p>At this, T.J.\u2019s cheeks heat up and he resists the urge to just shout \u2018You! You idiot!\u2019 and run away from his issues. Instead he says, \u201cTime to go to my place,\u201d and turns on his heels, thus avoiding his issues in a different way.</p><p>Cyrus chuckles and follows the boy. He\u2019s not going to pressure T.J., even though curiosity eats away at him and he\u2019s way too nervous to tell the other boy how he feels, at least at the moment. When he catches up, he walks beside T.J. with their hands brushing occasionally, sending warmth up his arm and causing an involuntary smile on his face.</p><p>\u2019T.J. Kippen is gay!\u2019 He thinks to himself with a smile. \u2018Maybe I have a chance!\u2019</p>",

Chris notices and pulls his hands away from his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;You look like fire, Kippen,&rdquo; he says with a reassuring smile and a friendly punch to his shoulder, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want to keep him waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dumbass,&rdquo; T.J. says playfully shoving Chris back as he goes to gather his stuff.</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a gay dumbass,&rdquo; Chris responds, &ldquo;Now go get your man!&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. closes his locker and runs out the door of the locker room.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Cyrus and T.J. sit on one side of their usual booth at The Spoon as Andi and Buffy sit across from them. This configuration has become the norm for the group because no one dares to separate the boys from each other. As usual, Cyrus has a basket of baby taters in front of him, T.J. has his chocolate milkshake, and Andi and Buffy share their basket of baby taters. Occasionally, T.J. reaches and steals a baby tater from Cyrus claiming he was a &lsquo;tater thief&rsquo;. Cyrus playfully shoves his hand away from the basket (usually too late), but his wide smile gave away the fact that he was all too willing to share his delicious snack with the other boy. Andi and Buffy give each other a glance complete with playful eye rolls clearly noticing the obvious flirting between the two and the fact that they both seem completely oblivious to the other&rsquo;s affection. This particular day, T.J. has his arm slung casually over the back of the booth. It was a harmless enough action, but Buffy catches his eyes as he shifts his body towards the other boy and immediately looked away making his intent all too clear.</p><p>&ldquo;Any plans for the weekend?&rdquo; Andi asks the group.</p><p>&ldquo;Marty is taking me ice skating,&rdquo; Buffy says with a smile, &ldquo;despite the fact that neither of us knows how to ice skate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you two will still find a way to make a competition out of it,&rdquo; Andi giggles and Buffy simply nods with an involuntary smile as she thinks of the charming brunette boy.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cute!&rdquo; Cyrus squeals, &ldquo;I want someone to take me ice skating.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; Andi begins with a laugh, &ldquo;I love you, but there&rsquo;s a 99 percent chance you&rsquo;d fall and break every bone in your body&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He could do it,&rdquo; T.J. responds defensively. &ldquo;He just needs a proper teacher.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls pause and look at each other. Andi breaks the silence with, &ldquo;A teacher like you, T.J.?&rdquo;</p><p>T.J.&rsquo;s eyes go wide and he stutters, unable to form proper sentences. Noticing his panic, Buffy quickly changes the conversation by asking Cyrus to describe his trip to London.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my gosh, it was so cool,&rdquo; Cyrus starts, his eyes lighting up. T.J. shoots a grateful glance at Buffy before fixing his eyes back to Cyrus who has begun rambling about his experiences with attending West End theatre productions, admiring the London Eye from afar (because of course he wouldn&rsquo;t get on the &lsquo;giant ferris wheel of death&rsquo; as he describes it), and &lsquo;being immersed&rsquo; in the culture of the British people. He is halfway through a story about the parliamentary guards on horseback that he heard from his tour guide when the bell of The Spoon rings, signaling the arrival of a new customer. Buffy and Andi immediately shift their focus away from Cyrus, noticing the dimpled boy that has just walked through the door with a new girl by his side. Cyrus stops his story and looks at the girls across from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Jonah?&rdquo; Cyrus asks with a sigh. The girls nod as Andi looks particularly worried, and Cyrus accepts the fact that he won&rsquo;t be able to finish his story.</p><p>T.J., however, has not shifted his focus away from the dark haired boy. He sits still invested in the unfinished story that Cyrus had been telling before he lost two-thirds of his audience to the human equivalent of sunshine. &ldquo;So what happened?&rdquo; T.J. asks, his voice laced with urgency and his eyes wide with anticipation. &ldquo;Did he ever call her?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo;s head turns to meet T.J.&rsquo;s eyes. Noticing the complete sincerity in T.J.&rsquo;s gaze, he begins to answer but is cut off yet again by Jonah excitedly greeting the group.</p><p>&ldquo;Andi,&rdquo; Jonah says, &ldquo;I have someone for you to meet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can see that,&rdquo; Andi responds, her voice dripping with resentment. This boy just never stops picking up girls, does he?</p><p>T.J. immediately loses interest in the conversation, and notices Cyrus&rsquo;s uncharacteristic glare at Jonah. The jock clears his throat loudly drawing all the attention to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodman and I actually have somewhere to be,&rdquo; T.J. says already rising from his seat. Cyrus simply nods affirmatively (but confused) and slides himself out of the booth, and the two exit the restaurant. Jonah watches them with a disappointed look on his face before sliding himself into the newly empty side of the booth with his new girl.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>The boys walk in comfortable silence for a few moments. A chilling winter wind whips around them causing Cyrus to shiver and T.J. almost wraps his arm around the boy before realizing that would probably be weird. T.J. figures it&rsquo;s better to let Cyrus cool down a bit. He&rsquo;s unsure how to deal with an angry Cyrus because he&rsquo;s never seen him like this.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for getting me out of there,&rdquo; Cyrus says finally. &ldquo;Apparently no one can ever compete with Jonah Beck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In your friend group,&rdquo; T.J. says truthfully, &ldquo;That certainly seems to be the case.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nods sadly, and T.J. wants nothing more than to reach out and grab the boy&rsquo;s hand to console him.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean I used to be okay with it back when&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus trails off, unsure if he&rsquo;s ready to share that part of his life with the boy beside him. He settles for, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s different now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What changed?&rdquo; T.J. asks, unable to hide his intrigue.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I met you,&rdquo; Cyrus says, and before he can talk himself out of it he adds, &ldquo;And I no longer have a crush on Jonah.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. smiles instinctively at the knowledge that he might have a chance, and Cyrus is scared to look at the boy, afraid of what his reaction might be. Historically, male jocks are not always the most accepting of people like Cyrus, but T.J is not like most of them. He has already proven that, and Cyrus hopes for a positive response.</p><p>&ldquo;Are those two things related?&rdquo; T.J. asks finally after composing himself.</p><p>Cyrus nearly trips because of his shock at T.J.&rsquo;s question. His breath catches in his throat as T.J. reaches out to save him from falling. T.J. can&rsquo;t help but chuckle at the flustered boy, and his fingers linger on Cyrus a bit longer than necessary.</p><p>&ldquo;So are they?&rdquo; T.J. asks again, curiosity eating away at him.</p><p>&ldquo;No comment,&rdquo; Cyrus mutters, his face tinged pink with embarrassment.</p><p>T.J. nods, his heart suddenly beating out of control and a wide smile tugging at his lips. He just can&rsquo;t get enough of the beautiful boy next to him, and T.J. now knows he might actually have a chance.</p><p>&ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s worth,&rdquo; T.J. finally says, &ldquo;I like you better than Jonah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Cyrus replies with a twinkle in his dark eyes, &ldquo;But you seem to be the only one who thinks that. But thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. playfully nudges Cyrus as they continue to walk down the street.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Cyrus questions, realizing that they aren&rsquo;t going in the direction of the swings or either of his parents&rsquo; houses.</p><p>&ldquo;My place,&rdquo; T.J. replies, &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s cool with you, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>T.J. is suddenly nervous to be inviting him over for the first time. He knows the other boy won&rsquo;t judge, but he can&rsquo;t help but be a little ashamed of the tiny apartment he lives in. He hasn&rsquo;t shared much of his family life with Cyrus or anyone for that matter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, totally,&rdquo; Cyrus responds. Of course he&rsquo;d be okay with it, T.J. doesn&rsquo;t know why his brain always second-guesses everything. It&rsquo;s just Cyrus. The only one who ever pushed enough for him to open up. The boy who inspired him to be a better person so he would be worthy of Cyrus&rsquo;s affections. The cutest boy alive. Oh god, he was gone. He&rsquo;s not even sure if it&rsquo;s just a crush anymore. He might just be fully in love with the dorky Jewish boy. Cyrus would be the easiest person to interact with, but T.J. often felt himself intimidated by the boy&rsquo;s intensely soft brown eyes and blinding smile. He is unfairly beautiful, and T.J. is struck with the unbearable urge to come out to Cyrus. He hopes that the other boy will make a move and he&rsquo;ll be saved the heartbreak and embarrassment of his feelings potentially being unrequited.</p><p>In a not-so-smooth manner, T.J. just blurts out, &ldquo;So, boys, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus chuckles, &ldquo;Yeah, you know there&rsquo;s a word for that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; T.J. laughs as he nervously wipes his clammy hands on his jeans. &ldquo;It also describes me. Me&mdash;gay. Um, I like boys as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus stops, his mouth hung open in shock. T.J. turns to face him and finds Cyrus throwing his arms around his neck and pulling him down into a tight hug. After processing his initial surprise at the sudden affection, his arms wrap around the boy&rsquo;s waist. T.J. nearly melts, and hopes that he can stay there with him forever, but Cyrus eventually pulls away.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Cyrus says looking down at his feet. T.J. can just barely make out a faint pink tint to his cheeks, but he convinces himself that it&rsquo;s just from the chilling winter air.</p><p>&ldquo;No need to apologize,&rdquo; T.J. assures him . &ldquo;You seemed a bit surprised. Have I done anything to suggest heterosexuality?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a basketball player?&rdquo; Cyrus answers nearly immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, stereotypes. Can gay men not be athletic?&rdquo; T.J. says. It&rsquo;s almost playful, but there is a bit of an edge to his voice that suggests he is slightly offended.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I know,&rdquo; Cyrus assures him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not questioning you or anything, I just didn&rsquo;t expect it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was just playing. It&rsquo;s all good.&rdquo; T.J. says reassuringly.</p><p>The boys walk a bit in silence. They&rsquo;re both in awe of what just happened, but somehow more comfortable with each other than they&rsquo;ve ever been despite their racing hearts and minds.</p><p>&ldquo;At least now I know why you tear up at <i>Love, Simon</i>,&rdquo; Cyrus teases.</p><p>&ldquo;Any one who doesn&rsquo;t is a heartless monster,&rdquo; T.J. shouts passionately. Cyrus knows he&rsquo;s dead serious, but he can&rsquo;t help but giggle at the jock&rsquo;s sudden outburst. T.J. is actually just a big, soft teddy bear, despite the bully persona that he often gives off to others his age.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Cyrus begins, a bright and curious smile forming on his face, &ldquo;Do you have a crush on anyone at the moment?&rdquo;</p><p>At this, T.J.&rsquo;s cheeks heat up and he resists the urge to just shout &lsquo;You! You idiot!&rsquo; and run away from his issues. Instead he says, &ldquo;Time to go to my place,&rdquo; and turns on his heels, thus avoiding his issues in a different way.</p><p>Cyrus chuckles and follows the boy. He&rsquo;s not going to pressure T.J., even though curiosity eats away at him and he&rsquo;s way too nervous to tell the other boy how he feels, at least at the moment. When he catches up, he walks beside T.J. with their hands brushing occasionally, sending warmth up his arm and causing an involuntary smile on his face.</p><p>&rsquo;T.J. Kippen is gay!&rsquo; He thinks to himself with a smile. &lsquo;Maybe I have a chance!&rsquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Note: This is my first attempt at a chaptered fic. It&rsquo;s mostly canon compliant, but I did give T.J. an actual friend other than Cyrus so he&rsquo;s not an almost loner, and I&rsquo;m adding some of T.J.&rsquo;s home life. It&rsquo;s mostly just a fluffy&nbsp;holiday fic with T.J. and Cyrus.&nbsp;I am planning around 6-8 chapters, and&nbsp;I am currently waiting to post on AO3.</b></p>\n<p>After basketball practice, T.J. rushes to his locker to pull out his phone. He can&rsquo;t hold back the smile that tugs at his mouth when he sees the text from the contact name &lsquo;Underdog&rsquo;. He opens it up to see &lsquo;Hey, can you meet me, Andi, and Buffy at The Spoon after practice? It&rsquo;s the last school night before Hanukkah begins which is an especially busy time when you have four parents (I&rsquo;m definitely not ready to be psychoanalyzed like I am every year because I have therapist aunts and uncles too). Okay I&rsquo;ll stop rambling, but lmk if you can come.&rsquo; His smile grows at the adorableness of the boy&rsquo;s rants. They had become increasingly common and he was hoping that it was because Cyrus was feeling the same feelings of affection that T.J. was feeling towards Cyrus.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, his teammate&rsquo;s words pull him out of the clouds and back to earth. &ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s Kippen all smiley about?&rdquo; Darren teases. T.J. instinctively puts his phone down and begins to wipe off his sweaty face with the towel in his locker.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably that Goodman kid,&rdquo; his friend Chris yells from the opposite side of the smelly locker room.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oooo, does T.J. have a girl?&rdquo; Darren coos causing T.J.&rsquo;s jaw to tense. Darren isn&rsquo;t exactly the most&nbsp;&ldquo;woke&rdquo;, and he doesn&rsquo;t always make the most sensitive comments. But T.J. doesn&rsquo;t want to hide himself from his teammates anymore.</p>\n</p>",

Bex answers it and greets Cyrus warmly, a second later a happy Andi comes bouncing out and tackles Cyrus with a hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe party sure has put you in a good mood.\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, I love hugs.\u201d Cyrus gives her an extra squeeze. The two part and Bex wears an ebarrassing grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Andi questions and Bex points above their heads. Both Andi and Cyrus look up and find a mistletoe hung above them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d The pair both express their disgust in unison.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad luck not to.\u201d Bex is disappointed.\u00a0\u201cChristmas will be cursed&hellip; Or something?\u201d Bex coaxes her head in confusion.<br/></p><p>\u201cGood thing I don\u2019t celebrate Christmas.\u201d Cyrus laughs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a cursed Christmas!\u201d Andi says quickly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Cyrus sighs and he cups her cheeks in either hand and Andi is surprised as she was only kidding and was certainly not expecting him to kiss her. Cyrus quickly goes in and exaggerates the\u00a0\u2018mwah\u2019 as he smooches her nose.\u00a0\u201cThere, the Christmas spirits are appeased.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit, Cyrus!\u201d Bex is amused and Andi giggles out of surprise as she wipes her nose.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Once inside their home, it appears that Cyrus was the last one to arrive as it wasn\u2019t a<i> party </i>party, more a festive gathering between the group of friends.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus spies TJ across the room chatting pleasantly with Jonah and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel happy that the two were getting along better. A few feet away from the boys is Amber and Libby, Amber looks to be getting a lesson in the ASL alphabet by Libby whilst seperate to the two pairings is Walker and Buffy awkwardly interacting with each other. <i>This is going to be an interesting night, </i>Cyrus thought to himself, but at least he\u2019d have TJ to cling onto whilst everyone else has their romantic drama all crammed in the same <i>very small\u00a0</i>room.</p><p>Apart from the Secret Santa game Andi forced on everyone and the faint carols playing in the background, it wasn\u2019t much of a Christmas themed party at all. The group played a few games in the living space together.\u00a0Many of which involved pairs. The teams were the same each game, Buffy and Walker, Jonah and Libby, Amber and Andi and TJ and Cyrus. The matches tended to shine a spotlight on who worked well together and who didn\u2019t. Whilst the two girls and two boys were on fire, Walker and Buffy as well as Jonah and Libby seemed to be struggling to communicate properly.\u00a0</p><p>Still gathered in the living room, Andi serves up fancy hot cocoa for everyone and she then kicks off the gift exchange. She picks up a present from the pile and hands it to the person on the label. That person then has to try and guess who made their present after opening. The gift exchanged lightened the mood in the room after things got a little tense during the games. Everyone is laughing and having a good time as they all try to work out who the handmade gifts were from. Naturally there were a few comical and farfetched guesses amongst them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis one is for you, Cyrus.\u201d Andi\u2019s brows crinkle as she hands the present over to him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTJ.\u201d Cyrus says with a confident and amused smile before he even has the present in hand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d TJ chuckles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow did you know without even opening it?\u201d Andi questions with a scrunched face.<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you two cheat?\u201d Buffy accuses.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, never.\u201d Cyrus says with a laugh as he holds up the poorly wrapped gift,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d know these lousy wrapping skills anywhere.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cRude.\u201d TJ\u2019s attempt to look offended is foiled by his smile.</p><p>Cyrus opens the gift and is more than happy with its contents.\u00a0\u201cFive free muffin vouchers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know sometimes you have difficulty getting your own so I\u2019m willing to get them for you.\u201d TJ chuckles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe TJ Kippen is going to arrive at school early on five different occasions to wait in line and to get me muffins.\u201d Cyrus says in a purposely goofy way.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo one said anything about getting to school early, or waiting in line.\u201d TJ points a finger.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAmazing. That\u2019s so thoughtful of you.\u201d Cyrus ignores TJ and smiles wider thus causing a few chuckles in the room, mainly from Buffy and Andi as they were the closest to Cyrus\u2019 muffin escapes.\u00a0</p><p>After the Secret Santa is over, everyone breaks off into groups or pairings to have their own conversations. Cyrus takes the opportunity to go into the bag he came with and retrieve an extra present he had brought along. Cyrus hides the gift behind his back and scans the room for TJ. Cyrus\u2019 gaze falls upon the boy just as he notices TJ slip out the front door. Cyrus quickly follows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d Cyrus questions and the front door clicks shut behind him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI just wanted some fresh air.\u201d TJ says with a smile,\u00a0\u201cIt was really warm in there.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Cyrus agrees as he had felt quite flushed with the heat turned on so high and he was even more flustered now standing out on the welcome mat because Cyrus knew directly above them was a mistletoe. Cyrus makes a conscious effort not to look up, not even slightly as he didn\u2019t want to draw attention to it and make things weird.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been pretending like I haven&rsquo;t noticed you hiding something behind your back this whole time. What is it?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The reminder of the gift is enough to distract Cyrus from his mistletoe nerves and he excitedly reveals the small wrapped present,\u00a0\u201cI wasn\u2019t your Secret Santa but I still wanted to get you something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d TJ furrows his brows.\u00a0\u201cI only got you the one gift-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d Cyrus insists as he passes the present.<br/></p><p>TJ gives in and carefully unwraps the gift. Surprise washes over his expression, not utter shock but TJ was completely unsuspecting of its contents. TJ holds up the object,\u00a0\u201cYou made this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI heard popsicle stick frames were all the rage.\u201d Cyrus cutely shrugs his shoulder.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ grips the handmade popsicle stick frame photo in his hand and looks at it like it was the most precious gift he\u2019s ever received.\u00a0\u201cDid you take this photo?\u201d TJ peels his gaze away from the sweet gift to look at Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nods,\u00a0\u201cI thought it was a moment worth capturing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looks back to the photo with a smile. It\u2019s a picture Cyrus snapped whilst TJ, Tess and the twins decorated the tree. It was such a joy filled moment that Cyrus couldn\u2019t help himself, then after learning about TJ\u2019s heartbreak over his family being broken he wanted to do something to remind TJ that wasn\u2019t the case at all.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even mind if you regift it to your mom.\u201d Cyrus says with a goofy smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t really joking when he said that but he was being funny, although TJ\u00a0doesn\u2019t react to him. Instead he continues to look at the frame like it was a precious gem.\u00a0Cyrus noticed that TJ was in awe over the gift and with him being so touched by it, it touched Cyrus in return but then Cyrus notices a second wave of emotion wash over TJ.\u00a0\u201cTJ are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d TJ clears his throat and he uses the back of his free hand to wipe the corner of his eye.\u00a0\u201cWhat a loser, I\u2019m getting emotional over a popsicle stick frame. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise for being emotional,\u201d Cyrus frowns,\u00a0\u201cEspecially not to me.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ sniffles again but a soft smile crosses his face,\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile creeps wider at that response and the two share a soft smiley moment. Cyrus couldn\u2019t help it, his gaze wandered up and he brought attention to the item hanging above their head. Cyrus tries to laugh it off casually but TJ\u2019s stare lingers on the mistletoe for a while before he\u00a0looks at Cyrus with a hard to read expression. Cyrus goes to say something but the words didn\u2019t come out, instead he silently found himself wishing that TJ would kiss him. Then, Cyrus wasn\u2019t sure if he was imagining it or not but he thought TJ might have been thinking about the same thing. Then without warning, TJ closes the space between them, his lips crashing against Cyrus\u2019.</p><p>At first Cyrus is completely shocked, a stiff by stander, his eyes are opened and confused but then he naturally adapts. His eyes close, his lips loosen and he falls into the kiss but just as Cyrus let himself enjoy it, TJ pulls away quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u00a0shouldn&rsquo;t have done\u00a0that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d TJ is panicked.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus is at a loss for words, part of him was still unsure if he had\u00a0imagined it all or not.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d TJ says with a worried expression.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Cyrus forces the word out but TJ was already fleeing before Cyrus could actually stop him. Cyrus is left speechless standing under the mistletoe with his finger pressed to his lips.<i> What just happened?</i><br/></p><hr><p><b>End Notes: </b>I hate writing kissing scenes!

Bex answers it and greets Cyrus warmly, a second later a happy Andi comes bouncing out and tackles Cyrus with a hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe party sure has put you in a good mood.\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, I love hugs.\u201d Cyrus gives her an extra squeeze. The two part and Bex wears an ebarrassing grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Andi questions and Bex points above their heads. Both Andi and Cyrus look up and find a mistletoe hung above them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d The pair both express their disgust in unison.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad luck not to.\u201d Bex is disappointed.\u00a0\u201cChristmas will be cursed\u2026 Or something?\u201d Bex coaxes her head in confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cGood thing I don\u2019t celebrate Christmas.\u201d Cyrus laughs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a cursed Christmas!\u201d Andi says quickly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Cyrus sighs and he cups her cheeks in either hand and Andi is surprised as she was only kidding and was certainly not expecting him to kiss her. Cyrus quickly goes in and exaggerates the\u00a0\u2018mwah\u2019 as he smooches her nose.\u00a0\u201cThere, the Christmas spirits are appeased.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit, Cyrus!\u201d Bex is amused and Andi giggles out of surprise as she wipes her nose.\u00a0<br></p><p>Once inside their home, it appears that Cyrus was the last one to arrive as it wasn\u2019t a<i> party </i>party, more a festive gathering between the group of friends.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus spies TJ across the room chatting pleasantly with Jonah and he couldn\u2019t help but feel happy that the two were getting along better. A few feet away from the boys is Amber and Libby, Amber looks to be getting a lesson in the ASL alphabet by Libby whilst seperate to the two pairings is Walker and Buffy awkwardly interacting with each other. <i>This is going to be an interesting night, </i>Cyrus thought to himself, but at least he\u2019d have TJ to cling onto whilst everyone else has their romantic drama all crammed in the same <i>very small\u00a0</i>room.</p><p>Apart from the Secret Santa game Andi forced on everyone and the faint carols playing in the background, it wasn\u2019t much of a Christmas themed party at all. The group played a few games in the living space together.\u00a0Many of which involved pairs. The teams were the same each game, Buffy and Walker, Jonah and Libby, Amber and Andi and TJ and Cyrus. The matches tended to shine a spotlight on who worked well together and who didn\u2019t. Whilst the two girls and two boys were on fire, Walker and Buffy as well as Jonah and Libby seemed to be struggling to communicate properly.\u00a0</p><p>Still gathered in the living room, Andi serves up fancy hot cocoa for everyone and she then kicks off the gift exchange. She picks up a present from the pile and hands it to the person on the label. That person then has to try and guess who made their present after opening. The gift exchanged lightened the mood in the room after things got a little tense during the games. Everyone is laughing and having a good time as they all try to work out who the handmade gifts were from. Naturally there were a few comical and farfetched guesses amongst them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis one is for you, Cyrus.\u201d Andi\u2019s brows crinkle as she hands the present over to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTJ.\u201d Cyrus says with a confident and amused smile before he even has the present in hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d TJ chuckles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow did you know without even opening it?\u201d Andi questions with a scrunched face.<br></p><p>\u201cDid you two cheat?\u201d Buffy accuses.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, never.\u201d Cyrus says with a laugh as he holds up the poorly wrapped gift,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d know these lousy wrapping skills anywhere.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRude.\u201d TJ\u2019s attempt to look offended is foiled by his smile.</p><p>Cyrus opens the gift and is more than happy with its contents.\u00a0\u201cFive free muffin vouchers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know sometimes you have difficulty getting your own so I\u2019m willing to get them for you.\u201d TJ chuckles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe TJ Kippen is going to arrive at school early on five different occasions to wait in line and to get me muffins.\u201d Cyrus says in a purposely goofy way.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo one said anything about getting to school early, or waiting in line.\u201d TJ points a finger.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAmazing. That\u2019s so thoughtful of you.\u201d Cyrus ignores TJ and smiles wider thus causing a few chuckles in the room, mainly from Buffy and Andi as they were the closest to Cyrus\u2019 muffin escapes.\u00a0</p><p>After the Secret Santa is over, everyone breaks off into groups or pairings to have their own conversations. Cyrus takes the opportunity to go into the bag he came with and retrieve an extra present he had brought along. Cyrus hides the gift behind his back and scans the room for TJ. Cyrus\u2019 gaze falls upon the boy just as he notices TJ slip out the front door. Cyrus quickly follows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d Cyrus questions and the front door clicks shut behind him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI just wanted some fresh air.\u201d TJ says with a smile,\u00a0\u201cIt was really warm in there.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Cyrus agrees as he had felt quite flushed with the heat turned on so high and he was even more flustered now standing out on the welcome mat because Cyrus knew directly above them was a mistletoe. Cyrus makes a conscious effort not to look up, not even slightly as he didn\u2019t want to draw attention to it and make things weird.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been pretending like I haven\u2019t noticed you hiding something behind your back this whole time. What is it?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>The reminder of the gift is enough to distract Cyrus from his mistletoe nerves and he excitedly reveals the small wrapped present,\u00a0\u201cI wasn\u2019t your Secret Santa but I still wanted to get you something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d TJ furrows his brows.\u00a0\u201cI only got you the one gift-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d Cyrus insists as he passes the present.<br></p><p>TJ gives in and carefully unwraps the gift. Surprise washes over his expression, not utter shock but TJ was completely unsuspecting of its contents. TJ holds up the object,\u00a0\u201cYou made this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI heard popsicle stick frames were all the rage.\u201d Cyrus cutely shrugs his shoulder.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ grips the handmade popsicle stick frame photo in his hand and looks at it like it was the most precious gift he\u2019s ever received.\u00a0\u201cDid you take this photo?\u201d TJ peels his gaze away from the sweet gift to look at Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nods,\u00a0\u201cI thought it was a moment worth capturing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looks back to the photo with a smile. It\u2019s a picture Cyrus snapped whilst TJ, Tess and the twins decorated the tree. It was such a joy filled moment that Cyrus couldn\u2019t help himself, then after learning about TJ\u2019s heartbreak over his family being broken he wanted to do something to remind TJ that wasn\u2019t the case at all.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even mind if you regift it to your mom.\u201d Cyrus says with a goofy smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t really joking when he said that but he was being funny, although TJ\u00a0doesn\u2019t react to him. Instead he continues to look at the frame like it was a precious gem.\u00a0Cyrus noticed that TJ was in awe over the gift and with him being so touched by it, it touched Cyrus in return but then Cyrus notices a second wave of emotion wash over TJ.\u00a0\u201cTJ are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d TJ clears his throat and he uses the back of his free hand to wipe the corner of his eye.\u00a0\u201cWhat a loser, I\u2019m getting emotional over a popsicle stick frame. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise for being emotional,\u201d Cyrus frowns,\u00a0\u201cEspecially not to me.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ sniffles again but a soft smile crosses his face,\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile creeps wider at that response and the two share a soft smiley moment. Cyrus couldn\u2019t help it, his gaze wandered up and he brought attention to the item hanging above their head. Cyrus tries to laugh it off casually but TJ\u2019s stare lingers on the mistletoe for a while before he\u00a0looks at Cyrus with a hard to read expression. Cyrus goes to say something but the words didn\u2019t come out, instead he silently found himself wishing that TJ would kiss him. Then, Cyrus wasn\u2019t sure if he was imagining it or not but he thought TJ might have been thinking about the same thing. Then without warning, TJ closes the space between them, his lips crashing against Cyrus\u2019.</p><p>At first Cyrus is completely shocked, a stiff by stander, his eyes are opened and confused but then he naturally adapts. His eyes close, his lips loosen and he falls into the kiss but just as Cyrus let himself enjoy it, TJ pulls away quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u00a0shouldn\u2019t have done\u00a0that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d TJ is panicked.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus is at a loss for words, part of him was still unsure if he had\u00a0imagined it all or not.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d TJ says with a worried expression.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Cyrus forces the word out but TJ was already fleeing before Cyrus could actually stop him. Cyrus is left speechless standing under the mistletoe with his finger pressed to his lips.<i> What just happened?</i><br></p><hr><p><b>End Notes: </b>I hate writing kissing scenes! They didda da smoochy the end. lol..\u00a0</p><p>So. That happened\u2026.

Cyrus quickly goes in and exaggerates the\u00a0\u2018mwah\u2019 as he smooches her nose.\u00a0\u201cThere, the Christmas spirits are appeased.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit, Cyrus!\u201d Bex is amused and Andi giggles out of surprise as she wipes her nose.\u00a0<br></p><p>Once inside their home, it appears that Cyrus was the last one to arrive as it wasn\u2019t a<i> party </i>party, more a festive gathering between the group of friends.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus spies TJ across the room chatting pleasantly with Jonah and he couldn\u2019t help but feel happy that the two were getting along better. A few feet away from the boys is Amber and Libby, Amber looks to be getting a lesson in the ASL alphabet by Libby whilst seperate to the two pairings is Walker and Buffy awkwardly interacting with each other. <i>This is going to be an interesting night, </i>Cyrus thought to himself, but at least he\u2019d have TJ to cling onto whilst everyone else has their romantic drama all crammed in the same <i>very small\u00a0</i>room.</p><p>Apart from the Secret Santa game Andi forced on everyone and the faint carols playing in the background, it wasn\u2019t much of a Christmas themed party at all. The group played a few games in the living space together.\u00a0Many of which involved pairs. The teams were the same each game, Buffy and Walker, Jonah and Libby, Amber and Andi and TJ and Cyrus. The matches tended to shine a spotlight on who worked well together and who didn\u2019t. Whilst the two girls and two boys were on fire, Walker and Buffy as well as Jonah and Libby seemed to be struggling to communicate properly.\u00a0</p><p>Still gathered in the living room, Andi serves up fancy hot cocoa for everyone and she then kicks off the gift exchange. She picks up a present from the pile and hands it to the person on the label. That person then has to try and guess who made their present after opening. The gift exchanged lightened the mood in the room after things got a little tense during the games. Everyone is laughing and having a good time as they all try to work out who the handmade gifts were from. Naturally there were a few comical and farfetched guesses amongst them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis one is for you, Cyrus.\u201d Andi\u2019s brows crinkle as she hands the present over to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTJ.\u201d Cyrus says with a confident and amused smile before he even has the present in hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d TJ chuckles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow did you know without even opening it?\u201d Andi questions with a scrunched face.<br></p><p>\u201cDid you two cheat?\u201d Buffy accuses.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, never.\u201d Cyrus says with a laugh as he holds up the poorly wrapped gift,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d know these lousy wrapping skills anywhere.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRude.\u201d TJ\u2019s attempt to look offended is foiled by his smile.</p><p>Cyrus opens the gift and is more than happy with its contents.\u00a0\u201cFive free muffin vouchers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know sometimes you have difficulty getting your own so I\u2019m willing to get them for you.\u201d TJ chuckles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe TJ Kippen is going to arrive at school early on five different occasions to wait in line and to get me muffins.\u201d Cyrus says in a purposely goofy way.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo one said anything about getting to school early, or waiting in line.\u201d TJ points a finger.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAmazing. That\u2019s so thoughtful of you.\u201d Cyrus ignores TJ and smiles wider thus causing a few chuckles in the room, mainly from Buffy and Andi as they were the closest to Cyrus\u2019 muffin escapes.\u00a0</p><p>After the Secret Santa is over, everyone breaks off into groups or pairings to have their own conversations. Cyrus takes the opportunity to go into the bag he came with and retrieve an extra present he had brought along. Cyrus hides the gift behind his back and scans the room for TJ. Cyrus\u2019 gaze falls upon the boy just as he notices TJ slip out the front door. Cyrus quickly follows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d Cyrus questions and the front door clicks shut behind him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI just wanted some fresh air.\u201d TJ says with a smile,\u00a0\u201cIt was really warm in there.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Cyrus agrees as he had felt quite flushed with the heat turned on so high and he was even more flustered now standing out on the welcome mat because Cyrus knew directly above them was a mistletoe. Cyrus makes a conscious effort not to look up, not even slightly as he didn\u2019t want to draw attention to it and make things weird.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been pretending like I haven\u2019t noticed you hiding something behind your back this whole time. What is it?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>The reminder of the gift is enough to distract Cyrus from his mistletoe nerves and he excitedly reveals the small wrapped present,\u00a0\u201cI wasn\u2019t your Secret Santa but I still wanted to get you something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d TJ furrows his brows.\u00a0\u201cI only got you the one gift-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d Cyrus insists as he passes the present.<br></p><p>TJ gives in and carefully unwraps the gift. Surprise washes over his expression, not utter shock but TJ was completely unsuspecting of its contents. TJ holds up the object,\u00a0\u201cYou made this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI heard popsicle stick frames were all the rage.\u201d Cyrus cutely shrugs his shoulder.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ grips the handmade popsicle stick frame photo in his hand and looks at it like it was the most precious gift he\u2019s ever received.\u00a0\u201cDid you take this photo?\u201d TJ peels his gaze away from the sweet gift to look at Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nods,\u00a0\u201cI thought it was a moment worth capturing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looks back to the photo with a smile. It\u2019s a picture Cyrus snapped whilst TJ, Tess and the twins decorated the tree. It was such a joy filled moment that Cyrus couldn\u2019t help himself, then after learning about TJ\u2019s heartbreak over his family being broken he wanted to do something to remind TJ that wasn\u2019t the case at all.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even mind if you regift it to your mom.\u201d Cyrus says with a goofy smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t really joking when he said that but he was being funny, although TJ\u00a0doesn\u2019t react to him. Instead he continues to look at the frame like it was a precious gem.\u00a0Cyrus noticed that TJ was in awe over the gift and with him being so touched by it, it touched Cyrus in return but then Cyrus notices a second wave of emotion wash over TJ.\u00a0\u201cTJ are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d TJ clears his throat and he uses the back of his free hand to wipe the corner of his eye.\u00a0\u201cWhat a loser, I\u2019m getting emotional over a popsicle stick frame. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise for being emotional,\u201d Cyrus frowns,\u00a0\u201cEspecially not to me.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ sniffles again but a soft smile crosses his face,\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile creeps wider at that response and the two share a soft smiley moment. Cyrus couldn\u2019t help it, his gaze wandered up and he brought attention to the item hanging above their head. Cyrus tries to laugh it off casually but TJ\u2019s stare lingers on the mistletoe for a while before he\u00a0looks at Cyrus with a hard to read expression. Cyrus goes to say something but the words didn\u2019t come out, instead he silently found himself wishing that TJ would kiss him. Then, Cyrus wasn\u2019t sure if he was imagining it or not but he thought TJ might have been thinking about the same thing. Then without warning, TJ closes the space between them, his lips crashing against Cyrus\u2019.</p><p>At first Cyrus is completely shocked, a stiff by stander, his eyes are opened and confused but then he naturally adapts. His eyes close, his lips loosen and he falls into the kiss but just as Cyrus let himself enjoy it, TJ pulls away quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u00a0shouldn\u2019t have done\u00a0that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d TJ is panicked.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus is at a loss for words, part of him was still unsure if he had\u00a0imagined it all or not.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d TJ says with a worried expression.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Cyrus forces the word out but TJ was already fleeing before Cyrus could actually stop him. Cyrus is left speechless standing under the mistletoe with his finger pressed to his lips.<i> What just happened?</i><br></p><hr><p><b>End Notes: </b>I hate writing kissing scenes!

Both Andi and Cyrus look up and find a mistletoe hung above them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ew.&rdquo; The pair both express their disgust in unison.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad luck not to.&rdquo; Bex is disappointed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Christmas will be cursed&hellip; Or something?&rdquo; Bex coaxes her head in confusion.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good thing I don&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas.&rdquo; Cyrus laughs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a cursed Christmas!&rdquo; Andi says quickly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Cyrus sighs and he cups her cheeks in either hand and Andi is surprised as she was only kidding and was certainly not expecting him to kiss her. Cyrus quickly goes in and exaggerates the&nbsp;&lsquo;mwah&rsquo; as he smooches her nose.&nbsp;&ldquo;There, the Christmas spirits are appeased.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit, Cyrus!&rdquo; Bex is amused and Andi giggles out of surprise as she wipes her nose.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Once inside their home, it appears that Cyrus was the last one to arrive as it wasn&rsquo;t a<i> party </i>party, more a festive gathering between the group of friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus spies TJ across the room chatting pleasantly with Jonah and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel happy that the two were getting along better. A few feet away from the boys is Amber and Libby, Amber looks to be getting a lesson in the ASL alphabet by Libby whilst seperate to the two pairings is Walker and Buffy awkwardly interacting with each other. <i>This is going to be an interesting night, </i>Cyrus thought to himself, but at least he&rsquo;d have TJ to cling onto whilst everyone else has their romantic drama all crammed in the same <i>very small&nbsp;</i>room.</p><p>Apart from the Secret Santa game Andi forced on everyone and the faint carols playing in the background, it wasn&rsquo;t much of a Christmas themed party at all. The group played a few games in the living space together.&nbsp;Many of which involved pairs. The teams were the same each game, Buffy and Walker, Jonah and Libby, Amber and Andi and TJ and Cyrus. The matches tended to shine a spotlight on who worked well together and who didn&rsquo;t. Whilst the two girls and two boys were on fire, Walker and Buffy as well as Jonah and Libby seemed to be struggling to communicate properly.&nbsp;</p><p>Still gathered in the living room, Andi serves up fancy hot cocoa for everyone and she then kicks off the gift exchange. She picks up a present from the pile and hands it to the person on the label. That person then has to try and guess who made their present after opening. The gift exchanged lightened the mood in the room after things got a little tense during the games. Everyone is laughing and having a good time as they all try to work out who the handmade gifts were from. Naturally there were a few comical and farfetched guesses amongst them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This one is for you, Cyrus.&rdquo; Andi&rsquo;s brows crinkle as she hands the present over to him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;TJ.&rdquo; Cyrus says with a confident and amused smile before he even has the present in hand.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Am I that obvious?&rdquo; TJ chuckles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How did you know without even opening it?&rdquo; Andi questions with a scrunched face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you two cheat?&rdquo; Buffy accuses.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, never.&rdquo; Cyrus says with a laugh as he holds up the poorly wrapped gift,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know these lousy wrapping skills anywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Rude.&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s attempt to look offended is foiled by his smile.</p><p>Cyrus opens the gift and is more than happy with its contents.&nbsp;&ldquo;Five free muffin vouchers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know sometimes you have difficulty getting your own so I&rsquo;m willing to get them for you.&rdquo; TJ chuckles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow, I can&rsquo;t believe TJ Kippen is going to arrive at school early on five different occasions to wait in line and to get me muffins.&rdquo; Cyrus says in a purposely goofy way.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No one said anything about getting to school early, or waiting in line.&rdquo; TJ points a finger.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Amazing. That&rsquo;s so thoughtful of you.&rdquo; Cyrus ignores TJ and smiles wider thus causing a few chuckles in the room, mainly from Buffy and Andi as they were the closest to Cyrus&rsquo; muffin escapes.&nbsp;</p><p>After the Secret Santa is over, everyone breaks off into groups or pairings to have their own conversations. Cyrus takes the opportunity to go into the bag he came with and retrieve an extra present he had brought along. Cyrus hides the gift behind his back and scans the room for TJ. Cyrus&rsquo; gaze falls upon the boy just as he notices TJ slip out the front door. Cyrus quickly follows.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Going somewhere?&rdquo; Cyrus questions and the front door clicks shut behind him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I just wanted some fresh air.&rdquo; TJ says with a smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;It was really warm in there.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo; Cyrus agrees as he had felt quite flushed with the heat turned on so high and he was even more flustered now standing out on the welcome mat because Cyrus knew directly above them was a mistletoe. Cyrus makes a conscious effort not to look up, not even slightly as he didn&rsquo;t want to draw attention to it and make things weird.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been pretending like I haven&rsquo;t noticed you hiding something behind your back this whole time. What is it?&rdquo; TJ questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The reminder of the gift is enough to distract Cyrus from his mistletoe nerves and he excitedly reveals the small wrapped present,&nbsp;&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t your Secret Santa but I still wanted to get you something.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You really didn&rsquo;t have to do that.&rdquo; TJ furrows his brows.&nbsp;&ldquo;I only got you the one gift-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just open it.&rdquo; Cyrus insists as he passes the present.<br /></p><p>TJ gives in and carefully unwraps the gift. Surprise washes over his expression, not utter shock but TJ was completely unsuspecting of its contents. TJ holds up the object,&nbsp;&ldquo;You made this?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard popsicle stick frames were all the rage.&rdquo; Cyrus cutely shrugs his shoulder.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ grips the handmade popsicle stick frame photo in his hand and looks at it like it was the most precious gift he&rsquo;s ever received.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you take this photo?&rdquo; TJ peels his gaze away from the sweet gift to look at Cyrus.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus nods,&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought it was a moment worth capturing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ looks back to the photo with a smile. It&rsquo;s a picture Cyrus snapped whilst TJ, Tess and the twins decorated the tree. It was such a joy filled moment that Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t help himself, then after learning about TJ&rsquo;s heartbreak over his family being broken he wanted to do something to remind TJ that wasn&rsquo;t the case at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even mind if you regift it to your mom.&rdquo; Cyrus says with a goofy smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t really joking when he said that but he was being funny, although TJ&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t react to him. Instead he continues to look at the frame like it was a precious gem.&nbsp;Cyrus noticed that TJ was in awe over the gift and with him being so touched by it, it touched Cyrus in return but then Cyrus notices a second wave of emotion wash over TJ.&nbsp;&ldquo;TJ are you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; TJ clears his throat and he uses the back of his free hand to wipe the corner of his eye.&nbsp;&ldquo;What a loser, I&rsquo;m getting emotional over a popsicle stick frame. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologise for being emotional,&rdquo; Cyrus frowns,&nbsp;&ldquo;Especially not to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ sniffles again but a soft smile crosses his face,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; smile creeps wider at that response and the two share a soft smiley moment. Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t help it, his gaze wandered up and he brought attention to the item hanging above their head. Cyrus tries to laugh it off casually but TJ&rsquo;s stare lingers on the mistletoe for a while before he&nbsp;looks at Cyrus with a hard to read expression. Cyrus goes to say something but the words didn&rsquo;t come out, instead he silently found himself wishing that TJ would kiss him. Then, Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was imagining it or not but he thought TJ might have been thinking about the same thing. Then without warning, TJ closes the space between them, his lips crashing against Cyrus&rsquo;.</p><p>At first Cyrus is completely shocked, a stiff by stander, his eyes are opened and confused but then he naturally adapts. His eyes close, his lips loosen and he falls into the kiss but just as Cyrus let himself enjoy it, TJ pulls away quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;shouldn&rsquo;t have done&nbsp;that. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; TJ is panicked.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus is at a loss for words, part of him was still unsure if he had&nbsp;imagined it all or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to go.&rdquo; TJ says with a worried expression.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Cyrus forces the word out but TJ was already fleeing before Cyrus could actually stop him. Cyrus is left speechless standing under the mistletoe with his finger pressed to his lips.<i> What just happened?</i><br /></p><hr /><p><b>End Notes: </b>I hate writing kissing scenes!

After a moment\u2019s silence, he crosses his arms and huffs loudly.</p><p>\u201cStop being adorable,\u201d TJ says, biting back a grin. \u201cI\u2019m trying to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not adorable!\u201d Cyrus protests. \u201cI\u2019m angry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people get sick easier than others\u2026 It\u2019s not an insult, Cy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do!\u201d</p><p>TJ takes the soup off the heat and turns to Cyrus, his lips twitching with an amused smile at the sight of his blanket-clad boyfriend. He walks slowly across the room and puts his hands on Cyrus\u2019 shoulders, giving them a gentle squeeze before pulling the blanket away from his face. When Cyrus looks up at him, TJ smothers his frown with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI think the fever\u2019s getting to your head,\u201d he murmurs softly. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest person I\u2019ve ever met, Underdog.

He patiently waits for his boyfriend to swallow his first spoonful, then starts to eat. The soup is the perfect consistency \u2013 not too thick, but not too watery either \u2013 and there\u2019s just the right amount of seasoning. Even Cyrus seems to be enjoying it, despite the occasional gurgling of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d TJ asks him.</p><p>Cyrus licks his lips and nods. \u201cIt\u2019s great, Teej.

But only if you lick the bowl clean\u2026\u201d</p><p>To TJ\u2019s surprise, Cyrus does as he\u2019s told.

I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes, alright?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus concedes with a sigh. \u201cFine. But I expect cuddles when you\u2019re finished!\u201d</p><p>TJ grins. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>He cleans the Goodmans\u2019 kitchen as thoroughly as he can, washing the dishes and wiping down the table until every surface is sparkling. When he\u2019s satisfied, he grabs\u00a0two bottles of water from the fridge and tiptoes into the living room, not wanting to disturb his\u00a0sleeping boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cStop sneaking up on me,\u201d Cyrus grumbles, shooting TJ a\u00a0playful glare over the back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wanna wake you up\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised me cuddles,\u201d Cyrus reminds him. He sits up, the blankets sliding off his shoulders, and reaches out his hands, flexing his fingers in a grabbing motion. \u201cI\u2019m getting impatient!\u201d</p><p>TJ huffs a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re bossy when you\u2019re sick, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Teej</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a dinosaur documentary playing quietly on the TV as TJ settles next to Cyrus, hooking his arm around the younger boy\u2019s waist and tugging him against his side. Cyrus presses his cheek against TJ\u2019s shoulder with a contented sigh, and TJ feels a familiar pang of affection in his chest. He keeps sneaking glances at his boyfriend as Cyrus continues to watch the documentary, smiling fondly at the rambling commentary spilling from his lips. Even when he\u2019s sick, Cyrus\u2019 dinosaur knowledge is adorably impressive.</p><p>A few hours later, when\u00a0the documentary is over and Cyrus is finally asleep, TJ kisses his cheek and\u00a0tells him his biggest and worst-kept secret of all\u2026</p><p>\u201cI love you, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p><b>Three Days Later</b></p><p>Cyrus can\u2019t resist smirking as he places a damp flannel on TJ\u2019s forehead, stifling a laugh at the glare he gets in return. They\u2019re in TJ\u2019s bedroom, watching re-runs of famous basketball games, and TJ is snuggled under the covers of his bed, his skin a sickly shade of white.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your rock-solid immune system?\u201d Cyrus asks with a teasing smile.</p><p>TJ rolls his eyes. \u201cShut up and cuddle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the magic word?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Cy</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d TJ grumbles. \u201cShut up and cuddle me,\u00a0<i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chuckles. \u201cI guess that will do.\u201d</p><p>He lifts the covers and lies next to his boyfriend, his heart fluttering as TJ\u2019s head flops onto his shoulder. They stay like that for hours, until TJ is snoring contentedly beside him and Cyrus can no longer feel his shoulder beneath the dead weight of TJ\u2019s sleep-laden head. But even if TJ weren\u2019t pinning him down right now, he wouldn\u2019t leave his side for anything.</p><p>After all, boyfriends take care of each other when they\u2019re sick.</p>",

He walks slowly across the room and puts his hands on Cyrus\u2019 shoulders, giving them a gentle squeeze before pulling the blanket away from his face. When Cyrus looks up at him, TJ smothers his frown with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI think the fever\u2019s getting to your head,\u201d he murmurs softly. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest person I\u2019ve ever met, Underdog.

He patiently waits for his boyfriend to swallow his first spoonful, then starts to eat. The soup is the perfect consistency \u2013 not too thick, but not too watery either \u2013 and there\u2019s just the right amount of seasoning. Even Cyrus seems to be enjoying it, despite the occasional gurgling of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d TJ asks him.</p><p>Cyrus licks his lips and nods. \u201cIt\u2019s great, Teej.
