I&rsquo;m trying to drive.&rdquo; You notified her and you saw the way your sister rolled your eyes at you before leaning back against the car seat. Usually you didn&rsquo;t have a problem taking her along on long drives, but tonight she was being extremely annoying. She kept on bouncing around in her seat and kept asking you how long it would take before you&rsquo;d arrive while the GPS indicated the exact hour. &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t be so grumpy! As if you weren&rsquo;t nervous the first time you met them.&rdquo; She reminded you, causing a small smile to spread along your lips. She was right, but you would never openly admit that. You and Taehyung had met through a meet and greet after a concert and the be honest, you had barely even known the name BTS back then. You&rsquo;d simply been your friends diver because her mother had refused to give her a ride. Officially she had been grounded that night but since she&rsquo;s already bought the tickets her mom had agreed to let her go, on strict terms.\u00a0</p><p>You had simply been the one being dragged towards a concert of some kind of boy band you had never heard from while all you had wanted to do was sit by the window and drool over your handsome neighbor as he got changed in his bedroom and forgot to lower the blinds. You had never asked her to be a part of that whole scene. And when she had told you that she&rsquo;s won a meet an greet in some kind of radio contest, you had been miserably. Because you had been sure you were going to make a fool out of yourself and they would find out that you didn&rsquo;t even know them. They had found out, but they had rather seemed surprised than offended. And that was how you had met Taehyung. From the first moment you&rsquo;d walked into the room your eye had fallen on him, thanks to his handsome looks. But it seemed like the attraction had been mutual because he&rsquo;d asked you for your number before you left. And then one thing had let to another. Ever since you hadn&rsquo;t drooled over your neighbor once.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should get us into a car accident! Now sit still, we&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo; You warned her as you stilled the car in front of a red traffic light. You&rsquo;d promised your younger sister that you would take her to meet them one time, it seemed like that time had come. Yet, to you it couldn&rsquo;t have been a more inconvenient moment than this one. You were in the middle of exams and you had one one more day left before you&rsquo;d need to be done reviewing your notes. Time wasn&rsquo;t on your side right now, you surely didn&rsquo;t have plenty of it. But taehyung had sent you the tickets, leaving the decision to you if you would be able to come or not. But your sister had been clear, she thought she had waited long enough and it was time for her to see the guys. She used the excuse of her having to judge your boyfriend, checking if he was right for you. But you knew she was a fan and that she had a soft spot for Jimin, so that was just a facade. You really hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t faint. It wasn&rsquo;t like you weren&rsquo;t excited to see Taehyung, he&rsquo;d been away on tour for a while now and you&rsquo;d missed him. But right now just wasn&rsquo;t the right moment.\u00a0</p><p>In the back of your mind you couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about all the things you still had to do, about the chapters you still had to read in your text book and the concepts you still had to memorize. You should be behind your desk right now, in some baggy clothing, pulling your hair out of your scalp. But instead you were hearing, enjoying some free time you didn&rsquo;t have. Just thinking about it almost caused you to get a mental break down. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to see BTS! How can I not be excited! This is big. All my friends will be so jealous.&rdquo; Your sister stated and you rolled your eyes at that. After being in a relationship with one of them for over a year it didn&rsquo;t really sound like anything special anymore. It sometimes caused you to forget that for others, it was a huge deal. To you they&rsquo;d simply become people, who walked around in their pajamas at the dorm and ate pizza for breakfast. But to your sister, they were gods. &ldquo;Just promise me you won&rsquo;t scream. If you&rsquo;ll scream I&rsquo;ll drag you straight out of there and we&rsquo;ll be heading straight home.&rdquo; You warned, and you watched the way she mocked you as you sent the car towards a parking lot at the back of the venue.\u00a0</p><p>Taehyung had told you to park here. It was usually reserved for cast members and staff, but he&rsquo;d made sure that after showing your passport the security guard would allow you to put your car there. You spotted the man a few feet away, but he immediately moved over once he noticed you. He had a scowl resting on his forehead, probably to shoo everyone away who wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be here. Quickly you got out your passport, and he read your name a few times before something seemed to hit him. &ldquo;Pick a spot.&rdquo; He muttered, handing back your card before turning around and walking back towards the same spot he came from. &ldquo;Jeez, he&rsquo;s in a great mood. Perhaps the two of you should spend some time together, maybe you can cheer each other up.&rdquo; Your sister joked, causing you to glare at her as you parked the car in an abandoned spot. She literally flew out of the door once you&rsquo;d turned down the engine. You wondered how much adrenaline was present in her blood right now, but you were sure it was a lot. Heaving a deep sigh you loosened your seat belt and grabbed your bag from the back seat before following her example and getting out.\u00a0</p><p>It was cold and it was raining softly, definitely not the kind of weather which made you feel any better. Still, you felt a certain amount of butterflies flutter through your stomach when the two of you gathered to walk towards the venue after you&rsquo;d locked the car. &ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; She asked as you opened the back door, where the two of you immediately ran into another set of security guards. This time around it didn&rsquo;t seem necessary for you to show them your passport, they let you pass without a word. &ldquo;You look fine, and it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ll really care about how you look. Just stay calm, don&rsquo;t drool and don&rsquo;t snap any pictures without asking them. No snapchat to show off with your friends. I want Taehyung to like you, I don&rsquo;t want him to think you&rsquo;re some psycho fan.&rdquo; You muttered as you walked through the warm hallways, searching for the dressing rooms. Taehyung had told you to step by an hour before the concert so the two of you could spend some time before the show. He&rsquo;d be too tired to do much afterwards and he didn&rsquo;t want to spend time with you in a boring hotel room. Even though you had asked him if your sister could come and he had said he didn&rsquo;t mind at all and he was excited to meet her, you were still a little worried. She could be very straight forward from time to time.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you won&rsquo;t even notice I'l here. You just keep your attention to your boyfriend, I&rsquo;ll just whelm silently about how hot he is.&rdquo; She chuckled, and this time she managed to make a little smile appear on your face. She was an idiot and a handful, but she was great. You noticed her wiping her sweaty hands across her jeans as you stilled in front of a wooden door, which was firmly closed. You could only hope none of them were getting changed. Lifting your hand you knocked the door, waited for a loud reply of several voices colliding together and then opened it. &ldquo;_____________!&rdquo; Jimin spoke cheerfully as soon as you stepped inside. Smiling brightly you waved at him, watching him as he got up from his seat to hug you. You waved at them, realizing they were heaving a relaxing meal before the concert would start. Surprisingly you found your sister hiding behind you as he wrapped his arms around you and gave you a squeeze. Several greetings flew your way, until the boy in front of you was the first and who noticed you weren&rsquo;t alone.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you brought someone? Hi there!&rdquo; Jimin cheered, extending his hand to shake the one of the girl standing behind you. You bit back a grin when you saw the way her head turned bright red out of shyness. There was nothing left of her blunt behavior now. &ldquo;Babe.&rdquo; The word was low and soft inside of your head when all of a sudden two arms wrapped around you from behind. A wonderful warmth spread itself through your body because of the feeling. You knew it could only be one person. Leaning back against his warm chest you could feel the way he pressed a peck on top of your crown before he tried his best to turn you around so he could look at you. Teasing him you protested for a while, before giving into him anyway and spinning on your feet. As soon as his bright smile came into view it seemed as if the biggest part of your worries were fading and you couldn&rsquo;t stop yourself from diving in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo; You stated, wrapping your arms around his neck and feeling the way his circles around your middle. It had been such a long time since you&rsquo;d seen him in person. You hated it whenever he was leaving for tour, because you knew it would and a great while before you would see him again. &ldquo;I missed you too. I&rsquo;m so glad you were able to come.&rdquo; He muttered, pressing his nose against the side of your face in a sweat gesture. His words instantly reminded you of all the reasons why you shouldn&rsquo;t be here, causing some of the excitement you felt to disappear. All those unfinished chapters, all those pages. Would you even be able to sleep before the exam or would you be busy all night trying to fix what was broken. The thought of failing made you want to cringe, it simply wasn&rsquo;t an option. &ldquo;Hey, are you okay? You&rsquo;re so tense.&rdquo; Taehyung whispered softly and you could sense his hands digging into your back, touching all the muscles which had become sore by leaning over your books all day. Holding back a groan you pushed yourself away from him, steading yourself as you smiled at him.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine! I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s my muscles we should worry about.&rdquo; After all you weren&rsquo;t the one who was preparing yourself to perform for the umpteenth time in a row. He was always busy and he was stressed so often, and besides all of that, he never complained. Your exams would be over in a week, you just had to hold on and then it would be over soon enough. Yet, it seemed like the thought had already taken master of his mind, making it impossible for him to let it go. &ldquo;Have you been taking care of yourself? You lost weight.&rdquo; He said, causing you to blink your eyes at him in surprise. He wasn&rsquo;t the one to notice those kinds of details all too quickly. It was something you hadn&rsquo;t even really noticed.\u00a0 Alright, it was easier for you to get into your jeans in the mornings, and maybe you hadn&rsquo;t been eating as frequently as you should, but apart from that you felt fine. You simply didn&rsquo;t have the time to spend a lot of time chit chatting with your mom over diner, so you usually ate while going through your notes. It had never seemed to be a problem to anyone.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;No I didn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re imagining things. I&rsquo;m totally fine.&rdquo; You assured him, only to be interrupted by your sister, who suddenly showed up behind you. To be honest you&rsquo;d completely forgotten about her presence. &ldquo;Oh come on, you&rsquo;ve been so snappy lately. And you&rsquo;ve been going on for hours last night telling mom how much work you still had to do for this big exam which is coming up. You&rsquo;ve been a stressed little chicken.&rdquo; She informed brightly, as if you should be happy she was sharing this with everyone. To be honest you just wanted to strangle her right now. There were many moments you wanted her to shut up, but now had definitely been the time. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? You didn&rsquo;t have to come, we could have met at your place when we were done with the tour.&quot;\u00a0He scolded, and even though you knew he meant well and he was happy to see you, his words still stung. You\u2019d put a lot of effort in all of this and you had tried very hard to be here tonight, to do good for others. You had wanted to please your sister by letting her meet her idols and you had wanted to surprise your boyfriend by showing up at his concert.</p><p>All of a sudden it seemed like all of that had been completely unnecessary. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve just been busy, that\u2019s all.\u201d You mumbled, trying to contain your voice. Actually you just wanted to throw all your frustrations out and yell at the both of them. You wanted to stomp your feet and you wanted to tell them not to judge you and be grateful that you sacrificed your time for them instead of being so annoying. But you told yourself that it wasn\u2019t worth it. Once you\u2019d start getting angry now, there was no more turning back. \u201cSo busy you haven\u2019t been eating well.\u201d Taehyung continued, causing you to grind your teeth in irritation. Couldn\u2019t he just let it go? Maybe you had been skipping some meals and maybe you had lost some weight because of all of the emotions you\u2019d been going through lately, but that didn\u2019t mean you hadn\u2019t been taking care of yourself. In your eyes you had been doing just fine, giving the circumstances. At least you still tried to sleep for at least eight hours a day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been a bit stressed, these exams are important to me.\u201d You cleared out, hoping that would be enough to shut him up. Yet, next to you, your sister sniffed, feeling way too much at home to your liking. \u201cI would call that a whole lot stressed if I were you.\u201d She clarified, making the frown on Taehyung\u2019s forehead deepen. How could she be such an idiot? Couldn\u2019t she see that she was only making things worse and she was only making him even more worried? She was just putting oil on a hot plate and you could tell it was about to catch fire. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just shut up for now.\u201d You spat in her direction, hoping that she would finally get the message and go find herself someone else to talk to. You didn\u2019t need her to be a part of this conversation right now. She held up her hands in defense before turning around and tripping towards the other side of the room. Your eyes followed her as she went to talk to Namjoon, who shot her a friendly smile. For a second Taehyung remained silent. He had probably figured out by now that he had pissed you off and that you were not happy. You didn\u2019t want to be judged because you cared so much about your education, you\u2019d spent enough hours worrying about it already. He still didn\u2019t say anything as he grabbed a hold your hand and pulled you out of the room with him. Ignoring the staff who walked around in the hallway he guided the both of you towards an empty room down the corridor, closing the door softly behind you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d He remarked, and even though deep down you knew that, you just couldn\u2019t help but feel defensive. It wasn\u2019t his fault and you didn\u2019t blame him for it, but he hadn\u2019t been there. He didn\u2019t have a clue about what the pas few weeks had been like for you, so he couldn\u2019t just go around throwing accusations at you. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been taking care of myself, I\u2019ve just been stressed. And yes, maybe I lost some weight, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve wanted it to happen. You\u2019re making it seem as if I chose for this.\u201d You growled, finding him quickly hushing you as he wrapped his arms around you for another supportive hug. It was able to calm you slightly, though you could still notice the fast beating of your heart. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I was just worried about you, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t want you to get ill.\u201d He explained, and you felt the tension in your shoulders drift away because of those words. Of course he worried about you. You knew everything about that feeling. You worried about his health so often, and then he was the one who would tell you not to exaggerate things. This time the roles had simply been reversed, and you weren\u2019t used to that.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJust a few more days, and then it\u2019ll all be over.\u201d You said, trying to sound positive. But the thought that you had to go through this for another seven days sounded like true torture. Yet, knowing that you\u2019d already lived through the worst of it made it slightly better. In the end you couldn\u2019t help but return his embrace, making sure to snake your arms around him tightly to let him know that he was forgiven. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great, you always do.\u201d He muttered supportingly, grabbing you by the shoulders and holding you an arm length away from him. You honestly had to admit you felt a lot better right now, knowing that he was here for you and that he understood. It all would have been a lot worse if this had led to a fight, adding even more stress to it all. \u201cI am really happy you\u2019re here.\u201d He assured you once more, placing both of his hands on your cheeks and putting another step closer to you. Noticing your own reflection inside of his eyes you couldn\u2019t help but smile. He was just too sweet. \u201cSo am I.\u201d You said, even though it hadn\u2019t seemed like it at first. This was much better than spending your time behind your text books, you would always choose this over studying if you had the chance.</p><p>A soft giggle escaped from your lips when his nose bumped into yours before his lips finally captured yours. You had really missed those. It happened the same way it always did when you two had been apart for some time. His kisses were sweet as honey, but soon grew hungry and were seeking for more. Before you knew it you were pressed up against the door, his lips roughly nipping at the side of your neck while his hands slipped down the side of your body. Though they didn\u2019t even get the chance to travel much further than that when all of a sudden a knock resounded on the door. \u201cHyung, your food is getting cold.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice resounded from the other side of the hallway and you knew that little devil was well aware of what he was doing right now. A sigh escaped against the side of your throat when before Taehyung pulled away. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right there.\u201d He replied, placing a peck on your forehead before taking a step back. \u201cLet\u2019s go get you something to eat.\u201d He said, shooting you a wink before he led the two of you back towards the dressing room.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/bts-masterlist\"></a><b>\u2219 BTS Masterlist <a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/%F0%9D%92%B7%F0%9D%93%89%F0%9D%93%88-%F0%9D%93%82%F0%9D%92%B6%F0%9D%93%88%F0%9D%93%89%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%93%87%F0%9D%93%81%F0%9D%92%BE%F0%9D%93%88%F0%9D%93%89\">\u2661</a><br/>\u2219 Masterlist <a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/Masterlist\">\u2661</a></b><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/Masterlist\"></a></p>",

You should be behind your desk right now, in some baggy clothing, pulling your hair out of your scalp. But instead you were hearing, enjoying some free time you didn\u2019t have. Just thinking about it almost caused you to get a mental break down. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to see BTS! How can I not be excited! This is big. All my friends will be so jealous.\u201d Your sister stated and you rolled your eyes at that. After being in a relationship with one of them for over a year it didn\u2019t really sound like anything special anymore. It sometimes caused you to forget that for others, it was a huge deal. To you they\u2019d simply become people, who walked around in their pajamas at the dorm and ate pizza for breakfast. But to your sister, they were gods. \u201cJust promise me you won\u2019t scream. If you\u2019ll scream I\u2019ll drag you straight out of there and we\u2019ll be heading straight home.\u201d You warned, and you watched the way she mocked you as you sent the car towards a parking lot at the back of the venue.\u00a0</p><p>Taehyung had told you to park here. It was usually reserved for cast members and staff, but he\u2019d made sure that after showing your passport the security guard would allow you to put your car there. You spotted the man a few feet away, but he immediately moved over once he noticed you. He had a scowl resting on his forehead, probably to shoo everyone away who wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. Quickly you got out your passport, and he read your name a few times before something seemed to hit him. \u201cPick a spot.\u201d He muttered, handing back your card before turning around and walking back towards the same spot he came from. \u201cJeez, he\u2019s in a great mood. Perhaps the two of you should spend some time together, maybe you can cheer each other up.\u201d Your sister joked, causing you to glare at her as you parked the car in an abandoned spot. She literally flew out of the door once you\u2019d turned down the engine. You wondered how much adrenaline was present in her blood right now, but you were sure it was a lot. Heaving a deep sigh you loosened your seat belt and grabbed your bag from the back seat before following her example and getting out.\u00a0</p><p>It was cold and it was raining softly, definitely not the kind of weather which made you feel any better. Still, you felt a certain amount of butterflies flutter through your stomach when the two of you gathered to walk towards the venue after you\u2019d locked the car. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d She asked as you opened the back door, where the two of you immediately ran into another set of security guards. This time around it didn\u2019t seem necessary for you to show them your passport, they let you pass without a word. \u201cYou look fine, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll really care about how you look. Just stay calm, don\u2019t drool and don\u2019t snap any pictures without asking them. No snapchat to show off with your friends. I want Taehyung to like you, I don\u2019t want him to think you\u2019re some psycho fan.\u201d You muttered as you walked through the warm hallways, searching for the dressing rooms. Taehyung had told you to step by an hour before the concert so the two of you could spend some time before the show. He\u2019d be too tired to do much afterwards and he didn\u2019t want to spend time with you in a boring hotel room. Even though you had asked him if your sister could come and he had said he didn\u2019t mind at all and he was excited to meet her, you were still a little worried. She could be very straight forward from time to time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t even notice I'l here. You just keep your attention to your boyfriend, I\u2019ll just whelm silently about how hot he is.\u201d She chuckled, and this time she managed to make a little smile appear on your face. She was an idiot and a handful, but she was great. You noticed her wiping her sweaty hands across her jeans as you stilled in front of a wooden door, which was firmly closed. You could only hope none of them were getting changed. Lifting your hand you knocked the door, waited for a loud reply of several voices colliding together and then opened it. \u201c_____________!\u201d Jimin spoke cheerfully as soon as you stepped inside. Smiling brightly you waved at him, watching him as he got up from his seat to hug you. You waved at them, realizing they were heaving a relaxing meal before the concert would start. Surprisingly you found your sister hiding behind you as he wrapped his arms around you and gave you a squeeze. Several greetings flew your way, until the boy in front of you was the first and who noticed you weren\u2019t alone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, you brought someone? Hi there!\u201d Jimin cheered, extending his hand to shake the one of the girl standing behind you. You bit back a grin when you saw the way her head turned bright red out of shyness. There was nothing left of her blunt behavior now. \u201cBabe.\u201d The word was low and soft inside of your head when all of a sudden two arms wrapped around you from behind. A wonderful warmth spread itself through your body because of the feeling. You knew it could only be one person. Leaning back against his warm chest you could feel the way he pressed a peck on top of your crown before he tried his best to turn you around so he could look at you. Teasing him you protested for a while, before giving into him anyway and spinning on your feet. As soon as his bright smile came into view it seemed as if the biggest part of your worries were fading and you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from diving in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d You stated, wrapping your arms around his neck and feeling the way his circles around your middle. It had been such a long time since you\u2019d seen him in person. You hated it whenever he was leaving for tour, because you knew it would and a great while before you would see him again. \u201cI missed you too. I\u2019m so glad you were able to come.\u201d He muttered, pressing his nose against the side of your face in a sweat gesture. His words instantly reminded you of all the reasons why you shouldn\u2019t be here, causing some of the excitement you felt to disappear. All those unfinished chapters, all those pages. Would you even be able to sleep before the exam or would you be busy all night trying to fix what was broken. The thought of failing made you want to cringe, it simply wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cHey, are you okay? You\u2019re so tense.\u201d Taehyung whispered softly and you could sense his hands digging into your back, touching all the muscles which had become sore by leaning over your books all day. Holding back a groan you pushed yourself away from him, steading yourself as you smiled at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my muscles we should worry about.\u201d After all you weren\u2019t the one who was preparing yourself to perform for the umpteenth time in a row. He was always busy and he was stressed so often, and besides all of that, he never complained. Your exams would be over in a week, you just had to hold on and then it would be over soon enough. Yet, it seemed like the thought had already taken master of his mind, making it impossible for him to let it go. \u201cHave you been taking care of yourself? You lost weight.\u201d He said, causing you to blink your eyes at him in surprise. He wasn\u2019t the one to notice those kinds of details all too quickly. It was something you hadn\u2019t even really noticed.\u00a0 Alright, it was easier for you to get into your jeans in the mornings, and maybe you hadn\u2019t been eating as frequently as you should, but apart from that you felt fine. You simply didn\u2019t have the time to spend a lot of time chit chatting with your mom over diner, so you usually ate while going through your notes. It had never seemed to be a problem to anyone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re imagining things. I\u2019m totally fine.\u201d You assured him, only to be interrupted by your sister, who suddenly showed up behind you. To be honest you\u2019d completely forgotten about her presence. \u201cOh come on, you\u2019ve been so snappy lately. And you\u2019ve been going on for hours last night telling mom how much work you still had to do for this big exam which is coming up. You\u2019ve been a stressed little chicken.\u201d She informed brightly, as if you should be happy she was sharing this with everyone. To be honest you just wanted to strangle her right now. There were many moments you wanted her to shut up, but now had definitely been the time. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? You didn\u2019t have to come, we could have met at your place when we were done with the tour.\"\u00a0He scolded, and even though you knew he meant well and he was happy to see you, his words still stung. You\u2019d put a lot of effort in all of this and you had tried very hard to be here tonight, to do good for others. You had wanted to please your sister by letting her meet her idols and you had wanted to surprise your boyfriend by showing up at his concert.</p><p>All of a sudden it seemed like all of that had been completely unnecessary. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve just been busy, that\u2019s all.\u201d You mumbled, trying to contain your voice. Actually you just wanted to throw all your frustrations out and yell at the both of them. You wanted to stomp your feet and you wanted to tell them not to judge you and be grateful that you sacrificed your time for them instead of being so annoying. But you told yourself that it wasn\u2019t worth it. Once you\u2019d start getting angry now, there was no more turning back. \u201cSo busy you haven\u2019t been eating well.\u201d Taehyung continued, causing you to grind your teeth in irritation. Couldn\u2019t he just let it go? Maybe you had been skipping some meals and maybe you had lost some weight because of all of the emotions you\u2019d been going through lately, but that didn\u2019t mean you hadn\u2019t been taking care of yourself. In your eyes you had been doing just fine, giving the circumstances. At least you still tried to sleep for at least eight hours a day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been a bit stressed, these exams are important to me.\u201d You cleared out, hoping that would be enough to shut him up. Yet, next to you, your sister sniffed, feeling way too much at home to your liking. \u201cI would call that a whole lot stressed if I were you.\u201d She clarified, making the frown on Taehyung\u2019s forehead deepen. How could she be such an idiot? Couldn\u2019t she see that she was only making things worse and she was only making him even more worried? She was just putting oil on a hot plate and you could tell it was about to catch fire. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just shut up for now.\u201d You spat in her direction, hoping that she would finally get the message and go find herself someone else to talk to. You didn\u2019t need her to be a part of this conversation right now. She held up her hands in defense before turning around and tripping towards the other side of the room. Your eyes followed her as she went to talk to Namjoon, who shot her a friendly smile. For a second Taehyung remained silent. He had probably figured out by now that he had pissed you off and that you were not happy. You didn\u2019t want to be judged because you cared so much about your education, you\u2019d spent enough hours worrying about it already. He still didn\u2019t say anything as he grabbed a hold your hand and pulled you out of the room with him. Ignoring the staff who walked around in the hallway he guided the both of you towards an empty room down the corridor, closing the door softly behind you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d He remarked, and even though deep down you knew that, you just couldn\u2019t help but feel defensive. It wasn\u2019t his fault and you didn\u2019t blame him for it, but he hadn\u2019t been there. He didn\u2019t have a clue about what the pas few weeks had been like for you, so he couldn\u2019t just go around throwing accusations at you. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been taking care of myself, I\u2019ve just been stressed. And yes, maybe I lost some weight, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve wanted it to happen. You\u2019re making it seem as if I chose for this.\u201d You growled, finding him quickly hushing you as he wrapped his arms around you for another supportive hug. It was able to calm you slightly, though you could still notice the fast beating of your heart. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I was just worried about you, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t want you to get ill.\u201d He explained, and you felt the tension in your shoulders drift away because of those words. Of course he worried about you. You knew everything about that feeling. You worried about his health so often, and then he was the one who would tell you not to exaggerate things. This time the roles had simply been reversed, and you weren\u2019t used to that.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust a few more days, and then it\u2019ll all be over.\u201d You said, trying to sound positive. But the thought that you had to go through this for another seven days sounded like true torture. Yet, knowing that you\u2019d already lived through the worst of it made it slightly better. In the end you couldn\u2019t help but return his embrace, making sure to snake your arms around him tightly to let him know that he was forgiven. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great, you always do.\u201d He muttered supportingly, grabbing you by the shoulders and holding you an arm length away from him. You honestly had to admit you felt a lot better right now, knowing that he was here for you and that he understood. It all would have been a lot worse if this had led to a fight, adding even more stress to it all. \u201cI am really happy you\u2019re here.\u201d He assured you once more, placing both of his hands on your cheeks and putting another step closer to you. Noticing your own reflection inside of his eyes you couldn\u2019t help but smile. He was just too sweet. \u201cSo am I.\u201d You said, even though it hadn\u2019t seemed like it at first. This was much better than spending your time behind your text books, you would always choose this over studying if you had the chance.</p><p>A soft giggle escaped from your lips when his nose bumped into yours before his lips finally captured yours. You had really missed those. It happened the same way it always did when you two had been apart for some time. His kisses were sweet as honey, but soon grew hungry and were seeking for more. Before you knew it you were pressed up against the door, his lips roughly nipping at the side of your neck while his hands slipped down the side of your body. Though they didn\u2019t even get the chance to travel much further than that when all of a sudden a knock resounded on the door. \u201cHyung, your food is getting cold.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice resounded from the other side of the hallway and you knew that little devil was well aware of what he was doing right now. A sigh escaped against the side of your throat when before Taehyung pulled away. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right there.\u201d He replied, placing a peck on your forehead before taking a step back. \u201cLet\u2019s go get you something to eat.\u201d He said, shooting you a wink before he led the two of you back towards the dressing room.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/bts-masterlist\"></a><b>\u2219 BTS Masterlist <a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/%F0%9D%92%B7%F0%9D%93%89%F0%9D%93%88-%F0%9D%93%82%F0%9D%92%B6%F0%9D%93%88%F0%9D%93%89%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%93%87%F0%9D%93%81%F0%9D%92%BE%F0%9D%93%88%F0%9D%93%89\">\u2661</a><br>\u2219 Masterlist <a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/Masterlist\">\u2661</a></b><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/Masterlist\"></a></p></p>",

I\u2019m trying to drive.\u201d You notified her and you saw the way your sister rolled your eyes at you before leaning back against the car seat. Usually you didn\u2019t have a problem taking her along on long drives, but tonight she was being extremely annoying. She kept on bouncing around in her seat and kept asking you how long it would take before you\u2019d arrive while the GPS indicated the exact hour. \u201cOh don\u2019t be so grumpy! As if you weren\u2019t nervous the first time you met them.\u201d She reminded you, causing a small smile to spread along your lips. She was right, but you would never openly admit that. You and Taehyung had met through a meet and greet after a concert and the be honest, you had barely even known the name BTS back then. You\u2019d simply been your friends diver because her mother had refused to give her a ride. Officially she had been grounded that night but since she\u2019s already bought the tickets her mom had agreed to let her go, on strict terms.\u00a0</p><p>You had simply been the one being dragged towards a concert of some kind of boy band you had never heard from while all you had wanted to do was sit by the window and drool over your handsome neighbor as he got changed in his bedroom and forgot to lower the blinds. You had never asked her to be a part of that whole scene. And when she had told you that she\u2019s won a meet an greet in some kind of radio contest, you had been miserably. Because you had been sure you were going to make a fool out of yourself and they would find out that you didn\u2019t even know them. They had found out, but they had rather seemed surprised than offended. And that was how you had met Taehyung. From the first moment you\u2019d walked into the room your eye had fallen on him, thanks to his handsome looks. But it seemed like the attraction had been mutual because he\u2019d asked you for your number before you left. And then one thing had let to another. Ever since you hadn\u2019t drooled over your neighbor once.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you should get us into a car accident! Now sit still, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d You warned her as you stilled the car in front of a red traffic light. You\u2019d promised your younger sister that you would take her to meet them one time, it seemed like that time had come. Yet, to you it couldn\u2019t have been a more inconvenient moment than this one. You were in the middle of exams and you had one one more day left before you\u2019d need to be done reviewing your notes. Time wasn\u2019t on your side right now, you surely didn\u2019t have plenty of it. But taehyung had sent you the tickets, leaving the decision to you if you would be able to come or not. But your sister had been clear, she thought she had waited long enough and it was time for her to see the guys. She used the excuse of her having to judge your boyfriend, checking if he was right for you. But you knew she was a fan and that she had a soft spot for Jimin, so that was just a facade. You really hoped she wouldn\u2019t faint. It wasn\u2019t like you weren\u2019t excited to see Taehyung, he\u2019d been away on tour for a while now and you\u2019d missed him. But right now just wasn\u2019t the right moment.\u00a0</p><p>In the back of your mind you couldn\u2019t stop thinking about all the things you still had to do, about the chapters you still had to read in your text book and the concepts you still had to memorize. You should be behind your desk right now, in some baggy clothing, pulling your hair out of your scalp. But instead you were hearing, enjoying some free time you didn\u2019t have. Just thinking about it almost caused you to get a mental break down. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to see BTS! How can I not be excited! This is big. All my friends will be so jealous.\u201d Your sister stated and you rolled your eyes at that. After being in a relationship with one of them for over a year it didn\u2019t really sound like anything special anymore. It sometimes caused you to forget that for others, it was a huge deal. To you they\u2019d simply become people, who walked around in their pajamas at the dorm and ate pizza for breakfast. But to your sister, they were gods. \u201cJust promise me you won\u2019t scream. If you\u2019ll scream I\u2019ll drag you straight out of there and we\u2019ll be heading straight home.\u201d You warned, and you watched the way she mocked you as you sent the car towards a parking lot at the back of the venue.\u00a0</p><p>Taehyung had told you to park here. It was usually reserved for cast members and staff, but he\u2019d made sure that after showing your passport the security guard would allow you to put your car there. You spotted the man a few feet away, but he immediately moved over once he noticed you. He had a scowl resting on his forehead, probably to shoo everyone away who wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. Quickly you got out your passport, and he read your name a few times before something seemed to hit him. \u201cPick a spot.\u201d He muttered, handing back your card before turning around and walking back towards the same spot he came from. \u201cJeez, he\u2019s in a great mood. Perhaps the two of you should spend some time together, maybe you can cheer each other up.\u201d Your sister joked, causing you to glare at her as you parked the car in an abandoned spot. She literally flew out of the door once you\u2019d turned down the engine. You wondered how much adrenaline was present in her blood right now, but you were sure it was a lot. Heaving a deep sigh you loosened your seat belt and grabbed your bag from the back seat before following her example and getting out.\u00a0</p><p>It was cold and it was raining softly, definitely not the kind of weather which made you feel any better. Still, you felt a certain amount of butterflies flutter through your stomach when the two of you gathered to walk towards the venue after you\u2019d locked the car. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d She asked as you opened the back door, where the two of you immediately ran into another set of security guards. This time around it didn\u2019t seem necessary for you to show them your passport, they let you pass without a word. \u201cYou look fine, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll really care about how you look. Just stay calm, don\u2019t drool and don\u2019t snap any pictures without asking them. No snapchat to show off with your friends. I want Taehyung to like you, I don\u2019t want him to think you\u2019re some psycho fan.\u201d You muttered as you walked through the warm hallways, searching for the dressing rooms. Taehyung had told you to step by an hour before the concert so the two of you could spend some time before the show. He\u2019d be too tired to do much afterwards and he didn\u2019t want to spend time with you in a boring hotel room. Even though you had asked him if your sister could come and he had said he didn\u2019t mind at all and he was excited to meet her, you were still a little worried. She could be very straight forward from time to time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t even notice I'l here. You just keep your attention to your boyfriend, I\u2019ll just whelm silently about how hot he is.\u201d She chuckled, and this time she managed to make a little smile appear on your face. She was an idiot and a handful, but she was great. You noticed her wiping her sweaty hands across her jeans as you stilled in front of a wooden door, which was firmly closed. You could only hope none of them were getting changed. Lifting your hand you knocked the door, waited for a loud reply of several voices colliding together and then opened it. \u201c_____________!\u201d Jimin spoke cheerfully as soon as you stepped inside. Smiling brightly you waved at him, watching him as he got up from his seat to hug you. You waved at them, realizing they were heaving a relaxing meal before the concert would start. Surprisingly you found your sister hiding behind you as he wrapped his arms around you and gave you a squeeze. Several greetings flew your way, until the boy in front of you was the first and who noticed you weren\u2019t alone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, you brought someone? Hi there!\u201d Jimin cheered, extending his hand to shake the one of the girl standing behind you. You bit back a grin when you saw the way her head turned bright red out of shyness. There was nothing left of her blunt behavior now. \u201cBabe.\u201d The word was low and soft inside of your head when all of a sudden two arms wrapped around you from behind. A wonderful warmth spread itself through your body because of the feeling. You knew it could only be one person. Leaning back against his warm chest you could feel the way he pressed a peck on top of your crown before he tried his best to turn you around so he could look at you. Teasing him you protested for a while, before giving into him anyway and spinning on your feet. As soon as his bright smile came into view it seemed as if the biggest part of your worries were fading and you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from diving in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d You stated, wrapping your arms around his neck and feeling the way his circles around your middle. It had been such a long time since you\u2019d seen him in person. You hated it whenever he was leaving for tour, because you knew it would and a great while before you would see him again. \u201cI missed you too. I\u2019m so glad you were able to come.\u201d He muttered, pressing his nose against the side of your face in a sweat gesture. His words instantly reminded you of all the reasons why you shouldn\u2019t be here, causing some of the excitement you felt to disappear. All those unfinished chapters, all those pages. Would you even be able to sleep before the exam or would you be busy all night trying to fix what was broken. The thought of failing made you want to cringe, it simply wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cHey, are you okay? You\u2019re so tense.\u201d Taehyung whispered softly and you could sense his hands digging into your back, touching all the muscles which had become sore by leaning over your books all day. Holding back a groan you pushed yourself away from him, steading yourself as you smiled at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my muscles we should worry about.\u201d After all you weren\u2019t the one who was preparing yourself to perform for the umpteenth time in a row. He was always busy and he was stressed so often, and besides all of that, he never complained. Your exams would be over in a week, you just had to hold on and then it would be over soon enough. Yet, it seemed like the thought had already taken master of his mind, making it impossible for him to let it go. \u201cHave you been taking care of yourself? You lost weight.\u201d He said, causing you to blink your eyes at him in surprise. He wasn\u2019t the one to notice those kinds of details all too quickly. It was something you hadn\u2019t even really noticed.\u00a0 Alright, it was easier for you to get into your jeans in the mornings, and maybe you hadn\u2019t been eating as frequently as you should, but apart from that you felt fine. You simply didn\u2019t have the time to spend a lot of time chit chatting with your mom over diner, so you usually ate while going through your notes. It had never seemed to be a problem to anyone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re imagining things. I\u2019m totally fine.\u201d You assured him, only to be interrupted by your sister, who suddenly showed up behind you. To be honest you\u2019d completely forgotten about her presence. \u201cOh come on, you\u2019ve been so snappy lately. And you\u2019ve been going on for hours last night telling mom how much work you still had to do for this big exam which is coming up. You\u2019ve been a stressed little chicken.\u201d She informed brightly, as if you should be happy she was sharing this with everyone. To be honest you just wanted to strangle her right now. There were many moments you wanted her to shut up, but now had definitely been the time. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? You didn\u2019t have to come, we could have met at your place when we were done with the tour.\"\u00a0He scolded, and even though you knew he meant well and he was happy to see you, his words still stung. You\u2019d put a lot of effort in all of this and you had tried very hard to be here tonight, to do good for others. You had wanted to please your sister by letting her meet her idols and you had wanted to surprise your boyfriend by showing up at his concert.</p><p>All of a sudden it seemed like all of that had been completely unnecessary. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve just been busy, that\u2019s all.\u201d You mumbled, trying to contain your voice. Actually you just wanted to throw all your frustrations out and yell at the both of them. You wanted to stomp your feet and you wanted to tell them not to judge you and be grateful that you sacrificed your time for them instead of being so annoying. But you told yourself that it wasn\u2019t worth it. Once you\u2019d start getting angry now, there was no more turning back. \u201cSo busy you haven\u2019t been eating well.\u201d Taehyung continued, causing you to grind your teeth in irritation. Couldn\u2019t he just let it go? Maybe you had been skipping some meals and maybe you had lost some weight because of all of the emotions you\u2019d been going through lately, but that didn\u2019t mean you hadn\u2019t been taking care of yourself. In your eyes you had been doing just fine, giving the circumstances. At least you still tried to sleep for at least eight hours a day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been a bit stressed, these exams are important to me.\u201d You cleared out, hoping that would be enough to shut him up. Yet, next to you, your sister sniffed, feeling way too much at home to your liking. \u201cI would call that a whole lot stressed if I were you.\u201d She clarified, making the frown on Taehyung\u2019s forehead deepen. How could she be such an idiot? Couldn\u2019t she see that she was only making things worse and she was only making him even more worried? She was just putting oil on a hot plate and you could tell it was about to catch fire. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just shut up for now.\u201d You spat in her direction, hoping that she would finally get the message and go find herself someone else to talk to. You didn\u2019t need her to be a part of this conversation right now. She held up her hands in defense before turning around and tripping towards the other side of the room. Your eyes followed her as she went to talk to Namjoon, who shot her a friendly smile. For a second Taehyung remained silent. He had probably figured out by now that he had pissed you off and that you were not happy. You didn\u2019t want to be judged because you cared so much about your education, you\u2019d spent enough hours worrying about it already. He still didn\u2019t say anything as he grabbed a hold your hand and pulled you out of the room with him. Ignoring the staff who walked around in the hallway he guided the both of you towards an empty room down the corridor, closing the door softly behind you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d He remarked, and even though deep down you knew that, you just couldn\u2019t help but feel defensive. It wasn\u2019t his fault and you didn\u2019t blame him for it, but he hadn\u2019t been there. He didn\u2019t have a clue about what the pas few weeks had been like for you, so he couldn\u2019t just go around throwing accusations at you. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been taking care of myself, I\u2019ve just been stressed. And yes, maybe I lost some weight, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve wanted it to happen. You\u2019re making it seem as if I chose for this.\u201d You growled, finding him quickly hushing you as he wrapped his arms around you for another supportive hug. It was able to calm you slightly, though you could still notice the fast beating of your heart. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I was just worried about you, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t want you to get ill.\u201d He explained, and you felt the tension in your shoulders drift away because of those words. Of course he worried about you. You knew everything about that feeling. You worried about his health so often, and then he was the one who would tell you not to exaggerate things. This time the roles had simply been reversed, and you weren\u2019t used to that.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust a few more days, and then it\u2019ll all be over.\u201d You said, trying to sound positive. But the thought that you had to go through this for another seven days sounded like true torture. Yet, knowing that you\u2019d already lived through the worst of it made it slightly better. In the end you couldn\u2019t help but return his embrace, making sure to snake your arms around him tightly to let him know that he was forgiven. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great, you always do.\u201d He muttered supportingly, grabbing you by the shoulders and holding you an arm length away from him. You honestly had to admit you felt a lot better right now, knowing that he was here for you and that he understood. It all would have been a lot worse if this had led to a fight, adding even more stress to it all. \u201cI am really happy you\u2019re here.\u201d He assured you once more, placing both of his hands on your cheeks and putting another step closer to you. Noticing your own reflection inside of his eyes you couldn\u2019t help but smile. He was just too sweet. \u201cSo am I.\u201d You said, even though it hadn\u2019t seemed like it at first. This was much better than spending your time behind your text books, you would always choose this over studying if you had the chance.</p><p>A soft giggle escaped from your lips when his nose bumped into yours before his lips finally captured yours. You had really missed those. It happened the same way it always did when you two had been apart for some time. His kisses were sweet as honey, but soon grew hungry and were seeking for more. Before you knew it you were pressed up against the door, his lips roughly nipping at the side of your neck while his hands slipped down the side of your body. Though they didn\u2019t even get the chance to travel much further than that when all of a sudden a knock resounded on the door. \u201cHyung, your food is getting cold.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice resounded from the other side of the hallway and you knew that little devil was well aware of what he was doing right now. A sigh escaped against the side of your throat when before Taehyung pulled away. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right there.\u201d He replied, placing a peck on your forehead before taking a step back. \u201cLet\u2019s go get you something to eat.\u201d He said, shooting you a wink before he led the two of you back towards the dressing room.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/bts-masterlist\"></a><b>\u2219 BTS Masterlist <a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/%F0%9D%92%B7%F0%9D%93%89%F0%9D%93%88-%F0%9D%93%82%F0%9D%92%B6%F0%9D%93%88%F0%9D%93%89%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%93%87%F0%9D%93%81%F0%9D%92%BE%F0%9D%93%88%F0%9D%93%89\">\u2661</a><br>\u2219 Masterlist <a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/Masterlist\">\u2661</a></b><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/Masterlist\"></a></p></p>",

I&rsquo;m trying to drive.&rdquo; You notified her and you saw the way your sister rolled your eyes at you before leaning back against the car seat. Usually you didn&rsquo;t have a problem taking her along on long drives, but tonight she was being extremely annoying. She kept on bouncing around in her seat and kept asking you how long it would take before you&rsquo;d arrive while the GPS indicated the exact hour. &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t be so grumpy! As if you weren&rsquo;t nervous the first time you met them.&rdquo; She reminded you, causing a small smile to spread along your lips. She was right, but you would never openly admit that. You and Taehyung had met through a meet and greet after a concert and the be honest, you had barely even known the name BTS back then. You&rsquo;d simply been your friends diver because her mother had refused to give her a ride. Officially she had been grounded that night but since she&rsquo;s already bought the tickets her mom had agreed to let her go, on strict terms.&nbsp;</p><p>You had simply been the one being dragged towards a concert of some kind of boy band you had never heard from while all you had wanted to do was sit by the window and drool over your handsome neighbor as he got changed in his bedroom and forgot to lower the blinds. You had never asked her to be a part of that whole scene. And when she had told you that she&rsquo;s won a meet an greet in some kind of radio contest, you had been miserably. Because you had been sure you were going to make a fool out of yourself and they would find out that you didn&rsquo;t even know them. They had found out, but they had rather seemed surprised than offended. And that was how you had met Taehyung. From the first moment you&rsquo;d walked into the room your eye had fallen on him, thanks to his handsome looks. But it seemed like the attraction had been mutual because he&rsquo;d asked you for your number before you left. And then one thing had let to another. Ever since you hadn&rsquo;t drooled over your neighbor once.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should get us into a car accident! Now sit still, we&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo; You warned her as you stilled the car in front of a red traffic light. You&rsquo;d promised your younger sister that you would take her to meet them one time, it seemed like that time had come. Yet, to you it couldn&rsquo;t have been a more inconvenient moment than this one. You were in the middle of exams and you had one one more day left before you&rsquo;d need to be done reviewing your notes. Time wasn&rsquo;t on your side right now, you surely didn&rsquo;t have plenty of it. But taehyung had sent you the tickets, leaving the decision to you if you would be able to come or not. But your sister had been clear, she thought she had waited long enough and it was time for her to see the guys. She used the excuse of her having to judge your boyfriend, checking if he was right for you. But you knew she was a fan and that she had a soft spot for Jimin, so that was just a facade. You really hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t faint. It wasn&rsquo;t like you weren&rsquo;t excited to see Taehyung, he&rsquo;d been away on tour for a while now and you&rsquo;d missed him. But right now just wasn&rsquo;t the right moment.&nbsp;</p><p>In the back of your mind you couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about all the things you still had to do, about the chapters you still had to read in your text book and the concepts you still had to memorize. You should be behind your desk right now, in some baggy clothing, pulling your hair out of your scalp. But instead you were hearing, enjoying some free time you didn&rsquo;t have. Just thinking about it almost caused you to get a mental break down. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to see BTS! How can I not be excited! This is big. All my friends will be so jealous.&rdquo; Your sister stated and you rolled your eyes at that. After being in a relationship with one of them for over a year it didn&rsquo;t really sound like anything special anymore. It sometimes caused you to forget that for others, it was a huge deal. To you they&rsquo;d simply become people, who walked around in their pajamas at the dorm and ate pizza for breakfast. But to your sister, they were gods. &ldquo;Just promise me you won&rsquo;t scream. If you&rsquo;ll scream I&rsquo;ll drag you straight out of there and we&rsquo;ll be heading straight home.&rdquo; You warned, and you watched the way she mocked you as you sent the car towards a parking lot at the back of the venue.&nbsp;</p><p>Taehyung had told you to park here. It was usually reserved for cast members and staff, but he&rsquo;d made sure that after showing your passport the security guard would allow you to put your car there. You spotted the man a few feet away, but he immediately moved over once he noticed you. He had a scowl resting on his forehead, probably to shoo everyone away who wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be here. Quickly you got out your passport, and he read your name a few times before something seemed to hit him. &ldquo;Pick a spot.&rdquo; He muttered, handing back your card before turning around and walking back towards the same spot he came from. &ldquo;Jeez, he&rsquo;s in a great mood. Perhaps the two of you should spend some time together, maybe you can cheer each other up.&rdquo; Your sister joked, causing you to glare at her as you parked the car in an abandoned spot. She literally flew out of the door once you&rsquo;d turned down the engine. You wondered how much adrenaline was present in her blood right now, but you were sure it was a lot. Heaving a deep sigh you loosened your seat belt and grabbed your bag from the back seat before following her example and getting out.&nbsp;</p><p>It was cold and it was raining softly, definitely not the kind of weather which made you feel any better. Still, you felt a certain amount of butterflies flutter through your stomach when the two of you gathered to walk towards the venue after you&rsquo;d locked the car. &ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; She asked as you opened the back door, where the two of you immediately ran into another set of security guards. This time around it didn&rsquo;t seem necessary for you to show them your passport, they let you pass without a word. &ldquo;You look fine, and it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ll really care about how you look. Just stay calm, don&rsquo;t drool and don&rsquo;t snap any pictures without asking them. No snapchat to show off with your friends. I want Taehyung to like you, I don&rsquo;t want him to think you&rsquo;re some psycho fan.&rdquo; You muttered as you walked through the warm hallways, searching for the dressing rooms. Taehyung had told you to step by an hour before the concert so the two of you could spend some time before the show. He&rsquo;d be too tired to do much afterwards and he didn&rsquo;t want to spend time with you in a boring hotel room. Even though you had asked him if your sister could come and he had said he didn&rsquo;t mind at all and he was excited to meet her, you were still a little worried. She could be very straight forward from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you won&rsquo;t even notice I'l here.

Would you even be able to sleep before the exam or would you be busy all night trying to fix what was broken. The thought of failing made you want to cringe, it simply wasn&rsquo;t an option. &ldquo;Hey, are you okay? You&rsquo;re so tense.&rdquo; Taehyung whispered softly and you could sense his hands digging into your back, touching all the muscles which had become sore by leaning over your books all day. Holding back a groan you pushed yourself away from him, steading yourself as you smiled at him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine!

It was something you hadn&rsquo;t even really noticed.&nbsp; Alright, it was easier for you to get into your jeans in the mornings, and maybe you hadn&rsquo;t been eating as frequently as you should, but apart from that you felt fine. You simply didn&rsquo;t have the time to spend a lot of time chit chatting with your mom over diner, so you usually ate while going through your notes.

He had probably figured out by now that he had pissed you off and that you were not happy. You didn&rsquo;t want to be judged because you cared so much about your education, you&rsquo;d spent enough hours worrying about it already. He still didn&rsquo;t say anything as he grabbed a hold your hand and pulled you out of the room with him. Ignoring the staff who walked around in the hallway he guided the both of you towards an empty room down the corridor, closing the door softly behind you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you.&rdquo; He remarked, and even though deep down you knew that, you just couldn&rsquo;t help but feel defensive. It wasn&rsquo;t his fault and you didn&rsquo;t blame him for it, but he hadn&rsquo;t been there. He didn&rsquo;t have a clue about what the pas few weeks had been like for you, so he couldn&rsquo;t just go around throwing accusations at you. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I haven&rsquo;t been taking care of myself, I&rsquo;ve just been stressed. And yes, maybe I lost some weight, but it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve wanted it to happen. You&rsquo;re making it seem as if I chose for this.&rdquo; You growled, finding him quickly hushing you as he wrapped his arms around you for another supportive hug. It was able to calm you slightly, though you could still notice the fast beating of your heart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant. I was just worried about you, that&rsquo;s all. I don&rsquo;t want you to get ill.&rdquo; He explained, and you felt the tension in your shoulders drift away because of those words. Of course he worried about you. You knew everything about that feeling. You worried about his health so often, and then he was the one who would tell you not to exaggerate things. This time the roles had simply been reversed, and you weren&rsquo;t used to that.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just a few more days, and then it&rsquo;ll all be over.&rdquo; You said, trying to sound positive. But the thought that you had to go through this for another seven days sounded like true torture. Yet, knowing that you&rsquo;d already lived through the worst of it made it slightly better. In the end you couldn&rsquo;t help but return his embrace, making sure to snake your arms around him tightly to let him know that he was forgiven. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll do great, you always do.&rdquo; He muttered supportingly, grabbing you by the shoulders and holding you an arm length away from him. You honestly had to admit you felt a lot better right now, knowing that he was here for you and that he understood. It all would have been a lot worse if this had led to a fight, adding even more stress to it all. &ldquo;I am really happy you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He assured you once more, placing both of his hands on your cheeks and putting another step closer to you. Noticing your own reflection inside of his eyes you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. He was just too sweet. &ldquo;So am I.&rdquo; You said, even though it hadn&rsquo;t seemed like it at first. This was much better than spending your time behind your text books, you would always choose this over studying if you had the chance.</p><p>A soft giggle escaped from your lips when his nose bumped into yours before his lips finally captured yours. You had really missed those. It happened the same way it always did when you two had been apart for some time. His kisses were sweet as honey, but soon grew hungry and were seeking for more. Before you knew it you were pressed up against the door, his lips roughly nipping at the side of your neck while his hands slipped down the side of your body. Though they didn&rsquo;t even get the chance to travel much further than that when all of a sudden a knock resounded on the door. &ldquo;Hyung, your food is getting cold.&rdquo; Jungkook&rsquo;s voice resounded from the other side of the hallway and you knew that little devil was well aware of what he was doing right now. A sigh escaped against the side of your throat when before Taehyung pulled away. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right there.&rdquo; He replied, placing a peck on your forehead before taking a step back. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go get you something to eat.&rdquo; He said, shooting you a wink before he led the two of you back towards the dressing room.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/bts-masterlist\"></a><b>&#8729; BTS Masterlist <a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/post/177692218575/%F0%9D%92%B7%F0%9D%93%89%F0%9D%93%88-%F0%9D%93%82%F0%9D%92%B6%F0%9D%93%88%F0%9D%93%89%F0%9D%91%92%F0%9D%93%87%F0%9D%93%81%F0%9D%92%BE%F0%9D%93%88%F0%9D%93%89\">&#9825;</a><br />&#8729; Masterlist <a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/Masterlist\">&#9825;</a></b><a href=\"https://yourdreamscenarios.tumblr.com/Masterlist\"></a></p></p>",

I&rsquo;m trying to drive.&rdquo; You notified her and you saw the way your sister rolled your eyes at you before leaning back against the car seat. Usually you didn&rsquo;t have a problem taking her along on long drives, but tonight she was being extremely annoying. She kept on bouncing around in her seat and kept asking you how long it would take before you&rsquo;d arrive while the GPS indicated the exact hour. &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t be so grumpy! As if you weren&rsquo;t nervous the first time you met them.&rdquo; She reminded you, causing a small smile to spread along your lips. She was right, but you would never openly admit that. You and Taehyung had met through a meet and greet after a concert and the be honest, you had barely even known the name BTS back then. You&rsquo;d simply been your friends diver because her mother had refused to give her a ride. Officially she had been grounded that night but since she&rsquo;s already bought the tickets her mom had agreed to let her go, on strict terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You had simply been the one being dragged towards a concert of some kind of boy band you had never heard from while all you had wanted to do was sit by the window and drool over your handsome neighbor as he got changed in his bedroom and forgot to lower the blinds. You had never asked her to be a part of that whole scene. And when she had told you that she&rsquo;s won a meet an greet in some kind of radio contest, you had been miserably. Because you had been sure you were going to make a fool out of yourself and they would find out that you didn&rsquo;t even know them. They had found out, but they had rather seemed surprised than offended. And that was how you had met Taehyung. From the first moment you&rsquo;d walked into the room your eye had fallen on him, thanks to his handsome looks. But it seemed like the attraction had been mutual because he&rsquo;d asked you for your number before you left. And then one thing had let to another. Ever since you hadn&rsquo;t drooled over your neighbor once.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
