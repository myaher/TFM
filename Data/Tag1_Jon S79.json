His muscled arms barely fitted in the orange camp shirt and Sansa stared at his broad back while she followed him outside.</p><p>Even though it was summer, the evening chill surprised her a little and she quickly wrapped her arms around herself to keep her from shivering while they walked away from the others, towards the lake. </p><p>When they reached the edge of the water Jon turned around and cocked his head. \u201cSo, what do you need my help with?\u201d</p><p>Sansa swallowed once more. \u201cI don\u2019t really need your help, I\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment and then she gathered all her courage and strength. \u201cWhen are you gonna ask me out, Jon?\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at her with wide open eyes. He opened his mouth to say something, but then he closed it again.</p><p>And the more minutes passed, the more awkward Sansa started to feel. </p><p>\u201cFine\u2026\u201d She eventually shook her head. \u201cForget it. Forget that I asked. Forget what I said. Let\u2019s not ruin our friendship.\u201d She already turned around to walk back to the dinner cabin, but then Jon curled his fingers around her wrist. </p><p>\u201cI was thinking about the when part of your question, not the dating part.\u201d Jon bent his head and Sansa froze. \u201cSo, is now as good a moment as any?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not as great a moment as a few weeks ago would have been, but it\u2019s far better than tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSansa Stark\u2026\u201d Jon cleared his throat. \u201cWould you like to go on a date with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cAfter all those hints I dropped, that\u2019s all your gonna ask?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought\u2026\u201d Jon paused and he scratched the back of his neck. \u201cSansa Stark\u2026\u201d He licked his lips and pulled her a little closer towards him. \u201cDo you want to be my girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile and then she freed herself from his embrace so she could curl her arms around his neck. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p></p>",
