Since the writers chose to make Wuffy a happy, mostly background couple the reason for their breakup will likely be mainly because Andi is uncomfortable. It\u2019s a good lesson for kids, that friendship is more important than boyfriends/girlfriends but if Wuffy doesn\u2019t have some conflict (other than right before they break up) it puts most of the blame on Andi.</p><!-- more --><p>This also would have been a great moment to showcase some platonic Jonah/Cyrus. It was a huge missed opportunity to separate these two from everyone else and only give them a few passing lines about Cyrus losing his paddle. We could\u2019ve gotten a scene where Cyrus, being the low-key nosey/eager to help friend he is, asks Jonah if he likes anyone else now that he and Andi are broken up. We know Andi asked Cyrus about it in the text app so maybe Cyrus seized his chance away from everyone to find out the truth. I don\u2019t think Jonah actually has a crush on anyone else but this would\u2019ve been an opportunity to really mislead the audience. Jonah, looking over towards the other canoes and refusing to answer, asks Cyrus the same question. Cyrus then says\u00a0\u201cI think&ndash;\u201d but before Cyrus can finish his sentence, they realize that while talking, they\u2019ve absentmindedly dropped both their paddles in the water. They then have to figure out how to get back to shore. Just to make it not exactly what Amber and Andi did, Cyrus probably freaks out while Jonah uses his arms to paddle awkwardly to shore. It isn\u2019t much but it would\u2019ve given the casual audience a chance to think <i>wait, does Cyrus like someone?</i></p><p>The B Plot: It makes no sense that Bex would be that against tasting cake. I get that she doesn\u2019t want a big fancy wedding but&hellip;it\u2019s cake. It seems like the <i>one</i>\u00a0wedding thing Bex would want to be involved in. You made one with Andi that time. We know you love cake. We all love cake. Anyway. Instead of after the canoe trip, <i>while</i> all that is happening\u00a0Bowie, Bex and Celia go cake tasting. Or, even better, Celia tells Bex and Bowie,</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I made you two a cake tasting appointment&hellip;What? I knew you weren\u2019t going to do it yourself. It\u2019s at 2:30 so you guys better get going!\u201d</p><p>Give them a montage, similar to Andi and CeCe\u2019s. Cue a few funny lines, feeding cake to each other and a similar shot of them feeling sick after consuming many a cake. They argue over which cake to pick, eventually choosing to do half one flavor and half the other.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Bex: Can we do that?</p><p>Bowie: It\u2019s our wedding, we can do whatever we want.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Andi comes home from the lake, initially upset,</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys went without me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to forgive in exchange for cake?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat depends, is it chocolate fudge?\u201d<br/></p><p>Bex and Bowie smile, \u201cOne of them is.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Cut the whole Shaun storyline from this episode and pick it back up again in a week or two when Jonah has time to be involved in it. Jonah could become Shaun\u2019s teacher/mentor (or he and Bowie could work together to encourage Shaun to tell his dad he doesn\u2019t want to play guitar).<br/></p>",

Also, I know it\u2019s supposed to be that Andi\u2019s jealous cuz she like Buffi but the entire episode read in an angsty Bandi way and if I didn\u2019t know for sure that there\u2019s no way in hell we\u2019re getting another lgbt+ story line, I would\u2019ve sworn that it looks like an Amber/Andi/Buffy love triangle. I mean, the Buffi angst was real this episode and I missed Ambi, we haven\u2019t gotten any content of them for a while now. Overall, everything with the younger actors was just gay as fuck.\u00a0</p><p>Bex doing Bowie\u2019s hair was cute and the Shaun story line, while definitely not worth 2 episodes and not particularly eye-catching was important. I loved the Celia/Andi dynamic in this episode and the entire cake deciding scene.
