Comment below!<br/>_______________________</b></p><p>He was a vampire.</p><p><br/>You were just a plain human.<br/><br/></p><p>It had been so long since he\u2019d been littered with affection (and mostly public affection). At first, you thought maybe he actually didn\u2019t like you, that maybe he would just drink your blood at some point and be done with you. It was a terrifying thought, though you\u2019d already grown fond of your vampire and wouldn\u2019t have minded that way of dying.\u00a0</p><p><br/>Sure, the other boys had tried something on you. Jimin had brought you flowers and food, Seokjin had cooked you endless amounts of food, while Namjoon filled your little room with books of poetry. Then there was Hoseok who\u2019d taken you out on moonlight walks, protecting you from the dangers of the dark. As well as Taehyung filling your lonely nights with funny jokes and pranks on people around you. Jeongguk had shied away from you at first, then realized he couldn\u2019t stay away. He\u2019d bring you the latest technology, having enough money to buy anything he wanted. You played games with him, and it was fun.<br/><br/>But, there was Yoongi.<br/>He cuddled you when you were most down, talked you through your pathetic problems and told you your life meant something. He praised you when you didn\u2019t hurt yourself, he cared for your wounds, and cleaned you up even if it hurt him to be around your blood. Your blood was rare, special. These seven boys had simply been passing by this town when they found you at some coffee shop. They knew they had to have you, and here they were. <br/><br/>At first, your fake confidence had immediately been taken down by Yoongi , who\u2019d pointed out your mask. Literally, the first day you met him.<br/><br/>Here you were, wanting to show your favorite vampire how much you cared, wanted, and even loved him. You both had started dating months ago, and you\u2019d taken your time getting closer to him. At first you\u2019d barely touch him arm - he said that was okay. Then your touches became lingering ones - he said that was okay. Then you\u2019d lean in a bit - he said that was okay. Time went on, and you\u2019d lean in to kiss him, but only with a scarf on. Recently, he\u2019d let you hug him. You\u2019d take each opportunity to hug him, though he really never responded. Even after all this time.<br/><br/>Today, you\u2019d made your way to their shared house. You knew none would hurt you, they even gave you a house key. So, you unlocked the door and slipped inside. You hung up your winter jacket, taking off your gloves, shoes, and scarf. You made your way through the large house, up to the top floor that housed Namjoon. You went to his door, knocking on it. You heard a low, <br/><br/>\u201cEnter, little human.\u201d<br/><br/>You smiled at this, not minding the toughness he held at times. You entered the room, closing the door behind you. A smile was still on your lips, and you made your way to the soft chair he had in the corner. He was at his desk, writing something obviously important so you waited till he was done. He turned himself towards you, hands in his lap. He raised an eyebrow at you, <br/><br/>\u201cYes?\u201d<br/><br/>You inhaled softly, relaxing into the chair shyly. <br/><br/>\u201cSorry for bothering you. I just wanted to talk about Yoongi.\u201d <br/><br/>His head leaned back a little, <br/><br/>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br/><br/>You bit your bottom lip a little before replying, <br/><br/>\u201cWell&hellip; I know it\u2019s hard for him to hug me and all. Though he doesn\u2019t seem to like it. Should I stop or &hellip; ? I want to kiss him too, but I\u2019m scared he won\u2019t like it. I\u2019m not exactly the nicest to kiss and I\u2019m not all that pretty, I\u2019m just an overweight piece of -\u201d<br/><br/>He cut you off with a wave of his hand. <br/><br/>\u201cHey. What did I tell you about talking like that about yourself? You\u2019re none of those things. You, my favorite human, are beautiful. Sure, you have extra, though that doesn\u2019t change anything. It\u2019s just more to love on, and I know for a fact Yoongi-ah enjoys your weight well.\u201d<br/><br/>This made your cheek tint with color, blood rushing. Yoongi had made comments to you prior to your relationship. All good ones too. He\u2019d give subtle compliments about your thighs, or how your stomach filled the shirt nicely. <br/><br/>\u201cWhat should I do, Joonie?\u201d You asked.<br/><br/>He gave a thoughtful look, leaning back into his chair. <br/><br/>\u201cYou know, he talks about you all the time. I know for a fact that Yoongi is much stronger than the rest of us. He\u2019s not going to hurt you, he\u2019s just never had someone in this day in age that loved giving affection to him. We came from a time where women never did things like hold hands or kiss in public. He just needs to get used to it. Let him. You might as well try kissing him too. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like it.\u201d<br/><br/>You\u2019d listened to each word, nodding at his last words. Maybe he would. If he was as strong as he said, then a kiss wouldn\u2019t be too hard on him. Right?<br/><br/>\u201cOkay, thank you, Joonie.\u201d <br/><br/>And thus with this, you got up and left the room with a quick ruffle to Namjoon\u2019s hair. Making sure you were out of his grasp and on Yoongi\u2019s floor. As you walked on you could hear faint piano music and so you approached Yoongi\u2019s piano room. You walked slowly, taking in each note. It was like a song to allure you in, and boy did it. Each note sounded like your whole life story. Most of it was sad, hurtful notes. It described the pain you went through, the pain all humans and creatures went through. You paused at the open door, shifting to lean against it as you watched Yoongi play from behind. \u00a0His arms move gracefully along the piano, each note played with precision. You listened, slowly walking up to him. You first reached out to him, though stopped yourself. His playing seized, only for him to say, <br/><br/>\u201cYou can touch me, I\u2019m okay.\u201d<br/><br/>His playing continued, and you slowly placed your warm hands upon his cool shoulders. You could feel his muscle move as his arms moved back and forth along the beautiful instrument. Music filled the air, and you listened right till the song was done. Your body shivered at the last note, your own shoulders tensing up a bit, only to relax once the trimmer was done. <br/><br/>\u201cThat was&hellip; Magnificent.\u201d You praised him, his body shifting to turn around. He stood up, your hands falling to your sides. <br/><br/>\u201cI wrote it for you.\u201d<br/><br/>He said this, your heart fluttering at the thought.<br/>It had sounded familiar to you. A song that only you\u2019d shared with him, and him only. Your eyes water and you looked away. He never touched you, just stood there watching you with a blank expression upon his features. There were moments when you could tell what he was thinking about, right now not being one of them. You shifted closer to him, pressing your chubby self to his slender form. You hugged him, sniffling while you tried keeping yourself together. You removed yourself quickly though, only for him to snatch a handout and pull you in. He leaned down, pressing his face to your hair. <br/><br/>\u201cHey &hellip; I missed you today.\u201d He mumbled this, your heart speeding up at this. Only he truly made you feel like a falling leaf, drifting endlessly through the air waiting for the fall and as it hits, all it is - is his arms.<br/><br/>\u201cI always miss you, Suga .\u201d <br/><br/>That was a nickname only you\u2019d called him. You\u2019d made nicknames for all of them, and this one stuck for Yoongi. You looked up at him through your long lashes, his own auburn hues dancing over your face. You reached up, cupping his cheek. Your short fingers fit smoothly to his flawless face.<br/><br/>You were a broken vase, and he was your beautiful rose that filled that empty space. <br/></p>",

You hung up your winter jacket, taking off your gloves, shoes, and scarf. You made your way through the large house, up to the top floor that housed Namjoon. You went to his door, knocking on it. You heard a low, <br><br>\u201cEnter, little human.\u201d<br><br>You smiled at this, not minding the toughness he held at times. You entered the room, closing the door behind you. A smile was still on your lips, and you made your way to the soft chair he had in the corner. He was at his desk, writing something obviously important so you waited till he was done. He turned himself towards you, hands in his lap. He raised an eyebrow at you, <br><br>\u201cYes?\u201d<br><br>You inhaled softly, relaxing into the chair shyly. <br><br>\u201cSorry for bothering you. I just wanted to talk about Yoongi.\u201d <br><br>His head leaned back a little, <br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br><br>You bit your bottom lip a little before replying, <br><br>\u201cWell\u2026 I know it\u2019s hard for him to hug me and all. Though he doesn\u2019t seem to like it. Should I stop or \u2026 ? I want to kiss him too, but I\u2019m scared he won\u2019t like it. I\u2019m not exactly the nicest to kiss and I\u2019m not all that pretty, I\u2019m just an overweight piece of -\u201d<br><br>He cut you off with a wave of his hand. <br><br>\u201cHey. What did I tell you about talking like that about yourself? You\u2019re none of those things. You, my favorite human, are beautiful. Sure, you have extra, though that doesn\u2019t change anything. It\u2019s just more to love on, and I know for a fact Yoongi-ah enjoys your weight well.\u201d<br><br>This made your cheek tint with color, blood rushing. Yoongi had made comments to you prior to your relationship. All good ones too. He\u2019d give subtle compliments about your thighs, or how your stomach filled the shirt nicely. <br><br>\u201cWhat should I do, Joonie?\u201d You asked.<br><br>He gave a thoughtful look, leaning back into his chair. <br><br>\u201cYou know, he talks about you all the time. I know for a fact that Yoongi is much stronger than the rest of us. He\u2019s not going to hurt you, he\u2019s just never had someone in this day in age that loved giving affection to him. We came from a time where women never did things like hold hands or kiss in public. He just needs to get used to it. Let him. You might as well try kissing him too. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like it.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019d listened to each word, nodding at his last words. Maybe he would. If he was as strong as he said, then a kiss wouldn\u2019t be too hard on him. Right?<br><br>\u201cOkay, thank you, Joonie.\u201d <br><br>And thus with this, you got up and left the room with a quick ruffle to Namjoon\u2019s hair. Making sure you were out of his grasp and on Yoongi\u2019s floor. As you walked on you could hear faint piano music and so you approached Yoongi\u2019s piano room. You walked slowly, taking in each note. It was like a song to allure you in, and boy did it. Each note sounded like your whole life story. Most of it was sad, hurtful notes. It described the pain you went through, the pain all humans and creatures went through. You paused at the open door, shifting to lean against it as you watched Yoongi play from behind. \u00a0His arms move gracefully along the piano, each note played with precision. You listened, slowly walking up to him. You first reached out to him, though stopped yourself. His playing seized, only for him to say, <br><br>\u201cYou can touch me, I\u2019m okay.\u201d<br><br>His playing continued, and you slowly placed your warm hands upon his cool shoulders. You could feel his muscle move as his arms moved back and forth along the beautiful instrument. Music filled the air, and you listened right till the song was done. Your body shivered at the last note, your own shoulders tensing up a bit, only to relax once the trimmer was done. <br><br>\u201cThat was\u2026 Magnificent.\u201d You praised him, his body shifting to turn around. He stood up, your hands falling to your sides. <br><br>\u201cI wrote it for you.\u201d<br><br>He said this, your heart fluttering at the thought.<br>It had sounded familiar to you. A song that only you\u2019d shared with him, and him only. Your eyes water and you looked away. He never touched you, just stood there watching you with a blank expression upon his features. There were moments when you could tell what he was thinking about, right now not being one of them. You shifted closer to him, pressing your chubby self to his slender form. You hugged him, sniffling while you tried keeping yourself together. You removed yourself quickly though, only for him to snatch a handout and pull you in. He leaned down, pressing his face to your hair. <br><br>\u201cHey \u2026 I missed you today.\u201d He mumbled this, your heart speeding up at this. Only he truly made you feel like a falling leaf, drifting endlessly through the air waiting for the fall and as it hits, all it is - is his arms.<br><br>\u201cI always miss you, Suga .\u201d <br><br>That was a nickname only you\u2019d called him. You\u2019d made nicknames for all of them, and this one stuck for Yoongi. You looked up at him through your long lashes, his own auburn hues dancing over your face. You reached up, cupping his cheek. Your short fingers fit smoothly to his flawless face.<br><br>You were a broken vase, and he was your beautiful rose that filled that empty space. <br></p>",
                "content": "<p><b> <b><br />Vampire!Min Yoongi x Reader</b><br /></b></p><p>\n\n<b>I wrote this a while back sometime in 2018.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if I should continue it. Comment below!<br />_______________________</b></p><p>He was a vampire.</p><p><br />You were just a plain human.<br /><br /></p><p>It had been so long since he&rsquo;d been littered with affection (and mostly public affection). At first, you thought maybe he actually didn&rsquo;t like you, that maybe he would just drink your blood at some point and be done with you. It was a terrifying thought, though you&rsquo;d already grown fond of your vampire and wouldn&rsquo;t have minded that way of dying.&nbsp;</p><p><br />Sure, the other boys had tried something on you. Jimin had brought you flowers and food, Seokjin had cooked you endless amounts of food, while Namjoon filled your little room with books of poetry. Then there was Hoseok who&rsquo;d taken you out on moonlight walks, protecting you from the dangers of the dark. As well as Taehyung filling your lonely nights with funny jokes and pranks on people around you. Jeongguk had shied away from you at first, then realized he couldn&rsquo;t stay away. He&rsquo;d bring you the latest technology, having enough money to buy anything he wanted. You played games with him, and it was fun.<br /><br />But, there was Yoongi.<br />He cuddled you when you were most down, talked you through your pathetic problems and told you your life meant something. He praised you when you didn&rsquo;t hurt yourself, he cared for your wounds, and cleaned you up even if it hurt him to be around your blood. Your blood was rare, special. These seven boys had simply been passing by this town when they found you at some coffee shop. They knew they had to have you, and here they were. <br /><br />At first, your fake confidence had immediately been taken down by Yoongi , who&rsquo;d pointed out your mask. Literally, the first day you met him.<br /><br />Here you were, wanting to show your favorite vampire how much you cared, wanted, and even loved him. You both had started dating months ago, and you&rsquo;d taken your time getting closer to him. At first you&rsquo;d barely touch him arm - he said that was okay. Then your touches became lingering ones - he said that was okay. Then you&rsquo;d lean in a bit - he said that was okay. Time went on, and you&rsquo;d lean in to kiss him, but only with a scarf on. Recently, he&rsquo;d let you hug him. You&rsquo;d take each opportunity to hug him, though he really never responded. Even after all this time.<br /><br />Today, you&rsquo;d made your way to their shared house. You knew none would hurt you, they even gave you a house key.

        "answer": "<p>Hey sweetie. </p><p>I touched on this briefly for hoseok in frozen, for him it would be you hurting on the inside. He lives for your physical pain but emotional distress is something he cant handle so now I&rsquo;ll do everyone else for you. </p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s kind of shit, my mind is blank for some reason. </p><h2>Jin</h2><p>I can picture that it would take you being ashamed of jin for him to feel sad. He prides himself his reputation and how others view him, he wants the two of you to be the idyllic couple that is envy of all others. If you were to find him embarrassing or shameful, he would be pretty torn up about it. </p><h2>Yoongi </h2><p>For yoongi it would be you choosing to be alone over being with him. He uses isolation to punish you because he knows you&rsquo;ll come running back to him, however, to see you preferring to be alone than to be with him would utterly destroy him. </p><h2>Namjoon </h2><p>For some reason, I can&rsquo;t think what would make namjoon sad. He seems to be far too above it all to get that upset over anything you said or did. Maybe seeing you too confused and insecure to even attempt to speak to him anymore would be what hurt him. He wants you to be less intelligent than him, he lives for the uncertainty in your voice and his ability to manipulate you but to see you so incredibly broken would send him perhaps as crazy as you. </p><h2>Jimin</h2><p>Jimin would be sad in much the same way as hoseok, if jimin saw you totally depressed and almost hollow, he would feel the same way. Jimin, in some ways, is less yandere than the others. Even just the way I write him, he&rsquo;s more of just an abusive boyfriend, so he&rsquo;s probably the most likely to correct his behaviour to see you happy. </p><h2>Taehyung</h2><p>Taehyung would feel sad if you hated him, being a yandere and treating you the way that he does, he knows you&rsquo;re going to hate him somewhat, but if you hated him with the burning intensity of a thousand desert suns, it would kill him. I cant see that he would change his behaviour like jimin though, the two of you would just have to live in a relationship filled with hate and dispair. </p><h2>Jungkook</h2><p>What would make jungkook sad, damn bitch, I really have no idea. He likes to see you afraid, he wants to own you entirely, just like taehyung does. I suppose the only way I could see him feeling sad is if you couldn&rsquo;t love him but found space inside of your fear laden heart, to love someone else. Knowing he can&rsquo;t make you love him is unbearable, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean he wont try to force you. Every second of every day for the rest of your lives, he would be trying to mould you into a partner that can be loved and give love. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"241\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dailyjeons:v1CIca9C09ckRn4ZoHqaVw:Zs1jsd2gBQokm\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67e78b88b7e1a77b1b7240d1146aaa9f/tumblr_pmqy3zk5lH1wq9bfzo1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"241\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure>",

He lives for your physical pain but emotional distress is something he cant handle so now I\u2019ll do everyone else for you. </p><p>I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s kind of shit, my mind is blank for some reason. </p><h2>Jin</h2><p>I can picture that it would take you being ashamed of jin for him to feel sad. He prides himself his reputation and how others view him, he wants the two of you to be the idyllic couple that is envy of all others. If you were to find him embarrassing or shameful, he would be pretty torn up about it. </p><h2>Yoongi </h2><p>For yoongi it would be you choosing to be alone over being with him. He uses isolation to punish you because he knows you\u2019ll come running back to him, however, to see you preferring to be alone than to be with him would utterly destroy him. </p><h2>Namjoon </h2><p>For some reason, I can\u2019t think what would make namjoon sad. He seems to be far too above it all to get that upset over anything you said or did. Maybe seeing you too confused and insecure to even attempt to speak to him anymore would be what hurt him. He wants you to be less intelligent than him, he lives for the uncertainty in your voice and his ability to manipulate you but to see you so incredibly broken would send him perhaps as crazy as you. </p><h2>Jimin</h2><p>Jimin would be sad in much the same way as hoseok, if jimin saw you totally depressed and almost hollow, he would feel the same way. Jimin, in some ways, is less yandere than the others. Even just the way I write him, he\u2019s more of just an abusive boyfriend, so he\u2019s probably the most likely to correct his behaviour to see you happy. </p><h2>Taehyung</h2><p>Taehyung would feel sad if you hated him, being a yandere and treating you the way that he does, he knows you\u2019re going to hate him somewhat, but if you hated him with the burning intensity of a thousand desert suns, it would kill him. I cant see that he would change his behaviour like jimin though, the two of you would just have to live in a relationship filled with hate and dispair. </p><h2>Jungkook</h2><p>What would make jungkook sad, damn bitch, I really have no idea. He likes to see you afraid, he wants to own you entirely, just like taehyung does. I suppose the only way I could see him feeling sad is if you couldn\u2019t love him but found space inside of your fear laden heart, to love someone else. Knowing he can\u2019t make you love him is unbearable, but it doesn\u2019t mean he wont try to force you. Every second of every day for the rest of your lives, he would be trying to mould you into a partner that can be loved and give love. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"241\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dailyjeons:v1CIca9C09ckRn4ZoHqaVw:Zs1jsd2gBQokm\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67e78b88b7e1a77b1b7240d1146aaa9f/tumblr_pmqy3zk5lH1wq9bfzo1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"241\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure></p>",
