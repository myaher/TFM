It was Gendry, the blacksmith who followed him behind the wall or should it be Lord Baratheon now. And by the soft glances they gave to each other, that they were not only sailing companion. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 -Aren\u2019t you the Lord of Storm\u2019s End?\u00a0</p><p>-I am well I was I gave this title to ser Davos.

Arya said in mind to reassure Jon</p><p>-Well, I\u2019m sure it will be the contrary. Your sister his strong. The strongest woman I\u2019ve ever met. added Gendry.I knew it the first time I saw her and she was dressed like a boy. Arya laughed. this is the main reason why I love her.</p><p>Jon and Sansa looked at each other, smiling at the fact that Gendry has no idea where he steps into.</p><p>At the word\u00a0\u201cwoman\u201d Jon realized that Arya was no longer the little girl he offered Needle to years ago. She was now a grown up, an adult and she will be fine. Gendry by her side, against the mysteries of the world.</p><p>The men on the boat waiting for Jon waved at him, it was time to go. He took a deep breath and look at his King brother and his sisters. This was goodbye and maybe forever. Then took one last glance at Gendry putting Arya closer to him with his arms and said\u00a0\u201cif my sister dies, I will kill you\u201d Gendry looked terrified and that made Arya laughed in between tears. Jon smiled one last time and jump into the boat. As they sailed away, Jon could see Sansa going with Brann and Gendry kissing Arya softly on her lips and go hand in hand as she was looking her beloved brother going further and further into the sea.\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>We didn\u2019t get any gendrya content on this last episode.

Honestly right now I wish I\u2019ve started years ago instead of waiting just because I thought that being spoiled for some events would ruin the experience for me. No matter what my opinion on this final episode is or even about this final season I loved it, I loved watching it, I loved the world loving it and the first seven season were some of the greatest seasons ever and the first six a true work of art and this show change tv and shows forever it\u2019ll always be the most popular show of this past few years and trying to take it\u2019s place will be hard because I think nothing will be quite as Game of Thrones when it comes to tv show like I think that no book will ever have the same impact as the Harry Potter series had all those years ago. </p><p>Now here comes my review. I stan Daenerys a lot, she was one of the character that made me curious about the series and one of the reason why I started to watch it. In this review I\u2019ll try to stay as neutral as possible separating my opinion as a Dany fan from my opinion as a fan of the show in general. </p><p>I\u2019m a bit disappointed by this finale, it\u2019s seem a bit underwhelming you know ? I expected so much, maybe too much, but at least not that. It was a surprise that\u2019s a good thing but a twist no one was coming and which doesn\u2019t make a lot of sens in my opinion. I expected more, I expected more conflict for the throne and a different ending for some of the characters (and not only Dany). As usual the visual, cinematography, pictures and music never disappoint like the actors never disappoint either. All of them are so good and talented and they all deserve more awards. Please give Emilia her Emmy this year thank you ! The all cast deserve to rule over the Emmy this year honestly at least for being in this show which change the culture forever. The ending as a all would probably be more satisfying if we had more episode. If this season was 10 episodes long instead of 6 maybe it would make more sense. </p><p>Now into the details</p><p>- Bran ?????? Like why ???? He has the best story ??? I\u2019m sorry but Sansa, Arya and Jon disagree (even Daenerys disagree before they made her the villain) I\u2019m sorry but it was so unexpected and he knew it would happened. So it means that he knew that all the King\u2019s Landing would be burn to the ground and that people would die but he didn\u2019t thought it would be a good idea to warm someone. Telling Sansa or Arya to seems more welcoming to Dany, tell Jon that he should be careful and not send armies to King\u2019s Landing right away. Tell Daenerys that she should never forget her first goal, protect the innocent and break the wheel. But now he didn\u2019t say anything and now he\u2019s king and maybe I would be a good king you know I got the bigger picture but still it\u2019s a bit underwhelming, he spend several season saying that he\u2019s not Bran anymore, that he\u2019s not human anymore that he doesn\u2019t want to be lord but suddenly he wants to be king. It\u2019s not even a bad idea technically but why not build it up better. He\u2019s the Stark we never really knew, the one that it\u2019s hard to cheer on because he seems so far from everything. Now all of the sudden everyone think he\u2019s fit to be king. Once again we needed more build up for that. </p><p>- Jon&hellip; So he\u2019s back to the start. Highlight he got to pet Ghost. You mean there were all this plot about him being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, that Daenerys\u2019s advisors betrayed her because they fought he should be on the throne and no one even speak his name during the lord meeting ? Like why make him a Targaryen then if his last name doesn\u2019t count. I get why I can\u2019t be king, why he doesn\u2019t want to but, he killed the woman he loved, he betrayed her it\u2019s just weird that this character journey end the same way it\u2019s started. Especially because the Unsullied leave Westeros like the Dothraki army don\u2019t stay in Westeros. And Grey Worm should realize that his queen didn\u2019t do the right thing by burning the city. So it was a let down for this character. </p><p>- Arya leaves. I feel conflicted about this. On one hand it\u2019s totally in character, she doesn\u2019t want to be a lady, she wants to explore the world and be more that what her statut could let her. But on the other hand it\u2019s weird she leaves her home so fast, that she doesn\u2019t even stay for her sister coronation or something like that. And what was the point of her romance with Gendry, she left Westeros, he\u2019s now lord, they probably will never see each other again. And did this romance bring something to her character ? No it made her seem cold and harsh toward someone she was supposed to love. I\u2019m actually happy about her exploring the world but in my opinion they could have done it differently, to make it more impactful. But you know it wasn&rsquo;t out of character at least that\u2019s that. </p><p>- I\u2019m actually glad that Grey Worm is going to Naath. I felt it could be an possible end for him but I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gonna do it. He couldn\u2019t stay in Westeros, he lost everything to this country, the love of his life and his queen who he placed all his hopes in. I\u2019m just sad he\u2019s so hard and unforgiving in this episode I get it but we could see a bit more dimension to his feelings. </p><p>- Tyrion is actually quite lucky. He survive, he ends up being the hand of the king. He\u2019s the last of the Lannister. We see how broken he is by the ruin of King\u2019s Landing and how he feels betrayed by Dany behavior. But maybe he could have done something, not at the end but before that to try to stop her hunger for power. But he\u2019s still one of my favorite character and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s alive and well. </p><p>- And here comes my heartbreak : Daenerys ending, not only her death because it seems there was no other options but her ending in general. Her speech to her army is a bit over the top. She won, she had the throne that\u2019s all she ever wanted she should try to rule even if she doesn\u2019t realize she made a huge mistake by killing all these innocents. It would seems a bit more like her I feel. But now she wants to keep going with war. And she is in the throne room, like in her dream which was expected. Then she has this conversation with Jon, about pulling together and changing the world and building a new one side by side and breaking the wheel. But it doesn\u2019t change that she killed thousands of people and Jon even if he loves her I can\u2019t stand by that. Their final scene is something I\u2019m conflicted with. Honestly I wish we saw her more than a few minutes in this episode, maybe Jon and Dany could have this conversation and Jon hesitate a bit, he sees she can\u2019t change and later they meet again and he kill her then. It would seem more build up, because technically Dany speech in this scene was quite innocent and peaceful, with hope laced in it and killing her at this moment seems a bit harsh. But it also showed that deep down she\u2019s still this hopeful girl who dream about making the world a better place seasons ago. Her death was heartbreaking, I mean I cried a lot, she dies, killed but the only person she still trusted. Probably the only person Drogon would have let pass. Her death seemed a mirror of Ygritte\u2019s one. Dying in the arms of the man they both love (maybe Jon shouldn\u2019t have any girlfriend it never ends well for them). We see Jon heartbreak, the only time since he learn that she\u2019s his aunt that we saw he still loved her a lot and that we feel he\u2019s gonna regret it all his life and that\u2019s he\u2019s gonna live with the guilt of killing the woman he loved. One of the best scene in this episode was Dragon discovering Dany is dead. How he tried to wake her up, his cries (poor baby dragon lost his brothers and his mother let me hug him please). The worst his we know all of the characters, even Jon will move on, but not Dragon he lost his mother and he has no one (I cried a lot during this scene). When he started to burn the Iron Throne it was beautiful, like he understood that what killed his mother was not Jon, but the throne. Because by the end her want for the throne killed her and seeing one of her children destroying the thing that caused her end was really beautiful. I wished we saw her in the final montage or at least Dragon and that she was mentioned a bit more in the rest of this episode. It\u2019s like she\u2019s erased from the memories</p><p>- Let\u2019s end with my favorite thing of this episode : Sansa being Queen in the North !!!! She deserved it so much !!! After everything she went through she deserve it, she deserve the respect of the North and their allegiance. She deserve everything and I\u2019m glad she got her happy ending. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s that powerful and she gonna be a great Queen, fair and juste and her coronation was one of the most beautiful scene in the episode. The final montage was beautiful and honestly I cried then too, because it really felt like the ending. </p><p>I still feel like the show and characters deserve better. Daenerys is one of the most iconic female character in fiction and she deserved better than this. For me a bittersweet ending would have been her fleeing Westeros, leaving her homeland, the promise of the throne and the man she loves behind in exchange for her live. Jon deserve a better ending too. They were the two leads and by the end it felt like all the time we spend with them wasn\u2019t that important. The Starks survive and for that at least I\u2019m grateful and Sansa got what she deserve : a throne. But in my head Sansa and Dany were both supposed to be the better part of Cersei. Sansa being smart and kind manipulative, always ready to scheme for what she thought was the right thing, but unless Cersei never putting her interest before everyone else and being a lot more patient and never underestimating her ennemies. And Dany was supposed to be the ambitious princess who wants to be queen and who know that it\u2019s her birthright to reign but never be cruel to her people and toward innocents and always trying to learn from her mistakes. They were supposed to be the proof that women can be ambitious without being villain. At least Sansa has achieve that and I always said that she should be Queen in the North.</p><p>I hope Brienne put her name in the book after writing Jamie\u2019s story. She deserve all the recognition she can have. </p><p>Finally I want to thank the actors and the crew who puts so much time and energy in this show. You did a great job and they should be proud of them because the only problems I have with this final season is the way the story is told not the rest. Emilia deserve better than seeing a character she loves so much and who gave her strength end up like that. In my head Daenerys will stay the woman she was until the final two episodes. </p><p>Thank You Game of Thrones for doing what you did. No matter the end it was a great experiencing this phenomenon with the rest of the world. </p><p>And now our watch has ended</p>",

It\u2019s like she\u2019s erased from the memories</p><p>- Let\u2019s end with my favorite thing of this episode : Sansa being Queen in the North !!!! She deserved it so much !!! After everything she went through she deserve it, she deserve the respect of the North and their allegiance. She deserve everything and I\u2019m glad she got her happy ending. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s that powerful and she gonna be a great Queen, fair and juste and her coronation was one of the most beautiful scene in the episode. The final montage was beautiful and honestly I cried then too, because it really felt like the ending. </p><p>I still feel like the show and characters deserve better. Daenerys is one of the most iconic female character in fiction and she deserved better than this. For me a bittersweet ending would have been her fleeing Westeros, leaving her homeland, the promise of the throne and the man she loves behind in exchange for her live. Jon deserve a better ending too. They were the two leads and by the end it felt like all the time we spend with them wasn\u2019t that important. The Starks survive and for that at least I\u2019m grateful and Sansa got what she deserve : a throne. But in my head Sansa and Dany were both supposed to be the better part of Cersei. Sansa being smart and kind manipulative, always ready to scheme for what she thought was the right thing, but unless Cersei never putting her interest before everyone else and being a lot more patient and never underestimating her ennemies. And Dany was supposed to be the ambitious princess who wants to be queen and who know that it\u2019s her birthright to reign but never be cruel to her people and toward innocents and always trying to learn from her mistakes. They were supposed to be the proof that women can be ambitious without being villain. At least Sansa has achieve that and I always said that she should be Queen in the North.</p><p>I hope Brienne put her name in the book after writing Jamie\u2019s story. She deserve all the recognition she can have. </p><p>Finally I want to thank the actors and the crew who puts so much time and energy in this show. You did a great job and they should be proud of them because the only problems I have with this final season is the way the story is told not the rest. Emilia deserve better than seeing a character she loves so much and who gave her strength end up like that. In my head Daenerys will stay the woman she was until the final two episodes. </p><p>Thank You Game of Thrones for doing what you did. No matter the end it was a great experiencing this phenomenon with the rest of the world. </p><p>And now our watch has ended</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Here comes my final review for Game of Thrones</p><p>Some context first, even if by being around the internet I knew a lot of things about the show I only started to watch it at the beginning of this year which explain that my opinion is probably not the same as the one I could have if I started to watch it years ago. Honestly right now I wish I\u2019ve started years ago instead of waiting just because I thought that being spoiled for some events would ruin the experience for me. No matter what my opinion on this final episode is or even about this final season I loved it, I loved watching it, I loved the world loving it and the first seven season were some of the greatest seasons ever and the first six a true work of art and this show change tv and shows forever it\u2019ll always be the most popular show of this past few years and trying to take it\u2019s place will be hard because I think nothing will be quite as Game of Thrones when it comes to tv show like I think that no book will ever have the same impact as the Harry Potter series had all those years ago. </p><p>Now here comes my review. I stan Daenerys a lot, she was one of the character that made me curious about the series and one of the reason why I started to watch it. In this review I\u2019ll try to stay as neutral as possible separating my opinion as a Dany fan from my opinion as a fan of the show in general. </p><p>I\u2019m a bit disappointed by this finale, it\u2019s seem a bit underwhelming you know ? I expected so much, maybe too much, but at least not that. It was a surprise that\u2019s a good thing but a twist no one was coming and which doesn\u2019t make a lot of sens in my opinion. I expected more, I expected more conflict for the throne and a different ending for some of the characters (and not only Dany). As usual the visual, cinematography, pictures and music never disappoint like the actors never disappoint either. All of them are so good and talented and they all deserve more awards. Please give Emilia her Emmy this year thank you ! The all cast deserve to rule over the Emmy this year honestly at least for being in this show which change the culture forever. The ending as a all would probably be more satisfying if we had more episode. If this season was 10 episodes long instead of 6 maybe it would make more sense. </p><p>Now into the details</p><p>- Bran ?????? Like why ???? He has the best story ??? I\u2019m sorry but Sansa, Arya and Jon disagree (even Daenerys disagree before they made her the villain) I\u2019m sorry but it was so unexpected and he knew it would happened. So it means that he knew that all the King\u2019s Landing would be burn to the ground and that people would die but he didn\u2019t thought it would be a good idea to warm someone. Telling Sansa or Arya to seems more welcoming to Dany, tell Jon that he should be careful and not send armies to King\u2019s Landing right away. Tell Daenerys that she should never forget her first goal, protect the innocent and break the wheel. But now he didn\u2019t say anything and now he\u2019s king and maybe I would be a good king you know I got the bigger picture but still it\u2019s a bit underwhelming, he spend several season saying that he\u2019s not Bran anymore, that he\u2019s not human anymore that he doesn\u2019t want to be lord but suddenly he wants to be king. It\u2019s not even a bad idea technically but why not build it up better. He\u2019s the Stark we never really knew, the one that it\u2019s hard to cheer on because he seems so far from everything. Now all of the sudden everyone think he\u2019s fit to be king. Once again we needed more build up for that. </p><p>- Jon\u2026 So he\u2019s back to the start. Highlight he got to pet Ghost. You mean there were all this plot about him being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, that Daenerys\u2019s advisors betrayed her because they fought he should be on the throne and no one even speak his name during the lord meeting ? Like why make him a Targaryen then if his last name doesn\u2019t count. I get why I can\u2019t be king, why he doesn\u2019t want to but, he killed the woman he loved, he betrayed her it\u2019s just weird that this character journey end the same way it\u2019s started. Especially because the Unsullied leave Westeros like the Dothraki army don\u2019t stay in Westeros. And Grey Worm should realize that his queen didn\u2019t do the right thing by burning the city. So it was a let down for this character. </p><p>- Arya leaves. I feel conflicted about this. On one hand it\u2019s totally in character, she doesn\u2019t want to be a lady, she wants to explore the world and be more that what her statut could let her. But on the other hand it\u2019s weird she leaves her home so fast, that she doesn\u2019t even stay for her sister coronation or something like that. And what was the point of her romance with Gendry, she left Westeros, he\u2019s now lord, they probably will never see each other again. And did this romance bring something to her character ? No it made her seem cold and harsh toward someone she was supposed to love. I\u2019m actually happy about her exploring the world but in my opinion they could have done it differently, to make it more impactful. But you know it wasn\u2019t out of character at least that\u2019s that. </p><p>- I\u2019m actually glad that Grey Worm is going to Naath. I felt it could be an possible end for him but I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gonna do it. He couldn\u2019t stay in Westeros, he lost everything to this country, the love of his life and his queen who he placed all his hopes in. I\u2019m just sad he\u2019s so hard and unforgiving in this episode I get it but we could see a bit more dimension to his feelings. </p><p>- Tyrion is actually quite lucky. He survive, he ends up being the hand of the king. He\u2019s the last of the Lannister. We see how broken he is by the ruin of King\u2019s Landing and how he feels betrayed by Dany behavior. But maybe he could have done something, not at the end but before that to try to stop her hunger for power. But he\u2019s still one of my favorite character and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s alive and well. </p><p>- And here comes my heartbreak : Daenerys ending, not only her death because it seems there was no other options but her ending in general. Her speech to her army is a bit over the top. She won, she had the throne that\u2019s all she ever wanted she should try to rule even if she doesn\u2019t realize she made a huge mistake by killing all these innocents. It would seems a bit more like her I feel. But now she wants to keep going with war. And she is in the throne room, like in her dream which was expected. Then she has this conversation with Jon, about pulling together and changing the world and building a new one side by side and breaking the wheel. But it doesn\u2019t change that she killed thousands of people and Jon even if he loves her I can\u2019t stand by that. Their final scene is something I\u2019m conflicted with. Honestly I wish we saw her more than a few minutes in this episode, maybe Jon and Dany could have this conversation and Jon hesitate a bit, he sees she can\u2019t change and later they meet again and he kill her then. It would seem more build up, because technically Dany speech in this scene was quite innocent and peaceful, with hope laced in it and killing her at this moment seems a bit harsh. But it also showed that deep down she\u2019s still this hopeful girl who dream about making the world a better place seasons ago. Her death was heartbreaking, I mean I cried a lot, she dies, killed but the only person she still trusted. Probably the only person Drogon would have let pass. Her death seemed a mirror of Ygritte\u2019s one. Dying in the arms of the man they both love (maybe Jon shouldn\u2019t have any girlfriend it never ends well for them). We see Jon heartbreak, the only time since he learn that she\u2019s his aunt that we saw he still loved her a lot and that we feel he\u2019s gonna regret it all his life and that\u2019s he\u2019s gonna live with the guilt of killing the woman he loved. One of the best scene in this episode was Dragon discovering Dany is dead. How he tried to wake her up, his cries (poor baby dragon lost his brothers and his mother let me hug him please). The worst his we know all of the characters, even Jon will move on, but not Dragon he lost his mother and he has no one (I cried a lot during this scene). When he started to burn the Iron Throne it was beautiful, like he understood that what killed his mother was not Jon, but the throne. Because by the end her want for the throne killed her and seeing one of her children destroying the thing that caused her end was really beautiful. I wished we saw her in the final montage or at least Dragon and that she was mentioned a bit more in the rest of this episode. It\u2019s like she\u2019s erased from the memories</p><p>- Let\u2019s end with my favorite thing of this episode : Sansa being Queen in the North !!!! She deserved it so much !!!
