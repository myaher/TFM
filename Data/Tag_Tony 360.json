After years and years and classes of Tony constantly rambling about how to use the operative system in the compound, it had finally proven to be useful. You easily hacked into F.R.I.D.A.Y. to capture Tony\u2019s extact location: Times Square.\u00a0</p><p>The chauffeur didn\u2019t object when you commanded he drove you to New York, either. Everything seemed to be going your way.\u00a0</p><p>Except for when you arrived at the scene.\u00a0</p><p>There were men in black everywhere, carrying weapons that looked potentially catastrophic. People shot weird looks at you as you ran the other way - straight into the lion\u2019s den.\u00a0</p><p>It didn\u2019t take you long to spot Hawkeye, up in the nearest roof, caught in a crossfire between Black Widow and three other men. You kept running up the street, hoping to get unnoticed within the chaos. It had yet to be determined what your mission was - there was one thing clear in your mind, and it was that you refused to stay behind while everyone else risked their lives.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d, a voice hissed behind you as you felt a strong arm grabbing you by the elbow.\u00a0</p><p>You immediately recognized Bucky\u2019s long hair,\u00a0\u201cI wanted to help\u201d, you replied rather shyly, seeing how agitated he was. Just as you spoke, a bomb exploded in a nearby alley. Bucky was quick to cover your body with his, causing you both to land on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>He helped you up with his metal arm,\u00a0\u201cGet the fuck out of here before Tony finds out\u201d, he commanded. You crossed your arms in front of your chest,\u00a0\u201cBucky, I can be helpful here\u201d, you said stubbornly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d, he pulled his mask down to get a proper look at you. You looked small, scared,\u00a0\u201cBy doing what, exactly? Getting yourself killed?\u201d, he saw the hurt look on your face, and his eyes softened.\u00a0</p><p>You rolled your eyes, brushing past him and into the streets again. You had had enough of people doubting your skills, your strenght. It was time to prove yourself to the team. You heard Bucky coming behind you,\u00a0\u201cLet me try\u201d, you told him, your voice barely a whispered.\u00a0</p><p>It seemed like years before he appeared by your side. His aura had somewhat changed,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m behind you\u201d, he looked at you in a way you couldn\u2019t quite descipher. You gave him a swift nod, and ran up the street.\u00a0</p><p>Tony Stark didn\u2019t know what else to do. Those men didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere near surrendering, and he was slowly growing tired of being stuck in the same situation. He eyed Peter, swinging from building to building, making sure civilians were safe. The kid was doing a good job.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStark!\u201d, a voice called him from the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., identificate that individual\u201d, he commanded. A few moments later, the computer responded,\u00a0\u201cOliver Keaton, member of HYDRA, potentially carrying weapons made of small quantities of Tesseract\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking great\u201d, the man cursed, descending from the heights until he was down in the middle of the road. He took off his mask,\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell do you want, Keaton?\u201d, his voice was firm, demanding.\u00a0</p><p>The man held tightly on the gun as his lips curved into a mischievous smile,\u00a0\u201cYou know what I want, <i>Iron Man</i>\u201d, he smirked.\u00a0</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes at him,\u00a0\u201cActually, I don\u2019t\u201d, he said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m actually quite tired - I have a bubble bath and a beautiful woman waiting for me at home, so I\u2019d appreaciate it if you just said what the fuck it is that you-\u201d</p><p>Tony was interrumpted by the loud pulling of the trigger, sending a blue, threatening laser of Tesseract energy his way. It all happened in slow motion for him - first, he watched in astonishment as his life flashed before his eyes. The next thing he knew, the laser had stopped barely a few inches away from his face.\u00a0</p><p>He was in a cold sweat as he looked over to his right, only to see you standing in the driveway, your hand aimed towards him, focused on the blue thing that had almost killed him. Oliver stood in shock, not really sure what was going on.\u00a0</p><p>Tony licked his lips,\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d, he half-whispered, still not moving from his spot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSaving your life, apparently\u201d, you talked back. You moved your hand in the direction of a wrecked truck nearby, sending the laser that way. The vehicle soon bursted into flames.\u00a0</p><p>He took a good look at you - your heart was beating fast, your hair and clothes were a mess due to the dust of the air, and you looked exhausted. However, he had never felt so proud.\u00a0</p><p>Oliver put the gun over his shoulder again,\u00a0\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve had enough of this family bullshit\u201d, he yelled before aiming at Tony again. The next thing he knew, the gun was no longer in his hands - but yours. You gave him a smirk,\u00a0\u201cNot today, Satan\u201d, you mumbled before you spotted Steve a few blocks away and levitated the weapon his way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine\u201d, Oliver was furious, and he had had enough. He spoke on his com-link,\u00a0\u201cGet the girl!\u201d, he shouted. Before you knew it, you heard gunshots coming your way. Tony suited up, shooting at every sniper his radar could catch.\u00a0</p><p>You started running the other way, feeling scared for the first time. They were coming for <i>you</i>.\u00a0</p><p>It all happened fast - a shouting voice, gunshots, and suddenly there was a lamppost flying your way,\u00a0\u201cParker, get my kid!\u201d, you heard Tony shout and, before you knew it, you let out the loudest scream as a mysterious figure picked you up and glued your body to his. You squinted your eyes, only to see that you were swinging from building to building above the city.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?!\u201d, you shouted, scared, hoping he would hear you so high up. You involuntaringly wrapped your arms around his torso, clinging for dear life. You looked up at his masked face - <i>Spiderman</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Of course you had heard about him - he was New York\u2019s new hero, the one everyone seemed to love so much. And you didn\u2019t know why, but there was something about his masked self that made you trust him. Maybe it was because he had just saved you from imminent death. Or maybe it was because his grip on your waist felt so extremely strong yet incredibly tender at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until you safely landed on a rooftop that the whole scene replayed on your head over and over again,\u00a0\u201cAre you okay?\u201d, he approached you carefuly, as if he were scared you\u2019d run away.\u00a0</p><p>Then, it hit you.\u00a0<i>  \u201cParker, get my kid!\u201d  </i></p><p>Without a hint of hesitation in your actions, you pulled his mask off of his face. Peter stared at you in shock,\u00a0\u201cPeter Parker?!\u201d, you watched him in awe as his eyes scanned yours,\u00a0\u201cThe intern? You\u2019re Spiderman?!\u201d</p><p>Peter gulped,\u00a0\u201cWell, you aren\u2019t completely clean yourself, either\u201d, he accused,\u00a0\u201cYou have telekinesis?!\u201d, he questioned, a hint of amazement in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>You felt your cheeks heating up,\u00a0\u201cWhatever\u201d, you brushed it off,\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re not really an intern\u201d, you crossed your arms in front of your chest, an amused smile on your face,\u00a0\u201cYou work with Tony? As an&hellip;Avenger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no\u201d, he was quick to respond. You felt kind of relieved - if that new kid was already an Avenger and you weren\u2019t, you would have a few words to exchange with Tony,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s just testing me, I think\u201d, he said, confused.\u00a0</p><p>You chuckled slightly,\u00a0\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to officially meet you for real, Spiderman\u201d, you extended your hand like he had done that morning, and he shook it. He gave you a toothy smile and you had to look down - <i>those damn curls</i>,\u00a0\u201cThank you for saving my life as well\u201d, you said, timidly. What the hell was wrong with you? You had never behaved like that.\u00a0</p><p>Peter scratched the back of his neck,\u00a0\u201cYeah, it was nothing, really\u201d, he stuttered,\u00a0\u201cI&hellip;I save people&hellip;that\u2019s what I do&hellip;Yeah\u201d</p><p>You caught yourself looking into his brown eyes, your stomach suddenly twisting. You felt sick - but not sick as in sick from eating Thor\u2019s dishes that he made with so much love, but tasted like everything\u00a0<i>but </i>love. It was an unknown, uncertain feeling.\u00a0</p><p>Tony was quick to land on the same rooftop, getting out of his suit as fast as he could and rushing to your side. He pulled you into a bone crushing hug, something he never did,\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d, he mumbled into your head. You buried your nose into his chest, taking in the scent of his cologne. You had been about to lose him.</p><p>Peter watched you with a warm smile,\u00a0\u201cThank you for saving her, kid\u201d, Tony spoke, and your eyes darted towards the boy. He looked proud,\u00a0\u201cIt was nothing, Mr. Stark\u201d, he spoke.\u00a0</p><p>Tony squeezed you one last time before finally releasing you from his grip,\u00a0\u201cAlright, you both\u201d, he pointed at the two of you,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re done for today. I\u2019ll have a car pick you up right this second. You\u2019ve done well\u201d, he said, putting a hand on your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll have a talk later\u201d, he whispered into your ear. However, it didn\u2019t sound as threatening as you would have imagined.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe you had proven yourself to the team, after all.\u00a0</p>",

Everything seemed to be going your way.\u00a0</p><p>Except for when you arrived at the scene.\u00a0</p><p>There were men in black everywhere, carrying weapons that looked potentially catastrophic. People shot weird looks at you as you ran the other way - straight into the lion\u2019s den.\u00a0</p><p>It didn\u2019t take you long to spot Hawkeye, up in the nearest roof, caught in a crossfire between Black Widow and three other men. You kept running up the street, hoping to get unnoticed within the chaos. It had yet to be determined what your mission was - there was one thing clear in your mind, and it was that you refused to stay behind while everyone else risked their lives.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d, a voice hissed behind you as you felt a strong arm grabbing you by the elbow.\u00a0</p><p>You immediately recognized Bucky\u2019s long hair,\u00a0\u201cI wanted to help\u201d, you replied rather shyly, seeing how agitated he was. Just as you spoke, a bomb exploded in a nearby alley. Bucky was quick to cover your body with his, causing you both to land on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>He helped you up with his metal arm,\u00a0\u201cGet the fuck out of here before Tony finds out\u201d, he commanded. You crossed your arms in front of your chest,\u00a0\u201cBucky, I can be helpful here\u201d, you said stubbornly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d, he pulled his mask down to get a proper look at you. You looked small, scared,\u00a0\u201cBy doing what, exactly? Getting yourself killed?\u201d, he saw the hurt look on your face, and his eyes softened.\u00a0</p><p>You rolled your eyes, brushing past him and into the streets again. You had had enough of people doubting your skills, your strenght. It was time to prove yourself to the team. You heard Bucky coming behind you,\u00a0\u201cLet me try\u201d, you told him, your voice barely a whispered.\u00a0</p><p>It seemed like years before he appeared by your side. His aura had somewhat changed,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m behind you\u201d, he looked at you in a way you couldn\u2019t quite descipher. You gave him a swift nod, and ran up the street.\u00a0</p><p>Tony Stark didn\u2019t know what else to do. Those men didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere near surrendering, and he was slowly growing tired of being stuck in the same situation. He eyed Peter, swinging from building to building, making sure civilians were safe. The kid was doing a good job.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStark!\u201d, a voice called him from the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., identificate that individual\u201d, he commanded. A few moments later, the computer responded,\u00a0\u201cOliver Keaton, member of HYDRA, potentially carrying weapons made of small quantities of Tesseract\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking great\u201d, the man cursed, descending from the heights until he was down in the middle of the road. He took off his mask,\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell do you want, Keaton?\u201d, his voice was firm, demanding.\u00a0</p><p>The man held tightly on the gun as his lips curved into a mischievous smile,\u00a0\u201cYou know what I want, <i>Iron Man</i>\u201d, he smirked.\u00a0</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes at him,\u00a0\u201cActually, I don\u2019t\u201d, he said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m actually quite tired - I have a bubble bath and a beautiful woman waiting for me at home, so I\u2019d appreaciate it if you just said what the fuck it is that you-\u201d</p><p>Tony was interrumpted by the loud pulling of the trigger, sending a blue, threatening laser of Tesseract energy his way. It all happened in slow motion for him - first, he watched in astonishment as his life flashed before his eyes. The next thing he knew, the laser had stopped barely a few inches away from his face.\u00a0</p><p>He was in a cold sweat as he looked over to his right, only to see you standing in the driveway, your hand aimed towards him, focused on the blue thing that had almost killed him. Oliver stood in shock, not really sure what was going on.\u00a0</p><p>Tony licked his lips,\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d, he half-whispered, still not moving from his spot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSaving your life, apparently\u201d, you talked back. You moved your hand in the direction of a wrecked truck nearby, sending the laser that way. The vehicle soon bursted into flames.\u00a0</p><p>He took a good look at you - your heart was beating fast, your hair and clothes were a mess due to the dust of the air, and you looked exhausted. However, he had never felt so proud.\u00a0</p><p>Oliver put the gun over his shoulder again,\u00a0\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve had enough of this family bullshit\u201d, he yelled before aiming at Tony again. The next thing he knew, the gun was no longer in his hands - but yours. You gave him a smirk,\u00a0\u201cNot today, Satan\u201d, you mumbled before you spotted Steve a few blocks away and levitated the weapon his way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine\u201d, Oliver was furious, and he had had enough. He spoke on his com-link,\u00a0\u201cGet the girl!\u201d, he shouted. Before you knew it, you heard gunshots coming your way. Tony suited up, shooting at every sniper his radar could catch.\u00a0</p><p>You started running the other way, feeling scared for the first time. They were coming for <i>you</i>.\u00a0</p><p>It all happened fast - a shouting voice, gunshots, and suddenly there was a lamppost flying your way,\u00a0\u201cParker, get my kid!\u201d, you heard Tony shout and, before you knew it, you let out the loudest scream as a mysterious figure picked you up and glued your body to his. You squinted your eyes, only to see that you were swinging from building to building above the city.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?!\u201d, you shouted, scared, hoping he would hear you so high up. You involuntaringly wrapped your arms around his torso, clinging for dear life. You looked up at his masked face - <i>Spiderman</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Of course you had heard about him - he was New York\u2019s new hero, the one everyone seemed to love so much. And you didn\u2019t know why, but there was something about his masked self that made you trust him. Maybe it was because he had just saved you from imminent death. Or maybe it was because his grip on your waist felt so extremely strong yet incredibly tender at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until you safely landed on a rooftop that the whole scene replayed on your head over and over again,\u00a0\u201cAre you okay?\u201d, he approached you carefuly, as if he were scared you\u2019d run away.\u00a0</p><p>Then, it hit you.\u00a0<i>  \u201cParker, get my kid!\u201d  </i></p><p>Without a hint of hesitation in your actions, you pulled his mask off of his face. Peter stared at you in shock,\u00a0\u201cPeter Parker?!\u201d, you watched him in awe as his eyes scanned yours,\u00a0\u201cThe intern? You\u2019re Spiderman?!\u201d</p><p>Peter gulped,\u00a0\u201cWell, you aren\u2019t completely clean yourself, either\u201d, he accused,\u00a0\u201cYou have telekinesis?!\u201d, he questioned, a hint of amazement in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>You felt your cheeks heating up,\u00a0\u201cWhatever\u201d, you brushed it off,\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re not really an intern\u201d, you crossed your arms in front of your chest, an amused smile on your face,\u00a0\u201cYou work with Tony? As an\u2026Avenger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no\u201d, he was quick to respond. You felt kind of relieved - if that new kid was already an Avenger and you weren\u2019t, you would have a few words to exchange with Tony,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s just testing me, I think\u201d, he said, confused.\u00a0</p><p>You chuckled slightly,\u00a0\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to officially meet you for real, Spiderman\u201d, you extended your hand like he had done that morning, and he shook it. He gave you a toothy smile and you had to look down - <i>those damn curls</i>,\u00a0\u201cThank you for saving my life as well\u201d, you said, timidly. What the hell was wrong with you? You had never behaved like that.\u00a0</p><p>Peter scratched the back of his neck,\u00a0\u201cYeah, it was nothing, really\u201d, he stuttered,\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I save people\u2026that\u2019s what I do\u2026Yeah\u201d</p><p>You caught yourself looking into his brown eyes, your stomach suddenly twisting. You felt sick - but not sick as in sick from eating Thor\u2019s dishes that he made with so much love, but tasted like everything\u00a0<i>but </i>love. It was an unknown, uncertain feeling.\u00a0</p><p>Tony was quick to land on the same rooftop, getting out of his suit as fast as he could and rushing to your side. He pulled you into a bone crushing hug, something he never did,\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d, he mumbled into your head. You buried your nose into his chest, taking in the scent of his cologne. You had been about to lose him.</p><p>Peter watched you with a warm smile,\u00a0\u201cThank you for saving her, kid\u201d, Tony spoke, and your eyes darted towards the boy. He looked proud,\u00a0\u201cIt was nothing, Mr. Stark\u201d, he spoke.\u00a0</p><p>Tony squeezed you one last time before finally releasing you from his grip,\u00a0\u201cAlright, you both\u201d, he pointed at the two of you,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re done for today. I\u2019ll have a car pick you up right this second. You\u2019ve done well\u201d, he said, putting a hand on your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll have a talk later\u201d, he whispered into your ear. However, it didn\u2019t sound as threatening as you would have imagined.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe you had proven yourself to the team, after all.\u00a0</p></p>",

After years and years and classes of Tony constantly rambling about how to use the operative system in the compound, it had finally proven to be useful. You easily hacked into F.R.I.D.A.Y. to capture Tony&rsquo;s extact location: Times Square.&nbsp;</p><p>The chauffeur didn&rsquo;t object when you commanded he drove you to New York, either. Everything seemed to be going your way.&nbsp;</p><p>Except for when you arrived at the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>There were men in black everywhere, carrying weapons that looked potentially catastrophic. People shot weird looks at you as you ran the other way - straight into the lion&rsquo;s den.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take you long to spot Hawkeye, up in the nearest roof, caught in a crossfire between Black Widow and three other men. You kept running up the street, hoping to get unnoticed within the chaos. It had yet to be determined what your mission was - there was one thing clear in your mind, and it was that you refused to stay behind while everyone else risked their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck are you doing here?&rdquo;, a voice hissed behind you as you felt a strong arm grabbing you by the elbow.&nbsp;</p><p>You immediately recognized Bucky&rsquo;s long hair,&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted to help&rdquo;, you replied rather shyly, seeing how agitated he was. Just as you spoke, a bomb exploded in a nearby alley. Bucky was quick to cover your body with his, causing you both to land on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>He helped you up with his metal arm,&nbsp;&ldquo;Get the fuck out of here before Tony finds out&rdquo;, he commanded. You crossed your arms in front of your chest,&nbsp;&ldquo;Bucky, I can be helpful here&rdquo;, you said stubbornly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo;, he pulled his mask down to get a proper look at you. You looked small, scared,&nbsp;&ldquo;By doing what, exactly? Getting yourself killed?&rdquo;, he saw the hurt look on your face, and his eyes softened.&nbsp;</p><p>You rolled your eyes, brushing past him and into the streets again. You had had enough of people doubting your skills, your strenght. It was time to prove yourself to the team. You heard Bucky coming behind you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me try&rdquo;, you told him, your voice barely a whispered.&nbsp;</p><p>It seemed like years before he appeared by your side. His aura had somewhat changed,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m behind you&rdquo;, he looked at you in a way you couldn&rsquo;t quite descipher. You gave him a swift nod, and ran up the street.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony Stark didn&rsquo;t know what else to do. Those men didn&rsquo;t seem to be anywhere near surrendering, and he was slowly growing tired of being stuck in the same situation. He eyed Peter, swinging from building to building, making sure civilians were safe. The kid was doing a good job.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stark!&rdquo;, a voice called him from the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y., identificate that individual&rdquo;, he commanded. A few moments later, the computer responded,&nbsp;&ldquo;Oliver Keaton, member of HYDRA, potentially carrying weapons made of small quantities of Tesseract&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking great&rdquo;, the man cursed, descending from the heights until he was down in the middle of the road. He took off his mask,&nbsp;&ldquo;What the hell do you want, Keaton?&rdquo;, his voice was firm, demanding.&nbsp;</p><p>The man held tightly on the gun as his lips curved into a mischievous smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;You know what I want, <i>Iron Man</i>&rdquo;, he smirked.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes at him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, I don&rsquo;t&rdquo;, he said,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually quite tired - I have a bubble bath and a beautiful woman waiting for me at home, so I&rsquo;d appreaciate it if you just said what the fuck it is that you-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony was interrumpted by the loud pulling of the trigger, sending a blue, threatening laser of Tesseract energy his way. It all happened in slow motion for him - first, he watched in astonishment as his life flashed before his eyes. The next thing he knew, the laser had stopped barely a few inches away from his face.&nbsp;</p><p>He was in a cold sweat as he looked over to his right, only to see you standing in the driveway, your hand aimed towards him, focused on the blue thing that had almost killed him. Oliver stood in shock, not really sure what was going on.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony licked his lips,&nbsp;&ldquo;What the hell are you doing here?&rdquo;, he half-whispered, still not moving from his spot.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Saving your life, apparently&rdquo;, you talked back. You moved your hand in the direction of a wrecked truck nearby, sending the laser that way. The vehicle soon bursted into flames.&nbsp;</p><p>He took a good look at you - your heart was beating fast, your hair and clothes were a mess due to the dust of the air, and you looked exhausted. However, he had never felt so proud.&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver put the gun over his shoulder again,&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ve had enough of this family bullshit&rdquo;, he yelled before aiming at Tony again. The next thing he knew, the gun was no longer in his hands - but yours. You gave him a smirk,&nbsp;&ldquo;Not today, Satan&rdquo;, you mumbled before you spotted Steve a few blocks away and levitated the weapon his way.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine&rdquo;, Oliver was furious, and he had had enough. He spoke on his com-link,&nbsp;&ldquo;Get the girl!&rdquo;, he shouted. Before you knew it, you heard gunshots coming your way. Tony suited up, shooting at every sniper his radar could catch.&nbsp;</p><p>You started running the other way, feeling scared for the first time. They were coming for <i>you</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>It all happened fast - a shouting voice, gunshots, and suddenly there was a lamppost flying your way,&nbsp;&ldquo;Parker, get my kid!&rdquo;, you heard Tony shout and, before you knew it, you let out the loudest scream as a mysterious figure picked you up and glued your body to his. You squinted your eyes, only to see that you were swinging from building to building above the city.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell are you?!&rdquo;, you shouted, scared, hoping he would hear you so high up. You involuntaringly wrapped your arms around his torso, clinging for dear life. You looked up at his masked face - <i>Spiderman</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course you had heard about him - he was New York&rsquo;s new hero, the one everyone seemed to love so much. And you didn&rsquo;t know why, but there was something about his masked self that made you trust him. Maybe it was because he had just saved you from imminent death. Or maybe it was because his grip on your waist felt so extremely strong yet incredibly tender at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until you safely landed on a rooftop that the whole scene replayed on your head over and over again,&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;, he approached you carefuly, as if he were scared you&rsquo;d run away.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, it hit you.&nbsp;<i>  &ldquo;Parker, get my kid!&rdquo;  </i></p><p>Without a hint of hesitation in your actions, you pulled his mask off of his face. Peter stared at you in shock,&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter Parker?!&rdquo;, you watched him in awe as his eyes scanned yours,&nbsp;&ldquo;The intern? You&rsquo;re Spiderman?!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gulped,&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you aren&rsquo;t completely clean yourself, either&rdquo;, he accused,&nbsp;&ldquo;You have telekinesis?!&rdquo;, he questioned, a hint of amazement in his voice.&nbsp;</p><p>You felt your cheeks heating up,&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever&rdquo;, you brushed it off,&nbsp;&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re not really an intern&rdquo;, you crossed your arms in front of your chest, an amused smile on your face,&nbsp;&ldquo;You work with Tony? As an&hellip;Avenger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no&rdquo;, he was quick to respond. You felt kind of relieved - if that new kid was already an Avenger and you weren&rsquo;t, you would have a few words to exchange with Tony,&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just testing me, I think&rdquo;, he said, confused.&nbsp;</p><p>You chuckled slightly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s nice to officially meet you for real, Spiderman&rdquo;, you extended your hand like he had done that morning, and he shook it. He gave you a toothy smile and you had to look down - <i>those damn curls</i>,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you for saving my life as well&rdquo;, you said, timidly. What the hell was wrong with you? You had never behaved like that.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter scratched the back of his neck,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, it was nothing, really&rdquo;, he stuttered,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip;I save people&hellip;that&rsquo;s what I do&hellip;Yeah&rdquo;</p><p>You caught yourself looking into his brown eyes, your stomach suddenly twisting. You felt sick - but not sick as in sick from eating Thor&rsquo;s dishes that he made with so much love, but tasted like everything&nbsp;<i>but </i>love. It was an unknown, uncertain feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony was quick to land on the same rooftop, getting out of his suit as fast as he could and rushing to your side. He pulled you into a bone crushing hug, something he never did,&nbsp;&ldquo;What the hell were you thinking?&rdquo;, he mumbled into your head. You buried your nose into his chest, taking in the scent of his cologne. You had been about to lose him.</p><p>Peter watched you with a warm smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you for saving her, kid&rdquo;, Tony spoke, and your eyes darted towards the boy. He looked proud,&nbsp;&ldquo;It was nothing, Mr. Stark&rdquo;, he spoke.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony squeezed you one last time before finally releasing you from his grip,&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, you both&rdquo;, he pointed at the two of you,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re done for today.

He <em>does</em> find some loose glitter, though, and a lipstick he wore for Pride and had thought he&rsquo;d lost, plus a spare Metro Card he can&rsquo;t remember buying.</p><p>He also gets a crystal clear flashback of leaving the umbrella under his desk to dry yesterday morning, and never picking it up again.</p><p>Words: 1979, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Captain%20America%20(Movies)/works\" target=\"_blank\">Captain America (Movies)</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Teen%20And%20Up%20Audiences/works\" target=\"_blank\">Teen And Up Audiences</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/No%20Archive%20Warnings%20Apply/works\" target=\"_blank\">No Archive Warnings Apply</a></li><li>Categories: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/M*s*M/works\" target=\"_blank\">M/M</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark</a></li><li>Relationships: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20%22Bucky%22%20Barnes*s*Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">James &ldquo;Bucky&rdquo; Barnes/Steve Rogers</a></li><li>Additional Tags: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Captain%20America%20Steve%20Rogers*s*Modern%20Bucky%20Barnes/works\" target=\"_blank\">Captain America Steve Rogers/Modern Bucky Barnes</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Meet-Cute/works\" target=\"_blank\">Meet-Cute</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Bearded%20Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Bearded Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Social%20disaster%20Bucky%20Barnes/works\" target=\"_blank\">Social disaster Bucky Barnes</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Fluff%20and%20Humor/works\" target=\"_blank\">Fluff and Humor</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Chivalry%20Is%20Not%20Dead%20If%20There's%20A%20Hot%20Twunk%20In%20Need:%20By%20Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Chivalry Is Not Dead If There&rsquo;s A Hot Twunk In Need: By Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Damsels%20in%20Distress/works\" target=\"_blank\">Damsels in Distress</a></li></ul><br /><br />\nread it on the AO3 at <strong><a href=\"https://ift.tt/2MK3aVh\" target=\"_blank\">https://ift.tt/2MK3aVh</a></strong></p>",
