        "answer": "<p>These are such good questions - thank you!\u00a0</p><p>(Buckle up, because this answer is going to be a long one.)\u00a0</p><p><b><i>Thoughts on Thor in Endgame - Spoilers ahead obviously!</i></b>\u00a0</p><p>Most of my answer to this question comes from an answer I\u2019d written on Quora, but I\u2019ve added a few things as well. Thor has always been my favorite Avenger, and even before that he was always my favorite Norse god, so I\u2019m really happy to answer this one.</p><p>I know people have a lot of feelings about the movie, and I haven\u2019t actually had a chance to write about my own feelings on it much. But one of the things I enjoyed most about Endgame was that everyone got a chance to do something that made their arc complete, for better or worse - i.e</p><ul><li>Steve\u2019s dance and his happy ending</li><li>Natasha sacrificing herself and finally wiping the red out of her ledger</li><li>Clint being willing to sacrifice himself and seeing the error of his ways as Ronin</li><li>Tony getting to have a few years of domestic bliss and being able to have one last positive conversation with his dad before he selflessly saved the world by giving his own life</li><li>Bruce and Hulk coming to a peaceful agreement to coexist</li></ul><p>But my favorite of those moments was Thor\u2019s visit to 2013 Asgard.\u00a0</p><p>Up to this point in the movie, Thor has been severely depressed. Though he pretends to be indifferent, it\u2019s painfully obvious that he\u2019s still suffering from all the trauma he\u2019s been through in the last few years (not least of which was losing everyone he loved and failing in his fight with Thanos). His depression shows in his physical appearance and his mental attitude.\u00a0</p><p>Even when he gets to 2013 Asgard, he doesn\u2019t initially have the motivation to carry out the mission he\u2019s supposed to. It isn\u2019t until Frigga notices him and offers her listening ear that Thor is forced to confront his feelings. His mother, the person who knows him the best, is the one that helps Thor work through those feelings, and I think it\u2019s brilliantly done. Unlike with his friends, Thor is more willing to talk to his mother about how he feels (and for good reason - who <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> feel comfortable confiding in Frigga?).\u00a0</p><p>He gets a chance to talk about what happened to him without fear of being judged or ridiculed. He knows his mother won\u2019t think less of him because he failed at something - and she doesn\u2019t. In fact, she gives him some really good advice in relation to that:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to stop being who you\u2019re supposed to be, and start being who you are.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a simple bit of dialogue, but very powerful, and it gives Thor the confidence he needs to get himself together.\u00a0</p><p>In just that short span of time that he had a chance to talk to his mother, she helps him realize that he is still valuable, and more than that, he\u2019s equal to the task he needs to perform. That confidence boost inspires him to call for his hammer.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nMj\u00f6lnir immediately flies into his hand. Softly, with glee, he says,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still worthy!\u201d It was enough to break my heart in the best way possible, and probably my favorite line of dialogue in the whole three hour movie. From that point on, we see Thor get his mojo back, and it\u2019s beautiful. I think it was a great way to round out his arc if that\u2019s what they\u2019re choosing to do.

Sure, he talks about it a little bit in Infinity War, but for me it just wasn\u2019t enough. I want to see more than just a passing shot of Titan in all its glory.

I want the scene he described, of him going to the leaders of his home and presenting his\u00a0\u201ckill half of the population\u201d idea. I want to see the thought process that led to this madness in action. And most of all, I want scenes of him traveling from world to world with his children, committing mass genocide unchecked.

Thor has always been my favorite Avenger, and even before that he was always my favorite Norse god, so I\u2019m really happy to answer this one.</p><p>I know people have a lot of feelings about the movie, and I haven\u2019t actually had a chance to write about my own feelings on it much.

Though he pretends to be indifferent, it\u2019s painfully obvious that he\u2019s still suffering from all the trauma he\u2019s been through in the last few years (not least of which was losing everyone he loved and failing in his fight with Thanos). His depression shows in his physical appearance and his mental attitude.\u00a0</p><p>Even when he gets to 2013 Asgard, he doesn\u2019t initially have the motivation to carry out the mission he\u2019s supposed to. It isn\u2019t until Frigga notices him and offers her listening ear that Thor is forced to confront his feelings. His mother, the person who knows him the best, is the one that helps Thor work through those feelings, and I think it\u2019s brilliantly done. Unlike with his friends, Thor is more willing to talk to his mother about how he feels (and for good reason - who <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> feel comfortable confiding in Frigga?).\u00a0</p><p>He gets a chance to talk about what happened to him without fear of being judged or ridiculed. He knows his mother won\u2019t think less of him because he failed at something - and she doesn\u2019t. In fact, she gives him some really good advice in relation to that:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to stop being who you\u2019re supposed to be, and start being who you are.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a simple bit of dialogue, but very powerful, and it gives Thor the confidence he needs to get himself together.\u00a0</p><p>In just that short span of time that he had a chance to talk to his mother, she helps him realize that he is still valuable, and more than that, he\u2019s equal to the task he needs to perform. That confidence boost inspires him to call for his hammer.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nMj\u00f6lnir immediately flies into his hand. Softly, with glee, he says,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still worthy!\u201d It was enough to break my heart in the best way possible, and probably my favorite line of dialogue in the whole three hour movie. From that point on, we see Thor get his mojo back, and it\u2019s beautiful. I think it was a great way to round out his arc if that\u2019s what they\u2019re choosing to do.

The difference between Thanos and Loki is that we got Loki\u2019s\u00a0\u201corigin story\u201d from the first Thor movie - it helped us understand who he was and where he came from, and it showed us how he ended up on the path that led him to where he was in the first Avengers movie.\u00a0</p><p>With Thanos, we really get no such backstory. Sure, he talks about it a little bit in Infinity War, but for me it just wasn\u2019t enough. I want to see more than just a passing shot of Titan in all its glory.

I want the scene he described, of him going to the leaders of his home and presenting his\u00a0\u201ckill half of the population\u201d idea. I want to see the thought process that led to this madness in action. And most of all, I want scenes of him traveling from world to world with his children, committing mass genocide unchecked.
