        "body": "<h1>GOT S8 EPISODE 4 - Spoilers and Theories</h1><p>This is just a list of thoughts I have so far:</p><p>1. JON SNOW KNOWS NOTHING: how does he just throw his whole Stark identity out of the window like that? Telling \u201chis brother and sisters\u201d they are practically nothing. Is like Lyanna\u2019s ancestry doesn\u2019t weigh on his. He is still a Stark. I understand he was raised to feel inferior but he was always proud of Ned and loved his singlings. And why the fuck does he just dismissed Ghost like that? Ghost is in his fucking sword! Is he gonna have it reshaped to be a Dragon now? Ugh \ud83d\ude11 I think the whole Ghost thing is either foreshadowing Jon\u2019s return to the Night Watch or even beyond the wall or his lost identity that will be his downfall&hellip; as Sansa mentioned on this episode: \u201cStark men dont do well in the South\u201d. He does not deserve the Iron Throne even though every one keeps shoving it down his throat. I\u2019m done with Jon/Aegon. What is he thinking: he doesn\u2019t identify as a Stark, he said he loved Dany but still went ahead and told the other Starks their secret&hellip; uuugggh. The worst is that he is the only character who doesn\u2019t want to live and I think he is going to make it until he dies of old age \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p><p>2. SANSA WTF? Selfish little Sansa&hellip; I loved her moment with The Hound, her moment saying good bye to Theon but that\u2019s it. She\u2019s the new Littlefinger, but I dont think she really wants the Throne, she just wants some sort of justice for the North. However, what she just triggered by telling Tyrion is going to reshape the whole story. And I think in the end the North will be the new capital and she will be the new queen but won\u2019t be happy&hellip; she\u2019ll mirror Cersei and Littlefinger in many things.</p><p>3. DANY&hellip; I am convinced now that she will be indeed go full Mad Queen. After all that she\u2019s lost (2 Dragons, her best friend and her loyal protector plus the entire Dotraki army and like 75% of the Unsullied) only to see how a man takes all the credit is definitely going to take a toll on her mental state. She meant well by trying to be righteous and destroying the wheel but now she\u2019s all about revenge. She doesn\u2019t really trust the people around her anymore and she\u2019s been held back many many times&hellip; I\u2019m sure she will do whatever she wants and this will trigger Varys to act against her. However, I really think Jon will kill her, a new Queen Slayer and this will be her 3rd betrayal. I think Drogon is gonna burn the hell out of Euron.</p><p>4. VARYS AND TYRION: I can see Dany executing both of them for conspiracy. And then Dany will suspect Jon as well because he was the one who told Sansa the truth. Maybe Tyrion could survive but I\u2019m not so sure.</p><p>5. JAMIE and CERSEI&hellip; I truly want to believe he is going back to Kings Landing to try to fix things with Cersei, and try to convince her of running away together or something. I could see Cersei killing him for being a traitor, for leaving her and accusing him of the loss of their unborn child. She\u2019s paranoid so I think that once she sees herself loosing, she will kill herself by Jamie\u2019s corpse side. Very Romeo and Juliette like.</p><p>6. ARYA&hellip; it was very on point for her to refuse Gendry on those terms of being a lady at a castle. I think she will help the Hound kill the Mountain and finally giving the Hound the gift of mercy. Afterall she\u2019s regained contact with her humanity. I do see her going back to Storm\u2019s End and being with Gendry but as a Master of arms or something on her own terms and him of course supporting her.</p><p>7. BRIENNE AND POD: I can see Brienne as the hand of Sansa and Pod as a Knight. Also, there\u2019s room for Brienne to be having Jaimies twins. Afterall, it was kind of foreshadowed during thr drinking game by bringin up thr fact that she was an only child and a virgin.</p><p>8. Sam: I\u2019m not sure if Sam\u2019s role was just to read about dragon glass killing the white walkers but I\u2019m sure he will write everything that happened on that night and will go back to his family\u2019s castle.</p><p>9. Bran: I\u2019m sure his line to Tyrion about being too much in the past will pay off. There\u2019s still some kind of twist coming for Bran. Probably to open room for the spin off series.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>My bittersweet ending would be: </p><p>Dany\u2019s dream of ending with corruption ends dead along with her. Jon bitter and alive at The Wall, back to his roots. Sansa alone being the lady that conquered it all with her smarts but is still alone and unhappy, nit necesarily a bad leader but hinting shades of the past ruthlessness. Brienne with the things she never thought could achieve (a family, knighthood, etc) but still suffering by the toll it took. And new generations growing up in spring (Sam, Brienne, Arya\u2019s kids)&hellip; maybe Drogon will fly off and lay new eggs but will someone be able to hatch them? And finally Bran, dwelling in the past by the weirwood tree.</p><p>_________</p><p><br/></p><p>Overall I think the producers underestimated this last season.

Is like Lyanna\u2019s ancestry doesn\u2019t weigh on his. He is still a Stark. I understand he was raised to feel inferior but he was always proud of Ned and loved his singlings. And why the fuck does he just dismissed Ghost like that? Ghost is in his fucking sword! Is he gonna have it reshaped to be a Dragon now? Ugh \ud83d\ude11 I think the whole Ghost thing is either foreshadowing Jon\u2019s return to the Night Watch or even beyond the wall or his lost identity that will be his downfall\u2026 as Sansa mentioned on this episode: \u201cStark men dont do well in the South\u201d. He does not deserve the Iron Throne even though every one keeps shoving it down his throat. I\u2019m done with Jon/Aegon. What is he thinking: he doesn\u2019t identify as a Stark, he said he loved Dany but still went ahead and told the other Starks their secret\u2026 uuugggh. The worst is that he is the only character who doesn\u2019t want to live and I think he is going to make it until he dies of old age \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p><p>2. SANSA WTF? Selfish little Sansa\u2026 I loved her moment with The Hound, her moment saying good bye to Theon but that\u2019s it. She\u2019s the new Littlefinger, but I dont think she really wants the Throne, she just wants some sort of justice for the North. However, what she just triggered by telling Tyrion is going to reshape the whole story. And I think in the end the North will be the new capital and she will be the new queen but won\u2019t be happy\u2026 she\u2019ll mirror Cersei and Littlefinger in many things.</p><p>3. DANY\u2026 I am convinced now that she will be indeed go full Mad Queen. After all that she\u2019s lost (2 Dragons, her best friend and her loyal protector plus the entire Dotraki army and like 75% of the Unsullied) only to see how a man takes all the credit is definitely going to take a toll on her mental state. She meant well by trying to be righteous and destroying the wheel but now she\u2019s all about revenge. She doesn\u2019t really trust the people around her anymore and she\u2019s been held back many many times\u2026 I\u2019m sure she will do whatever she wants and this will trigger Varys to act against her. However, I really think Jon will kill her, a new Queen Slayer and this will be her 3rd betrayal. I think Drogon is gonna burn the hell out of Euron.</p><p>4. VARYS AND TYRION: I can see Dany executing both of them for conspiracy. And then Dany will suspect Jon as well because he was the one who told Sansa the truth. Maybe Tyrion could survive but I\u2019m not so sure.</p><p>5. JAMIE and CERSEI\u2026 I truly want to believe he is going back to Kings Landing to try to fix things with Cersei, and try to convince her of running away together or something. I could see Cersei killing him for being a traitor, for leaving her and accusing him of the loss of their unborn child. She\u2019s paranoid so I think that once she sees herself loosing, she will kill herself by Jamie\u2019s corpse side. Very Romeo and Juliette like.</p><p>6. ARYA\u2026 it was very on point for her to refuse Gendry on those terms of being a lady at a castle. I think she will help the Hound kill the Mountain and finally giving the Hound the gift of mercy. Afterall she\u2019s regained contact with her humanity. I do see her going back to Storm\u2019s End and being with Gendry but as a Master of arms or something on her own terms and him of course supporting her.</p><p>7. BRIENNE AND POD: I can see Brienne as the hand of Sansa and Pod as a Knight. Also, there\u2019s room for Brienne to be having Jaimies twins. Afterall, it was kind of foreshadowed during thr drinking game by bringin up thr fact that she was an only child and a virgin.</p><p>8. Sam: I\u2019m not sure if Sam\u2019s role was just to read about dragon glass killing the white walkers but I\u2019m sure he will write everything that happened on that night and will go back to his family\u2019s castle.</p><p>9. Bran: I\u2019m sure his line to Tyrion about being too much in the past will pay off. There\u2019s still some kind of twist coming for Bran. Probably to open room for the spin off series.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>My bittersweet ending would be: </p><p>Dany\u2019s dream of ending with corruption ends dead along with her. Jon bitter and alive at The Wall, back to his roots. Sansa alone being the lady that conquered it all with her smarts but is still alone and unhappy, nit necesarily a bad leader but hinting shades of the past ruthlessness. Brienne with the things she never thought could achieve (a family, knighthood, etc) but still suffering by the toll it took. And new generations growing up in spring (Sam, Brienne, Arya\u2019s kids)\u2026 maybe Drogon will fly off and lay new eggs but will someone be able to hatch them?

Instead, her mouth is slightly open and the corners\nof her mouth are slightly lowered. There\u2019s a small crease in her brow, there is\na wrinkle in her brow, and, far from frowning, her eyebrows are slightly up. All\nof these are facial expressions for sadness. She looks about to cry.</p><p>And look how she quickly looks\naway, shocked and overcome with emotion. Holding back tears.</p><p><b>And THIS is the most telling element, here: Sansa\u2019s eyes are wet\nand teary.\u00a0</b>She\u2019s holding back tears, but not\ntears of emotion because what Daenerys did was so noble or whatnot (not saying it wasn\u2019t, though). Sansa is\nclearly upset.</p><p><b>But her sadness and shock reveal that her reaction has not been\ncaused by the fact that Daenerys will strip her from her power or by the fact\nthat Daenerys gained a new ally.\u00a0</b>Had\nit been the case, we would have seen the typical Sansa reaction - cold, fierce,\nhead up high, a smirk that says \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing here and I won\u2019t let\nyou win\u201d, a determined gaze, ready to fight, never once looking away as if she\ncouldn\u2019t handle her emotions.

Although Sansa\nseems to be looking at Daenerys,\u00a0<b>Jon\nis in the frame, just next to Sansa</b>.\nIt would have been easy to exclude him from this frame, to do as if he wasn\u2019t\nthere - by having Sansa looking right in front of her, for example, or by\nhaving a close-up to her face. But this is not the case and Jon is included in\nthis frameshot, meaning that whatever is at stake here, and\u00a0<b>whatever it is that causes Sansa\u2019s sadness, has to do with Jon.</b></p><p>But this frame, here, is not about\nrepresenting a love triangle (for once) or to show the tension/rivalry/hatred\nbetween Sansa and Daenerys, because we do not get a shot of all three together\n(not in this scene, anyway) and we do not see a compilation of Sansa and\nDaenerys shots, looking at each other because they\u2019re both playing the game.</p><p>No, this frame is about Sansa\u2019s\nfeelings alone, and Jon is at the center of them.</p><p>Look at this picture.

Or that she is angry because she\nknows Daenerys&rsquo; next step will be to legitimize Jon as Lord Stark, therefore\nstripping Sansa of her title and her power.</p><p>But in my opinion, this is not what\nSansa is thinking right at this moment.</p><p>Look at her face.&nbsp;<b>She\nlooks shocked but also, very remarkably, sad and hurt.&nbsp;</b>She is not angry: her face is not tense or twitched in\nanger, she doesn&rsquo;t frown. Instead, her mouth is slightly open and the corners\nof her mouth are slightly lowered. There&rsquo;s a small crease in her brow, there is\na wrinkle in her brow, and, far from frowning, her eyebrows are slightly up. All\nof these are facial expressions for sadness. She looks about to cry.</p><p>And look how she quickly looks\naway, shocked and overcome with emotion.
