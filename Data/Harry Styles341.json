And if the person you\u2019re trying to reach at that hour is your ex-boyfriend, that idea turns from being fairly bad to absolutely lunatic.\u00a0<br/>And still, in that moment, her upset mind couldn\u2019t offer any other idea than to try and contact him, be it just to wake him up and then end the call, or to talk and confess that she still wanted him.\u00a0</p><p>Their relationship, although calling it that was a bit of a stretch, had broken into pieces a long time ago, and even when it hadn\u2019t been a mutual decision, sober her knew that it had been for the better.\u00a0<br/>Harry was a catch, no doubt, but they hadn\u2019t meshed well. By the end of the months spent fooling around, calling the other boyfriend or girlfriend caused a bitter taste in both of their mouths.\u00a0<br/>But drunk her wanted to have him back regardless. Drunk her needed to be reminded of how his voice sounded when he was woken up form a deep slumber, be it only so it could help her picture the adorable mess on the top of his head.\u00a0<br/>And maybe, she let herself hope, calling him now would get him to come and pick her up. Which in turn would let her see him again, something she so desperately ached for.\u00a0<br/></p><p>And so she lifted her phone and opened her contact list in search for his name, which she hadn\u2019t deleted even after he\u2019d asked her to.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>The shrill sound of his phone ringing didn\u2019t manage to pull Harry from his sleep. His girlfriend pushing weakly against his shoulder and whining next to his ear did.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood god, Har, turn that off,\u201d Y/N murmured and tried to bury her head in her pillow while simultaneously scooting away from him and his side of the bed where the ringing was coming from, something he prevented by keeping both arms locked around her waist.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShh, it\u2019ll go away on its own,\u201d Harry replied and buried his head into her neck, \u201cSleep.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Like a koala, Harry clung onto her and she whined when his leg draped over her thighs. Y/N tried to believe him and squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the awful ringing to come to an end.\u00a0<br/>But it didn\u2019t. The caller was persistent. Y/N thought she was going to cry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry. Please.\u201d<br/></p><p>With a loud groan Harry forced himself to sit and reached for his phone.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Y/N hummed and pulled the covers back up to her chin, \u201cAnne? Gem?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Those were the only two people who she would allow to call him in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said lowly and frowned,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t know the number. Hello?\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned to lay on her side and look at him, at first to ask him to please leave the room and let her sleep, but once she recognized a troubled expression on his face she stopped and instead reached out to rub his wrist softly.\u00a0<br/>Where there had previously been peace evident in his features, was now none of it left as it faded away the moment the person on the other side began to talk.\u00a0<br/>It was a voice Harry recognized all too well. A voice he hadn\u2019t heard in a long while and that with full intention.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me at this hour?\u201d Harry asked and his calm and cold manner easily alarmed Y/N.</p><p>Whoever he was talking to, couldn\u2019t be a person he liked.</p><p>\u201cHarry? Is everything okay?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>He glanced at her briefly and nodded before his hand found hers and she soothingly drew circles over his knuckles.\u00a0<br/>Even when sleep was still trying to pull her under and her eyes were burning the longer she forced them to stay open, Harry\u2019s sudden change in demeanor was enough to keep her up.</p><p>\u201cNo, are you serious?\u201d Harry exclaimed, \u201cI can\u2019t- no, of course not, but- hey, stop messing around that\u2019s not gonna happen!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry glanced at her quickly and squeezed her fingers.\u00a0\u201cListen, I really can\u2019t do- okay. Yes, but I this isn\u2019t- no. No. Of course I don\u2019t want you to- Yeah, fine. I\u2019ll- Okay, yeah, I\u2019ll be there. Text me the address.\u201d</p><p>The minute he set his phone aside, Harry let himself fall back into the pillows. Y/N observed him closely with worry growing in her tummy and once he looked at her, she knew that he had unpleasant news.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Y/N asked again, hand reaching up to caress his cheek softly.<br/></p><p>She noticed a short stumble growing there and she giggled when he turned his head to kiss her palm.<br/>His eyes shone and slowly the smile on her face froze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have something to say that you\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she murmured and Harry sighed at how well she knew him.<br/></p><p>He tried to look away but her gaze was too enchanting. He swallowed hard.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was Lina.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLina?\u201d Y/N thought about it for a moment, trying to figure out why she knew that name, and once it dawned on her, her mouth fell open,\u00a0\u201cOh, no way!\u201d<br/></p><p>Every last ounce of sleep was pulled from her by the sound of that name. Y/N shot up and so did Harry, hands already reaching for her again. She was quick to shrug him off though and pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019m sorry. I-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d she snapped and sat on her knees, facing Harry with a stare that was burning,\u00a0\u201cWhy does she have your number? What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s drunk and at some bar east from-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd what did you mean you\u2019ll be there?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Harry\u2019s shoulders slumped and Y/N was mortified to watch him climb out of bed and reach for the pair of jeans that hung over the chair by his side.\u00a0<br/>With one leg already in the clothing he turned to look at her and tried to smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe needs me to come pick her up.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s hands rubbed her cheeks and she shook her head.\u00a0Her Harry was leaving their bed to go to a woman he\u2019d slept with on multiple occasions who also was drunk. And who she knew was still obsessed with him. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said sincerely and pouted, hoping to ease her, though that he was fastening his belt around his slim hips and searching for his shoes, didn\u2019t make anything better, \u201cBut what else am I gonna do?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Y/N sighed and let her body fall back onto the soft mattress.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Her gaze was set on the ceiling and Harry\u2019s tummy fluttered at the sight of her scowling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry pulled the jumper she\u2019d worn the day before over his head before crawling back onto the bed so he could reach for her. For a moment he worried she might fight him off, but then she let him move closer and he relaxed. His hands gently rubbed her thighs, trying to get her to give him her attention again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, please. Don\u2019t want you to be mad at me.\u201d<br/></p><p>He squeezed her knees and smiled when she finally met his eyes again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you, Har,\u201d she finally muttered unwillingly,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s her who I would want to strangle right now. How dare she?\u201d</p><p>His phone made a brief sound, indicating a text message and he could practically see the blood boil in her veins.\u00a0<br/>Though he felt wrong about it, he couldn\u2019t go without knowing that Y/N was alright and that he wasn\u2019t disappointing her. She was his girlfriend now. His priority. Not Lina.</p><p>\u201cIf you really want me to stay then m\u2019not leaving. Someone else can go pick her up and-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d Y/N reached for his hands and pulled them up so he was touching her cheeks, \u201cYou have to go and be there for her. You already promised and&hellip; well, you\u2019re the only dork who doesn\u2019t turn the sounds off on their phone during the night so I don\u2019t think she could find somebody who would go and get her.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Harry crawled further to her and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay that I\u2019ll head out for a moment?\u201d<br/></p><p>She scowled. But nodded.\u00a0\u201cYeah. You\u2019re a good guy. This makes you a really, really, wondefull guy.\u201d</p><p>Harry kissed her mouth. His forehead brushed hers and she closed her eyes before reopening them to meet his warm ones.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me no,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t though. Go. It\u2019s alright. But don\u2019t you bring her here, okay? She can at least sleep it off at her own place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my love,\u201d he replied and hushed another peck to her mouth before raising to move off the bed,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, promise.\u201d</p><p><b>hope you enjoyed this one. thank you for reading! also I wrote and uploaded this in a starbucks and their internet is slow so I hope it works!</b></p><p><a href=\"http://harryimaginedstories.tumblr.com/post/144920695218/masterlist\">Masterlist</a><br/></p>",

Is everything okay?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>He glanced at her briefly and nodded before his hand found hers and she soothingly drew circles over his knuckles.\u00a0<br>Even when sleep was still trying to pull her under and her eyes were burning the longer she forced them to stay open, Harry\u2019s sudden change in demeanor was enough to keep her up.</p><p>\u201cNo, are you serious?\u201d Harry exclaimed, \u201cI can\u2019t- no, of course not, but- hey, stop messing around that\u2019s not gonna happen!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d<br></p><p>Harry glanced at her quickly and squeezed her fingers.\u00a0\u201cListen, I really can\u2019t do- okay. Yes, but I this isn\u2019t- no. No. Of course I don\u2019t want you to- Yeah, fine. I\u2019ll- Okay, yeah, I\u2019ll be there. Text me the address.\u201d</p><p>The minute he set his phone aside, Harry let himself fall back into the pillows. Y/N observed him closely with worry growing in her tummy and once he looked at her, she knew that he had unpleasant news.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Y/N asked again, hand reaching up to caress his cheek softly.<br></p><p>She noticed a short stumble growing there and she giggled when he turned his head to kiss her palm.<br>His eyes shone and slowly the smile on her face froze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have something to say that you\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she murmured and Harry sighed at how well she knew him.<br></p><p>He tried to look away but her gaze was too enchanting. He swallowed hard.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was Lina.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLina?\u201d Y/N thought about it for a moment, trying to figure out why she knew that name, and once it dawned on her, her mouth fell open,\u00a0\u201cOh, no way!\u201d<br></p><p>Every last ounce of sleep was pulled from her by the sound of that name. Y/N shot up and so did Harry, hands already reaching for her again. She was quick to shrug him off though and pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019m sorry. I-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d she snapped and sat on her knees, facing Harry with a stare that was burning,\u00a0\u201cWhy does she have your number? What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s drunk and at some bar east from-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd what did you mean you\u2019ll be there?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry\u2019s shoulders slumped and Y/N was mortified to watch him climb out of bed and reach for the pair of jeans that hung over the chair by his side.\u00a0<br>With one leg already in the clothing he turned to look at her and tried to smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe needs me to come pick her up.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s hands rubbed her cheeks and she shook her head.\u00a0Her Harry was leaving their bed to go to a woman he\u2019d slept with on multiple occasions who also was drunk. And who she knew was still obsessed with him. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said sincerely and pouted, hoping to ease her, though that he was fastening his belt around his slim hips and searching for his shoes, didn\u2019t make anything better, \u201cBut what else am I gonna do?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Y/N sighed and let her body fall back onto the soft mattress.\u00a0<br></p><p>Her gaze was set on the ceiling and Harry\u2019s tummy fluttered at the sight of her scowling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry pulled the jumper she\u2019d worn the day before over his head before crawling back onto the bed so he could reach for her. For a moment he worried she might fight him off, but then she let him move closer and he relaxed. His hands gently rubbed her thighs, trying to get her to give him her attention again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, please. Don\u2019t want you to be mad at me.\u201d<br></p><p>He squeezed her knees and smiled when she finally met his eyes again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you, Har,\u201d she finally muttered unwillingly,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s her who I would want to strangle right now. How dare she?\u201d</p><p>His phone made a brief sound, indicating a text message and he could practically see the blood boil in her veins.\u00a0<br>Though he felt wrong about it, he couldn\u2019t go without knowing that Y/N was alright and that he wasn\u2019t disappointing her. She was his girlfriend now. His priority. Not Lina.</p><p>\u201cIf you really want me to stay then m\u2019not leaving. Someone else can go pick her up and-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d Y/N reached for his hands and pulled them up so he was touching her cheeks, \u201cYou have to go and be there for her. You already promised and\u2026 well, you\u2019re the only dork who doesn\u2019t turn the sounds off on their phone during the night so I don\u2019t think she could find somebody who would go and get her.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Harry crawled further to her and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay that I\u2019ll head out for a moment?\u201d<br></p><p>She scowled. But nodded.\u00a0\u201cYeah. You\u2019re a good guy. This makes you a really, really, wondefull guy.\u201d</p><p>Harry kissed her mouth. His forehead brushed hers and she closed her eyes before reopening them to meet his warm ones.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me no,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t though. Go. It\u2019s alright. But don\u2019t you bring her here, okay? She can at least sleep it off at her own place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my love,\u201d he replied and hushed another peck to her mouth before raising to move off the bed,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, promise.\u201d</p><p><b>hope you enjoyed this one. thank you for reading! also I wrote and uploaded this in a starbucks and their internet is slow so I hope it works!</b></p><p><a href=\"http://harryimaginedstories.tumblr.com/post/144920695218/masterlist\">Masterlist</a><br></p>",

And if the person you\u2019re trying to reach at that hour is your ex-boyfriend, that idea turns from being fairly bad to absolutely lunatic.\u00a0<br>And still, in that moment, her upset mind couldn\u2019t offer any other idea than to try and contact him, be it just to wake him up and then end the call, or to talk and confess that she still wanted him.\u00a0</p><p>Their relationship, although calling it that was a bit of a stretch, had broken into pieces a long time ago, and even when it hadn\u2019t been a mutual decision, sober her knew that it had been for the better.\u00a0<br>Harry was a catch, no doubt, but they hadn\u2019t meshed well. By the end of the months spent fooling around, calling the other boyfriend or girlfriend caused a bitter taste in both of their mouths.\u00a0<br>But drunk her wanted to have him back regardless. Drunk her needed to be reminded of how his voice sounded when he was woken up form a deep slumber, be it only so it could help her picture the adorable mess on the top of his head.\u00a0<br>And maybe, she let herself hope, calling him now would get him to come and pick her up. Which in turn would let her see him again, something she so desperately ached for.\u00a0<br></p><p>And so she lifted her phone and opened her contact list in search for his name, which she hadn\u2019t deleted even after he\u2019d asked her to.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>The shrill sound of his phone ringing didn\u2019t manage to pull Harry from his sleep.

Is everything okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He glanced at her briefly and nodded before his hand found hers and she soothingly drew circles over his knuckles.&nbsp;<br />Even when sleep was still trying to pull her under and her eyes were burning the longer she forced them to stay open, Harry&rsquo;s sudden change in demeanor was enough to keep her up.</p><p>&ldquo;No, are you serious?&rdquo; Harry exclaimed, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t- no, of course not, but- hey, stop messing around that&rsquo;s not gonna happen!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry glanced at her quickly and squeezed her fingers.&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen, I really can&rsquo;t do- okay. Yes, but I this isn&rsquo;t- no. No. Of course I don&rsquo;t want you to- Yeah, fine. I&rsquo;ll- Okay, yeah, I&rsquo;ll be there. Text me the address.&rdquo;</p><p>The minute he set his phone aside, Harry let himself fall back into the pillows. Y/N observed him closely with worry growing in her tummy and once he looked at her, she knew that he had unpleasant news.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; Y/N asked again, hand reaching up to caress his cheek softly.<br /></p><p>She noticed a short stumble growing there and she giggled when he turned his head to kiss her palm.<br />His eyes shone and slowly the smile on her face froze.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You have something to say that you&rsquo;d rather I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she murmured and Harry sighed at how well she knew him.<br /></p><p>He tried to look away but her gaze was too enchanting. He swallowed hard.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was Lina.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lina?&rdquo; Y/N thought about it for a moment, trying to figure out why she knew that name, and once it dawned on her, her mouth fell open,&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, no way!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Every last ounce of sleep was pulled from her by the sound of that name. Y/N shot up and so did Harry, hands already reaching for her again. She was quick to shrug him off though and pushed him away.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m sorry. I-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What did she want?&rdquo; she snapped and sat on her knees, facing Harry with a stare that was burning,&nbsp;&ldquo;Why does she have your number? What did she say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s drunk and at some bar east from-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And what did you mean you&rsquo;ll be there?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s shoulders slumped and Y/N was mortified to watch him climb out of bed and reach for the pair of jeans that hung over the chair by his side.&nbsp;<br />With one leg already in the clothing he turned to look at her and tried to smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She needs me to come pick her up.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s hands rubbed her cheeks and she shook her head.&nbsp;Her Harry was leaving their bed to go to a woman he&rsquo;d slept with on multiple occasions who also was drunk. And who she knew was still obsessed with him. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what to say.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said sincerely and pouted, hoping to ease her, though that he was fastening his belt around his slim hips and searching for his shoes, didn&rsquo;t make anything better, &ldquo;But what else am I gonna do?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s unbelievable.&rdquo; Y/N sighed and let her body fall back onto the soft mattress.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Her gaze was set on the ceiling and Harry&rsquo;s tummy fluttered at the sight of her scowling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry pulled the jumper she&rsquo;d worn the day before over his head before crawling back onto the bed so he could reach for her. For a moment he worried she might fight him off, but then she let him move closer and he relaxed. His hands gently rubbed her thighs, trying to get her to give him her attention again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, please. Don&rsquo;t want you to be mad at me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He squeezed her knees and smiled when she finally met his eyes again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad at you, Har,&rdquo; she finally muttered unwillingly,&nbsp;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s her who I would want to strangle right now. How dare she?&rdquo;</p><p>His phone made a brief sound, indicating a text message and he could practically see the blood boil in her veins.&nbsp;<br />Though he felt wrong about it, he couldn&rsquo;t go without knowing that Y/N was alright and that he wasn&rsquo;t disappointing her. She was his girlfriend now. His priority. Not Lina.</p><p>&ldquo;If you really want me to stay then m&rsquo;not leaving. Someone else can go pick her up and-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no,&rdquo; Y/N reached for his hands and pulled them up so he was touching her cheeks, &ldquo;You have to go and be there for her. You already promised and&hellip; well, you&rsquo;re the only dork who doesn&rsquo;t turn the sounds off on their phone during the night so I don&rsquo;t think she could find somebody who would go and get her.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Harry crawled further to her and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay that I&rsquo;ll head out for a moment?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She scowled. But nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah. You&rsquo;re a good guy. This makes you a really, really, wondefull guy.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry kissed her mouth. His forehead brushed hers and she closed her eyes before reopening them to meet his warm ones.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You can tell me no,&rdquo; he murmured.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t though. Go. It&rsquo;s alright. But don&rsquo;t you bring her here, okay? She can at least sleep it off at her own place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, my love,&rdquo; he replied and hushed another peck to her mouth before raising to move off the bed,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back soon, promise.&rdquo;</p><p><b>hope you enjoyed this one. thank you for reading! also I wrote and uploaded this in a starbucks and their internet is slow so I hope it works!</b></p><p><a href=\"http://harryimaginedstories.tumblr.com/post/144920695218/masterlist\">Masterlist</a><br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>this is another thought I had and wrote down. hope you enjoy. it&rsquo;s fairly short and a familiar prompt with a twist on it.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/115dc1537fd2c11833a06765363d9233/tumblr_inline_pabryd3TMf1u8dhpq_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Calling a person in the middle of the night whilst being under the influence of a lot of alcohol, is never a good idea. And if the person you&rsquo;re trying to reach at that hour is your ex-boyfriend, that idea turns from being fairly bad to absolutely lunatic.&nbsp;<br />And still, in that moment, her upset mind couldn&rsquo;t offer any other idea than to try and contact him, be it just to wake him up and then end the call, or to talk and confess that she still wanted him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their relationship, although calling it that was a bit of a stretch, had broken into pieces a long time ago, and even when it hadn&rsquo;t been a mutual decision, sober her knew that it had been for the better.&nbsp;<br />Harry was a catch, no doubt, but they hadn&rsquo;t meshed well. By the end of the months spent fooling around, calling the other boyfriend or girlfriend caused a bitter taste in both of their mouths.&nbsp;<br />But drunk her wanted to have him back regardless. Drunk her needed to be reminded of how his voice sounded when he was woken up form a deep slumber, be it only so it could help her picture the adorable mess on the top of his head.&nbsp;<br />And maybe, she let herself hope, calling him now would get him to come and pick her up. Which in turn would let her see him again, something she so desperately ached for.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>And so she lifted her phone and opened her contact list in search for his name, which she hadn&rsquo;t deleted even after he&rsquo;d asked her to.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
