She pressured him to have sex with him, if he didn&rsquo;t want her to tell the other ff he was still a member of the NW ; reverse the genders - a man pressuring a woman to have sex with him threatening her to do something against her if she refuses - and well suddenly that&rsquo;s really creepy&hellip; As for her who keeps telling hi. he knows nothing, mocking him for being a bit romantic, threatening him to cut his balls if he betrayed her (she also shot him with an arrow)&hellip; Well, isn&rsquo;t it a bit similar to Joffrey and Sansa ? Joffrey kept calling Sansa stupid, and threatening to physically harm her (and sometimes to kill her). And yes, even if Jon was obviously really fond of Ygritte, he was quickly turned off when she would remind him that she was after all an invader threatening Westeros safety. So yes, if she had survived, they still would have parted at some point.</p>",

The weather woman on your tv went on about how warm it would be today, and she was also excited for the Battle of the Bands.</p><!-- more --><p>For once the weather woman was right. You stuck your hand out a window letting it catch the sun\u2019s warmth. It was going to be a lovely day. You slipped on shorts, a cut-up band t-shirt, and sneakers. It would suffice for spending all day at a music festival.</p><p>You almost took your car keys when you remembered that you had a city bus pass. What better way to start your article than to see other people get excited for the event itself? You left your car keys at home, and headed straight for the bus stop. Families with kids in AC/DC t-shirts and girls with flower crowns made you smile. The bus was filled with people all going to the city festival. You turned to see a young boy adjusting his baseball cap. You looked towards his parents who were occupied with his little sister, but you caught the mother\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cHi! Sorry to bother you,\u201d you glanced back at her son. \u201cI\u2019m a writer for The Scene. I was wondering if I could ask your son some questions about Battle of the Bands?\u201d</p><p>The mother smiled and nodded. \u201cOf course! Dominic, she would like to ask you some questions.\u201d The mother put her son in front of you. Dominic sat down in a bus seat, and you kneeled in front of him, balancing on your feet as the bus moved forward.</p><p>\u201cHi Dominic, are you excited for today?\u201d you asked the child. He nodded, keeping his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cTell her who we\u2019re going to see,\u201d the mother nudged him. The little boy smiled and shied away from you.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, you can tell me,\u201d you said, smiling. Dominic looked down, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cBlackfyre,\u201d he said, in an almost whisper. \u201cI like them a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father is a fan of theirs. He played Blackfyre in front of Dominic so much that Dominic started to love them,\u201d she told you. You wrote down quick notes for yourself. The mother went on. \u201cI even caught him shredding the guitar to one of their songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really? Do you wanna be a rockstar when you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Dominic shouted with excitement. His hands raised up in the air as if he was on a roller coaster. You stood up from your spot as the bus slowed down.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. I got what I need,\u201d you nodded to the mother once more before you hopped off the bus. You put away your notebook and continued down the downtown street. First, Margie. Then Battle. This was going to be a busy first day.</p><p>Margaery finished off her second mimosa of the day and knocked on the bar. \u201cAnother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut you off if you don\u2019t slow down!\u201d Loras immediately called out to her. Margie rolled her eyes and put her focus back on you.</p><p>\u201cBlackfyre huh?\u201d she recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s Viserys Targaryen\u2019s band. He\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Think he may win the battle?\u201d you scooped up a breakfast taco filled with eggs and sausage. <br/>\u201cHe actually might,\u201d Margie nodded seriously. \u201cHis band reminds a lot of the adults of their classic rock days, but he has a reach on their younger teens. He\u2019s a good looking guy with a lot of talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on him,\u201d you said, taking another bite. \u201cWhat the fuck is in these tacos? They\u2019re like crack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Margie said, eyes wide on her own breakfast. She looked towards her brother and then back to you. \u201cDo you want to do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of favor?\u201d you asked, knowing fully well this meant trouble for you.</p><p>Margie shot a look towards her brother. \u201cIt\u2019s about Renly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want me to spy on him? Like we used to do on the internet?\u201d you chuckled. Margie almost spat out her drink. Remembering your long distance internet days brought back joyful memories of you searching and stalking Margie\u2019s love interests. You dug so hard into one of their social media profile\u2019s that you found their SAT score. Margie was so impressed that she almost hired you to do more private investigative work.</p><p>\u201cYes, but no,\u201d Margie beckoned for you to come closer, obviously not wanting her brother to hear. \u201cLoras really needs this. He\u2019s been lonely and depressed. Maybe encourage Renly to hang with Loras sometime? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to push him into a relationship, but he needs something. Someone. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see Renly today. Along with Robb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cute boss?\u201d Margie gushed. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna flirt with him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he has a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d Margie winked. \u201cFlirt with him and then tell me about it.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t matter what you argued with Margaery, you wanted to flirt with him anyways. Once you stepped into the festival, you were grateful for your heat-friendly outfit.</p><p>The festival had several booths up front. Some where you could play games to win small prizes, others were advertising their local businesses. You recognized a young man standing in line at a booth to the side. You squinted to see his slender form, sunglasses, and his hands in his pockets while talking to another person beside him.</p><p>\u201cRenly? Renly Baratheon?\u201d you called out. The young man turned around to see you. He smiled and beckoned for you to come over.</p><p>\u201cHi! I\u2019ve seen you in the office. Heard you got my assignment, yeah?\u201d Renly smiled. He extended his hand out for you to shake. You gladly took it.</p><p>\u201cI did, yes.\u201d You looked beside Renly and recognized his conversation partner. \u201cHi, Robb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! You made it. Welcome to Battle of the Bands,\u201d Robb looked ahead of the line. \u201cI was trying to get everyone\u2019s press badges, but it seems they\u2019re really short staffed this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d you commented seeing the long line ahead of you. \u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d</p><p>Robb frowned and scratched the back of his neck. He shared one look with Renly and turned to you. \u201cThere was an incident last year. Someone on staff was harassed and it made news. People have been hesitant to join festival staff and press after that. I\u2019m honestly lucky to have you here.\u201d</p><p>Robb gave you a grateful smile and you returned it right back to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you gave me this opportunity,\u201d you returned the compliment. The line moved forward much more, but you continued the conversation. \u201cSo, I hear you\u2019re playing in the Battle this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Renly started off. \u201cStag Knight is ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStag Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA play off my family\u2019s tradition and name.\u201d Renly wore a confident smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s a nod to my ancestors who were excellent hunters, but I don\u2019t believe in hurting animals myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vegetarian?\u201d you smiled, thinking ahead two steps. Renly nodded, patting his sack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got loads of my snacks in here today. If you need any water, come stop by, we\u2019ll have lots,\u201d Renly said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know I\u2019m new to the city, but there\u2019s this great taco place that serves amazing vegetarian friendly tacos\u2014</p><p>\u201cSunspot!\u201d Renly cut you off. \u201cI love that place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to know one of the bartenders there,\u201d you added. \u201cLoras is so much fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoras?\u201d Renly thought. \u201cThe cute guy with curls? He always seemed so shy to me.\u201d You held in your excitement at his comment and continued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really not. He\u2019s so much fun. We should all hang out sometime!\u201d There it was, your move. Renly nodded and turned to Robb.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun! We should.\u201d Bingo. Margie had always commended you on how you played your social chess. Sometimes, she would claim you were better than her. You weren\u2019t sure of that, but you knew you were going to get credit for this somehow.</p><p>Once you got your press badge, Renly parted ways with you and Robb. He trotted off quickly to rehearse before going on stage later that day. Robb put his badge over his head and looked at the schedule.</p><p>\u201cSo, who do we go to first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you pulled out your notes. \u201cI interviewed a little boy on the bus who was excited to see Blackfyre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Viserys,\u201d Robb chuckled. \u201cArrogant cock.\u201d You took a step back.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026not terribly nice,\u201d Robb walked with you through the festival. You heard alternative rock from one side of you. A crowd of people held their phones up to record. \u201cHe\u2019s had a taste of success already. He\u2019s talented, but it\u2019s gone to his head. Maybe it\u2019s best to stay away from him for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh okay,\u201d you looked down, feeling dejected. Robb patted your back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to follow this lead or that I don\u2019t trust you,\u201d Robb smiled. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to go interview him and come back in tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that bad?\u201d you responded.</p><p>Robb shrugged. \u201cSome say he is, some say differently. I just want to be cautious. I don\u2019t want to lose a good writer on the first day.\u201d You smiled, feeling the warmth of the compliment.</p><p>Robb pointed to a pub on the corner of the street, a bit away from the festival. Both of you crossed the street and entered inside the Irish-themed pub. Inside, there was no leprechauns or four-leaf clovers. Instead, there was old pictures of Ireland, showcasing ancestors and family trees. The Ireland flag hung proudly. You feel the cool air of the air conditioning, and you silently thanked Robb for saving you from the heat.</p><p>People spoke silently while they drank their pints. Other listened intently to the musician on the small stage. A guitar played a slow beat beautifully. Your eyes wandered to the artist. He wore boots and jeans. His flannel shirt was open to reveal his white tank underneath. It fit him tight. A shadow of a beard looked good on his face. His curls were much darker than Robb\u2019s. Then the idea clicked.</p><p>\u201cThis is my half-brother, Jon,\u201d Robb whispered. \u201cI thought he would be a great first interview for you. And vice versa.\u201d You inched forward and found a seat near the stage. Jon\u2019s voice was a low and slow harmony. You listened intently to the lyrics.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m a cowboy on a steel horse I ride<br/>I\u2019m wanted, dead or alive.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cBon Jovi,\u201d you smiled, nodding along. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him like this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon\u2019s good for that,\u201d Robb smiled proudly. \u201cHe has the talent I wish I had. He doesn\u2019t do big audiences. He likes it small like this.\u201d Jon kept singing. His voice belted out the last few lyrics. Once he finished, the crowd in the pub applauded loudly for him. A few stood up and gave him whoops of joy. Jon smiled and nodded \u2018thank yous\u2019 to where he could until his eyes fell to you.</p><p>You watched his heart skip a beat, and you couldn\u2019t hide your own blush rushing to your cheeks. Jon was adorable, and you hadn\u2019t spoken a single word to him yet. You wanted to slap yourself in the face. If Robb was attractive, of course his brother would be just as attractive. Duh. Jon walked down from the stage and walked towards your table with Robb.</p><p>\u201cGood job!\u201d Robb embraced Jon. He patted him on the back and then turned to you. \u201cThis is Y/N. She\u2019s taking over for Renly this year.\u201d Jon sheepishly smiled at you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab some drinks, yeah?\u201d Robb offered. \u201cPints?\u201d When both of you nodded, Robb took off to the bar while you and Jon sat down.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to interview me?\u201d Jon said. He bit his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t ask hard questions,\u201d you wanted to reach out to his hand and touch him to reassure him. He seemed so scared of you. \u201cRobb told me how talented you are, and I agree with him. Why aren\u2019t you playing out there with the rest of the bands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like big crowds.\u201d Jon took another look outside. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hot out there.\u201d You laughed once at his joke and quickly wrote it down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny, but you sing really serious music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer classic rock,\u201d Jon told you. \u201cI write my own music and preform that sometimes, but I want to be taken seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou write your own music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jon\u2019s hand massaged the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t perform it that much. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you up there. I think you\u2019re great!\u201d You smiled at him. Jon seemed to be a gentle soul. You watched his smile grow on his face. A pint was placed in front of you. Robb sat down between you both.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Robb asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Jon spoke before you. \u201cShe\u2019s really nice.\u201d You sighed and looked at Robb.<br/>\u201cYou told him about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Robb shrugged. \u201cI told him that a pretty nice girl was going to interview him today and he agreed to it.\u201d Jon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, you said that a very pretty and a very nice girl was going to interview me,\u201d Jon corrected. Your eyes immediately watched Robb for his reaction. His eyes narrowed at his brother, but then softened towards you.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d you smugly smiled. Robb cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cJust interview him and you,\u201d Robb pointed at Jon. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d Without as much as a goodbye, Robb left the pub, leaving you and Jon alone.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m pretty?\u201d you asked Jon. Both of you started to laugh. Jon stopped laughing first and looked at you.</p><p>\u201cHe was right though. You are pretty. And nice. You are very nice,\u201d Jon almost stumbled over his words. You couldn\u2019t help but smile at him. The interview continued. You asked Jon more questions about him, his music, and who he would like to see win.</p><p>\u201cRenly and Stag Knight,\u201d Jon answered.</p><p>\u201cNot yourself?\u201d you asked, keeping the back of the pen near your mouth. Jon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think Renly and his friends deserve it more. I just like doing music. I don\u2019t need to win anything.\u201d You felt your heart swell. Jon was so selfless that you wanted him to do nothing but hand puppies to other people. Because of course that\u2019s a career that selfless people should do. Hand puppies to people and make them happy.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jon.\u201d You closed your notebook. \u201cI got everything I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jon watched you stand up from your spot and began speaking again. \u201cRobb told me you\u2019re new to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, yeah,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna stick around? Maybe have another pint? Couldn\u2019t hurt to make more friends?\u201d Jon\u2019s fingers played with the pint glass in his hand. His smile was more genuine than any smile you\u2019d ever seen. You glanced at your phone and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI really wish I could, but I am on assignment. I need to write up this interview for the website,\u201d you frowned at him. You wish you could spend more time with Jon. After interviewing him, you realized how much he loved music and only wanted to play it for people to listen, not to be popular.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I understand. Working for my brother can be hard sometimes,\u201d Jon led you to the door. \u201cJust let me know if he\u2019s a hardass on you, ok?\u201d</p><p>You nodded. Before you could officially say goodbye to him, Jon unlocked his parked car on the curb.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna give me a ride?\u201d you asked. \u201cYou just met me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jon continued. \u201cMy mother, well, Cat\u2019s not really my mom, but she taught me to be polite always. Now, you could walk back to your office, or you can jump in here, avoid the heat, and get to your office faster.\u201d The choice was obvious. You jumped in Jon\u2019s car and he drove you a mere ten minutes back to the headquarters.</p><p>Once you sat at your desk and had your notes open, you realized you never left your number with Jon. He had been so kind to you and so genuine. You groaned loudly as your hands melted into your face.

The weather woman on your tv went on about how warm it would be today, and she was also excited for the Battle of the Bands.</p>[[MORE]]<p>For once the weather woman was right. You stuck your hand out a window letting it catch the sun\u2019s warmth. It was going to be a lovely day. You slipped on shorts, a cut-up band t-shirt, and sneakers. It would suffice for spending all day at a music festival.</p><p>You almost took your car keys when you remembered that you had a city bus pass. What better way to start your article than to see other people get excited for the event itself? You left your car keys at home, and headed straight for the bus stop. Families with kids in AC/DC t-shirts and girls with flower crowns made you smile. The bus was filled with people all going to the city festival. You turned to see a young boy adjusting his baseball cap. You looked towards his parents who were occupied with his little sister, but you caught the mother\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cHi! Sorry to bother you,\u201d you glanced back at her son. \u201cI\u2019m a writer for The Scene. I was wondering if I could ask your son some questions about Battle of the Bands?\u201d</p><p>The mother smiled and nodded. \u201cOf course! Dominic, she would like to ask you some questions.\u201d The mother put her son in front of you. Dominic sat down in a bus seat, and you kneeled in front of him, balancing on your feet as the bus moved forward.</p><p>\u201cHi Dominic, are you excited for today?\u201d you asked the child. He nodded, keeping his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cTell her who we\u2019re going to see,\u201d the mother nudged him. The little boy smiled and shied away from you.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, you can tell me,\u201d you said, smiling. Dominic looked down, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cBlackfyre,\u201d he said, in an almost whisper. \u201cI like them a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father is a fan of theirs. He played Blackfyre in front of Dominic so much that Dominic started to love them,\u201d she told you. You wrote down quick notes for yourself. The mother went on. \u201cI even caught him shredding the guitar to one of their songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really? Do you wanna be a rockstar when you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Dominic shouted with excitement. His hands raised up in the air as if he was on a roller coaster. You stood up from your spot as the bus slowed down.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. I got what I need,\u201d you nodded to the mother once more before you hopped off the bus. You put away your notebook and continued down the downtown street. First, Margie. Then Battle. This was going to be a busy first day.</p><p>Margaery finished off her second mimosa of the day and knocked on the bar. \u201cAnother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut you off if you don\u2019t slow down!\u201d Loras immediately called out to her. Margie rolled her eyes and put her focus back on you.</p><p>\u201cBlackfyre huh?\u201d she recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s Viserys Targaryen\u2019s band. He\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Think he may win the battle?\u201d you scooped up a breakfast taco filled with eggs and sausage. <br>\u201cHe actually might,\u201d Margie nodded seriously. \u201cHis band reminds a lot of the adults of their classic rock days, but he has a reach on their younger teens. He\u2019s a good looking guy with a lot of talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on him,\u201d you said, taking another bite. \u201cWhat the fuck is in these tacos? They\u2019re like crack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Margie said, eyes wide on her own breakfast. She looked towards her brother and then back to you. \u201cDo you want to do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of favor?\u201d you asked, knowing fully well this meant trouble for you.</p><p>Margie shot a look towards her brother. \u201cIt\u2019s about Renly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want me to spy on him? Like we used to do on the internet?\u201d you chuckled. Margie almost spat out her drink. Remembering your long distance internet days brought back joyful memories of you searching and stalking Margie\u2019s love interests. You dug so hard into one of their social media profile\u2019s that you found their SAT score. Margie was so impressed that she almost hired you to do more private investigative work.</p><p>\u201cYes, but no,\u201d Margie beckoned for you to come closer, obviously not wanting her brother to hear. \u201cLoras really needs this. He\u2019s been lonely and depressed. Maybe encourage Renly to hang with Loras sometime? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to push him into a relationship, but he needs something. Someone. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see Renly today. Along with Robb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cute boss?\u201d Margie gushed. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna flirt with him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he has a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d Margie winked. \u201cFlirt with him and then tell me about it.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t matter what you argued with Margaery, you wanted to flirt with him anyways. Once you stepped into the festival, you were grateful for your heat-friendly outfit.</p><p>The festival had several booths up front. Some where you could play games to win small prizes, others were advertising their local businesses. You recognized a young man standing in line at a booth to the side. You squinted to see his slender form, sunglasses, and his hands in his pockets while talking to another person beside him.</p><p>\u201cRenly? Renly Baratheon?\u201d you called out. The young man turned around to see you. He smiled and beckoned for you to come over.</p><p>\u201cHi! I\u2019ve seen you in the office. Heard you got my assignment, yeah?\u201d Renly smiled. He extended his hand out for you to shake. You gladly took it.</p><p>\u201cI did, yes.\u201d You looked beside Renly and recognized his conversation partner. \u201cHi, Robb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! You made it. Welcome to Battle of the Bands,\u201d Robb looked ahead of the line. \u201cI was trying to get everyone\u2019s press badges, but it seems they\u2019re really short staffed this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d you commented seeing the long line ahead of you. \u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d</p><p>Robb frowned and scratched the back of his neck. He shared one look with Renly and turned to you. \u201cThere was an incident last year. Someone on staff was harassed and it made news. People have been hesitant to join festival staff and press after that. I\u2019m honestly lucky to have you here.\u201d</p><p>Robb gave you a grateful smile and you returned it right back to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you gave me this opportunity,\u201d you returned the compliment. The line moved forward much more, but you continued the conversation. \u201cSo, I hear you\u2019re playing in the Battle this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Renly started off. \u201cStag Knight is ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStag Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA play off my family\u2019s tradition and name.\u201d Renly wore a confident smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s a nod to my ancestors who were excellent hunters, but I don\u2019t believe in hurting animals myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vegetarian?\u201d you smiled, thinking ahead two steps. Renly nodded, patting his sack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got loads of my snacks in here today. If you need any water, come stop by, we\u2019ll have lots,\u201d Renly said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know I\u2019m new to the city, but there\u2019s this great taco place that serves amazing vegetarian friendly tacos\u2014</p><p>\u201cSunspot!\u201d Renly cut you off. \u201cI love that place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to know one of the bartenders there,\u201d you added. \u201cLoras is so much fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoras?\u201d Renly thought. \u201cThe cute guy with curls? He always seemed so shy to me.\u201d You held in your excitement at his comment and continued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really not. He\u2019s so much fun. We should all hang out sometime!\u201d There it was, your move. Renly nodded and turned to Robb.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun! We should.\u201d Bingo. Margie had always commended you on how you played your social chess. Sometimes, she would claim you were better than her. You weren\u2019t sure of that, but you knew you were going to get credit for this somehow.</p><p>Once you got your press badge, Renly parted ways with you and Robb. He trotted off quickly to rehearse before going on stage later that day. Robb put his badge over his head and looked at the schedule.</p><p>\u201cSo, who do we go to first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you pulled out your notes. \u201cI interviewed a little boy on the bus who was excited to see Blackfyre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Viserys,\u201d Robb chuckled. \u201cArrogant cock.\u201d You took a step back.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026not terribly nice,\u201d Robb walked with you through the festival. You heard alternative rock from one side of you. A crowd of people held their phones up to record. \u201cHe\u2019s had a taste of success already. He\u2019s talented, but it\u2019s gone to his head. Maybe it\u2019s best to stay away from him for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh okay,\u201d you looked down, feeling dejected. Robb patted your back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to follow this lead or that I don\u2019t trust you,\u201d Robb smiled. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to go interview him and come back in tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that bad?\u201d you responded.</p><p>Robb shrugged. \u201cSome say he is, some say differently. I just want to be cautious. I don\u2019t want to lose a good writer on the first day.\u201d You smiled, feeling the warmth of the compliment.</p><p>Robb pointed to a pub on the corner of the street, a bit away from the festival. Both of you crossed the street and entered inside the Irish-themed pub. Inside, there was no leprechauns or four-leaf clovers. Instead, there was old pictures of Ireland, showcasing ancestors and family trees. The Ireland flag hung proudly. You feel the cool air of the air conditioning, and you silently thanked Robb for saving you from the heat.</p><p>People spoke silently while they drank their pints. Other listened intently to the musician on the small stage. A guitar played a slow beat beautifully. Your eyes wandered to the artist. He wore boots and jeans. His flannel shirt was open to reveal his white tank underneath. It fit him tight. A shadow of a beard looked good on his face. His curls were much darker than Robb\u2019s. Then the idea clicked.</p><p>\u201cThis is my half-brother, Jon,\u201d Robb whispered. \u201cI thought he would be a great first interview for you. And vice versa.\u201d You inched forward and found a seat near the stage. Jon\u2019s voice was a low and slow harmony. You listened intently to the lyrics.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m a cowboy on a steel horse I ride<br>I\u2019m wanted, dead or alive.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cBon Jovi,\u201d you smiled, nodding along. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him like this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon\u2019s good for that,\u201d Robb smiled proudly. \u201cHe has the talent I wish I had. He doesn\u2019t do big audiences. He likes it small like this.\u201d Jon kept singing. His voice belted out the last few lyrics. Once he finished, the crowd in the pub applauded loudly for him. A few stood up and gave him whoops of joy. Jon smiled and nodded \u2018thank yous\u2019 to where he could until his eyes fell to you.</p><p>You watched his heart skip a beat, and you couldn\u2019t hide your own blush rushing to your cheeks. Jon was adorable, and you hadn\u2019t spoken a single word to him yet. You wanted to slap yourself in the face. If Robb was attractive, of course his brother would be just as attractive. Duh. Jon walked down from the stage and walked towards your table with Robb.</p><p>\u201cGood job!\u201d Robb embraced Jon. He patted him on the back and then turned to you. \u201cThis is Y/N. She\u2019s taking over for Renly this year.\u201d Jon sheepishly smiled at you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab some drinks, yeah?\u201d Robb offered. \u201cPints?\u201d When both of you nodded, Robb took off to the bar while you and Jon sat down.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to interview me?\u201d Jon said. He bit his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t ask hard questions,\u201d you wanted to reach out to his hand and touch him to reassure him. He seemed so scared of you. \u201cRobb told me how talented you are, and I agree with him. Why aren\u2019t you playing out there with the rest of the bands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like big crowds.\u201d Jon took another look outside. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hot out there.\u201d You laughed once at his joke and quickly wrote it down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny, but you sing really serious music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer classic rock,\u201d Jon told you. \u201cI write my own music and preform that sometimes, but I want to be taken seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou write your own music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jon\u2019s hand massaged the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t perform it that much. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you up there. I think you\u2019re great!\u201d You smiled at him. Jon seemed to be a gentle soul. You watched his smile grow on his face. A pint was placed in front of you. Robb sat down between you both.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Robb asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Jon spoke before you. \u201cShe\u2019s really nice.\u201d You sighed and looked at Robb.<br>\u201cYou told him about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Robb shrugged. \u201cI told him that a pretty nice girl was going to interview him today and he agreed to it.\u201d Jon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, you said that a very pretty and a very nice girl was going to interview me,\u201d Jon corrected. Your eyes immediately watched Robb for his reaction. His eyes narrowed at his brother, but then softened towards you.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d you smugly smiled. Robb cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cJust interview him and you,\u201d Robb pointed at Jon. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d Without as much as a goodbye, Robb left the pub, leaving you and Jon alone.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m pretty?\u201d you asked Jon. Both of you started to laugh. Jon stopped laughing first and looked at you.</p><p>\u201cHe was right though. You are pretty. And nice. You are very nice,\u201d Jon almost stumbled over his words. You couldn\u2019t help but smile at him. The interview continued. You asked Jon more questions about him, his music, and who he would like to see win.</p><p>\u201cRenly and Stag Knight,\u201d Jon answered.</p><p>\u201cNot yourself?\u201d you asked, keeping the back of the pen near your mouth. Jon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think Renly and his friends deserve it more. I just like doing music. I don\u2019t need to win anything.\u201d You felt your heart swell. Jon was so selfless that you wanted him to do nothing but hand puppies to other people. Because of course that\u2019s a career that selfless people should do. Hand puppies to people and make them happy.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jon.\u201d You closed your notebook. \u201cI got everything I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jon watched you stand up from your spot and began speaking again. \u201cRobb told me you\u2019re new to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, yeah,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna stick around? Maybe have another pint? Couldn\u2019t hurt to make more friends?\u201d Jon\u2019s fingers played with the pint glass in his hand. His smile was more genuine than any smile you\u2019d ever seen. You glanced at your phone and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI really wish I could, but I am on assignment. I need to write up this interview for the website,\u201d you frowned at him. You wish you could spend more time with Jon. After interviewing him, you realized how much he loved music and only wanted to play it for people to listen, not to be popular.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I understand. Working for my brother can be hard sometimes,\u201d Jon led you to the door. \u201cJust let me know if he\u2019s a hardass on you, ok?\u201d</p><p>You nodded. Before you could officially say goodbye to him, Jon unlocked his parked car on the curb.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna give me a ride?\u201d you asked. \u201cYou just met me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jon continued. \u201cMy mother, well, Cat\u2019s not really my mom, but she taught me to be polite always. Now, you could walk back to your office, or you can jump in here, avoid the heat, and get to your office faster.\u201d The choice was obvious. You jumped in Jon\u2019s car and he drove you a mere ten minutes back to the headquarters.</p><p>Once you sat at your desk and had your notes open, you realized you never left your number with Jon. He had been so kind to you and so genuine. You groaned loudly as your hands melted into your face. How could you be so stupid?</p><p>You sighed once more and started typing the article for The Scene website. There was one thing you could do for Jon. You could make him known and give him the recognition he really deserved.

The weather woman on your tv went on about how warm it would be today, and she was also excited for the Battle of the Bands.</p>[[MORE]]<p>For once the weather woman was right. You stuck your hand out a window letting it catch the sun\u2019s warmth. It was going to be a lovely day. You slipped on shorts, a cut-up band t-shirt, and sneakers. It would suffice for spending all day at a music festival.</p><p>You almost took your car keys when you remembered that you had a city bus pass. What better way to start your article than to see other people get excited for the event itself? You left your car keys at home, and headed straight for the bus stop. Families with kids in AC/DC t-shirts and girls with flower crowns made you smile. The bus was filled with people all going to the city festival. You turned to see a young boy adjusting his baseball cap. You looked towards his parents who were occupied with his little sister, but you caught the mother\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cHi! Sorry to bother you,\u201d you glanced back at her son. \u201cI\u2019m a writer for The Scene. I was wondering if I could ask your son some questions about Battle of the Bands?\u201d</p><p>The mother smiled and nodded. \u201cOf course! Dominic, she would like to ask you some questions.\u201d The mother put her son in front of you. Dominic sat down in a bus seat, and you kneeled in front of him, balancing on your feet as the bus moved forward.</p><p>\u201cHi Dominic, are you excited for today?\u201d you asked the child. He nodded, keeping his eyes on you.</p><p>\u201cTell her who we\u2019re going to see,\u201d the mother nudged him. The little boy smiled and shied away from you.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, you can tell me,\u201d you said, smiling. Dominic looked down, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cBlackfyre,\u201d he said, in an almost whisper. \u201cI like them a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father is a fan of theirs. He played Blackfyre in front of Dominic so much that Dominic started to love them,\u201d she told you. You wrote down quick notes for yourself. The mother went on. \u201cI even caught him shredding the guitar to one of their songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really? Do you wanna be a rockstar when you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Dominic shouted with excitement. His hands raised up in the air as if he was on a roller coaster. You stood up from your spot as the bus slowed down.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. I got what I need,\u201d you nodded to the mother once more before you hopped off the bus. You put away your notebook and continued down the downtown street. First, Margie. Then Battle. This was going to be a busy first day.</p><p>Margaery finished off her second mimosa of the day and knocked on the bar. \u201cAnother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut you off if you don\u2019t slow down!\u201d Loras immediately called out to her. Margie rolled her eyes and put her focus back on you.</p><p>\u201cBlackfyre huh?\u201d she recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s Viserys Targaryen\u2019s band. He\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Think he may win the battle?\u201d you scooped up a breakfast taco filled with eggs and sausage. <br>\u201cHe actually might,\u201d Margie nodded seriously. \u201cHis band reminds a lot of the adults of their classic rock days, but he has a reach on their younger teens. He\u2019s a good looking guy with a lot of talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on him,\u201d you said, taking another bite. \u201cWhat the fuck is in these tacos? They\u2019re like crack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Margie said, eyes wide on her own breakfast. She looked towards her brother and then back to you. \u201cDo you want to do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of favor?\u201d you asked, knowing fully well this meant trouble for you.</p><p>Margie shot a look towards her brother. \u201cIt\u2019s about Renly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want me to spy on him? Like we used to do on the internet?\u201d you chuckled. Margie almost spat out her drink. Remembering your long distance internet days brought back joyful memories of you searching and stalking Margie\u2019s love interests. You dug so hard into one of their social media profile\u2019s that you found their SAT score. Margie was so impressed that she almost hired you to do more private investigative work.</p><p>\u201cYes, but no,\u201d Margie beckoned for you to come closer, obviously not wanting her brother to hear. \u201cLoras really needs this. He\u2019s been lonely and depressed. Maybe encourage Renly to hang with Loras sometime? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to push him into a relationship, but he needs something. Someone. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see Renly today. Along with Robb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cute boss?\u201d Margie gushed. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna flirt with him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he has a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d Margie winked. \u201cFlirt with him and then tell me about it.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t matter what you argued with Margaery, you wanted to flirt with him anyways. Once you stepped into the festival, you were grateful for your heat-friendly outfit.</p><p>The festival had several booths up front. Some where you could play games to win small prizes, others were advertising their local businesses. You recognized a young man standing in line at a booth to the side. You squinted to see his slender form, sunglasses, and his hands in his pockets while talking to another person beside him.</p><p>\u201cRenly? Renly Baratheon?\u201d you called out. The young man turned around to see you. He smiled and beckoned for you to come over.</p><p>\u201cHi! I\u2019ve seen you in the office. Heard you got my assignment, yeah?\u201d Renly smiled. He extended his hand out for you to shake. You gladly took it.</p><p>\u201cI did, yes.\u201d You looked beside Renly and recognized his conversation partner. \u201cHi, Robb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! You made it. Welcome to Battle of the Bands,\u201d Robb looked ahead of the line. \u201cI was trying to get everyone\u2019s press badges, but it seems they\u2019re really short staffed this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d you commented seeing the long line ahead of you. \u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d</p><p>Robb frowned and scratched the back of his neck. He shared one look with Renly and turned to you. \u201cThere was an incident last year. Someone on staff was harassed and it made news. People have been hesitant to join festival staff and press after that. I\u2019m honestly lucky to have you here.\u201d</p><p>Robb gave you a grateful smile and you returned it right back to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you gave me this opportunity,\u201d you returned the compliment. The line moved forward much more, but you continued the conversation. \u201cSo, I hear you\u2019re playing in the Battle this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Renly started off. \u201cStag Knight is ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStag Knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA play off my family\u2019s tradition and name.\u201d Renly wore a confident smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s a nod to my ancestors who were excellent hunters, but I don\u2019t believe in hurting animals myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vegetarian?\u201d you smiled, thinking ahead two steps. Renly nodded, patting his sack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got loads of my snacks in here today. If you need any water, come stop by, we\u2019ll have lots,\u201d Renly said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know I\u2019m new to the city, but there\u2019s this great taco place that serves amazing vegetarian friendly tacos\u2014</p><p>\u201cSunspot!\u201d Renly cut you off. \u201cI love that place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to know one of the bartenders there,\u201d you added. \u201cLoras is so much fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoras?\u201d Renly thought. \u201cThe cute guy with curls? He always seemed so shy to me.\u201d You held in your excitement at his comment and continued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really not. He\u2019s so much fun. We should all hang out sometime!\u201d There it was, your move. Renly nodded and turned to Robb.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun! We should.\u201d Bingo. Margie had always commended you on how you played your social chess. Sometimes, she would claim you were better than her. You weren\u2019t sure of that, but you knew you were going to get credit for this somehow.</p><p>Once you got your press badge, Renly parted ways with you and Robb. He trotted off quickly to rehearse before going on stage later that day. Robb put his badge over his head and looked at the schedule.</p><p>\u201cSo, who do we go to first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you pulled out your notes. \u201cI interviewed a little boy on the bus who was excited to see Blackfyre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Viserys,\u201d Robb chuckled. \u201cArrogant cock.\u201d You took a step back.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026not terribly nice,\u201d Robb walked with you through the festival. You heard alternative rock from one side of you. A crowd of people held their phones up to record. \u201cHe\u2019s had a taste of success already. He\u2019s talented, but it\u2019s gone to his head. Maybe it\u2019s best to stay away from him for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh okay,\u201d you looked down, feeling dejected. Robb patted your back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to follow this lead or that I don\u2019t trust you,\u201d Robb smiled. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to go interview him and come back in tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that bad?\u201d you responded.</p><p>Robb shrugged. \u201cSome say he is, some say differently. I just want to be cautious. I don\u2019t want to lose a good writer on the first day.\u201d You smiled, feeling the warmth of the compliment.</p><p>Robb pointed to a pub on the corner of the street, a bit away from the festival. Both of you crossed the street and entered inside the Irish-themed pub. Inside, there was no leprechauns or four-leaf clovers. Instead, there was old pictures of Ireland, showcasing ancestors and family trees. The Ireland flag hung proudly. You feel the cool air of the air conditioning, and you silently thanked Robb for saving you from the heat.</p><p>People spoke silently while they drank their pints. Other listened intently to the musician on the small stage. A guitar played a slow beat beautifully. Your eyes wandered to the artist. He wore boots and jeans. His flannel shirt was open to reveal his white tank underneath. It fit him tight. A shadow of a beard looked good on his face. His curls were much darker than Robb\u2019s. Then the idea clicked.</p><p>\u201cThis is my half-brother, Jon,\u201d Robb whispered. \u201cI thought he would be a great first interview for you. And vice versa.\u201d You inched forward and found a seat near the stage. Jon\u2019s voice was a low and slow harmony. You listened intently to the lyrics.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m a cowboy on a steel horse I ride<br>I\u2019m wanted, dead or alive.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cBon Jovi,\u201d you smiled, nodding along. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him like this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon\u2019s good for that,\u201d Robb smiled proudly. \u201cHe has the talent I wish I had. He doesn\u2019t do big audiences. He likes it small like this.\u201d Jon kept singing. His voice belted out the last few lyrics. Once he finished, the crowd in the pub applauded loudly for him. A few stood up and gave him whoops of joy. Jon smiled and nodded \u2018thank yous\u2019 to where he could until his eyes fell to you.</p><p>You watched his heart skip a beat, and you couldn\u2019t hide your own blush rushing to your cheeks. Jon was adorable, and you hadn\u2019t spoken a single word to him yet. You wanted to slap yourself in the face. If Robb was attractive, of course his brother would be just as attractive. Duh. Jon walked down from the stage and walked towards your table with Robb.</p><p>\u201cGood job!\u201d Robb embraced Jon. He patted him on the back and then turned to you. \u201cThis is Y/N. She\u2019s taking over for Renly this year.\u201d Jon sheepishly smiled at you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab some drinks, yeah?\u201d Robb offered. \u201cPints?\u201d When both of you nodded, Robb took off to the bar while you and Jon sat down.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to interview me?\u201d Jon said. He bit his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t ask hard questions,\u201d you wanted to reach out to his hand and touch him to reassure him. He seemed so scared of you. \u201cRobb told me how talented you are, and I agree with him. Why aren\u2019t you playing out there with the rest of the bands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like big crowds.\u201d Jon took another look outside. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hot out there.\u201d You laughed once at his joke and quickly wrote it down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny, but you sing really serious music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer classic rock,\u201d Jon told you. \u201cI write my own music and preform that sometimes, but I want to be taken seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou write your own music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jon\u2019s hand massaged the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t perform it that much. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you up there. I think you\u2019re great!\u201d You smiled at him. Jon seemed to be a gentle soul. You watched his smile grow on his face. A pint was placed in front of you. Robb sat down between you both.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Robb asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Jon spoke before you. \u201cShe\u2019s really nice.\u201d You sighed and looked at Robb.<br>\u201cYou told him about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Robb shrugged. \u201cI told him that a pretty nice girl was going to interview him today and he agreed to it.\u201d Jon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, you said that a very pretty and a very nice girl was going to interview me,\u201d Jon corrected. Your eyes immediately watched Robb for his reaction. His eyes narrowed at his brother, but then softened towards you.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d you smugly smiled. Robb cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cJust interview him and you,\u201d Robb pointed at Jon. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d Without as much as a goodbye, Robb left the pub, leaving you and Jon alone.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m pretty?\u201d you asked Jon. Both of you started to laugh. Jon stopped laughing first and looked at you.</p><p>\u201cHe was right though. You are pretty. And nice. You are very nice,\u201d Jon almost stumbled over his words. You couldn\u2019t help but smile at him. The interview continued. You asked Jon more questions about him, his music, and who he would like to see win.</p><p>\u201cRenly and Stag Knight,\u201d Jon answered.</p><p>\u201cNot yourself?\u201d you asked, keeping the back of the pen near your mouth. Jon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think Renly and his friends deserve it more. I just like doing music. I don\u2019t need to win anything.\u201d You felt your heart swell. Jon was so selfless that you wanted him to do nothing but hand puppies to other people. Because of course that\u2019s a career that selfless people should do. Hand puppies to people and make them happy.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jon.\u201d You closed your notebook. \u201cI got everything I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jon watched you stand up from your spot and began speaking again. \u201cRobb told me you\u2019re new to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, yeah,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna stick around? Maybe have another pint? Couldn\u2019t hurt to make more friends?\u201d Jon\u2019s fingers played with the pint glass in his hand. His smile was more genuine than any smile you\u2019d ever seen. You glanced at your phone and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI really wish I could, but I am on assignment. I need to write up this interview for the website,\u201d you frowned at him.

The weather woman on your tv went on about how warm it would be today, and she was also excited for the Battle of the Bands.</p><p>For once the weather woman was right. You stuck your hand out a window letting it catch the sun&rsquo;s warmth. It was going to be a lovely day. You slipped on shorts, a cut-up band t-shirt, and sneakers. It would suffice for spending all day at a music festival.</p><p>You almost took your car keys when you remembered that you had a city bus pass. What better way to start your article than to see other people get excited for the event itself? You left your car keys at home, and headed straight for the bus stop. Families with kids in AC/DC t-shirts and girls with flower crowns made you smile. The bus was filled with people all going to the city festival. You turned to see a young boy adjusting his baseball cap. You looked towards his parents who were occupied with his little sister, but you caught the mother&rsquo;s eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi! Sorry to bother you,&rdquo; you glanced back at her son. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a writer for The Scene. I was wondering if I could ask your son some questions about Battle of the Bands?&rdquo;</p><p>The mother smiled and nodded. &ldquo;Of course! Dominic, she would like to ask you some questions.&rdquo; The mother put her son in front of you. Dominic sat down in a bus seat, and you kneeled in front of him, balancing on your feet as the bus moved forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Dominic, are you excited for today?&rdquo; you asked the child. He nodded, keeping his eyes on you.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell her who we&rsquo;re going to see,&rdquo; the mother nudged him. The little boy smiled and shied away from you.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, come on, you can tell me,&rdquo; you said, smiling. Dominic looked down, still smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Blackfyre,&rdquo; he said, in an almost whisper. &ldquo;I like them a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His father is a fan of theirs. He played Blackfyre in front of Dominic so much that Dominic started to love them,&rdquo; she told you. You wrote down quick notes for yourself. The mother went on. &ldquo;I even caught him shredding the guitar to one of their songs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh really? Do you wanna be a rockstar when you grow up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Dominic shouted with excitement. His hands raised up in the air as if he was on a roller coaster. You stood up from your spot as the bus slowed down.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much. I got what I need,&rdquo; you nodded to the mother once more before you hopped off the bus. You put away your notebook and continued down the downtown street. First, Margie. Then Battle. This was going to be a busy first day.</p><p>Margaery finished off her second mimosa of the day and knocked on the bar. &ldquo;Another!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut you off if you don&rsquo;t slow down!&rdquo; Loras immediately called out to her. Margie rolled her eyes and put her focus back on you.</p><p>&ldquo;Blackfyre huh?&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Viserys Targaryen&rsquo;s band. He&rsquo;s really good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? Think he may win the battle?&rdquo; you scooped up a breakfast taco filled with eggs and sausage. <br />&ldquo;He actually might,&rdquo; Margie nodded seriously. &ldquo;His band reminds a lot of the adults of their classic rock days, but he has a reach on their younger teens. He&rsquo;s a good looking guy with a lot of talent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on him,&rdquo; you said, taking another bite. &ldquo;What the fuck is in these tacos? They&rsquo;re like crack.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Margie said, eyes wide on her own breakfast. She looked towards her brother and then back to you. &ldquo;Do you want to do me a favor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of favor?&rdquo; you asked, knowing fully well this meant trouble for you.</p><p>Margie shot a look towards her brother. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Renly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? You want me to spy on him? Like we used to do on the internet?&rdquo; you chuckled. Margie almost spat out her drink. Remembering your long distance internet days brought back joyful memories of you searching and stalking Margie&rsquo;s love interests. You dug so hard into one of their social media profile&rsquo;s that you found their SAT score. Margie was so impressed that she almost hired you to do more private investigative work.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but no,&rdquo; Margie beckoned for you to come closer, obviously not wanting her brother to hear. &ldquo;Loras really needs this. He&rsquo;s been lonely and depressed. Maybe encourage Renly to hang with Loras sometime? I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t want to push him into a relationship, but he needs something. Someone. Does that make sense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Renly today. Along with Robb.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The cute boss?&rdquo; Margie gushed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna flirt with him, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if he has a girlfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if he doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Margie winked. &ldquo;Flirt with him and then tell me about it.&rdquo; It wouldn&rsquo;t matter what you argued with Margaery, you wanted to flirt with him anyways. Once you stepped into the festival, you were grateful for your heat-friendly outfit.</p><p>The festival had several booths up front. Some where you could play games to win small prizes, others were advertising their local businesses. You recognized a young man standing in line at a booth to the side. You squinted to see his slender form, sunglasses, and his hands in his pockets while talking to another person beside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Renly? Renly Baratheon?&rdquo; you called out. The young man turned around to see you. He smiled and beckoned for you to come over.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi! I&rsquo;ve seen you in the office. Heard you got my assignment, yeah?&rdquo; Renly smiled. He extended his hand out for you to shake. You gladly took it.</p><p>&ldquo;I did, yes.&rdquo; You looked beside Renly and recognized his conversation partner. &ldquo;Hi, Robb.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! You made it. Welcome to Battle of the Bands,&rdquo; Robb looked ahead of the line. &ldquo;I was trying to get everyone&rsquo;s press badges, but it seems they&rsquo;re really short staffed this year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate,&rdquo; you commented seeing the long line ahead of you. &ldquo;Why do you think that is?&rdquo;</p><p>Robb frowned and scratched the back of his neck. He shared one look with Renly and turned to you. &ldquo;There was an incident last year. Someone on staff was harassed and it made news. People have been hesitant to join festival staff and press after that. I&rsquo;m honestly lucky to have you here.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb gave you a grateful smile and you returned it right back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you gave me this opportunity,&rdquo; you returned the compliment. The line moved forward much more, but you continued the conversation. &ldquo;So, I hear you&rsquo;re playing in the Battle this year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Renly started off. &ldquo;Stag Knight is ready to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stag Knight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A play off my family&rsquo;s tradition and name.&rdquo; Renly wore a confident smile on his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nod to my ancestors who were excellent hunters, but I don&rsquo;t believe in hurting animals myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a vegetarian?&rdquo; you smiled, thinking ahead two steps. Renly nodded, patting his sack.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got loads of my snacks in here today. If you need any water, come stop by, we&rsquo;ll have lots,&rdquo; Renly said.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I know I&rsquo;m new to the city, but there&rsquo;s this great taco place that serves amazing vegetarian friendly tacos&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sunspot!&rdquo; Renly cut you off. &ldquo;I love that place!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I happen to know one of the bartenders there,&rdquo; you added. &ldquo;Loras is so much fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Loras?&rdquo; Renly thought. &ldquo;The cute guy with curls? He always seemed so shy to me.&rdquo; You held in your excitement at his comment and continued.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s really not. He&rsquo;s so much fun. We should all hang out sometime!&rdquo; There it was, your move. Renly nodded and turned to Robb.</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like fun! We should.&rdquo; Bingo. Margie had always commended you on how you played your social chess. Sometimes, she would claim you were better than her. You weren&rsquo;t sure of that, but you knew you were going to get credit for this somehow.</p><p>Once you got your press badge, Renly parted ways with you and Robb. He trotted off quickly to rehearse before going on stage later that day. Robb put his badge over his head and looked at the schedule.</p><p>&ldquo;So, who do we go to first?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you pulled out your notes. &ldquo;I interviewed a little boy on the bus who was excited to see Blackfyre.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Viserys,&rdquo; Robb chuckled. &ldquo;Arrogant cock.&rdquo; You took a step back.</p><p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip;not terribly nice,&rdquo; Robb walked with you through the festival. You heard alternative rock from one side of you. A crowd of people held their phones up to record. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had a taste of success already. He&rsquo;s talented, but it&rsquo;s gone to his head. Maybe it&rsquo;s best to stay away from him for now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh okay,&rdquo; you looked down, feeling dejected. Robb patted your back.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want you to follow this lead or that I don&rsquo;t trust you,&rdquo; Robb smiled. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want you to go interview him and come back in tears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s that bad?&rdquo; you responded.</p><p>Robb shrugged. &ldquo;Some say he is, some say differently. I just want to be cautious. I don&rsquo;t want to lose a good writer on the first day.&rdquo; You smiled, feeling the warmth of the compliment.</p><p>Robb pointed to a pub on the corner of the street, a bit away from the festival. Both of you crossed the street and entered inside the Irish-themed pub. Inside, there was no leprechauns or four-leaf clovers. Instead, there was old pictures of Ireland, showcasing ancestors and family trees. The Ireland flag hung proudly. You feel the cool air of the air conditioning, and you silently thanked Robb for saving you from the heat.</p><p>People spoke silently while they drank their pints. Other listened intently to the musician on the small stage. A guitar played a slow beat beautifully. Your eyes wandered to the artist. He wore boots and jeans. His flannel shirt was open to reveal his white tank underneath. It fit him tight. A shadow of a beard looked good on his face. His curls were much darker than Robb&rsquo;s. Then the idea clicked.</p><p>&ldquo;This is my half-brother, Jon,&rdquo; Robb whispered. &ldquo;I thought he would be a great first interview for you. And vice versa.&rdquo; You inched forward and found a seat near the stage. Jon&rsquo;s voice was a low and slow harmony. You listened intently to the lyrics.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a cowboy on a steel horse I ride<br />I&rsquo;m wanted, dead or alive.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Bon Jovi,&rdquo; you smiled, nodding along. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard him like this before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon&rsquo;s good for that,&rdquo; Robb smiled proudly. &ldquo;He has the talent I wish I had. He doesn&rsquo;t do big audiences. He likes it small like this.&rdquo; Jon kept singing. His voice belted out the last few lyrics. Once he finished, the crowd in the pub applauded loudly for him. A few stood up and gave him whoops of joy. Jon smiled and nodded &lsquo;thank yous&rsquo; to where he could until his eyes fell to you.</p><p>You watched his heart skip a beat, and you couldn&rsquo;t hide your own blush rushing to your cheeks. Jon was adorable, and you hadn&rsquo;t spoken a single word to him yet. You wanted to slap yourself in the face. If Robb was attractive, of course his brother would be just as attractive. Duh. Jon walked down from the stage and walked towards your table with Robb.</p><p>&ldquo;Good job!&rdquo; Robb embraced Jon. He patted him on the back and then turned to you. &ldquo;This is Y/N. She&rsquo;s taking over for Renly this year.&rdquo; Jon sheepishly smiled at you.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you,&rdquo; he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grab some drinks, yeah?&rdquo; Robb offered. &ldquo;Pints?&rdquo; When both of you nodded, Robb took off to the bar while you and Jon sat down.</p><p>&ldquo;So, are you going to interview me?&rdquo; Jon said. He bit his lower lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t ask hard questions,&rdquo; you wanted to reach out to his hand and touch him to reassure him. He seemed so scared of you. &ldquo;Robb told me how talented you are, and I agree with him. Why aren&rsquo;t you playing out there with the rest of the bands?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like big crowds.&rdquo; Jon took another look outside. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s hot out there.&rdquo; You laughed once at his joke and quickly wrote it down.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re funny, but you sing really serious music.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I prefer classic rock,&rdquo; Jon told you. &ldquo;I write my own music and preform that sometimes, but I want to be taken seriously.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You write your own music?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s hand massaged the back of his neck. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t perform it that much. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard you up there. I think you&rsquo;re great!&rdquo; You smiled at him. Jon seemed to be a gentle soul. You watched his smile grow on his face. A pint was placed in front of you. Robb sat down between you both.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; Robb asked.</p><p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; Jon spoke before you. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s really nice.&rdquo; You sighed and looked at Robb.<br />&ldquo;You told him about me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Robb shrugged. &ldquo;I told him that a pretty nice girl was going to interview him today and he agreed to it.&rdquo; Jon shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you said that a very pretty and a very nice girl was going to interview me,&rdquo; Jon corrected. Your eyes immediately watched Robb for his reaction. His eyes narrowed at his brother, but then softened towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m pretty?&rdquo; you smugly smiled. Robb cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Just interview him and you,&rdquo; Robb pointed at Jon. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid.&rdquo; Without as much as a goodbye, Robb left the pub, leaving you and Jon alone.</p><p>&ldquo;He thinks I&rsquo;m pretty?&rdquo; you asked Jon. Both of you started to laugh. Jon stopped laughing first and looked at you.</p><p>&ldquo;He was right though. You are pretty. And nice. You are very nice,&rdquo; Jon almost stumbled over his words. You couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at him. The interview continued. You asked Jon more questions about him, his music, and who he would like to see win.</p><p>&ldquo;Renly and Stag Knight,&rdquo; Jon answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Not yourself?&rdquo; you asked, keeping the back of the pen near your mouth. Jon shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I think Renly and his friends deserve it more. I just like doing music. I don&rsquo;t need to win anything.&rdquo; You felt your heart swell. Jon was so selfless that you wanted him to do nothing but hand puppies to other people. Because of course that&rsquo;s a career that selfless people should do. Hand puppies to people and make them happy.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jon.&rdquo; You closed your notebook. &ldquo;I got everything I need.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Jon watched you stand up from your spot and began speaking again. &ldquo;Robb told me you&rsquo;re new to town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am, yeah,&rdquo; you nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna stick around? Maybe have another pint? Couldn&rsquo;t hurt to make more friends?&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s fingers played with the pint glass in his hand. His smile was more genuine than any smile you&rsquo;d ever seen. You glanced at your phone and sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;I really wish I could, but I am on assignment. I need to write up this interview for the website,&rdquo; you frowned at him. You wish you could spend more time with Jon. After interviewing him, you realized how much he loved music and only wanted to play it for people to listen, not to be popular.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I understand. Working for my brother can be hard sometimes,&rdquo; Jon led you to the door. &ldquo;Just let me know if he&rsquo;s a hardass on you, ok?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded. Before you could officially say goodbye to him, Jon unlocked his parked car on the curb.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna give me a ride?&rdquo; you asked. &ldquo;You just met me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jon continued. &ldquo;My mother, well, Cat&rsquo;s not really my mom, but she taught me to be polite always. Now, you could walk back to your office, or you can jump in here, avoid the heat, and get to your office faster.&rdquo; The choice was obvious. You jumped in Jon&rsquo;s car and he drove you a mere ten minutes back to the headquarters.</p><p>Once you sat at your desk and had your notes open, you realized you never left your number with Jon.
