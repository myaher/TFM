He blinked the grogginess from his eyes, his brain still not quite awake enough to process anything. His heart filled with despair and agony as he remembered his thoughts from yesterday. Of course, he didn\u2019t want Dan dead but almost anything was better than what he was going through now. A tear sprung from his eye as he looked down at Dan\u2019s shirtless body, the words he had carved yesterday were bright red compared to the fading of the words from the previous days. Rage spread through his body because he had been the one made to cause Dan this pain. Phil didn\u2019t know if either one of them would make it out of this alive, but he knows one thing for sure\u2014if he ever got the chance he would kill this man.</p><p>Phil\u2019s arms were killing him as they were still tied behind his back. He wiggled his hands slightly to try and get in a more comfortable position, feeling the blood quickly rush back into his fingertips with the movement. He did notice though that some of the ropes seemed to have loosened somewhat; he figured if he moved his hands around enough maybe he would be able to slip out of them.</p><p>With Phil set to work on that, he didn\u2019t even notice Dan had woken up until he started to squirm.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Daddy, what are you doing?\u201d </b></i>he whined into his chest.</p><p>He jumped slightly, startled, but easily relaxed. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cSorry, love, I\u2019m trying to get out of these ropes,\u201d </i></b>he sighed.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI wanna help,\u201d</b></i> Dan said, hissing in pain as he moved off Phil\u2019s chest and started to work on the ropes.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before Phil was able to slip his hands out. The first thing he did with his newly freed hands wrapped them tight around Dan, feeling moisture spring to his eyes. They sat there for a while before the door opened.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAww, would you look at that. Isn\u2019t that just so sweet,\u201d </i></b>he spit out, a dark look in his eye.</p><p>Dan buried his face deeper into Phil, trying to make himself invisible.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, since you managed to get yourself loose, I guess you want in on the fun too, huh?\u201d</i></b> he smirked at Phil.</p><p>Phil glared at him wrapping his arms tighter around Dan.</p><p>Their captor sauntered over and roughly grabbed Phil\u2019s arm, trying to get him to let go of Dan. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cStop it! Please just leave us alone! Haven&rsquo;t you caused both of us enough pain?!\u201d</i></b> he screamed and pleaded with him. In a small, rational corner of his brain, Phil knew he probably should use his freedom to fight back, but he was just so scared.</p><p><i><b>\u201cShut up fag!\u201d </b></i>he yanked harder, managing to get Dan free of his arms.</p><p><i><b>\u201cNo, daddy, please!</b></i>\u201d Dan cried as the man dragged Phil away from him.</p><p>Dan crawled his way over and that earned him a hard slap in the face that sent him flying across the room. He moaned in pain as he cradled his face in his hands.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPlease, stop it!\u201d </b></i>Phil pleaded, trying to fight back, but to no avail as he harshly yanked both Phil&rsquo;s pants down. He was weak from everything that had happened, and their captor was too strong. He didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. \u00a0</p><p>Without any preparation, he forced himself inside of Phil. Phil wanted to be strong for Dan, but he couldn\u2019t stop the tears that fell down his face as his mouth opened in a silent scream. It felt like someone had shoved something on fire inside of him. \u00a0</p><p>He was so consumed by what was happening he almost didn\u2019t hear the groan come from the other side of the room.</p><p><i><b>\u201cP&hellip;Phil?\u201d</b></i> his head snapped towards Dan who&rsquo;s shape was blurred by Phil&rsquo;s tears.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He was rubbing his eyes and had a look of confusion written on his face.</p><p>More tears fell from Phil\u2019s eyes. This could be a fluke\u2014he could slip back at any time, but at the moment he was pretty sure his Dan was back.</p><p>Lucky for Dan, the man being so enthralled in what he was doing he hadn\u2019t heard him.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes snapped to what was happening, several emotions crossing his face at once. Confusion, fear, anger, and hatred all blurring by. He didn\u2019t know exactly what was happening, but he knew at this moment, Phil needed his help. He quickly crawled his way over and jumped on the man\u2019s back, feeling rage surge through his veins.</p><p>The man screamed as Dan bit him in the neck, ripping out a chunk of skin. He was roughly pushed to the floor and kicked.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou fucking faggot why did you do that?!\u201d</i></b> The man screamed as he kicked him a few more times. \u00a0</p><p>The man cupped his neck to stop the bleeding and quickly left the room, cursing and yelling threats at them.</p><p>Leaving Dan and Phil alone for the first time in a long time.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Dan sat quietly in the corner his arms wrapped around his knees, his brain trying to process everything Phil had just told him through tears and sobs. He remembered some of it, but other parts were more of a black haze. If he hadn\u2019t had experienced some of it for himself he would have thought Phil was lying to him with how sick a twisted it all sounded. He couldn\u2019t believe not only this happened, but he had been permanently stuck in little space the last two weeks. That is the longest he had ever gone with not being able to regress back. Phil had told him he feared Dan might never come back. Dan\u2019s emotions where all over the place and his brain was having a really tough time trying to process everything. He was stuck in denial.</p><p>Phil had tried to hold him after he explained the events of the past two weeks, but Dan had yanked away from him not wanting to be touched by anyone at the moment. Phil had looked hurt, but let Dan fold into himself, leaving him alone to his own thoughts. He knows it was selfish after everything Phil had done for him, but he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of anyone touching him at the moment. He felt dirty, ruined and worthless and on top, that he hurt literally everywhere.</p><p>Tears welled in his eyes as he looked down at his stomach again and at the words carved into his body.</p><p>After the last few hours his body and mind where exhausted, and he had to fight his eyes to keep them open. He was terrified if he let himself sleep he might not wake back up and regress again instead. He was scared. Scared of regressing, scared of his circumstances, scared of what would happen next.</p><p>Phil watched as Dan fought the tiredness that was surely washing over him. He had just spent the last hour traumatizing Dan all over again. He had tried to leave out as much of the details as he could but Dan had told him he remembered some of it. He hadn\u2019t gone into details about what he remembered, but the look on his face was enough that Phil didn\u2019t ask and he wasn\u2019t sure he really wanted to know. \u00a0</p><p>When Phil had tried hugging him, Dan flung himself away and cowered into the corner. He would be lying if he said it didn\u2019t hurt him but he also could understand what Dan was going through at the moment.</p><p>Phil was happy big Dan was back, but it tore his heart to shreds having to relive everything. But he knew Dan deserved the truth of what had happened.</p><p>Sir hadn\u2019t been back since Dan had bitten him, but he didn\u2019t figure it would be much longer until he came back. He never left them for more than a few hours at a time. But that, of course, was before Dan had fought back.</p><p>Phil leaned his head back against the wall, closing his eyes, hoping to get a few hours of sleep before sir came back.</p><p>Dan watched Phil close his eyes and sighed. He was done with being alone with his thoughts. He crawled over to Phil and lightly touched him on the shoulder.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhilly, can we cuddle?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil jumped slightly, either from sleep or not hearing Dan shuffle over.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOf course. Come here.&ldquo; </b></i>He smiled slightly and opened his arms.</p><p>Dan crawled into his lap and rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d</b></i> he mumbled so softly he wasn\u2019t sure if Phil heard him or not.</p><p>But apparently, he had because Phil just wrapped his arms tighter around his waist and pressed a kiss on his head.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, love.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Not being able to fight the tiredness anymore, he let his eyes close, just being content to be with Phil at this moment.</p>",

He wiggled his hands slightly to try and get in a more comfortable position, feeling the blood quickly rush back into his fingertips with the movement. He did notice though that some of the ropes seemed to have loosened somewhat; he figured if he moved his hands around enough maybe he would be able to slip out of them.</p><p>With Phil set to work on that, he didn\u2019t even notice Dan had woken up until he started to squirm.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Daddy, what are you doing?\u201d </b></i>he whined into his chest.</p><p>He jumped slightly, startled, but easily relaxed. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cSorry, love, I\u2019m trying to get out of these ropes,\u201d </i></b>he sighed.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI wanna help,\u201d</b></i> Dan said, hissing in pain as he moved off Phil\u2019s chest and started to work on the ropes.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before Phil was able to slip his hands out. The first thing he did with his newly freed hands wrapped them tight around Dan, feeling moisture spring to his eyes. They sat there for a while before the door opened.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAww, would you look at that. Isn\u2019t that just so sweet,\u201d </i></b>he spit out, a dark look in his eye.</p><p>Dan buried his face deeper into Phil, trying to make himself invisible.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, since you managed to get yourself loose, I guess you want in on the fun too, huh?\u201d</i></b> he smirked at Phil.</p><p>Phil glared at him wrapping his arms tighter around Dan.</p><p>Their captor sauntered over and roughly grabbed Phil\u2019s arm, trying to get him to let go of Dan. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cStop it! Please just leave us alone! Haven\u2019t you caused both of us enough pain?!\u201d</i></b> he screamed and pleaded with him. In a small, rational corner of his brain, Phil knew he probably should use his freedom to fight back, but he was just so scared.</p><p><i><b>\u201cShut up fag!\u201d </b></i>he yanked harder, managing to get Dan free of his arms.</p><p><i><b>\u201cNo, daddy, please!</b></i>\u201d Dan cried as the man dragged Phil away from him.</p><p>Dan crawled his way over and that earned him a hard slap in the face that sent him flying across the room. He moaned in pain as he cradled his face in his hands.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPlease, stop it!\u201d </b></i>Phil pleaded, trying to fight back, but to no avail as he harshly yanked both Phil\u2019s pants down. He was weak from everything that had happened, and their captor was too strong. He didn\u2019t stand a chance. \u00a0</p><p>Without any preparation, he forced himself inside of Phil. Phil wanted to be strong for Dan, but he couldn\u2019t stop the tears that fell down his face as his mouth opened in a silent scream. It felt like someone had shoved something on fire inside of him. \u00a0</p><p>He was so consumed by what was happening he almost didn\u2019t hear the groan come from the other side of the room.</p><p><i><b>\u201cP\u2026Phil?\u201d</b></i> his head snapped towards Dan who\u2019s shape was blurred by Phil\u2019s tears.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He was rubbing his eyes and had a look of confusion written on his face.</p><p>More tears fell from Phil\u2019s eyes. This could be a fluke\u2014he could slip back at any time, but at the moment he was pretty sure his Dan was back.</p><p>Lucky for Dan, the man being so enthralled in what he was doing he hadn\u2019t heard him.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes snapped to what was happening, several emotions crossing his face at once. Confusion, fear, anger, and hatred all blurring by. He didn\u2019t know exactly what was happening, but he knew at this moment, Phil needed his help. He quickly crawled his way over and jumped on the man\u2019s back, feeling rage surge through his veins.</p><p>The man screamed as Dan bit him in the neck, ripping out a chunk of skin. He was roughly pushed to the floor and kicked.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou fucking faggot why did you do that?!\u201d</i></b> The man screamed as he kicked him a few more times. \u00a0</p><p>The man cupped his neck to stop the bleeding and quickly left the room, cursing and yelling threats at them.</p><p>Leaving Dan and Phil alone for the first time in a long time.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Dan sat quietly in the corner his arms wrapped around his knees, his brain trying to process everything Phil had just told him through tears and sobs. He remembered some of it, but other parts were more of a black haze. If he hadn\u2019t had experienced some of it for himself he would have thought Phil was lying to him with how sick a twisted it all sounded. He couldn\u2019t believe not only this happened, but he had been permanently stuck in little space the last two weeks. That is the longest he had ever gone with not being able to regress back. Phil had told him he feared Dan might never come back. Dan\u2019s emotions where all over the place and his brain was having a really tough time trying to process everything. He was stuck in denial.</p><p>Phil had tried to hold him after he explained the events of the past two weeks, but Dan had yanked away from him not wanting to be touched by anyone at the moment. Phil had looked hurt, but let Dan fold into himself, leaving him alone to his own thoughts. He knows it was selfish after everything Phil had done for him, but he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of anyone touching him at the moment. He felt dirty, ruined and worthless and on top, that he hurt literally everywhere.</p><p>Tears welled in his eyes as he looked down at his stomach again and at the words carved into his body.</p><p>After the last few hours his body and mind where exhausted, and he had to fight his eyes to keep them open. He was terrified if he let himself sleep he might not wake back up and regress again instead. He was scared. Scared of regressing, scared of his circumstances, scared of what would happen next.</p><p>Phil watched as Dan fought the tiredness that was surely washing over him. He had just spent the last hour traumatizing Dan all over again. He had tried to leave out as much of the details as he could but Dan had told him he remembered some of it. He hadn\u2019t gone into details about what he remembered, but the look on his face was enough that Phil didn\u2019t ask and he wasn\u2019t sure he really wanted to know. \u00a0</p><p>When Phil had tried hugging him, Dan flung himself away and cowered into the corner. He would be lying if he said it didn\u2019t hurt him but he also could understand what Dan was going through at the moment.</p><p>Phil was happy big Dan was back, but it tore his heart to shreds having to relive everything. But he knew Dan deserved the truth of what had happened.</p><p>Sir hadn\u2019t been back since Dan had bitten him, but he didn\u2019t figure it would be much longer until he came back. He never left them for more than a few hours at a time. But that, of course, was before Dan had fought back.</p><p>Phil leaned his head back against the wall, closing his eyes, hoping to get a few hours of sleep before sir came back.</p><p>Dan watched Phil close his eyes and sighed. He was done with being alone with his thoughts. He crawled over to Phil and lightly touched him on the shoulder.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhilly, can we cuddle?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil jumped slightly, either from sleep or not hearing Dan shuffle over.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOf course. Come here.\u201c </b></i>He smiled slightly and opened his arms.</p><p>Dan crawled into his lap and rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d</b></i> he mumbled so softly he wasn\u2019t sure if Phil heard him or not.</p><p>But apparently, he had because Phil just wrapped his arms tighter around his waist and pressed a kiss on his head.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, love.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Not being able to fight the tiredness anymore, he let his eyes close, just being content to be with Phil at this moment.</p>",

He blinked the grogginess from his eyes, his brain still not quite awake enough to process anything. His heart filled with despair and agony as he remembered his thoughts from yesterday. Of course, he didn\u2019t want Dan dead but almost anything was better than what he was going through now. A tear sprung from his eye as he looked down at Dan\u2019s shirtless body, the words he had carved yesterday were bright red compared to the fading of the words from the previous days.

Isn&rsquo;t that just so sweet,&rdquo; </i></b>he spit out, a dark look in his eye.</p><p>Dan buried his face deeper into Phil, trying to make himself invisible.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well, since you managed to get yourself loose, I guess you want in on the fun too, huh?&rdquo;</i></b> he smirked at Phil.</p><p>Phil glared at him wrapping his arms tighter around Dan.</p><p>Their captor sauntered over and roughly grabbed Phil&rsquo;s arm, trying to get him to let go of Dan. &nbsp;</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Stop it! Please just leave us alone! Haven&rsquo;t you caused both of us enough pain?!&rdquo;</i></b> he screamed and pleaded with him. In a small, rational corner of his brain, Phil knew he probably should use his freedom to fight back, but he was just so scared.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Shut up fag!&rdquo; </b></i>he yanked harder, managing to get Dan free of his arms.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;No, daddy, please!</b></i>&rdquo; Dan cried as the man dragged Phil away from him.</p><p>Dan crawled his way over and that earned him a hard slap in the face that sent him flying across the room. He moaned in pain as he cradled his face in his hands.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Please, stop it!&rdquo; </b></i>Phil pleaded, trying to fight back, but to no avail as he harshly yanked both Phil&rsquo;s pants down. He was weak from everything that had happened, and their captor was too strong. He didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. &nbsp;</p><p>Without any preparation, he forced himself inside of Phil. Phil wanted to be strong for Dan, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop the tears that fell down his face as his mouth opened in a silent scream. It felt like someone had shoved something on fire inside of him. &nbsp;</p><p>He was so consumed by what was happening he almost didn&rsquo;t hear the groan come from the other side of the room.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;P&hellip;Phil?&rdquo;</b></i> his head snapped towards Dan who&rsquo;s shape was blurred by Phil&rsquo;s tears.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He was rubbing his eyes and had a look of confusion written on his face.</p><p>More tears fell from Phil&rsquo;s eyes. This could be a fluke&mdash;he could slip back at any time, but at the moment he was pretty sure his Dan was back.</p><p>Lucky for Dan, the man being so enthralled in what he was doing he hadn&rsquo;t heard him.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes snapped to what was happening, several emotions crossing his face at once. Confusion, fear, anger, and hatred all blurring by. He didn&rsquo;t know exactly what was happening, but he knew at this moment, Phil needed his help. He quickly crawled his way over and jumped on the man&rsquo;s back, feeling rage surge through his veins.</p><p>The man screamed as Dan bit him in the neck, ripping out a chunk of skin. He was roughly pushed to the floor and kicked.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You fucking faggot why did you do that?!&rdquo;</i></b> The man screamed as he kicked him a few more times. &nbsp;</p><p>The man cupped his neck to stop the bleeding and quickly left the room, cursing and yelling threats at them.</p><p>Leaving Dan and Phil alone for the first time in a long time.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Dan sat quietly in the corner his arms wrapped around his knees, his brain trying to process everything Phil had just told him through tears and sobs. He remembered some of it, but other parts were more of a black haze. If he hadn&rsquo;t had experienced some of it for himself he would have thought Phil was lying to him with how sick a twisted it all sounded. He couldn&rsquo;t believe not only this happened, but he had been permanently stuck in little space the last two weeks. That is the longest he had ever gone with not being able to regress back. Phil had told him he feared Dan might never come back. Dan&rsquo;s emotions where all over the place and his brain was having a really tough time trying to process everything. He was stuck in denial.</p><p>Phil had tried to hold him after he explained the events of the past two weeks, but Dan had yanked away from him not wanting to be touched by anyone at the moment. Phil had looked hurt, but let Dan fold into himself, leaving him alone to his own thoughts. He knows it was selfish after everything Phil had done for him, but he couldn&rsquo;t stand the thought of anyone touching him at the moment. He felt dirty, ruined and worthless and on top, that he hurt literally everywhere.</p><p>Tears welled in his eyes as he looked down at his stomach again and at the words carved into his body.</p><p>After the last few hours his body and mind where exhausted, and he had to fight his eyes to keep them open. He was terrified if he let himself sleep he might not wake back up and regress again instead. He was scared. Scared of regressing, scared of his circumstances, scared of what would happen next.</p><p>Phil watched as Dan fought the tiredness that was surely washing over him. He had just spent the last hour traumatizing Dan all over again. He had tried to leave out as much of the details as he could but Dan had told him he remembered some of it. He hadn&rsquo;t gone into details about what he remembered, but the look on his face was enough that Phil didn&rsquo;t ask and he wasn&rsquo;t sure he really wanted to know. &nbsp;</p><p>When Phil had tried hugging him, Dan flung himself away and cowered into the corner. He would be lying if he said it didn&rsquo;t hurt him but he also could understand what Dan was going through at the moment.</p><p>Phil was happy big Dan was back, but it tore his heart to shreds having to relive everything. But he knew Dan deserved the truth of what had happened.</p><p>Sir hadn&rsquo;t been back since Dan had bitten him, but he didn&rsquo;t figure it would be much longer until he came back. He never left them for more than a few hours at a time. But that, of course, was before Dan had fought back.</p><p>Phil leaned his head back against the wall, closing his eyes, hoping to get a few hours of sleep before sir came back.</p><p>Dan watched Phil close his eyes and sighed. He was done with being alone with his thoughts. He crawled over to Phil and lightly touched him on the shoulder.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Philly, can we cuddle?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil jumped slightly, either from sleep or not hearing Dan shuffle over.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Of course. Come here.&ldquo; </b></i>He smiled slightly and opened his arms.</p><p>Dan crawled into his lap and rested his head on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;</b></i> he mumbled so softly he wasn&rsquo;t sure if Phil heard him or not.</p><p>But apparently, he had because Phil just wrapped his arms tighter around his waist and pressed a kiss on his head.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You have nothing to be sorry for, love.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Not being able to fight the tiredness anymore, he let his eyes close, just being content to be with Phil at this moment.</p>",
