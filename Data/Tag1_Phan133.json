The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Chapter Four</b></p><p>The night passes the same way - barely concealed crying, slightly ominous but mostly lovely music to drift him off to sleep - and then morning comes, stark and bright as usual. Dan gets dressed, begs Louise for coffee and sustenance -\u00a0<i>\u201cdid you find him?\u201d \u201cyes\u201d \u201cwere you nice?\u201d \u201cI was a peach\u201d \u201cwhat did he say?\u201d \u201che said he was sorry for yelling\u201d \u201caw, told you he was a sweetie deep down\u201d \u201cmmhmm\u201d -</i>\u00a0and is then rounded up by Mona for breakfast duty. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already switched the heaters on and put out the tablecloths,\u201d Mona tells him as he drains the last of his coffee. \u201cCould you just go and put the mugs and cutlery out? I think we\u2019ve only got two tables today.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Dan says, giving Louise\u2019s arm a small squeeze of gratitude for the breakfast and coffee; she waves a batter-y whisk at him in a shooing motion, but she\u2019s smiling. . </p><!-- more --><p>Once he\u2019s armed with a basket of silverware and crockery from the cupboard, Dan heads for the balcony and stops short, noticing that for the first time, someone is already sat out there. Stunned, Dan just stares through the glass at Mr Novokoric, who is transfixed on the blue-shadowed mountains in the distance. Reluctantly, Dan pushes through the doors, bracing himself for the cold, both from the frigid mountain air, and the attitude of his least favourite guest. </p><p>The door slams shut behind him, making Mr Novokoric turn. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he says, like an automatic greeting. For some reason - probably the cold and the pre-caffeine kick-in - Dan finds himself a little tongue-tied. He nods at the other man, struggling to hold onto the basket in his hands. </p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he manages, eyes sticking to the light wind-stung flush on Mr Novokoric\u2019s high cheeks. </p><p>Mr Novokoric turns back to the view then, and Dan begins setting out the mugs, knives, forks, spoons and glasses on the tables. He assumes that Mr Novokoric must be one of the two tables having breakfast today, which makes sense, as the Stevens\u2019 left yesterday evening. They\u2019d hugged Dan tightly, promising to return before the year was out. It had, in a way, been rather sad to see them disappearing with Kaspar back down the mountain in the swinging cable car. Mostly Dan is glad that he no longer has to avert his eyes as they walk through the hotel with their omnipresent robes dangerously loose, but they were a parental sort of couple, and he thinks they might genuinely miss him too. Fumbling only slightly, Dan begins to place a setting out in front of Mr Novokoric. As he sets the mug down, Mr Novokoric reaches for it, and frowns as he tilts it towards him. </p><p>\u201cCan I get some coffee?\u201d </p><p>Dan pauses, flipping the question over in his mind. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>One of those jet black eyebrows springs upwards. \u201cYes. Is that permitted?\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, blushing, and hating himself for it. He takes the mug and scampers off to the kitchen, managing to garble some request to Louise. For some reason his flustered state is amusing to her, and she pretends for a minute or two to have no clue what he\u2019s asking - not helpful - but eventually he gets a mug of filter coffee out of her. He watches, curious, as she automatically adds soya milk and two heaped teaspoons of sugar. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lactose intolerant,\u201d she says, by way of explanation. \u201cAnd has a hell of a sweet tooth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say who it\u2019s for,\u201d Dan says, perplexed, as he takes the mug from her. </p><p>\u201cWho else around here would have you blushing and stammering like a nun at a brothel?\u201d </p><p>Dan chooses not to respond to this, mostly because he can\u2019t summon anything except a mortified spluttering sound. He takes the mug of coffee back out to Mr Novokoric, cheeks still a warm pink. It\u2019s just the wind flush though, at this point. Probably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you like anything else, Sir?\u201d Dan asks politely. \u201cThe chef is still cooking breakfast, but I could perhaps get you some cereal or yoghurt-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Mr Novokoric says sniffily, and Dan replays what Louise just said to him. </p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, you don\u2019t have dairy,\u201d Dan says, shaking his head. Mr Novokoric turns his head sharply back to Dan, frowning. \u201cI could get you some fresh fruit? Or-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mr Novokoric says again, though his voice is less hostile now. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, not hungry.\u201d He pauses, mouth twitching. \u201c&hellip;Thanks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Dan dithers, uncomfortably aware he now has a wedge of time to kill before the other guests emerge, and no other place to be. \u201cSo&hellip; um, why are you out here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p><p>Dan shuts his eyes, cursing silently. \u201cSorry, I just meant- you\u2019re normally out on the mountain at this time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mr Novokoric sips his drink, looking away. </p><p>\u201cDid you not fancy braving the snow today?\u201d</p><p>Dan has absolutely no idea why he\u2019s suddenly so intent on keeping this hellish conversation going, given that Mr Novokoric looks like he\u2019d rather pour the coffee over his own head than continue it. Somehow it would be worse to turn away from him though, to stand off to the side and wait for more guests to turn up, arms folded, pretending not to stare as that blank, unhappy glare washed away any animation on Mr Novokoric\u2019s sharp, striking features. So, Dan forces himself to stay rooted to the spot, letting Mr Novokoric\u2019s icy look of contemptuous horror at Dan\u2019s insistence on smalltalk slice through him like he\u2019s snow beneath Mr Novokoric\u2019s boot. </p><p>\u201cMy ski broke,\u201d he says, unexpectedly. </p><p>A flashback hits Dan as abruptly as the cherry-red skis hit the wall of the lobby the day before yesterday. \u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cIs there- it can\u2019t be fixed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt I\u2019m going to find someone proficient at winter sports equipment repair at the top of this fucking mountain, do you?\u201d </p><p>The curse word is shocking, and it takes Dan a moment to let it go. Phil\u2019s accent is slightly Northern, but his diction and use of language is impeccable, presumably due to all the hobnobbing and schmoozing he has to do, as a \u2018Royal\u2019. Hearing him swear is what he imagines it would be like hearing the Queen swear. In a sense, it\u2019s rather titillating - another reason Dan should abandon this conversation for good. Luckily, at that moment, the balcony door opens, and Mona ushers the two Bryce sisters through, leading them to the other laid table. </p><p>Relieved to see the chattering, marginally irritating middle-aged women for once, Dan excuses himself from Mr Novokoric, who barely bats an eye, and goes to take their breakfast order. </p><p>*</p><p>In a moment of downtime, while the evening film screening is going on, Dan goes hunting for two cherry-red skis, which he finds near the hotel entrance, leant against the wall. He takes hold of the left one, and examines it closely. Just as Mr Novokoric said, it has a broken appendage - the strap which secures the boot to the ski has come loose.\u00a0The straps are peculiar to Dan, having no backs to them, but Dan can see where the front part used to fix to the ski itself even so. By comparing it with the other ski, Dan thinks it\u2019s mendable. All too aware that he\u2019s got nothing better to do for the next few hours, Dan takes the ski over to the desk and lays it over his lap as he sits down to take a closer look.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s just because he\u2019s bored, he tells himself as he hunts for tools in Mona\u2019s office, and discovers a tiny screwdriver and screws in one of the cleaning cupboards, along with a pot of superglue. The film is a long one tonight - <i>The Italian Job</i> - so for a few hours Dan is able to work in complete solitude, listening to a faint Muse song through one headphone, and not stopping until the ski is fixed. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still holding a grudge against the poor man,\u201d Louise says, scrubbing at a pot with a scourer. Dan, sat up on one of the kitchen counters sipping hot chocolate, rolls his eyes. \u201cHe apologised for being rude, didn\u2019t he?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSome apology,\u201d Dan counters. Since two days ago in the gym, Dan has convinced himself that Mr Novokoric\u2019s words had been largely to smooth things over with the staff member he\u2019d pissed off, considering that it would be pretty awkward seeing him around the place 24-7 if they were not on speaking terms. In no way, Dan has decided, did Mr Novokoric actually mean what he said. \u201cJust because he\u2019s eloquent doesn\u2019t make him sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh-er,\u201d Louise says, flicking washing up water at him. He squeaks, shielding his hot chocolate. \u201cSounds like he got under your skin.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s next sip is too hot, and he burns his tongue. </p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Louise says, tipping out the saucepan and laying it out to dry. She starts untying her apron, wearily. \u201cThere\u2019s three hours until I\u2019ve got to start on dinner, so I think I\u2019ll have a little lie down. Can you hold the fort for a bit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Dan looks through the serving hatch into the empty mezzanine lounge. The Bryce sisters are the only guests staying here at the moment, though another couple are due to check in tonight. Right now, he\u2019s pretty sure the Bryce sisters - an excitable, childlike pair of forty-something women on what they refer to as a \u2018girls getaway\u2019 - are in the jacuzzi. If they were anywhere indoors, Dan is certain he\u2019d be able to hear their shrieks of laughter no matter which room they were in. \u201cSure, yeah. No worries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf you need me, I\u2019m in room three,\u201d Louise says, already on her way to the kitchen door. \u201cBut Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need me,\u201d she warns, and then exits the room. </p><p>*</p><p>About half an hour later, Dan is in the same position atop the kitchen counter, playing Crossy Road on his phone and polishing off a flapjack from the batch Louise made this morning. Suddenly, a noise like a throat clearing jolts him, and his animated emo goose is hit by a truck. He lowers the phone, head lifting, to see Mr Novokoric at the serving hatch, that cool assessing gaze chilling the temperature of the kitchen by at least two degrees. Dan swallows some flapjack the wrong way, and has to hide a mild choking fit.</p><p>In Mr Novokoric\u2019s hand is a mug. \u201cIs Louise here?\u201d he asks. </p><p>Dan shakes his head, swallowing his own tonsils to cleat the flapjack from his airway. His eyes water, but he gets down from the counter one gangly leg at a time. \u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he croaks. He wipes his hands of flapjack crumbs on a nearby tea-towel. \u201cShe\u2019s napping. Can I help?\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric appears troubled by this news, and takes a moment to reply, as if he\u2019s mulling something over. Eventually, whatever wins out, and he asks, \u201cany chance of some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHave you run out of the instant packets in your room? I can find some in the stock cupboard-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-o,\u201d Mr Novokoric interrupts, as if he\u2019s speaking with a half-wit. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for instant coffee. Louise usually makes me a macchiato, if I ask her.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s blood runs cold, and he turns to eye the bulky coffee machine sat menacingly on the far counter. \u201cRight,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cOf course she does.\u201d</p><p>Given his past failures to please Mr Novokoric thus far, he doesn\u2019t feel he can say \u2018oh, I\u2019m not actually sure how to work this machine, maybe it would be best to wait for Louise to wake up\u2019. So instead, Dan takes the mug, and steps warily over to the machine to attempt something called a \u2018macchiato\u2019. </p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiato,\u201d Mr Novokoric clarifies, at which Dan turns to blink at him, utterly bemused. </p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d he says, for some wild reason. \u201cNo problem.\u201d </p><p>As he surveys the contraption before him, Dan can feel eyes boring into the back of him - pure judgement coated in an intense, deep blue. He tries his best to ignore the prickle of skin this stare creates, and sets about mimicking what he can remember from watching Louise work the machine. He pours milk into one of the chrome jugs, shoves the spout into it and turns a dial. Droplets of milk immediately fly everywhere, and a monstrous hissing sound emerges from the beast. He quickly turns the dial back, abandoning that for now, and focuses on unfixing one of the espresso-filter-things from its lock. This takes a good two minutes of tugging and silently begging, during which time the milk in the jug seems to develop an appetising skin on top. At last, Dan pulls the thing free, dumps the used granules out and tamps some coffee into it, though he has no idea how much, and probably over-fills it. He does manage to fix it back in place, and over several agonising minutes the espresso drips through into the mug. When he can\u2019t stand the waiting any longer, knowing damn well he\u2019s being scrutinised, Dan takes the mug out, pours a dash of lukewarm milk into it from the jug, and takes it over to the hatch. </p><p>It looks&hellip;. pretty vile. But he has to hand Mr Novokoric something. </p><p>\u201cUh, here we go. One macchiato.\u201d </p><p>He realises in the next moment that he forgot to add any caramel. Not that he\u2019d have any idea where to procure it from in this kitchen. Mr Novokoric looks down at the coffee in Dan\u2019s hand, sends him a look of something like pity, and makes no move to take it. </p><p>\u201cAaand suddenly I can think of nothing better than instant coffee,\u201d he says, nose wrinkling. </p><p>He turns away, heading back towards the stairs, leaving Dan with an undrinkable mug of coffee, and a sudden urge to hurl himself off the side of the mountain. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDan, I need a word,\u201d Mona says, beckoning him into the small office at the back of reception. </p><p>It\u2019s early evening, and the neither the Bryce sisters nor the Lautrecs - a quiet French gay couple that arrived an hour or so ago - are interested in an evening film, so there\u2019s fuck all to do. Instantly upon hearing Mona\u2019s words, fear strikes Dan in the chest; he follows Mona into her office, heart in his throat.\u00a0</p><p>She gestures for him to sit on one of the wicker chairs in front of her desk, so he does, knee jiggling with nerves.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry Mona,\u201d Dan blurts before she\u2019s even sat down.\u00a0\u201cThe job description didn\u2019t say anything about being barista trained. If you received a complaint-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop you there, Dan,\u201d Mona says, loudly and shrilly.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are apologising for, but it\u2019s probably best if I never find out, hm?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Gulping down the relief that surges forth, Dan nods emphatically, and relaxes back into the chair. Mona looks a little more polished than usual today, he notes. She has a high-collared white blouse on, which elongates her neck, and a pearl-encrusted scrunchie securing her usual bun. Dan has begun to notice that Mona dresses a bit smarter on the days the mail is delivered, or when new guests arrive, or leave. In other words, any time Kaspar is expected to be around. Kaspar dropped off the Lautrecs earlier, so today is no exception.</p><p>Right now she sits at the small desk, hands clasped, and clears her throat. Her cheeks are tinged with rosy pink, probably from Kaspar\u2019s brief visit earlier. The idea of no-nonsense Mona having a teeny crush creates a warm glow in Dan\u2019s chest, and he smiles. \u201cI called you in here because I have some unfortunate news,\u201d Mona says. Dan\u2019s smile quickly vanishes. \u201cI\u2019ve been called away this weekend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, already confused. \u201cIs everything-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a personal matter,\u201d Mona tells him, firmly ending his inquiry before it\u2019s begun. \u201cBut the timing is poor, what with you having just started, and with it being Louise\u2019s weekend off.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments, the implications of this don\u2019t quite settle in. Then, Dan stops being quite so dim. \u201cWait, do you mean I\u2019d be here <i>alone</i>?\u201d </p><p>Mona avoids his eye, neatening some papers on her desk. \u201cI understand that it might seem rather daunting.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMona, I\u2019m nowhere near qualified to run this place on my own,\u201d Dan says in a rush, blood starting to pound loudly in his ears. </p><p>Just the thought of such responsibility is crushing; what if he forgot to serve lunch? What if he overslept and nobody was available for the guests? He\u2019s basically a glorified assistant here, he can\u2019t be expected to handle <i>real</i> decisions. </p><p>\u201cDan, it\u2019s just for a couple of days,\u201d Mona says; there\u2019s a pleading tone to her voice that Dan expects doesn\u2019t rear its head very often. \u201cJust until Louise returns on Sunday night. Kaspar can make it up here in a matter of hours if there\u2019s an emergency. But you won\u2019t need him. There\u2019s only one couple booked in to stay, and I doubt they\u2019ll be very high maintenance.\u201d </p><p>One couple and a narcissistic rich twat-face whose snobbery extends right down to his coffee order, Dan thinks, but begrudgingly admits to himself that Mr Novokoric is unlikely to be very demanding either. The man seems to keep mostly to himself unless he truly can\u2019t help it. Dan folds his arms across his chest, lip caught between his teeth. He can\u2019t really refuse, particularly as he suspects that Mona is desperate enough to get down onto her stocking-covered knees and beg him. Perhaps he <i>could</i> manage to keep the place afloat without any major screw-ups. But the stress of it all might kill him, even so. </p><p>\u201cI know this is completely unfair of me,\u201d Mona tells him, and reaches up to tug the pearl scrunchie out of her bun. The hair spills out, revealing a shoulder-length bob; the sight is so shocking that Dan feels his fingers twitching at his sides, as if he wants to scoop up the loose locks and pull them back into position. Mona runs both hands through the mess of hair, eyes fluttering shut. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask unless it were really important. Normally I\u2019d rather drop dead than leave this place in someone else\u2019s hands, even for a day or so, especially without Louise to help. But I just can\u2019t see another option. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s my grandmother, you see. She\u2019s ninety-four, and on her last legs-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan says quickly. He can\u2019t bear to see her like this; he doubts that even Louise, who\u2019s worked here for four years, has seen Mona with her hair down. Dan\u2019s never even seen Mona in plain clothes. She probably sleeps in her crisp skirt-suits. \u201cI can handle things,\u201d Dan assures her, hoping he has something akin to conviction in his tone, given that he\u2019s speaking out of his ass. \u201cLike you said, it\u2019s just a weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a phone call away,\u201d Mona promises, eyes reopening in order to look at Dan like he\u2019s Christ arisen. \u201cThank you, Dan. I\u2019ll remember this.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Mr Novokoric is sat at a table on the balcony again, just as Dan is about to set up for breakfast. He already has a coffee in front of him today, Dan notes, cheeks burning when he remembers yesterday\u2019s fiasco. Luckily it\u2019s windy again this morning, so he can blame the pink colour of his skin on that, if asked. </p><p>He mutters a \u201cgood morning\u201d and starts setting Mr Novokoric\u2019s table, asking him politely to lift his drink so that he can lay a tablecloth down. Dan can feel that hard, ultramarine stare as he sets out a knife and fork he knows will remain untouched - the man seems to live on coffee alone - and tries to resist the urge to spew some garbled apology for yesterday\u2019s macchiato fiasco. </p><p>Before he can get it out however, Mr Novokoric speaks. \u201cSo, I asked Mona to order me a new phone, and some new skis.\u201d </p><p>The last word makes Dan drop a spoon. He bends down to get it, but he\u2019s not quick enough. Mr Novokoric hands it back to him, some curious sparkle hiding beneath his usual stern expression. </p><p>\u201cMore skis,\u201d Dan echoes, trying not to let his expression droop. So, it seems he\u2019s spent a good three hours of his life fixing a ski that will shortly be replaced. So much for being a good samaritan. \u201cRight. Are you asking me if they\u2019ve arrived? I can check, but I don\u2019t think Kaspar has brought them up yet-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangest thing, though,\u201d Mr Novokoric interrupts, as though Dan hadn\u2019t been in the middle of a sentence. \u201cI went to throw my old skis away, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with them. The strap\u2019s been mended.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Dan says, turning back to his basket for a new spoon. He sets it carefully on the table, trying to remain composed. \u201cWeird.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you fix it?\u201d </p><p>Pinned in place by Mr Novokoric\u2019s gaze, Dan feels his face turning from pink to red. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to overstep. I had no idea you\u2019d already ordered more-\u201d</p><p>He breaks off, wary of the strange expression being aimed at him. Mr Novokoric\u2019s eyes have softened, and there\u2019s something close to a smile threatening to break forth. The idea of him actually smiling is enough to fluster Dan into taking a hasty step backwards. The man is uncomfortably pretty as it is, which is confusing enough considering he\u2019s such an asshole. Dan doesn\u2019t know if he could handle a dazzling grin on top of that. </p><p>\u201cThat was\u2026 unexpected,\u201d Mr Novokoric says slowly. His smile still hasn\u2019t quite broken through, but his face has lost the hardness Dan is used to seeing. Without the usual frown lines and turned down corners of his mouth, he could even be beautiful. \u201cThank you. Of course, your repair is unneeded now, but I appreciate the gesture.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, um, no worries,\u201d Dan says, wondering how rude it would be to just run away. \u201cI had a spare minute, so\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot many people would have the initiative, let alone the intellect to do that,\u201d he says, draining the last of his coffee. He hold the mug out for Dan to take. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d </p><p>Feeling about three inches tall now, Dan just gives him a tight smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, and takes the mug. \u201cAnother coffee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Mr Novokoric answers, arching an eyebrow. \u201cWho\u2019s making it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cL-Louise,\u201d Dan says, cheeks hot again. </p><p>\u201cThen yes, please,\u201d he says, turning back to the view in front of him. </p><p>\u201cRight away, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan mutters, glad of the eventual opening to escape. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>Ugh, not so fast, it seems. \u201cYes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCall me Phil, if you like.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cLou, I have an urgent problem,\u201d Dan says, slamming into the kitchen. </p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up from the eggs she\u2019s scrambling. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take me a few hours to sort your hair out for you, Dan. I don\u2019t have time right now, I\u2019ve got to get breakfast out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I need you to teach me how to work the coffee machine,\u201d Dan says, smoothing his hair down self-consciously. </p><p>Louise looks up sharply, a smirk spreading over her mouth. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here on my own all weekend. I need to know how to make fancy coffees for\u2026 guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiatos?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll the different kinds!\u201d </p><p>Louise laughs in her long, pretty trill, and nods. \u201cAfter breakfast,\u201d she says. \u201cMeet me here, I\u2019ll give you a lesson.\u201d </p><p>Dan grins at her, then plucks a raspberry from a bowl nearby. \u201cOh, and Phil wants another cup when you have a sec.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Louise mutters, going back to the eggs. \u201cI\u2019ll get that for <i>Phil</i>.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan pretends not to hear the knowing smile hidden in her voice as he exits the kitchen. He jogs back outside then, just in time to usher the Lautrecs to their table.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>As it turns out, the coffee machine is going to take more than one lesson to master. Not because it\u2019s especially complicated - more because Dan is utterly inept. </p><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d Louise shrieks as Dan turns the wrong knob, and spurts actual boiling steam from the nozzle. Luckily, they both somehow manage to avoid getting scalded. \u201cMy God, Daniel, have you never watched the barista as they make your latte before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really very attentive,\u201d Dan says, sheepishly.\u00a0</p><p>He looks over the herd of coffees he\u2019s made over the last hour, all huddled together on the counter. The argument could probably be made that his most recent is better than the initial attempts, but that would hardly be a compliment. He imagines each of the milky, sludge-coloured concoctions is silently whispering \u2018<i>kill me, please</i>\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try a macchiato again.\u201d He\u2019s nothing if not determined.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be under the impression that I have nothing better to do than dodge you covering me in coffee granules,\u201d Louise says, wiping the nozzle clean. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get lunch going, so maybe we can pick this up tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is Friday,\u201d Dan protests. \u201cThat\u2019s the day you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018til the evening,\u201d Louise says. \u201cThere\u2019s enough time to squeeze in another lesson before that, God help me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust one more,\u201d Dan begs, giving her his most puppy-dog expression. \u201cJust show me the macchiato again. Please.\u201d</p><p>She sighs dramatically, sort of groaning. \u201cAlright, alright. Get the caramel syrup then.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not until Dan has the syrup in his hands that he realises Louise is insinuating that these macchiatos are for Phil. She aims a knowing smile at him, and Dan just ignores her, cheeks pink as he pours caramel into the mug. He\u2019s frothing milk, Louise shrieking instructions in his ear - <i>\u201ctilt the jug!\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re spraying it everywhere, push the nozzle down more!\u201d, \u201cnot that far, Christ!\u201d</i> - when he senses someone watching him. Mortified at the idea his foibles might be witnessed, Dan drops the jug and hot, not-so-frothy milk gushes everywhere, soaking his and Louise\u2019s shoes, and a lot of the kitchen floor. </p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m about to write you off as a lost cause!\u201d Louise shouts, tearing her hat off her head and storming to the sink to find a cloth. \u201cIf these shoes are ruined you\u2019re buying me more.\u201d</p><p>Dan barely hears her; he\u2019s too busy meeting the curious stare aimed at him. Phil Novokoric is sat at one of the indoor tables in the mezzanine, chin in his hand, watching Dan through the serving hatch. For some reason, Dan lifts his hand in a semblance of a wave; this seems to amuse Phil greatly, though he doesn\u2019t wave back. Instead, a small, barely-there smile graces his lips, presumably for himself, and then he gets up, and walks towards the stairs to the lobby.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Louise says, chucking a damp cloth at Dan. \u201cClean this up, then get the hell out of my kitchen. Coffee class resumes tomorrow.\u201d</p><p><b>(Chapter Five coming next Friday!)</b></p>",

Stunned, Dan just stares through the glass at Mr Novokoric, who is transfixed on the blue-shadowed mountains in the distance. Reluctantly, Dan pushes through the doors, bracing himself for the cold, both from the frigid mountain air, and the attitude of his least favourite guest. </p><p>The door slams shut behind him, making Mr Novokoric turn. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he says, like an automatic greeting. For some reason - probably the cold and the pre-caffeine kick-in - Dan finds himself a little tongue-tied. He nods at the other man, struggling to hold onto the basket in his hands. </p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he manages, eyes sticking to the light wind-stung flush on Mr Novokoric\u2019s high cheeks. </p><p>Mr Novokoric turns back to the view then, and Dan begins setting out the mugs, knives, forks, spoons and glasses on the tables. He assumes that Mr Novokoric must be one of the two tables having breakfast today, which makes sense, as the Stevens\u2019 left yesterday evening. They\u2019d hugged Dan tightly, promising to return before the year was out. It had, in a way, been rather sad to see them disappearing with Kaspar back down the mountain in the swinging cable car. Mostly Dan is glad that he no longer has to avert his eyes as they walk through the hotel with their omnipresent robes dangerously loose, but they were a parental sort of couple, and he thinks they might genuinely miss him too. Fumbling only slightly, Dan begins to place a setting out in front of Mr Novokoric. As he sets the mug down, Mr Novokoric reaches for it, and frowns as he tilts it towards him. </p><p>\u201cCan I get some coffee?\u201d </p><p>Dan pauses, flipping the question over in his mind. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>One of those jet black eyebrows springs upwards. \u201cYes. Is that permitted?\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, blushing, and hating himself for it. He takes the mug and scampers off to the kitchen, managing to garble some request to Louise. For some reason his flustered state is amusing to her, and she pretends for a minute or two to have no clue what he\u2019s asking - not helpful - but eventually he gets a mug of filter coffee out of her. He watches, curious, as she automatically adds soya milk and two heaped teaspoons of sugar. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lactose intolerant,\u201d she says, by way of explanation. \u201cAnd has a hell of a sweet tooth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say who it\u2019s for,\u201d Dan says, perplexed, as he takes the mug from her. </p><p>\u201cWho else around here would have you blushing and stammering like a nun at a brothel?\u201d </p><p>Dan chooses not to respond to this, mostly because he can\u2019t summon anything except a mortified spluttering sound. He takes the mug of coffee back out to Mr Novokoric, cheeks still a warm pink. It\u2019s just the wind flush though, at this point. Probably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you like anything else, Sir?\u201d Dan asks politely. \u201cThe chef is still cooking breakfast, but I could perhaps get you some cereal or yoghurt-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Mr Novokoric says sniffily, and Dan replays what Louise just said to him. </p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, you don\u2019t have dairy,\u201d Dan says, shaking his head. Mr Novokoric turns his head sharply back to Dan, frowning. \u201cI could get you some fresh fruit? Or-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mr Novokoric says again, though his voice is less hostile now. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, not hungry.\u201d He pauses, mouth twitching. \u201c\u2026Thanks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Dan dithers, uncomfortably aware he now has a wedge of time to kill before the other guests emerge, and no other place to be. \u201cSo\u2026 um, why are you out here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p><p>Dan shuts his eyes, cursing silently. \u201cSorry, I just meant- you\u2019re normally out on the mountain at this time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mr Novokoric sips his drink, looking away. </p><p>\u201cDid you not fancy braving the snow today?\u201d</p><p>Dan has absolutely no idea why he\u2019s suddenly so intent on keeping this hellish conversation going, given that Mr Novokoric looks like he\u2019d rather pour the coffee over his own head than continue it. Somehow it would be worse to turn away from him though, to stand off to the side and wait for more guests to turn up, arms folded, pretending not to stare as that blank, unhappy glare washed away any animation on Mr Novokoric\u2019s sharp, striking features. So, Dan forces himself to stay rooted to the spot, letting Mr Novokoric\u2019s icy look of contemptuous horror at Dan\u2019s insistence on smalltalk slice through him like he\u2019s snow beneath Mr Novokoric\u2019s boot. </p><p>\u201cMy ski broke,\u201d he says, unexpectedly. </p><p>A flashback hits Dan as abruptly as the cherry-red skis hit the wall of the lobby the day before yesterday. \u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cIs there- it can\u2019t be fixed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt I\u2019m going to find someone proficient at winter sports equipment repair at the top of this fucking mountain, do you?\u201d </p><p>The curse word is shocking, and it takes Dan a moment to let it go. Phil\u2019s accent is slightly Northern, but his diction and use of language is impeccable, presumably due to all the hobnobbing and schmoozing he has to do, as a \u2018Royal\u2019. Hearing him swear is what he imagines it would be like hearing the Queen swear. In a sense, it\u2019s rather titillating - another reason Dan should abandon this conversation for good. Luckily, at that moment, the balcony door opens, and Mona ushers the two Bryce sisters through, leading them to the other laid table. </p><p>Relieved to see the chattering, marginally irritating middle-aged women for once, Dan excuses himself from Mr Novokoric, who barely bats an eye, and goes to take their breakfast order. </p><p>*</p><p>In a moment of downtime, while the evening film screening is going on, Dan goes hunting for two cherry-red skis, which he finds near the hotel entrance, leant against the wall. He takes hold of the left one, and examines it closely. Just as Mr Novokoric said, it has a broken appendage - the strap which secures the boot to the ski has come loose.\u00a0The straps are peculiar to Dan, having no backs to them, but Dan can see where the front part used to fix to the ski itself even so. By comparing it with the other ski, Dan thinks it\u2019s mendable. All too aware that he\u2019s got nothing better to do for the next few hours, Dan takes the ski over to the desk and lays it over his lap as he sits down to take a closer look.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s just because he\u2019s bored, he tells himself as he hunts for tools in Mona\u2019s office, and discovers a tiny screwdriver and screws in one of the cleaning cupboards, along with a pot of superglue. The film is a long one tonight - <i>The Italian Job</i> - so for a few hours Dan is able to work in complete solitude, listening to a faint Muse song through one headphone, and not stopping until the ski is fixed. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still holding a grudge against the poor man,\u201d Louise says, scrubbing at a pot with a scourer. Dan, sat up on one of the kitchen counters sipping hot chocolate, rolls his eyes. \u201cHe apologised for being rude, didn\u2019t he?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSome apology,\u201d Dan counters. Since two days ago in the gym, Dan has convinced himself that Mr Novokoric\u2019s words had been largely to smooth things over with the staff member he\u2019d pissed off, considering that it would be pretty awkward seeing him around the place 24-7 if they were not on speaking terms. In no way, Dan has decided, did Mr Novokoric actually mean what he said. \u201cJust because he\u2019s eloquent doesn\u2019t make him sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh-er,\u201d Louise says, flicking washing up water at him. He squeaks, shielding his hot chocolate. \u201cSounds like he got under your skin.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s next sip is too hot, and he burns his tongue. </p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Louise says, tipping out the saucepan and laying it out to dry. She starts untying her apron, wearily. \u201cThere\u2019s three hours until I\u2019ve got to start on dinner, so I think I\u2019ll have a little lie down. Can you hold the fort for a bit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Dan looks through the serving hatch into the empty mezzanine lounge. The Bryce sisters are the only guests staying here at the moment, though another couple are due to check in tonight. Right now, he\u2019s pretty sure the Bryce sisters - an excitable, childlike pair of forty-something women on what they refer to as a \u2018girls getaway\u2019 - are in the jacuzzi. If they were anywhere indoors, Dan is certain he\u2019d be able to hear their shrieks of laughter no matter which room they were in. \u201cSure, yeah. No worries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf you need me, I\u2019m in room three,\u201d Louise says, already on her way to the kitchen door. \u201cBut Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need me,\u201d she warns, and then exits the room. </p><p>*</p><p>About half an hour later, Dan is in the same position atop the kitchen counter, playing Crossy Road on his phone and polishing off a flapjack from the batch Louise made this morning. Suddenly, a noise like a throat clearing jolts him, and his animated emo goose is hit by a truck. He lowers the phone, head lifting, to see Mr Novokoric at the serving hatch, that cool assessing gaze chilling the temperature of the kitchen by at least two degrees. Dan swallows some flapjack the wrong way, and has to hide a mild choking fit.</p><p>In Mr Novokoric\u2019s hand is a mug. \u201cIs Louise here?\u201d he asks. </p><p>Dan shakes his head, swallowing his own tonsils to cleat the flapjack from his airway. His eyes water, but he gets down from the counter one gangly leg at a time. \u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he croaks. He wipes his hands of flapjack crumbs on a nearby tea-towel. \u201cShe\u2019s napping. Can I help?\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric appears troubled by this news, and takes a moment to reply, as if he\u2019s mulling something over. Eventually, whatever wins out, and he asks, \u201cany chance of some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHave you run out of the instant packets in your room? I can find some in the stock cupboard-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-o,\u201d Mr Novokoric interrupts, as if he\u2019s speaking with a half-wit. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for instant coffee. Louise usually makes me a macchiato, if I ask her.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s blood runs cold, and he turns to eye the bulky coffee machine sat menacingly on the far counter. \u201cRight,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cOf course she does.\u201d</p><p>Given his past failures to please Mr Novokoric thus far, he doesn\u2019t feel he can say \u2018oh, I\u2019m not actually sure how to work this machine, maybe it would be best to wait for Louise to wake up\u2019. So instead, Dan takes the mug, and steps warily over to the machine to attempt something called a \u2018macchiato\u2019. </p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiato,\u201d Mr Novokoric clarifies, at which Dan turns to blink at him, utterly bemused. </p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d he says, for some wild reason. \u201cNo problem.\u201d </p><p>As he surveys the contraption before him, Dan can feel eyes boring into the back of him - pure judgement coated in an intense, deep blue. He tries his best to ignore the prickle of skin this stare creates, and sets about mimicking what he can remember from watching Louise work the machine. He pours milk into one of the chrome jugs, shoves the spout into it and turns a dial. Droplets of milk immediately fly everywhere, and a monstrous hissing sound emerges from the beast. He quickly turns the dial back, abandoning that for now, and focuses on unfixing one of the espresso-filter-things from its lock. This takes a good two minutes of tugging and silently begging, during which time the milk in the jug seems to develop an appetising skin on top. At last, Dan pulls the thing free, dumps the used granules out and tamps some coffee into it, though he has no idea how much, and probably over-fills it. He does manage to fix it back in place, and over several agonising minutes the espresso drips through into the mug. When he can\u2019t stand the waiting any longer, knowing damn well he\u2019s being scrutinised, Dan takes the mug out, pours a dash of lukewarm milk into it from the jug, and takes it over to the hatch. </p><p>It looks\u2026. pretty vile. But he has to hand Mr Novokoric something. </p><p>\u201cUh, here we go. One macchiato.\u201d </p><p>He realises in the next moment that he forgot to add any caramel. Not that he\u2019d have any idea where to procure it from in this kitchen. Mr Novokoric looks down at the coffee in Dan\u2019s hand, sends him a look of something like pity, and makes no move to take it. </p><p>\u201cAaand suddenly I can think of nothing better than instant coffee,\u201d he says, nose wrinkling. </p><p>He turns away, heading back towards the stairs, leaving Dan with an undrinkable mug of coffee, and a sudden urge to hurl himself off the side of the mountain. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDan, I need a word,\u201d Mona says, beckoning him into the small office at the back of reception. </p><p>It\u2019s early evening, and the neither the Bryce sisters nor the Lautrecs - a quiet French gay couple that arrived an hour or so ago - are interested in an evening film, so there\u2019s fuck all to do. Instantly upon hearing Mona\u2019s words, fear strikes Dan in the chest; he follows Mona into her office, heart in his throat.\u00a0</p><p>She gestures for him to sit on one of the wicker chairs in front of her desk, so he does, knee jiggling with nerves.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry Mona,\u201d Dan blurts before she\u2019s even sat down.\u00a0\u201cThe job description didn\u2019t say anything about being barista trained. If you received a complaint-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop you there, Dan,\u201d Mona says, loudly and shrilly.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are apologising for, but it\u2019s probably best if I never find out, hm?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Gulping down the relief that surges forth, Dan nods emphatically, and relaxes back into the chair. Mona looks a little more polished than usual today, he notes. She has a high-collared white blouse on, which elongates her neck, and a pearl-encrusted scrunchie securing her usual bun. Dan has begun to notice that Mona dresses a bit smarter on the days the mail is delivered, or when new guests arrive, or leave. In other words, any time Kaspar is expected to be around. Kaspar dropped off the Lautrecs earlier, so today is no exception.</p><p>Right now she sits at the small desk, hands clasped, and clears her throat. Her cheeks are tinged with rosy pink, probably from Kaspar\u2019s brief visit earlier. The idea of no-nonsense Mona having a teeny crush creates a warm glow in Dan\u2019s chest, and he smiles. \u201cI called you in here because I have some unfortunate news,\u201d Mona says. Dan\u2019s smile quickly vanishes. \u201cI\u2019ve been called away this weekend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, already confused. \u201cIs everything-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a personal matter,\u201d Mona tells him, firmly ending his inquiry before it\u2019s begun. \u201cBut the timing is poor, what with you having just started, and with it being Louise\u2019s weekend off.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments, the implications of this don\u2019t quite settle in. Then, Dan stops being quite so dim. \u201cWait, do you mean I\u2019d be here <i>alone</i>?\u201d </p><p>Mona avoids his eye, neatening some papers on her desk. \u201cI understand that it might seem rather daunting.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMona, I\u2019m nowhere near qualified to run this place on my own,\u201d Dan says in a rush, blood starting to pound loudly in his ears. </p><p>Just the thought of such responsibility is crushing; what if he forgot to serve lunch? What if he overslept and nobody was available for the guests? He\u2019s basically a glorified assistant here, he can\u2019t be expected to handle <i>real</i> decisions. </p><p>\u201cDan, it\u2019s just for a couple of days,\u201d Mona says; there\u2019s a pleading tone to her voice that Dan expects doesn\u2019t rear its head very often. \u201cJust until Louise returns on Sunday night. Kaspar can make it up here in a matter of hours if there\u2019s an emergency. But you won\u2019t need him. There\u2019s only one couple booked in to stay, and I doubt they\u2019ll be very high maintenance.\u201d </p><p>One couple and a narcissistic rich twat-face whose snobbery extends right down to his coffee order, Dan thinks, but begrudgingly admits to himself that Mr Novokoric is unlikely to be very demanding either. The man seems to keep mostly to himself unless he truly can\u2019t help it. Dan folds his arms across his chest, lip caught between his teeth. He can\u2019t really refuse, particularly as he suspects that Mona is desperate enough to get down onto her stocking-covered knees and beg him. Perhaps he <i>could</i> manage to keep the place afloat without any major screw-ups. But the stress of it all might kill him, even so. </p><p>\u201cI know this is completely unfair of me,\u201d Mona tells him, and reaches up to tug the pearl scrunchie out of her bun. The hair spills out, revealing a shoulder-length bob; the sight is so shocking that Dan feels his fingers twitching at his sides, as if he wants to scoop up the loose locks and pull them back into position. Mona runs both hands through the mess of hair, eyes fluttering shut. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask unless it were really important. Normally I\u2019d rather drop dead than leave this place in someone else\u2019s hands, even for a day or so, especially without Louise to help. But I just can\u2019t see another option. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s my grandmother, you see. She\u2019s ninety-four, and on her last legs-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan says quickly. He can\u2019t bear to see her like this; he doubts that even Louise, who\u2019s worked here for four years, has seen Mona with her hair down. Dan\u2019s never even seen Mona in plain clothes. She probably sleeps in her crisp skirt-suits. \u201cI can handle things,\u201d Dan assures her, hoping he has something akin to conviction in his tone, given that he\u2019s speaking out of his ass. \u201cLike you said, it\u2019s just a weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a phone call away,\u201d Mona promises, eyes reopening in order to look at Dan like he\u2019s Christ arisen. \u201cThank you, Dan. I\u2019ll remember this.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Mr Novokoric is sat at a table on the balcony again, just as Dan is about to set up for breakfast. He already has a coffee in front of him today, Dan notes, cheeks burning when he remembers yesterday\u2019s fiasco. Luckily it\u2019s windy again this morning, so he can blame the pink colour of his skin on that, if asked. </p><p>He mutters a \u201cgood morning\u201d and starts setting Mr Novokoric\u2019s table, asking him politely to lift his drink so that he can lay a tablecloth down. Dan can feel that hard, ultramarine stare as he sets out a knife and fork he knows will remain untouched - the man seems to live on coffee alone - and tries to resist the urge to spew some garbled apology for yesterday\u2019s macchiato fiasco. </p><p>Before he can get it out however, Mr Novokoric speaks. \u201cSo, I asked Mona to order me a new phone, and some new skis.\u201d </p><p>The last word makes Dan drop a spoon. He bends down to get it, but he\u2019s not quick enough. Mr Novokoric hands it back to him, some curious sparkle hiding beneath his usual stern expression. </p><p>\u201cMore skis,\u201d Dan echoes, trying not to let his expression droop. So, it seems he\u2019s spent a good three hours of his life fixing a ski that will shortly be replaced. So much for being a good samaritan. \u201cRight. Are you asking me if they\u2019ve arrived? I can check, but I don\u2019t think Kaspar has brought them up yet-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangest thing, though,\u201d Mr Novokoric interrupts, as though Dan hadn\u2019t been in the middle of a sentence. \u201cI went to throw my old skis away, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with them. The strap\u2019s been mended.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Dan says, turning back to his basket for a new spoon. He sets it carefully on the table, trying to remain composed. \u201cWeird.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you fix it?\u201d </p><p>Pinned in place by Mr Novokoric\u2019s gaze, Dan feels his face turning from pink to red. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to overstep. I had no idea you\u2019d already ordered more-\u201d</p><p>He breaks off, wary of the strange expression being aimed at him. Mr Novokoric\u2019s eyes have softened, and there\u2019s something close to a smile threatening to break forth. The idea of him actually smiling is enough to fluster Dan into taking a hasty step backwards. The man is uncomfortably pretty as it is, which is confusing enough considering he\u2019s such an asshole. Dan doesn\u2019t know if he could handle a dazzling grin on top of that. </p><p>\u201cThat was\u2026 unexpected,\u201d Mr Novokoric says slowly. His smile still hasn\u2019t quite broken through, but his face has lost the hardness Dan is used to seeing. Without the usual frown lines and turned down corners of his mouth, he could even be beautiful. \u201cThank you. Of course, your repair is unneeded now, but I appreciate the gesture.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, um, no worries,\u201d Dan says, wondering how rude it would be to just run away. \u201cI had a spare minute, so\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot many people would have the initiative, let alone the intellect to do that,\u201d he says, draining the last of his coffee. He hold the mug out for Dan to take. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d </p><p>Feeling about three inches tall now, Dan just gives him a tight smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, and takes the mug. \u201cAnother coffee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Mr Novokoric answers, arching an eyebrow. \u201cWho\u2019s making it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cL-Louise,\u201d Dan says, cheeks hot again. </p><p>\u201cThen yes, please,\u201d he says, turning back to the view in front of him. </p><p>\u201cRight away, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan mutters, glad of the eventual opening to escape. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>Ugh, not so fast, it seems. \u201cYes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCall me Phil, if you like.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cLou, I have an urgent problem,\u201d Dan says, slamming into the kitchen. </p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up from the eggs she\u2019s scrambling. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take me a few hours to sort your hair out for you, Dan. I don\u2019t have time right now, I\u2019ve got to get breakfast out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I need you to teach me how to work the coffee machine,\u201d Dan says, smoothing his hair down self-consciously. </p><p>Louise looks up sharply, a smirk spreading over her mouth. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here on my own all weekend. I need to know how to make fancy coffees for\u2026 guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiatos?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll the different kinds!\u201d </p><p>Louise laughs in her long, pretty trill, and nods. \u201cAfter breakfast,\u201d she says. \u201cMeet me here, I\u2019ll give you a lesson.\u201d </p><p>Dan grins at her, then plucks a raspberry from a bowl nearby. \u201cOh, and Phil wants another cup when you have a sec.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Louise mutters, going back to the eggs. \u201cI\u2019ll get that for <i>Phil</i>.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan pretends not to hear the knowing smile hidden in her voice as he exits the kitchen. He jogs back outside then, just in time to usher the Lautrecs to their table.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>As it turns out, the coffee machine is going to take more than one lesson to master. Not because it\u2019s especially complicated - more because Dan is utterly inept. </p><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d Louise shrieks as Dan turns the wrong knob, and spurts actual boiling steam from the nozzle. Luckily, they both somehow manage to avoid getting scalded. \u201cMy God, Daniel, have you never watched the barista as they make your latte before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really very attentive,\u201d Dan says, sheepishly.\u00a0</p><p>He looks over the herd of coffees he\u2019s made over the last hour, all huddled together on the counter. The argument could probably be made that his most recent is better than the initial attempts, but that would hardly be a compliment. He imagines each of the milky, sludge-coloured concoctions is silently whispering \u2018<i>kill me, please</i>\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try a macchiato again.\u201d He\u2019s nothing if not determined.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be under the impression that I have nothing better to do than dodge you covering me in coffee granules,\u201d Louise says, wiping the nozzle clean. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get lunch going, so maybe we can pick this up tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is Friday,\u201d Dan protests. \u201cThat\u2019s the day you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018til the evening,\u201d Louise says. \u201cThere\u2019s enough time to squeeze in another lesson before that, God help me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust one more,\u201d Dan begs, giving her his most puppy-dog expression. \u201cJust show me the macchiato again. Please.\u201d</p><p>She sighs dramatically, sort of groaning. \u201cAlright, alright. Get the caramel syrup then.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not until Dan has the syrup in his hands that he realises Louise is insinuating that these macchiatos are for Phil. She aims a knowing smile at him, and Dan just ignores her, cheeks pink as he pours caramel into the mug. He\u2019s frothing milk, Louise shrieking instructions in his ear - <i>\u201ctilt the jug!\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re spraying it everywhere, push the nozzle down more!\u201d, \u201cnot that far, Christ!\u201d</i> - when he senses someone watching him. Mortified at the idea his foibles might be witnessed, Dan drops the jug and hot, not-so-frothy milk gushes everywhere, soaking his and Louise\u2019s shoes, and a lot of the kitchen floor. </p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m about to write you off as a lost cause!\u201d Louise shouts, tearing her hat off her head and storming to the sink to find a cloth. \u201cIf these shoes are ruined you\u2019re buying me more.\u201d</p><p>Dan barely hears her; he\u2019s too busy meeting the curious stare aimed at him. Phil Novokoric is sat at one of the indoor tables in the mezzanine, chin in his hand, watching Dan through the serving hatch. For some reason, Dan lifts his hand in a semblance of a wave; this seems to amuse Phil greatly, though he doesn\u2019t wave back. Instead, a small, barely-there smile graces his lips, presumably for himself, and then he gets up, and walks towards the stairs to the lobby.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Louise says, chucking a damp cloth at Dan. \u201cClean this up, then get the hell out of my kitchen. Coffee class resumes tomorrow.\u201d</p><p><b>(Chapter Five coming next Friday!)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a></p><p><br></p><p><b>Chapter Four</b></p><p>The night passes the same way - barely concealed crying, slightly ominous but mostly lovely music to drift him off to sleep - and then morning comes, stark and bright as usual. Dan gets dressed, begs Louise for coffee and sustenance -\u00a0<i>\u201cdid you find him?\u201d \u201cyes\u201d \u201cwere you nice?\u201d \u201cI was a peach\u201d \u201cwhat did he say?\u201d \u201che said he was sorry for yelling\u201d \u201caw, told you he was a sweetie deep down\u201d \u201cmmhmm\u201d -</i>\u00a0and is then rounded up by Mona for breakfast duty. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already switched the heaters on and put out the tablecloths,\u201d Mona tells him as he drains the last of his coffee. \u201cCould you just go and put the mugs and cutlery out? I think we\u2019ve only got two tables today.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Dan says, giving Louise\u2019s arm a small squeeze of gratitude for the breakfast and coffee; she waves a batter-y whisk at him in a shooing motion, but she\u2019s smiling. . </p>[[MORE]]<p>Once he\u2019s armed with a basket of silverware and crockery from the cupboard, Dan heads for the balcony and stops short, noticing that for the first time, someone is already sat out there. Stunned, Dan just stares through the glass at Mr Novokoric, who is transfixed on the blue-shadowed mountains in the distance. Reluctantly, Dan pushes through the doors, bracing himself for the cold, both from the frigid mountain air, and the attitude of his least favourite guest. </p><p>The door slams shut behind him, making Mr Novokoric turn. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he says, like an automatic greeting. For some reason - probably the cold and the pre-caffeine kick-in - Dan finds himself a little tongue-tied. He nods at the other man, struggling to hold onto the basket in his hands. </p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he manages, eyes sticking to the light wind-stung flush on Mr Novokoric\u2019s high cheeks. </p><p>Mr Novokoric turns back to the view then, and Dan begins setting out the mugs, knives, forks, spoons and glasses on the tables. He assumes that Mr Novokoric must be one of the two tables having breakfast today, which makes sense, as the Stevens\u2019 left yesterday evening. They\u2019d hugged Dan tightly, promising to return before the year was out. It had, in a way, been rather sad to see them disappearing with Kaspar back down the mountain in the swinging cable car. Mostly Dan is glad that he no longer has to avert his eyes as they walk through the hotel with their omnipresent robes dangerously loose, but they were a parental sort of couple, and he thinks they might genuinely miss him too. Fumbling only slightly, Dan begins to place a setting out in front of Mr Novokoric. As he sets the mug down, Mr Novokoric reaches for it, and frowns as he tilts it towards him. </p><p>\u201cCan I get some coffee?\u201d </p><p>Dan pauses, flipping the question over in his mind. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>One of those jet black eyebrows springs upwards. \u201cYes. Is that permitted?\u201d </p><p>Dan nods, blushing, and hating himself for it. He takes the mug and scampers off to the kitchen, managing to garble some request to Louise. For some reason his flustered state is amusing to her, and she pretends for a minute or two to have no clue what he\u2019s asking - not helpful - but eventually he gets a mug of filter coffee out of her. He watches, curious, as she automatically adds soya milk and two heaped teaspoons of sugar. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lactose intolerant,\u201d she says, by way of explanation. \u201cAnd has a hell of a sweet tooth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say who it\u2019s for,\u201d Dan says, perplexed, as he takes the mug from her. </p><p>\u201cWho else around here would have you blushing and stammering like a nun at a brothel?\u201d </p><p>Dan chooses not to respond to this, mostly because he can\u2019t summon anything except a mortified spluttering sound. He takes the mug of coffee back out to Mr Novokoric, cheeks still a warm pink. It\u2019s just the wind flush though, at this point. Probably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you like anything else, Sir?\u201d Dan asks politely. \u201cThe chef is still cooking breakfast, but I could perhaps get you some cereal or yoghurt-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Mr Novokoric says sniffily, and Dan replays what Louise just said to him. </p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, you don\u2019t have dairy,\u201d Dan says, shaking his head. Mr Novokoric turns his head sharply back to Dan, frowning. \u201cI could get you some fresh fruit? Or-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mr Novokoric says again, though his voice is less hostile now. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, not hungry.\u201d He pauses, mouth twitching. \u201c\u2026Thanks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Dan dithers, uncomfortably aware he now has a wedge of time to kill before the other guests emerge, and no other place to be. \u201cSo\u2026 um, why are you out here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p><p>Dan shuts his eyes, cursing silently. \u201cSorry, I just meant- you\u2019re normally out on the mountain at this time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mr Novokoric sips his drink, looking away. </p><p>\u201cDid you not fancy braving the snow today?\u201d</p><p>Dan has absolutely no idea why he\u2019s suddenly so intent on keeping this hellish conversation going, given that Mr Novokoric looks like he\u2019d rather pour the coffee over his own head than continue it. Somehow it would be worse to turn away from him though, to stand off to the side and wait for more guests to turn up, arms folded, pretending not to stare as that blank, unhappy glare washed away any animation on Mr Novokoric\u2019s sharp, striking features. So, Dan forces himself to stay rooted to the spot, letting Mr Novokoric\u2019s icy look of contemptuous horror at Dan\u2019s insistence on smalltalk slice through him like he\u2019s snow beneath Mr Novokoric\u2019s boot. </p><p>\u201cMy ski broke,\u201d he says, unexpectedly. </p><p>A flashback hits Dan as abruptly as the cherry-red skis hit the wall of the lobby the day before yesterday. \u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cIs there- it can\u2019t be fixed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt I\u2019m going to find someone proficient at winter sports equipment repair at the top of this fucking mountain, do you?\u201d </p><p>The curse word is shocking, and it takes Dan a moment to let it go. Phil\u2019s accent is slightly Northern, but his diction and use of language is impeccable, presumably due to all the hobnobbing and schmoozing he has to do, as a \u2018Royal\u2019. Hearing him swear is what he imagines it would be like hearing the Queen swear. In a sense, it\u2019s rather titillating - another reason Dan should abandon this conversation for good. Luckily, at that moment, the balcony door opens, and Mona ushers the two Bryce sisters through, leading them to the other laid table. </p><p>Relieved to see the chattering, marginally irritating middle-aged women for once, Dan excuses himself from Mr Novokoric, who barely bats an eye, and goes to take their breakfast order. </p><p>*</p><p>In a moment of downtime, while the evening film screening is going on, Dan goes hunting for two cherry-red skis, which he finds near the hotel entrance, leant against the wall. He takes hold of the left one, and examines it closely. Just as Mr Novokoric said, it has a broken appendage - the strap which secures the boot to the ski has come loose.\u00a0The straps are peculiar to Dan, having no backs to them, but Dan can see where the front part used to fix to the ski itself even so. By comparing it with the other ski, Dan thinks it\u2019s mendable. All too aware that he\u2019s got nothing better to do for the next few hours, Dan takes the ski over to the desk and lays it over his lap as he sits down to take a closer look.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s just because he\u2019s bored, he tells himself as he hunts for tools in Mona\u2019s office, and discovers a tiny screwdriver and screws in one of the cleaning cupboards, along with a pot of superglue. The film is a long one tonight - <i>The Italian Job</i> - so for a few hours Dan is able to work in complete solitude, listening to a faint Muse song through one headphone, and not stopping until the ski is fixed. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still holding a grudge against the poor man,\u201d Louise says, scrubbing at a pot with a scourer. Dan, sat up on one of the kitchen counters sipping hot chocolate, rolls his eyes. \u201cHe apologised for being rude, didn\u2019t he?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSome apology,\u201d Dan counters. Since two days ago in the gym, Dan has convinced himself that Mr Novokoric\u2019s words had been largely to smooth things over with the staff member he\u2019d pissed off, considering that it would be pretty awkward seeing him around the place 24-7 if they were not on speaking terms. In no way, Dan has decided, did Mr Novokoric actually mean what he said. \u201cJust because he\u2019s eloquent doesn\u2019t make him sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh-er,\u201d Louise says, flicking washing up water at him. He squeaks, shielding his hot chocolate. \u201cSounds like he got under your skin.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s next sip is too hot, and he burns his tongue. </p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Louise says, tipping out the saucepan and laying it out to dry. She starts untying her apron, wearily. \u201cThere\u2019s three hours until I\u2019ve got to start on dinner, so I think I\u2019ll have a little lie down. Can you hold the fort for a bit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Dan looks through the serving hatch into the empty mezzanine lounge. The Bryce sisters are the only guests staying here at the moment, though another couple are due to check in tonight. Right now, he\u2019s pretty sure the Bryce sisters - an excitable, childlike pair of forty-something women on what they refer to as a \u2018girls getaway\u2019 - are in the jacuzzi. If they were anywhere indoors, Dan is certain he\u2019d be able to hear their shrieks of laughter no matter which room they were in. \u201cSure, yeah. No worries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf you need me, I\u2019m in room three,\u201d Louise says, already on her way to the kitchen door. \u201cBut Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need me,\u201d she warns, and then exits the room. </p><p>*</p><p>About half an hour later, Dan is in the same position atop the kitchen counter, playing Crossy Road on his phone and polishing off a flapjack from the batch Louise made this morning. Suddenly, a noise like a throat clearing jolts him, and his animated emo goose is hit by a truck. He lowers the phone, head lifting, to see Mr Novokoric at the serving hatch, that cool assessing gaze chilling the temperature of the kitchen by at least two degrees. Dan swallows some flapjack the wrong way, and has to hide a mild choking fit.</p><p>In Mr Novokoric\u2019s hand is a mug. \u201cIs Louise here?\u201d he asks. </p><p>Dan shakes his head, swallowing his own tonsils to cleat the flapjack from his airway. His eyes water, but he gets down from the counter one gangly leg at a time. \u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he croaks. He wipes his hands of flapjack crumbs on a nearby tea-towel. \u201cShe\u2019s napping. Can I help?\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric appears troubled by this news, and takes a moment to reply, as if he\u2019s mulling something over. Eventually, whatever wins out, and he asks, \u201cany chance of some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHave you run out of the instant packets in your room? I can find some in the stock cupboard-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-o,\u201d Mr Novokoric interrupts, as if he\u2019s speaking with a half-wit. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for instant coffee. Louise usually makes me a macchiato, if I ask her.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s blood runs cold, and he turns to eye the bulky coffee machine sat menacingly on the far counter. \u201cRight,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cOf course she does.\u201d</p><p>Given his past failures to please Mr Novokoric thus far, he doesn\u2019t feel he can say \u2018oh, I\u2019m not actually sure how to work this machine, maybe it would be best to wait for Louise to wake up\u2019. So instead, Dan takes the mug, and steps warily over to the machine to attempt something called a \u2018macchiato\u2019. </p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiato,\u201d Mr Novokoric clarifies, at which Dan turns to blink at him, utterly bemused. </p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d he says, for some wild reason. \u201cNo problem.\u201d </p><p>As he surveys the contraption before him, Dan can feel eyes boring into the back of him - pure judgement coated in an intense, deep blue. He tries his best to ignore the prickle of skin this stare creates, and sets about mimicking what he can remember from watching Louise work the machine. He pours milk into one of the chrome jugs, shoves the spout into it and turns a dial. Droplets of milk immediately fly everywhere, and a monstrous hissing sound emerges from the beast. He quickly turns the dial back, abandoning that for now, and focuses on unfixing one of the espresso-filter-things from its lock. This takes a good two minutes of tugging and silently begging, during which time the milk in the jug seems to develop an appetising skin on top. At last, Dan pulls the thing free, dumps the used granules out and tamps some coffee into it, though he has no idea how much, and probably over-fills it. He does manage to fix it back in place, and over several agonising minutes the espresso drips through into the mug. When he can\u2019t stand the waiting any longer, knowing damn well he\u2019s being scrutinised, Dan takes the mug out, pours a dash of lukewarm milk into it from the jug, and takes it over to the hatch. </p><p>It looks\u2026. pretty vile. But he has to hand Mr Novokoric something. </p><p>\u201cUh, here we go. One macchiato.\u201d </p><p>He realises in the next moment that he forgot to add any caramel. Not that he\u2019d have any idea where to procure it from in this kitchen. Mr Novokoric looks down at the coffee in Dan\u2019s hand, sends him a look of something like pity, and makes no move to take it. </p><p>\u201cAaand suddenly I can think of nothing better than instant coffee,\u201d he says, nose wrinkling. </p><p>He turns away, heading back towards the stairs, leaving Dan with an undrinkable mug of coffee, and a sudden urge to hurl himself off the side of the mountain. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cDan, I need a word,\u201d Mona says, beckoning him into the small office at the back of reception. </p><p>It\u2019s early evening, and the neither the Bryce sisters nor the Lautrecs - a quiet French gay couple that arrived an hour or so ago - are interested in an evening film, so there\u2019s fuck all to do. Instantly upon hearing Mona\u2019s words, fear strikes Dan in the chest; he follows Mona into her office, heart in his throat.\u00a0</p><p>She gestures for him to sit on one of the wicker chairs in front of her desk, so he does, knee jiggling with nerves.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry Mona,\u201d Dan blurts before she\u2019s even sat down.\u00a0\u201cThe job description didn\u2019t say anything about being barista trained. If you received a complaint-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop you there, Dan,\u201d Mona says, loudly and shrilly.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are apologising for, but it\u2019s probably best if I never find out, hm?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Gulping down the relief that surges forth, Dan nods emphatically, and relaxes back into the chair. Mona looks a little more polished than usual today, he notes. She has a high-collared white blouse on, which elongates her neck, and a pearl-encrusted scrunchie securing her usual bun. Dan has begun to notice that Mona dresses a bit smarter on the days the mail is delivered, or when new guests arrive, or leave. In other words, any time Kaspar is expected to be around. Kaspar dropped off the Lautrecs earlier, so today is no exception.</p><p>Right now she sits at the small desk, hands clasped, and clears her throat. Her cheeks are tinged with rosy pink, probably from Kaspar\u2019s brief visit earlier. The idea of no-nonsense Mona having a teeny crush creates a warm glow in Dan\u2019s chest, and he smiles. \u201cI called you in here because I have some unfortunate news,\u201d Mona says. Dan\u2019s smile quickly vanishes. \u201cI\u2019ve been called away this weekend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, already confused. \u201cIs everything-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a personal matter,\u201d Mona tells him, firmly ending his inquiry before it\u2019s begun. \u201cBut the timing is poor, what with you having just started, and with it being Louise\u2019s weekend off.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments, the implications of this don\u2019t quite settle in. Then, Dan stops being quite so dim. \u201cWait, do you mean I\u2019d be here <i>alone</i>?\u201d </p><p>Mona avoids his eye, neatening some papers on her desk. \u201cI understand that it might seem rather daunting.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMona, I\u2019m nowhere near qualified to run this place on my own,\u201d Dan says in a rush, blood starting to pound loudly in his ears. </p><p>Just the thought of such responsibility is crushing; what if he forgot to serve lunch? What if he overslept and nobody was available for the guests? He\u2019s basically a glorified assistant here, he can\u2019t be expected to handle <i>real</i> decisions. </p><p>\u201cDan, it\u2019s just for a couple of days,\u201d Mona says; there\u2019s a pleading tone to her voice that Dan expects doesn\u2019t rear its head very often. \u201cJust until Louise returns on Sunday night. Kaspar can make it up here in a matter of hours if there\u2019s an emergency. But you won\u2019t need him. There\u2019s only one couple booked in to stay, and I doubt they\u2019ll be very high maintenance.\u201d </p><p>One couple and a narcissistic rich twat-face whose snobbery extends right down to his coffee order, Dan thinks, but begrudgingly admits to himself that Mr Novokoric is unlikely to be very demanding either. The man seems to keep mostly to himself unless he truly can\u2019t help it. Dan folds his arms across his chest, lip caught between his teeth. He can\u2019t really refuse, particularly as he suspects that Mona is desperate enough to get down onto her stocking-covered knees and beg him. Perhaps he <i>could</i> manage to keep the place afloat without any major screw-ups. But the stress of it all might kill him, even so. </p><p>\u201cI know this is completely unfair of me,\u201d Mona tells him, and reaches up to tug the pearl scrunchie out of her bun. The hair spills out, revealing a shoulder-length bob; the sight is so shocking that Dan feels his fingers twitching at his sides, as if he wants to scoop up the loose locks and pull them back into position. Mona runs both hands through the mess of hair, eyes fluttering shut. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask unless it were really important. Normally I\u2019d rather drop dead than leave this place in someone else\u2019s hands, even for a day or so, especially without Louise to help. But I just can\u2019t see another option. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s my grandmother, you see. She\u2019s ninety-four, and on her last legs-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan says quickly. He can\u2019t bear to see her like this; he doubts that even Louise, who\u2019s worked here for four years, has seen Mona with her hair down. Dan\u2019s never even seen Mona in plain clothes. She probably sleeps in her crisp skirt-suits. \u201cI can handle things,\u201d Dan assures her, hoping he has something akin to conviction in his tone, given that he\u2019s speaking out of his ass. \u201cLike you said, it\u2019s just a weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a phone call away,\u201d Mona promises, eyes reopening in order to look at Dan like he\u2019s Christ arisen. \u201cThank you, Dan. I\u2019ll remember this.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Mr Novokoric is sat at a table on the balcony again, just as Dan is about to set up for breakfast. He already has a coffee in front of him today, Dan notes, cheeks burning when he remembers yesterday\u2019s fiasco. Luckily it\u2019s windy again this morning, so he can blame the pink colour of his skin on that, if asked. </p><p>He mutters a \u201cgood morning\u201d and starts setting Mr Novokoric\u2019s table, asking him politely to lift his drink so that he can lay a tablecloth down. Dan can feel that hard, ultramarine stare as he sets out a knife and fork he knows will remain untouched - the man seems to live on coffee alone - and tries to resist the urge to spew some garbled apology for yesterday\u2019s macchiato fiasco. </p><p>Before he can get it out however, Mr Novokoric speaks. \u201cSo, I asked Mona to order me a new phone, and some new skis.\u201d </p><p>The last word makes Dan drop a spoon. He bends down to get it, but he\u2019s not quick enough. Mr Novokoric hands it back to him, some curious sparkle hiding beneath his usual stern expression. </p><p>\u201cMore skis,\u201d Dan echoes, trying not to let his expression droop. So, it seems he\u2019s spent a good three hours of his life fixing a ski that will shortly be replaced. So much for being a good samaritan. \u201cRight. Are you asking me if they\u2019ve arrived? I can check, but I don\u2019t think Kaspar has brought them up yet-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangest thing, though,\u201d Mr Novokoric interrupts, as though Dan hadn\u2019t been in the middle of a sentence. \u201cI went to throw my old skis away, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with them. The strap\u2019s been mended.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Dan says, turning back to his basket for a new spoon. He sets it carefully on the table, trying to remain composed. \u201cWeird.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you fix it?\u201d </p><p>Pinned in place by Mr Novokoric\u2019s gaze, Dan feels his face turning from pink to red. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to overstep. I had no idea you\u2019d already ordered more-\u201d</p><p>He breaks off, wary of the strange expression being aimed at him. Mr Novokoric\u2019s eyes have softened, and there\u2019s something close to a smile threatening to break forth. The idea of him actually smiling is enough to fluster Dan into taking a hasty step backwards. The man is uncomfortably pretty as it is, which is confusing enough considering he\u2019s such an asshole. Dan doesn\u2019t know if he could handle a dazzling grin on top of that. </p><p>\u201cThat was\u2026 unexpected,\u201d Mr Novokoric says slowly. His smile still hasn\u2019t quite broken through, but his face has lost the hardness Dan is used to seeing. Without the usual frown lines and turned down corners of his mouth, he could even be beautiful. \u201cThank you. Of course, your repair is unneeded now, but I appreciate the gesture.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, um, no worries,\u201d Dan says, wondering how rude it would be to just run away. \u201cI had a spare minute, so\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot many people would have the initiative, let alone the intellect to do that,\u201d he says, draining the last of his coffee. He hold the mug out for Dan to take. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d </p><p>Feeling about three inches tall now, Dan just gives him a tight smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, and takes the mug. \u201cAnother coffee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Mr Novokoric answers, arching an eyebrow. \u201cWho\u2019s making it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cL-Louise,\u201d Dan says, cheeks hot again. </p><p>\u201cThen yes, please,\u201d he says, turning back to the view in front of him. </p><p>\u201cRight away, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan mutters, glad of the eventual opening to escape. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>Ugh, not so fast, it seems. \u201cYes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCall me Phil, if you like.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cLou, I have an urgent problem,\u201d Dan says, slamming into the kitchen. </p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up from the eggs she\u2019s scrambling. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take me a few hours to sort your hair out for you, Dan. I don\u2019t have time right now, I\u2019ve got to get breakfast out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I need you to teach me how to work the coffee machine,\u201d Dan says, smoothing his hair down self-consciously. </p><p>Louise looks up sharply, a smirk spreading over her mouth. \u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here on my own all weekend. I need to know how to make fancy coffees for\u2026 guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaramel macchiatos?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll the different kinds!\u201d </p><p>Louise laughs in her long, pretty trill, and nods. \u201cAfter breakfast,\u201d she says. \u201cMeet me here, I\u2019ll give you a lesson.\u201d </p><p>Dan grins at her, then plucks a raspberry from a bowl nearby. \u201cOh, and Phil wants another cup when you have a sec.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Louise mutters, going back to the eggs. \u201cI\u2019ll get that for <i>Phil</i>.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Dan pretends not to hear the knowing smile hidden in her voice as he exits the kitchen. He jogs back outside then, just in time to usher the Lautrecs to their table.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>As it turns out, the coffee machine is going to take more than one lesson to master. Not because it\u2019s especially complicated - more because Dan is utterly inept. </p><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d Louise shrieks as Dan turns the wrong knob, and spurts actual boiling steam from the nozzle. Luckily, they both somehow manage to avoid getting scalded. \u201cMy God, Daniel, have you never watched the barista as they make your latte before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really very attentive,\u201d Dan says, sheepishly.\u00a0</p><p>He looks over the herd of coffees he\u2019s made over the last hour, all huddled together on the counter. The argument could probably be made that his most recent is better than the initial attempts, but that would hardly be a compliment. He imagines each of the milky, sludge-coloured concoctions is silently whispering \u2018<i>kill me, please</i>\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try a macchiato again.\u201d He\u2019s nothing if not determined.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be under the impression that I have nothing better to do than dodge you covering me in coffee granules,\u201d Louise says, wiping the nozzle clean. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get lunch going, so maybe we can pick this up tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is Friday,\u201d Dan protests. \u201cThat\u2019s the day you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018til the evening,\u201d Louise says. \u201cThere\u2019s enough time to squeeze in another lesson before that, God help me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust one more,\u201d Dan begs, giving her his most puppy-dog expression. \u201cJust show me the macchiato again. Please.\u201d</p><p>She sighs dramatically, sort of groaning. \u201cAlright, alright. Get the caramel syrup then.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not until Dan has the syrup in his hands that he realises Louise is insinuating that these macchiatos are for Phil. She aims a knowing smile at him, and Dan just ignores her, cheeks pink as he pours caramel into the mug. He\u2019s frothing milk, Louise shrieking instructions in his ear - <i>\u201ctilt the jug!\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re spraying it everywhere, push the nozzle down more!\u201d, \u201cnot that far, Christ!\u201d</i> - when he senses someone watching him. Mortified at the idea his foibles might be witnessed, Dan drops the jug and hot, not-so-frothy milk gushes everywhere, soaking his and Louise\u2019s shoes, and a lot of the kitchen floor. </p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m about to write you off as a lost cause!\u201d Louise shouts, tearing her hat off her head and storming to the sink to find a cloth. \u201cIf these shoes are ruined you\u2019re buying me more.\u201d</p><p>Dan barely hears her; he\u2019s too busy meeting the curious stare aimed at him. Phil Novokoric is sat at one of the indoor tables in the mezzanine, chin in his hand, watching Dan through the serving hatch. For some reason, Dan lifts his hand in a semblance of a wave; this seems to amuse Phil greatly, though he doesn\u2019t wave back. Instead, a small, barely-there smile graces his lips, presumably for himself, and then he gets up, and walks towards the stairs to the lobby.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Louise says, chucking a damp cloth at Dan. \u201cClean this up, then get the hell out of my kitchen.

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Chapter Four</b></p><p>The night passes the same way - barely concealed crying, slightly ominous but mostly lovely music to drift him off to sleep - and then morning comes, stark and bright as usual. Dan gets dressed, begs Louise for coffee and sustenance -&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;did you find him?&rdquo; &ldquo;yes&rdquo; &ldquo;were you nice?&rdquo; &ldquo;I was a peach&rdquo; &ldquo;what did he say?&rdquo; &ldquo;he said he was sorry for yelling&rdquo; &ldquo;aw, told you he was a sweetie deep down&rdquo; &ldquo;mmhmm&rdquo; -</i>&nbsp;and is then rounded up by Mona for breakfast duty. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already switched the heaters on and put out the tablecloths,&rdquo; Mona tells him as he drains the last of his coffee. &ldquo;Could you just go and put the mugs and cutlery out? I think we&rsquo;ve only got two tables today.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan says, giving Louise&rsquo;s arm a small squeeze of gratitude for the breakfast and coffee; she waves a batter-y whisk at him in a shooing motion, but she&rsquo;s smiling. . </p><p>Once he&rsquo;s armed with a basket of silverware and crockery from the cupboard, Dan heads for the balcony and stops short, noticing that for the first time, someone is already sat out there. Stunned, Dan just stares through the glass at Mr Novokoric, who is transfixed on the blue-shadowed mountains in the distance. Reluctantly, Dan pushes through the doors, bracing himself for the cold, both from the frigid mountain air, and the attitude of his least favourite guest. </p><p>The door slams shut behind him, making Mr Novokoric turn. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he says, like an automatic greeting. For some reason - probably the cold and the pre-caffeine kick-in - Dan finds himself a little tongue-tied. He nods at the other man, struggling to hold onto the basket in his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he manages, eyes sticking to the light wind-stung flush on Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s high cheeks. </p><p>Mr Novokoric turns back to the view then, and Dan begins setting out the mugs, knives, forks, spoons and glasses on the tables. He assumes that Mr Novokoric must be one of the two tables having breakfast today, which makes sense, as the Stevens&rsquo; left yesterday evening. They&rsquo;d hugged Dan tightly, promising to return before the year was out. It had, in a way, been rather sad to see them disappearing with Kaspar back down the mountain in the swinging cable car. Mostly Dan is glad that he no longer has to avert his eyes as they walk through the hotel with their omnipresent robes dangerously loose, but they were a parental sort of couple, and he thinks they might genuinely miss him too. Fumbling only slightly, Dan begins to place a setting out in front of Mr Novokoric. As he sets the mug down, Mr Novokoric reaches for it, and frowns as he tilts it towards him. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I get some coffee?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan pauses, flipping the question over in his mind. &ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo;</p><p>One of those jet black eyebrows springs upwards. &ldquo;Yes. Is that permitted?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nods, blushing, and hating himself for it. He takes the mug and scampers off to the kitchen, managing to garble some request to Louise. For some reason his flustered state is amusing to her, and she pretends for a minute or two to have no clue what he&rsquo;s asking - not helpful - but eventually he gets a mug of filter coffee out of her. He watches, curious, as she automatically adds soya milk and two heaped teaspoons of sugar. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lactose intolerant,&rdquo; she says, by way of explanation. &ldquo;And has a hell of a sweet tooth.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say who it&rsquo;s for,&rdquo; Dan says, perplexed, as he takes the mug from her. </p><p>&ldquo;Who else around here would have you blushing and stammering like a nun at a brothel?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan chooses not to respond to this, mostly because he can&rsquo;t summon anything except a mortified spluttering sound. He takes the mug of coffee back out to Mr Novokoric, cheeks still a warm pink. It&rsquo;s just the wind flush though, at this point. Probably.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like anything else, Sir?&rdquo; Dan asks politely. &ldquo;The chef is still cooking breakfast, but I could perhaps get you some cereal or yoghurt-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric says sniffily, and Dan replays what Louise just said to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, you don&rsquo;t have dairy,&rdquo; Dan says, shaking his head. Mr Novokoric turns his head sharply back to Dan, frowning. &ldquo;I could get you some fresh fruit? Or-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric says again, though his voice is less hostile now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, uh, not hungry.&rdquo; He pauses, mouth twitching. &ldquo;&hellip;Thanks.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; Dan dithers, uncomfortably aware he now has a wedge of time to kill before the other guests emerge, and no other place to be. &ldquo;So&hellip; um, why are you out here?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shuts his eyes, cursing silently. &ldquo;Sorry, I just meant- you&rsquo;re normally out on the mountain at this time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Mr Novokoric sips his drink, looking away. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you not fancy braving the snow today?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan has absolutely no idea why he&rsquo;s suddenly so intent on keeping this hellish conversation going, given that Mr Novokoric looks like he&rsquo;d rather pour the coffee over his own head than continue it. Somehow it would be worse to turn away from him though, to stand off to the side and wait for more guests to turn up, arms folded, pretending not to stare as that blank, unhappy glare washed away any animation on Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s sharp, striking features. So, Dan forces himself to stay rooted to the spot, letting Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s icy look of contemptuous horror at Dan&rsquo;s insistence on smalltalk slice through him like he&rsquo;s snow beneath Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s boot. </p><p>&ldquo;My ski broke,&rdquo; he says, unexpectedly. </p><p>A flashback hits Dan as abruptly as the cherry-red skis hit the wall of the lobby the day before yesterday. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Is there- it can&rsquo;t be fixed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I highly doubt I&rsquo;m going to find someone proficient at winter sports equipment repair at the top of this fucking mountain, do you?&rdquo; </p><p>The curse word is shocking, and it takes Dan a moment to let it go. Phil&rsquo;s accent is slightly Northern, but his diction and use of language is impeccable, presumably due to all the hobnobbing and schmoozing he has to do, as a &lsquo;Royal&rsquo;. Hearing him swear is what he imagines it would be like hearing the Queen swear. In a sense, it&rsquo;s rather titillating - another reason Dan should abandon this conversation for good. Luckily, at that moment, the balcony door opens, and Mona ushers the two Bryce sisters through, leading them to the other laid table. </p><p>Relieved to see the chattering, marginally irritating middle-aged women for once, Dan excuses himself from Mr Novokoric, who barely bats an eye, and goes to take their breakfast order. </p><p>*</p><p>In a moment of downtime, while the evening film screening is going on, Dan goes hunting for two cherry-red skis, which he finds near the hotel entrance, leant against the wall. He takes hold of the left one, and examines it closely. Just as Mr Novokoric said, it has a broken appendage - the strap which secures the boot to the ski has come loose.&nbsp;The straps are peculiar to Dan, having no backs to them, but Dan can see where the front part used to fix to the ski itself even so. By comparing it with the other ski, Dan thinks it&rsquo;s mendable. All too aware that he&rsquo;s got nothing better to do for the next few hours, Dan takes the ski over to the desk and lays it over his lap as he sits down to take a closer look.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s just because he&rsquo;s bored, he tells himself as he hunts for tools in Mona&rsquo;s office, and discovers a tiny screwdriver and screws in one of the cleaning cupboards, along with a pot of superglue. The film is a long one tonight - <i>The Italian Job</i> - so for a few hours Dan is able to work in complete solitude, listening to a faint Muse song through one headphone, and not stopping until the ski is fixed. </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re still holding a grudge against the poor man,&rdquo; Louise says, scrubbing at a pot with a scourer. Dan, sat up on one of the kitchen counters sipping hot chocolate, rolls his eyes. &ldquo;He apologised for being rude, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Some apology,&rdquo; Dan counters. Since two days ago in the gym, Dan has convinced himself that Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s words had been largely to smooth things over with the staff member he&rsquo;d pissed off, considering that it would be pretty awkward seeing him around the place 24-7 if they were not on speaking terms. In no way, Dan has decided, did Mr Novokoric actually mean what he said. &ldquo;Just because he&rsquo;s eloquent doesn&rsquo;t make him sincere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh-er,&rdquo; Louise says, flicking washing up water at him. He squeaks, shielding his hot chocolate. &ldquo;Sounds like he got under your skin.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s next sip is too hot, and he burns his tongue. </p><p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Louise says, tipping out the saucepan and laying it out to dry. She starts untying her apron, wearily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s three hours until I&rsquo;ve got to start on dinner, so I think I&rsquo;ll have a little lie down. Can you hold the fort for a bit?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; Dan looks through the serving hatch into the empty mezzanine lounge. The Bryce sisters are the only guests staying here at the moment, though another couple are due to check in tonight. Right now, he&rsquo;s pretty sure the Bryce sisters - an excitable, childlike pair of forty-something women on what they refer to as a &lsquo;girls getaway&rsquo; - are in the jacuzzi. If they were anywhere indoors, Dan is certain he&rsquo;d be able to hear their shrieks of laughter no matter which room they were in. &ldquo;Sure, yeah. No worries.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If you need me, I&rsquo;m in room three,&rdquo; Louise says, already on her way to the kitchen door. &ldquo;But Dan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need me,&rdquo; she warns, and then exits the room. </p><p>*</p><p>About half an hour later, Dan is in the same position atop the kitchen counter, playing Crossy Road on his phone and polishing off a flapjack from the batch Louise made this morning. Suddenly, a noise like a throat clearing jolts him, and his animated emo goose is hit by a truck. He lowers the phone, head lifting, to see Mr Novokoric at the serving hatch, that cool assessing gaze chilling the temperature of the kitchen by at least two degrees. Dan swallows some flapjack the wrong way, and has to hide a mild choking fit.</p><p>In Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s hand is a mug. &ldquo;Is Louise here?&rdquo; he asks. </p><p>Dan shakes his head, swallowing his own tonsils to cleat the flapjack from his airway. His eyes water, but he gets down from the counter one gangly leg at a time. &ldquo;No, sorry,&rdquo; he croaks. He wipes his hands of flapjack crumbs on a nearby tea-towel. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s napping. Can I help?&rdquo; </p><p>Mr Novokoric appears troubled by this news, and takes a moment to reply, as if he&rsquo;s mulling something over. Eventually, whatever wins out, and he asks, &ldquo;any chance of some coffee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Have you run out of the instant packets in your room? I can find some in the stock cupboard-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric interrupts, as if he&rsquo;s speaking with a half-wit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for instant coffee. Louise usually makes me a macchiato, if I ask her.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s blood runs cold, and he turns to eye the bulky coffee machine sat menacingly on the far counter. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Dan mutters. &ldquo;Of course she does.&rdquo;</p><p>Given his past failures to please Mr Novokoric thus far, he doesn&rsquo;t feel he can say &lsquo;oh, I&rsquo;m not actually sure how to work this machine, maybe it would be best to wait for Louise to wake up&rsquo;. So instead, Dan takes the mug, and steps warily over to the machine to attempt something called a &lsquo;macchiato&rsquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;Caramel macchiato,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric clarifies, at which Dan turns to blink at him, utterly bemused. </p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; he says, for some wild reason. &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; </p><p>As he surveys the contraption before him, Dan can feel eyes boring into the back of him - pure judgement coated in an intense, deep blue. He tries his best to ignore the prickle of skin this stare creates, and sets about mimicking what he can remember from watching Louise work the machine. He pours milk into one of the chrome jugs, shoves the spout into it and turns a dial. Droplets of milk immediately fly everywhere, and a monstrous hissing sound emerges from the beast. He quickly turns the dial back, abandoning that for now, and focuses on unfixing one of the espresso-filter-things from its lock. This takes a good two minutes of tugging and silently begging, during which time the milk in the jug seems to develop an appetising skin on top. At last, Dan pulls the thing free, dumps the used granules out and tamps some coffee into it, though he has no idea how much, and probably over-fills it. He does manage to fix it back in place, and over several agonising minutes the espresso drips through into the mug. When he can&rsquo;t stand the waiting any longer, knowing damn well he&rsquo;s being scrutinised, Dan takes the mug out, pours a dash of lukewarm milk into it from the jug, and takes it over to the hatch. </p><p>It looks&hellip;. pretty vile. But he has to hand Mr Novokoric something. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, here we go. One macchiato.&rdquo; </p><p>He realises in the next moment that he forgot to add any caramel. Not that he&rsquo;d have any idea where to procure it from in this kitchen. Mr Novokoric looks down at the coffee in Dan&rsquo;s hand, sends him a look of something like pity, and makes no move to take it. </p><p>&ldquo;Aaand suddenly I can think of nothing better than instant coffee,&rdquo; he says, nose wrinkling. </p><p>He turns away, heading back towards the stairs, leaving Dan with an undrinkable mug of coffee, and a sudden urge to hurl himself off the side of the mountain. </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I need a word,&rdquo; Mona says, beckoning him into the small office at the back of reception. </p><p>It&rsquo;s early evening, and the neither the Bryce sisters nor the Lautrecs - a quiet French gay couple that arrived an hour or so ago - are interested in an evening film, so there&rsquo;s fuck all to do. Instantly upon hearing Mona&rsquo;s words, fear strikes Dan in the chest; he follows Mona into her office, heart in his throat.&nbsp;</p><p>She gestures for him to sit on one of the wicker chairs in front of her desk, so he does, knee jiggling with nerves.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry Mona,&rdquo; Dan blurts before she&rsquo;s even sat down.&nbsp;&ldquo;The job description didn&rsquo;t say anything about being barista trained. If you received a complaint-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stop you there, Dan,&rdquo; Mona says, loudly and shrilly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are apologising for, but it&rsquo;s probably best if I never find out, hm?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Gulping down the relief that surges forth, Dan nods emphatically, and relaxes back into the chair. Mona looks a little more polished than usual today, he notes. She has a high-collared white blouse on, which elongates her neck, and a pearl-encrusted scrunchie securing her usual bun. Dan has begun to notice that Mona dresses a bit smarter on the days the mail is delivered, or when new guests arrive, or leave. In other words, any time Kaspar is expected to be around. Kaspar dropped off the Lautrecs earlier, so today is no exception.</p><p>Right now she sits at the small desk, hands clasped, and clears her throat. Her cheeks are tinged with rosy pink, probably from Kaspar&rsquo;s brief visit earlier. The idea of no-nonsense Mona having a teeny crush creates a warm glow in Dan&rsquo;s chest, and he smiles. &ldquo;I called you in here because I have some unfortunate news,&rdquo; Mona says. Dan&rsquo;s smile quickly vanishes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been called away this weekend.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says, already confused. &ldquo;Is everything-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a personal matter,&rdquo; Mona tells him, firmly ending his inquiry before it&rsquo;s begun. &ldquo;But the timing is poor, what with you having just started, and with it being Louise&rsquo;s weekend off.&rdquo;</p><p>For a few moments, the implications of this don&rsquo;t quite settle in. Then, Dan stops being quite so dim. &ldquo;Wait, do you mean I&rsquo;d be here <i>alone</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>Mona avoids his eye, neatening some papers on her desk. &ldquo;I understand that it might seem rather daunting.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mona, I&rsquo;m nowhere near qualified to run this place on my own,&rdquo; Dan says in a rush, blood starting to pound loudly in his ears. </p><p>Just the thought of such responsibility is crushing; what if he forgot to serve lunch? What if he overslept and nobody was available for the guests? He&rsquo;s basically a glorified assistant here, he can&rsquo;t be expected to handle <i>real</i> decisions. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, it&rsquo;s just for a couple of days,&rdquo; Mona says; there&rsquo;s a pleading tone to her voice that Dan expects doesn&rsquo;t rear its head very often. &ldquo;Just until Louise returns on Sunday night. Kaspar can make it up here in a matter of hours if there&rsquo;s an emergency. But you won&rsquo;t need him. There&rsquo;s only one couple booked in to stay, and I doubt they&rsquo;ll be very high maintenance.&rdquo; </p><p>One couple and a narcissistic rich twat-face whose snobbery extends right down to his coffee order, Dan thinks, but begrudgingly admits to himself that Mr Novokoric is unlikely to be very demanding either. The man seems to keep mostly to himself unless he truly can&rsquo;t help it. Dan folds his arms across his chest, lip caught between his teeth. He can&rsquo;t really refuse, particularly as he suspects that Mona is desperate enough to get down onto her stocking-covered knees and beg him. Perhaps he <i>could</i> manage to keep the place afloat without any major screw-ups. But the stress of it all might kill him, even so. </p><p>&ldquo;I know this is completely unfair of me,&rdquo; Mona tells him, and reaches up to tug the pearl scrunchie out of her bun. The hair spills out, revealing a shoulder-length bob; the sight is so shocking that Dan feels his fingers twitching at his sides, as if he wants to scoop up the loose locks and pull them back into position. Mona runs both hands through the mess of hair, eyes fluttering shut. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ask unless it were really important. Normally I&rsquo;d rather drop dead than leave this place in someone else&rsquo;s hands, even for a day or so, especially without Louise to help. But I just can&rsquo;t see another option. It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s my grandmother, you see. She&rsquo;s ninety-four, and on her last legs-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Dan says quickly. He can&rsquo;t bear to see her like this; he doubts that even Louise, who&rsquo;s worked here for four years, has seen Mona with her hair down. Dan&rsquo;s never even seen Mona in plain clothes. She probably sleeps in her crisp skirt-suits. &ldquo;I can handle things,&rdquo; Dan assures her, hoping he has something akin to conviction in his tone, given that he&rsquo;s speaking out of his ass. &ldquo;Like you said, it&rsquo;s just a weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a phone call away,&rdquo; Mona promises, eyes reopening in order to look at Dan like he&rsquo;s Christ arisen. &ldquo;Thank you, Dan. I&rsquo;ll remember this.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Mr Novokoric is sat at a table on the balcony again, just as Dan is about to set up for breakfast. He already has a coffee in front of him today, Dan notes, cheeks burning when he remembers yesterday&rsquo;s fiasco. Luckily it&rsquo;s windy again this morning, so he can blame the pink colour of his skin on that, if asked. </p><p>He mutters a &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; and starts setting Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s table, asking him politely to lift his drink so that he can lay a tablecloth down. Dan can feel that hard, ultramarine stare as he sets out a knife and fork he knows will remain untouched - the man seems to live on coffee alone - and tries to resist the urge to spew some garbled apology for yesterday&rsquo;s macchiato fiasco. </p><p>Before he can get it out however, Mr Novokoric speaks. &ldquo;So, I asked Mona to order me a new phone, and some new skis.&rdquo; </p><p>The last word makes Dan drop a spoon. He bends down to get it, but he&rsquo;s not quick enough. Mr Novokoric hands it back to him, some curious sparkle hiding beneath his usual stern expression. </p><p>&ldquo;More skis,&rdquo; Dan echoes, trying not to let his expression droop. So, it seems he&rsquo;s spent a good three hours of his life fixing a ski that will shortly be replaced. So much for being a good samaritan. &ldquo;Right. Are you asking me if they&rsquo;ve arrived? I can check, but I don&rsquo;t think Kaspar has brought them up yet-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Strangest thing, though,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric interrupts, as though Dan hadn&rsquo;t been in the middle of a sentence. &ldquo;I went to throw my old skis away, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with them. The strap&rsquo;s been mended.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; Dan says, turning back to his basket for a new spoon. He sets it carefully on the table, trying to remain composed. &ldquo;Weird.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Did you fix it?&rdquo; </p><p>Pinned in place by Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s gaze, Dan feels his face turning from pink to red. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to overstep. I had no idea you&rsquo;d already ordered more-&rdquo;</p><p>He breaks off, wary of the strange expression being aimed at him. Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s eyes have softened, and there&rsquo;s something close to a smile threatening to break forth. The idea of him actually smiling is enough to fluster Dan into taking a hasty step backwards. The man is uncomfortably pretty as it is, which is confusing enough considering he&rsquo;s such an asshole. Dan doesn&rsquo;t know if he could handle a dazzling grin on top of that. </p><p>&ldquo;That was&hellip; unexpected,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric says slowly. His smile still hasn&rsquo;t quite broken through, but his face has lost the hardness Dan is used to seeing. Without the usual frown lines and turned down corners of his mouth, he could even be beautiful. &ldquo;Thank you. Of course, your repair is unneeded now, but I appreciate the gesture.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, um, no worries,&rdquo; Dan says, wondering how rude it would be to just run away. &ldquo;I had a spare minute, so&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not many people would have the initiative, let alone the intellect to do that,&rdquo; he says, draining the last of his coffee. He hold the mug out for Dan to take. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo; </p><p>Feeling about three inches tall now, Dan just gives him a tight smile. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he says through gritted teeth, and takes the mug. &ldquo;Another coffee?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Depends,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric answers, arching an eyebrow. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s making it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;L-Louise,&rdquo; Dan says, cheeks hot again. </p><p>&ldquo;Then yes, please,&rdquo; he says, turning back to the view in front of him. </p><p>&ldquo;Right away, Mr Novokoric,&rdquo; Dan mutters, glad of the eventual opening to escape. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; </p><p>Ugh, not so fast, it seems. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Call me Phil, if you like.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Lou, I have an urgent problem,&rdquo; Dan says, slamming into the kitchen. </p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t look up from the eggs she&rsquo;s scrambling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna take me a few hours to sort your hair out for you, Dan. I don&rsquo;t have time right now, I&rsquo;ve got to get breakfast out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What? No, I need you to teach me how to work the coffee machine,&rdquo; Dan says, smoothing his hair down self-consciously. </p><p>Louise looks up sharply, a smirk spreading over her mouth. &ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be here on my own all weekend. I need to know how to make fancy coffees for&hellip; guests.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Caramel macchiatos?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;All the different kinds!&rdquo; </p><p>Louise laughs in her long, pretty trill, and nods. &ldquo;After breakfast,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Meet me here, I&rsquo;ll give you a lesson.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan grins at her, then plucks a raspberry from a bowl nearby. &ldquo;Oh, and Phil wants another cup when you have a sec.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Louise mutters, going back to the eggs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get that for <i>Phil</i>.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Dan pretends not to hear the knowing smile hidden in her voice as he exits the kitchen. He jogs back outside then, just in time to usher the Lautrecs to their table.&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>As it turns out, the coffee machine is going to take more than one lesson to master. Not because it&rsquo;s especially complicated - more because Dan is utterly inept. </p><p>&ldquo;Watch it!&rdquo; Louise shrieks as Dan turns the wrong knob, and spurts actual boiling steam from the nozzle. Luckily, they both somehow manage to avoid getting scalded. &ldquo;My God, Daniel, have you never watched the barista as they make your latte before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really very attentive,&rdquo; Dan says, sheepishly.&nbsp;</p><p>He looks over the herd of coffees he&rsquo;s made over the last hour, all huddled together on the counter. The argument could probably be made that his most recent is better than the initial attempts, but that would hardly be a compliment. He imagines each of the milky, sludge-coloured concoctions is silently whispering &lsquo;<i>kill me, please</i>&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s try a macchiato again.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s nothing if not determined.</p><p>&ldquo;You seem to be under the impression that I have nothing better to do than dodge you covering me in coffee granules,&rdquo; Louise says, wiping the nozzle clean. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get lunch going, so maybe we can pick this up tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow is Friday,&rdquo; Dan protests. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the day you leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not &lsquo;til the evening,&rdquo; Louise says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough time to squeeze in another lesson before that, God help me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just one more,&rdquo; Dan begs, giving her his most puppy-dog expression. &ldquo;Just show me the macchiato again. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>She sighs dramatically, sort of groaning. &ldquo;Alright, alright. Get the caramel syrup then.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not until Dan has the syrup in his hands that he realises Louise is insinuating that these macchiatos are for Phil. She aims a knowing smile at him, and Dan just ignores her, cheeks pink as he pours caramel into the mug. He&rsquo;s frothing milk, Louise shrieking instructions in his ear - <i>&ldquo;tilt the jug!&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re spraying it everywhere, push the nozzle down more!&rdquo;, &ldquo;not that far, Christ!&rdquo;</i> - when he senses someone watching him. Mortified at the idea his foibles might be witnessed, Dan drops the jug and hot, not-so-frothy milk gushes everywhere, soaking his and Louise&rsquo;s shoes, and a lot of the kitchen floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I&rsquo;m about to write you off as a lost cause!&rdquo; Louise shouts, tearing her hat off her head and storming to the sink to find a cloth. &ldquo;If these shoes are ruined you&rsquo;re buying me more.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan barely hears her; he&rsquo;s too busy meeting the curious stare aimed at him. Phil Novokoric is sat at one of the indoor tables in the mezzanine, chin in his hand, watching Dan through the serving hatch. For some reason, Dan lifts his hand in a semblance of a wave; this seems to amuse Phil greatly, though he doesn&rsquo;t wave back. Instead, a small, barely-there smile graces his lips, presumably for himself, and then he gets up, and walks towards the stairs to the lobby.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Louise says, chucking a damp cloth at Dan. &ldquo;Clean this up, then get the hell out of my kitchen. Coffee class resumes tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p><b>(Chapter Five coming next Friday!)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p>\n<p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><b>Chapter Four</b></p>\n<p>The night passes the same way - barely concealed crying, slightly ominous but mostly lovely music to drift him off to sleep - and then morning comes, stark and bright as usual.
