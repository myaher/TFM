I heard you talking about Steve&rsquo;s chest last night.&rdquo; Natasha said, making her blush. &ldquo;Come on Nat, look at the guy!&rdquo; She defend, she laughs. </p><p><br/></p><p>Later on, Natasha sees Bucky half asleep on the couch, she runs over to him and wakes him up. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Barnes.&rdquo; She says loudly. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Nat, Jesus.&rdquo; He says in a flustered manor. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I need to tell you something.&rdquo; She says, Bucky laughs. &ldquo;Oh no, I thought you couldn&rsquo;t get pregnant.

Well, I guess this was pointless.&rdquo; She gets up, and walks away. Bucky stands up and looks for Y/N around the tower.</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N is finished with her shower, and walks into her room with her silk robe and her eye covers over her forehead. Bucky sits on her bed, startled she nearly drops her loosely tied robe. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Bucky? What are you doing in here?&rdquo; She held it tightly, he stands up and towers over her. &ldquo;Just wanted to say goodnight.&rdquo; He said in a secretly seductive tone, she swallows deeply and tries to contain the excitement going on below. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;G-Goodnight.&rdquo; She stammers, Bucky smiles and lets her go past him, his hand on her back as she sat down on her bed. &ldquo;Sweet dreams princess.&rdquo; He says and walks out her room, slowly closing her door. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;W-What just happened.&rdquo; She says to herself, feeling aroused. Wanda walks in and sits next to her on her bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I know I always do this..but..what happened to make you think like that?&rdquo; She asks. &ldquo;Think what?&rdquo; Y/N says, hoping wanda wasn&rsquo;t referring to your thoughts about Bucky. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;About Bucky.&rdquo; She says, concerned about your dirty mind. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, I have a huge crush on him, and I know he knows that, he always teases me, and he always calls me princess, and doll, and sweetheart, the list of lover names go on.&rdquo; Y/N complains, Wanda frowns. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Just ask him out.

She got everyone&rsquo;s attention with it, but not one questioned her on the sudden change of her usual light blue super skinny jeans and forever 21 T-shirts. But she did catch Bucky&rsquo;s eye. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Bucky.&rdquo; She said, sitting in front of him at the bar counter, her breasts purposely hanging out. He kept his eyes strictly on his arm, until he realised she was actually there. &ldquo;Hey Y/N.&rdquo; He said, quickly glancing down.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you sleep?&rdquo; He asked, refocusing to his arm. &ldquo;Like a angel.&rdquo; She says, sitting up straight. &ldquo;I bet.&rdquo; He said, still focused on his arm. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Can I see your arm?&rdquo; She asks, her looks at her and nods suspiciously. He reaches his Vibranium arm across the bar counter. She rubbed it, slowly, hoping that was seduce him. Instead it confused him, and made him laugh.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard.&rdquo; She says, taking quick glance down, indicating Bucky had a erection. He snickered. &ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo; He asks, she nodded and bit her lip slightly. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; He says taking his arm back and letting it hang to his sides. &ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You seem different today.&rdquo; He said, still laughing at her effort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always like this, what are you going on about?&rdquo; She says, fixing her bra. &ldquo;Yeah, Sure you are. Uh. Do you want breakfast? I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo; He said and hopped of the stool, Y/N pouts. </p><p><br/></p><p>She observes her efforts aren&rsquo;t successful. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure, I&rsquo;ll have whatever you make.&rdquo; She says and plops down in the couch, frustrated. </p><p><br/></p><p>Does he even have interest in me?</p><p><br/></p><p>Is his only interest in me teasing me?</p><p><br/></p><p>Ugh, I&rsquo;ll never had a significant other before college.</p><p><br/></p><p>Bucky finishes cooking and hands Y/N a plate</p><p><br/></p><p>He sits directly next to her and wraps his arm around her shoulders, Y/N shudders slightly at his touch. He turns on the TV and turns to Y/F/C [if you even use cable lmao I barley do]</p><p><br/></p><p>She looks up at him, then at his arm. Did it work? She thinks, she slowly nuzzles her head into his chest, feeling his heart beat and still fascinated that it&rsquo;s still beating after all these years. Bucky attempts to ignore her, but he just can&rsquo;t. </p><p><br/></p><p>Once the show subsides, Bucky gets the plates and places them in the loaded dishwasher. She fell asleep on him later into the show, she had no idea what had happened between then and when she awoke. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Did you get any sleep last night?&rdquo; Bucky asks, sitting next to her again. &ldquo;Not much.&rdquo; She says. &ldquo;Y/N, tell me the truth. Are you ok?&rdquo; He asks, Y/N nods. &ldquo;I am, I s-&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N- tell me what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo; He says. Still not convinced. &ldquo;Bucky, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She says. Bucky frowns. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared to tell me anything sweetheart.&rdquo; He says, Y/N&rsquo;s heart palpitates at the mere sound of Sweetheart from his lips. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t Bucky, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s-&rdquo; She stammers, Bucky chuckles and kisses her lips, she doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to kiss him back. &ldquo;I already know. y/n.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Already know what?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;That you like me.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you, I love you.&rdquo; She corrects. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; He says and kisses her lips, she moans at the feeling of his soft lips against his. </p><p><br/></p><p>She lays on top of him, and kisses his neck. </p><p><br/></p><p>Finally. I thought I was just embarrassing myself.</p><p><br/></p><p>Wanda walks in, immediately running out once she spots the two.</p>",

Bucky stands up and looks for Y/N around the tower.</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N is finished with her shower, and walks into her room with her silk robe and her eye covers over her forehead. Bucky sits on her bed, startled she nearly drops her loosely tied robe. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBucky? What are you doing in here?\u201d She held it tightly, he stands up and towers over her. \u201cJust wanted to say goodnight.\u201d He said in a secretly seductive tone, she swallows deeply and tries to contain the excitement going on below. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cG-Goodnight.\u201d She stammers, Bucky smiles and lets her go past him, his hand on her back as she sat down on her bed. \u201cSweet dreams princess.\u201d He says and walks out her room, slowly closing her door. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cW-What just happened.\u201d She says to herself, feeling aroused.

Even he had never thought he would come this far. Just a friendly neighborhood kid from Queens, and now he was the business mogul Forbes magazine called Tony Stark-Lite. He could see the comparison, that billionaire playboy had once been his mentor. Inside the world of business and out.</p><p>Taking another sip of his hot coffee, Peter opened the news feed on his desktop to see what was going on in the world. A local article, by Peter\u2019s close friend Ben Urich caught his eye. Opening the link to the Daily Bugle page, the full article spread out before him: </p><p>Monsters in New York? What&rsquo;s new?!</p><p>Last night, Hank\u2019s tavern was the subject of two attacks. The first was apparently a gang-related drive-by shooting. Nothing big for the big apple.</p><p>But, according to witnesses, the second assault was instigated by \u2018a wolfman\u2019 with \u2018claws and fur and everything!\u2019</p><p>What&rsquo;s going on New York? Monday night it was Frankenstein, last night it was the wolfman! When are these Monster Murders going to stop? When are the authorities going to do something? Is this even a real thing?</p><p>Police refute the existence of these monsters, claiming the violence is the result of escalated tensions between rival street gangs. Most of the victims last night were known to be affiliated with the Flashing Blades. All of them, as well as the NYPD and other frightened civilians would like to think locals Misty Knight and Jessica Jones for having been there to save the day. According to one of the young toughs \u2018'If it weren&rsquo;t for those super-broads we&rsquo;d all be dead right now! The Maggia is behind all this! Better watch out, Hammerhead cuz the Heroes For Hire are gonna getcha.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>The ten-by-ten cell smelt of antiseptic and sterility. The phosphorescent bulbs blinked in the cage embedded into the ceiling of his cell. There was no window for him to see it through, but he heard the moon in the night&rsquo;s sky. He heard it beckoning to him, calling him to arms. It needed him to carry out it&rsquo;s bidding. If he did not something terrible was going to happen, if only he could be sure of what.</p><p>But he was unsure of everything. He had been sure he would be able to stop the thief at the Met after escaping, it was what Knoshu had led him to do. It was his destiny. He had failed.</p><p>He sat in a single-man cell in the intensive management unit of the New York jail. He had been segregated after an altercation with half the inmates in his assigned dorm. Most of them ended up in the infirmary with severe wounds, and in one case internal bleeding. The scum of the city had mocked him, and were only more blind fools oblivious to the duty they impede him from performing.</p><p>Marc hadn&rsquo;t slept since his arrest on Monday, and tho he had no way of keeping track of the time in isolation it was Wednesday. Every time he tried to rest, his mind would not allow it. He was bombarded with visions. Same as the premonitions he had prior to escaping Ravencroft, but different. Much more vivid in detail. Mixed with memories, and hard to decipher. He barely ate the meager meals they provided him. His health was deteriorating.</p><p>The loudspeaker built into the locking mechanism crackled with static. \u201cMr. Spector?\u201d a gravelly voice called. \u201cYou&rsquo;ve got an attorney visit. Stand against the far wall facing it with your hands behind your back.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy sat patiently in his side of the visiting booth for dangerous inmates. Considering the privacy one is legally given with their defense counsel no cameras were on either the visitor or inmates side. The loudspeakers and call buttons built into the locking mechanism also came wired with microphones, and these had recorded many inadvertent admissions of guilt for a number of defendants. But, taking any efforts to corrupt the recordings would be suspicious so Foggy did not.</p><p>The buzzing and whirring of a door opening alerted Foggy. On the other side of the shatterproof glass the door opened and Marc Spector entered in handcuffs. He was seated roughly by an attending corrections officer who then exited, leaving the two alone.</p><p>Foggy looked at Marc, and wondered how Matt had seen someone worth saving. Marc seemed a shell of a man. His dark brown hair seemed to be prematurely thinning on top, or migrated to the unkempt beard that had begun sprouting on his face. His dark eyes sat sunken into hollow sockets ringed by the shadow of restlessness. His jumpsuit seemed much too large for him like he was swimming in the polyester of the fabric.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Spector, I\u2019m Mr. Nelson of Nelson &amp; Murdock attorneys at law. I have to chosen to defend you against the allegations the state of New York has filed against you for crimes believed to have been committed on Monday, October 31st of this year.\u201d</p><p>Marc said nothing but only intensely gazed at Foggy through the glass. Marc\u2019s eyes seemed glazed. Like he was hardly there.</p><p>\u201cYou havent given anything necessarily incriminating to the cops, which is good, but that&rsquo;s because you haven&rsquo;t given anyone much of anything to work with. Let&rsquo;s start there. I need to know your story.\u201d</p><p>Marc sat in silence, eyes twitching to and fro as he continued to stare at Foggy.</p><p>The two of them sat at the same table in the same room, but saw two completely different things opposite them. Foggy saw a broken man. A man who had once done great things, but had now succumb to illness. Marc saw a glowing man in a fine white suit with a Hawk\u2019s skull where it&rsquo;s head should&rsquo;ve been. It&rsquo;s eyeless sockets bore into him. It&rsquo;s voice did not emanate from its body as much as just appeared in Marc\u2019s mind.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cThis already isn&rsquo;t going nearly as well as i hoped.\u201d The raven headed man&rsquo;s voice echoed.</p><p>Marc blinked at the strange man. \u201cKnoshu?\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy looked confusedly at Marc. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Marc did not reply. Foggy became irritated.</p><p>\u201cLook, i know that you aren&rsquo;t a bad guy. I know that you saved a lot of people and kept a lot of people from getting hurt. You were the 24th Avenger, for chrissakes! You&rsquo;ve gotta be a good guy if my partner Matt Murdock was willing to vouch for you. But, unless you are willing to talk to me you are going to end up rotting in a cell. Not even a hospital this time Marc, worse i promise.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you would help him.\u201d Jake Lockley said to the Bird-skull from behind Marc, placing his hand on Marc\u2019s shoulder to show support.</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy shook his head confusedly at Marc. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Marc wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his jumpsuit and said again. \u201cHe said - \u2018'Maybe if you help me\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is help you! That&rsquo;s the only reason I\u2019m here.\u201d Foggy fumed.</p><p>-</p><p>A bright blue flame burned in the eyes of the bird-skull as it leaned forward at Matt. \u201cAll that has ever been done for you could be considered help! What about when uou were saved from death in the desert all those years ago?\u201d</p><p>Marc hung his head with the shame of reality from those weighted words. He would not be there if Knoshu had not brought him back from the very brink of death in the bowels of a pyramid in Egypt. He had been left betrayed and for dead by his former partner. Prayed to Knoshu, begged for help and had received it.</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. It is just that i have been here for so long. I had to wait forever just to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? In my mind?\u201d Marc asked scanning Foggy\u2019s face intensely.</p><p>\u201cIs that where you think this is?\u201d Foggy bewilderedly queried.</p><p>-</p><p>Marc now saw Jake Lockley and Steven Grant now standing behind the bird-skull.</p><p>\u201cIf we aren&rsquo;t in my mind\u2026 Where? Where are we??\u201d Marc questioned.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cYou and I are in the visiting room for intensive management inmates in the New York city jail. Do you remember why?\u201d Foggy returned.</p><p>\u201cMarc. He started having the visions again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarc. That&rsquo;s right. And who are you?\u201d Foggy scratched his head, and checked the picture on his file again.</p><p>\u201cSteven Grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entrepreneur who went missing a few years back?\u201d Foggy recollected the name as he had been an affluent man in the New York area.</p><p>\u201cLet&rsquo;s just say Marc and i have always been real close.\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cOk&hellip;so, let&rsquo;s start with the escape from Ravencroft, since that&rsquo;s the most obvious place for you. Why did you escape?\u201d Foggy asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, he was getting his visions again. His \u2018'messages from the moon\u2019, and he thought that something bad was going to happen. He had to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why him&hellip;I mean, why you?!\u201d Foggy asked.</p><p>\u201cI am the Sentry of the night, the moon&rsquo;s punishing fist and loyal guardian!\u201d Marc suddenly barked, with a sudden alteration of demeanor.</p><p>\u201cOk. So, then assuming that that&rsquo;s all perfectly sane and rational why were you wearing a spit-mask?\u201d Foggy slightly chuckled as he looked through some of the addition photos in his file.</p><p>\u201cIt bore the sigil of the moon upon it, illuminating the darkness. It granted me my sight. Allowed me to see their true faces.\u201d Marc said as if it were common knowledge.</p><p>\u201cTrue faces?\u201d</p><p>Another paradigm shift and Marc began slouching in his chair. \u201cThe best way i describe it, buddy, is like lifting a veil. He could see the \u00a0enemies of Knoshu when he had it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they look like? Just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnubis.\u201d</p><p>With that Foggy closed the folder and rolled his head on his neck. He did not know what help Foggy would be able to provide this man besides full committal to a psychiatric ward. Even believing this man did not have anything to do with the heist, as unstable as he clearly was seemed less likely. He was about to stand up to press the call button and be let out when he gave one final futile stab. \u201cDid Moon Knight steal, or have anything to do with the theft of the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very theft is what we were trying to prevent. \u2018The Madman\u2019s mutterings\u2019. We were on the roof when we saw the darkness fill the library. Some figure in the shadow picked up a nearby chair and shattered the case with it. We couldn&rsquo;t see who it was, but the darkness\u2026.it was familiar. Marc recognized it from somewhere. It was then that the security guards arrived and thwarted us. They became enemies of Knoshu and have all abetted the thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who really stole the book? Who was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. It&rsquo;s hazy. The night shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the night shift security at the Met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they want with the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo commit great evil! The luminous moon has conveyed to me dread and doom for the future of New York if the book is not reclaimed.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Matt Murdock sat silently in the lobby of the jail, as Foggy carried on the pre-arraignment interview with Marc in a secluded visiting area. However, Matt was still able to eavesdrop. Despite Foggy\u2019s worries that his attendance at the jail during his partner&rsquo;s interview with Moon Knight would be suspicious, he went to try to gather as much information for himself as he could. Using his heightened senses he tried to decipher Marc\u2019s disturbed ramblings, while internally applauding Foggy for his patience.</p><p>Suddenly, he caught a familiar scent on the air. The clack of high-heel boots on ceramic tile-floor carried Misty Knight down the halls of the jail and towards the lobby where he sat. Matt had not seen Misty since his return to Hell\u2019s kitchen from San Francisco. He had no idea how the reunion would go, as Misty had been one of the few he had clashed with in the conflict leading up to his departure from his hometown. That was a different time, and he had become something he was not. He was who he was supposed to be now. </p><p>\u201cMatt Murdock??!!\u201d Misty asked shocked and hurriedly walked over to him.</p><p>Matt braced himself for what would happen, but the woman quickly grabbed him in a hug and squeezed him close.</p><p>\u201cMisty. You noticed me.\u201d Matt commented.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you&rsquo;d be surprised how much the blind guy actually sticks out in a room. Besides, i was never the one with the problems seeing.\u201d Misty joked. Mart could hear a genuine relief to see him. Accelerated heart rate to suggest happiness but signs of concern in her metabolics.</p><p>\u201cHa. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, all things considered. How are you and when did you get back into New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m good. Really good. Thank you so much for asking.\u201d Matt took her hand in his and held it for a moment as a gesture of gratitude. \u201cI&rsquo;ve only just recently gotten into an apartment. Seems rent has dropped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProperty value went to shit. All these young kids with something to prove want to look cool in front of their friends and shoot up the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGangs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Something else too.\u201d Misty paused for a second, reminded of their surroundings. \u201cWhy are you here? Did you already manage to get yourself into trouble again?\u201d</p><p>As she asked Foggy, having finished the interview with Marc ran into them in the hallway. \u201cAnd Foggy came to bail you out again, didn&rsquo;t he?\u201d Misty added and laughed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mrs. Knight, it&rsquo;s a pleasure.\u201d Foggy happily shook Misty\u2019s hand. \u201cNo, we&rsquo;re here meeting a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, i was just following up on some stuff that went down last night. Also needed to talk to Marc Spector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarc just so happens to be our client.\u201d Foggy admitted.</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Misty couldn&rsquo;t believe that not only was Matt Murdock back in hell\u2019s kitchen, but was already back in the muck. \u201cWhat were the odds of that?\u201d she asked looking directly at Matt.</p><p>\u201cTax records indicate that Marc was once gainfully employed through your company Heroes For Hire inc. Right?\u201d Matt asked back.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He was. But that was some time ago. He hasnt been with us for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait? Heroes For Hire is going again?\u201d Matt became focused.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they&rsquo;ve been up for a few months now. I actually heard word of it while Misty and i were helping each other during my time with the DA\u2019s office.\u201d Foggy chimed in. He did not like the way Matt started acting, after hearing about Heroes For Hire.</p><p>\u201cWe have a contract to return the book, and given the spot he&rsquo;s in now i thought maybe Marc would be able to shed some light on what happened.\u201d Misty said.</p><p>\u201cBright guy, That Marc Spector.\u201d Foggy said.</p><p>\u201cHe&rsquo;s always been a little strange, but it always seemed to have a reason to him. Like there really was a method to his madness.\u201d Misty responded.</p><p>\u201cThere just might be. I think he could catch the thief.\u201d Matt stated.</p><p>\u201cHe knows who did it?\u201d</p>",

Even he had never thought he would come this far. Just a friendly neighborhood kid from Queens, and now he was the business mogul Forbes magazine called Tony Stark-Lite. He could see the comparison, that billionaire playboy had once been his mentor. Inside the world of business and out.</p><p>Taking another sip of his hot coffee, Peter opened the news feed on his desktop to see what was going on in the world. A local article, by Peter\u2019s close friend Ben Urich caught his eye. Opening the link to the Daily Bugle page, the full article spread out before him: </p><p>Monsters in New York? What\u2019s new?!</p><p>Last night, Hank\u2019s tavern was the subject of two attacks. The first was apparently a gang-related drive-by shooting. Nothing big for the big apple.</p><p>But, according to witnesses, the second assault was instigated by \u2018a wolfman\u2019 with \u2018claws and fur and everything!\u2019</p><p>What\u2019s going on New York? Monday night it was Frankenstein, last night it was the wolfman! When are these Monster Murders going to stop? When are the authorities going to do something? Is this even a real thing?</p><p>Police refute the existence of these monsters, claiming the violence is the result of escalated tensions between rival street gangs. Most of the victims last night were known to be affiliated with the Flashing Blades. All of them, as well as the NYPD and other frightened civilians would like to think locals Misty Knight and Jessica Jones for having been there to save the day. According to one of the young toughs \u2018'If it weren\u2019t for those super-broads we\u2019d all be dead right now! The Maggia is behind all this! Better watch out, Hammerhead cuz the Heroes For Hire are gonna getcha.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>The ten-by-ten cell smelt of antiseptic and sterility. The phosphorescent bulbs blinked in the cage embedded into the ceiling of his cell. There was no window for him to see it through, but he heard the moon in the night\u2019s sky. He heard it beckoning to him, calling him to arms. It needed him to carry out it\u2019s bidding. If he did not something terrible was going to happen, if only he could be sure of what.</p><p>But he was unsure of everything. He had been sure he would be able to stop the thief at the Met after escaping, it was what Knoshu had led him to do. It was his destiny. He had failed.</p><p>He sat in a single-man cell in the intensive management unit of the New York jail. He had been segregated after an altercation with half the inmates in his assigned dorm. Most of them ended up in the infirmary with severe wounds, and in one case internal bleeding. The scum of the city had mocked him, and were only more blind fools oblivious to the duty they impede him from performing.</p><p>Marc hadn\u2019t slept since his arrest on Monday, and tho he had no way of keeping track of the time in isolation it was Wednesday. Every time he tried to rest, his mind would not allow it. He was bombarded with visions. Same as the premonitions he had prior to escaping Ravencroft, but different. Much more vivid in detail. Mixed with memories, and hard to decipher. He barely ate the meager meals they provided him. His health was deteriorating.</p><p>The loudspeaker built into the locking mechanism crackled with static. \u201cMr. Spector?\u201d a gravelly voice called. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an attorney visit. Stand against the far wall facing it with your hands behind your back.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy sat patiently in his side of the visiting booth for dangerous inmates. Considering the privacy one is legally given with their defense counsel no cameras were on either the visitor or inmates side. The loudspeakers and call buttons built into the locking mechanism also came wired with microphones, and these had recorded many inadvertent admissions of guilt for a number of defendants. But, taking any efforts to corrupt the recordings would be suspicious so Foggy did not.</p><p>The buzzing and whirring of a door opening alerted Foggy. On the other side of the shatterproof glass the door opened and Marc Spector entered in handcuffs. He was seated roughly by an attending corrections officer who then exited, leaving the two alone.</p><p>Foggy looked at Marc, and wondered how Matt had seen someone worth saving. Marc seemed a shell of a man. His dark brown hair seemed to be prematurely thinning on top, or migrated to the unkempt beard that had begun sprouting on his face. His dark eyes sat sunken into hollow sockets ringed by the shadow of restlessness. His jumpsuit seemed much too large for him like he was swimming in the polyester of the fabric.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Spector, I\u2019m Mr. Nelson of Nelson &amp; Murdock attorneys at law. I have to chosen to defend you against the allegations the state of New York has filed against you for crimes believed to have been committed on Monday, October 31st of this year.\u201d</p><p>Marc said nothing but only intensely gazed at Foggy through the glass. Marc\u2019s eyes seemed glazed. Like he was hardly there.</p><p>\u201cYou havent given anything necessarily incriminating to the cops, which is good, but that\u2019s because you haven\u2019t given anyone much of anything to work with. Let\u2019s start there. I need to know your story.\u201d</p><p>Marc sat in silence, eyes twitching to and fro as he continued to stare at Foggy.</p><p>The two of them sat at the same table in the same room, but saw two completely different things opposite them. Foggy saw a broken man. A man who had once done great things, but had now succumb to illness. Marc saw a glowing man in a fine white suit with a Hawk\u2019s skull where it\u2019s head should\u2019ve been. It\u2019s eyeless sockets bore into him. It\u2019s voice did not emanate from its body as much as just appeared in Marc\u2019s mind.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cThis already isn\u2019t going nearly as well as i hoped.\u201d The raven headed man\u2019s voice echoed.</p><p>Marc blinked at the strange man. \u201cKnoshu?\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy looked confusedly at Marc. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Marc did not reply. Foggy became irritated.</p><p>\u201cLook, i know that you aren\u2019t a bad guy. I know that you saved a lot of people and kept a lot of people from getting hurt. You were the 24th Avenger, for chrissakes! You\u2019ve gotta be a good guy if my partner Matt Murdock was willing to vouch for you. But, unless you are willing to talk to me you are going to end up rotting in a cell. Not even a hospital this time Marc, worse i promise.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you would help him.\u201d Jake Lockley said to the Bird-skull from behind Marc, placing his hand on Marc\u2019s shoulder to show support.</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy shook his head confusedly at Marc. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Marc wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his jumpsuit and said again. \u201cHe said - \u2018'Maybe if you help me\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is help you! That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m here.\u201d Foggy fumed.</p><p>-</p><p>A bright blue flame burned in the eyes of the bird-skull as it leaned forward at Matt. \u201cAll that has ever been done for you could be considered help! What about when uou were saved from death in the desert all those years ago?\u201d</p><p>Marc hung his head with the shame of reality from those weighted words. He would not be there if Knoshu had not brought him back from the very brink of death in the bowels of a pyramid in Egypt. He had been left betrayed and for dead by his former partner. Prayed to Knoshu, begged for help and had received it.</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. It is just that i have been here for so long. I had to wait forever just to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? In my mind?\u201d Marc asked scanning Foggy\u2019s face intensely.</p><p>\u201cIs that where you think this is?\u201d Foggy bewilderedly queried.</p><p>-</p><p>Marc now saw Jake Lockley and Steven Grant now standing behind the bird-skull.</p><p>\u201cIf we aren\u2019t in my mind\u2026 Where? Where are we??\u201d Marc questioned.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cYou and I are in the visiting room for intensive management inmates in the New York city jail. Do you remember why?\u201d Foggy returned.</p><p>\u201cMarc. He started having the visions again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarc. That\u2019s right. And who are you?\u201d Foggy scratched his head, and checked the picture on his file again.</p><p>\u201cSteven Grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entrepreneur who went missing a few years back?\u201d Foggy recollected the name as he had been an affluent man in the New York area.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say Marc and i have always been real close.\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cOk\u2026so, let\u2019s start with the escape from Ravencroft, since that\u2019s the most obvious place for you. Why did you escape?\u201d Foggy asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, he was getting his visions again. His \u2018'messages from the moon\u2019, and he thought that something bad was going to happen. He had to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why him\u2026I mean, why you?!\u201d Foggy asked.</p><p>\u201cI am the Sentry of the night, the moon\u2019s punishing fist and loyal guardian!\u201d Marc suddenly barked, with a sudden alteration of demeanor.</p><p>\u201cOk. So, then assuming that that\u2019s all perfectly sane and rational why were you wearing a spit-mask?\u201d Foggy slightly chuckled as he looked through some of the addition photos in his file.</p><p>\u201cIt bore the sigil of the moon upon it, illuminating the darkness. It granted me my sight. Allowed me to see their true faces.\u201d Marc said as if it were common knowledge.</p><p>\u201cTrue faces?\u201d</p><p>Another paradigm shift and Marc began slouching in his chair. \u201cThe best way i describe it, buddy, is like lifting a veil.

He could see the comparison, that billionaire playboy had once been his mentor. Inside the world of business and out.</p><p>Taking another sip of his hot coffee, Peter opened the news feed on his desktop to see what was going on in the world. A local article, by Peter&rsquo;s close friend Ben Urich caught his eye. Opening the link to the Daily Bugle page, the full article spread out before him: </p><p>Monsters in New York? What&rsquo;s new?!</p><p>Last night, Hank&rsquo;s tavern was the subject of two attacks. The first was apparently a gang-related drive-by shooting. Nothing big for the big apple.</p><p>But, according to witnesses, the second assault was instigated by &lsquo;a wolfman&rsquo; with &lsquo;claws and fur and everything!&rsquo;</p><p>What&rsquo;s going on New York? Monday night it was Frankenstein, last night it was the wolfman! When are these Monster Murders going to stop? When are the authorities going to do something? Is this even a real thing?</p><p>Police refute the existence of these monsters, claiming the violence is the result of escalated tensions between rival street gangs. Most of the victims last night were known to be affiliated with the Flashing Blades. All of them, as well as the NYPD and other frightened civilians would like to think locals Misty Knight and Jessica Jones for having been there to save the day. According to one of the young toughs &lsquo;'If it weren&rsquo;t for those super-broads we&rsquo;d all be dead right now! The Maggia is behind all this! Better watch out, Hammerhead cuz the Heroes For Hire are gonna getcha.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>The ten-by-ten cell smelt of antiseptic and sterility. The phosphorescent bulbs blinked in the cage embedded into the ceiling of his cell. There was no window for him to see it through, but he heard the moon in the night&rsquo;s sky. He heard it beckoning to him, calling him to arms. It needed him to carry out it&rsquo;s bidding. If he did not something terrible was going to happen, if only he could be sure of what.</p><p>But he was unsure of everything. He had been sure he would be able to stop the thief at the Met after escaping, it was what Knoshu had led him to do. It was his destiny. He had failed.</p><p>He sat in a single-man cell in the intensive management unit of the New York jail. He had been segregated after an altercation with half the inmates in his assigned dorm. Most of them ended up in the infirmary with severe wounds, and in one case internal bleeding. The scum of the city had mocked him, and were only more blind fools oblivious to the duty they impede him from performing.</p><p>Marc hadn&rsquo;t slept since his arrest on Monday, and tho he had no way of keeping track of the time in isolation it was Wednesday. Every time he tried to rest, his mind would not allow it. He was bombarded with visions. Same as the premonitions he had prior to escaping Ravencroft, but different. Much more vivid in detail. Mixed with memories, and hard to decipher. He barely ate the meager meals they provided him. His health was deteriorating.</p><p>The loudspeaker built into the locking mechanism crackled with static. &ldquo;Mr. Spector?&rdquo; a gravelly voice called. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got an attorney visit. Stand against the far wall facing it with your hands behind your back.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy sat patiently in his side of the visiting booth for dangerous inmates. Considering the privacy one is legally given with their defense counsel no cameras were on either the visitor or inmates side. The loudspeakers and call buttons built into the locking mechanism also came wired with microphones, and these had recorded many inadvertent admissions of guilt for a number of defendants. But, taking any efforts to corrupt the recordings would be suspicious so Foggy did not.</p><p>The buzzing and whirring of a door opening alerted Foggy. On the other side of the shatterproof glass the door opened and Marc Spector entered in handcuffs. He was seated roughly by an attending corrections officer who then exited, leaving the two alone.</p><p>Foggy looked at Marc, and wondered how Matt had seen someone worth saving. Marc seemed a shell of a man. His dark brown hair seemed to be prematurely thinning on top, or migrated to the unkempt beard that had begun sprouting on his face. His dark eyes sat sunken into hollow sockets ringed by the shadow of restlessness. His jumpsuit seemed much too large for him like he was swimming in the polyester of the fabric.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Spector, I&rsquo;m Mr. Nelson of Nelson &amp; Murdock attorneys at law. I have to chosen to defend you against the allegations the state of New York has filed against you for crimes believed to have been committed on Monday, October 31st of this year.&rdquo;</p><p>Marc said nothing but only intensely gazed at Foggy through the glass. Marc&rsquo;s eyes seemed glazed. Like he was hardly there.</p><p>&ldquo;You havent given anything necessarily incriminating to the cops, which is good, but that&rsquo;s because you haven&rsquo;t given anyone much of anything to work with. Let&rsquo;s start there. I need to know your story.&rdquo;</p><p>Marc sat in silence, eyes twitching to and fro as he continued to stare at Foggy.</p><p>The two of them sat at the same table in the same room, but saw two completely different things opposite them. Foggy saw a broken man. A man who had once done great things, but had now succumb to illness. Marc saw a glowing man in a fine white suit with a Hawk&rsquo;s skull where it&rsquo;s head should&rsquo;ve been. It&rsquo;s eyeless sockets bore into him. It&rsquo;s voice did not emanate from its body as much as just appeared in Marc&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;This already isn&rsquo;t going nearly as well as i hoped.&rdquo; The raven headed man&rsquo;s voice echoed.</p><p>Marc blinked at the strange man. &ldquo;Knoshu?&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy looked confusedly at Marc. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Marc did not reply. Foggy became irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, i know that you aren&rsquo;t a bad guy. I know that you saved a lot of people and kept a lot of people from getting hurt. You were the 24th Avenger, for chrissakes! You&rsquo;ve gotta be a good guy if my partner Matt Murdock was willing to vouch for you. But, unless you are willing to talk to me you are going to end up rotting in a cell. Not even a hospital this time Marc, worse i promise.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if you would help him.&rdquo; Jake Lockley said to the Bird-skull from behind Marc, placing his hand on Marc&rsquo;s shoulder to show support.</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy shook his head confusedly at Marc. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Marc wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his jumpsuit and said again. &ldquo;He said - &lsquo;'Maybe if you help me&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;m trying to do is help you! That&rsquo;s the only reason I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; Foggy fumed.</p><p>-</p><p>A bright blue flame burned in the eyes of the bird-skull as it leaned forward at Matt. &ldquo;All that has ever been done for you could be considered help! What about when uou were saved from death in the desert all those years ago?&rdquo;</p><p>Marc hung his head with the shame of reality from those weighted words. He would not be there if Knoshu had not brought him back from the very brink of death in the bowels of a pyramid in Egypt. He had been left betrayed and for dead by his former partner. Prayed to Knoshu, begged for help and had received it.</p><p>-</p><p>Foggy sighed. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m sorry. It is just that i have been here for so long. I had to wait forever just to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here? In my mind?&rdquo; Marc asked scanning Foggy&rsquo;s face intensely.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that where you think this is?&rdquo; Foggy bewilderedly queried.</p><p>-</p><p>Marc now saw Jake Lockley and Steven Grant now standing behind the bird-skull.</p><p>&ldquo;If we aren&rsquo;t in my mind&hellip; Where? Where are we??&rdquo; Marc questioned.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;You and I are in the visiting room for intensive management inmates in the New York city jail. Do you remember why?&rdquo; Foggy returned.</p><p>&ldquo;Marc. He started having the visions again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marc. That&rsquo;s right. And who are you?&rdquo; Foggy scratched his head, and checked the picture on his file again.</p><p>&ldquo;Steven Grant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The entrepreneur who went missing a few years back?&rdquo; Foggy recollected the name as he had been an affluent man in the New York area.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say Marc and i have always been real close.&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok&hellip;so, let&rsquo;s start with the escape from Ravencroft, since that&rsquo;s the most obvious place for you. Why did you escape?&rdquo; Foggy asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he was getting his visions again. His &lsquo;'messages from the moon&rsquo;, and he thought that something bad was going to happen. He had to stop it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, why him&hellip;I mean, why you?!&rdquo; Foggy asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the Sentry of the night, the moon&rsquo;s punishing fist and loyal guardian!&rdquo; Marc suddenly barked, with a sudden alteration of demeanor.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. So, then assuming that that&rsquo;s all perfectly sane and rational why were you wearing a spit-mask?&rdquo; Foggy slightly chuckled as he looked through some of the addition photos in his file.</p><p>&ldquo;It bore the sigil of the moon upon it, illuminating the darkness. It granted me my sight. Allowed me to see their true faces.&rdquo; Marc said as if it were common knowledge.</p><p>&ldquo;True faces?&rdquo;</p><p>Another paradigm shift and Marc began slouching in his chair. &ldquo;The best way i describe it, buddy, is like lifting a veil. He could see the &nbsp;enemies of Knoshu when he had it on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do they look like? Just curious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anubis.&rdquo;</p><p>With that Foggy closed the folder and rolled his head on his neck. He did not know what help Foggy would be able to provide this man besides full committal to a psychiatric ward. Even believing this man did not have anything to do with the heist, as unstable as he clearly was seemed less likely. He was about to stand up to press the call button and be let out when he gave one final futile stab. &ldquo;Did Moon Knight steal, or have anything to do with the theft of the book?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The very theft is what we were trying to prevent. &lsquo;The Madman&rsquo;s mutterings&rsquo;. We were on the roof when we saw the darkness fill the library. Some figure in the shadow picked up a nearby chair and shattered the case with it. We couldn&rsquo;t see who it was, but the darkness&hellip;.it was familiar. Marc recognized it from somewhere. It was then that the security guards arrived and thwarted us. They became enemies of Knoshu and have all abetted the thief.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know who really stole the book? Who was it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not sure. It&rsquo;s hazy. The night shift.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like the night shift security at the Met?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do they want with the book?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To commit great evil! The luminous moon has conveyed to me dread and doom for the future of New York if the book is not reclaimed.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>Matt Murdock sat silently in the lobby of the jail, as Foggy carried on the pre-arraignment interview with Marc in a secluded visiting area. However, Matt was still able to eavesdrop. Despite Foggy&rsquo;s worries that his attendance at the jail during his partner&rsquo;s interview with Moon Knight would be suspicious, he went to try to gather as much information for himself as he could. Using his heightened senses he tried to decipher Marc&rsquo;s disturbed ramblings, while internally applauding Foggy for his patience.</p><p>Suddenly, he caught a familiar scent on the air. The clack of high-heel boots on ceramic tile-floor carried Misty Knight down the halls of the jail and towards the lobby where he sat. Matt had not seen Misty since his return to Hell&rsquo;s kitchen from San Francisco. He had no idea how the reunion would go, as Misty had been one of the few he had clashed with in the conflict leading up to his departure from his hometown. That was a different time, and he had become something he was not. He was who he was supposed to be now. </p><p>&ldquo;Matt Murdock??!!&rdquo; Misty asked shocked and hurriedly walked over to him.</p><p>Matt braced himself for what would happen, but the woman quickly grabbed him in a hug and squeezed him close.</p><p>&ldquo;Misty. You noticed me.&rdquo; Matt commented.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;d be surprised how much the blind guy actually sticks out in a room. Besides, i was never the one with the problems seeing.&rdquo; Misty joked. Mart could hear a genuine relief to see him. Accelerated heart rate to suggest happiness but signs of concern in her metabolics.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha. How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, all things considered. How are you and when did you get back into New York?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m good. Really good. Thank you so much for asking.&rdquo; Matt took her hand in his and held it for a moment as a gesture of gratitude. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only just recently gotten into an apartment. Seems rent has dropped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Property value went to shit. All these young kids with something to prove want to look cool in front of their friends and shoot up the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gangs?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Something else too.&rdquo; Misty paused for a second, reminded of their surroundings. &ldquo;Why are you here? Did you already manage to get yourself into trouble again?&rdquo;</p><p>As she asked Foggy, having finished the interview with Marc ran into them in the hallway. &ldquo;And Foggy came to bail you out again, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Misty added and laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Mrs. Knight, it&rsquo;s a pleasure.&rdquo; Foggy happily shook Misty&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re here meeting a client.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, i was just following up on some stuff that went down last night. Also needed to talk to Marc Spector.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marc just so happens to be our client.&rdquo; Foggy admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; Misty couldn&rsquo;t believe that not only was Matt Murdock back in hell&rsquo;s kitchen, but was already back in the muck. &ldquo;What were the odds of that?&rdquo; she asked looking directly at Matt.</p><p>&ldquo;Tax records indicate that Marc was once gainfully employed through your company Heroes For Hire inc. Right?&rdquo; Matt asked back.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. He was. But that was some time ago. He hasnt been with us for some time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait? Heroes For Hire is going again?&rdquo; Matt became focused.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they&rsquo;ve been up for a few months now. I actually heard word of it while Misty and i were helping each other during my time with the DA&rsquo;s office.&rdquo; Foggy chimed in. He did not like the way Matt started acting, after hearing about Heroes For Hire.</p><p>&ldquo;We have a contract to return the book, and given the spot he&rsquo;s in now i thought maybe Marc would be able to shed some light on what happened.&rdquo; Misty said.</p><p>&ldquo;Bright guy, That Marc Spector.&rdquo; Foggy said.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always been a little strange, but it always seemed to have a reason to him. Like there really was a method to his madness.&rdquo; Misty responded.</p><p>&ldquo;There just might be. I think he could catch the thief.&rdquo; Matt stated.</p><p>&ldquo;He knows who did it?&rdquo;</p></p>",
