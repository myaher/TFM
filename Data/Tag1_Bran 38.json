Beyond being mad that him being made king <i>came out of nowhere</i>, I find it <i>much more</i>\u00a0interesting to question <b>who</b>\u00a0is Bran and <b>what</b>\u00a0he wants.</p><!-- more --><p>First things first: <b>Bran</b>\u00a0isn\u2019t <b>Bran Stark </b>anymore. Yes, that is his name, it is what he is called, and he is obviously comfortable being home in Winterfell with his doting sisters&hellip; while it suits him. But no, Bran isn\u2019t a Stark anymore, meaning his priorities aren\u2019t the same they were when he was simply Bran Stark.</p><p>In conversation with Jaime, Bran says as much.\u00a0</p><p><b>Jaime:</b>\u00a0I\u2019m not that person anymore. [refering the time he pushed Bran out of the window to protect his and Cersei\u2019s secrets]</p><p><b>Bran:</b>\u00a0You still would be, if you hadn\u2019t pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark.</p><p><b>Jaime:</b>\u00a0You\u2019re not?</p><p><b>Bran:</b>\u00a0No, I\u2019m something else now.</p><p>New Bran does say he still <i>remembers</i>\u00a0being Brandon Stark. He still carries his memories obviously. But then, we have to remember New Bran can <i>remember anyone\u2019s life</i>. Probably not with the personal flair he can remember Bran\u2019s but still.</p><p>So what does New Bran want? There are two conversations with Tyrion that are of interest. In episode 4:</p><p><b>Tyrion:</b>\u00a0You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as the Lord of Winterfell.</p><p><b>Bran:</b> I\u2019m not Lord of Winterfell.</p><p><b>Tyrion:</b>\u00a0You\u2019re the only surviving true born son of Ned Stark. [ there\u2019s a pause here in which Bran just stares at him and Tyrion continues, obviously confused] You don\u2019t want it.</p><p><b>Bran:</b>\u00a0I don\u2019t really want&hellip;anymore.</p><p><b>Tyrion:</b>\u00a0I envy you;</p><p><b>Bran:</b>\u00a0You shouldn\u2019t envy me. Mostly I live in the past.</p><p>And, of course, the infamous dragonpit scene in episode 6:</p><p><b>Tyrion:</b>\u00a0I know you don\u2019t want it. I know you don\u2019t care about power. But I ask you now: if we choose you, will you wear the crown? Will you lead the seven kingdons to the best of your abilities? From this day until your last day?</p><p><b>Bran:</b>\u00a0Why do you think I came all this way?</p><p>And there is the moment where my ears perked. Not because I was outraged because <i>it came out of nowhere</i>\u00a0but because I wanted to understand <b>why</b>\u00a0he said <b>that</b>\u00a0when he also said <b>I don\u2019t want anymore</b>?</p><p>There are other bits of dialogue I find important. When Theon once again apologizes to Bran before the Battle of Winterfell:</p><p><b>Bran:</b>\u00a0Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.\u00a0</p><p>And also that little bit of dilogue with Jon on episode 6:</p><p><b>Jon:</b>\u00a0Your grace, I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there when you needed me.</p><p><b>Bran:</b>\u00a0You were exactly where you were supposed to be.</p><p>[Jon looks confused, as he always does when interacting with Bran and leaves]</p><p>There\u2019s this really cool video about Bran by <b>YouTube\u2019s Joe Magician:</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DO0Y-QOJ9b_c%26t%3D535s\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0Y-QOJ9b_c?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure><p>In it he mentions bits of interview with Isaac (who plays Bran) that I found very relevant as well:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2c310c78cdb2d4cb73341770429f12b/tumblr_inline_prvkocZabv1sv5qzh_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>Bran can, of course choose whatever moments in the past he wants and see them. But the future? It\u2019s never a clear picture. It is also implied you can\u2019t <i>change</i>\u00a0time. When Bran tries calling his father during one of his visits, Ned hears him but can\u2019t see him. When he visits that same scene again, he doesn\u2019t call to him but Ned <i>still</i>\u00a0turns to the same spot where Bran had been standing before as though he could still hear him.Meaning, that was always going to happen.</p><p>I\u2019m assuming here Bran can be slightly manipulative but he does so only with the bits of future information he has. He gives Arya the dagger because he knows she\u2019ll need it even if he doesn\u2019t necessarily know why. When he tells Theon he is home that was also manipulative, he needed to give Theon, someone known for running, motivation to <i>stay</i>\u00a0and protect him. When he tells Jon he was always where he needed to be, it\u2019s not manipulative, but it is fatalistic! Jon played the part he needed to play for the outcome. Remember it was Bran who incited Sam into telling Jon about his true parentage! Why? If in the end it mattered little that Jon was the heir, then why tell him at all? Well because of all the things that needed to happen for us to get to this outcome.</p><p>So yes, Bran is playing a game too, and with an unfair advantage!</p><p>But is Bran evil? I don\u2019t know. I do think he means it when he tells Tyrion he\u00a0\u201cdoesn\u2019t want anymore.\u201d But right at that moment, he still doesn\u2019t know the outcome, he knows some of the steps, some of the chess pieces and where they need to be, but he doesn\u2019t know the ending.\u00a0</p><p>Is Bran being as knowledgeable a being as he is good for everyone? Or bad for everyone? Again that depends on his motivation. Someone who <i>doesn\u2019t</i>\u00a0want things could be a good ruler, because his focus isn\u2019t himself. And I have to question, being that he isn\u2019t truly a Stark anymore, he could have, if he was greedy like other kings, refused Sansa when she declared Northern independence. He could have said\u00a0\u201cno\u201d to her in that moment. He didn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s because she\u2019s his sister - I don\u2019t think Bran truly feels any sort of emotional attachment for his family anyway, not to a great degree anyway. But he listens to her, and after a moment of consideration, he nods.

Remember it was Bran who incited Sam into telling Jon about his true parentage! Why? If in the end it mattered little that Jon was the heir, then why tell him at all? Well because of all the things that needed to happen for us to get to this outcome.</p><p>So yes, Bran is playing a game too, and with an unfair advantage!</p><p>But is Bran evil? I don&rsquo;t know. I do think he means it when he tells Tyrion he&nbsp;&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t want anymore.&rdquo; But right at that moment, he still doesn&rsquo;t know the outcome, he knows some of the steps, some of the chess pieces and where they need to be, but he doesn&rsquo;t know the ending.&nbsp;</p><p>Is Bran being as knowledgeable a being as he is good for everyone? Or bad for everyone? Again that depends on his motivation. Someone who <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i>&nbsp;want things could be a good ruler, because his focus isn&rsquo;t himself. And I have to question, being that he isn&rsquo;t truly a Stark anymore, he could have, if he was greedy like other kings, refused Sansa when she declared Northern independence. He could have said&nbsp;&ldquo;no&rdquo; to her in that moment. He didn&rsquo;t. And I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s his sister - I don&rsquo;t think Bran truly feels any sort of emotional attachment for his family anyway, not to a great degree anyway. But he listens to her, and after a moment of consideration, he nods. Maybe because in his glimpses of a future, an indepedent North exists.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a paradox in Bran, in which he can see the past, he can glimpse the future but he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily wants to lord over what happens. He watches and he thinks, and he moves his pieces, but he&rsquo;s guessing as much as he can. Looking at it through that lens, maybe Bran will be a good king for a time.</p><p>Now could Bran&rsquo;s motivations be wholly dark? I guess they could. I&rsquo;d have to find different moments in the show to see it though.</p><p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my analysis. I see people screaming <i>bad writing</i>&nbsp;at every moment, and look, I agree it&rsquo;s rushed, but to claim <i>nothing</i>&nbsp;makes sense is deliberately not wanting/knowing where to look. Bran is a very intriguing character, and I find his ending fascinating and curious and a little scary!</p>",

Also it seems they could have survived if they were just like 10 feet away so there\u2019s that &hellip;\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion was not on board with her shit and I don\u2019t blame him, she really became what she claimed to detest, a dictator who went around killing people, she claimed to cleanse the world and make it new again and good. She said before she wanted to save innocents and yet went and killed an entire city for no real reason, which also left no one there to rule in King\u2019s Landing and a load of building work to be done again &hellip; didn\u2019t really think that through tbh.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, after Tyrion got locked up by her craziness, it was left up to Jon to do what had to be done.\u00a0</p><p>He was actually pretty slick about him for him, she went in for a kiss and he kissed her back and then stabbed her with his sword. We just heard it then saw her drop to the ground. The out pops Drogon who upon seeing what has happened, uses his fire breath to melt the throne, as I said at the time, knowing it corrupted her and is what truly killed her. Even the dragon could see it &hellip; or it could be as some memes claim and she was killed by something pointy and the chair had them in spades. But no, I think Drogon was actually smarter than that and knew what was up. It was her quest for the throne and absolute power which sent her mad as it did her father and corrupted her and her once beautiful ideals. Because of course, absolute powers causes absolute corruption.</p><p>Then Drogon lovingly picked her up and flew off with her to take her to lay her to rest somewhere I assume. That was pretty sweet of him to do tbh, bless. Even after all that he still cared even if he knew she did bad.\u00a0</p><p>Then fast forward a few weeks later, Grey Worm apparently still hates Jon for killing Dany and wants something done about him and there\u2019s a meeting with all of the heads of the houses or whatever to discuss who will take the Iron Throne.</p><p>Apparently, even being the rightful heir due to his lineage somehow Jon didn\u2019t really even get a look in, like not even from his family. I dunno.</p><p>Tyrion proclaimed that people love a great story and who has a better story than Bran and therefore he should be the King &hellip; the boy who never seemed interested but said\u00a0\u201cwhy do you think I\u2019m here?\u201d because obviously he knew it would happen as he saw it as he did everything. So he could\u2019ve just cut it short with all the crazy and said\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the answer actually\u201d when you think about it. As people pointed out, Jaime the Kingslayer nearly killed the future King 8 seasons ago lol.</p><p>I mean, it makes sense from that perspective I guess. Bran accepted as he knew it was his fate all along. That sneaky bastard.\u00a0</p><p>But Sansa wasn\u2019t having it and said The North would be separate like it once was so she could be Queen there basically. She just didn\u2019t want to rule under her younger brother, so much for like having your families back.\u00a0</p><p>King Bran et al had to discuss how they were going to bankroll and set up bringing the citadel back to life after it was so badly destroyed. Bronn was amusing as the keeper of the money.</p><p>Somehow Jon ended up back where he started at The Night\u2019s Watch &hellip; which I thought there was no longer any need for as weren\u2019t they just meant to watch out for the White Walkers north of the wall? They\u2019re all dead and gone so that would be there\u2019s no need for that whole unit, I said it literally when watching, I was a little confused. I did think that was a bit sad that after he\u2019d come all this way and been King of the North and was the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne that he fell back down to just being a soldier at The Night\u2019s Watch when his watch was meant to be over. I expected him to have a much greater ending after all that, it was kind of a fall back down the Earth. It seems like it wasn\u2019t deserved really. He should have been the King. It just didn\u2019t do his character justice tbh.\u00a0</p><p>Brienne filled in the history books as to what happened and very quickly changed pages and shut the book when surely the ink could not have been dry which many have pointed out. Even if she checked, I don\u2019t buy it could have been dry that quickly. It takes longer than that for that kind of ink.</p><p>Arya did what all teens did and went travelling to find out what isn\u2019t shown on their maps, probably America lol. I bet she\u2019ll discover that or maybe France. I\u2019d love to see Arya\u2019s adventures in France, if it were somewhere real or based on somewhere like that.\u00a0</p><p>Jon and The Night\u2019s Watch either went on Watch or abandoned it as it\u2019s no longer required &hellip; not quite sure which they did.\u00a0</p><p>I did love seeing Jon finally reunite with Ghost properly. It was so cute when he petted him, finally! If that was CGI it was good as it looked so real, although online it says it\u2019s a combo of CGI and footage of real wolves. Ghost looked super real then.\u00a0</p><p>Well, I can\u2019t believe the show is over! I thought it would last a lot more seasons and apparently HBO wanted 10 seasons but I guess the writers wanna go do their Star Wars movies now &hellip; so we got shafted from that point of view tbh.\u00a0</p><p>It also would have been better if George RR Martin had finished the books 4 years ago when they were due so they would have finished the same, although I only have the first one which I didn\u2019t finish but apparently he\u2019s complained about the ending being not what he wanted. It did feel like this season was quite rushed though and it could have been better than it was, also characters completely changed overnight and that was strange. It shouldn\u2019t have happened. I know people started a petition to remake the entire season and I don\u2019t think they\u2019d do that after all the money they just spent on it and the CGI, it could be good to appease the fans but I doubt it\u2019d happen. It could\u2019ve been done better but it is what it is I guess. It could have probably been even worse. So think of it like that.</p><p>I will miss this show as it was one of my favourite shows if not my favourite show while it aired and I was always excited for it when it came on! It won\u2019t be the same any more now it\u2019s over!</p><p>It was a wonderful show with an outstanding cast who all embodied their characters perfectly.</p><p>Kit Harington and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau &lt;3</p>",

She said before she wanted to save innocents and yet went and killed an entire city for no real reason, which also left no one there to rule in King\u2019s Landing and a load of building work to be done again \u2026 didn\u2019t really think that through tbh.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, after Tyrion got locked up by her craziness, it was left up to Jon to do what had to be done.\u00a0</p><p>He was actually pretty slick about him for him, she went in for a kiss and he kissed her back and then stabbed her with his sword. We just heard it then saw her drop to the ground. The out pops Drogon who upon seeing what has happened, uses his fire breath to melt the throne, as I said at the time, knowing it corrupted her and is what truly killed her. Even the dragon could see it \u2026 or it could be as some memes claim and she was killed by something pointy and the chair had them in spades. But no, I think Drogon was actually smarter than that and knew what was up. It was her quest for the throne and absolute power which sent her mad as it did her father and corrupted her and her once beautiful ideals. Because of course, absolute powers causes absolute corruption.</p><p>Then Drogon lovingly picked her up and flew off with her to take her to lay her to rest somewhere I assume. That was pretty sweet of him to do tbh, bless. Even after all that he still cared even if he knew she did bad.\u00a0</p><p>Then fast forward a few weeks later, Grey Worm apparently still hates Jon for killing Dany and wants something done about him and there\u2019s a meeting with all of the heads of the houses or whatever to discuss who will take the Iron Throne.</p><p>Apparently, even being the rightful heir due to his lineage somehow Jon didn\u2019t really even get a look in, like not even from his family. I dunno.</p><p>Tyrion proclaimed that people love a great story and who has a better story than Bran and therefore he should be the King \u2026 the boy who never seemed interested but said\u00a0\u201cwhy do you think I\u2019m here?\u201d because obviously he knew it would happen as he saw it as he did everything. So he could\u2019ve just cut it short with all the crazy and said\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the answer actually\u201d when you think about it. As people pointed out, Jaime the Kingslayer nearly killed the future King 8 seasons ago lol.</p><p>I mean, it makes sense from that perspective I guess. Bran accepted as he knew it was his fate all along. That sneaky bastard.\u00a0</p><p>But Sansa wasn\u2019t having it and said The North would be separate like it once was so she could be Queen there basically. She just didn\u2019t want to rule under her younger brother, so much for like having your families back.\u00a0</p><p>King Bran et al had to discuss how they were going to bankroll and set up bringing the citadel back to life after it was so badly destroyed. Bronn was amusing as the keeper of the money.</p><p>Somehow Jon ended up back where he started at The Night\u2019s Watch \u2026 which I thought there was no longer any need for as weren\u2019t they just meant to watch out for the White Walkers north of the wall? They\u2019re all dead and gone so that would be there\u2019s no need for that whole unit, I said it literally when watching, I was a little confused. I did think that was a bit sad that after he\u2019d come all this way and been King of the North and was the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne that he fell back down to just being a soldier at The Night\u2019s Watch when his watch was meant to be over. I expected him to have a much greater ending after all that, it was kind of a fall back down the Earth. It seems like it wasn\u2019t deserved really. He should have been the King. It just didn\u2019t do his character justice tbh.\u00a0</p><p>Brienne filled in the history books as to what happened and very quickly changed pages and shut the book when surely the ink could not have been dry which many have pointed out. Even if she checked, I don\u2019t buy it could have been dry that quickly. It takes longer than that for that kind of ink.</p><p>Arya did what all teens did and went travelling to find out what isn\u2019t shown on their maps, probably America lol. I bet she\u2019ll discover that or maybe France. I\u2019d love to see Arya\u2019s adventures in France, if it were somewhere real or based on somewhere like that.\u00a0</p><p>Jon and The Night\u2019s Watch either went on Watch or abandoned it as it\u2019s no longer required \u2026 not quite sure which they did.\u00a0</p><p>I did love seeing Jon finally reunite with Ghost properly. It was so cute when he petted him, finally! If that was CGI it was good as it looked so real, although online it says it\u2019s a combo of CGI and footage of real wolves. Ghost looked super real then.\u00a0</p><p>Well, I can\u2019t believe the show is over! I thought it would last a lot more seasons and apparently HBO wanted 10 seasons but I guess the writers wanna go do their Star Wars movies now \u2026 so we got shafted from that point of view tbh.\u00a0</p><p>It also would have been better if George RR Martin had finished the books 4 years ago when they were due so they would have finished the same, although I only have the first one which I didn\u2019t finish but apparently he\u2019s complained about the ending being not what he wanted. It did feel like this season was quite rushed though and it could have been better than it was, also characters completely changed overnight and that was strange. It shouldn\u2019t have happened. I know people started a petition to remake the entire season and I don\u2019t think they\u2019d do that after all the money they just spent on it and the CGI, it could be good to appease the fans but I doubt it\u2019d happen. It could\u2019ve been done better but it is what it is I guess. It could have probably been even worse. So think of it like that.</p><p>I will miss this show as it was one of my favourite shows if not my favourite show while it aired and I was always excited for it when it came on! It won\u2019t be the same any more now it\u2019s over!</p><p>It was a wonderful show with an outstanding cast who all embodied their characters perfectly.</p><p>Kit Harington and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau &lt;3</p>",

She completely destroyed him and he didnt deserve this. And GRRM would do something similar because he says the endgame is the same and that means Jon exiled at the Wall. I am so offended and Jon isnt my fav. Ive cried because of this. I cry a lot as I have a sensitive soul but I dont usually cry in fiction, because you know it\u2019s fiction and it\u2019s not real. Last time was when I watched the little mermaid when i was still 7. I hate it because she left her father. I love a good family story.</p><p>I read and saw Jon\u2019s stuff from the beginning and I was always slightly bored. But he was a decent boy, always tried to do the right thing. He just wanted to be accepted and loved, wished for going back to Winterfell to his family more than anything. It was boring, but wtv. I rolled my eyes at him, always brooding. In the end, some bitch from hell comes and destroys him with some shit abusive romance who was never real, then he gets exiled to a place he was never happy in for doing the right thing which is kill her hitler with tits arse. Im not even going to comment on the rest, I am assuming most of it is D&amp;D creative crap, but that would make it even worse. He was a generic boring boy, why would the author do this to him? In headcanon its fixed like in two weeks. But why? WHY? HE ISNT EVEN MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER AND IM SO UPSET.</p><p>Sansa, alone in Winterfell without a semblance of the girl she was. She wanted to go back home and be with Lady and her family. She is all alone with her bannermen. Who chose her because their preferred king was punished and sent to the wall. She is queen in the north so this is \u00bd of what I wanted for her.</p><p>Arya going in adventures, I like. Its also 1/\u201d of what I wanted for her, to be free to be who she wanted. But she also wanted to go home and be with her family and SHE IS NOT and by sailing east she is saying bye bye for like a decade. Someone who sent half of her time going home and another half trying to Forget what home was, but never managing to.</p><p>Bran is still robot!Bran. I have no idea why people who are fans of him are happy with his ending. Its not Bran. Its the Three Eyes Raven. Bran is like in 5% the corner of his mind. If it was Bran it would be fine. He is not\u2019. The books may be different but he is still surrounded by shit snakes (only Sam is worthy it).</p><p>Theon and Jaime died with 50% of their redemption done.

She is the one I&rsquo;m at most peace with.</p><p><b>What am I supposed to re-read this for?</b> Every time I read Theon being mutilated, I&rsquo;m reminded he dies without happiness? Every time Jon angsts about not being a Stark and that he wishes he was one, how he just wanted his old times back, I&rsquo;m reminded they destroyed him and of his bitter end? Every time Sansa thinks about romance and gets her hopes dashed again and again, I&rsquo;m reminded of her lonely end? Every time Arya thinks about her family and that is what keeps her core intact, I&lsquo;m reminded that her end is leaving her family? Every time Bran is thinking about how he misses his family, I&rsquo;m reminded that he disappears to become someone else. <b>What for?</b></p><h2>I re-read and re-watch LORD OF THE RINGS because it&rsquo;s a good story! It makes me smile. What of ASOIAF / GoT</h2><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2><b>NO!</b></h2></p>",
