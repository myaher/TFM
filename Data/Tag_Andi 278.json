To make it simple, I\u2019ll focus on the Good Hair Crew and their romantic relationships. Also, feel free to add to this too! I\u2019d love to hear everyone else\u2019s thoughts!\u00a0</p><h2>1. Andi</h2><p><b>Quality time:</b></p><p>What I noticed about Andi is that she genuinely just wants to spend time with Jonah. In the beginning, she joined the Space Otters for Jonah. In\u00a0\u201cWere We Ever\u201d, she tells Jonah that he loves Frisbee, whereas she likes it.\u00a0</p><p>After Jonah breaks up with Amber and starts spending more time with Andi, this makes her happy and, of course, believe that they were dating and are boyfriend-girlfriend.\u00a0There\u2019s also the double-date with Buffy and Marty at the virtual reality arcade.\u00a0When Jonah almost didn\u2019t go to the Grease sing-along with her, she was clearly unhappy.\u00a0Her joy at finally going on an actual real date with Jonah at the trampoline building was super clear&hellip;and then she gets upset again when he broke the news that he was leaving.\u00a0</p><p>We even see this with Walker, when he takes her to the art gallery. She was genuinely having a great time and was happy, which further added to her inner conflict about which guy was right for her.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>Gifts:</b></p><p>We know how creative Andi is and how passionate she is with her crafts. The obvious display of this Love Language is the bracelet. She made it for Jonah with her feelings in mind. To her, that\u2019s the symbol of their relationship so when Jonah stopped wearing it, she was rightfully upset. And when he starts wearing it again, it\u2019s symbolic of their relationship starting again. And&hellip; we all saw how Jonah was with gift-giving, but Andi still appreciated the gestures.\u00a0</p><p>Her conflict with her feelings for Jonah and Walker began with that beautiful sketch that Walker made as a gift (sure, he took it back again later, but he left her with those fun polaroids). And, then, later, he gives her the cool shoes.</p><h2>2. Buffy</h2><p><b>Words of Affirmation</b></p><p>We all know Buffy likes getting compliments and praises. She thrives in words of affirmation - when she\u2019s told that she\u2019s the best, that she\u2019s brave, that she\u2019s the fastest, etc.\u00a0</p><p>Marty calls her the fastest girl but then calls himself the fastest boy and their whole relationship revolves around this rivalry and friendly banter that just&hellip; works. Marty\u2019s banter with her have some hidden compliments and praise. And when she makes the basketball team but he didn\u2019t, he told her that he was genuinely happy for her.\u00a0</p><p><b>Acts of Service</b></p><p>I feel like Buffy would also have the Love Language of Acts of Service. The things that stand out in my head are very minor things, so it might not be accurate.</p><p>Marty gets her napkins because he knows that she always gets extra napkins. He willingly banters with her and competes with her because he knows she thrives in it.</p><p>With Jonah, what stands out to me was that arm wrestling scene during the Ren Faire. She shares why she wants to be seen as brave and strong and Jonah challenged her because he knew that she needed it at that moment. And you can tell how grateful Buffy was at that.</p><p>With Walker, he makes that sketch for her of the Good Hair Crew before she moved to Phoenix. Walker, who didn\u2019t know who she was but had come because he wanted to do this for Andi and her friend, that\u2019s really touching and I can see why Cyrus would assume that she had a crush on him.\u00a0</p><h2>3. Cyrus</h2><p><b>Acts of Service</b></p><p>We know the type of person of Cyrus is. He likes doing things for his friends and tries to help them in the best way he could, even though sometimes it can be borderline invasive and meddlesome, but that\u2019s how he shows his love. And, ultimately, we see him like this in his relationship with Iris when he tried to win her prizes during their carnival date.</p><p>And we see this with Jonah, as well. He tries to do so many things for Jonah, like going to his practices and making sure everyone is hydrated. He supports Jonah during his Frisbee tryouts. In turn, his feelings for Jonah were fueled by Jonah being there in important moments of his life, like when he helped him learn how to skateboard and was there to help Cyrus pick out a suit for his Bar Mitzvah.</p><p>With TJ, we were gifted with that beautiful scene of him listening to TJ as he shares the secret about his dyscalculia with him. He invites him to his Bar Mitzvah.He goes out of his way to help TJ and Buffy reconcile by staging that ambush so they could play a one-on-one game. In turn, TJ helps him with his somersault and this happens right before Cyrus realizes that his feelings for Jonah had changed.\u00a0</p><p><b>Physical Touch</b></p><p>I don\u2019t have a lot to say with this but Cyrus did mention to Iris that he liked holding hands. He was also genuinely excited to have gotten his first kiss. We know that he likes hugging Jonah and that was how he determined his feelings for him, with the beating of his heart. And although he and TJ barely touched, except for maybe that one side hug in\u00a0\u201cBuffy In A Bottle\u201d, he and TJ tend to stand pretty close to each other a lot.</p><p>Again, I\u2019m not quite certain if any of these are accurate but that\u2019s how I read into their Love Languages.\u00a0</p><p>If you guys want me to decipher any other characters\u2019 Love Language, feel free to send me an ask!</p>",

                "content": "<p><h1>The Love Language of the &ldquo;Andi Mack&rdquo; characters</h1><p>So&hellip; because I feel so deprived of Andi Mack (DISNEY, RELEASE THE TRAILER YOU COWARDS), I started thinking about the Love Language of the characters.</p><p>if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept, we all have a Love Language. It is the way we show love to our loved one and the way we want to be shown that we are loved. We all have different love languages and relationships (whether it&rsquo;s romantic, platonic, or familial) are successful if you know the other person&rsquo;s Love Language. Some people have one Love Language, some have more.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in knowing what yours is, you can take <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.5lovelanguages.com%2Fprofile%2F&amp;t=YThmZDk0ZjhmZTk3OTEyZDBhNjU1ZWExNzQzNTZjOGY0ZWJlZTlmYSxlMWFjNmVhODE1NWQ2OGE0MjkzZWI5Yjg2ZjhiYzdiNTgwODg5NTA3\">this quiz</a>!</p><p>The 5 Love Languages are:</p><ol><li>Words of affirmation: Using words to build up the other person to show love.&nbsp;</li><li>Gifts: You give the other person gifts.</li><li>Acts of Service: Doing things for the other person.</li><li>Quality time: Spending time with the other person doing things they or both of you enjoy.</li><li>Physical touch: You express love through physical affection like kissing, hand holding, and hugging.</li></ol><p>Now, for the Andi Mack characters. To make it simple, I&rsquo;ll focus on the Good Hair Crew and their romantic relationships. Also, feel free to add to this too! I&rsquo;d love to hear everyone else&rsquo;s thoughts!&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Andi</h2><p><b>Quality time:</b></p><p>What I noticed about Andi is that she genuinely just wants to spend time with Jonah. In the beginning, she joined the Space Otters for Jonah. In&nbsp;&ldquo;Were We Ever&rdquo;, she tells Jonah that he loves Frisbee, whereas she likes it.&nbsp;</p><p>After Jonah breaks up with Amber and starts spending more time with Andi, this makes her happy and, of course, believe that they were dating and are boyfriend-girlfriend.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s also the double-date with Buffy and Marty at the virtual reality arcade.&nbsp;When Jonah almost didn&rsquo;t go to the Grease sing-along with her, she was clearly unhappy.&nbsp;Her joy at finally going on an actual real date with Jonah at the trampoline building was super clear&hellip;and then she gets upset again when he broke the news that he was leaving.&nbsp;</p><p>We even see this with Walker, when he takes her to the art gallery. She was genuinely having a great time and was happy, which further added to her inner conflict about which guy was right for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Gifts:</b></p><p>We know how creative Andi is and how passionate she is with her crafts. The obvious display of this Love Language is the bracelet. She made it for Jonah with her feelings in mind. To her, that&rsquo;s the symbol of their relationship so when Jonah stopped wearing it, she was rightfully upset. And when he starts wearing it again, it&rsquo;s symbolic of their relationship starting again. And&hellip; we all saw how Jonah was with gift-giving, but Andi still appreciated the gestures.&nbsp;</p><p>Her conflict with her feelings for Jonah and Walker began with that beautiful sketch that Walker made as a gift (sure, he took it back again later, but he left her with those fun polaroids). And, then, later, he gives her the cool shoes.</p><h2>2. Buffy</h2><p><b>Words of Affirmation</b></p><p>We all know Buffy likes getting compliments and praises. She thrives in words of affirmation - when she&rsquo;s told that she&rsquo;s the best, that she&rsquo;s brave, that she&rsquo;s the fastest, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Marty calls her the fastest girl but then calls himself the fastest boy and their whole relationship revolves around this rivalry and friendly banter that just&hellip; works. Marty&rsquo;s banter with her have some hidden compliments and praise. And when she makes the basketball team but he didn&rsquo;t, he told her that he was genuinely happy for her.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Acts of Service</b></p><p>I feel like Buffy would also have the Love Language of Acts of Service. The things that stand out in my head are very minor things, so it might not be accurate.</p><p>Marty gets her napkins because he knows that she always gets extra napkins. He willingly banters with her and competes with her because he knows she thrives in it.</p><p>With Jonah, what stands out to me was that arm wrestling scene during the Ren Faire. She shares why she wants to be seen as brave and strong and Jonah challenged her because he knew that she needed it at that moment. And you can tell how grateful Buffy was at that.</p><p>With Walker, he makes that sketch for her of the Good Hair Crew before she moved to Phoenix. Walker, who didn&rsquo;t know who she was but had come because he wanted to do this for Andi and her friend, that&rsquo;s really touching and I can see why Cyrus would assume that she had a crush on him.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Cyrus</h2><p><b>Acts of Service</b></p><p>We know the type of person of Cyrus is. He likes doing things for his friends and tries to help them in the best way he could, even though sometimes it can be borderline invasive and meddlesome, but that&rsquo;s how he shows his love. And, ultimately, we see him like this in his relationship with Iris when he tried to win her prizes during their carnival date.</p><p>And we see this with Jonah, as well. He tries to do so many things for Jonah, like going to his practices and making sure everyone is hydrated. He supports Jonah during his Frisbee tryouts. In turn, his feelings for Jonah were fueled by Jonah being there in important moments of his life, like when he helped him learn how to skateboard and was there to help Cyrus pick out a suit for his Bar Mitzvah.</p><p>With TJ, we were gifted with that beautiful scene of him listening to TJ as he shares the secret about his dyscalculia with him. He invites him to his Bar Mitzvah.He goes out of his way to help TJ and Buffy reconcile by staging that ambush so they could play a one-on-one game. In turn, TJ helps him with his somersault and this happens right before Cyrus realizes that his feelings for Jonah had changed.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Physical Touch</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot to say with this but Cyrus did mention to Iris that he liked holding hands. He was also genuinely excited to have gotten his first kiss. We know that he likes hugging Jonah and that was how he determined his feelings for him, with the beating of his heart. And although he and TJ barely touched, except for maybe that one side hug in&nbsp;&ldquo;Buffy In A Bottle&rdquo;, he and TJ tend to stand pretty close to each other a lot.</p><p>Again, I&rsquo;m not quite certain if any of these are accurate but that&rsquo;s how I read into their Love Languages.&nbsp;</p><p>If you guys want me to decipher any other characters&rsquo; Love Language, feel free to send me an ask!</p></p>",
