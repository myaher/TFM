On the show we see Sansa kneeling, taking the cup and giving it to Tyrion. That small scene, written by GRRM personally, is a significant evidence of how the author sees the relationship between these two characters. They are not enemies, they are not even indifferent, they are allies, they help each other and give each other comfort when they can. They care about each other. And it&rsquo;s not based on passion or lust, as with so many of the relationships in the series, but on mutual understanding, sympathy and kindness.&rdquo; - <b>David Benioff, writer of the series</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b577d66190948bbfd9a4e35849620bbc/tumblr_pnqxtrkcdz1s77hly_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",
