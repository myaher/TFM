Of course he couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p><p>Shinsou rolled over and rubbed his eyes. The darkness of his room did little to aid his insomnia. No matter how dark, no matter how quiet, he would be awake nonetheless.</p><p>Shinsou sighed and stretched his arms above his head. If only there was a quirk that could send him to sleep &ndash; he\u2019d become that user\u2019s best friend. On the bright side, at least it was a weekend. Since he didn\u2019t have to wake up early for school, he could sleep in &ndash; if he ever fell asleep in the first place.</p><p>He turned on his bedside lamp. The light flooded his room and he glanced away to avoid being blinded. At least he had a room to himself. Shinsou didn&rsquo;t have to worry about waking a roommate with his midnight antics.</p><p>His eyes adjusted to the light. If he wasn&rsquo;t going to sleep, he needed to figure out something else to do. But what?</p><p>He&rsquo;d only moved into the 1-A dorms a few weeks ago. It was still hard to believe. He&rsquo;d been admitted into the hero course in their second year, and while he had a lot of catching up to do, he was there nonetheless. It was almost surreal. He\u2019d dreamed of that moment for months, but when it actually happened, he was wholly unprepared.</p><p>Since he\u2019d just moved in, the dorm room was bare. UA provided the essentials &ndash; a bed, desk, cabinets. The only thing Shinsou added was a cork board filled with Polaroid photos. He didn\u2019t consider himself a photography fanatic, but there was something about the timelessness of polaroids that drew his attention. It was more than a photo, it was a moment frozen in time.</p><p>He kept photos of his classmates, even some of himself, and pinned them to the board to remind him why he joined class 1-A.</p><p>Now that his room was illuminated, he could observe each photo. He kept them because of the feeling the pictures gave him &ndash; or was it the feeling the people in them gave him?</p><p>He picked up the first photo. Kaminari stood with his arm slung around Shinsou\u2019s shoulders. Kaminari wore Shinsou\u2019s speaker around his mouth and a scarf around his neck. Shinsou had Kaminari\u2019s jacket around his arms. They\u2019d traded costumes for the day.</p><p>Shinsou smiled faintly. The speaker around Kaminari\u2019s mouth was more like a muzzle. Shinsou refused to show him how to use it, so each word from Kaminari&rsquo;s mouth came out muffled and faint. It was one of the few times Shinsou had seen him be completely silent. It was nice, but he quickly grew to miss the chatter.</p><p>The leather jacket had stuck to his skin and the shooters around his wrists weighed him down. How did Kaminari move like that? Shinsou could hardly fight properly with them.</p><p>He put a picture back and pulled up another one.</p><p>Shinsou wasn&rsquo;t sure who had taken it. One of their classmates, for sure. It was candid &ndash; neither of them were aware the photo was taken. A student must have dug the camera out of Shinsou\u2019s bag while they were training.</p><p>It was some kind of partner exercise. It was early in the year, so Shinsou couldn&rsquo;t recall the exact event. Kaminari stood back to back with him, electricity pulsing through his fingertips. Shinsou stared at something off a frame, already tugging at the ropes around his neck. Kaminari seemed to be saying something, but Shinsou couldn&rsquo;t remember what.</p><p>No, he couldn&rsquo;t remember what they were doing or what was said, but he could remember how it made him feel. Kaminari covering him, watching his back. For the first time in a long time, Shinsou felt&hellip;safe. Like there was someone he could trust.</p><p>It was usually a rare feeling for him, but not when he was around Kaminari.</p><!-- more --><p>One more photo caught his attention.</p><p>They\u2019d all had the day off for a teacher\u2019s work day. Despite Aizawa\u2019s objections, Nedzu allowed the students to leave campus. The entirety of class 1-A packed into a bus and rode to the beach &ndash; with the exception of Mineta, whose invitation had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>Somehow, Shinsou was roped into playing a game of chicken fight. He still wasn&rsquo;t sure how that had happened. He only vaguely remembered Kaminari grabbing his arm and begging for Shinsou to join.</p><p>Kaminari teamed up with Sero, leaving Shinsou with Kirishima. Not a bad choice in partners, but Shinsou wished he could have paired with Kaminari instead of fighting against him.</p><p>The photo was taken seconds before they hit the water. Shinsou\u2019s hands were locked on Kaminari\u2019s shoulders, who in turn had clasped Shinsou\u2019s elbows. They wore identical smiles. Kaminari\u2019s hair was wet, dripping over his eyes.</p><p>If Shinsou remembered correctly, they\u2019d hit the water at the same time, making the fight a draw.</p><p>He put the pictures back, sure to pin them in place so they didn&rsquo;t fall.</p><p>At least he felt better, though he still couldn\u2019t sleep. He picked his camera off his nightstand and tossed it between his hands. Maybe he should take a walk around campus. There could be something new or exciting for him to take a picture of.</p><p>He threw a jacket on and opened the door.</p><p>Since he lived near the end of the hall, he\u2019d have to cross the common room before he could leave. Hopefully, he didn&rsquo;t run into anyone who\u2019d try to stop him or ask questions. He only just joined the hero course &ndash; he couldn\u2019t start making enemies with his teachers so soon.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>He made it a few feet before he saw the light burning in the common room. It was faint, tinted blue, as if someone was using their phone. Shinsou peered around the corner, staying as hidden as he could. If it was a teacher, he\u2019d get in trouble for sneaking out. Not just any trouble, either, but kicked-out-of-the-class-he-worked-so-hard-for trouble.</p><p>\u201cOh. Hey. What\u2019re you doing up?\u201d</p><p>Shinsou stiffened. Dammit. He needed to work on a lot of skills to be on par with the 1-A kids. It seemed stealth should be at the top of his list.</p><p>The student lifted their head over the couch, revealing Kaminari\u2019s black-striped hair. Shinsou relaxed, exhaling.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Shinsou said. He pushed away from the corner and made his way into the common room. \u201cAny teachers around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s Vlad King\u2019s turn to watch the dorms tonight. He sleeps like a rock.\u201d Kaminari said. He sat up, revealing a long white wire. Earbuds. The light Shinsou saw must have been from Kaminari\u2019s iPod.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNightmares,\u201d Kaminari settled back down into the couch, trying too hard to seem nonchalant. The crack in his voice gave him away.</p><p>\u201cFrom the summer camp?\u201d Shinsou asked, taking a seat across from him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cThe USJ attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Sometimes Shinsou forgot the first attack took place. Everything happened so fast that it faded from the news before anyone could stop it.</p><p>\u201cI avoided the worst of it during the summer camp since I was inside the entire time. But USJ? Front lines, baby, front lines.\u201d</p><p>Kaminari trailed off, hyper-focusing his attention to his music. He skipped a few songs before he was satisfied. \u201cI remember electrocuting too many villains to count. And then,\u201d he waved his hands haphazardly. \u201cI short-circuited. Couldn&rsquo;t do anything. Couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t think. But I could still feel.\u201d Kaminari tapped his chest, right above his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhen another villain and grabbed me from behind&hellip;nothing I could do to stop it. But I still felt the fear. No, it was more than fear. It was helplessness. Knowing I was in danger &ndash; that my friends were in danger &ndash; and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it feels like,\u201d Shinsou mumbled</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll never have to,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cWhat about you? What\u2019s keeping you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral feelings,\u201d Shinsou said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid there&rsquo;s too many of those going around.\u201d Kaminari snorted. He held up the iPod. \u201cWant to listen? It\u2019s my night-time playlist. Effects have mostly worn off on me, but maybe you\u2019ll find something that helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe earbuds aren\u2019t long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Kaminari squished himself further back into the couch. \u201cCome sit.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cOk,\u201d he said. \u201cOk.\u201d</p><p>He climbed onto the cushions beside Kaminari. Even if Kaminari moved over, the couch wasn&rsquo;t big enough for both of them. Not by a long shot. Kaminari\u2019s legs pressed against his. The couch beneath him was still warm.</p><p>Kaminari shifted onto his side to face Shinsou. \u201cHere,\u201d he pulled an earbud loose and handed it over. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not too loud. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou accepted it.</p><p>Kaminari\u2019s \u2018night-time\u2019 playlist was nothing Shinsou had expected from him. The music was soft, gentle. Slow, even. \u201cWhat artist is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVance Joy,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cBut there\u2019s more on here than just him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusic is a universal language.\u201d Kaminari\u2019s voice was barely a whisper. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you come from or where you go. A note is still a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice to have something that absolute in your life,\u201d Shinsou noted.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou closed his eyes and tried to see the music the way Kaminari saw it. To feel it. To hear it as a language spoken across borders.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t focus on the song.</p><p>How could he? Even with his eyes closed, he could feel Kaminari\u2019s gaze on him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shinsou asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything in your life that\u2019s&hellip;how\u2019d you put it? Absolute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shinsou answered a little too quickly; he wasn\u2019t methodical enough to remove the bitterness from his voice. \u201cNothing,\u201d he amended, trying to sound lighter.</p><p>Kaminari didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cNot even a person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I did,\u201d Shinsou said. \u201cBut they come and go so fast they\u2019re hardly temporary, much less absolute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there was someone who didn\u2019t leave you?\u201d Kaminari asked. \u201cWould you feel absolute then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Shinsou said. \u201cBut I doubt I\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Kaminari shifted, lifting his gaze away. Something in his voice sounded different, but Shinsou couldn\u2019t tell what. \u201cJust listen to the music. Maybe you&rsquo;ll fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou took a deep breath and tried again to listen to the music like Kaminari. To feel the beat in his fingertips, the life in its words.</p><p>Before long, he was asleep.</p><p>He woke up to someone scraping across the floor on their way to the bathroom. He opened his eyes and blinked away the light flooding his vision. Kaminari was long gone &ndash; his side of the couch was cold.</p><p>In his place, Kaminari had tucked the second earbud into Shinsou\u2019s ear. On the coffee table in front of him, Shinsou\u2019s polaroid camera lay on its side and next to it, a single photo; Shinsou, asleep on the couch, illuminated by the glow of the iPod.</p><p>Scrawled across the bottom in Kaminari&rsquo;s sloppy handwriting read; Absolute.</p>",

He\u2019d dreamed of that moment for months, but when it actually happened, he was wholly unprepared.</p><p>Since he\u2019d just moved in, the dorm room was bare. UA provided the essentials \u2013 a bed, desk, cabinets. The only thing Shinsou added was a cork board filled with Polaroid photos. He didn\u2019t consider himself a photography fanatic, but there was something about the timelessness of polaroids that drew his attention. It was more than a photo, it was a moment frozen in time.</p><p>He kept photos of his classmates, even some of himself, and pinned them to the board to remind him why he joined class 1-A.</p><p>Now that his room was illuminated, he could observe each photo. He kept them because of the feeling the pictures gave him \u2013 or was it the feeling the people in them gave him?</p><p>He picked up the first photo. Kaminari stood with his arm slung around Shinsou\u2019s shoulders. Kaminari wore Shinsou\u2019s speaker around his mouth and a scarf around his neck. Shinsou had Kaminari\u2019s jacket around his arms. They\u2019d traded costumes for the day.</p><p>Shinsou smiled faintly. The speaker around Kaminari\u2019s mouth was more like a muzzle. Shinsou refused to show him how to use it, so each word from Kaminari\u2019s mouth came out muffled and faint. It was one of the few times Shinsou had seen him be completely silent. It was nice, but he quickly grew to miss the chatter.</p><p>The leather jacket had stuck to his skin and the shooters around his wrists weighed him down. How did Kaminari move like that? Shinsou could hardly fight properly with them.</p><p>He put a picture back and pulled up another one.</p><p>Shinsou wasn\u2019t sure who had taken it. One of their classmates, for sure. It was candid \u2013 neither of them were aware the photo was taken. A student must have dug the camera out of Shinsou\u2019s bag while they were training.</p><p>It was some kind of partner exercise. It was early in the year, so Shinsou couldn\u2019t recall the exact event. Kaminari stood back to back with him, electricity pulsing through his fingertips. Shinsou stared at something off a frame, already tugging at the ropes around his neck. Kaminari seemed to be saying something, but Shinsou couldn\u2019t remember what.</p><p>No, he couldn\u2019t remember what they were doing or what was said, but he could remember how it made him feel. Kaminari covering him, watching his back. For the first time in a long time, Shinsou felt\u2026safe. Like there was someone he could trust.</p><p>It was usually a rare feeling for him, but not when he was around Kaminari.</p>[[MORE]]<p>One more photo caught his attention.</p><p>They\u2019d all had the day off for a teacher\u2019s work day. Despite Aizawa\u2019s objections, Nedzu allowed the students to leave campus. The entirety of class 1-A packed into a bus and rode to the beach \u2013 with the exception of Mineta, whose invitation had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>Somehow, Shinsou was roped into playing a game of chicken fight. He still wasn\u2019t sure how that had happened. He only vaguely remembered Kaminari grabbing his arm and begging for Shinsou to join.</p><p>Kaminari teamed up with Sero, leaving Shinsou with Kirishima. Not a bad choice in partners, but Shinsou wished he could have paired with Kaminari instead of fighting against him.</p><p>The photo was taken seconds before they hit the water. Shinsou\u2019s hands were locked on Kaminari\u2019s shoulders, who in turn had clasped Shinsou\u2019s elbows. They wore identical smiles. Kaminari\u2019s hair was wet, dripping over his eyes.</p><p>If Shinsou remembered correctly, they\u2019d hit the water at the same time, making the fight a draw.</p><p>He put the pictures back, sure to pin them in place so they didn\u2019t fall.</p><p>At least he felt better, though he still couldn\u2019t sleep. He picked his camera off his nightstand and tossed it between his hands. Maybe he should take a walk around campus. There could be something new or exciting for him to take a picture of.</p><p>He threw a jacket on and opened the door.</p><p>Since he lived near the end of the hall, he\u2019d have to cross the common room before he could leave. Hopefully, he didn\u2019t run into anyone who\u2019d try to stop him or ask questions. He only just joined the hero course \u2013 he couldn\u2019t start making enemies with his teachers so soon.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>He made it a few feet before he saw the light burning in the common room. It was faint, tinted blue, as if someone was using their phone. Shinsou peered around the corner, staying as hidden as he could. If it was a teacher, he\u2019d get in trouble for sneaking out. Not just any trouble, either, but kicked-out-of-the-class-he-worked-so-hard-for trouble.</p><p>\u201cOh. Hey. What\u2019re you doing up?\u201d</p><p>Shinsou stiffened. Dammit. He needed to work on a lot of skills to be on par with the 1-A kids. It seemed stealth should be at the top of his list.</p><p>The student lifted their head over the couch, revealing Kaminari\u2019s black-striped hair. Shinsou relaxed, exhaling.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Shinsou said. He pushed away from the corner and made his way into the common room. \u201cAny teachers around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s Vlad King\u2019s turn to watch the dorms tonight. He sleeps like a rock.\u201d Kaminari said. He sat up, revealing a long white wire. Earbuds. The light Shinsou saw must have been from Kaminari\u2019s iPod.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNightmares,\u201d Kaminari settled back down into the couch, trying too hard to seem nonchalant. The crack in his voice gave him away.</p><p>\u201cFrom the summer camp?\u201d Shinsou asked, taking a seat across from him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cThe USJ attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Sometimes Shinsou forgot the first attack took place. Everything happened so fast that it faded from the news before anyone could stop it.</p><p>\u201cI avoided the worst of it during the summer camp since I was inside the entire time. But USJ? Front lines, baby, front lines.\u201d</p><p>Kaminari trailed off, hyper-focusing his attention to his music. He skipped a few songs before he was satisfied. \u201cI remember electrocuting too many villains to count. And then,\u201d he waved his hands haphazardly. \u201cI short-circuited. Couldn\u2019t do anything. Couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t think. But I could still feel.\u201d Kaminari tapped his chest, right above his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhen another villain and grabbed me from behind\u2026nothing I could do to stop it. But I still felt the fear. No, it was more than fear. It was helplessness. Knowing I was in danger \u2013 that my friends were in danger \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it feels like,\u201d Shinsou mumbled</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll never have to,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cWhat about you? What\u2019s keeping you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral feelings,\u201d Shinsou said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s too many of those going around.\u201d Kaminari snorted. He held up the iPod. \u201cWant to listen? It\u2019s my night-time playlist. Effects have mostly worn off on me, but maybe you\u2019ll find something that helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe earbuds aren\u2019t long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Kaminari squished himself further back into the couch. \u201cCome sit.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cOk,\u201d he said. \u201cOk.\u201d</p><p>He climbed onto the cushions beside Kaminari. Even if Kaminari moved over, the couch wasn\u2019t big enough for both of them. Not by a long shot. Kaminari\u2019s legs pressed against his. The couch beneath him was still warm.</p><p>Kaminari shifted onto his side to face Shinsou. \u201cHere,\u201d he pulled an earbud loose and handed it over. \u201cIt\u2019s not too loud. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou accepted it.</p><p>Kaminari\u2019s \u2018night-time\u2019 playlist was nothing Shinsou had expected from him. The music was soft, gentle. Slow, even. \u201cWhat artist is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVance Joy,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cBut there\u2019s more on here than just him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusic is a universal language.\u201d Kaminari\u2019s voice was barely a whisper. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you come from or where you go. A note is still a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice to have something that absolute in your life,\u201d Shinsou noted.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou closed his eyes and tried to see the music the way Kaminari saw it. To feel it. To hear it as a language spoken across borders.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t focus on the song.</p><p>How could he? Even with his eyes closed, he could feel Kaminari\u2019s gaze on him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shinsou asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything in your life that\u2019s\u2026how\u2019d you put it? Absolute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shinsou answered a little too quickly; he wasn\u2019t methodical enough to remove the bitterness from his voice. \u201cNothing,\u201d he amended, trying to sound lighter.</p><p>Kaminari didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cNot even a person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I did,\u201d Shinsou said. \u201cBut they come and go so fast they\u2019re hardly temporary, much less absolute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there was someone who didn\u2019t leave you?\u201d Kaminari asked. \u201cWould you feel absolute then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Shinsou said. \u201cBut I doubt I\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Kaminari shifted, lifting his gaze away. Something in his voice sounded different, but Shinsou couldn\u2019t tell what. \u201cJust listen to the music. Maybe you\u2019ll fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou took a deep breath and tried again to listen to the music like Kaminari. To feel the beat in his fingertips, the life in its words.</p><p>Before long, he was asleep.</p><p>He woke up to someone scraping across the floor on their way to the bathroom. He opened his eyes and blinked away the light flooding his vision. Kaminari was long gone \u2013 his side of the couch was cold.</p><p>In his place, Kaminari had tucked the second earbud into Shinsou\u2019s ear. On the coffee table in front of him, Shinsou\u2019s polaroid camera lay on its side and next to it, a single photo; Shinsou, asleep on the couch, illuminated by the glow of the iPod.</p><p>Scrawled across the bottom in Kaminari\u2019s sloppy handwriting read; Absolute.</p></p>",

When he was in General Studies, no one understood why someone like him had insomnia. \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d They\u2019d pry. Shinsou never told them. It wasn\u2019t worth explaining to someone who wouldn\u2019t understand. But when insomnia strikes an hour past midnight, Shinsou ventures into the common room, seeking a distraction.</p><p>That distraction happens to be named Kaminari Denki, and unlike the General Studies class, he has insomnia too.</p><p><b>Notes:\u00a0</b>Heavily inspired by the song \u2018Polaroid\u2019 by Imagine Dragons and some art by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mabPbwdgkWoKH6qsUJ3T0oA\">@noerher</a>.

Of course he couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Shinsou rolled over and rubbed his eyes. The darkness of his room did little to aid his insomnia. No matter how dark, no matter how quiet, he would be awake nonetheless.</p><p>Shinsou sighed and stretched his arms above his head. If only there was a quirk that could send him to sleep \u2013 he\u2019d become that user\u2019s best friend. On the bright side, at least it was a weekend. Since he didn\u2019t have to wake up early for school, he could sleep in \u2013 if he ever fell asleep in the first place.</p><p>He turned on his bedside lamp. The light flooded his room and he glanced away to avoid being blinded. At least he had a room to himself. Shinsou didn\u2019t have to worry about waking a roommate with his midnight antics.</p><p>His eyes adjusted to the light.

The couch beneath him was still warm.</p><p>Kaminari shifted onto his side to face Shinsou. \u201cHere,\u201d he pulled an earbud loose and handed it over. \u201cIt\u2019s not too loud.

To feel it. To hear it as a language spoken across borders.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t focus on the song.</p><p>How could he? Even with his eyes closed, he could feel Kaminari\u2019s gaze on him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shinsou asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything in your life that\u2019s\u2026how\u2019d you put it? Absolute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shinsou answered a little too quickly; he wasn\u2019t methodical enough to remove the bitterness from his voice. \u201cNothing,\u201d he amended, trying to sound lighter.</p><p>Kaminari didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cNot even a person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I did,\u201d Shinsou said. \u201cBut they come and go so fast they\u2019re hardly temporary, much less absolute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there was someone who didn\u2019t leave you?\u201d Kaminari asked. \u201cWould you feel absolute then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Shinsou said. \u201cBut I doubt I\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Kaminari shifted, lifting his gaze away. Something in his voice sounded different, but Shinsou couldn\u2019t tell what. \u201cJust listen to the music. Maybe you\u2019ll fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Shinsou took a deep breath and tried again to listen to the music like Kaminari. To feel the beat in his fingertips, the life in its words.</p><p>Before long, he was asleep.</p><p>He woke up to someone scraping across the floor on their way to the bathroom.

Of course he couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p><p>Shinsou rolled over and rubbed his eyes. The darkness of his room did little to aid his insomnia. No matter how dark, no matter how quiet, he would be awake nonetheless.</p><p>Shinsou sighed and stretched his arms above his head. If only there was a quirk that could send him to sleep &ndash; he&rsquo;d become that user&rsquo;s best friend. On the bright side, at least it was a weekend. Since he didn&rsquo;t have to wake up early for school, he could sleep in &ndash; if he ever fell asleep in the first place.</p><p>He turned on his bedside lamp. The light flooded his room and he glanced away to avoid being blinded. At least he had a room to himself. Shinsou didn&rsquo;t have to worry about waking a roommate with his midnight antics.</p><p>His eyes adjusted to the light. If he wasn&rsquo;t going to sleep, he needed to figure out something else to do. But what?</p><p>He&rsquo;d only moved into the 1-A dorms a few weeks ago. It was still hard to believe. He&rsquo;d been admitted into the hero course in their second year, and while he had a lot of catching up to do, he was there nonetheless. It was almost surreal. He&rsquo;d dreamed of that moment for months, but when it actually happened, he was wholly unprepared.</p><p>Since he&rsquo;d just moved in, the dorm room was bare. UA provided the essentials &ndash; a bed, desk, cabinets. The only thing Shinsou added was a cork board filled with Polaroid photos. He didn&rsquo;t consider himself a photography fanatic, but there was something about the timelessness of polaroids that drew his attention. It was more than a photo, it was a moment frozen in time.</p><p>He kept photos of his classmates, even some of himself, and pinned them to the board to remind him why he joined class 1-A.</p><p>Now that his room was illuminated, he could observe each photo. He kept them because of the feeling the pictures gave him &ndash; or was it the feeling the people in them gave him?</p><p>He picked up the first photo. Kaminari stood with his arm slung around Shinsou&rsquo;s shoulders. Kaminari wore Shinsou&rsquo;s speaker around his mouth and a scarf around his neck. Shinsou had Kaminari&rsquo;s jacket around his arms. They&rsquo;d traded costumes for the day.</p><p>Shinsou smiled faintly. The speaker around Kaminari&rsquo;s mouth was more like a muzzle. Shinsou refused to show him how to use it, so each word from Kaminari&rsquo;s mouth came out muffled and faint. It was one of the few times Shinsou had seen him be completely silent. It was nice, but he quickly grew to miss the chatter.</p><p>The leather jacket had stuck to his skin and the shooters around his wrists weighed him down. How did Kaminari move like that? Shinsou could hardly fight properly with them.</p><p>He put a picture back and pulled up another one.</p><p>Shinsou wasn&rsquo;t sure who had taken it. One of their classmates, for sure. It was candid &ndash; neither of them were aware the photo was taken. A student must have dug the camera out of Shinsou&rsquo;s bag while they were training.</p><p>It was some kind of partner exercise. It was early in the year, so Shinsou couldn&rsquo;t recall the exact event. Kaminari stood back to back with him, electricity pulsing through his fingertips. Shinsou stared at something off a frame, already tugging at the ropes around his neck. Kaminari seemed to be saying something, but Shinsou couldn&rsquo;t remember what.</p><p>No, he couldn&rsquo;t remember what they were doing or what was said, but he could remember how it made him feel. Kaminari covering him, watching his back. For the first time in a long time, Shinsou felt&hellip;safe. Like there was someone he could trust.</p><p>It was usually a rare feeling for him, but not when he was around Kaminari.</p><p>One more photo caught his attention.</p><p>They&rsquo;d all had the day off for a teacher&rsquo;s work day. Despite Aizawa&rsquo;s objections, Nedzu allowed the students to leave campus. The entirety of class 1-A packed into a bus and rode to the beach &ndash; with the exception of Mineta, whose invitation had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>Somehow, Shinsou was roped into playing a game of chicken fight. He still wasn&rsquo;t sure how that had happened. He only vaguely remembered Kaminari grabbing his arm and begging for Shinsou to join.</p><p>Kaminari teamed up with Sero, leaving Shinsou with Kirishima. Not a bad choice in partners, but Shinsou wished he could have paired with Kaminari instead of fighting against him.</p><p>The photo was taken seconds before they hit the water. Shinsou&rsquo;s hands were locked on Kaminari&rsquo;s shoulders, who in turn had clasped Shinsou&rsquo;s elbows. They wore identical smiles. Kaminari&rsquo;s hair was wet, dripping over his eyes.</p><p>If Shinsou remembered correctly, they&rsquo;d hit the water at the same time, making the fight a draw.</p><p>He put the pictures back, sure to pin them in place so they didn&rsquo;t fall.</p><p>At least he felt better, though he still couldn&rsquo;t sleep. He picked his camera off his nightstand and tossed it between his hands. Maybe he should take a walk around campus. There could be something new or exciting for him to take a picture of.</p><p>He threw a jacket on and opened the door.</p><p>Since he lived near the end of the hall, he&rsquo;d have to cross the common room before he could leave. Hopefully, he didn&rsquo;t run into anyone who&rsquo;d try to stop him or ask questions. He only just joined the hero course &ndash; he couldn&rsquo;t start making enemies with his teachers so soon.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>He made it a few feet before he saw the light burning in the common room. It was faint, tinted blue, as if someone was using their phone. Shinsou peered around the corner, staying as hidden as he could. If it was a teacher, he&rsquo;d get in trouble for sneaking out. Not just any trouble, either, but kicked-out-of-the-class-he-worked-so-hard-for trouble.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Hey. What&rsquo;re you doing up?&rdquo;</p><p>Shinsou stiffened. Dammit. He needed to work on a lot of skills to be on par with the 1-A kids. It seemed stealth should be at the top of his list.</p><p>The student lifted their head over the couch, revealing Kaminari&rsquo;s black-striped hair. Shinsou relaxed, exhaling.</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; Shinsou said. He pushed away from the corner and made his way into the common room. &ldquo;Any teachers around?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s Vlad King&rsquo;s turn to watch the dorms tonight. He sleeps like a rock.&rdquo; Kaminari said. He sat up, revealing a long white wire. Earbuds. The light Shinsou saw must have been from Kaminari&rsquo;s iPod.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nightmares,&rdquo; Kaminari settled back down into the couch, trying too hard to seem nonchalant. The crack in his voice gave him away.</p><p>&ldquo;From the summer camp?&rdquo; Shinsou asked, taking a seat across from him.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Kaminari said. &ldquo;The USJ attack.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right.&rdquo; Sometimes Shinsou forgot the first attack took place. Everything happened so fast that it faded from the news before anyone could stop it.</p><p>&ldquo;I avoided the worst of it during the summer camp since I was inside the entire time. But USJ? Front lines, baby, front lines.&rdquo;</p><p>Kaminari trailed off, hyper-focusing his attention to his music. He skipped a few songs before he was satisfied. &ldquo;I remember electrocuting too many villains to count. And then,&rdquo; he waved his hands haphazardly. &ldquo;I short-circuited. Couldn&rsquo;t do anything. Couldn&rsquo;t move. Couldn&rsquo;t think. But I could still feel.&rdquo; Kaminari tapped his chest, right above his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;When another villain and grabbed me from behind&hellip;nothing I could do to stop it. But I still felt the fear. No, it was more than fear. It was helplessness. Knowing I was in danger &ndash; that my friends were in danger &ndash; and I couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what it feels like,&rdquo; Shinsou mumbled</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re lucky, you&rsquo;ll never have to,&rdquo; Kaminari said. &ldquo;What about you? What&rsquo;s keeping you up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;General feelings,&rdquo; Shinsou said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s too many of those going around.&rdquo; Kaminari snorted. He held up the iPod. &ldquo;Want to listen? It&rsquo;s my night-time playlist. Effects have mostly worn off on me, but maybe you&rsquo;ll find something that helps.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The earbuds aren&rsquo;t long enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Kaminari squished himself further back into the couch. &ldquo;Come sit.&rdquo;</p><p>Shinsou&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat. &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;</p><p>He climbed onto the cushions beside Kaminari.

The band played their hearts out and the act\nliterally opened with a bang thanks to the resident human incendiary device on\ndrums. The dancers did their thing, and Aoyama played the role of both\nfireworks and disco ball. Sero, Mineta, and Todoroki combined their quirks to create paths of ice over the audience\u2019s heads. Momo then shot out a bunch of confetti, and Ochako dove into the crowd and floated a bunch of people to\nhave a dance party in mid-air. Iida doing the robot was the highlight of the chapter and indeed the whole manga, but Jirou was a close second, with\nan adorable flashback to when she first told her parents she wanted to be a\nhero instead of a musician, and they were the most supportive EVER, and it was\namazing. Even the surly upperclassmen were won over by class A\u2019s general vibe\nof awesomeness, and everyone danced their hearts out, and Eri was THRILLED and her smile was brighter than the sun and\nMirio cried and oh my gosh you guys. I just feel bad for the rest of the\nclasses that have to follow this act now lmao.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Class 1-B puts on the most audacious fanfiction-turned-stage-play since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. All Might informs Deku that he has 47 missed calls and next time would it kill him to PICK UP HIS GODDAMN CELL PHONE jesus christ. Hounddog rips Deku a new one and tells him to be more careful in the future and throws him 20 feet into the air and tells him to go have fun. Eri is so fucking cute that I almost burst into tears just from how cute she is. The surly upperclassmen apologize for their shit attitudes and vow to spread the word of how class 1-A is actually really fucking cool. Kendou, Kenranzaki, and Hadou battle it out for the Miss Con title and Hadou finally wins the title after three years. The kids enjoy the rest of the festival, and Deku gives Eri a homemade candy apple before bidding her farewell. Down at the station, a nice gorilla man sits with with the detailed Gentle and Aiba. Gentle explains that Aiba was never directly involved in any crimes and accepts responsibility for his misdeeds, thus taking his first steps towards rehabilitation.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

The band played their hearts out and the act\nliterally opened with a bang thanks to the resident human incendiary device on\ndrums. The dancers did their thing, and Aoyama played the role of both\nfireworks and disco ball. Sero, Mineta, and Todoroki combined their quirks to create paths of ice over the audience\u2019s heads. Momo then shot out a bunch of confetti, and Ochako dove into the crowd and floated a bunch of people to\nhave a dance party in mid-air. Iida doing the robot was the highlight of the chapter and indeed the whole manga, but Jirou was a close second, with\nan adorable flashback to when she first told her parents she wanted to be a\nhero instead of a musician, and they were the most supportive EVER, and it was\namazing. Even the surly upperclassmen were won over by class A\u2019s general vibe\nof awesomeness, and everyone danced their hearts out, and Eri was THRILLED and her smile was brighter than the sun and\nMirio cried and oh my gosh you guys. I just feel bad for the rest of the\nclasses that have to follow this act now lmao.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Class 1-B puts on the most audacious fanfiction-turned-stage-play since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. All Might informs Deku that he has 47 missed calls and next time would it kill him to PICK UP HIS GODDAMN CELL PHONE jesus christ. Hounddog rips Deku a new one and tells him to be more careful in the future and throws him 20 feet into the air and tells him to go have fun. Eri is so fucking cute that I almost burst into tears just from how cute she is. The surly upperclassmen apologize for their shit attitudes and vow to spread the word of how class 1-A is actually really fucking cool. Kendou, Kenranzaki, and Hadou battle it out for the Miss Con title and Hadou finally wins the title after three years. The kids enjoy the rest of the festival, and Deku gives Eri a homemade candy apple before bidding her farewell. Down at the station, a nice gorilla man sits with with the detailed Gentle and Aiba. Gentle explains that Aiba was never directly involved in any crimes and accepts responsibility for his misdeeds, thus taking his first steps towards rehabilitation.</p><p><br></p><p>\n\n(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

The band played their hearts out and the act\nliterally opened with a bang thanks to the resident human incendiary device on\ndrums. The dancers did their thing, and Aoyama played the role of both\nfireworks and disco ball. Sero, Mineta, and Todoroki combined their quirks to create paths of ice over the audience&rsquo;s heads. Momo then shot out a bunch of confetti, and Ochako dove into the crowd and floated a bunch of people to\nhave a dance party in mid-air. Iida doing the robot was the highlight of the chapter and indeed the whole manga, but Jirou was a close second, with\nan adorable flashback to when she first told her parents she wanted to be a\nhero instead of a musician, and they were the most supportive EVER, and it was\namazing. Even the surly upperclassmen were won over by class A&rsquo;s general vibe\nof awesomeness, and everyone danced their hearts out, and Eri was THRILLED and her smile was brighter than the sun and\nMirio cried and oh my gosh you guys. I just feel bad for the rest of the\nclasses that have to follow this act now lmao.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Class 1-B puts on the most audacious fanfiction-turned-stage-play since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. All Might informs Deku that he has 47 missed calls and next time would it kill him to PICK UP HIS GODDAMN CELL PHONE jesus christ. Hounddog rips Deku a new one and tells him to be more careful in the future and throws him 20 feet into the air and tells him to go have fun. Eri is so fucking cute that I almost burst into tears just from how cute she is. The surly upperclassmen apologize for their shit attitudes and vow to spread the word of how class 1-A is actually really fucking cool. Kendou, Kenranzaki, and Hadou battle it out for the Miss Con title and Hadou finally wins the title after three years. The kids enjoy the rest of the festival, and Deku gives Eri a homemade candy apple before bidding her farewell. Down at the station, a nice gorilla man sits with with the detailed Gentle and Aiba. Gentle explains that Aiba was never directly involved in any crimes and accepts responsibility for his misdeeds, thus taking his first steps towards rehabilitation.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nClass 1-A brought the fucking house down. The band played their hearts out and the act\nliterally opened with a bang thanks to the resident human incendiary device on\ndrums. The dancers did their thing, and Aoyama played the role of both\nfireworks and disco ball. Sero, Mineta, and Todoroki combined their quirks to create paths of ice over the audience&rsquo;s heads. Momo then shot out a bunch of confetti, and Ochako dove into the crowd and floated a bunch of people to\nhave a dance party in mid-air. Iida doing the robot was the highlight of the chapter and indeed the whole manga, but Jirou was a close second, with\nan adorable flashback to when she first told her parents she wanted to be a\nhero instead of a musician, and they were the most supportive EVER, and it was\namazing. Even the surly upperclassmen were won over by class A&rsquo;s general vibe\nof awesomeness, and everyone danced their hearts out, and Eri was THRILLED and her smile was brighter than the sun and\nMirio cried and oh my gosh you guys. I just feel bad for the rest of the\nclasses that have to follow this act now lmao.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Class 1-B puts on the most audacious fanfiction-turned-stage-play since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. All Might informs Deku that he has 47 missed calls and next time would it kill him to PICK UP HIS GODDAMN CELL PHONE jesus christ. Hounddog rips Deku a new one and tells him to be more careful in the future and throws him 20 feet into the air and tells him to go have fun. Eri is so fucking cute that I almost burst into tears just from how cute she is. The surly upperclassmen apologize for their shit attitudes and vow to spread the word of how class 1-A is actually really fucking cool. Kendou, Kenranzaki, and Hadou battle it out for the Miss Con title and Hadou finally wins the title after three years. The kids enjoy the rest of the festival, and Deku gives Eri a homemade candy apple before bidding her farewell. Down at the station, a nice gorilla man sits with with the detailed Gentle and Aiba. Gentle explains that Aiba was never directly involved in any crimes and accepts responsibility for his misdeeds, thus taking his first steps towards rehabilitation.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n\n(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I&rsquo;ve read up through chapter 207 now, so any ETAs will reflect that.)<br /></p>\n</p>",
