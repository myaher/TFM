I\u2019m nt very proud\n\nof it, it gets a bit messy at some\u00a0point but i really\u00a0\u00a0\n\nlike the ending! hope you\n\nguys enjoy!! xx</i></b></p><p>Sun was setting, a folk of birds flew past Y/N\u2019s bedroom\nwindow ruffling her curtains, a crow was crowing at a distance, cars were\nhonking on the street and Y/N could hear the busy chattering on the roads of\nLA, but Y/N laid limp on her bed.</p><p>It was second day, maybe third, after what happened but Y/N\nhadn\u2019t gotten up from her bed. She hadn\u2019t called her friends to bring her ice\ncream so she could watch sappy romantic movies on Netflix while eating them;\nshe hadn\u2019t ordered pizzas so she could eat and watch Avengers or Harry Potter\nfor the hundredth time; she hadn\u2019t taken out her wine from her fridge and\ncursed at the stupid people who went alone in a haunted house and got\nthemselves killed. Y/N hadn\u2019t move. She only moved when she needed to use the\ntoilet or when she got a call from her friend asking why she hadn\u2019t gone to uni\nthat day or when she got a call from her mother in abroad asking how she was.\nShe lied every time - she was sick, she told her friends; she was fine but busy\nwith uni, she told her mother.</p><p>Part of her hated that, part of her felt pathetic, part of\nher was optimist and told her she didn\u2019t need him, part of her told her to get\nup and do some work, that she was just wasting her time and part of her felt\nnumb. </p><p>She felt numb mostly, that is why she didn\u2019t fall into her\ndepression and that is why she wasn\u2019t optimist. Y/N knew pushing Harry away\nwould be hard, very hard but she didn\u2019t thought it\u2019d be that hard.</p><p>Harry had called her a dozen of times, texted her a dozen of\ntimes but she hadn\u2019t picked up or replied to any, in fact she didn\u2019t even\nbother to silence her phone or block him, she just let his sweet voice echo\nthroughout her completely silent house.</p><p>Sun was almost set when \u2018Sweet Creature\u2019 blared through her\nphone for the eighth time that day. Y/N knew instantly who it was. She had set\nthat as his ringtone, so she knew always it was him.</p><p>\u2018So, I know it\u2019s my sweet creature calling me,\u2019 Y/N would\nalways say cheekily whenever he asked why she had that as his ringtone. He even\nsuggested to have &lsquo;Sign Of The Times\u2019 as his ringtone, but she had dismissed it\nstraight away.</p><p>Y/N closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. </p><p>She consumed his voice in as her room wall echoed his\nmelodies and as her heart was filled with his words. It hurt her more, listening\nto him - it made her want to cry but she didn\u2019t\u2026she hadn\u2019t cried once after\nthat night. </p><p>Her heart felt heavy but tears refused to escape from her\neyes, her eyes felt sleepy but that was another thing she couldn\u2019t get.</p><p>After a while her phone stopped ringing making Y/N let out a\nstrike of heavy breathe. Her body ached for laying in the bed for so long, but\nshe didn\u2019t have the energy to move, she didn\u2019t have the energy to sleep.</p><p>Y/N once thought of taking sleeping pills, but she always\nhated taking those pills - she felt like it wasn\u2019t her\u2026.but that time she\ndidn\u2019t know who she was.</p><p>As much as she could remember, she wasn\u2019t that person she\nwas currently. She wasn\u2019t a person who\u2019d cry for hours on her bed for a boy,\nshe wasn\u2019t a person who\u2019d lay on the bed for days just because a boy didn\u2019t\nlove her and she wasn\u2019t a person who felt lost because of some boy.</p><p>Y/N moved on her side slowly, bringing her blanket up to her\nchest as she curled into a small ball. She wanted to sleep, even for an hour;\neven for ten minutes\u2026.that was the only way she could get away from her\naching heart.</p><p>Y/N curled further into a ball and tried to breathe\nrhythmically. That was a trick he had taught her for helping her sleep and\nsurprisingly it worked very well for her. So, like any other time Y/N started\nto doze off slowly.</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t long after she heard her front door\nclicking open making Y/N jolt up from her half sleepy and half awake state. Y/N\ngot on her back again as she tried to listen to the footsteps. It could either\nbe her best friend Meg trying to see what was up with her best friend or it\ncould be him.</p><p>The person didn\u2019t even have to enter her room, she already\nknew who it was when the footsteps reached the staircase, it was him - only his\nboots sounded like that. Y/N closed her eyes again and pretended to sleep, she\nwasn\u2019t ready to face him, not yet.</p><p>Y/N heard her bedroom door open, but Y/N didn\u2019t make any\nmovement to acknowledge the person\u2019s presence. She continued to pretend that\nshe was asleep, even though she felt like it was the most immature thing to do.\nBut, she couldn\u2019t help herself, she just wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>Y/N heard the footstep nearing to her side of the bed and\nthen she felt the bed sunk down just a little above her head. Y/N knew what was\ncoming next. Harry slowly lifted her head and rested it on his thigh and softly\nplayed with her hair.</p><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019re not asleep,\u201d Harry\u2019s raspy but yet\nsoft voice rang through Y/N\u2019s ears as she felt him kissing on her head just a\ncentimeter away from her ear.</p><p>This steered something in Y/N, she wanted to jolt up,\nslapping his hand away from her and yell him to get out but she didn\u2019t. She\njust laid there under his touch. His each finger tips, his hands, his presence\njust felt like a comfort, the comfort she didn\u2019t get for past few days; the\ncomfort she needed so bad.</p><p>Y/N bought her left hand up and clutched on his thigh\nopening her eyes. No one said anything for few moments, it was silent -\ncompletely silent; Y/N felt that they could hear a pin falling on the floor.\nHowever, the silence wasn\u2019t uncomfortable; to Y/N it was as comforting as his\npresence.</p><p>\u201cThe other night, when you said you loved me,\u201d\nHarry finally spoke as he continued playing with her hair. \u201cI wanted to\nsay I love you too.\u201d</p><p>This made Y/N look up at him. She slowly sat up not breaking\nher gaze on him as she asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you Y/N,\u201d Harry said sincerely.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t have the gut to accept it, it was me\nafter all who suggested the 'no strings attached\u2019 thing,\u201d Harry said when\nY/N didn\u2019t reply. </p><p>Yes, it was Harry who said that there will be no emotions,\nno feelings, no nothings. Y/N had later titled it by 'no strings attached\u2019 but\nhere they were both madly in love with each other.</p><p>\u201cThen why today, not that night?\u201d Y/N asked\ntimidly.</p><p>\u201cI was scared, I - I didn\u2019t know what I felt. I knew\nwhat I felt but I didn\u2019t want to accept it,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAnd, being\naway from you for these mere three days I realized I couldn\u2019t a pass single day\nknowing I won\u2019t meet you that day.\u201d</p><p>Y/N had a lump in her throat. She didn\u2019t know what to feel -\nshe was happy, she was very happy knowing her love, loved her too, but she was\nconfused, so confused.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you scared?\u201d Y/N asked her voice small.</p><p>Harry looked down at his lap, \u201cI don\u2019t know Y/N, you\nwere so young- \u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung, young?\u201d Y/N bitterly laughed cutting him\noff. \u201cYou had sex with me literally every day, that time it didn\u2019t bother\nyou but it bothered while accepting you loved me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s stupid, I just didn\u2019t,\u201d Harry sighed\nlooking down. \u201cI guess, I didn\u2019t want to have feelings for you, it just\nfelt\u2026 wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right, it didn\u2019t feel wrong fucking me, and\nhaving feelings for me was suddenly wrong,\u201d Y/N muttered looking away from\nhim, trying to hide her watery eyes.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it felt wrong when we did it, but love that was\nthe only way I could be that close to you and that was the only relation\nthrough which I could know you,\u201d Harry said taking Y/N\u2019s hand. Y/N looked\nat their intertwined hand before looking up at. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes were watery and mouth was in a pout. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Y/N said almost like a child, whose parent forgot to\nbuy her favorite candy on their way home.</p><p>\u201cI kno-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stupid,\u201d Y/N said. \u201cSo, so\nstupid,\u201d without saying anything else,\u00a0Y/N slowly went up and settled\nherself on Harry\u2019s lap, wrapping her legs and arms around him as she let her\ntears roll down her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N\u2019s chest felt lighter as she continued to sniffle on\nHarry\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cBubba, why are you crying?\u201d Harry whispered as he\nplanted a kiss just under Y/N\u2019s ear while running his hand up and down Y/N\u2019s\nback, reassuring her.\u00a0Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile brightly, he was so\nhappy\u00a0having Y/N in his arms again. He missed her so much. He didn\u2019t even\nknow how he spent\u00a0those three days knowing she was broken, knowing he left\nher broken. He really was stupid.</p><p>\u201cBecause, you\u2019re stupid,\u201d Y/N said into his neck.</p><p>This made Harry chuckle as he looked down at Y/N. \u201cYou\u2019re crying\nbecause I\u2019m stupid?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked up at him as a laugh escaped through her lips. She didn\u2019t have\nher pout anymore; it had broke into a bright smile while she tried to wipe her\ntear streaked face.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Harry said grabbing Y/N\u2019s small hand and wiping the tears\nhimself.</p><p>\u201cNo need to cry anymore, my love,\u201d with that he kissed her.</p><p>That kiss was nothing like the kisses they had ever shared. The kiss was\npassionate, it was fiery and hot; it was demanding; it was Like a drug they\nboth were addicted to - the more they kissed, the more they wanted.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Y/N replied.</p>",

She hadn\u2019t called her friends to bring her ice\ncream so she could watch sappy romantic movies on Netflix while eating them;\nshe hadn\u2019t ordered pizzas so she could eat and watch Avengers or Harry Potter\nfor the hundredth time; she hadn\u2019t taken out her wine from her fridge and\ncursed at the stupid people who went alone in a haunted house and got\nthemselves killed. Y/N hadn\u2019t move. She only moved when she needed to use the\ntoilet or when she got a call from her friend asking why she hadn\u2019t gone to uni\nthat day or when she got a call from her mother in abroad asking how she was.\nShe lied every time - she was sick, she told her friends; she was fine but busy\nwith uni, she told her mother.</p><p>Part of her hated that, part of her felt pathetic, part of\nher was optimist and told her she didn\u2019t need him, part of her told her to get\nup and do some work, that she was just wasting her time and part of her felt\nnumb. </p><p>She felt numb mostly, that is why she didn\u2019t fall into her\ndepression and that is why she wasn\u2019t optimist. Y/N knew pushing Harry away\nwould be hard, very hard but she didn\u2019t thought it\u2019d be that hard.</p><p>Harry had called her a dozen of times, texted her a dozen of\ntimes but she hadn\u2019t picked up or replied to any, in fact she didn\u2019t even\nbother to silence her phone or block him, she just let his sweet voice echo\nthroughout her completely silent house.</p><p>Sun was almost set when \u2018Sweet Creature\u2019 blared through her\nphone for the eighth time that day. Y/N knew instantly who it was. She had set\nthat as his ringtone, so she knew always it was him.</p><p>\u2018So, I know it\u2019s my sweet creature calling me,\u2019 Y/N would\nalways say cheekily whenever he asked why she had that as his ringtone. He even\nsuggested to have \u2018Sign Of The Times\u2019 as his ringtone, but she had dismissed it\nstraight away.</p><p>Y/N closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. </p><p>She consumed his voice in as her room wall echoed his\nmelodies and as her heart was filled with his words. It hurt her more, listening\nto him - it made her want to cry but she didn\u2019t\u2026she hadn\u2019t cried once after\nthat night. </p><p>Her heart felt heavy but tears refused to escape from her\neyes, her eyes felt sleepy but that was another thing she couldn\u2019t get.</p><p>After a while her phone stopped ringing making Y/N let out a\nstrike of heavy breathe. Her body ached for laying in the bed for so long, but\nshe didn\u2019t have the energy to move, she didn\u2019t have the energy to sleep.</p><p>Y/N once thought of taking sleeping pills, but she always\nhated taking those pills - she felt like it wasn\u2019t her\u2026.but that time she\ndidn\u2019t know who she was.</p><p>As much as she could remember, she wasn\u2019t that person she\nwas currently. She wasn\u2019t a person who\u2019d cry for hours on her bed for a boy,\nshe wasn\u2019t a person who\u2019d lay on the bed for days just because a boy didn\u2019t\nlove her and she wasn\u2019t a person who felt lost because of some boy.</p><p>Y/N moved on her side slowly, bringing her blanket up to her\nchest as she curled into a small ball. She wanted to sleep, even for an hour;\neven for ten minutes\u2026.that was the only way she could get away from her\naching heart.</p><p>Y/N curled further into a ball and tried to breathe\nrhythmically. That was a trick he had taught her for helping her sleep and\nsurprisingly it worked very well for her. So, like any other time Y/N started\nto doze off slowly.</p><p>However, it wasn\u2019t long after she heard her front door\nclicking open making Y/N jolt up from her half sleepy and half awake state. Y/N\ngot on her back again as she tried to listen to the footsteps. It could either\nbe her best friend Meg trying to see what was up with her best friend or it\ncould be him.</p><p>The person didn\u2019t even have to enter her room, she already\nknew who it was when the footsteps reached the staircase, it was him - only his\nboots sounded like that. Y/N closed her eyes again and pretended to sleep, she\nwasn\u2019t ready to face him, not yet.</p><p>Y/N heard her bedroom door open, but Y/N didn\u2019t make any\nmovement to acknowledge the person\u2019s presence. She continued to pretend that\nshe was asleep, even though she felt like it was the most immature thing to do.\nBut, she couldn\u2019t help herself, she just wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>Y/N heard the footstep nearing to her side of the bed and\nthen she felt the bed sunk down just a little above her head. Y/N knew what was\ncoming next. Harry slowly lifted her head and rested it on his thigh and softly\nplayed with her hair.</p><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019re not asleep,\u201d Harry\u2019s raspy but yet\nsoft voice rang through Y/N\u2019s ears as she felt him kissing on her head just a\ncentimeter away from her ear.</p><p>This steered something in Y/N, she wanted to jolt up,\nslapping his hand away from her and yell him to get out but she didn\u2019t. She\njust laid there under his touch. His each finger tips, his hands, his presence\njust felt like a comfort, the comfort she didn\u2019t get for past few days; the\ncomfort she needed so bad.</p><p>Y/N bought her left hand up and clutched on his thigh\nopening her eyes. No one said anything for few moments, it was silent -\ncompletely silent; Y/N felt that they could hear a pin falling on the floor.\nHowever, the silence wasn\u2019t uncomfortable; to Y/N it was as comforting as his\npresence.</p><p>\u201cThe other night, when you said you loved me,\u201d\nHarry finally spoke as he continued playing with her hair. \u201cI wanted to\nsay I love you too.\u201d</p><p>This made Y/N look up at him. She slowly sat up not breaking\nher gaze on him as she asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you Y/N,\u201d Harry said sincerely.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t have the gut to accept it, it was me\nafter all who suggested the 'no strings attached\u2019 thing,\u201d Harry said when\nY/N didn\u2019t reply. </p><p>Yes, it was Harry who said that there will be no emotions,\nno feelings, no nothings. Y/N had later titled it by 'no strings attached\u2019 but\nhere they were both madly in love with each other.</p><p>\u201cThen why today, not that night?\u201d Y/N asked\ntimidly.</p><p>\u201cI was scared, I - I didn\u2019t know what I felt. I knew\nwhat I felt but I didn\u2019t want to accept it,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAnd, being\naway from you for these mere three days I realized I couldn\u2019t a pass single day\nknowing I won\u2019t meet you that day.\u201d</p><p>Y/N had a lump in her throat. She didn\u2019t know what to feel -\nshe was happy, she was very happy knowing her love, loved her too, but she was\nconfused, so confused.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you scared?\u201d Y/N asked her voice small.</p><p>Harry looked down at his lap, \u201cI don\u2019t know Y/N, you\nwere so young- \u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung, young?\u201d Y/N bitterly laughed cutting him\noff. \u201cYou had sex with me literally every day, that time it didn\u2019t bother\nyou but it bothered while accepting you loved me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s stupid, I just didn\u2019t,\u201d Harry sighed\nlooking down. \u201cI guess, I didn\u2019t want to have feelings for you, it just\nfelt\u2026 wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right, it didn\u2019t feel wrong fucking me, and\nhaving feelings for me was suddenly wrong,\u201d Y/N muttered looking away from\nhim, trying to hide her watery eyes.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it felt wrong when we did it, but love that was\nthe only way I could be that close to you and that was the only relation\nthrough which I could know you,\u201d Harry said taking Y/N\u2019s hand. Y/N looked\nat their intertwined hand before looking up at. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes were watery and mouth was in a pout. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Y/N said almost like a child, whose parent forgot to\nbuy her favorite candy on their way home.</p><p>\u201cI kno-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stupid,\u201d Y/N said. \u201cSo, so\nstupid,\u201d without saying anything else,\u00a0Y/N slowly went up and settled\nherself on Harry\u2019s lap, wrapping her legs and arms around him as she let her\ntears roll down her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N\u2019s chest felt lighter as she continued to sniffle on\nHarry\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cBubba, why are you crying?\u201d Harry whispered as he\nplanted a kiss just under Y/N\u2019s ear while running his hand up and down Y/N\u2019s\nback, reassuring her.\u00a0Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile brightly, he was so\nhappy\u00a0having Y/N in his arms again. He missed her so much. He didn\u2019t even\nknow how he spent\u00a0those three days knowing she was broken, knowing he left\nher broken. He really was stupid.</p><p>\u201cBecause, you\u2019re stupid,\u201d Y/N said into his neck.</p><p>This made Harry chuckle as he looked down at Y/N. \u201cYou\u2019re crying\nbecause I\u2019m stupid?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked up at him as a laugh escaped through her lips. She didn\u2019t have\nher pout anymore; it had broke into a bright smile while she tried to wipe her\ntear streaked face.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Harry said grabbing Y/N\u2019s small hand and wiping the tears\nhimself.</p><p>\u201cNo need to cry anymore, my love,\u201d with that he kissed her.</p><p>That kiss was nothing like the kisses they had ever shared. The kiss was\npassionate, it was fiery and hot; it was demanding; it was Like a drug they\nboth were addicted to - the more they kissed, the more they wanted.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Y/N replied.</p>",

I&rsquo;m nt very proud\n\nof it, it gets a bit messy at some&nbsp;point but i really&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nlike the ending! hope you\n\nguys enjoy!! xx</i></b></p><p>Sun was setting, a folk of birds flew past Y/N&rsquo;s bedroom\nwindow ruffling her curtains, a crow was crowing at a distance, cars were\nhonking on the street and Y/N could hear the busy chattering on the roads of\nLA, but Y/N laid limp on her bed.</p><p>It was second day, maybe third, after what happened but Y/N\nhadn&rsquo;t gotten up from her bed. She hadn&rsquo;t called her friends to bring her ice\ncream so she could watch sappy romantic movies on Netflix while eating them;\nshe hadn&rsquo;t ordered pizzas so she could eat and watch Avengers or Harry Potter\nfor the hundredth time; she hadn&rsquo;t taken out her wine from her fridge and\ncursed at the stupid people who went alone in a haunted house and got\nthemselves killed. Y/N hadn&rsquo;t move. She only moved when she needed to use the\ntoilet or when she got a call from her friend asking why she hadn&rsquo;t gone to uni\nthat day or when she got a call from her mother in abroad asking how she was.\nShe lied every time - she was sick, she told her friends; she was fine but busy\nwith uni, she told her mother.</p><p>Part of her hated that, part of her felt pathetic, part of\nher was optimist and told her she didn&rsquo;t need him, part of her told her to get\nup and do some work, that she was just wasting her time and part of her felt\nnumb. </p><p>She felt numb mostly, that is why she didn&rsquo;t fall into her\ndepression and that is why she wasn&rsquo;t optimist. Y/N knew pushing Harry away\nwould be hard, very hard but she didn&rsquo;t thought it&rsquo;d be that hard.</p><p>Harry had called her a dozen of times, texted her a dozen of\ntimes but she hadn&rsquo;t picked up or replied to any, in fact she didn&rsquo;t even\nbother to silence her phone or block him, she just let his sweet voice echo\nthroughout her completely silent house.</p><p>Sun was almost set when &lsquo;Sweet Creature&rsquo; blared through her\nphone for the eighth time that day. Y/N knew instantly who it was. She had set\nthat as his ringtone, so she knew always it was him.</p><p>&lsquo;So, I know it&rsquo;s my sweet creature calling me,&rsquo; Y/N would\nalways say cheekily whenever he asked why she had that as his ringtone. He even\nsuggested to have &lsquo;Sign Of The Times&rsquo; as his ringtone, but she had dismissed it\nstraight away.</p><p>Y/N closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. </p><p>She consumed his voice in as her room wall echoed his\nmelodies and as her heart was filled with his words. It hurt her more, listening\nto him - it made her want to cry but she didn&rsquo;t&hellip;she hadn&rsquo;t cried once after\nthat night. </p><p>Her heart felt heavy but tears refused to escape from her\neyes, her eyes felt sleepy but that was another thing she couldn&rsquo;t get.</p><p>After a while her phone stopped ringing making Y/N let out a\nstrike of heavy breathe. Her body ached for laying in the bed for so long, but\nshe didn&rsquo;t have the energy to move, she didn&rsquo;t have the energy to sleep.</p><p>Y/N once thought of taking sleeping pills, but she always\nhated taking those pills - she felt like it wasn&rsquo;t her&hellip;.but that time she\ndidn&rsquo;t know who she was.</p><p>As much as she could remember, she wasn&rsquo;t that person she\nwas currently. She wasn&rsquo;t a person who&rsquo;d cry for hours on her bed for a boy,\nshe wasn&rsquo;t a person who&rsquo;d lay on the bed for days just because a boy didn&rsquo;t\nlove her and she wasn&rsquo;t a person who felt lost because of some boy.</p><p>Y/N moved on her side slowly, bringing her blanket up to her\nchest as she curled into a small ball. She wanted to sleep, even for an hour;\neven for ten minutes&hellip;.that was the only way she could get away from her\naching heart.</p><p>Y/N curled further into a ball and tried to breathe\nrhythmically. That was a trick he had taught her for helping her sleep and\nsurprisingly it worked very well for her. So, like any other time Y/N started\nto doze off slowly.</p><p>However, it wasn&rsquo;t long after she heard her front door\nclicking open making Y/N jolt up from her half sleepy and half awake state. Y/N\ngot on her back again as she tried to listen to the footsteps. It could either\nbe her best friend Meg trying to see what was up with her best friend or it\ncould be him.</p><p>The person didn&rsquo;t even have to enter her room, she already\nknew who it was when the footsteps reached the staircase, it was him - only his\nboots sounded like that. Y/N closed her eyes again and pretended to sleep, she\nwasn&rsquo;t ready to face him, not yet.</p><p>Y/N heard her bedroom door open, but Y/N didn&rsquo;t make any\nmovement to acknowledge the person&rsquo;s presence. She continued to pretend that\nshe was asleep, even though she felt like it was the most immature thing to do.\nBut, she couldn&rsquo;t help herself, she just wasn&rsquo;t ready.</p><p>Y/N heard the footstep nearing to her side of the bed and\nthen she felt the bed sunk down just a little above her head. Y/N knew what was\ncoming next. Harry slowly lifted her head and rested it on his thigh and softly\nplayed with her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, you&rsquo;re not asleep,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s raspy but yet\nsoft voice rang through Y/N&rsquo;s ears as she felt him kissing on her head just a\ncentimeter away from her ear.</p><p>This steered something in Y/N, she wanted to jolt up,\nslapping his hand away from her and yell him to get out but she didn&rsquo;t. She\njust laid there under his touch. His each finger tips, his hands, his presence\njust felt like a comfort, the comfort she didn&rsquo;t get for past few days; the\ncomfort she needed so bad.</p><p>Y/N bought her left hand up and clutched on his thigh\nopening her eyes. No one said anything for few moments, it was silent -\ncompletely silent; Y/N felt that they could hear a pin falling on the floor.\nHowever, the silence wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortable; to Y/N it was as comforting as his\npresence.</p><p>&ldquo;The other night, when you said you loved me,&rdquo;\nHarry finally spoke as he continued playing with her hair. &ldquo;I wanted to\nsay I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>This made Y/N look up at him. She slowly sat up not breaking\nher gaze on him as she asked, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you Y/N,&rdquo; Harry said sincerely.</p><p>&ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t have the gut to accept it, it was me\nafter all who suggested the 'no strings attached&rsquo; thing,&rdquo; Harry said when\nY/N didn&rsquo;t reply. </p><p>Yes, it was Harry who said that there will be no emotions,\nno feelings, no nothings. Y/N had later titled it by 'no strings attached&rsquo; but\nhere they were both madly in love with each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why today, not that night?&rdquo; Y/N asked\ntimidly.</p><p>&ldquo;I was scared, I - I didn&rsquo;t know what I felt. I knew\nwhat I felt but I didn&rsquo;t want to accept it,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;And, being\naway from you for these mere three days I realized I couldn&rsquo;t a pass single day\nknowing I won&rsquo;t meet you that day.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N had a lump in her throat. She didn&rsquo;t know what to feel -\nshe was happy, she was very happy knowing her love, loved her too, but she was\nconfused, so confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Why were you scared?&rdquo; Y/N asked her voice small.</p><p>Harry looked down at his lap, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Y/N, you\nwere so young- &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Young, young?&rdquo; Y/N bitterly laughed cutting him\noff. &ldquo;You had sex with me literally every day, that time it didn&rsquo;t bother\nyou but it bothered while accepting you loved me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, it&rsquo;s stupid, I just didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Harry sighed\nlooking down. &ldquo;I guess, I didn&rsquo;t want to have feelings for you, it just\nfelt&hellip; wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, right, it didn&rsquo;t feel wrong fucking me, and\nhaving feelings for me was suddenly wrong,&rdquo; Y/N muttered looking away from\nhim, trying to hide her watery eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it felt wrong when we did it, but love that was\nthe only way I could be that close to you and that was the only relation\nthrough which I could know you,&rdquo; Harry said taking Y/N&rsquo;s hand. Y/N looked\nat their intertwined hand before looking up at. </p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s eyes were watery and mouth was in a pout. &ldquo;It\ndoesn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; Y/N said almost like a child, whose parent forgot to\nbuy her favorite candy on their way home.</p><p>&ldquo;I kno-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so stupid,&rdquo; Y/N said. &ldquo;So, so\nstupid,&rdquo; without saying anything else,&nbsp;Y/N slowly went up and settled\nherself on Harry&rsquo;s lap, wrapping her legs and arms around him as she let her\ntears roll down her eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s chest felt lighter as she continued to sniffle on\nHarry&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Bubba, why are you crying?&rdquo; Harry whispered as he\nplanted a kiss just under Y/N&rsquo;s ear while running his hand up and down Y/N&rsquo;s\nback, reassuring her.&nbsp;Harry couldn&rsquo;t help but smile brightly, he was so\nhappy&nbsp;having Y/N in his arms again.

He\u2019s never taken a girl out for a romantic dinner or bought her flowers or written love notes. That\u2019s not who he is, well, <i>was</i>, in past tense. Because with Y/N now in the picture, he kind of wants to be that person for her. He\u2019s more than willing to change, which, he believes, shouldn\u2019t be too hard since he hasn\u2019t been the same since they first met. However, he cannot help but feel like there\u2019s still so much more to work on. After all, he doesn\u2019t want Y/N to leave him, that\u2019s the thing he fears the most.</p><p>\u201cI want to take you out on a date,\u201d he says to her the next morning, one day after their first kiss. \u201cI stayed up last night to plan the whole thing, you just need to say yes.\u201d</p><p>Y/N, still in her PJ, stares at Harry from her bedroom door with her eyes widened. </p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to.\u201d She crosses her arms in front of her chest. \u201cWe hang out all the time, and we\u2019re also living together! I mean, you fell asleep in my bed last night during The Notebook! We already look like a married couple to me, we don\u2019t need a fancy date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Yes, we do.\u201d Harry scoffs. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be boyfriend and girlfriend, you\u2019re getting a proper first date!\u201d</p><p>They\u2019ve never discussed this topic before, but Y/N honestly finds him referring to them as boyfriend and girlfriend kind of sexy. She immediately walks up to Harry and throws both arms around his neck, as a result, making him smile so wide.</p><p>\u201cI like this Harry. Let\u2019s keep him.\u201d Y/N\u2019s comment makes her flatmate chuckle. He cocks his head to the side and rests his hands gently on her lower back. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere. I guarantee,\u201d Harry tells Y/N with certainty.</p><p>&hellip;</p><!-- more --><p>Y/N spends almost two hours digging through her closet, trying on clothes for her date with Harry tonight. She eventually comes to a decision to wear this basic flowered black dress she hasn\u2019t worn again since her sixteenth birthday, because her boyfriend back then said it made her look old. But when Harry finally sees Y/N in that dress, he\u00a0tells her without a second thought that she looks \u2018<i>very beautiful\u2019</i>. He could lie and she wouldn\u2019t care, she\u2019s never been more sure of her feelings for anyone else.</p><p>On their way leaving their flat, Harry and Y/N run into their next door neighbor Ben who just came back home from work. In contrast to the cheerfulness on the young couple\u2019s faces, the man appears a bit irritated and upset, though he immediately hides that look behind a smile when he sees them.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, lovelies. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh&hellip;Dinner,\u201d is Harry\u2019s answer as he exchanges looks with Y/N, such behavior can never pass the eyes of their experienced neighbor.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, are you two going on <i>a date</i>?\u201d he gasps, only receiving two smiles as a confirmation but that\u2019s all he needs.</p><p>\u201c<i>Finally</i>! I was rooting for you guys!\u201d Ben squeals, clapping his hands excitedly.\u00a0\u201cWait until the gossip lady downstairs hear about this! She thinks\u00a0getting money from me is easy? I\u2019ll show her!\u201d</p><p>Harry stares at the older guy with bulging eyes.\u00a0\u201cBen, you made a bet on us?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooooo, I actually made a bet on <i>you</i>. That woman said you would chicken out but I believed in you mate.\u201d\u00a0Ben gives Harry a pat on the back, making\u00a0Y/N crack up whilst Harry just stands there squinting his eyes, unsure whether he should get upset or say thank you.</p><p>\u201cSo which one of you made the first move? How did this happen exactly?\u201d Ben asks, quickly switching his finger back and forth from Harry to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>The pair just look at each other, shrug and speak at the same time,\u00a0\u201clong story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say! Couples who speak together stay together!\u201d Ben says as he turns the key to open his front door.\u00a0\u201cSorry, that was rude of me to take so much of your time. You kids have fun on your date, okay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a lovely night, Ben!\u201d Y/N tells him with a smile, and when she turns away, Ben secretly winks at Harry and gives the young man, who\u2019s grinning from ear to ear,\u00a0an encouraging thumb up.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>It only takes fifteen minutes driving to their dinner location, but Harry swears those fifteen minutes seem like a whole fucking lifetime. He remembers his first time going to school, his first time going to the hospital after breaking his arm, his first kiss, and first time having sex, none of those things made Harry as nervous as he is now. Just the simple thought of Y/N not liking the food or service at the restaurant makes his palms heavily sweat. Then he starts to wonder to himself how some of his friends can make going on dates look so easy.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s worry doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. As soon as she sees him puckering his forehead while tapping his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel, she immediately reaches for his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress too much.\u00a0You could just take me to McDonald\u2019s and I\u2019d still be very very happy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry blurts out. \u201c<i>I love you</i>.\u201d</p><p>It was supposed to be a thought in his head only, but the words slipped right out before Harry could even stop himself. As a result, his\u00a0face\u00a0turns bright red. Little does he know, Y/N swoons over those words just like the first time he said them to her. She\u00a0leans over from the passenger seat to kiss him on the cheek, then lets him know that she loves him too.</p><p>The traffic is clear tonight so Harry and Y/N arrive at the restaurant a little sooner than scheduled.\u00a0When they walk in, the place is already packed which is\u00a0understandable for it\u2019s Saturday night. Harry\u2019s told Y/N that this is the best restaurant nearby, he knows it because he came here once with his sister when she was still in town and he\u2019s wanted to take Y/N here ever since.</p><p>\u201cTable for two. Harry Styles. 7 PM.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSir, I apologize for the inconvenience but your table may still not be ready yet. You would have to\u00a0wait another five minutes, would it be alright?\u201d says the small lady in the uniform. </p><p>Harry presses his lips into a smile and tells her they don\u2019t mind at all, then watches her hurry\u00a0back inside, probably to take care of his reservation. Harry takes a quick glance at Y/N, who\u2019s holding his hand and grinning to herself, that\u2019s all it takes to boost Harry\u2019s\u00a0confidence to the max. Usually he\u2019s not into sappy stuff like this, but now he finds going on a date strangely enjoyable.\u00a0As long as she\u2019s happy, he\u2019s happy.</p><p><i>However</i>, the enjoyment doesn\u2019t last long for Harry, because he quickly recognizes a familiar face in the crowded room. That young waitress is too busy writing down orders to spot Harry at the entrance. The problem is, she\u2019s not just a familiar waitress.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not eat here! I\u2019m taking you somewhere else, okay?\u201d Harry speaks fast and grabs Y/N by the hand to pull her out of the waiting line.\u00a0</p><p>The lady from earlier calls after Harry to say his table\u2019s ready, still he ignores her, and keeps on walking away. Poor Y/N doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, too confused to even protest and just lets her date lead them back to the street without any clear explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She asks once they\u2019re already outside.\u00a0</p><p>Harry heaves out a sigh as he reads her facial expression, thinking they haven\u2019t got to dinner yet and he\u2019s already made her mad. There\u2019s no point making things up\u00a0now, so he straight off tells\u00a0her he knows a waitress in there and is not comfortable of running into her.\u00a0</p><p>He wants to curse himself out loud for the look on Y/N\u2019s face when she comes to realization. He wants to change, but he cannot change his past and he feels threatened by the possibility of it one day being the reason Y/N walks away from him and never returns. He hangs his head and apologizes for what happened, even though it wasn\u2019t his plan to run into one of his one-night-stands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay really.\u201d Y/N takes a step closer to Harry then presses her palm to his cheek.\u00a0\u201cThanks for being honest with me. Let\u2019s just\u00a0go back inside, I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p><i>It\u2019s confirmed,</i> he thinks. <i>She\u2019s an angel.</i></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to have her serve us dinner. It\u2019d be really weird and uncomfortable. Tonight should only be me and you, no other distractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do you have a back up plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Harry nods with confidence. A wise man always has a back up plan, and he believes he\u2019s a <i>very</i> wise man.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Harry\u2019s back up plan is his second favorite restaurant in this area, he also went here once with his sister, to whom he owes a thank you after tonight.\u00a0This restaurant is smaller and cheaper than the first one, but it\u2019s\u00a0outdoors, which he thinks Y/N may like since they\u2019ll be eating in a garden, surrounded by fairy lights, under the stars. If this isn\u2019t romantic, Harry doesn\u2019t know what is.</p><p>\u201cThis place is beautiful,\u201d Y/N exclaims as she grabs a menu on the table. Harry does the same with a huge smirk on his face, pretty proud of himself for successfully planning out this perfect dinner. It almost seems like nothing else can go wrong.</p><p><i>But&hellip;</i></p><p>Yes, there\u2019s been a lot of \u2018<i>buts</i>\u2019 tonight. The biggest problem Harry doesn\u2019t seem the notice yet, is the fact that they\u2019re sitting <i>outdoors</i> with <i>no roof</i> above their heads.</p><p>Harry\u2019s scanning his eyes through the menu when the first rain drop falls down on his shoulder, he doesn\u2019t feel it. Then comes a few others on his arms and face causing him to look up at the sky. Large pillows of dark clouds are forming, a very bad sign indeed. Five seconds are all it takes for the rain to come pouring down like a water fall. Harry grabs Y/N\u2019s hand\u00a0as they run to take shelter under the nearest roof, unfortunately, they\u2019re not as dry as before when they get there.</p><p>Harry brushes his wet strands of hair out of his eyes, trying to catch his breath as he turns to Y/N, who doesn\u2019t look any better, all soaked from her head to toes.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m wet, let\u2019s just go home,\u201d Y/N says and Harry stares at her with his eyes and his mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cY/N Y/L/N, we\u2019re in public!\u201d he gasps, instantly receives a playful swat on the chest.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br/></p><p>The heavy downpour obscures the view from Y/N\u2019s bedroom window as the wind and raindrops beat on the glass with violent force. Harry\u2019s a bit glad that they got home just before the heavy shower made it impossible to drive, still and all, he\u2019s also\u00a0disappointed for their date was canceled halfway. It was all perfectly planned out in his head, if it hadn\u2019t been for the series of unfortunate events, tonight could\u2019ve been amazing.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s kneeling on her bed in front of Harry, drying his hair with a towel after she\u2019s finished drying her own.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like rain, always sleep better when it\u2019s raining outside,\u201d she softly says.</p><p>Harry stays still with his legs crossed and hands on his lap, like a little puppy as Y/N takes care of him, and she knows he loves being taken care of. At moments like this, he\u2019s just glad they\u2019re living together.</p><p>Y/N puts the towel aside then grabs Harry\u2019s\u00a0face to peck him on the lips, telling him he\u2019s good to go, but he\u2019s certainly not going anywhere now that he has her under his fingertips.\u00a0As Y/N intends to rise from the bed,\u00a0Harry slides his hands up to her hips, making the young woman flinch and blush a little bit when he slowly guides her to sit on his lap, facing him, legs wrapped around his torso.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing this tank top, huh?\u201d he asks with a husky voice when his eyes make a trip down from her lips to her chest. Y/N swallows hard, shifting a little bit in her flatmate\u2019s lap while his eyes are burning holes on her flushed skin.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s comfy?\u201d she almost whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too revealing. It does things to me.\u201d Harry literally growls as he starts nosing at her jaw, she smells like lavender, and he cannot get enough. Y/N\u2019s eyes fall shut. Her fingers soon find their way to his hair then she feels herself melting into their eager kiss.</p><p>\u201cHarry, we-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers against her lips, his eyes are close, too lost in her scent and taste but he\u2019s\u00a0aware of his own intentions.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna do anything you don\u2019t want to. I just want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s thoroughly surprised by his own words. Of course he\u2019s always got good self-control in situations like this, but whenever he was making out with a girl in bed, one way or another, they ended up fucking. This is something different on a whole new level.\u00a0He\u2019s not gonna lie, he wants Y/N without a doubt. Sometimes when he\u2019s alone, he\u00a0even lets his imagination get a bit too wild with the thoughts of them having sex. But Y/N is\u00a0not one of his hookups, she\u2019s special, and he cannot risk losing something so special by rushing this.\u00a0</p><p>When Harry lays Y/N down on her back, she\u2019s already a mess beneath him, half-heartedly wanting him to take her all at once, but for some unknown reasons, she\u2019s afraid. She\u2019s afraid that this is only special to him because they\u2019re not having sex. As soon as they have sex, it\u2019s very unlikely that everything stays the same. Having gone through all those shitty past relationships, Y/N didn\u2019t want to fly too high to come tumbling down at the end, but now there\u2019s no turning back, so she can only hope he won\u2019t leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cHarry, stop!\u201d Y/N nearly shouts as she sits right up, forcing Harry to do the same. He looks rather shocked than confused by his girlfriend\u2019s reaction when just a few seconds ago she seemed like she really enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cD-did I do something wrong? Did I hurt you?\u201d Harry asks, a painful look displays upon his face.\u00a0Y/N, now is already standing by the bed, shakes her head no as a response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me.\u00a0I&hellip;Well&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Her sentence is left unfinished, suddenly interrupted by the loud shouting in the hallway. The gay couple next door are arguing again, but this time it seems pretty serious because they start using really harsh words to call each other. Y/N immediately rushes outside to see if they\u2019re alright, and Harry has no choice but to follow her.</p><p>When they open the door, they only see Ben, his fianc\u00e9 Mark has probably left. Ben stands with his head against the door to his flat and he seems absolutely devastated, so Y/N hurriedly walks up to him and asks if he\u2019s okay.</p><p>\u201cHe cheated on me, Y/N,\u201d the poor guy says between sobs. Y/N and Harry exchange looks with each other but no one speaks a word since presumably he still has a lot to say.</p><p>\u201cI saw the texts on his phone to one of his colleagues. I confronted him about it and we argued, then he walked away&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N swallows hard as Ben turns around to give her a hug. She stands like a statue with her hands on his back, letting her heartbroken friend cry on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe said he loved me and that he would change&hellip;I should never have believed him.\u201d<br/></p><p>The words strike down hard on both Y/N and Harry like a violent hit on the head, each for a different reason. So when they\u2019ve said goodbye and good luck to their distraught neighbor,\u00a0walk back into their flat and close the door, Harry just has to come forward and ask,\u00a0\u201ccan we talk?\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s not in any way fond of those words. Every time she hears it, it\u2019s never news. However, she still calmly turns to face him and gives him a slight nod. Harry takes his seat on the sofa then Y/N follows right after to sit down beside him.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what you thought about tonight,\u201d says Harry as he maintains eye-contact with Y/N.<br/></p><p>\u201cDespite all the things that happened, I loved it.\u201d Y/N smiles at him.\u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I noticed the way you looked when you heard what Ben said, and your reaction earlier in the bedroom. Is there anything you want to tell me, Y/N?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI&hellip;I can\u2019t tell you, you won\u2019t understand.\u201d<br/></p><p>Nothing\u2019s ever hurt her more than the look on his face when she tells him those words. They sit in silence for a couple seconds, then Harry\u2019s the first one to speak up.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s&hellip;not true&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d He frowns, looking so disappointed it breaks her heart.\u00a0\u201cBecause you\u2019re obviously not telling me the truth, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>When he intends to stand up, she immediately grabs onto his arms, eyes begging him not to leave her hanging.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go,\u201d she pleads.</p><p>And he softens all at once.\u00a0\u201cThen tell me what you\u2019re thinking, baby. We promised to be honest to each other no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but promise you won\u2019t be mad?\u201d<br/></p><p>He nods and gives her his word.</p><p>\u201cWell&hellip;The truth is&hellip;I was afraid you will leave me once we\u2019ve had sex&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>His eyes grow wide in reaction to her words. Then without saying a single word, he rises from the sofa then marches away, toward his room. Y/N becomes frantic with worry so she chases after him.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t be mad!\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry instantly stops, then turns around to face his flatmate who\u2019s standing in front of him with fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you. I\u2019m hurt.\u201d<br/></p><p>And Y/N\u2019s speechless. Harry exhales sharply, placing both hands on his hips, and he\u2019s not even looking at her right now.</p><p>\u201cI did everything I could to make you happy, Y/N. I tried to prove to you I\u2019d got better. But how do you expect me to feel when I put so much effort in planning out a date which turned to shit then heard my girlfriend say she thought I only wanted her for sex? It&hellip;It seems like no matter what I do, I\u2019m still the same old me to you, never gonna be\u00a0good enough, aren\u2019t I?\u201d<br/></p><p>Every word he says is like a knife pierced right through her chest and Y/N feels as if she\u2019s already on the verge of crying. She closes the distance between them then wraps her arms around his torso pulling him in. Harry hugs her back despite how downhearted he is by her,\u00a0because no matter what she says or thinks of him, she\u2019s still the one he loves.</p><p>\u201cYou are always enough,\u201d she mumbles into his shirt, though it\u2019s muffled he still hears every word very clearly.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just&hellip;When something\u2019s too good to be true happens to you, you cannot help but feel scared you might lose it&hellip;You falling in love with me is still very surreal to me. My worst fear is one day you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s all an illusion and whatever feelings you\u2019ve had for me aren\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest shit I\u2019ve heard, Y/N.\u00a0If I could just unlove you, I wouldn\u2019t have gone through so much trouble just to prove it to you I\u2019m worth it.\u201d</p><p>She looks at him timidly, but is now more at ease hearing what he has to say.<br/></p><p>\u201cI mean, fuck, have you ever seen me stay up all night to google\u00a0\u2018how to impress a girl on your first date\u2019 before?\u201d Harry rolls his eyes skyward and starts beaming when he hears her\u00a0snort.</p><p>&ldquo;And when I said I only wanted to kiss you, that was <i>really</i> what I meant. I just wanted to kiss you, nothing more. If it was too much, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do it again. <i>But baby</i>&hellip;\u201d Harry heavily breathes.\u00a0\u201c&hellip;I\u2019m a fool for you, and it\u2019s embarrassing how much I enjoy it.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N is in transports of delight as she\u00a0wraps her arms around his neck. Honestly, she\u00a0thinks she\u2019s even a bigger fool than he is in this relationship, because just a look of his green eyes or his beautiful smile or the way her name sounds on his lips can send her straight on cloud nine. And now he\u2019s standing in front of her, saying all <i>that</i>, Y/N is\u00a0just barely breathing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare not kiss me again, understand you fool?!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, ma\u2019am. Shall we carry on where we left off?\u201d Harry smirks and leans down to reattach their lips, but Y/N is quick to stop him with\u00a0a hand on his chest, slightly pushing him away.</p><p>\u201cLater! Now I\u2019m going to make us dinner. Then we\u2019ll finish our wonderful date night by watching Netflix, you\u2019ll\u00a0get to pick the movie this time.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNeed some help in the kitchen?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve done enough, mister! We\u2019re all about gender equality in this house!\u201d Y/N announces loudly as she dances her way into the kitchen, pointing her finger at Harry, who simply\u00a0shakes his head, smiling uncontrollably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p>",

She eventually comes to a decision to wear this basic flowered black dress she hasn\u2019t worn again since her sixteenth birthday, because her boyfriend back then said it made her look old. But when Harry finally sees Y/N in that dress, he\u00a0tells her without a second thought that she looks \u2018<i>very beautiful\u2019</i>. He could lie and she wouldn\u2019t care, she\u2019s never been more sure of her feelings for anyone else.</p><p>On their way leaving their flat, Harry and Y/N run into their next door neighbor Ben who just came back home from work. In contrast to the cheerfulness on the young couple\u2019s faces, the man appears a bit irritated and upset, though he immediately hides that look behind a smile when he sees them.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, lovelies. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026Dinner,\u201d is Harry\u2019s answer as he exchanges looks with Y/N, such behavior can never pass the eyes of their experienced neighbor.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, are you two going on <i>a date</i>?\u201d he gasps, only receiving two smiles as a confirmation but that\u2019s all he needs.</p><p>\u201c<i>Finally</i>! I was rooting for you guys!\u201d Ben squeals, clapping his hands excitedly.\u00a0\u201cWait until the gossip lady downstairs hear about this! She thinks\u00a0getting money from me is easy? I\u2019ll show her!\u201d</p><p>Harry stares at the older guy with bulging eyes.\u00a0\u201cBen, you made a bet on us?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooooo, I actually made a bet on <i>you</i>. That woman said you would chicken out but I believed in you mate.\u201d\u00a0Ben gives Harry a pat on the back, making\u00a0Y/N crack up whilst Harry just stands there squinting his eyes, unsure whether he should get upset or say thank you.</p><p>\u201cSo which one of you made the first move? How did this happen exactly?\u201d Ben asks, quickly switching his finger back and forth from Harry to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>The pair just look at each other, shrug and speak at the same time,\u00a0\u201clong story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say! Couples who speak together stay together!\u201d Ben says as he turns the key to open his front door.\u00a0\u201cSorry, that was rude of me to take so much of your time. You kids have fun on your date, okay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a lovely night, Ben!\u201d Y/N tells him with a smile, and when she turns away, Ben secretly winks at Harry and gives the young man, who\u2019s grinning from ear to ear,\u00a0an encouraging thumb up.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>It only takes fifteen minutes driving to their dinner location, but Harry swears those fifteen minutes seem like a whole fucking lifetime. He remembers his first time going to school, his first time going to the hospital after breaking his arm, his first kiss, and first time having sex, none of those things made Harry as nervous as he is now. Just the simple thought of Y/N not liking the food or service at the restaurant makes his palms heavily sweat. Then he starts to wonder to himself how some of his friends can make going on dates look so easy.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s worry doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. As soon as she sees him puckering his forehead while tapping his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel, she immediately reaches for his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress too much.\u00a0You could just take me to McDonald\u2019s and I\u2019d still be very very happy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry blurts out. \u201c<i>I love you</i>.\u201d</p><p>It was supposed to be a thought in his head only, but the words slipped right out before Harry could even stop himself. As a result, his\u00a0face\u00a0turns bright red. Little does he know, Y/N swoons over those words just like the first time he said them to her. She\u00a0leans over from the passenger seat to kiss him on the cheek, then lets him know that she loves him too.</p><p>The traffic is clear tonight so Harry and Y/N arrive at the restaurant a little sooner than scheduled.\u00a0When they walk in, the place is already packed which is\u00a0understandable for it\u2019s Saturday night. Harry\u2019s told Y/N that this is the best restaurant nearby, he knows it because he came here once with his sister when she was still in town and he\u2019s wanted to take Y/N here ever since.</p><p>\u201cTable for two. Harry Styles. 7 PM.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSir, I apologize for the inconvenience but your table may still not be ready yet. You would have to\u00a0wait another five minutes, would it be alright?\u201d says the small lady in the uniform. </p><p>Harry presses his lips into a smile and tells her they don\u2019t mind at all, then watches her hurry\u00a0back inside, probably to take care of his reservation. Harry takes a quick glance at Y/N, who\u2019s holding his hand and grinning to herself, that\u2019s all it takes to boost Harry\u2019s\u00a0confidence to the max. Usually he\u2019s not into sappy stuff like this, but now he finds going on a date strangely enjoyable.\u00a0As long as she\u2019s happy, he\u2019s happy.</p><p><i>However</i>, the enjoyment doesn\u2019t last long for Harry, because he quickly recognizes a familiar face in the crowded room. That young waitress is too busy writing down orders to spot Harry at the entrance. The problem is, she\u2019s not just a familiar waitress.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not eat here! I\u2019m taking you somewhere else, okay?\u201d Harry speaks fast and grabs Y/N by the hand to pull her out of the waiting line.\u00a0</p><p>The lady from earlier calls after Harry to say his table\u2019s ready, still he ignores her, and keeps on walking away. Poor Y/N doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, too confused to even protest and just lets her date lead them back to the street without any clear explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She asks once they\u2019re already outside.\u00a0</p><p>Harry heaves out a sigh as he reads her facial expression, thinking they haven\u2019t got to dinner yet and he\u2019s already made her mad. There\u2019s no point making things up\u00a0now, so he straight off tells\u00a0her he knows a waitress in there and is not comfortable of running into her.\u00a0</p><p>He wants to curse himself out loud for the look on Y/N\u2019s face when she comes to realization. He wants to change, but he cannot change his past and he feels threatened by the possibility of it one day being the reason Y/N walks away from him and never returns. He hangs his head and apologizes for what happened, even though it wasn\u2019t his plan to run into one of his one-night-stands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay really.\u201d Y/N takes a step closer to Harry then presses her palm to his cheek.\u00a0\u201cThanks for being honest with me. Let\u2019s just\u00a0go back inside, I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p><i>It\u2019s confirmed,</i> he thinks. <i>She\u2019s an angel.</i></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to have her serve us dinner. It\u2019d be really weird and uncomfortable. Tonight should only be me and you, no other distractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do you have a back up plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Harry nods with confidence. A wise man always has a back up plan, and he believes he\u2019s a <i>very</i> wise man.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Harry\u2019s back up plan is his second favorite restaurant in this area, he also went here once with his sister, to whom he owes a thank you after tonight.\u00a0This restaurant is smaller and cheaper than the first one, but it\u2019s\u00a0outdoors, which he thinks Y/N may like since they\u2019ll be eating in a garden, surrounded by fairy lights, under the stars. If this isn\u2019t romantic, Harry doesn\u2019t know what is.</p><p>\u201cThis place is beautiful,\u201d Y/N exclaims as she grabs a menu on the table. Harry does the same with a huge smirk on his face, pretty proud of himself for successfully planning out this perfect dinner. It almost seems like nothing else can go wrong.</p><p><i>But\u2026</i></p><p>Yes, there\u2019s been a lot of \u2018<i>buts</i>\u2019 tonight. The biggest problem Harry doesn\u2019t seem the notice yet, is the fact that they\u2019re sitting <i>outdoors</i> with <i>no roof</i> above their heads.</p><p>Harry\u2019s scanning his eyes through the menu when the first rain drop falls down on his shoulder, he doesn\u2019t feel it. Then comes a few others on his arms and face causing him to look up at the sky. Large pillows of dark clouds are forming, a very bad sign indeed. Five seconds are all it takes for the rain to come pouring down like a water fall. Harry grabs Y/N\u2019s hand\u00a0as they run to take shelter under the nearest roof, unfortunately, they\u2019re not as dry as before when they get there.</p><p>Harry brushes his wet strands of hair out of his eyes, trying to catch his breath as he turns to Y/N, who doesn\u2019t look any better, all soaked from her head to toes.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m wet, let\u2019s just go home,\u201d Y/N says and Harry stares at her with his eyes and his mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cY/N Y/L/N, we\u2019re in public!\u201d he gasps, instantly receives a playful swat on the chest.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>The heavy downpour obscures the view from Y/N\u2019s bedroom window as the wind and raindrops beat on the glass with violent force. Harry\u2019s a bit glad that they got home just before the heavy shower made it impossible to drive, still and all, he\u2019s also\u00a0disappointed for their date was canceled halfway. It was all perfectly planned out in his head, if it hadn\u2019t been for the series of unfortunate events, tonight could\u2019ve been amazing.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s kneeling on her bed in front of Harry, drying his hair with a towel after she\u2019s finished drying her own.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like rain, always sleep better when it\u2019s raining outside,\u201d she softly says.</p><p>Harry stays still with his legs crossed and hands on his lap, like a little puppy as Y/N takes care of him, and she knows he loves being taken care of. At moments like this, he\u2019s just glad they\u2019re living together.</p><p>Y/N puts the towel aside then grabs Harry\u2019s\u00a0face to peck him on the lips, telling him he\u2019s good to go, but he\u2019s certainly not going anywhere now that he has her under his fingertips.\u00a0As Y/N intends to rise from the bed,\u00a0Harry slides his hands up to her hips, making the young woman flinch and blush a little bit when he slowly guides her to sit on his lap, facing him, legs wrapped around his torso.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing this tank top, huh?\u201d he asks with a husky voice when his eyes make a trip down from her lips to her chest. Y/N swallows hard, shifting a little bit in her flatmate\u2019s lap while his eyes are burning holes on her flushed skin.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s comfy?\u201d she almost whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too revealing. It does things to me.\u201d Harry literally growls as he starts nosing at her jaw, she smells like lavender, and he cannot get enough. Y/N\u2019s eyes fall shut. Her fingers soon find their way to his hair then she feels herself melting into their eager kiss.</p><p>\u201cHarry, we-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers against her lips, his eyes are close, too lost in her scent and taste but he\u2019s\u00a0aware of his own intentions.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna do anything you don\u2019t want to. I just want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s thoroughly surprised by his own words. Of course he\u2019s always got good self-control in situations like this, but whenever he was making out with a girl in bed, one way or another, they ended up fucking. This is something different on a whole new level.\u00a0He\u2019s not gonna lie, he wants Y/N without a doubt. Sometimes when he\u2019s alone, he\u00a0even lets his imagination get a bit too wild with the thoughts of them having sex. But Y/N is\u00a0not one of his hookups, she\u2019s special, and he cannot risk losing something so special by rushing this.\u00a0</p><p>When Harry lays Y/N down on her back, she\u2019s already a mess beneath him, half-heartedly wanting him to take her all at once, but for some unknown reasons, she\u2019s afraid. She\u2019s afraid that this is only special to him because they\u2019re not having sex. As soon as they have sex, it\u2019s very unlikely that everything stays the same. Having gone through all those shitty past relationships, Y/N didn\u2019t want to fly too high to come tumbling down at the end, but now there\u2019s no turning back, so she can only hope he won\u2019t leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cHarry, stop!\u201d Y/N nearly shouts as she sits right up, forcing Harry to do the same. He looks rather shocked than confused by his girlfriend\u2019s reaction when just a few seconds ago she seemed like she really enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cD-did I do something wrong? Did I hurt you?\u201d Harry asks, a painful look displays upon his face.\u00a0Y/N, now is already standing by the bed, shakes her head no as a response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me.\u00a0I\u2026Well\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her sentence is left unfinished, suddenly interrupted by the loud shouting in the hallway. The gay couple next door are arguing again, but this time it seems pretty serious because they start using really harsh words to call each other. Y/N immediately rushes outside to see if they\u2019re alright, and Harry has no choice but to follow her.</p><p>When they open the door, they only see Ben, his fianc\u00e9 Mark has probably left. Ben stands with his head against the door to his flat and he seems absolutely devastated, so Y/N hurriedly walks up to him and asks if he\u2019s okay.</p><p>\u201cHe cheated on me, Y/N,\u201d the poor guy says between sobs. Y/N and Harry exchange looks with each other but no one speaks a word since presumably he still has a lot to say.</p><p>\u201cI saw the texts on his phone to one of his colleagues. I confronted him about it and we argued, then he walked away\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N swallows hard as Ben turns around to give her a hug. She stands like a statue with her hands on his back, letting her heartbroken friend cry on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe said he loved me and that he would change\u2026I should never have believed him.\u201d<br></p><p>The words strike down hard on both Y/N and Harry like a violent hit on the head, each for a different reason. So when they\u2019ve said goodbye and good luck to their distraught neighbor,\u00a0walk back into their flat and close the door, Harry just has to come forward and ask,\u00a0\u201ccan we talk?\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s not in any way fond of those words. Every time she hears it, it\u2019s never news. However, she still calmly turns to face him and gives him a slight nod. Harry takes his seat on the sofa then Y/N follows right after to sit down beside him.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what you thought about tonight,\u201d says Harry as he maintains eye-contact with Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cDespite all the things that happened, I loved it.\u201d Y/N smiles at him.\u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I noticed the way you looked when you heard what Ben said, and your reaction earlier in the bedroom. Is there anything you want to tell me, Y/N?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t tell you, you won\u2019t understand.\u201d<br></p><p>Nothing\u2019s ever hurt her more than the look on his face when she tells him those words. They sit in silence for a couple seconds, then Harry\u2019s the first one to speak up.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not true\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d He frowns, looking so disappointed it breaks her heart.\u00a0\u201cBecause you\u2019re obviously not telling me the truth, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>When he intends to stand up, she immediately grabs onto his arms, eyes begging him not to leave her hanging.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go,\u201d she pleads.</p><p>And he softens all at once.\u00a0\u201cThen tell me what you\u2019re thinking, baby. We promised to be honest to each other no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but promise you won\u2019t be mad?\u201d<br></p><p>He nods and gives her his word.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026The truth is\u2026I was afraid you will leave me once we\u2019ve had sex\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>His eyes grow wide in reaction to her words. Then without saying a single word, he rises from the sofa then marches away, toward his room. Y/N becomes frantic with worry so she chases after him.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t be mad!\u201d<br></p><p>Harry instantly stops, then turns around to face his flatmate who\u2019s standing in front of him with fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you. I\u2019m hurt.\u201d<br></p><p>And Y/N\u2019s speechless. Harry exhales sharply, placing both hands on his hips, and he\u2019s not even looking at her right now.</p><p>\u201cI did everything I could to make you happy, Y/N. I tried to prove to you I\u2019d got better. But how do you expect me to feel when I put so much effort in planning out a date which turned to shit then heard my girlfriend say she thought I only wanted her for sex? It\u2026It seems like no matter what I do, I\u2019m still the same old me to you, never gonna be\u00a0good enough, aren\u2019t I?\u201d<br></p><p>Every word he says is like a knife pierced right through her chest and Y/N feels as if she\u2019s already on the verge of crying. She closes the distance between them then wraps her arms around his torso pulling him in. Harry hugs her back despite how downhearted he is by her,\u00a0because no matter what she says or thinks of him, she\u2019s still the one he loves.</p><p>\u201cYou are always enough,\u201d she mumbles into his shirt, though it\u2019s muffled he still hears every word very clearly.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026When something\u2019s too good to be true happens to you, you cannot help but feel scared you might lose it\u2026You falling in love with me is still very surreal to me. My worst fear is one day you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s all an illusion and whatever feelings you\u2019ve had for me aren\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest shit I\u2019ve heard, Y/N.\u00a0If I could just unlove you, I wouldn\u2019t have gone through so much trouble just to prove it to you I\u2019m worth it.\u201d</p><p>She looks at him timidly, but is now more at ease hearing what he has to say.<br></p><p>\u201cI mean, fuck, have you ever seen me stay up all night to google\u00a0\u2018how to impress a girl on your first date\u2019 before?\u201d Harry rolls his eyes skyward and starts beaming when he hears her\u00a0snort.</p><p>\u201cAnd when I said I only wanted to kiss you, that was <i>really</i> what I meant. I just wanted to kiss you, nothing more. If it was too much, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do it again. <i>But baby</i>\u2026\u201d Harry heavily breathes.\u00a0\u201c\u2026I\u2019m a fool for you, and it\u2019s embarrassing how much I enjoy it.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N is in transports of delight as she\u00a0wraps her arms around his neck. Honestly, she\u00a0thinks she\u2019s even a bigger fool than he is in this relationship, because just a look of his green eyes or his beautiful smile or the way her name sounds on his lips can send her straight on cloud nine. And now he\u2019s standing in front of her, saying all <i>that</i>, Y/N is\u00a0just barely breathing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare not kiss me again, understand you fool?!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, ma\u2019am. Shall we carry on where we left off?\u201d Harry smirks and leans down to reattach their lips, but Y/N is quick to stop him with\u00a0a hand on his chest, slightly pushing him away.</p><p>\u201cLater! Now I\u2019m going to make us dinner. Then we\u2019ll finish our wonderful date night by watching Netflix, you\u2019ll\u00a0get to pick the movie this time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNeed some help in the kitchen?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve done enough, mister! We\u2019re all about gender equality in this house!\u201d Y/N announces loudly as she dances her way into the kitchen, pointing her finger at Harry, who simply\u00a0shakes his head, smiling uncontrollably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p></p>",

He\u2019s never taken a girl out for a romantic dinner or bought her flowers or written love notes. That\u2019s not who he is, well, <i>was</i>, in past tense. Because with Y/N now in the picture, he kind of wants to be that person for her. He\u2019s more than willing to change, which, he believes, shouldn\u2019t be too hard since he hasn\u2019t been the same since they first met. However, he cannot help but feel like there\u2019s still so much more to work on. After all, he doesn\u2019t want Y/N to leave him, that\u2019s the thing he fears the most.</p><p>\u201cI want to take you out on a date,\u201d he says to her the next morning, one day after their first kiss. \u201cI stayed up last night to plan the whole thing, you just need to say yes.\u201d</p><p>Y/N, still in her PJ, stares at Harry from her bedroom door with her eyes widened. </p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to.\u201d She crosses her arms in front of her chest. \u201cWe hang out all the time, and we\u2019re also living together! I mean, you fell asleep in my bed last night during The Notebook! We already look like a married couple to me, we don\u2019t need a fancy date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Yes, we do.\u201d Harry scoffs. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be boyfriend and girlfriend, you\u2019re getting a proper first date!\u201d</p><p>They\u2019ve never discussed this topic before, but Y/N honestly finds him referring to them as boyfriend and girlfriend kind of sexy. She immediately walks up to Harry and throws both arms around his neck, as a result, making him smile so wide.</p><p>\u201cI like this Harry. Let\u2019s keep him.\u201d Y/N\u2019s comment makes her flatmate chuckle. He cocks his head to the side and rests his hands gently on her lower back. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere. I guarantee,\u201d Harry tells Y/N with certainty.</p><p>\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>Y/N spends almost two hours digging through her closet, trying on clothes for her date with Harry tonight. She eventually comes to a decision to wear this basic flowered black dress she hasn\u2019t worn again since her sixteenth birthday, because her boyfriend back then said it made her look old. But when Harry finally sees Y/N in that dress, he\u00a0tells her without a second thought that she looks \u2018<i>very beautiful\u2019</i>. He could lie and she wouldn\u2019t care, she\u2019s never been more sure of her feelings for anyone else.</p><p>On their way leaving their flat, Harry and Y/N run into their next door neighbor Ben who just came back home from work. In contrast to the cheerfulness on the young couple\u2019s faces, the man appears a bit irritated and upset, though he immediately hides that look behind a smile when he sees them.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, lovelies. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026Dinner,\u201d is Harry\u2019s answer as he exchanges looks with Y/N, such behavior can never pass the eyes of their experienced neighbor.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, are you two going on <i>a date</i>?\u201d he gasps, only receiving two smiles as a confirmation but that\u2019s all he needs.</p><p>\u201c<i>Finally</i>! I was rooting for you guys!\u201d Ben squeals, clapping his hands excitedly.\u00a0\u201cWait until the gossip lady downstairs hear about this! She thinks\u00a0getting money from me is easy? I\u2019ll show her!\u201d</p><p>Harry stares at the older guy with bulging eyes.\u00a0\u201cBen, you made a bet on us?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooooo, I actually made a bet on <i>you</i>. That woman said you would chicken out but I believed in you mate.\u201d\u00a0Ben gives Harry a pat on the back, making\u00a0Y/N crack up whilst Harry just stands there squinting his eyes, unsure whether he should get upset or say thank you.</p><p>\u201cSo which one of you made the first move? How did this happen exactly?\u201d Ben asks, quickly switching his finger back and forth from Harry to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>The pair just look at each other, shrug and speak at the same time,\u00a0\u201clong story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say! Couples who speak together stay together!\u201d Ben says as he turns the key to open his front door.\u00a0\u201cSorry, that was rude of me to take so much of your time. You kids have fun on your date, okay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a lovely night, Ben!\u201d Y/N tells him with a smile, and when she turns away, Ben secretly winks at Harry and gives the young man, who\u2019s grinning from ear to ear,\u00a0an encouraging thumb up.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>It only takes fifteen minutes driving to their dinner location, but Harry swears those fifteen minutes seem like a whole fucking lifetime. He remembers his first time going to school, his first time going to the hospital after breaking his arm, his first kiss, and first time having sex, none of those things made Harry as nervous as he is now. Just the simple thought of Y/N not liking the food or service at the restaurant makes his palms heavily sweat. Then he starts to wonder to himself how some of his friends can make going on dates look so easy.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s worry doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. As soon as she sees him puckering his forehead while tapping his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel, she immediately reaches for his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress too much.\u00a0You could just take me to McDonald\u2019s and I\u2019d still be very very happy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry blurts out. \u201c<i>I love you</i>.\u201d</p><p>It was supposed to be a thought in his head only, but the words slipped right out before Harry could even stop himself. As a result, his\u00a0face\u00a0turns bright red. Little does he know, Y/N swoons over those words just like the first time he said them to her. She\u00a0leans over from the passenger seat to kiss him on the cheek, then lets him know that she loves him too.</p><p>The traffic is clear tonight so Harry and Y/N arrive at the restaurant a little sooner than scheduled.\u00a0When they walk in, the place is already packed which is\u00a0understandable for it\u2019s Saturday night. Harry\u2019s told Y/N that this is the best restaurant nearby, he knows it because he came here once with his sister when she was still in town and he\u2019s wanted to take Y/N here ever since.</p><p>\u201cTable for two. Harry Styles. 7 PM.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSir, I apologize for the inconvenience but your table may still not be ready yet. You would have to\u00a0wait another five minutes, would it be alright?\u201d says the small lady in the uniform. </p><p>Harry presses his lips into a smile and tells her they don\u2019t mind at all, then watches her hurry\u00a0back inside, probably to take care of his reservation. Harry takes a quick glance at Y/N, who\u2019s holding his hand and grinning to herself, that\u2019s all it takes to boost Harry\u2019s\u00a0confidence to the max. Usually he\u2019s not into sappy stuff like this, but now he finds going on a date strangely enjoyable.\u00a0As long as she\u2019s happy, he\u2019s happy.</p><p><i>However</i>, the enjoyment doesn\u2019t last long for Harry, because he quickly recognizes a familiar face in the crowded room. That young waitress is too busy writing down orders to spot Harry at the entrance. The problem is, she\u2019s not just a familiar waitress.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not eat here! I\u2019m taking you somewhere else, okay?\u201d Harry speaks fast and grabs Y/N by the hand to pull her out of the waiting line.\u00a0</p><p>The lady from earlier calls after Harry to say his table\u2019s ready, still he ignores her, and keeps on walking away. Poor Y/N doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, too confused to even protest and just lets her date lead them back to the street without any clear explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She asks once they\u2019re already outside.\u00a0</p><p>Harry heaves out a sigh as he reads her facial expression, thinking they haven\u2019t got to dinner yet and he\u2019s already made her mad. There\u2019s no point making things up\u00a0now, so he straight off tells\u00a0her he knows a waitress in there and is not comfortable of running into her.\u00a0</p><p>He wants to curse himself out loud for the look on Y/N\u2019s face when she comes to realization. He wants to change, but he cannot change his past and he feels threatened by the possibility of it one day being the reason Y/N walks away from him and never returns. He hangs his head and apologizes for what happened, even though it wasn\u2019t his plan to run into one of his one-night-stands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay really.\u201d Y/N takes a step closer to Harry then presses her palm to his cheek.\u00a0\u201cThanks for being honest with me. Let\u2019s just\u00a0go back inside, I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p><i>It\u2019s confirmed,</i> he thinks. <i>She\u2019s an angel.</i></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to have her serve us dinner. It\u2019d be really weird and uncomfortable. Tonight should only be me and you, no other distractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do you have a back up plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Harry nods with confidence. A wise man always has a back up plan, and he believes he\u2019s a <i>very</i> wise man.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Harry\u2019s back up plan is his second favorite restaurant in this area, he also went here once with his sister, to whom he owes a thank you after tonight.\u00a0This restaurant is smaller and cheaper than the first one, but it\u2019s\u00a0outdoors, which he thinks Y/N may like since they\u2019ll be eating in a garden, surrounded by fairy lights, under the stars. If this isn\u2019t romantic, Harry doesn\u2019t know what is.</p><p>\u201cThis place is beautiful,\u201d Y/N exclaims as she grabs a menu on the table. Harry does the same with a huge smirk on his face, pretty proud of himself for successfully planning out this perfect dinner. It almost seems like nothing else can go wrong.</p><p><i>But\u2026</i></p><p>Yes, there\u2019s been a lot of \u2018<i>buts</i>\u2019 tonight. The biggest problem Harry doesn\u2019t seem the notice yet, is the fact that they\u2019re sitting <i>outdoors</i> with <i>no roof</i> above their heads.</p><p>Harry\u2019s scanning his eyes through the menu when the first rain drop falls down on his shoulder, he doesn\u2019t feel it. Then comes a few others on his arms and face causing him to look up at the sky. Large pillows of dark clouds are forming, a very bad sign indeed. Five seconds are all it takes for the rain to come pouring down like a water fall. Harry grabs Y/N\u2019s hand\u00a0as they run to take shelter under the nearest roof, unfortunately, they\u2019re not as dry as before when they get there.</p><p>Harry brushes his wet strands of hair out of his eyes, trying to catch his breath as he turns to Y/N, who doesn\u2019t look any better, all soaked from her head to toes.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m wet, let\u2019s just go home,\u201d Y/N says and Harry stares at her with his eyes and his mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cY/N Y/L/N, we\u2019re in public!\u201d he gasps, instantly receives a playful swat on the chest.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>The heavy downpour obscures the view from Y/N\u2019s bedroom window as the wind and raindrops beat on the glass with violent force. Harry\u2019s a bit glad that they got home just before the heavy shower made it impossible to drive, still and all, he\u2019s also\u00a0disappointed for their date was canceled halfway. It was all perfectly planned out in his head, if it hadn\u2019t been for the series of unfortunate events, tonight could\u2019ve been amazing.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s kneeling on her bed in front of Harry, drying his hair with a towel after she\u2019s finished drying her own.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like rain, always sleep better when it\u2019s raining outside,\u201d she softly says.</p><p>Harry stays still with his legs crossed and hands on his lap, like a little puppy as Y/N takes care of him, and she knows he loves being taken care of. At moments like this, he\u2019s just glad they\u2019re living together.</p><p>Y/N puts the towel aside then grabs Harry\u2019s\u00a0face to peck him on the lips, telling him he\u2019s good to go, but he\u2019s certainly not going anywhere now that he has her under his fingertips.\u00a0As Y/N intends to rise from the bed,\u00a0Harry slides his hands up to her hips, making the young woman flinch and blush a little bit when he slowly guides her to sit on his lap, facing him, legs wrapped around his torso.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing this tank top, huh?\u201d he asks with a husky voice when his eyes make a trip down from her lips to her chest. Y/N swallows hard, shifting a little bit in her flatmate\u2019s lap while his eyes are burning holes on her flushed skin.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s comfy?\u201d she almost whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too revealing. It does things to me.\u201d Harry literally growls as he starts nosing at her jaw, she smells like lavender, and he cannot get enough. Y/N\u2019s eyes fall shut. Her fingers soon find their way to his hair then she feels herself melting into their eager kiss.</p><p>\u201cHarry, we-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers against her lips, his eyes are close, too lost in her scent and taste but he\u2019s\u00a0aware of his own intentions.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna do anything you don\u2019t want to. I just want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s thoroughly surprised by his own words. Of course he\u2019s always got good self-control in situations like this, but whenever he was making out with a girl in bed, one way or another, they ended up fucking. This is something different on a whole new level.\u00a0He\u2019s not gonna lie, he wants Y/N without a doubt. Sometimes when he\u2019s alone, he\u00a0even lets his imagination get a bit too wild with the thoughts of them having sex. But Y/N is\u00a0not one of his hookups, she\u2019s special, and he cannot risk losing something so special by rushing this.\u00a0</p><p>When Harry lays Y/N down on her back, she\u2019s already a mess beneath him, half-heartedly wanting him to take her all at once, but for some unknown reasons, she\u2019s afraid. She\u2019s afraid that this is only special to him because they\u2019re not having sex. As soon as they have sex, it\u2019s very unlikely that everything stays the same. Having gone through all those shitty past relationships, Y/N didn\u2019t want to fly too high to come tumbling down at the end, but now there\u2019s no turning back, so she can only hope he won\u2019t leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cHarry, stop!\u201d Y/N nearly shouts as she sits right up, forcing Harry to do the same. He looks rather shocked than confused by his girlfriend\u2019s reaction when just a few seconds ago she seemed like she really enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cD-did I do something wrong? Did I hurt you?\u201d Harry asks, a painful look displays upon his face.\u00a0Y/N, now is already standing by the bed, shakes her head no as a response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me.\u00a0I\u2026Well\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her sentence is left unfinished, suddenly interrupted by the loud shouting in the hallway. The gay couple next door are arguing again, but this time it seems pretty serious because they start using really harsh words to call each other. Y/N immediately rushes outside to see if they\u2019re alright, and Harry has no choice but to follow her.</p><p>When they open the door, they only see Ben, his fianc\u00e9 Mark has probably left. Ben stands with his head against the door to his flat and he seems absolutely devastated, so Y/N hurriedly walks up to him and asks if he\u2019s okay.</p><p>\u201cHe cheated on me, Y/N,\u201d the poor guy says between sobs. Y/N and Harry exchange looks with each other but no one speaks a word since presumably he still has a lot to say.</p><p>\u201cI saw the texts on his phone to one of his colleagues. I confronted him about it and we argued, then he walked away\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N swallows hard as Ben turns around to give her a hug. She stands like a statue with her hands on his back, letting her heartbroken friend cry on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe said he loved me and that he would change\u2026I should never have believed him.\u201d<br></p><p>The words strike down hard on both Y/N and Harry like a violent hit on the head, each for a different reason. So when they\u2019ve said goodbye and good luck to their distraught neighbor,\u00a0walk back into their flat and close the door, Harry just has to come forward and ask,\u00a0\u201ccan we talk?\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s not in any way fond of those words. Every time she hears it, it\u2019s never news. However, she still calmly turns to face him and gives him a slight nod. Harry takes his seat on the sofa then Y/N follows right after to sit down beside him.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what you thought about tonight,\u201d says Harry as he maintains eye-contact with Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cDespite all the things that happened, I loved it.\u201d Y/N smiles at him.\u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I noticed the way you looked when you heard what Ben said, and your reaction earlier in the bedroom. Is there anything you want to tell me, Y/N?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t tell you, you won\u2019t understand.\u201d<br></p><p>Nothing\u2019s ever hurt her more than the look on his face when she tells him those words. They sit in silence for a couple seconds, then Harry\u2019s the first one to speak up.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not true\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d He frowns, looking so disappointed it breaks her heart.\u00a0\u201cBecause you\u2019re obviously not telling me the truth, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>When he intends to stand up, she immediately grabs onto his arms, eyes begging him not to leave her hanging.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go,\u201d she pleads.</p><p>And he softens all at once.\u00a0\u201cThen tell me what you\u2019re thinking, baby. We promised to be honest to each other no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but promise you won\u2019t be mad?\u201d<br></p><p>He nods and gives her his word.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026The truth is\u2026I was afraid you will leave me once we\u2019ve had sex\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>His eyes grow wide in reaction to her words. Then without saying a single word, he rises from the sofa then marches away, toward his room. Y/N becomes frantic with worry so she chases after him.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t be mad!\u201d<br></p><p>Harry instantly stops, then turns around to face his flatmate who\u2019s standing in front of him with fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you. I\u2019m hurt.\u201d<br></p><p>And Y/N\u2019s speechless. Harry exhales sharply, placing both hands on his hips, and he\u2019s not even looking at her right now.</p><p>\u201cI did everything I could to make you happy, Y/N. I tried to prove to you I\u2019d got better. But how do you expect me to feel when I put so much effort in planning out a date which turned to shit then heard my girlfriend say she thought I only wanted her for sex? It\u2026It seems like no matter what I do, I\u2019m still the same old me to you, never gonna be\u00a0good enough, aren\u2019t I?\u201d<br></p><p>Every word he says is like a knife pierced right through her chest and Y/N feels as if she\u2019s already on the verge of crying. She closes the distance between them then wraps her arms around his torso pulling him in. Harry hugs her back despite how downhearted he is by her,\u00a0because no matter what she says or thinks of him, she\u2019s still the one he loves.</p><p>\u201cYou are always enough,\u201d she mumbles into his shirt, though it\u2019s muffled he still hears every word very clearly.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026When something\u2019s too good to be true happens to you, you cannot help but feel scared you might lose it\u2026You falling in love with me is still very surreal to me. My worst fear is one day you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s all an illusion and whatever feelings you\u2019ve had for me aren\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest shit I\u2019ve heard, Y/N.\u00a0If I could just unlove you, I wouldn\u2019t have gone through so much trouble just to prove it to you I\u2019m worth it.\u201d</p><p>She looks at him timidly, but is now more at ease hearing what he has to say.<br></p><p>\u201cI mean, fuck, have you ever seen me stay up all night to google\u00a0\u2018how to impress a girl on your first date\u2019 before?\u201d Harry rolls his eyes skyward and starts beaming when he hears her\u00a0snort.</p><p>\u201cAnd when I said I only wanted to kiss you, that was <i>really</i> what I meant. I just wanted to kiss you, nothing more. If it was too much, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do it again. <i>But baby</i>\u2026\u201d Harry heavily breathes.\u00a0\u201c\u2026I\u2019m a fool for you, and it\u2019s embarrassing how much I enjoy it.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N is in transports of delight as she\u00a0wraps her arms around his neck. Honestly, she\u00a0thinks she\u2019s even a bigger fool than he is in this relationship, because just a look of his green eyes or his beautiful smile or the way her name sounds on his lips can send her straight on cloud nine. And now he\u2019s standing in front of her, saying all <i>that</i>, Y/N is\u00a0just barely breathing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare not kiss me again, understand you fool?!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, ma\u2019am. Shall we carry on where we left off?\u201d Harry smirks and leans down to reattach their lips, but Y/N is quick to stop him with\u00a0a hand on his chest, slightly pushing him away.</p><p>\u201cLater! Now I\u2019m going to make us dinner. Then we\u2019ll finish our wonderful date night by watching Netflix, you\u2019ll\u00a0get to pick the movie this time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNeed some help in the kitchen?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve done enough, mister! We\u2019re all about gender equality in this house!\u201d Y/N announces loudly as she dances her way into the kitchen, pointing her finger at Harry, who simply\u00a0shakes his head, smiling uncontrollably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p></p>",

After all, he doesn&rsquo;t want Y/N to leave him, that&rsquo;s the thing he fears the most.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to take you out on a date,&rdquo; he says to her the next morning, one day after their first kiss. &ldquo;I stayed up last night to plan the whole thing, you just need to say yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N, still in her PJ, stares at Harry from her bedroom door with her eyes widened. </p><p>&ldquo;You really didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; She crosses her arms in front of her chest. &ldquo;We hang out all the time, and we&rsquo;re also living together! I mean, you fell asleep in my bed last night during The Notebook! We already look like a married couple to me, we don&rsquo;t need a fancy date.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me? Yes, we do.&rdquo; Harry scoffs. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to be boyfriend and girlfriend, you&rsquo;re getting a proper first date!&rdquo;</p><p>They&rsquo;ve never discussed this topic before, but Y/N honestly finds him referring to them as boyfriend and girlfriend kind of sexy. She immediately walks up to Harry and throws both arms around his neck, as a result, making him smile so wide.</p><p>&ldquo;I like this Harry. Let&rsquo;s keep him.&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s comment makes her flatmate chuckle. He cocks his head to the side and rests his hands gently on her lower back. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going anywhere. I guarantee,&rdquo; Harry tells Y/N with certainty.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Y/N spends almost two hours digging through her closet, trying on clothes for her date with Harry tonight. She eventually comes to a decision to wear this basic flowered black dress she hasn&rsquo;t worn again since her sixteenth birthday, because her boyfriend back then said it made her look old. But when Harry finally sees Y/N in that dress, he&nbsp;tells her without a second thought that she looks &lsquo;<i>very beautiful&rsquo;</i>. He could lie and she wouldn&rsquo;t care, she&rsquo;s never been more sure of her feelings for anyone else.</p><p>On their way leaving their flat, Harry and Y/N run into their next door neighbor Ben who just came back home from work. In contrast to the cheerfulness on the young couple&rsquo;s faces, the man appears a bit irritated and upset, though he immediately hides that look behind a smile when he sees them.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening, lovelies. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;Dinner,&rdquo; is Harry&rsquo;s answer as he exchanges looks with Y/N, such behavior can never pass the eyes of their experienced neighbor.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God, are you two going on <i>a date</i>?&rdquo; he gasps, only receiving two smiles as a confirmation but that&rsquo;s all he needs.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Finally</i>! I was rooting for you guys!&rdquo; Ben squeals, clapping his hands excitedly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait until the gossip lady downstairs hear about this! She thinks&nbsp;getting money from me is easy? I&rsquo;ll show her!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stares at the older guy with bulging eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ben, you made a bet on us?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nooooo, I actually made a bet on <i>you</i>. That woman said you would chicken out but I believed in you mate.&rdquo;&nbsp;Ben gives Harry a pat on the back, making&nbsp;Y/N crack up whilst Harry just stands there squinting his eyes, unsure whether he should get upset or say thank you.</p><p>&ldquo;So which one of you made the first move? How did this happen exactly?&rdquo; Ben asks, quickly switching his finger back and forth from Harry to Y/N.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair just look at each other, shrug and speak at the same time,&nbsp;&ldquo;long story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what they say! Couples who speak together stay together!&rdquo; Ben says as he turns the key to open his front door.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, that was rude of me to take so much of your time. You kids have fun on your date, okay!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a lovely night, Ben!&rdquo; Y/N tells him with a smile, and when she turns away, Ben secretly winks at Harry and gives the young man, who&rsquo;s grinning from ear to ear,&nbsp;an encouraging thumb up.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>It only takes fifteen minutes driving to their dinner location, but Harry swears those fifteen minutes seem like a whole fucking lifetime. He remembers his first time going to school, his first time going to the hospital after breaking his arm, his first kiss, and first time having sex, none of those things made Harry as nervous as he is now. Just the simple thought of Y/N not liking the food or service at the restaurant makes his palms heavily sweat. Then he starts to wonder to himself how some of his friends can make going on dates look so easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s worry doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed. As soon as she sees him puckering his forehead while tapping his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel, she immediately reaches for his shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stress too much.&nbsp;You could just take me to McDonald&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;d still be very very happy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Harry blurts out. &ldquo;<i>I love you</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>It was supposed to be a thought in his head only, but the words slipped right out before Harry could even stop himself. As a result, his&nbsp;face&nbsp;turns bright red. Little does he know, Y/N swoons over those words just like the first time he said them to her. She&nbsp;leans over from the passenger seat to kiss him on the cheek, then lets him know that she loves him too.</p><p>The traffic is clear tonight so Harry and Y/N arrive at the restaurant a little sooner than scheduled.&nbsp;When they walk in, the place is already packed which is&nbsp;understandable for it&rsquo;s Saturday night. Harry&rsquo;s told Y/N that this is the best restaurant nearby, he knows it because he came here once with his sister when she was still in town and he&rsquo;s wanted to take Y/N here ever since.</p><p>&ldquo;Table for two. Harry Styles. 7 PM.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, I apologize for the inconvenience but your table may still not be ready yet. You would have to&nbsp;wait another five minutes, would it be alright?&rdquo; says the small lady in the uniform. </p><p>Harry presses his lips into a smile and tells her they don&rsquo;t mind at all, then watches her hurry&nbsp;back inside, probably to take care of his reservation. Harry takes a quick glance at Y/N, who&rsquo;s holding his hand and grinning to herself, that&rsquo;s all it takes to boost Harry&rsquo;s&nbsp;confidence to the max. Usually he&rsquo;s not into sappy stuff like this, but now he finds going on a date strangely enjoyable.&nbsp;As long as she&rsquo;s happy, he&rsquo;s happy.</p><p><i>However</i>, the enjoyment doesn&rsquo;t last long for Harry, because he quickly recognizes a familiar face in the crowded room. That young waitress is too busy writing down orders to spot Harry at the entrance. The problem is, she&rsquo;s not just a familiar waitress.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not eat here! I&rsquo;m taking you somewhere else, okay?&rdquo; Harry speaks fast and grabs Y/N by the hand to pull her out of the waiting line.&nbsp;</p><p>The lady from earlier calls after Harry to say his table&rsquo;s ready, still he ignores her, and keeps on walking away. Poor Y/N doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on, too confused to even protest and just lets her date lead them back to the street without any clear explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; She asks once they&rsquo;re already outside.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry heaves out a sigh as he reads her facial expression, thinking they haven&rsquo;t got to dinner yet and he&rsquo;s already made her mad. There&rsquo;s no point making things up&nbsp;now, so he straight off tells&nbsp;her he knows a waitress in there and is not comfortable of running into her.&nbsp;</p><p>He wants to curse himself out loud for the look on Y/N&rsquo;s face when she comes to realization. He wants to change, but he cannot change his past and he feels threatened by the possibility of it one day being the reason Y/N walks away from him and never returns. He hangs his head and apologizes for what happened, even though it wasn&rsquo;t his plan to run into one of his one-night-stands.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay really.&rdquo; Y/N takes a step closer to Harry then presses her palm to his cheek.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks for being honest with me. Let&rsquo;s just&nbsp;go back inside, I won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p><i>It&rsquo;s confirmed,</i> he thinks. <i>She&rsquo;s an angel.</i></p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to have her serve us dinner. It&rsquo;d be really weird and uncomfortable. Tonight should only be me and you, no other distractions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then do you have a back up plan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo; Harry nods with confidence. A wise man always has a back up plan, and he believes he&rsquo;s a <i>very</i> wise man.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Harry&rsquo;s back up plan is his second favorite restaurant in this area, he also went here once with his sister, to whom he owes a thank you after tonight.&nbsp;This restaurant is smaller and cheaper than the first one, but it&rsquo;s&nbsp;outdoors, which he thinks Y/N may like since they&rsquo;ll be eating in a garden, surrounded by fairy lights, under the stars. If this isn&rsquo;t romantic, Harry doesn&rsquo;t know what is.</p><p>&ldquo;This place is beautiful,&rdquo; Y/N exclaims as she grabs a menu on the table. Harry does the same with a huge smirk on his face, pretty proud of himself for successfully planning out this perfect dinner. It almost seems like nothing else can go wrong.</p><p><i>But&hellip;</i></p><p>Yes, there&rsquo;s been a lot of &lsquo;<i>buts</i>&rsquo; tonight. The biggest problem Harry doesn&rsquo;t seem the notice yet, is the fact that they&rsquo;re sitting <i>outdoors</i> with <i>no roof</i> above their heads.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s scanning his eyes through the menu when the first rain drop falls down on his shoulder, he doesn&rsquo;t feel it. Then comes a few others on his arms and face causing him to look up at the sky. Large pillows of dark clouds are forming, a very bad sign indeed. Five seconds are all it takes for the rain to come pouring down like a water fall. Harry grabs Y/N&rsquo;s hand&nbsp;as they run to take shelter under the nearest roof, unfortunately, they&rsquo;re not as dry as before when they get there.</p><p>Harry brushes his wet strands of hair out of his eyes, trying to catch his breath as he turns to Y/N, who doesn&rsquo;t look any better, all soaked from her head to toes.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I&rsquo;m wet, let&rsquo;s just go home,&rdquo; Y/N says and Harry stares at her with his eyes and his mouth wide open.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N Y/L/N, we&rsquo;re in public!&rdquo; he gasps, instantly receives a playful swat on the chest.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br /></p><p>The heavy downpour obscures the view from Y/N&rsquo;s bedroom window as the wind and raindrops beat on the glass with violent force. Harry&rsquo;s a bit glad that they got home just before the heavy shower made it impossible to drive, still and all, he&rsquo;s also&nbsp;disappointed for their date was canceled halfway. It was all perfectly planned out in his head, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the series of unfortunate events, tonight could&rsquo;ve been amazing.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s kneeling on her bed in front of Harry, drying his hair with a towel after she&rsquo;s finished drying her own.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I like rain, always sleep better when it&rsquo;s raining outside,&rdquo; she softly says.</p><p>Harry stays still with his legs crossed and hands on his lap, like a little puppy as Y/N takes care of him, and she knows he loves being taken care of. At moments like this, he&rsquo;s just glad they&rsquo;re living together.</p><p>Y/N puts the towel aside then grabs Harry&rsquo;s&nbsp;face to peck him on the lips, telling him he&rsquo;s good to go, but he&rsquo;s certainly not going anywhere now that he has her under his fingertips.&nbsp;As Y/N intends to rise from the bed,&nbsp;Harry slides his hands up to her hips, making the young woman flinch and blush a little bit when he slowly guides her to sit on his lap, facing him, legs wrapped around his torso.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you wearing this tank top, huh?&rdquo; he asks with a husky voice when his eyes make a trip down from her lips to her chest. Y/N swallows hard, shifting a little bit in her flatmate&rsquo;s lap while his eyes are burning holes on her flushed skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s comfy?&rdquo; she almost whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too revealing. It does things to me.&rdquo; Harry literally growls as he starts nosing at her jaw, she smells like lavender, and he cannot get enough. Y/N&rsquo;s eyes fall shut. Her fingers soon find their way to his hair then she feels herself melting into their eager kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, we-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he whispers against her lips, his eyes are close, too lost in her scent and taste but he&rsquo;s&nbsp;aware of his own intentions.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not gonna do anything you don&rsquo;t want to. I just want to kiss you.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s thoroughly surprised by his own words. Of course he&rsquo;s always got good self-control in situations like this, but whenever he was making out with a girl in bed, one way or another, they ended up fucking. This is something different on a whole new level.&nbsp;He&rsquo;s not gonna lie, he wants Y/N without a doubt. Sometimes when he&rsquo;s alone, he&nbsp;even lets his imagination get a bit too wild with the thoughts of them having sex. But Y/N is&nbsp;not one of his hookups, she&rsquo;s special, and he cannot risk losing something so special by rushing this.&nbsp;</p><p>When Harry lays Y/N down on her back, she&rsquo;s already a mess beneath him, half-heartedly wanting him to take her all at once, but for some unknown reasons, she&rsquo;s afraid. She&rsquo;s afraid that this is only special to him because they&rsquo;re not having sex. As soon as they have sex, it&rsquo;s very unlikely that everything stays the same. Having gone through all those shitty past relationships, Y/N didn&rsquo;t want to fly too high to come tumbling down at the end, but now there&rsquo;s no turning back, so she can only hope he won&rsquo;t leave her alone.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, stop!&rdquo; Y/N nearly shouts as she sits right up, forcing Harry to do the same. He looks rather shocked than confused by his girlfriend&rsquo;s reaction when just a few seconds ago she seemed like she really enjoyed it.</p><p>&ldquo;D-did I do something wrong? Did I hurt you?&rdquo; Harry asks, a painful look displays upon his face.&nbsp;Y/N, now is already standing by the bed, shakes her head no as a response.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hurt me.&nbsp;I&hellip;Well&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Her sentence is left unfinished, suddenly interrupted by the loud shouting in the hallway. The gay couple next door are arguing again, but this time it seems pretty serious because they start using really harsh words to call each other. Y/N immediately rushes outside to see if they&rsquo;re alright, and Harry has no choice but to follow her.</p><p>When they open the door, they only see Ben, his fianc&eacute; Mark has probably left. Ben stands with his head against the door to his flat and he seems absolutely devastated, so Y/N hurriedly walks up to him and asks if he&rsquo;s okay.</p><p>&ldquo;He cheated on me, Y/N,&rdquo; the poor guy says between sobs. Y/N and Harry exchange looks with each other but no one speaks a word since presumably he still has a lot to say.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw the texts on his phone to one of his colleagues. I confronted him about it and we argued, then he walked away&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N swallows hard as Ben turns around to give her a hug. She stands like a statue with her hands on his back, letting her heartbroken friend cry on her shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;He said he loved me and that he would change&hellip;I should never have believed him.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The words strike down hard on both Y/N and Harry like a violent hit on the head, each for a different reason. So when they&rsquo;ve said goodbye and good luck to their distraught neighbor,&nbsp;walk back into their flat and close the door, Harry just has to come forward and ask,&nbsp;&ldquo;can we talk?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s not in any way fond of those words. Every time she hears it, it&rsquo;s never news. However, she still calmly turns to face him and gives him a slight nod. Harry takes his seat on the sofa then Y/N follows right after to sit down beside him.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to know what you thought about tonight,&rdquo; says Harry as he maintains eye-contact with Y/N.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Despite all the things that happened, I loved it.&rdquo; Y/N smiles at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I noticed the way you looked when you heard what Ben said, and your reaction earlier in the bedroom. Is there anything you want to tell me, Y/N?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I can&rsquo;t tell you, you won&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Nothing&rsquo;s ever hurt her more than the look on his face when she tells him those words. They sit in silence for a couple seconds, then Harry&rsquo;s the first one to speak up.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;not true&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then what is?&rdquo; He frowns, looking so disappointed it breaks her heart.&nbsp;&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re obviously not telling me the truth, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>When he intends to stand up, she immediately grabs onto his arms, eyes begging him not to leave her hanging.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she pleads.</p><p>And he softens all at once.&nbsp;&ldquo;Then tell me what you&rsquo;re thinking, baby. We promised to be honest to each other no matter what.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, but promise you won&rsquo;t be mad?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He nods and gives her his word.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;The truth is&hellip;I was afraid you will leave me once we&rsquo;ve had sex&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>His eyes grow wide in reaction to her words. Then without saying a single word, he rises from the sofa then marches away, toward his room. Y/N becomes frantic with worry so she chases after him.</p><p>&ldquo;You promised you wouldn&rsquo;t be mad!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry instantly stops, then turns around to face his flatmate who&rsquo;s standing in front of him with fear in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad at you. I&rsquo;m hurt.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>And Y/N&rsquo;s speechless. Harry exhales sharply, placing both hands on his hips, and he&rsquo;s not even looking at her right now.</p><p>&ldquo;I did everything I could to make you happy, Y/N. I tried to prove to you I&rsquo;d got better. But how do you expect me to feel when I put so much effort in planning out a date which turned to shit then heard my girlfriend say she thought I only wanted her for sex? It&hellip;It seems like no matter what I do, I&rsquo;m still the same old me to you, never gonna be&nbsp;good enough, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Every word he says is like a knife pierced right through her chest and Y/N feels as if she&rsquo;s already on the verge of crying. She closes the distance between them then wraps her arms around his torso pulling him in. Harry hugs her back despite how downhearted he is by her,&nbsp;because no matter what she says or thinks of him, she&rsquo;s still the one he loves.</p><p>&ldquo;You are always enough,&rdquo; she mumbles into his shirt, though it&rsquo;s muffled he still hears every word very clearly.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;When something&rsquo;s too good to be true happens to you, you cannot help but feel scared you might lose it&hellip;You falling in love with me is still very surreal to me. My worst fear is one day you&rsquo;ll realize that it&rsquo;s all an illusion and whatever feelings you&rsquo;ve had for me aren&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dumbest shit I&rsquo;ve heard, Y/N.&nbsp;If I could just unlove you, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone through so much trouble just to prove it to you I&rsquo;m worth it.&rdquo;</p><p>She looks at him timidly, but is now more at ease hearing what he has to say.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean, fuck, have you ever seen me stay up all night to google&nbsp;&lsquo;how to impress a girl on your first date&rsquo; before?&rdquo; Harry rolls his eyes skyward and starts beaming when he hears her&nbsp;snort.</p><p>&ldquo;And when I said I only wanted to kiss you, that was <i>really</i> what I meant. I just wanted to kiss you, nothing more. If it was too much, I&rsquo;m sorry, I won&rsquo;t do it again. <i>But baby</i>&hellip;&rdquo; Harry heavily breathes.&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m a fool for you, and it&rsquo;s embarrassing how much I enjoy it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N is in transports of delight as she&nbsp;wraps her arms around his neck. Honestly, she&nbsp;thinks she&rsquo;s even a bigger fool than he is in this relationship, because just a look of his green eyes or his beautiful smile or the way her name sounds on his lips can send her straight on cloud nine. And now he&rsquo;s standing in front of her, saying all <i>that</i>, Y/N is&nbsp;just barely breathing.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare not kiss me again, understand you fool?!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, ma&rsquo;am. Shall we carry on where we left off?&rdquo; Harry smirks and leans down to reattach their lips, but Y/N is quick to stop him with&nbsp;a hand on his chest, slightly pushing him away.</p><p>&ldquo;Later! Now I&rsquo;m going to make us dinner. Then we&rsquo;ll finish our wonderful date night by watching Netflix, you&rsquo;ll&nbsp;get to pick the movie this time.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Need some help in the kitchen?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ve done enough, mister! We&rsquo;re all about gender equality in this house!&rdquo; Y/N announces loudly as she dances her way into the kitchen, pointing her finger at Harry, who simply&nbsp;shakes his head, smiling uncontrollably.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my girl.&rdquo;</p></p>",
