He knew it with all his heart and even more so with his body. He couldn\u2019t tell when he knew it, but he remembered when he realized it. <br/></p><p>It had been a rather cold evening, (Y/N) and him had been walking back to her apartment from a dinner with some friends of hers. They had been holding hands the whole way back, until he had suddenly heard her gasp before she had stopped walking. <br/></p><p>\u201cH, look\u201d, she had whispered, crouching down on the ground and pointing into a bush on the other side of the road. <br/></p><p>\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d, he had asked, majorly confused, but he still had crouched down beside her on the pavement. He had squinted in the mere direction of where she had pointed, but couldn\u2019t see a reason to be looking there. So he had turned around, looking at his girl instead, and seeing the most adorable smile on her face. Her eyes had glistened from excitement as she had clutched his arm. It was heartwarming, really. <br/></p><p>\u201c \u2018t was a bunny\u201d, she said, \u201cit\u2019s been running into the bush, but maybe it\u2019ll come back out if we wait.\u201d Her eyes had never left the bush where the bunny had disappeared into, and her smile hadn\u2019t faltered. <br/></p><p>And that\u2019s when he knew. Because he\u2019d stay there for hours, watching a bush where a stupid bunny disappeared into, freezing. All for her, so she wouldn\u2019t stop smiling. Hell, he would even buy her fifty bunnies as pets if he had to. So she\u2019d watched the bushes while he\u2019d watched her, completely startstruck where these strong feelings came from. Well, he\u2019d always known that he liked her very much, and he\u2019s always known that he\u2019d always care for her. But love? He\u2019d never been in love before, at least not like this, but he\u2019d always imagined falling in love to be a process rather than a major discovery like this.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember if the bunny had actually showed up again or not, all he could remember was his <i>love </i>sitting there with this adorable smile.</p><p>And ever since then, he wanted to tell her, but he didn\u2019t. He always backed out last second before saying these three words that meant so much to him. A tiny little part of his worried that she might not feel the same, that she wouldn\u2019t call it <i>love</i>, but a much bigger part wanted it to be the perfect moment. So he\u2019s been thinking about it a lot, if he should tell her over a fancy dinner, or when they shared a romantic bath for stress relief, or even in the process of love-making, but then again, he always brushed it off. Sometimes he wondered if he should\u2019ve told her back then, while they were looking for the bunny. Maybe that would\u2019ve been the perfect time.

He knew it with all his heart and even more so with his body. He couldn\u2019t tell when he knew it, but he remembered when he realized it. <br></p><p>It had been a rather cold evening, (Y/N) and him had been walking back to her apartment from a dinner with some friends of hers. They had been holding hands the whole way back, until he had suddenly heard her gasp before she had stopped walking. <br></p><p>\u201cH, look\u201d, she had whispered, crouching down on the ground and pointing into a bush on the other side of the road. <br></p><p>\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d, he had asked, majorly confused, but he still had crouched down beside her on the pavement. He had squinted in the mere direction of where she had pointed, but couldn\u2019t see a reason to be looking there. So he had turned around, looking at his girl instead, and seeing the most adorable smile on her face. Her eyes had glistened from excitement as she had clutched his arm. It was heartwarming, really. <br></p><p>\u201c \u2018t was a bunny\u201d, she said, \u201cit\u2019s been running into the bush, but maybe it\u2019ll come back out if we wait.\u201d Her eyes had never left the bush where the bunny had disappeared into, and her smile hadn\u2019t faltered. <br></p><p>And that\u2019s when he knew. Because he\u2019d stay there for hours, watching a bush where a stupid bunny disappeared into, freezing. All for her, so she wouldn\u2019t stop smiling. Hell, he would even buy her fifty bunnies as pets if he had to. So she\u2019d watched the bushes while he\u2019d watched her, completely startstruck where these strong feelings came from. Well, he\u2019d always known that he liked her very much, and he\u2019s always known that he\u2019d always care for her. But love? He\u2019d never been in love before, at least not like this, but he\u2019d always imagined falling in love to be a process rather than a major discovery like this.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember if the bunny had actually showed up again or not, all he could remember was his <i>love </i>sitting there with this adorable smile.</p><p>And ever since then, he wanted to tell her, but he didn\u2019t. He always backed out last second before saying these three words that meant so much to him. A tiny little part of his worried that she might not feel the same, that she wouldn\u2019t call it <i>love</i>, but a much bigger part wanted it to be the perfect moment. So he\u2019s been thinking about it a lot, if he should tell her over a fancy dinner, or when they shared a romantic bath for stress relief, or even in the process of love-making, but then again, he always brushed it off. Sometimes he wondered if he should\u2019ve told her back then, while they were looking for the bunny. Maybe that would\u2019ve been the perfect time. But these feelings had been so overwhelming for him, so new, that he just couldn\u2019t get it out. <br></p><p>However, the longer he kept his mouth shut about his feelings, the more impatient he got.

With every passing opportunity, the desire to just tell her, to tell everyone they knew that <i>he loved her</i>, just got bigger and bigger. Until one day, he couldn&rsquo;t bear it anymore. <br /></p><p>It was literally the worst moment he could&rsquo;ve imagined, but he had to tell her. He couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet for even a second longer. <br /></p><p>They were sitting on the sofa in her living room, watching a show that she really liked and he&rsquo;d watch it because she liked it so much. She was cuddled against him while he slowly drew circles on her back with a few of his fingers. Suddenly, he stopped his movements, making (Y/N) look up at him in wonder. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you stop? Felt nice&rdquo;, she said. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, he blurted out, completely out of context, which he realized only after these three little words had made their way, <i>finally</i>, to be heard. He sucked in a deep breath, now feeling more unsure that she&rsquo;d love him back than ever. But now it was a little to late to overthink it, again, as these words were now in the open. <br /></p><p>(Y/N) looked at him amazed. His heart dropped, and if he didn&rsquo;t know any better, he&rsquo;d say that it stopped momentarily.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too&rdquo;, she said,<i> finally</i>, and he felt like his heart started beating again, now faster than ever, almost overflowing with joy. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;, he asked almost breathlessly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I thought you knew tha&rsquo;, Harry.&rdquo; She looked at him now with his favourite smile of hers. And yes, he knew. He had always known, infact. But he had to admit that his worry got the better of him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but we.. never said it, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Now (Y/N) sat up next to him, so they could face each other properly. She took his hand in hers as she said: &ldquo;Yes we did. Just not in these words.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked at her confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, c&rsquo;mon. We say it all the time, really. And we show it to each other. Like, yesterday you told me I was your favourite person to snuggle with. And you always text me when I&rsquo;m driving to my parents if I got there safely. And don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t notice how you hug me a little tighter when we won&rsquo;t be seeing each other for a week or two and tell me how much you&rsquo;ll miss me.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry had never looked at it that way. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me&rdquo;, she said as he didn&rsquo;t respond.</p><p>But yes, it made sense to him now. They had said it all the time, and even more, made sure that the other did feel loved. All these little things that he did subsconsciously for her came to his mind again. Buying her favourite brand of peanut butter although he didn&rsquo;t like it as much, taking one more sweater with him because he knew she&rsquo;d be cold, putting a towel in the tumbledryer for her when she&rsquo;d get out of the bathtub. <br /></p><p>And she&rsquo;d done the same for him, he realized. She&rsquo;d always stay up until he texted her that he landed safely from a flight, and he&rsquo;d always find some of his favourite smoothies in her fridge although she didn&rsquo;t even like them. <br /></p><p>God, they were so whipped for each other that it was almost ridiculous. The thought of that made him smile brighter than he thought he ever had. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Guess tha&rsquo;s true, love&rdquo;, he said and gave her a delicate peck on the lips, feeling incredibly happy that he finally, <i>finally</i>, got to tell her. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re warm&rdquo; he said contently as he pulled her into his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;There, you said it again&rdquo;, she said.</p><hr /><p><b>View all of my posts <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\"><i>here </i></a>or request something <i><a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></i>!<br /></b></p>",

He knows all of her concerns, showers her with love and kisses and whenever she feels self-conscious he always tells Y/N she\u2019s the most beautiful girl he had ever laid his eyes on and she had a special place in his heart.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think about losing weight before, because she wants her life to be happy. And she certainly didn\u2019t want her life to be controlled by some random people\u2019s words.</p><p>Not until when her picture with Harry has flooded with comments of her being big.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should lose some weight.\u201d Y/N told Harry, sitting on the sofa while scrolling through the comments on Instagram.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat? Gorgeous, you\u2019re already beautiful the way you are.\u201d Harry leans over and took away her phone, laying his head over her lap.\u00a0\u201cThe fuck is this? These people really need to mind their own fucking business.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I think they\u2019re telling the truth&hellip;\u201dY/N said, stroking his hair.\u00a0\u201cI am not like your ex-girlfriends, and not like the other girls. They\u2019re beautiful when they smile, they can wear cute clothes and bathing suits, having mirror selfies&hellip; I can\u2019t even look at my own reflections.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d Harry sits up and kisses her lips.\u00a0\u201cI love you. I don\u2019t want you to be my ex-girlfriends or the other girls. They\u2019re called\u00a0\u2018exes\u2019 for a reason, right? And my reason is you. You are the one I want, Y/N. \u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He then kisses on her cheeks.\u00a0\u201cYou are adorable, sweet, charming. Most importantly, you\u2019re beautiful as fuck.\u201d\u00a0 And another kiss on her forehead, making her giggle.\u00a0\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I hate to interrupt, but don\u2019t you have some meetings today? In like&hellip;\u201d She looked at her watch.\u00a0\u201c20 minutes?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh shit, I almost forgot.\u201d Harry jumped up from the sofa, went upstairs to change into his suit.\u00a0\u201cPrincess, I can cancel the meeting if you want me to stay. I don\u2019t want to leave you here alone, especially when you\u2019re in a mood like this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, babe. I\u2019m just messin\u2019 with ya.\u201d Y/N gave him a wink.\u00a0\u201cPlus, I\u2019m meeting a close friend today.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNaughty, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Harry planted a kiss on her forehead and lips.\u00a0\u201cSee you tonight, gorgeous.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d She gave him a big smile, when she\u2019s sure he left, she closed the door and went upstairs to their room and look at the mirror.</p><p><i>I\u2019m not that pretty.\u00a0</i></p><p>The alarm that Y/N set rang, telling her to get ready.</p><p>\u201cRight, I have stuff to do.\u201d She ignored her negative thoughts, got dressed and headed out to the cafe that she and her friend had set to meet.<br/></p><p>When Y/N reached the cafe, her friend, Lily was already there, along with a guy that she assumes is Lily\u2019s boyfriend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N! Long time no see!\u201d Lily gave Y/N a hug and sat her down.\u00a0\u201cThis is my boyfriend, Arthur.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Arthur. I thought it was just two of us today, Lily.\u201d Y/N smiled at Arthur.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted you to meet him! Plus, he drove me here.\u201d Lily said, sipping her iced latte.\u00a0\u201cDo you want anything to drink? I can get Arthur to order for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay&hellip;um&hellip; I\u2019ll just have an iced mocha, thank you.\u201d Y/N said while looking for her purse inside her bag.<br/></p><p>\u201cMocha? You\u2019re having that?\u201d Lily asked, looking at her. \u201cI heard that it\u2019s not good for you&hellip; you know if you\u2019re on a diet. Oh, babe, can I have some waffles please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N felt embarrassed, she gave them an awkward smile.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just have a cup of hot water.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Arthur nodded and headed to order.</p><p>Y/N and Lily started catching up like old friends do, and Arthur was sitting there on his phone while having a couple bites of Lily\u2019s waffle.</p><p>\u201cI went to the park the other day with my friend and when we were talking and suddenly this one girl that I didn\u2019t know, came up and pushed me away while I am talking to my friend. She just appeared out of nowhere and wrapped her hand around his arm.\u201d Y/N was thinking about that incident that happened the other day, and suddenly Arthur chipped in and asked:\u00a0\u201cDid she even had the strength to do that? I mean, you\u2019re bigger than her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking!\u201d Lily laughed and looked at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cYeah, haha. Well, she caught me off-guard so of course, I got pushed away.\u201d She explains.</p><p>\u201cOh, before I forgot, I brought this for you.\u201d Lily took something out of her purse. It\u2019s a bottle of pills.\u00a0\u201cWeight loss pills. I got it for a special price, brought it just for you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N faked her smile and took the bottle.</p><p>A few hours later after Y/N and Lily are done catching up, She stood up and said goodbye to Lily. She heard them laughing when she\u2019s about to leave. It\u2019s like secondary school all over again. Y/N hates how Lily and Arthur treated her, even if they\u2019re just kidding.</p><p>Y/N sat in her car at the parking lot while waiting for her car to warm up, she got a call from Harry.</p><p>\u201cHey beautiful, what do you want for dinner? I\u2019m on my way home. Pizza okay?\u201d<br/></p><p>Her tears fell as soon as she heard his voice.</p><p>\u201cNah&hellip; I don\u2019t feel like eating pizza. How about salads?\u201d She tried to sound as happy as she could. But she couldn\u2019t fool Harry. \u201cOh no babe, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m fine&hellip;nothing happened.\u201d She wiped off her tears with her thumb.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna drive now, talk to you when I get back?\u201d<br/>\u201cOkay, come home quick, love. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss you too, dimples.\u201d She smiled at the thought of going home to him.</p><p>When Y/N reaches home, she saw her beloved boyfriend lying down on the sofa scrolling through his phone, and she immediately felt that there\u2019s much more stuff for her to care about.\u00a0\u201cHey honey, I\u2019m home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry chuckled and got up from the sofa, heading towards her and giving her a hug.\u00a0\u201cHow\u2019s your day, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm&hellip;fine, I guess.\u201d She buried her head into his chest.\u00a0\u201cI miss you so much.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your friend?\u201d Harry asked, stroking Y/N\u2019s hair.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s a bitch.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s not talk about her. So, salad for dinner? Really?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me just now. I want pizza.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Harry gave her a kiss.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t ever change. I love you just the way you are.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N was self-conscious with her body, but now she doesn\u2019t give a fuck.</p><p>She has Harry now, and he made her life better.</p><hr><ul><li>I have an alternative version, let me know if you guys wanna read it x</li></ul><hr><p><b><a href=\"https://thedevilinbetweenthesheets.tumblr.com/post/183814285848/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a>\u00a0</b></p>",

I\u2019m just messin\u2019 with ya.\u201d Y/N gave him a wink.\u00a0\u201cPlus, I\u2019m meeting a close friend today.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNaughty, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Harry planted a kiss on her forehead and lips.\u00a0\u201cSee you tonight, gorgeous.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d She gave him a big smile, when she\u2019s sure he left, she closed the door and went upstairs to their room and look at the mirror.</p><p><i>I\u2019m not that pretty.\u00a0</i></p><p>The alarm that Y/N set rang, telling her to get ready.</p><p>\u201cRight, I have stuff to do.\u201d She ignored her negative thoughts, got dressed and headed out to the cafe that she and her friend had set to meet.<br></p><p>When Y/N reached the cafe, her friend, Lily was already there, along with a guy that she assumes is Lily\u2019s boyfriend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N! Long time no see!\u201d Lily gave Y/N a hug and sat her down.\u00a0\u201cThis is my boyfriend, Arthur.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Arthur. I thought it was just two of us today, Lily.\u201d Y/N smiled at Arthur.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted you to meet him! Plus, he drove me here.\u201d Lily said, sipping her iced latte.\u00a0\u201cDo you want anything to drink? I can get Arthur to order for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay\u2026um\u2026 I\u2019ll just have an iced mocha, thank you.\u201d Y/N said while looking for her purse inside her bag.<br></p><p>\u201cMocha? You\u2019re having that?\u201d Lily asked, looking at her. \u201cI heard that it\u2019s not good for you\u2026 you know if you\u2019re on a diet. Oh, babe, can I have some waffles please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N felt embarrassed, she gave them an awkward smile.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just have a cup of hot water.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Arthur nodded and headed to order.</p><p>Y/N and Lily started catching up like old friends do, and Arthur was sitting there on his phone while having a couple bites of Lily\u2019s waffle.</p><p>\u201cI went to the park the other day with my friend and when we were talking and suddenly this one girl that I didn\u2019t know, came up and pushed me away while I am talking to my friend. She just appeared out of nowhere and wrapped her hand around his arm.\u201d Y/N was thinking about that incident that happened the other day, and suddenly Arthur chipped in and asked:\u00a0\u201cDid she even had the strength to do that? I mean, you\u2019re bigger than her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking!\u201d Lily laughed and looked at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cYeah, haha. Well, she caught me off-guard so of course, I got pushed away.\u201d She explains.</p><p>\u201cOh, before I forgot, I brought this for you.\u201d Lily took something out of her purse. It\u2019s a bottle of pills.\u00a0\u201cWeight loss pills. I got it for a special price, brought it just for you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N faked her smile and took the bottle.</p><p>A few hours later after Y/N and Lily are done catching up, She stood up and said goodbye to Lily. She heard them laughing when she\u2019s about to leave. It\u2019s like secondary school all over again. Y/N hates how Lily and Arthur treated her, even if they\u2019re just kidding.</p><p>Y/N sat in her car at the parking lot while waiting for her car to warm up, she got a call from Harry.</p><p>\u201cHey beautiful, what do you want for dinner? I\u2019m on my way home. Pizza okay?\u201d<br></p><p>Her tears fell as soon as she heard his voice.</p><p>\u201cNah\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like eating pizza. How about salads?\u201d She tried to sound as happy as she could. But she couldn\u2019t fool Harry. \u201cOh no babe, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m fine\u2026nothing happened.\u201d She wiped off her tears with her thumb.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna drive now, talk to you when I get back?\u201d<br>\u201cOkay, come home quick, love. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss you too, dimples.\u201d She smiled at the thought of going home to him.</p><p>When Y/N reaches home, she saw her beloved boyfriend lying down on the sofa scrolling through his phone, and she immediately felt that there\u2019s much more stuff for her to care about.\u00a0\u201cHey honey, I\u2019m home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry chuckled and got up from the sofa, heading towards her and giving her a hug.\u00a0\u201cHow\u2019s your day, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm\u2026fine, I guess.\u201d She buried her head into his chest.\u00a0\u201cI miss you so much.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your friend?\u201d Harry asked, stroking Y/N\u2019s hair.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s a bitch.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s not talk about her. So, salad for dinner? Really?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me just now. I want pizza.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Harry gave her a kiss.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t ever change. I love you just the way you are.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N was self-conscious with her body, but now she doesn\u2019t give a fuck.</p><p>She has Harry now, and he made her life better.</p><hr><ul><li>I have an alternative version, let me know if you guys wanna read it x</li></ul><hr><p><b><a href=\"https://thedevilinbetweenthesheets.tumblr.com/post/183814285848/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a>\u00a0</b></p>",

She doesn\u2019t even look at her reflections.</p><p>It all started when Y/N was in secondary school.

You\u2019re blocking my way! \u201d\u00a0</p><p>Well, it hurts Y/N\u2019s heart, of course. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong, she\u2019s just passing by and minding her own business.</p><p>Sometimes when she\u2019s eating, they\u2019ll say stuff like:\u00a0\u201cStop eating so much, you\u2019re already so fat.\u201d and\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re eating that for lunch?

He knows all of her concerns, showers her with love and kisses and whenever she feels self-conscious he always tells Y/N she\u2019s the most beautiful girl he had ever laid his eyes on and she had a special place in his heart.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think about losing weight before, because she wants her life to be happy. And she certainly didn\u2019t want her life to be controlled by some random people\u2019s words.</p><p>Not until when her picture with Harry has flooded with comments of her being big.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should lose some weight.\u201d Y/N told Harry, sitting on the sofa while scrolling through the comments on Instagram.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?

They\u2019re beautiful when they smile, they can wear cute clothes and bathing suits, having mirror selfies\u2026 I can\u2019t even look at my own reflections.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d Harry sits up and kisses her lips.\u00a0\u201cI love you.

You are the one I want, Y/N. \u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He then kisses on her cheeks.\u00a0\u201cYou are adorable, sweet, charming. Most importantly, you\u2019re beautiful as fuck.\u201d\u00a0 And another kiss on her forehead, making her giggle.\u00a0\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I hate to interrupt, but don\u2019t you have some meetings today?

You are the one I want, Y/N. &rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He then kisses on her cheeks.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are adorable, sweet, charming. Most importantly, you&rsquo;re beautiful as fuck.&rdquo;&nbsp; And another kiss on her forehead, making her giggle.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As much as I hate to interrupt, but don&rsquo;t you have some meetings today? In like&hellip;&rdquo; She looked at her watch.&nbsp;&ldquo;20 minutes?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit, I almost forgot.&rdquo; Harry jumped up from the sofa, went upstairs to change into his suit.&nbsp;&ldquo;Princess, I can cancel the meeting if you want me to stay. I don&rsquo;t want to leave you here alone, especially when you&rsquo;re in a mood like this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, babe. I&rsquo;m just messin&rsquo; with ya.&rdquo; Y/N gave him a wink.&nbsp;&ldquo;Plus, I&rsquo;m meeting a close friend today.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Naughty, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Harry planted a kiss on her forehead and lips.&nbsp;&ldquo;See you tonight, gorgeous.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bye!&rdquo; She gave him a big smile, when she&rsquo;s sure he left, she closed the door and went upstairs to their room and look at the mirror.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m not that pretty.&nbsp;</i></p><p>The alarm that Y/N set rang, telling her to get ready.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, I have stuff to do.&rdquo; She ignored her negative thoughts, got dressed and headed out to the cafe that she and her friend had set to meet.<br /></p><p>When Y/N reached the cafe, her friend, Lily was already there, along with a guy that she assumes is Lily&rsquo;s boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Y/N! Long time no see!&rdquo; Lily gave Y/N a hug and sat her down.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is my boyfriend, Arthur.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, Arthur. I thought it was just two of us today, Lily.&rdquo; Y/N smiled at Arthur.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, I wanted you to meet him! Plus, he drove me here.&rdquo; Lily said, sipping her iced latte.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want anything to drink? I can get Arthur to order for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay&hellip;um&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just have an iced mocha, thank you.&rdquo; Y/N said while looking for her purse inside her bag.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mocha? You&rsquo;re having that?&rdquo; Lily asked, looking at her. &ldquo;I heard that it&rsquo;s not good for you&hellip; you know if you&rsquo;re on a diet. Oh, babe, can I have some waffles please?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N felt embarrassed, she gave them an awkward smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ll just have a cup of hot water.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Arthur nodded and headed to order.</p><p>Y/N and Lily started catching up like old friends do, and Arthur was sitting there on his phone while having a couple bites of Lily&rsquo;s waffle.</p><p>&ldquo;I went to the park the other day with my friend and when we were talking and suddenly this one girl that I didn&rsquo;t know, came up and pushed me away while I am talking to my friend. She just appeared out of nowhere and wrapped her hand around his arm.&rdquo; Y/N was thinking about that incident that happened the other day, and suddenly Arthur chipped in and asked:&nbsp;&ldquo;Did she even had the strength to do that? I mean, you&rsquo;re bigger than her, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking!&rdquo; Lily laughed and looked at Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, haha. Well, she caught me off-guard so of course, I got pushed away.&rdquo; She explains.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, before I forgot, I brought this for you.&rdquo; Lily took something out of her purse. It&rsquo;s a bottle of pills.&nbsp;&ldquo;Weight loss pills. I got it for a special price, brought it just for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N faked her smile and took the bottle.</p><p>A few hours later after Y/N and Lily are done catching up, She stood up and said goodbye to Lily. She heard them laughing when she&rsquo;s about to leave. It&rsquo;s like secondary school all over again. Y/N hates how Lily and Arthur treated her, even if they&rsquo;re just kidding.</p><p>Y/N sat in her car at the parking lot while waiting for her car to warm up, she got a call from Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey beautiful, what do you want for dinner? I&rsquo;m on my way home. Pizza okay?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Her tears fell as soon as she heard his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Nah&hellip; I don&rsquo;t feel like eating pizza. How about salads?&rdquo; She tried to sound as happy as she could. But she couldn&rsquo;t fool Harry. &ldquo;Oh no babe, what happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m fine&hellip;nothing happened.&rdquo; She wiped off her tears with her thumb.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna drive now, talk to you when I get back?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Okay, come home quick, love. I miss you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss you too, dimples.&rdquo; She smiled at the thought of going home to him.</p><p>When Y/N reaches home, she saw her beloved boyfriend lying down on the sofa scrolling through his phone, and she immediately felt that there&rsquo;s much more stuff for her to care about.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey honey, I&rsquo;m home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Harry chuckled and got up from the sofa, heading towards her and giving her a hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your day, baby girl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;fine, I guess.&rdquo; She buried her head into his chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;I miss you so much.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo; Harry asked, stroking Y/N&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bitch.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, then let&rsquo;s not talk about her. So, salad for dinner? Really?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not. I didn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gotten into me just now. I want pizza.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my girl.&rdquo; Harry gave her a kiss.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever change. I love you just the way you are.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N was self-conscious with her body, but now she doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p><p>She has Harry now, and he made her life better.</p><hr /><ul><li>I have an alternative version, let me know if you guys wanna read it x</li></ul><hr /><p><b><a href=\"https://thedevilinbetweenthesheets.tumblr.com/post/183814285848/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a>&nbsp;</b></p>",
