If I&rsquo;m healthy that is&hellip;</p> <p>And that&rsquo;s my problem. I can&rsquo;t stay healthy for more than a month or two at a time. I work in a school environment and am constantly exposed to children, so I do extra things to make sure I remain healthy (wash my hands plenty, make sure to rest, take daily vitamins, etc&hellip;) but it seems it&rsquo;s never enough.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m writing this in my hospital bed as I&rsquo;ve got pneumonia in my right lung and I&rsquo;m fed up with being sick all the damn time.</p> <p>Do I need to be on a 3 day routine?
