        "body": "<h1><b>Game of Thrones: Why Sansa could win it all</b></h1><p>By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, JOSH BOAK and PAUL WISEMAN.</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Where most \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans were horrified by the beheading of the beloved Ned Stark and blamed it on a ruthless king, Columbia University business professor Bruce Craven saw a lesson in failed leadership.</p><p>The northerner Stark was simply too proud to adjust to the cutthroat nature of King\u2019s Landing as it became mired in a scramble over royal succession. His execution set into motion battles, intrigues, romances and resurrections that will culminate this Sunday with the show\u2019s highly-anticipated final season.</p><p>In the AP\u2019s weekly \u201cWealth of Westeros\u201d series, we\u2019ll be delving into the latest plot twists and analyzing the economic and business forces driving the story. We examine the show\u2019s central question in Part 1: Who will win the Iron Throne?</p><p>The judgment of Craven and other academic minds may surprise you: Sansa Stark, Ned\u2019s eldest daughter.</p><p>Sansa has grown from a once-helpless princess with dreams of lemon cakes into a wily strategist. She has endured marriages that were degrading and abusive, finding ways to adapt and survive that her late father could never manage.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had probably the closest involvement with the widest array of different leaders,\u201d said Craven, who has written a new business book, \u201dWin or Die: Leadership Secrets from Game of Thrones\u00a0.\u201d</p><p>Sansa has learned from Littlefinger\u2019s manipulations. She\u2019s seen the pitfalls from what Craven calls Cersei\u2019s \u201ctransactional\u201d approach to leadership. And she\u2019s seen her kinsman Jon Snow\u2019s idealism transform him from a brooding teenager into a military commander capable of challenging the zombie army of the Night King.</p><p>This education might be the ultimate advantage, even if she lacks the firepower of Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s dragons or the Valyrian steel sword wielded by Jon Snow.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have dragons. She didn\u2019t learn to become an assassin,\u201d added Craven, who admits his prediction is just a hunch. \u201cEverything she\u2019s gone through, part of me wants to see her leverage that in some unpredictable way.\u201d</p><p>Sansa does enjoy a major edge in terms of resources, said Mark Wright, research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. From the U.S. Civil War to World War II, victorious armies have often gained a decisive edge by having the best equipment, stable supply lines and multitudes of soldiers. Her perceived rivals for the throne are running close to empty militarily and economically.</p><p>Thanks to her feeble cousin Robin Arryn, the Knights of the Vale are under her command. Her troops are the freshest and arguably best provisioned, given the Vale\u2019s rich soil that provides for wheat, corn, barley and enviously large pumpkins.</p><p>Her rivals have suffered the destruction of their farmland and the depletion of their armies after years of warfare and the occasional scorched-earth dragon attack.</p><p>\u201cI think it was Napoleon who said an army marches on its stomach,\u201d Wright said.</p><p>Not everyone, however, is convinced that Sansa will rule.</p><p>The betting markets have picked Bran Stark, her mystical and disabled brother.</p><p>He might also seem like an unexpected pick. Bran has the ability to journey through time. This gives him an oracular power, but it has extinguished his former emotional warmth for cold prophecies. He seems too detached from humanity to sit on the Iron Throne or establish the personal connections that a ruler would need to rally a weary populace.</p><p>But to economists, his popularity on the betting markets matters a lot.</p><p>The market is the closest thing the public has to a three-eyed raven. It can forecast the future by distilling the wisdom of the crowds. The stock and bond markets do this daily.</p><p>He has no charisma and can\u2019t fight, and the show suggested last season that he\u2019s no longer even a Stark. But Boyle Sports gives him 4/5 odds. He\u2019s the top pick on Bovada, too. And on Oddschecker. And Gambling.com.</p><p>But of course, markets can be wrong.

Plus, she has dragons.</p><p>She is &ldquo;the queen we chose,&rdquo; in the words of her interpreter and adviser, Missandei.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a surprisingly positive lesson from a show that has relentlessly crushed so many beloved characters.</p><p>&ldquo;All the leadership that goes forward successfully against the odds &mdash; with the exception of Cersei &mdash; involves leaders that are motivated by helping other people,&rdquo; Craven says. &ldquo;Their leadership isn&rsquo;t strictly about their own achievement or standing at the top of the org chart.&rdquo;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s hope that leadership style works against the army of the Night King.</p><p>Note here</p><p data-npf=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2F23087f28dfe94d0992fb3fdaf57c4453&amp;t=YTM4YmRjM2VjOWFiNGJhMGM1NDBjOWYzMGY0NDVjYjY2M2E3ZDRhNCxlYzYwZmM2NjU3OTc1ZmIzOTAwOGQ3OTIxYjllZjMxYmYyYWNkZDVi&quot;,&quot;display_url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/23087f28dfe94d0992fb3fdaf57c4453&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Game of Thrones: Why Sansa could win it all&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;WASHINGTON (AP) &mdash; Where most \\&quot;Game of Thrones\\&quot; fans were horrified by the beheading of the beloved Ned Stark and blamed it on a ruthless k&quot;,&quot;site_name&quot;:&quot;AP NEWS&quot;,&quot;poster&quot;:[{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7f1826897985dff8771d0baf3e96791/tumblr_pppusaoklQ1rc8m9r_540.jpg&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:3000,&quot;height&quot;:1996}]}\" class=\"npf_link\"><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2F23087f28dfe94d0992fb3fdaf57c4453&amp;t=YTM4YmRjM2VjOWFiNGJhMGM1NDBjOWYzMGY0NDVjYjY2M2E3ZDRhNCxlYzYwZmM2NjU3OTc1ZmIzOTAwOGQ3OTIxYjllZjMxYmYyYWNkZDVi\" target=\"_blank\">Game of Thrones: Why Sansa could win it all</a></p></p>",

Since you are Anon I couldn&rsquo;t reply privately, and you had some major spoilers in the question, so I just left that part out so I could post it for you to see.</p><p>I actually had to go back to the fic to refresh my memory, but remembered Robb was 26 Sansa 23 when that thing happened, and the time from then to the time&nbsp; of that other thing happening, it is a span of 3 years. Robb was&nbsp;&ldquo;not yet 30&Prime; (Sansa&rsquo;s thoughts when she looked at his grey streaks in his hair).&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you so much for the lovely compliment. I loved writing Don&rsquo;t Stop Swaying. It&rsquo;s the only fic so far I was so passionate about that I would stay up to all hours of the morning when I had to work the next day, just to finish a chapter. I admit I&rsquo;m proud of it. I faced a lot of adversity and annoyances and bullying when writing it but I ignored it all and persevered.

He wanted to enjoy the deserted beach for a little while longer. He wanted to breath in the fresh air without the smell of blood staining it. He wanted to enjoy the song the sea was singing without screaming and chattering ruining it.</p><p>But just when he was about to close his eyes he saw her. She had her bare feet in the ice cold water and she carried her white shoes in her hands. The wind blew her red hair around her face and even though night was already falling the blue of her eyes pierced through the twilight. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d He yelled her name and tightened his grip on the reins while he lead Ghost towards her. He was dangerously close to the water. </p><p>But so was she.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming. You have to get out of here.\u201d He stopped Ghost a few inches from the salted water. The song the sea was singing was deafening now and he knew that the only reason Ghost was still standing here was his unexplainable loyalty to the rider on his back. </p><p>But most water horses weren\u2019t like that. If they would surface now, they would kill Sansa Stark in less than a heartbeat. </p><p>But Sansa didn\u2019t step out of the water. Instead she looked up at him with a smile on her face while she tucked a strand of red hair behind her ear. \u201cI&rsquo;m counting on it.\u201d </p><p>Jon furrowed his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m gonna race this year, Jon.\u201d She straightened her back and lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m gonna catch a horse and I\u2019m gonna race it. And no one can stop me.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a deep breath. \u201cYou&rsquo;re gonna get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk me out of this.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes and he licked his lips while he stared at the dark clouds above their heads. \u201cJust get your feet out of the water and wait here until I\u2019m back.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her answer and turned around to get Ghost away from the sea, away from its luring song, away from the horses who could surface any moment now. \u201cDon&rsquo;t let me down now, buddy.\u201d He jumped down and patted his white stallion on the back. Swiftly he tied the reins around a sturdy tree. </p><p>If Ghost really wanted to break free, the tree wouldn\u2019t be able to hold him back. But if Ghost really wanted to break free, he would have done so years ago already. </p><p>While Jon rushed back to Sansa, this time on his own two feet, he looked over his shoulder a few times to reassure himself that Ghost could do this, that Ghost could fight his instincts, that Ghost would wait for him to come back.</p><p>Just like Sansa. She had stepped out of the water, but she still held the shoes in her hands.</p><p>\u201cPut your shoes back on.\u201d Jon stared at the waves, rising higher and higher. \u201cNow!\u201d He yelled when he saw the first colourful heads in the distance.</p><p>Sansa did what he asked without protesting, even though her feet were still wet and covered in sand. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping you!\u201d Jon screamed and he braced himself for what was about to come. \u201cAnd keeping you alive in the process.\u201d He couldn\u2019t let her die. He didn\u2019t want her to die. But he also knew that if Sansa had her mind set on something it was impossible to talk her out of it. She had that in common with her elder brother. </p><p>It\u2019s been years since he\u2019d done this. Years since he had found Ghost on a night like this.</p><p>\u201cThe first horse that sets a hoof on the sand is gonna be yours.\u201d Jon turned his face to the girl next to him. </p><p>\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s the right one?\u201d Sansa squeezed her eyes and followed Jon\u2019s glance.</p><p>Because Ghost had been the first one. Because Ghost had walked towards him and had never left him again. Because the first horse wanted to be here, wanted to be with whomever was there to welcome them.</p><p>\u201cJust trust me on this.\u201d Jon swallowed. \u201cDid you bring a halter?\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>At least she was somewhat prepared. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the other horses. They\u2019ll run past you and leave you alone. Just focus on the one you\u2019re gonna catch. The first one. If you feel you can\u2019t handle it, just yell and\u2026\u201d Jon couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. </p><p>A light greyish horse, beautiful and elegant, appeared in front of them and stepped on the wet sand. It seemed disorientated, wild and conflicted, as if it wasn\u2019t sure yet if it wanted to stay here or rush back into the sea. But the horse didn\u2019t get a chance to think about it. </p><p>Sansa Stark stepped towards it and with one smooth movement she threw the halter around the monster\u2019s neck. </p><p>The light greyish horse made an awful and deafening noice while it trampled around without caring if the red haired girl would end up under its hoofs or not. </p><p>\u201cEasy!\u201d Sansa spoke, but she kept her hands firmly on the reins and held on tightly. She looked strong and fierce. Stronger and fiercer than she had ever looked before. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna hurt you.\u201d Her voice was soothing and yet Jon feared it wouldn\u2019t be good enough, not for the horse. It was more than good enough for him.</p><p>Other horses rushed past them. Out of the sea, onto the beach, away from the beach, back into the sea.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a hero?\u201d Sansa whispered and Jon cocked his head when the horse calmed down. \u201cDo you want to make me a hero? We can do this. Together. You and I. We can show the entire world that Sansa Stark is not a damsel in distress. We can show the entire world that they should never underestimate a lady.\u201d She stretched out her hand and the horse didn\u2019t try to bite her arm off when she touched its flank. </p><p>Carefully Jon stepped a little closer towards them, but he stood still at a safe distance to make sure he wouldn\u2019t scare the horse. \u201cYou&rsquo;re not a damsel in distress, Sansa Stark.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and he felt the pearls of sweat covering his forehead when their eyes met. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here? To save the poor damsel in distress?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and he felt his cheeks heating up. \u201cI didn\u2019t save you.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI just gave you a few tips and then you saved yourself.\u201d He bent down and the smile on his face brightened. \u201cYou caught a girl, by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot a girl.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cA lady. I\u2019ll name her Lady.\u201d And then she smiled back. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d She tucked a strand of red hair behind her ear. \u201cWould you be willing to give me some more tips and tricks?\u201d</p><p>As if that was even a question. </p><p>\u201cYes, Sansa Stark.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m gonna help you win this thing.\u201d And he was gonna win her heart in the process, but that was something she didn\u2019t need to know yet.W</p>",

He wanted to enjoy the deserted beach for a little while longer. He wanted to breath in the fresh air without the smell of blood staining it. He wanted to enjoy the song the sea was singing without screaming and chattering ruining it.</p><p>But just when he was about to close his eyes he saw her. She had her bare feet in the ice cold water and she carried her white shoes in her hands. The wind blew her red hair around her face and even though night was already falling the blue of her eyes pierced through the twilight. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSansa!\u201d He yelled her name and tightened his grip on the reins while he lead Ghost towards her. He was dangerously close to the water. </p><p>But so was she.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming. You have to get out of here.\u201d He stopped Ghost a few inches from the salted water. The song the sea was singing was deafening now and he knew that the only reason Ghost was still standing here was his unexplainable loyalty to the rider on his back. </p><p>But most water horses weren\u2019t like that. If they would surface now, they would kill Sansa Stark in less than a heartbeat. </p><p>But Sansa didn\u2019t step out of the water. Instead she looked up at him with a smile on her face while she tucked a strand of red hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d </p><p>Jon furrowed his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna race this year, Jon.\u201d She straightened her back and lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m gonna catch a horse and I\u2019m gonna race it. And no one can stop me.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk me out of this.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes and he licked his lips while he stared at the dark clouds above their heads. \u201cJust get your feet out of the water and wait here until I\u2019m back.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her answer and turned around to get Ghost away from the sea, away from its luring song, away from the horses who could surface any moment now. \u201cDon\u2019t let me down now, buddy.\u201d He jumped down and patted his white stallion on the back. Swiftly he tied the reins around a sturdy tree. </p><p>If Ghost really wanted to break free, the tree wouldn\u2019t be able to hold him back. But if Ghost really wanted to break free, he would have done so years ago already. </p><p>While Jon rushed back to Sansa, this time on his own two feet, he looked over his shoulder a few times to reassure himself that Ghost could do this, that Ghost could fight his instincts, that Ghost would wait for him to come back.</p><p>Just like Sansa. She had stepped out of the water, but she still held the shoes in her hands.</p><p>\u201cPut your shoes back on.\u201d Jon stared at the waves, rising higher and higher. \u201cNow!\u201d He yelled when he saw the first colourful heads in the distance.</p><p>Sansa did what he asked without protesting, even though her feet were still wet and covered in sand. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping you!\u201d Jon screamed and he braced himself for what was about to come. \u201cAnd keeping you alive in the process.\u201d He couldn\u2019t let her die. He didn\u2019t want her to die. But he also knew that if Sansa had her mind set on something it was impossible to talk her out of it. She had that in common with her elder brother. </p><p>It\u2019s been years since he\u2019d done this. Years since he had found Ghost on a night like this.</p><p>\u201cThe first horse that sets a hoof on the sand is gonna be yours.\u201d Jon turned his face to the girl next to him. </p><p>\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s the right one?\u201d Sansa squeezed her eyes and followed Jon\u2019s glance.</p><p>Because Ghost had been the first one. Because Ghost had walked towards him and had never left him again. Because the first horse wanted to be here, wanted to be with whomever was there to welcome them.</p><p>\u201cJust trust me on this.\u201d Jon swallowed. \u201cDid you bring a halter?\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>At least she was somewhat prepared. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the other horses. They\u2019ll run past you and leave you alone. Just focus on the one you\u2019re gonna catch. The first one. If you feel you can\u2019t handle it, just yell and\u2026\u201d Jon couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. </p><p>A light greyish horse, beautiful and elegant, appeared in front of them and stepped on the wet sand. It seemed disorientated, wild and conflicted, as if it wasn\u2019t sure yet if it wanted to stay here or rush back into the sea. But the horse didn\u2019t get a chance to think about it. </p><p>Sansa Stark stepped towards it and with one smooth movement she threw the halter around the monster\u2019s neck. </p><p>The light greyish horse made an awful and deafening noice while it trampled around without caring if the red haired girl would end up under its hoofs or not. </p><p>\u201cEasy!\u201d Sansa spoke, but she kept her hands firmly on the reins and held on tightly. She looked strong and fierce. Stronger and fiercer than she had ever looked before. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna hurt you.\u201d Her voice was soothing and yet Jon feared it wouldn\u2019t be good enough, not for the horse. It was more than good enough for him.</p><p>Other horses rushed past them. Out of the sea, onto the beach, away from the beach, back into the sea.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be a hero?\u201d Sansa whispered and Jon cocked his head when the horse calmed down. \u201cDo you want to make me a hero? We can do this. Together. You and I. We can show the entire world that Sansa Stark is not a damsel in distress. We can show the entire world that they should never underestimate a lady.\u201d She stretched out her hand and the horse didn\u2019t try to bite her arm off when she touched its flank. </p><p>Carefully Jon stepped a little closer towards them, but he stood still at a safe distance to make sure he wouldn\u2019t scare the horse. \u201cYou\u2019re not a damsel in distress, Sansa Stark.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and he felt the pearls of sweat covering his forehead when their eyes met. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here? To save the poor damsel in distress?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and he felt his cheeks heating up. \u201cI didn\u2019t save you.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI just gave you a few tips and then you saved yourself.\u201d He bent down and the smile on his face brightened. \u201cYou caught a girl, by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot a girl.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cA lady. I\u2019ll name her Lady.\u201d And then she smiled back. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d She tucked a strand of red hair behind her ear. \u201cWould you be willing to give me some more tips and tricks?\u201d</p><p>As if that was even a question. </p><p>\u201cYes, Sansa Stark.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m gonna help you win this thing.\u201d And he was gonna win her heart in the process, but that was something she didn\u2019t need to know yet.W</p>",
