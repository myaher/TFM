        "body": "<p>This was originally going to be a write-up I wanted to submit to <a>@critrolestats</a>\u200b, but seeing as they already have an article ready to go, I might as well share it here. And yes, this is pretty similar to what I had blogged before, but&hellip; oh well.</p><p>Here\u2019s a more detailed description of what to expect.</p><p>\n\nAlso, this is all assuming that they remain in their base classes instead of multiclassing. That being said, I\u2019ll also go over the possible class paths they could take at level 7, should they pursue them, based on their ability scores and overall characterization.<br/></p><p>Also, beware. This is going to be a LONG POST as most of this I actually added in to supplement my initial write-up.</p><p>That being said&hellip; let\u2019s take a look! (Spoilers Under the Cut)</p><!-- more --><p>With the expedition into the harsh jungles of Urukaxl now\nwrapped up, and the \u201creward\u201d of Uk\u2019otoa in the inner depths of the temple now claimed\nby Captain Avantika, the Mighty Nein take the opportunity to rest and recover\naboard the Squall Eater en route to Darktow, elevating to level 7 in the process!\nJust like with their previous level advancement, this one provides the Nein\nwith several new boons at their disposal.<br/></p><p><b>The Sentinel Babes: Beauregard and Yasha</b></p><p><b>Base Classes</b></p><p>The Sentinel Babes do one thing very well, and that is kicking ass and taking names&hellip; with a preferred focus on the former, since words quickly become moot once they start thrashing. But the differences in how they approach combat and their class features at level 7 couldn\u2019t be more apparent.</p><p><b>Beau</b></p><p>Aside from gaining a new ki point maximum of 7, Beau gains access to a familiar defensive ability in the form of Evasion.\nMuch like with Vax\u2019ildan in Campaign 1, Evasion will allow Beau to avoid damage\nagainst area-of-effect attacks that require a Dexterity save (something which\nmonks are already very good at), taking only half damage on a failed save and\nNO damage on a success.</p><p>Beau also gains access to Stillness of Mind. If she is under\nan effect where she is charmed or frightened, she can use her action to end the\neffect, which can be quite beneficial in the right circumstances.</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>Considering her keen mind (her actual inquisitive intellect, not the feat; that\u2019s Caleb\u2019s) and ability to adapt to situations with the tools she has, Beau does have the following options aside from taking another level in monk at this juncture:</p><p><b>Fighter (Prerequisites: Strength 13 or Dexterity 13)</b></p><p>While lacking with a Strength of 10, her Dexterity of 18 does qualify for a Fighter dip. Fighters in themselves are quite versatile, especially when taking their subclasses into account. But seeing as this is merely for a 1st-level dip, this is what Beau would gain:</p><ul><li>Hit die: d10. A step up from her usual d8. A slightly higher chance for more HP can make all the difference.</li><li>Proficiency in simple and martial weapons. Sadly, I don\u2019t think that Beau\u2019s Martial Arts feature applies to them unless she was a Kensei monk, which she isn\u2019t.</li><li>Proficiency in light armor, medium armor, and shields. Not that monks need them; they benefit the most without it. Besides, Beau\u2019s got kickass bracers as well, so who needs armor?</li><li>Fighting Style: Much like past Fighters in both campaigns with known styles such as Percy (Archery, +2 to ranged attack rolls), Shale (Dueling, +2 damage with one-handed weapons), and Keg (Two-Weapon Fighting, off-hand attacks get added damage from their ability modifier), Beau\u2019s style as a level 1 Fighter would most likely be Great Weapon Fighting, where a 1 or 2 on the damage die of a two-handed/versatile weapon (like her staff) can be rerolled, but the new roll must be used, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.<br/></li><ul><li>Alternatively, if she were to start using shortswords or daggers, another option is Two-Weapon Fighting, especially since daggers are monk weapons and thus the damage die can change due to the Martial Arts feature. Daggers also benefit from the Archery style as they can be thrown as ranged weapons.</li></ul><li>Second Wind: Again, like past Fighters, Beau could use a bonus action to heal hit points equal to 1d10 + her Fighter level (in this case, up to 11). And much like her ki points, Second Wind recharges after a short rest. A good way to extend her survivability if the clerics are low on spells and potions are all expended.<br/></li></ul><p><b>Rogue (Prerequisite: Dexterity 13)</b></p><p>In terms of ability scores, Beau\u2019s already got it made with this one. Having a second rogue in the party would help a bit when it comes to stealth and subterfuge. And even for just a 1st-level dip, Beau already would start off with:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d8. Same as what she usually rolls.</li><li>Proficiency in light armor, one skill from the class&rsquo;s skill list, and thieves&rsquo; tools. While the armor and tool proficiencies are a waste (Beau is already has the tool proficiency due to her background), the chance to learn an extra skill is the real draw. For starters, she could put that toward Perception, making sure that her senses are much more aware.</li><li>Expertise: While her Athletics already benefits from this thanks to her Prodigy feat as a variant human, this class feature can bolster two more of her skills and/or tools. Very useful, especially if it\u2019s for Insight, Perception, or Investigation. Three skills, aside from Stealth, that are vital for rogues (or even inquisitive monks like her) to have.</li><li>Thieves\u2019 Cant: The quintessential secret language of rogues. Pretty much the verbal equivalent of \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d. Not sure if Beau technically knows it already, but it\u2019s there as a feature.</li><li>Sneak Attack (1d6): Despite only doing the most damage up close, the benefits of Sneak Attack can still be applied if she\u2019s adjacent to or flanking with another ally (most often than not Yasha). <b><i>However</i></b>, the added damage must come from a finesse weapon like her throwing stars. Sadly, unarmed strikes and staves are not. Besides, \u201cpunches thrown with finesse\u201d ain\u2019t Beau\u2019s thing. That, and while darts/throwing stars are finesse, they are not melee weapons, therefore they don\u2019t benefit from the increasing Martial Arts damage die. That being said, daggers (which are finesse, can be thrown, AND are melee weapons) DO benefit from not just Martial Arts, but also Sneak Attack. Taking that into account, it may be time for Beau to start taking courses in Cobalt Soul Knife Tossing.</li></ul><p><b>Yasha</b></p><p>As for Yasha, not only does she get to heal someone for 7 points with her Healing Hands, but she also gains a vital perk with Feral Instinct. Just like with Grog and other barbarians in Campaign 1, Feral Instinct allows Yasha to roll with advantage on initiative.<br/></p><p>In addition, Feral Instinct makes it so that if she is not incapacitated when surprised at the start of combat, she can act normally on her first turn, provided that she begins with raging beforehand.</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>Pretty much the only thing that would fit Yasha would be Fighter for the same reasons as Beau.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Two Mercys</b><b>\u00a0and a Bookworm: Jester Lavorre, Caduceus Clay, and Caleb Widogast</b></p><p><b>Base Classes</b></p><p>Level 7 is quite often a great boon for casters. The same\nhold true for our motley trio of two clerics and a wizard. Upon reaching this\nlevel, all three of them gain access to 4th-level spells with a single 4th-level\nslot added to their reserves. But the similarities stop there.</p><p><b>Caleb</b></p><p>Caleb, unlike the clerics, only gets the bonus of adding two\nadditional spells to his spellbook for free. But also unlike clerics, 4th-level\nwizard spells are quite versatile and provide more options, whether it is for\noffense, defense, or general utility. Also, Arcane Recovery can now give Caleb\nback up to 4 spell levels (a single 4th-level slot, four 1st-levels, two 2nd-levels,\nand so on).</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>At this point, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any reason for him to dip into any other classes.</p><p><b>The Clerics</b></p><p>Jester and Caduceus\u2019s options for 4th-level spells are more limited,\nbut what they lack in diversity they make up for in potency. In addition, both\nclerics gain access to their next tier of domain spells.</p><p>Jester, being a cleric of the Traveler, gains a couple of additions\nthat will be familiar to fans of Scanlan Shorthalt in Campaign 1: Dimension\nDoor and Polymorph, both of which were used to great effect back then. For\nthose who don\u2019t recall, Dimension Door will allow Jester to magically travel up\nto a maximum distance of 500 feet and even take one additional creature or\nhumanoid along for the ride, provided they are also Medium-sized. Polymorph, on\nthe other hand, is much like the Wild Shape feature that druids like Nila and\nKeyleth had, but not as versatile in that unlike Wild Shape, a polymorphed\ncreature uses all the stats of their new form.</p><p>As for Mr. Clay, his gifts from the Wildmother are a\ncallback to Pike and Keyleth with Death Ward and Blight, respectively. Death\nWard is a very useful spell for those on the brink of being killed. When a\nwarded creature first drops to 0 hit points, they instead drop to 1 and avoid\nfalling unconscious. It also negates instant-death effects that would happen\nwithout dealing damage (such as Divine Word or Power Word Kill). And Blight is\na pretty nasty spell on its own, dealing 8d8 necrotic damage. It\u2019s the most\neffective on magical plants and plant creatures as they must make their\nConstitution save with disadvantage AND be dealt maximum damage (64 at its base\nlevel on a failed save!)<br/></p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>Considering their current characterization, nothing really stands out to warrant a class dip for either Jester or Caduceus. Albeit, in Caduceus\u2019s case, one could argue that he\u2019d dip a bit into druid to deepen his connection with his diety. On the other hand, he\u2019s having a hard time as is and still feels lost.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Captain \u201cFjord\u201d Tusktooth:\u00a0\u201cI cast Regret.\u201d</b></p><p><b>Base Class</b></p><p>While he was unable to claim his patron\u2019s \u201creward\u201d before\nAvantika did, Fjord\u2019s advancement to level 7 does give him other new features\nto compensate. His spell slots (which recover on a short rest) are now upscaled\nto 4th-level, he gets to add a new spell and/or replace an old one, and he\ngains an additional Eldritch Invocation.</p><p>On the topic of invocations, this includes the ones first\navailable at level 7:</p><ul><li>Bewitching Whispers (1/day casting of Compulsion\nwith a spell slot)<br/></li><li>Dreadful Word (1/day casting of Confusion with a\nspell slot)<br/></li><li>Ghostly Gaze (can see through solid objects up\nto 30 feet for 1 minute, recharges on a short rest)<br/></li><li>Relentless Hex (can teleport up to 30 feet to a\nspace near a \u201ccursed\u201d target with a bonus action, requires the Hex spell or similar\n\u201ccurse\u201d abilities, also requires sight)<br/></li><li>Sculptor of Flesh (1/day casting of Polymorph with\na spell slot)<br/></li><li>Trickster\u2019s Escape (1/day Freedom of Movement,\ndoes not expend a spell slot)<br/></li></ul><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>A dip into a Charisma-based casting class would benefit Fjord greatly to signify his slowly growing confidence and capability as a leader for the Nein. Granted, as is, he\u2019s still harboring feelings of doubt in himself and those around him. But assuming that he can become much more confident, the following option would be the most fitting:</p><p><b>Bard (Prerequisite: Charisma 13)</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in the first campaign, bards are literally the wild cards of any adventuring party. Even for a 1st-level dip, Fjord greatly benefits from it with the following:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d8. Just like his warlock class.<br/></li><li>Proficiencies in light armor, any one skill, and any one musical instrument. Just being able to have proficiency in an extra skill is a good enough boon; the instrument is a nice bonus as well, though.<br/></li><li>Bardic Inspiration (d6): With just a few words and a bonus action, Fjord can provide his allies with a d6 that can be used for attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Just like Scanlan in the first campaign. Granted, unless he\u2019s a level 5 bard, he can only regain his four inspiration dice after a long rest.</li><li><b>Spellcasting</b>: Now I know what you\u2019re thinking.\u00a0\u201cAdam, Fjord\u2019s already a spellcaster. What\u2019s the point of including this as a noteworthy feature in a multiclass?\u201d My answer? It IS a noteworthy feature for a very good reason. As per the Player\u2019s Handbook: \u201cIf you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\u201d &hellip;You catching on? Yes, Fjord can use his secondary slots to cast warlock spells provided that they are the same spell level (in this case, a 1st-level bard slot to cast Hex at 1st-level) as well as use his warlock slots to cast spells from the other class but automatically upscaled (for example, the 1st-level bard spell Dissonant Whispers now cast at 3rd-level due to his warlock slots). Hope that makes sense.</li><ul><li>He also gains two bard cantrips and four 1st-level bard spells.</li><li>Also, he can cast bard spells as rituals.</li></ul></ul><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Nott the Brave:\u00a0\u201cMenagerie Coast: 7.8, Too Much Water\u201d</b></p><p><b>Base Class</b></p><p>In terms of just class abilities, our aquaphobic goblin\ntrickster got the best upgrades. First of all, Fury of the Small\u2019s damage increases\nto 7 and her Sneak Attack damage is now 4d6. Secondly, like Beau, she also gains\naccess to Evasion. Finally, her capacity for spellcasting is practically\ndoubled, with an additional 1st-level slot and, upon reaching level 7, the\nability to cast 2nd-level spells with two new spell slots to accommodate it on\ntop of being given the opportunity to learn a new spell and/or replace an old\none.</p><p>Compared to the other casters in the group, Nott\u2019s options\nare limited to enchantment and illusion spells. Fortunately, there are still\nquite a few potent options for her in that pool\u2026 provided she is simply walking\non it and not swimming.</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>With her only high scores being Dexterity and Intelligence, there are indeed two options that not only would be in-character, but also beneficial for different reasons:</p><p><b>Fighter (Prerequisites: Strength 13 or Dexterity 13)</b></p><p>Once again, a dip into Fighter is very beneficial for someone. Except in Nott\u2019s case, the fighting styles that are best for her are either Archery (for her crossbow) or Defense (+1 to AC when wearing armor), a fighting style previously used when Vax\u2019ildan multiclassed into Paladin in the first campaign.</p><p><b>Wizard (Prerequisite: Intelligence 13)</b></p><p>Following even further in Caleb\u2019s footsteps, Nott can choose to improve her arcane abilities, with a 1st-level dip in wizard providing the following:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d6. Just like Caleb. A downgrade from a d8, but is offset by the other features.<br/></li><li><b>Spellcasting</b>: Much like with Fjord, dipping into another casting class would makes things interesting for Nott but for a variety of different reasons.</li><ul><li>Three additional wizard cantrips and six 1st-level wizard spells in her spellbook.</li><li>Her total number of spell slots in relation to a full caster would be determined by her rogue levels divided by 3 (rounded down) and her wizard levels. In this case, the math would equal out to that of a 3rd level caster. She\u2019d still have access to 2nd-level slots, but no 2nd-level spells.</li><li>When choosing spells from her spellbook, she can only prepare a number of spells equal to her Intelligence modifier plus her wizard level (up to 4 spells).\u00a0</li><li>With a wizard dip, Nott gains the ability to cast certain spells as rituals. The casting time is extended by 10 minutes, but she can also avoid expending a slot. Even better, ritual spells don\u2019t have to be prepared in order to be cast AS rituals.</li><li>She now has more spell variety as opposed to normally being limited to enchantment/illusion spells (and Feather Fall).</li><li>She gains the ability to use a proper arcane focus in place of spell components that don\u2019t have to be consumed or require a cost.</li></ul><li>Arcane Recovery: Much like Caleb, she can recover some slots during a short rest once per day, the combined total being up to half of her wizard levels (rounded up). As a 1st-level Wizard, that\u2019s only 1 spell level, but it\u2019s also 1 spell level regained before taking a long rest.</li></ul><p>Phew! That\u2019s all, I hope.</p>",

Fighters in themselves are quite versatile, especially when taking their subclasses into account. But seeing as this is merely for a 1st-level dip, this is what Beau would gain:</p><ul><li>Hit die: d10. A step up from her usual d8. A slightly higher chance for more HP can make all the difference.</li><li>Proficiency in simple and martial weapons. Sadly, I don\u2019t think that Beau\u2019s Martial Arts feature applies to them unless she was a Kensei monk, which she isn\u2019t.</li><li>Proficiency in light armor, medium armor, and shields. Not that monks need them; they benefit the most without it. Besides, Beau\u2019s got kickass bracers as well, so who needs armor?</li><li>Fighting Style: Much like past Fighters in both campaigns with known styles such as Percy (Archery, +2 to ranged attack rolls), Shale (Dueling, +2 damage with one-handed weapons), and Keg (Two-Weapon Fighting, off-hand attacks get added damage from their ability modifier), Beau\u2019s style as a level 1 Fighter would most likely be Great Weapon Fighting, where a 1 or 2 on the damage die of a two-handed/versatile weapon (like her staff) can be rerolled, but the new roll must be used, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.<br></li><ul><li>Alternatively, if she were to start using shortswords or daggers, another option is Two-Weapon Fighting, especially since daggers are monk weapons and thus the damage die can change due to the Martial Arts feature. Daggers also benefit from the Archery style as they can be thrown as ranged weapons.</li></ul><li>Second Wind: Again, like past Fighters, Beau could use a bonus action to heal hit points equal to 1d10 + her Fighter level (in this case, up to 11). And much like her ki points, Second Wind recharges after a short rest. A good way to extend her survivability if the clerics are low on spells and potions are all expended.<br></li></ul><p><b>Rogue (Prerequisite: Dexterity 13)</b></p><p>In terms of ability scores, Beau\u2019s already got it made with this one. Having a second rogue in the party would help a bit when it comes to stealth and subterfuge. And even for just a 1st-level dip, Beau already would start off with:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d8. Same as what she usually rolls.</li><li>Proficiency in light armor, one skill from the class\u2019s skill list, and thieves\u2019 tools. While the armor and tool proficiencies are a waste (Beau is already has the tool proficiency due to her background), the chance to learn an extra skill is the real draw. For starters, she could put that toward Perception, making sure that her senses are much more aware.</li><li>Expertise: While her Athletics already benefits from this thanks to her Prodigy feat as a variant human, this class feature can bolster two more of her skills and/or tools. Very useful, especially if it\u2019s for Insight, Perception, or Investigation. Three skills, aside from Stealth, that are vital for rogues (or even inquisitive monks like her) to have.</li><li>Thieves\u2019 Cant: The quintessential secret language of rogues. Pretty much the verbal equivalent of \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d. Not sure if Beau technically knows it already, but it\u2019s there as a feature.</li><li>Sneak Attack (1d6): Despite only doing the most damage up close, the benefits of Sneak Attack can still be applied if she\u2019s adjacent to or flanking with another ally (most often than not Yasha). <b><i>However</i></b>, the added damage must come from a finesse weapon like her throwing stars. Sadly, unarmed strikes and staves are not. Besides, \u201cpunches thrown with finesse\u201d ain\u2019t Beau\u2019s thing. That, and while darts/throwing stars are finesse, they are not melee weapons, therefore they don\u2019t benefit from the increasing Martial Arts damage die. That being said, daggers (which are finesse, can be thrown, AND are melee weapons) DO benefit from not just Martial Arts, but also Sneak Attack. Taking that into account, it may be time for Beau to start taking courses in Cobalt Soul Knife Tossing.</li></ul><p><b>Yasha</b></p><p>As for Yasha, not only does she get to heal someone for 7 points with her Healing Hands, but she also gains a vital perk with Feral Instinct. Just like with Grog and other barbarians in Campaign 1, Feral Instinct allows Yasha to roll with advantage on initiative.<br></p><p>In addition, Feral Instinct makes it so that if she is not incapacitated when surprised at the start of combat, she can act normally on her first turn, provided that she begins with raging beforehand.</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>Pretty much the only thing that would fit Yasha would be Fighter for the same reasons as Beau.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Two Mercys</b><b>\u00a0and a Bookworm: Jester Lavorre, Caduceus Clay, and Caleb Widogast</b></p><p><b>Base Classes</b></p><p>Level 7 is quite often a great boon for casters. The same\nhold true for our motley trio of two clerics and a wizard. Upon reaching this\nlevel, all three of them gain access to 4th-level spells with a single 4th-level\nslot added to their reserves. But the similarities stop there.</p><p><b>Caleb</b></p><p>Caleb, unlike the clerics, only gets the bonus of adding two\nadditional spells to his spellbook for free. But also unlike clerics, 4th-level\nwizard spells are quite versatile and provide more options, whether it is for\noffense, defense, or general utility. Also, Arcane Recovery can now give Caleb\nback up to 4 spell levels (a single 4th-level slot, four 1st-levels, two 2nd-levels,\nand so on).</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>At this point, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any reason for him to dip into any other classes.</p><p><b>The Clerics</b></p><p>Jester and Caduceus\u2019s options for 4th-level spells are more limited,\nbut what they lack in diversity they make up for in potency. In addition, both\nclerics gain access to their next tier of domain spells.</p><p>Jester, being a cleric of the Traveler, gains a couple of additions\nthat will be familiar to fans of Scanlan Shorthalt in Campaign 1: Dimension\nDoor and Polymorph, both of which were used to great effect back then. For\nthose who don\u2019t recall, Dimension Door will allow Jester to magically travel up\nto a maximum distance of 500 feet and even take one additional creature or\nhumanoid along for the ride, provided they are also Medium-sized. Polymorph, on\nthe other hand, is much like the Wild Shape feature that druids like Nila and\nKeyleth had, but not as versatile in that unlike Wild Shape, a polymorphed\ncreature uses all the stats of their new form.</p><p>As for Mr. Clay, his gifts from the Wildmother are a\ncallback to Pike and Keyleth with Death Ward and Blight, respectively. Death\nWard is a very useful spell for those on the brink of being killed. When a\nwarded creature first drops to 0 hit points, they instead drop to 1 and avoid\nfalling unconscious. It also negates instant-death effects that would happen\nwithout dealing damage (such as Divine Word or Power Word Kill). And Blight is\na pretty nasty spell on its own, dealing 8d8 necrotic damage. It\u2019s the most\neffective on magical plants and plant creatures as they must make their\nConstitution save with disadvantage AND be dealt maximum damage (64 at its base\nlevel on a failed save!)<br></p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>Considering their current characterization, nothing really stands out to warrant a class dip for either Jester or Caduceus. Albeit, in Caduceus\u2019s case, one could argue that he\u2019d dip a bit into druid to deepen his connection with his diety. On the other hand, he\u2019s having a hard time as is and still feels lost.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Captain \u201cFjord\u201d Tusktooth:\u00a0\u201cI cast Regret.\u201d</b></p><p><b>Base Class</b></p><p>While he was unable to claim his patron\u2019s \u201creward\u201d before\nAvantika did, Fjord\u2019s advancement to level 7 does give him other new features\nto compensate. His spell slots (which recover on a short rest) are now upscaled\nto 4th-level, he gets to add a new spell and/or replace an old one, and he\ngains an additional Eldritch Invocation.</p><p>On the topic of invocations, this includes the ones first\navailable at level 7:</p><ul><li>Bewitching Whispers (1/day casting of Compulsion\nwith a spell slot)<br></li><li>Dreadful Word (1/day casting of Confusion with a\nspell slot)<br></li><li>Ghostly Gaze (can see through solid objects up\nto 30 feet for 1 minute, recharges on a short rest)<br></li><li>Relentless Hex (can teleport up to 30 feet to a\nspace near a \u201ccursed\u201d target with a bonus action, requires the Hex spell or similar\n\u201ccurse\u201d abilities, also requires sight)<br></li><li>Sculptor of Flesh (1/day casting of Polymorph with\na spell slot)<br></li><li>Trickster\u2019s Escape (1/day Freedom of Movement,\ndoes not expend a spell slot)<br></li></ul><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>A dip into a Charisma-based casting class would benefit Fjord greatly to signify his slowly growing confidence and capability as a leader for the Nein. Granted, as is, he\u2019s still harboring feelings of doubt in himself and those around him. But assuming that he can become much more confident, the following option would be the most fitting:</p><p><b>Bard (Prerequisite: Charisma 13)</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in the first campaign, bards are literally the wild cards of any adventuring party. Even for a 1st-level dip, Fjord greatly benefits from it with the following:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d8. Just like his warlock class.<br></li><li>Proficiencies in light armor, any one skill, and any one musical instrument. Just being able to have proficiency in an extra skill is a good enough boon; the instrument is a nice bonus as well, though.<br></li><li>Bardic Inspiration (d6): With just a few words and a bonus action, Fjord can provide his allies with a d6 that can be used for attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Just like Scanlan in the first campaign. Granted, unless he\u2019s a level 5 bard, he can only regain his four inspiration dice after a long rest.</li><li><b>Spellcasting</b>: Now I know what you\u2019re thinking.\u00a0\u201cAdam, Fjord\u2019s already a spellcaster. What\u2019s the point of including this as a noteworthy feature in a multiclass?\u201d My answer? It IS a noteworthy feature for a very good reason. As per the Player\u2019s Handbook: \u201cIf you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\u201d \u2026You catching on? Yes, Fjord can use his secondary slots to cast warlock spells provided that they are the same spell level (in this case, a 1st-level bard slot to cast Hex at 1st-level) as well as use his warlock slots to cast spells from the other class but automatically upscaled (for example, the 1st-level bard spell Dissonant Whispers now cast at 3rd-level due to his warlock slots). Hope that makes sense.</li><ul><li>He also gains two bard cantrips and four 1st-level bard spells.</li><li>Also, he can cast bard spells as rituals.</li></ul></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Nott the Brave:\u00a0\u201cMenagerie Coast: 7.8, Too Much Water\u201d</b></p><p><b>Base Class</b></p><p>In terms of just class abilities, our aquaphobic goblin\ntrickster got the best upgrades. First of all, Fury of the Small\u2019s damage increases\nto 7 and her Sneak Attack damage is now 4d6. Secondly, like Beau, she also gains\naccess to Evasion. Finally, her capacity for spellcasting is practically\ndoubled, with an additional 1st-level slot and, upon reaching level 7, the\nability to cast 2nd-level spells with two new spell slots to accommodate it on\ntop of being given the opportunity to learn a new spell and/or replace an old\none.</p><p>Compared to the other casters in the group, Nott\u2019s options\nare limited to enchantment and illusion spells. Fortunately, there are still\nquite a few potent options for her in that pool\u2026 provided she is simply walking\non it and not swimming.</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>With her only high scores being Dexterity and Intelligence, there are indeed two options that not only would be in-character, but also beneficial for different reasons:</p><p><b>Fighter (Prerequisites: Strength 13 or Dexterity 13)</b></p><p>Once again, a dip into Fighter is very beneficial for someone. Except in Nott\u2019s case, the fighting styles that are best for her are either Archery (for her crossbow) or Defense (+1 to AC when wearing armor), a fighting style previously used when Vax\u2019ildan multiclassed into Paladin in the first campaign.</p><p><b>Wizard (Prerequisite: Intelligence 13)</b></p><p>Following even further in Caleb\u2019s footsteps, Nott can choose to improve her arcane abilities, with a 1st-level dip in wizard providing the following:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d6. Just like Caleb. A downgrade from a d8, but is offset by the other features.<br></li><li><b>Spellcasting</b>: Much like with Fjord, dipping into another casting class would makes things interesting for Nott but for a variety of different reasons.</li><ul><li>Three additional wizard cantrips and six 1st-level wizard spells in her spellbook.</li><li>Her total number of spell slots in relation to a full caster would be determined by her rogue levels divided by 3 (rounded down) and her wizard levels. In this case, the math would equal out to that of a 3rd level caster. She\u2019d still have access to 2nd-level slots, but no 2nd-level spells.</li><li>When choosing spells from her spellbook, she can only prepare a number of spells equal to her Intelligence modifier plus her wizard level (up to 4 spells).\u00a0</li><li>With a wizard dip, Nott gains the ability to cast certain spells as rituals. The casting time is extended by 10 minutes, but she can also avoid expending a slot. Even better, ritual spells don\u2019t have to be prepared in order to be cast AS rituals.</li><li>She now has more spell variety as opposed to normally being limited to enchantment/illusion spells (and Feather Fall).</li><li>She gains the ability to use a proper arcane focus in place of spell components that don\u2019t have to be consumed or require a cost.</li></ul><li>Arcane Recovery: Much like Caleb, she can recover some slots during a short rest once per day, the combined total being up to half of her wizard levels (rounded up). As a 1st-level Wizard, that\u2019s only 1 spell level, but it\u2019s also 1 spell level regained before taking a long rest.</li></ul><p>Phew! That\u2019s all, I hope.</p>",

But also unlike clerics, 4th-level\nwizard spells are quite versatile and provide more options, whether it is for\noffense, defense, or general utility. Also, Arcane Recovery can now give Caleb\nback up to 4 spell levels (a single 4th-level slot, four 1st-levels, two 2nd-levels,\nand so on).</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>At this point, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any reason for him to dip into any other classes.</p><p><b>The Clerics</b></p><p>Jester and Caduceus\u2019s options for 4th-level spells are more limited,\nbut what they lack in diversity they make up for in potency. In addition, both\nclerics gain access to their next tier of domain spells.</p><p>Jester, being a cleric of the Traveler, gains a couple of additions\nthat will be familiar to fans of Scanlan Shorthalt in Campaign 1: Dimension\nDoor and Polymorph, both of which were used to great effect back then. For\nthose who don\u2019t recall, Dimension Door will allow Jester to magically travel up\nto a maximum distance of 500 feet and even take one additional creature or\nhumanoid along for the ride, provided they are also Medium-sized. Polymorph, on\nthe other hand, is much like the Wild Shape feature that druids like Nila and\nKeyleth had, but not as versatile in that unlike Wild Shape, a polymorphed\ncreature uses all the stats of their new form.</p><p>As for Mr. Clay, his gifts from the Wildmother are a\ncallback to Pike and Keyleth with Death Ward and Blight, respectively. Death\nWard is a very useful spell for those on the brink of being killed. When a\nwarded creature first drops to 0 hit points, they instead drop to 1 and avoid\nfalling unconscious. It also negates instant-death effects that would happen\nwithout dealing damage (such as Divine Word or Power Word Kill). And Blight is\na pretty nasty spell on its own, dealing 8d8 necrotic damage. It\u2019s the most\neffective on magical plants and plant creatures as they must make their\nConstitution save with disadvantage AND be dealt maximum damage (64 at its base\nlevel on a failed save!)<br></p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>Considering their current characterization, nothing really stands out to warrant a class dip for either Jester or Caduceus. Albeit, in Caduceus\u2019s case, one could argue that he\u2019d dip a bit into druid to deepen his connection with his diety. On the other hand, he\u2019s having a hard time as is and still feels lost.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Captain \u201cFjord\u201d Tusktooth:\u00a0\u201cI cast Regret.\u201d</b></p><p><b>Base Class</b></p><p>While he was unable to claim his patron\u2019s \u201creward\u201d before\nAvantika did, Fjord\u2019s advancement to level 7 does give him other new features\nto compensate. His spell slots (which recover on a short rest) are now upscaled\nto 4th-level, he gets to add a new spell and/or replace an old one, and he\ngains an additional Eldritch Invocation.</p><p>On the topic of invocations, this includes the ones first\navailable at level 7:</p><ul><li>Bewitching Whispers (1/day casting of Compulsion\nwith a spell slot)<br></li><li>Dreadful Word (1/day casting of Confusion with a\nspell slot)<br></li><li>Ghostly Gaze (can see through solid objects up\nto 30 feet for 1 minute, recharges on a short rest)<br></li><li>Relentless Hex (can teleport up to 30 feet to a\nspace near a \u201ccursed\u201d target with a bonus action, requires the Hex spell or similar\n\u201ccurse\u201d abilities, also requires sight)<br></li><li>Sculptor of Flesh (1/day casting of Polymorph with\na spell slot)<br></li><li>Trickster\u2019s Escape (1/day Freedom of Movement,\ndoes not expend a spell slot)<br></li></ul><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>A dip into a Charisma-based casting class would benefit Fjord greatly to signify his slowly growing confidence and capability as a leader for the Nein. Granted, as is, he\u2019s still harboring feelings of doubt in himself and those around him. But assuming that he can become much more confident, the following option would be the most fitting:</p><p><b>Bard (Prerequisite: Charisma 13)</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in the first campaign, bards are literally the wild cards of any adventuring party. Even for a 1st-level dip, Fjord greatly benefits from it with the following:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d8. Just like his warlock class.<br></li><li>Proficiencies in light armor, any one skill, and any one musical instrument. Just being able to have proficiency in an extra skill is a good enough boon; the instrument is a nice bonus as well, though.<br></li><li>Bardic Inspiration (d6): With just a few words and a bonus action, Fjord can provide his allies with a d6 that can be used for attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Just like Scanlan in the first campaign. Granted, unless he\u2019s a level 5 bard, he can only regain his four inspiration dice after a long rest.</li><li><b>Spellcasting</b>: Now I know what you\u2019re thinking.\u00a0\u201cAdam, Fjord\u2019s already a spellcaster. What\u2019s the point of including this as a noteworthy feature in a multiclass?\u201d My answer? It IS a noteworthy feature for a very good reason. As per the Player\u2019s Handbook: \u201cIf you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\u201d \u2026You catching on? Yes, Fjord can use his secondary slots to cast warlock spells provided that they are the same spell level (in this case, a 1st-level bard slot to cast Hex at 1st-level) as well as use his warlock slots to cast spells from the other class but automatically upscaled (for example, the 1st-level bard spell Dissonant Whispers now cast at 3rd-level due to his warlock slots). Hope that makes sense.</li><ul><li>He also gains two bard cantrips and four 1st-level bard spells.</li><li>Also, he can cast bard spells as rituals.</li></ul></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Nott the Brave:\u00a0\u201cMenagerie Coast: 7.8, Too Much Water\u201d</b></p><p><b>Base Class</b></p><p>In terms of just class abilities, our aquaphobic goblin\ntrickster got the best upgrades. First of all, Fury of the Small\u2019s damage increases\nto 7 and her Sneak Attack damage is now 4d6. Secondly, like Beau, she also gains\naccess to Evasion. Finally, her capacity for spellcasting is practically\ndoubled, with an additional 1st-level slot and, upon reaching level 7, the\nability to cast 2nd-level spells with two new spell slots to accommodate it on\ntop of being given the opportunity to learn a new spell and/or replace an old\none.</p><p>Compared to the other casters in the group, Nott\u2019s options\nare limited to enchantment and illusion spells. Fortunately, there are still\nquite a few potent options for her in that pool\u2026 provided she is simply walking\non it and not swimming.</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>With her only high scores being Dexterity and Intelligence, there are indeed two options that not only would be in-character, but also beneficial for different reasons:</p><p><b>Fighter (Prerequisites: Strength 13 or Dexterity 13)</b></p><p>Once again, a dip into Fighter is very beneficial for someone. Except in Nott\u2019s case, the fighting styles that are best for her are either Archery (for her crossbow) or Defense (+1 to AC when wearing armor), a fighting style previously used when Vax\u2019ildan multiclassed into Paladin in the first campaign.</p><p><b>Wizard (Prerequisite: Intelligence 13)</b></p><p>Following even further in Caleb\u2019s footsteps, Nott can choose to improve her arcane abilities, with a 1st-level dip in wizard providing the following:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d6. Just like Caleb. A downgrade from a d8, but is offset by the other features.<br></li><li><b>Spellcasting</b>: Much like with Fjord, dipping into another casting class would makes things interesting for Nott but for a variety of different reasons.</li><ul><li>Three additional wizard cantrips and six 1st-level wizard spells in her spellbook.</li><li>Her total number of spell slots in relation to a full caster would be determined by her rogue levels divided by 3 (rounded down) and her wizard levels. In this case, the math would equal out to that of a 3rd level caster. She\u2019d still have access to 2nd-level slots, but no 2nd-level spells.</li><li>When choosing spells from her spellbook, she can only prepare a number of spells equal to her Intelligence modifier plus her wizard level (up to 4 spells).\u00a0</li><li>With a wizard dip, Nott gains the ability to cast certain spells as rituals. The casting time is extended by 10 minutes, but she can also avoid expending a slot. Even better, ritual spells don\u2019t have to be prepared in order to be cast AS rituals.</li><li>She now has more spell variety as opposed to normally being limited to enchantment/illusion spells (and Feather Fall).</li><li>She gains the ability to use a proper arcane focus in place of spell components that don\u2019t have to be consumed or require a cost.</li></ul><li>Arcane Recovery: Much like Caleb, she can recover some slots during a short rest once per day, the combined total being up to half of her wizard levels (rounded up). As a 1st-level Wizard, that\u2019s only 1 spell level, but it\u2019s also 1 spell level regained before taking a long rest.</li></ul><p>Phew! That\u2019s all, I hope.</p>",
                "content": "<p>This was originally going to be a write-up I wanted to submit to <a>@critrolestats</a>&#8203;, but seeing as they already have an article ready to go, I might as well share it here. And yes, this is pretty similar to what I had blogged before, but&hellip; oh well.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a more detailed description of what to expect.</p><p>\n\nAlso, this is all assuming that they remain in their base classes instead of multiclassing. That being said, I&rsquo;ll also go over the possible class paths they could take at level 7, should they pursue them, based on their ability scores and overall characterization.<br /></p><p>Also, beware. This is going to be a LONG POST as most of this I actually added in to supplement my initial write-up.</p><p>That being said&hellip; let&rsquo;s take a look! (Spoilers Under the Cut)</p><p>With the expedition into the harsh jungles of Urukaxl now\nwrapped up, and the &ldquo;reward&rdquo; of Uk&rsquo;otoa in the inner depths of the temple now claimed\nby Captain Avantika, the Mighty Nein take the opportunity to rest and recover\naboard the Squall Eater en route to Darktow, elevating to level 7 in the process!\nJust like with their previous level advancement, this one provides the Nein\nwith several new boons at their disposal.<br /></p><p><b>The Sentinel Babes: Beauregard and Yasha</b></p><p><b>Base Classes</b></p><p>The Sentinel Babes do one thing very well, and that is kicking ass and taking names&hellip; with a preferred focus on the former, since words quickly become moot once they start thrashing. But the differences in how they approach combat and their class features at level 7 couldn&rsquo;t be more apparent.</p><p><b>Beau</b></p><p>Aside from gaining a new ki point maximum of 7, Beau gains access to a familiar defensive ability in the form of Evasion.\nMuch like with Vax&rsquo;ildan in Campaign 1, Evasion will allow Beau to avoid damage\nagainst area-of-effect attacks that require a Dexterity save (something which\nmonks are already very good at), taking only half damage on a failed save and\nNO damage on a success.</p><p>Beau also gains access to Stillness of Mind. If she is under\nan effect where she is charmed or frightened, she can use her action to end the\neffect, which can be quite beneficial in the right circumstances.</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>Considering her keen mind (her actual inquisitive intellect, not the feat; that&rsquo;s Caleb&rsquo;s) and ability to adapt to situations with the tools she has, Beau does have the following options aside from taking another level in monk at this juncture:</p><p><b>Fighter (Prerequisites: Strength 13 or Dexterity 13)</b></p><p>While lacking with a Strength of 10, her Dexterity of 18 does qualify for a Fighter dip. Fighters in themselves are quite versatile, especially when taking their subclasses into account. But seeing as this is merely for a 1st-level dip, this is what Beau would gain:</p><ul><li>Hit die: d10. A step up from her usual d8. A slightly higher chance for more HP can make all the difference.</li><li>Proficiency in simple and martial weapons. Sadly, I don&rsquo;t think that Beau&rsquo;s Martial Arts feature applies to them unless she was a Kensei monk, which she isn&rsquo;t.</li><li>Proficiency in light armor, medium armor, and shields. Not that monks need them; they benefit the most without it. Besides, Beau&rsquo;s got kickass bracers as well, so who needs armor?</li><li>Fighting Style: Much like past Fighters in both campaigns with known styles such as Percy (Archery, +2 to ranged attack rolls), Shale (Dueling, +2 damage with one-handed weapons), and Keg (Two-Weapon Fighting, off-hand attacks get added damage from their ability modifier), Beau&rsquo;s style as a level 1 Fighter would most likely be Great Weapon Fighting, where a 1 or 2 on the damage die of a two-handed/versatile weapon (like her staff) can be rerolled, but the new roll must be used, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.<br /></li><ul><li>Alternatively, if she were to start using shortswords or daggers, another option is Two-Weapon Fighting, especially since daggers are monk weapons and thus the damage die can change due to the Martial Arts feature. Daggers also benefit from the Archery style as they can be thrown as ranged weapons.</li></ul><li>Second Wind: Again, like past Fighters, Beau could use a bonus action to heal hit points equal to 1d10 + her Fighter level (in this case, up to 11). And much like her ki points, Second Wind recharges after a short rest. A good way to extend her survivability if the clerics are low on spells and potions are all expended.<br /></li></ul><p><b>Rogue (Prerequisite: Dexterity 13)</b></p><p>In terms of ability scores, Beau&rsquo;s already got it made with this one. Having a second rogue in the party would help a bit when it comes to stealth and subterfuge. And even for just a 1st-level dip, Beau already would start off with:</p><ul><li>Hit Die: d8. Same as what she usually rolls.</li><li>Proficiency in light armor, one skill from the class&rsquo;s skill list, and thieves&rsquo; tools. While the armor and tool proficiencies are a waste (Beau is already has the tool proficiency due to her background), the chance to learn an extra skill is the real draw. For starters, she could put that toward Perception, making sure that her senses are much more aware.</li><li>Expertise: While her Athletics already benefits from this thanks to her Prodigy feat as a variant human, this class feature can bolster two more of her skills and/or tools. Very useful, especially if it&rsquo;s for Insight, Perception, or Investigation. Three skills, aside from Stealth, that are vital for rogues (or even inquisitive monks like her) to have.</li><li>Thieves&rsquo; Cant: The quintessential secret language of rogues. Pretty much the verbal equivalent of &ldquo;hiding in plain sight&rdquo;. Not sure if Beau technically knows it already, but it&rsquo;s there as a feature.</li><li>Sneak Attack (1d6): Despite only doing the most damage up close, the benefits of Sneak Attack can still be applied if she&rsquo;s adjacent to or flanking with another ally (most often than not Yasha). <b><i>However</i></b>, the added damage must come from a finesse weapon like her throwing stars. Sadly, unarmed strikes and staves are not. Besides, &ldquo;punches thrown with finesse&rdquo; ain&rsquo;t Beau&rsquo;s thing. That, and while darts/throwing stars are finesse, they are not melee weapons, therefore they don&rsquo;t benefit from the increasing Martial Arts damage die. That being said, daggers (which are finesse, can be thrown, AND are melee weapons) DO benefit from not just Martial Arts, but also Sneak Attack. Taking that into account, it may be time for Beau to start taking courses in Cobalt Soul Knife Tossing.</li></ul><p><b>Yasha</b></p><p>As for Yasha, not only does she get to heal someone for 7 points with her Healing Hands, but she also gains a vital perk with Feral Instinct. Just like with Grog and other barbarians in Campaign 1, Feral Instinct allows Yasha to roll with advantage on initiative.<br /></p><p>In addition, Feral Instinct makes it so that if she is not incapacitated when surprised at the start of combat, she can act normally on her first turn, provided that she begins with raging beforehand.</p><p><b>Possible Multiclassing</b></p><p>Pretty much the only thing that would fit Yasha would be Fighter for the same reasons as Beau.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Two Mercys</b><b>&nbsp;and a Bookworm: Jester Lavorre, Caduceus Clay, and Caleb Widogast</b></p><p><b>Base Classes</b></p><p>Level 7 is quite often a great boon for casters.
