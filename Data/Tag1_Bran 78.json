In each of them, about 2/3 of the content are repurposed clips and 1/3 are new content. These are meant to be both allegorical and prophetic because they contain events that haven\u2019t happened yet. They can be divided into blocks according to thematic and with the help of audio-visual cues.</p><h2>S0402 - The Lion and the Rose<br/></h2><p>The first prophetic vision is divided thanks to <b>[1]</b> clips featuring the Weirwood Heart Tree with the sun behind them going from dawn to dusk, which is an allegory for\u00a0\u201ctime travelling\u201d through the Weirwood Network and <b>[2]</b> a black fade-out and a white flash-in, followed by a drum-like sound effect. In broad strokes, the resulting subsets represent what Bran is going to be looking at each season from that point forth. I\u2019ve analysed this one in detail in another post a long time ago (<a href=\"http://une-nuit-pour-se-souvenir.tumblr.com/post/181453355830/brans-vision-cluster-1-got-s04e02\">can be found here</a>), so I\u2019ll only post the conclusions.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/587648df956033a4e7c884983a8ff163/tumblr_inline_pppmaeTYXv1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\"/></figure><p><b>First \u201cLine\u201d:</b></p><p>The sun is slight to the left of the Weirwood, representing the recent past to the present. It\u2019s followed by tree roots and the Three-Eyed Raven, representing the Three-Eyed Raven and his ability to &ldquo;time travel\u201d through the Weirwood Network. The drum-like sound effect separates that from a segment featuring Eddard Stark sharpening ice and watching fire flare while a captive in King\u2019s Landing, representing Ned\u2019s story during Robert\u2019s Rebellion where he fought against the Targaryans for the sake of his sister Lyanna Stark (sharpening ice), witnessed the birth of Jon Snow (fire reflected in his eyes), and promised his sister that he\u2019d protect him (captivity).</p><p><b>Second \u201cLine\u201d:</b> The sun going all the way to the extreme left of the Weirwood, representing the distant past. It\u2019s followed by the Three-Eyed Raven prancing on a tree, then four clips relating to the Army of the Dead. The first and last are from when Sam slew the White Walker who had come to take Little Sam so he could be taken and transformed into another White Walker, what they flank is the first appearance of a wight, therefore this represents the creation of the Night King and the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead.</p><p><b>Third \u201cLine\u201d:</b> The sun going back to slight to the left of the Weirwood and the centre, representing the recent past to the present, then at the very end going to the extreme right, representing the future. It\u2019s followed by the Army of the Dead\u2019s invasion and a metaphorical representation of Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The drum-like sound effect separates that from a segment with prophetic visions, the Night King seen through a wall of ice and a dragon flying over King\u2019s Landing, interspersed with clips of a raven and Bran falling of the Broken Tower of Winterfell, which represent the future fight against both the forces of ice (Night King and the Army of the Dead) and fire (Danerys and the dragons).<br/></p><p>The frozen wasteland with the sun hanging low on the horizon, representing the Long Night or the weirwood roots in the third line, representing going into the past, don\u2019t really matter where they belong exactly since both clips could fit into either previous or following line equally. The <b>Long Night</b> is relevant to both the first Long Night when the Night King and the Army of the Dead were created (the story told in the second\u00a0\u201cline\u201d) and the second Long Night since Jon\u2019s parentage is going to be relevant (the story told in the \u201dfirst line\u201d). Likewise, the <b>weirwood roots</b> which represent \u201ctime travelling\u201d as the Three-Eyed Raven is relevant to both Bran checking out the Night King and the Army of the Dead were created (the story told in the second \u201cline\u201d) and Bran checking out the Army of the Dead\u2019s invasion and Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne (the story told in the third \u201cline\u201d).</p><h2>S06E06 - Blood of My Blood <br/></h2><p>The second prophetic vision is divided thanks to <b>[1]</b> the transitions between Bran tripping out and the present as well as <b>[2]</b> the thematic which can be divided into either fire or ice. In broad strokes, the resulting three subsets represent the war against both ice (Night King and the Army of the Dead) and fire (Danerys and the dragons).</p><p>This is allusive to this franchise\u2019s title, <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, a poem by Robert Frost that characterises both fire and ice as equally destructive forces that threaten humanity. Therefore, <b>#1</b> represents these destructive forces of ice and fire as equals, <b>#2</b> represents the conflict against fire and <b>#3</b> represents the conflict against ice. In specific, #3 is the most difficult to get since it contains a \u201cfire\u201d segment and the \u201cice\u201d segment interwoven with the present.

This fits with the R\u2019hllor and Great Other religion duality, on one side there\u2019s R\u2019hllor and Azor Ahai (which is Danerys, since she fits all the requirements) and on the other side there\u2019s the Great Other.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"767\" data-orig-height=\"287\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70df6c177d87b4489590e84e01ab63e7/tumblr_inline_ppogpuyKcx1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"767\" data-orig-height=\"287\"/></figure><p>This parallel had already been alluded to in Bran\u2019s first cluster vision in <i>S04E02 - The Lion and the Rose</i>, where it features in the \u201cfuture\u201d segment.

They are both preceded by <b>[1]</b> Drogon flying over the Valyrian ruins and <b>[2]</b> a dragon flying over King\u2019s Landing. This is repeated SIX TIMES through the whole vision, with Aerys two times and Danerys two times, then the latter is repeated twice in #2 the \u201cfire\u201d segment of the story. The dragon over King\u2019s Landing is supposed to be Drogon, because 6/6 the dragon that precedes it is always Drogon and 4/6 is followed by Danerys with Drogon over her shoulder.</p><p>Moreover, Aerys screaming \u201c<i>burn them all</i>\u201d meant burning King\u2019s Landing with wildfire is the clip that is \u201creplaced\u201d with Danerys and Drogon, which means Danerys is burning King\u2019s Landing just like her father wanted. I\u2019m not sure if that missing dragon over KIng\u2019s Landing is an encoding error or on purpose, but if it\u2019s on purpose than it symbolises that Aerys didn\u2019t manage to burn it but that Danerys will definitely burn it. Furthermore, Danerys with Drogon over her shoulder has the dothraki kneeling in the background, which suggests that her reasons for burning King\u2019s Landing is to force the Seven Kingdoms to kneel too and recognise her as their queen.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3852\" data-orig-height=\"2872\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a52d9e44864c15ace51683f050e3e11f/tumblr_inline_ppomp46AK71rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3852\" data-orig-height=\"2872\"/></figure><p>There is plenty of foreshadowing that Danerys will burn King\u2019s Landing, which I enclose two major examples. In the show, this is represented Danerys seeing King\u2019s Landing destroyed at the House of Undying in <i>S02E10 - Valar Morghulis</i> (it\u2019s worth noting that in specific, this one made it to Bran\u2019s first prophetic vision as well) In the books, this is represented by Danerys seeing Aerys ordering his pyromancers to burn the city and Rhaego burning a city riddle (symbolising Danerys as the Stallion that Mounts the World, since Danerys + Drogo<strike>n</strike> = Rhaego, will destroy King\u2019s Landing with the dothraki).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85257e1a9947cd0c126ecd785fdb277a/tumblr_inline_pppqonfoCb1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\"/></figure><p>It\u2019s worth mentioning that in the books, Aerys orders the pyromancers to burn the city (\u201dburn them all\u201d) is answered by Drogon screeching while standing on Danerys\u2019 shoulder and this is precisely the imagery that is paralleled in the show, Aerys screaming \u201cburn them all\u201d which is replaced by Danerys with Drogon screeching while standing over her shoulder, which follows the clip of a dragon flying over King\u2019s Landing.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"477\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dad1655e72e9efa1b57a05b0d6c787c6/tumblr_inline_popvfrwXhf1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"477\"/></figure><p><b>CONCLUSION: What this represents is that Danerys will do what her father dearest couldn\u2019t and burn King\u2019s Landing, in hopes of forcing the Seven Kingdoms to kneel and declare her queen.<br/></b></p>\n\n<h2>[D] THE STARKS<br/></h2><p>The fantastical scenario of both Bran as the Three-Eyed Raven and the destructive forces of ice and fire, also come along with two mundane events that involve the Starks. Somehow, the Song of Ice and Fire should involve the Starks in a more mundane fashion, of betrayals and the like.</p><p><b>[D1] THE RED WEDDING</b><br/></p><p>The first of these is the <b>Red Wedding</b>, which is an event that keeps coming up in prophetic visions. In the show, the scene where Danerys enters the House of Undying in <i>S02E10 - Valar Morghulis</i>, is preceded by Robb marrying Talisa which is what triggered the Red Wedding, furthermore the scenes of Danerys\u2019 invasion of Yunkai in <i>S03E09 - The Rains of Castamere</i>, are interwoven with the Red Wedding proper. In the books, Danerys sees the Red Wedding in one of the House of Undying visions as well.</p><p><b> </b>This recurrence of the Red Wedding in prophetic visions suggests that some thing similar will happen in the future. <b>In it\u2019s essence, the Red Wedding is about person A breaking oaths for love to person B, then that person B seeking excessive retribution since they\u2019re dangerous and vindictive, person B murdering person A and all their retinue by breaking guest-right, and person B usurping person A of their lands and titles.</b></p><p>In the books, there is the foreshadowing of what this might mean since one of the fake people that Danerys finds invites her to share food, which means guest-right. In broad-strokes, Danerys enters a room through a double-door which resembles the House of Black and White which is an assassin guild who disguise themselves as other people to carry out their assassination attempts. This foreshadows that whoever Danerys finds inside represents real people whose intentions will be concealed but whose objective are the dragons, and that they will be responsible for her demise.</p><p>In two posts back, I\u2019ve exhaustively analysed what House of Undying chapter in the books might mean. In specific, I theorised that the kingly man represents Jon Snow inviting Danerys to Winterfell (sharing food = guest-right) to fight the Army of the Dead, since he fits all the requirements (the others are the other Starks and Theon Greyjoy) and that Danerys is \u201cWalder Frey\u201d because she\u2019s a dangerous and vindictive person just like him. Moreover, I\u2019ve also theorised that a further vision represents Danerys outing herself as Azor Ahai and proving herself not the hero that people should cheer for, by burning Winterfell. Since Danerys would be under guest-right, burning Winterfell would break it.<br/></p><p>This analysis fits with the way Bran\u2019s second vision is structured. The clip of the Red Wedding follows the Long Night clip, which suggests this Red Wedding V2 will happen ETA: <strike>during</strike> after the Long Night, and Jon convinced Danerys to march North so she\u2019d fight the Army of the Dead. The clip is followed by the negative association between Danerys and the Night King, which suggests that she\u2019s the fire counterpart to the Army of the Dead (aka Azor Ahai and R\u2019hllor versus Great Other), and burning Winterfell or King\u2019s Landing would be that.</p><p>As a side-note, it\u2019s Catelyn Tully that is being assassinated, which suggests a major character associated with Cat would die as a result (it\u2019s \u201cdie\u201d lol, don\u2019t fret). There are some good theories that Sansa Stark, which the show loves to visually make as Cat v2, will be kidnapped from Winterfell before it burns and yet be mistaken for dead for some time in the aftermath. In the show, there\u2019s a surprising number of foreshadowing for this, I\u2019ve read several metas that talk about it. In the books, there\u2019s foreshadowing for this as well:</p><ul><li><b>AGOT #50 Arya #4:</b> Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She\u2019d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who\u2019d been no bigger than Rickon was now. (&hellip;) \u201cThere are worse things than spiders and rats,\u201d he whispered. <b>\u201cThis is where the dead walk.\u201d That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery.</b> Baby Bran had clutched at Arya\u2019s hand. <b>When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs</b>, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb\u2019s leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch.

The first clip is Ned sharpening Ice, with which he\u2019d end up beheaded with. The second clip is Ned as a prisoner in the dungeons of the Red Keep.

It was (greatly) preceded by the Weirwood Heart Tree above the Three-Eyed Raven cave, with the sun having travelled from the centre of the image to slightly right, which is an allegory for going slightly back in time.

In Bran\u2019s first prophetic vision, it\u2019s about the secret of his real parentage, which Ned witnessed and took to the chopping block, and that Bran saw through the Weirwood Network. In Bran\u2019s second prophetic vision, it\u2019s about Jon being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, since Joffrey Baratheon isn\u2019t that and that boy is even a foil for him (Joffrey is the bastard posing as a prince while Jon is the prince posing as a bastard). Then Joffrey, someone who isn\u2019t the rightful heir to the Iron Throne but pretends that he is, moreover who\u2019s vindictive, represents Danerys because this exactly what is going to happen once she finds out.</p><p>This one is more \u201cfamiliar\u201d in prophetic visions, it represents the <b>Dance of Dragons v2</b>. In the show, it shows up in the House of Undying visions as a grill on the floor, foreshadowing it since this framing was used for Joffrey (!) when he was talking about the Dance of Dragons v1, and the blasted King\u2019s Landing throne room which is covered in snow, foreshadowing since it comes right after Danerys is informed that Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne because of the blue flower on the wall and the Iron Throne covered in snow. In the books, it shows up in the House of Undying as well, in the vision where Rhaegar pretty much says he had another child (\u201dthere must be one more\u201d since \u201cthe dragon has three heads\u201d) and Danerys mistakes him for Viserys, whom she usurped.<br/></p><p>\n<b>What this scene represents is that Jon and Danerys will fight in the Dance of Dragons v2 over the Iron Throne, perhaps even despite Jon has abdicated in her favour in hopes of saving his beloved sisters and because Danerys is dangerous and vindictive.</b><br/></p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"19260\" data-orig-height=\"3590\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a46bdc9accd2d0b04ec57d13b0752edf/tumblr_inline_ppob74XPeo1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"19260\" data-orig-height=\"3590\"/></figure><h2><b>#2 - THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE OF FIRE</b></h2><p>This segment can also be \u201cdivided\u201d by three clips of wildfire exploding.

In the show, this is represented by Danerys passing the torch over the blue flower on the wall at the House of Undying in <i>S02E10 - Valar Morghulis</i>. In the books, this is represented by Danerys seeing the Red Wedding (breaking guest-right) and seeing Drogon taking flight from a smoking tower, as well as Bran as Summer seeing a \u201cdragon\u201d over a smoking Winterfell in the aftermath of the Bolton\u2019s sacking the castle \n(ETA: who knows really, Danerys burned shit during the Battle against \nthe Army of the Dead, though not like I expected it, so this means that this is only for her contribution, she may burn it later, or \nit might be \ndifferent in the books).<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"7704\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ede82c9039125d473dac8e3218029bd4/tumblr_inline_pppthyVL4d1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"7704\" data-orig-height=\"718\"/></figure><p><b>What this scene represents is that Danerys will burn Winterfell as a result of the Night King and the Army of the Dead\u2019s invasion.</b> <br/></p><p><b>THE NIGHT KING\u2019S OBJECTIVE?</b><br/></p><p>There is a single detail about this which is quite important. The clip that follows the Night King converting Craster\u2019s baby into a White Walker, is a clip with a raven murder from when Sam slew a White Walker that was coming after Gilly\u2019s baby (another of Craster\u2019s baby). This thematic allusion cannot be taken lightly, especially because this same reference was made in Bran\u2019s first prophetic vision. There, two clips from that scene (weirwood tree and raven murder) flank the wights from Waymar\u2019s Royce expedition beyond the Wall.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3600\" data-orig-height=\"807\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/382744ab916463080df1dc6d88099fd8/tumblr_inline_pppssvjYHP1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3600\" data-orig-height=\"807\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/744c1708230ccd85f65c722f989ee7ce/tumblr_inline_ppps1sjXfz1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\"/></figure><p>This insistence with the Night King and Craster\u2019s babies suggests that the Night King and the Army of the Dead might have come south because of little Sam. Personally, I feel like all this trouble for a baby is a weak story, furthermore doesn\u2019t fit with the duality of ice and fire. It doesn\u2019t explain why the R\u2019hllor religion portrays both fire and ice as enemies to each other, it doesn\u2019t explain why conveniently the Army of the Dead started getting stronger about the same time that Danerys started getting stronger (hatched the dragons), it doesn\u2019t explain with the Night King\u2019s original mission of being created to fight humans who burned trees and the like. In my personal opinion. Night King and the Army of the Dead started getting stronger to counter the dragons getting stronger (so this is all Danerys\u2019 fault), but they\u2019re also looking for Craster\u2019s baby as a side-quest so they can add him to their ranks to destroy Danerys with (ETA: as of 8x3 nobody knows because the writers don\u2019t care about the magic plot).<br/></p><h2>BURNING OF KING\u2019S LANDING</h2><p>This segment is mostly a \u201cflashback\u201d to Robert\u2019s Rebellion, but there are a few odd \u201cpresent\u201d events as well, which outs this thing as both showing the past and how these are a representation of the future storyline.

In particular, Arya is dressed in emerald armour which makes her either armed by Gendry and / or \u201cRenly\u2019s ghost\u201d just like Garlan Tyrell at Blackwater. There are some theories that Danerys and Melisandre will burn Gendry for his king\u2019s blood, which would fit into this.

ETA:\n<strike>It was suggested in #2 that Danerys burns Winterfell. Together, these foreshadow that Danerys will burn Winterfell (\u201dburn them all\u201d) and outing herself as the destructive force of fire as a counterpart to the Night King and the Army of the Dead.</strike> As of 8x3, it foreshadowed that Danerys and the dragons are absolutely useless, <strike>so much shit time spent on this the writers really suck</strike>.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5136\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e6325add9bdbf206dce703e1afdaf19/tumblr_inline_pponqwlDHC1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5136\" data-orig-height=\"718\"/></figure><p><b>[2]</b> The pyromancers stashing more wildfire pots and then leaving, while not being followed by Aerys screaming, highly suggests that Danerys also leaves the fight against the Night King and the Army of the Dead halfway (ETA: confirmed in 8x3, since Danerys fled briefly, which foreshadows she\u2019ll flee again). Since what follows is the pyromancers stashing more wildfire pots, it highly suggests that Danerys leaves to protect the dragons and to save her strength for other fights. In hindsight, this means Danerys chooses to leave because she is the mother of dragons and prioritises being a power-hungry warmonger obsessed with the Iron Throne, over being the mother of people and being a saviour.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"179\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4daca6294db41f986d6c868ea6b77e76/tumblr_inline_pponv4ryXW1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"179\"/></figure><h2>THE BATTLE OF WINTERFELL<br/></h2><p>The second stanza is about Bran watching the Night King and the Army of the Dead invading, then watches him as he raises the dead. He\u2019s really the \u201conly\u201d one that matters in this fight, not Danerys or whoever else. I\u2019m assuming the key to defeating the Night King and the Army of the Dead can only be achieved through Bran so even if another slays him for real (I\u2019m betting Jon), it could\u2019ve been any other that it wouldn\u2019t really matter \n(ETA: confirmed in 8x3).</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that this stanza is composed by repurposing two scenes, the first is about the Battle at Hardhome in <i>S05E08 - Hardhome</i> and the second is about Bran checking out the Army of the Dead and meeting the Night King where he branded him in <i>S06E05 - The Door</i>. Below, the whole thing divided, the former in yellow and the latter in green.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"71\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d32baf7965c9a8214a11fe5ae6a8a58/tumblr_inline_ppq21gtz431rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"71\"/></figure><p>There are two things about this. The first is that this arrangement suggests that the first part is independent of Bran while the second part is dependent on Bran. The second is that the Army of the Dead breaks a door twice. What this means to me is that the wall breaking means the Wall proper (which Bran isn\u2019t involved in since he\u2019s not there, while the two doors mean Winterfell (which Bran is involved because he\u2019s at Winterfell.

In both, there are animated decomposed bodies so to me this really means the dead Starks are all coming back, as well as Jon is present in both fights and he\u2019s going to play some major role in it (ETA: partly confirmed in 8x3, Jon forced the Night King out of the dragon and on foot, but Jon\u2019s actually pretty useless so I\u2019ll say half-half).</p><p>The third is flanked by the Night King animating corpses, the first is after he raised his arms and the last is them raising. The fourth is followed by the Army of the Dead calmly marching south. <b><i>It suggests they win the fight.</i></b> (ETA: confirmed in 8x3, the Night King and his pals did win the fight, they were only stopped because Arya ninja\u2019d the Night King)<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"119\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcf138a43ce5e26a4d2adcbdc58f3f5c/tumblr_inline_ppq1m7nE2o1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"119\"/></figure><p>The second stanza is actually continued in the fifth stanza. Bran is still watching the Night King and the Army of the Dead, but this time the Night King comes head-on with Bran. There are two things about this. The first is that Aerys is screaming \u201c<i>burn them all</i>\u201d in the background, which was added in specific for this vision, and the second is that the Night King reaches for Bran\u2019s arm. It foreshadows that the Night King will reach for Bran (ETA: confirmed in 8x3, the Night King was baited into the godswood by Bran).<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"6420\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/60cfb713aef0150e1c387a1fa087f169/tumblr_inline_ppq391hO7N1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"6420\" data-orig-height=\"718\"/></figure><h2>THE NIGHT KING\u2019S OBJECTIVE<br/></h2><p>The Night King was created by the Children of the Forest, a human captured that they turned into the first White Walker. Their objective was to use these creatures to fight humans, since they had invaded Westeros and were cutting the Weirwood Heart Trees, as well as slaughtering them all. However, their creations soon turned against him, forcing the Children of the Forest and the humans to ally themselves against this threat, somehow they won and the Night King and the Army of the Dead was forced to go back into the Lands of Always Winter where they hid for centuries.</p><p>The alliance between the Children of the Forest and the humans is known as \u201cThe Pact\u201d. Supposedly, the two sides were tired of the bloodshed, but this is hogwash because <b>the humans were winning</b>. Nobody files for peace when winning. However, they did make that alliance against the Night King, so most likely the biggest reason why \u201cThe Pact\u201d was forged was to fight the Night King as a unit. Regardless, both parts agreed that the forest would belong to the Children of the Forest while the open lands would belong to the humans, plus that the latter would never cut down a weirwood ever again.</p><p>The way the show depicts this pact is similar to the way the Night King grabs Bran\u2019s arm, just in the latter case it\u2019s meant as a \u201cbroken\u201d pact of sorts. This shouldn\u2019t be a coincidence, otherwise, the Night King would just grab him anywhere else. Supposedly, the Night King touching Bran has branded him and that from now on, the Night King knows where Bran is and he\u2019ll come looking for him. Benjen Stark also implies this, that the Night King will come for Bran. Either way, neither speaks in a threatening manner.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fee92e553e18ddf52085f779882e648/tumblr_inline_ppq3u5tp8g1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"360\"/></figure><p>This suggests two things. The Night King and the Army of the Dead is attacking because \u201cThe Pact\u201d was broken as well as because the dragons were brought back to Westeros (Aerys saying \u201d<i>burn them all</i>\u201d). The latter makes a lot of sense since fire is a destructive force after all, it would burn a lot of trees so of course that as their elemental counterparts they\u2019d wish to delete them from existence (magic breeds magic in <i>ASOIAF</i>, it\u2019s specifically said that Danerys\u2019 dragons enhanced magic). The second is that Bran will have to make forge a new pact for peace (ETA: confirmed and not confirmed in 8x3, the Night King came for Bran was true but there was nothing else from the winter lore, since D&amp;D don\u2019t give a damn about the magic plot <strike>can you tell I\u2019m angry, my boy Bran and Jon were both robbed, ROBBED, at least the silver lining is that it was a Stark of Winterfell who did the deed</strike>).<br/></p>",

In each of them, about 2/3 of the content are repurposed clips and 1/3 are new content. These are meant to be both allegorical and prophetic because they contain events that haven\u2019t happened yet. They can be divided into blocks according to thematic and with the help of audio-visual cues.</p><h2>S0402 - The Lion and the Rose<br></h2><p>The first prophetic vision is divided thanks to <b>[1]</b> clips featuring the Weirwood Heart Tree with the sun behind them going from dawn to dusk, which is an allegory for\u00a0\u201ctime travelling\u201d through the Weirwood Network and <b>[2]</b> a black fade-out and a white flash-in, followed by a drum-like sound effect. In broad strokes, the resulting subsets represent what Bran is going to be looking at each season from that point forth. I\u2019ve analysed this one in detail in another post a long time ago (<a href=\"http://une-nuit-pour-se-souvenir.tumblr.com/post/181453355830/brans-vision-cluster-1-got-s04e02\">can be found here</a>), so I\u2019ll only post the conclusions.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/587648df956033a4e7c884983a8ff163/tumblr_inline_pppmaeTYXv1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\"></figure><p><b>First \u201cLine\u201d:</b></p><p>The sun is slight to the left of the Weirwood, representing the recent past to the present. It\u2019s followed by tree roots and the Three-Eyed Raven, representing the Three-Eyed Raven and his ability to \u201ctime travel\u201d through the Weirwood Network. The drum-like sound effect separates that from a segment featuring Eddard Stark sharpening ice and watching fire flare while a captive in King\u2019s Landing, representing Ned\u2019s story during Robert\u2019s Rebellion where he fought against the Targaryans for the sake of his sister Lyanna Stark (sharpening ice), witnessed the birth of Jon Snow (fire reflected in his eyes), and promised his sister that he\u2019d protect him (captivity).</p><p><b>Second \u201cLine\u201d:</b> The sun going all the way to the extreme left of the Weirwood, representing the distant past. It\u2019s followed by the Three-Eyed Raven prancing on a tree, then four clips relating to the Army of the Dead. The first and last are from when Sam slew the White Walker who had come to take Little Sam so he could be taken and transformed into another White Walker, what they flank is the first appearance of a wight, therefore this represents the creation of the Night King and the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead.</p><p><b>Third \u201cLine\u201d:</b> The sun going back to slight to the left of the Weirwood and the centre, representing the recent past to the present, then at the very end going to the extreme right, representing the future. It\u2019s followed by the Army of the Dead\u2019s invasion and a metaphorical representation of Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The drum-like sound effect separates that from a segment with prophetic visions, the Night King seen through a wall of ice and a dragon flying over King\u2019s Landing, interspersed with clips of a raven and Bran falling of the Broken Tower of Winterfell, which represent the future fight against both the forces of ice (Night King and the Army of the Dead) and fire (Danerys and the dragons).<br></p><p>The frozen wasteland with the sun hanging low on the horizon, representing the Long Night or the weirwood roots in the third line, representing going into the past, don\u2019t really matter where they belong exactly since both clips could fit into either previous or following line equally. The <b>Long Night</b> is relevant to both the first Long Night when the Night King and the Army of the Dead were created (the story told in the second\u00a0\u201cline\u201d) and the second Long Night since Jon\u2019s parentage is going to be relevant (the story told in the \u201dfirst line\u201d). Likewise, the <b>weirwood roots</b> which represent \u201ctime travelling\u201d as the Three-Eyed Raven is relevant to both Bran checking out the Night King and the Army of the Dead were created (the story told in the second \u201cline\u201d) and Bran checking out the Army of the Dead\u2019s invasion and Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne (the story told in the third \u201cline\u201d).</p><h2>S06E06 - Blood of My Blood <br></h2><p>The second prophetic vision is divided thanks to <b>[1]</b> the transitions between Bran tripping out and the present as well as <b>[2]</b> the thematic which can be divided into either fire or ice. In broad strokes, the resulting three subsets represent the war against both ice (Night King and the Army of the Dead) and fire (Danerys and the dragons).</p><p>This is allusive to this franchise\u2019s title, <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, a poem by Robert Frost that characterises both fire and ice as equally destructive forces that threaten humanity. Therefore, <b>#1</b> represents these destructive forces of ice and fire as equals, <b>#2</b> represents the conflict against fire and <b>#3</b> represents the conflict against ice. In specific, #3 is the most difficult to get since it contains a \u201cfire\u201d segment and the \u201cice\u201d segment interwoven with the present. I\u2019ll justify why I divided them this way later. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"557\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f45b006d73c8fb9e185b7852f907433c/tumblr_inline_pppn0wfHIN1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"557\"></figure><h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAN STARK<b><br></b></h2><p>Something that is in common with both prophetic visions is the clips featuring Bran falling off the Burned Tower of Winterfell, the raven prancing around, the weirwood tree roots, and the frozen wasteland with the sun hanging low.</p><p><b>THE LONG NIGHT</b><br></p><p><b>[A]</b> The frozen wasteland, with really busy clouds in the sky and the sunrise with the sun hanging really, matches what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXxRcXHI_tI\">the sun\u2019s trajectory</a> looks closer to the northern or southern pole during winter. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_path\">It\u2019s a bizarre notion for the majority of people since they live far away from it, but that\u2019s exactly how it goes.</a> This is meant as an allegory for the Long Night, since extreme winter has come.

Somehow, the Song of Ice and Fire should involve the Starks in a more mundane fashion, of betrayals and the like.</p><p><b>[D1] THE RED WEDDING</b><br></p><p>The first of these is the <b>Red Wedding</b>, which is an event that keeps coming up in prophetic visions. In the show, the scene where Danerys enters the House of Undying in <i>S02E10 - Valar Morghulis</i>, is preceded by Robb marrying Talisa which is what triggered the Red Wedding, furthermore the scenes of Danerys\u2019 invasion of Yunkai in <i>S03E09 - The Rains of Castamere</i>, are interwoven with the Red Wedding proper. In the books, Danerys sees the Red Wedding in one of the House of Undying visions as well.</p><p><b> </b>This recurrence of the Red Wedding in prophetic visions suggests that some thing similar will happen in the future. <b>In it\u2019s essence, the Red Wedding is about person A breaking oaths for love to person B, then that person B seeking excessive retribution since they\u2019re dangerous and vindictive, person B murdering person A and all their retinue by breaking guest-right, and person B usurping person A of their lands and titles.</b></p><p>In the books, there is the foreshadowing of what this might mean since one of the fake people that Danerys finds invites her to share food, which means guest-right. In broad-strokes, Danerys enters a room through a double-door which resembles the House of Black and White which is an assassin guild who disguise themselves as other people to carry out their assassination attempts. This foreshadows that whoever Danerys finds inside represents real people whose intentions will be concealed but whose objective are the dragons, and that they will be responsible for her demise.</p><p>In two posts back, I\u2019ve exhaustively analysed what House of Undying chapter in the books might mean. In specific, I theorised that the kingly man represents Jon Snow inviting Danerys to Winterfell (sharing food = guest-right) to fight the Army of the Dead, since he fits all the requirements (the others are the other Starks and Theon Greyjoy) and that Danerys is \u201cWalder Frey\u201d because she\u2019s a dangerous and vindictive person just like him. Moreover, I\u2019ve also theorised that a further vision represents Danerys outing herself as Azor Ahai and proving herself not the hero that people should cheer for, by burning Winterfell. Since Danerys would be under guest-right, burning Winterfell would break it.<br></p><p>This analysis fits with the way Bran\u2019s second vision is structured. The clip of the Red Wedding follows the Long Night clip, which suggests this Red Wedding V2 will happen ETA: <strike>during</strike> after the Long Night, and Jon convinced Danerys to march North so she\u2019d fight the Army of the Dead. The clip is followed by the negative association between Danerys and the Night King, which suggests that she\u2019s the fire counterpart to the Army of the Dead (aka Azor Ahai and R\u2019hllor versus Great Other), and burning Winterfell or King\u2019s Landing would be that.</p><p>As a side-note, it\u2019s Catelyn Tully that is being assassinated, which suggests a major character associated with Cat would die as a result (it\u2019s \u201cdie\u201d lol, don\u2019t fret). There are some good theories that Sansa Stark, which the show loves to visually make as Cat v2, will be kidnapped from Winterfell before it burns and yet be mistaken for dead for some time in the aftermath. In the show, there\u2019s a surprising number of foreshadowing for this, I\u2019ve read several metas that talk about it. In the books, there\u2019s foreshadowing for this as well:</p><ul><li><b>AGOT #50 Arya #4:</b> Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She\u2019d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who\u2019d been no bigger than Rickon was now. (\u2026) \u201cThere are worse things than spiders and rats,\u201d he whispered. <b>\u201cThis is where the dead walk.\u201d That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery.</b> Baby Bran had clutched at Arya\u2019s hand. <b>When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs</b>, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb\u2019s leg, sobbing.

It was (greatly) preceded by the Weirwood Heart Tree above the Three-Eyed Raven cave, with the sun having travelled from the centre of the image to slightly right, which is an allegory for going slightly back in time.

In Bran\u2019s second prophetic vision, it\u2019s about Jon being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, since Joffrey Baratheon isn\u2019t that and that boy is even a foil for him (Joffrey is the bastard posing as a prince while Jon is the prince posing as a bastard). Then Joffrey, someone who isn\u2019t the rightful heir to the Iron Throne but pretends that he is, moreover who\u2019s vindictive, represents Danerys because this exactly what is going to happen once she finds out.</p><p>This one is more \u201cfamiliar\u201d in prophetic visions, it represents the <b>Dance of Dragons v2</b>. In the show, it shows up in the House of Undying visions as a grill on the floor, foreshadowing it since this framing was used for Joffrey (!) when he was talking about the Dance of Dragons v1, and the blasted King\u2019s Landing throne room which is covered in snow, foreshadowing since it comes right after Danerys is informed that Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne because of the blue flower on the wall and the Iron Throne covered in snow. In the books, it shows up in the House of Undying as well, in the vision where Rhaegar pretty much says he had another child (\u201dthere must be one more\u201d since \u201cthe dragon has three heads\u201d) and Danerys mistakes him for Viserys, whom she usurped.<br></p><p>\n<b>What this scene represents is that Jon and Danerys will fight in the Dance of Dragons v2 over the Iron Throne, perhaps even despite Jon has abdicated in her favour in hopes of saving his beloved sisters and because Danerys is dangerous and vindictive.</b><br></p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"19260\" data-orig-height=\"3590\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a46bdc9accd2d0b04ec57d13b0752edf/tumblr_inline_ppob74XPeo1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"19260\" data-orig-height=\"3590\"></figure><h2><b>#2 - THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE OF FIRE</b></h2><p>This segment can also be \u201cdivided\u201d by three clips of wildfire exploding.

It doesn\u2019t explain why the R\u2019hllor religion portrays both fire and ice as enemies to each other, it doesn\u2019t explain why conveniently the Army of the Dead started getting stronger about the same time that Danerys started getting stronger (hatched the dragons), it doesn\u2019t explain with the Night King\u2019s original mission of being created to fight humans who burned trees and the like. In my personal opinion. Night King and the Army of the Dead started getting stronger to counter the dragons getting stronger (so this is all Danerys\u2019 fault), but they\u2019re also looking for Craster\u2019s baby as a side-quest so they can add him to their ranks to destroy Danerys with (ETA: as of 8x3 nobody knows because the writers don\u2019t care about the magic plot).<br></p><h2>BURNING OF KING\u2019S LANDING</h2><p>This segment is mostly a \u201cflashback\u201d to Robert\u2019s Rebellion, but there are a few odd \u201cpresent\u201d events as well, which outs this thing as both showing the past and how these are a representation of the future storyline.

I do know this, I\u2019ve found PLENTY of foreshadowing that Danerys will ally herself with Euron and with Melisandre. Somehow those two should fit here in some way, but again\u2026 no idea.<br></p><p><b>[J1]</b> Jaime kills the pyromancers. The imagery is different from Aerys though, Jaime\u2019s shadow stabs the pyromancer\u2019s <i>shadow</i>, which means Arya\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d will stab a pyromancer\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d. The fact these are about shadows kind of hints it\u2019s about Melisandre and she fits with the one \u201cstashing wildfire pots\u201d imagery very well since she\u2019s obsessed with fire and blood-magic \n (ETA (8x3): no Melisandre, she\u2019s gooone, so either another priest of R\u2019hllor or bust).<br></p><p>In the books, Danerys meets some fake people at the House of Undying, which are meant to represent the Starks. In particular, Arya is dressed in emerald armour which makes her either armed by Gendry and / or \u201cRenly\u2019s ghost\u201d just like Garlan Tyrell at Blackwater. There are some theories that Danerys and Melisandre will burn Gendry for his king\u2019s blood, which would fit into this. Arya as \u201cGendry\u2019s ghost\u201d would take revenge on Gendry\u2019s behalf (he may survive or he may be kissed, it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019d die) against Melisandre as Danerys\u2019 \u201cghost\u201d by slaying her (ETA as of 8x2, Arya was armed by Gendry).<br></p><p><b>[J2]</b> The raven murder which meant the White Walkers coming for little Sam and Leaf creating the Night King. So by the exclusion of parts, this is (most likely) dealing with Euron Greyjoy. ETA: as of 8x3, it \u201cseems\u201d like Leaf meant Arya, so I\u2019ll revise this. Together, these actually fits the foreshadowing that Arya will kill Danerys with Bran\u2019s help.<br></p><p><strike>In the books, Euron fancies himself as becoming a god and he\u2019s trying to do something by using blood-magic, he\u2019s even recreating Danerys\u2019 funeral pyre but on a boat and with water instead. I actually have no idea. Maybe they\u2019ll want to do some blood-magic at the Trident, maybe Euron finds more dragon eggs and Danerys will think of hatching dragons by turning the Trident into a pyre.</strike><br></p><p><b>[J3]</b> Jaime again, drawing his sword against the NIght King.

Since what follows is the pyromancers stashing more wildfire pots, it highly suggests that Danerys leaves to protect the dragons and to save her strength for other fights. In hindsight, this means Danerys chooses to leave because she is the mother of dragons and prioritises being a power-hungry warmonger obsessed with the Iron Throne, over being the mother of people and being a saviour.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"179\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4daca6294db41f986d6c868ea6b77e76/tumblr_inline_pponv4ryXW1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"179\"></figure><h2>THE BATTLE OF WINTERFELL<br></h2><p>The second stanza is about Bran watching the Night King and the Army of the Dead invading, then watches him as he raises the dead.

Their objective was to use these creatures to fight humans, since they had invaded Westeros and were cutting the Weirwood Heart Trees, as well as slaughtering them all. However, their creations soon turned against him, forcing the Children of the Forest and the humans to ally themselves against this threat, somehow they won and the Night King and the Army of the Dead was forced to go back into the Lands of Always Winter where they hid for centuries.</p><p>The alliance between the Children of the Forest and the humans is known as \u201cThe Pact\u201d. Supposedly, the two sides were tired of the bloodshed, but this is hogwash because <b>the humans were winning</b>. Nobody files for peace when winning. However, they did make that alliance against the Night King, so most likely the biggest reason why \u201cThe Pact\u201d was forged was to fight the Night King as a unit. Regardless, both parts agreed that the forest would belong to the Children of the Forest while the open lands would belong to the humans, plus that the latter would never cut down a weirwood ever again.</p><p>The way the show depicts this pact is similar to the way the Night King grabs Bran\u2019s arm, just in the latter case it\u2019s meant as a \u201cbroken\u201d pact of sorts. This shouldn\u2019t be a coincidence, otherwise, the Night King would just grab him anywhere else. Supposedly, the Night King touching Bran has branded him and that from now on, the Night King knows where Bran is and he\u2019ll come looking for him. Benjen Stark also implies this, that the Night King will come for Bran.

The latter makes a lot of sense since fire is a destructive force after all, it would burn a lot of trees so of course that as their elemental counterparts they\u2019d wish to delete them from existence (magic breeds magic in <i>ASOIAF</i>, it\u2019s specifically said that Danerys\u2019 dragons enhanced magic). The second is that Bran will have to make forge a new pact for peace (ETA: confirmed and not confirmed in 8x3, the Night King came for Bran was true but there was nothing else from the winter lore, since D&amp;D don\u2019t give a damn about the magic plot <strike>can you tell I\u2019m angry, my boy Bran and Jon were both robbed, ROBBED, at least the silver lining is that it was a Stark of Winterfell who did the deed</strike>).<br></p></p>",

In each of them, about 2/3 of the content are repurposed clips and 1/3 are new content. These are meant to be both allegorical and prophetic because they contain events that haven\u2019t happened yet. They can be divided into blocks according to thematic and with the help of audio-visual cues.</p><h2>S0402 - The Lion and the Rose<br></h2><p>The first prophetic vision is divided thanks to <b>[1]</b> clips featuring the Weirwood Heart Tree with the sun behind them going from dawn to dusk, which is an allegory for\u00a0\u201ctime travelling\u201d through the Weirwood Network and <b>[2]</b> a black fade-out and a white flash-in, followed by a drum-like sound effect. In broad strokes, the resulting subsets represent what Bran is going to be looking at each season from that point forth. I\u2019ve analysed this one in detail in another post a long time ago (<a href=\"http://une-nuit-pour-se-souvenir.tumblr.com/post/181453355830/brans-vision-cluster-1-got-s04e02\">can be found here</a>), so I\u2019ll only post the conclusions.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/587648df956033a4e7c884983a8ff163/tumblr_inline_pppmaeTYXv1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\"></figure><p><b>First \u201cLine\u201d:</b></p><p>The sun is slight to the left of the Weirwood, representing the recent past to the present. It\u2019s followed by tree roots and the Three-Eyed Raven, representing the Three-Eyed Raven and his ability to \u201ctime travel\u201d through the Weirwood Network. The drum-like sound effect separates that from a segment featuring Eddard Stark sharpening ice and watching fire flare while a captive in King\u2019s Landing, representing Ned\u2019s story during Robert\u2019s Rebellion where he fought against the Targaryans for the sake of his sister Lyanna Stark (sharpening ice), witnessed the birth of Jon Snow (fire reflected in his eyes), and promised his sister that he\u2019d protect him (captivity).</p><p><b>Second \u201cLine\u201d:</b> The sun going all the way to the extreme left of the Weirwood, representing the distant past. It\u2019s followed by the Three-Eyed Raven prancing on a tree, then four clips relating to the Army of the Dead. The first and last are from when Sam slew the White Walker who had come to take Little Sam so he could be taken and transformed into another White Walker, what they flank is the first appearance of a wight, therefore this represents the creation of the Night King and the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead.</p><p><b>Third \u201cLine\u201d:</b> The sun going back to slight to the left of the Weirwood and the centre, representing the recent past to the present, then at the very end going to the extreme right, representing the future. It\u2019s followed by the Army of the Dead\u2019s invasion and a metaphorical representation of Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The drum-like sound effect separates that from a segment with prophetic visions, the Night King seen through a wall of ice and a dragon flying over King\u2019s Landing, interspersed with clips of a raven and Bran falling of the Broken Tower of Winterfell, which represent the future fight against both the forces of ice (Night King and the Army of the Dead) and fire (Danerys and the dragons).<br></p><p>The frozen wasteland with the sun hanging low on the horizon, representing the Long Night or the weirwood roots in the third line, representing going into the past, don\u2019t really matter where they belong exactly since both clips could fit into either previous or following line equally. The <b>Long Night</b> is relevant to both the first Long Night when the Night King and the Army of the Dead were created (the story told in the second\u00a0\u201cline\u201d) and the second Long Night since Jon\u2019s parentage is going to be relevant (the story told in the \u201dfirst line\u201d). Likewise, the <b>weirwood roots</b> which represent \u201ctime travelling\u201d as the Three-Eyed Raven is relevant to both Bran checking out the Night King and the Army of the Dead were created (the story told in the second \u201cline\u201d) and Bran checking out the Army of the Dead\u2019s invasion and Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne (the story told in the third \u201cline\u201d).</p><h2>S06E06 - Blood of My Blood <br></h2><p>The second prophetic vision is divided thanks to <b>[1]</b> the transitions between Bran tripping out and the present as well as <b>[2]</b> the thematic which can be divided into either fire or ice. In broad strokes, the resulting three subsets represent the war against both ice (Night King and the Army of the Dead) and fire (Danerys and the dragons).</p><p>This is allusive to this franchise\u2019s title, <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, a poem by Robert Frost that characterises both fire and ice as equally destructive forces that threaten humanity. Therefore, <b>#1</b> represents these destructive forces of ice and fire as equals, <b>#2</b> represents the conflict against fire and <b>#3</b> represents the conflict against ice. In specific, #3 is the most difficult to get since it contains a \u201cfire\u201d segment and the \u201cice\u201d segment interwoven with the present. I\u2019ll justify why I divided them this way later. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"557\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f45b006d73c8fb9e185b7852f907433c/tumblr_inline_pppn0wfHIN1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"557\"></figure><h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAN STARK<b><br></b></h2><p>Something that is in common with both prophetic visions is the clips featuring Bran falling off the Burned Tower of Winterfell, the raven prancing around, the weirwood tree roots, and the frozen wasteland with the sun hanging low.</p><p><b>THE LONG NIGHT</b><br></p><p><b>[A]</b> The frozen wasteland, with really busy clouds in the sky and the sunrise with the sun hanging really, matches what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXxRcXHI_tI\">the sun\u2019s trajectory</a> looks closer to the northern or southern pole during winter. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_path\">It\u2019s a bizarre notion for the majority of people since they live far away from it, but that\u2019s exactly how it goes.</a> This is meant as an allegory for the Long Night, since extreme winter has come.

I\u2019m not sure if that missing dragon over KIng\u2019s Landing is an encoding error or on purpose, but if it\u2019s on purpose than it symbolises that Aerys didn\u2019t manage to burn it but that Danerys will definitely burn it. Furthermore, Danerys with Drogon over her shoulder has the dothraki kneeling in the background, which suggests that her reasons for burning King\u2019s Landing is to force the Seven Kingdoms to kneel too and recognise her as their queen.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3852\" data-orig-height=\"2872\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a52d9e44864c15ace51683f050e3e11f/tumblr_inline_ppomp46AK71rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3852\" data-orig-height=\"2872\"></figure><p>There is plenty of foreshadowing that Danerys will burn King\u2019s Landing, which I enclose two major examples.

In the show, the scene where Danerys enters the House of Undying in <i>S02E10 - Valar Morghulis</i>, is preceded by Robb marrying Talisa which is what triggered the Red Wedding, furthermore the scenes of Danerys\u2019 invasion of Yunkai in <i>S03E09 - The Rains of Castamere</i>, are interwoven with the Red Wedding proper. In the books, Danerys sees the Red Wedding in one of the House of Undying visions as well.</p><p><b> </b>This recurrence of the Red Wedding in prophetic visions suggests that some thing similar will happen in the future. <b>In it\u2019s essence, the Red Wedding is about person A breaking oaths for love to person B, then that person B seeking excessive retribution since they\u2019re dangerous and vindictive, person B murdering person A and all their retinue by breaking guest-right, and person B usurping person A of their lands and titles.</b></p><p>In the books, there is the foreshadowing of what this might mean since one of the fake people that Danerys finds invites her to share food, which means guest-right. In broad-strokes, Danerys enters a room through a double-door which resembles the House of Black and White which is an assassin guild who disguise themselves as other people to carry out their assassination attempts. This foreshadows that whoever Danerys finds inside represents real people whose intentions will be concealed but whose objective are the dragons, and that they will be responsible for her demise.</p><p>In two posts back, I\u2019ve exhaustively analysed what House of Undying chapter in the books might mean. In specific, I theorised that the kingly man represents Jon Snow inviting Danerys to Winterfell (sharing food = guest-right) to fight the Army of the Dead, since he fits all the requirements (the others are the other Starks and Theon Greyjoy) and that Danerys is \u201cWalder Frey\u201d because she\u2019s a dangerous and vindictive person just like him. Moreover, I\u2019ve also theorised that a further vision represents Danerys outing herself as Azor Ahai and proving herself not the hero that people should cheer for, by burning Winterfell. Since Danerys would be under guest-right, burning Winterfell would break it.<br></p><p>This analysis fits with the way Bran\u2019s second vision is structured. The clip of the Red Wedding follows the Long Night clip, which suggests this Red Wedding V2 will happen ETA: <strike>during</strike> after the Long Night, and Jon convinced Danerys to march North so she\u2019d fight the Army of the Dead. The clip is followed by the negative association between Danerys and the Night King, which suggests that she\u2019s the fire counterpart to the Army of the Dead (aka Azor Ahai and R\u2019hllor versus Great Other), and burning Winterfell or King\u2019s Landing would be that.</p><p>As a side-note, it\u2019s Catelyn Tully that is being assassinated, which suggests a major character associated with Cat would die as a result (it\u2019s \u201cdie\u201d lol, don\u2019t fret). There are some good theories that Sansa Stark, which the show loves to visually make as Cat v2, will be kidnapped from Winterfell before it burns and yet be mistaken for dead for some time in the aftermath. In the show, there\u2019s a surprising number of foreshadowing for this, I\u2019ve read several metas that talk about it. In the books, there\u2019s foreshadowing for this as well:</p><ul><li><b>AGOT #50 Arya #4:</b> Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She\u2019d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who\u2019d been no bigger than Rickon was now. (\u2026) \u201cThere are worse things than spiders and rats,\u201d he whispered. <b>\u201cThis is where the dead walk.\u201d That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery.</b> Baby Bran had clutched at Arya\u2019s hand. <b>When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs</b>, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb\u2019s leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. <br></li></ul><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"80\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee4c6897504f9cc28f59d89d404c6290/tumblr_inline_ppoj2uTvxa1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"80\"></figure><p><b>What this scene represents is that Danerys will break guest-right and burn Winterfell, outing herself and the dragons as a destructive force equal to the Night King and the Army of the Dead.</b> <br></p><p><b>[D2] EDDARD STARK\u2019S EXECUTION</b><br></p><p>The second of these is <b>Eddard Stark\u2019s execution</b>, which is an event that was alluded to in Bran\u2019s first prophetic vision.

Then it\u2019s \u201cfollowed\u201d in Bran\u2019s second prophetic vision by a third clip where Ned is executed.<br></p><p>However, that segment of Bran\u2019s first prophetic vision was meant to represent Bran as the Tree-Eyed Raven checking out his family\u2019s past. It was (greatly) preceded by the Weirwood Heart Tree above the Three-Eyed Raven cave, with the sun having travelled from the centre of the image to slightly right, which is an allegory for going slightly back in time. It was followed by the raven going down the Winterfell crypts, which is an allegory for looking into the past of his dead family (Ned and Lyanna both)<br></p><p>The first clip represents war and corresponds to Bran\u2019s flashback in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yBz54ql-u0\"><i>S06E02 - Home</i></a>, where Ned is sparring with Benjen (training for battle) with Lyanna showing up and Bran\u2019s first Tower of Joy flashback in <i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5aO_CsqfBAo&amp;t=MTdlMTVlZWI4M2IwOTUzZDIwMDBiMTdkMDIwYzU5YWViZGIzNTU1OSxBcTJ6a2pnUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AX-3Q7IiVLrag5cnroOf8lw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fune-nuit-pour-se-souvenir.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F181453355830%2Fbrans-vision-cluster-1-got-s04e02&amp;m=1\">S06E03 - Oathbreaker</a></i>, where Ned fights against the Kingsguard with the objective of rescuing his sister.

In Bran\u2019s first prophetic vision, it\u2019s about the secret of his real parentage, which Ned witnessed and took to the chopping block, and that Bran saw through the Weirwood Network. In Bran\u2019s second prophetic vision, it\u2019s about Jon being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, since Joffrey Baratheon isn\u2019t that and that boy is even a foil for him (Joffrey is the bastard posing as a prince while Jon is the prince posing as a bastard). Then Joffrey, someone who isn\u2019t the rightful heir to the Iron Throne but pretends that he is, moreover who\u2019s vindictive, represents Danerys because this exactly what is going to happen once she finds out.</p><p>This one is more \u201cfamiliar\u201d in prophetic visions, it represents the <b>Dance of Dragons v2</b>. In the show, it shows up in the House of Undying visions as a grill on the floor, foreshadowing it since this framing was used for Joffrey (!) when he was talking about the Dance of Dragons v1, and the blasted King\u2019s Landing throne room which is covered in snow, foreshadowing since it comes right after Danerys is informed that Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne because of the blue flower on the wall and the Iron Throne covered in snow. In the books, it shows up in the House of Undying as well, in the vision where Rhaegar pretty much says he had another child (\u201dthere must be one more\u201d since \u201cthe dragon has three heads\u201d) and Danerys mistakes him for Viserys, whom she usurped.<br></p><p>\n<b>What this scene represents is that Jon and Danerys will fight in the Dance of Dragons v2 over the Iron Throne, perhaps even despite Jon has abdicated in her favour in hopes of saving his beloved sisters and because Danerys is dangerous and vindictive.</b><br></p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"19260\" data-orig-height=\"3590\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a46bdc9accd2d0b04ec57d13b0752edf/tumblr_inline_ppob74XPeo1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"19260\" data-orig-height=\"3590\"></figure><h2><b>#2 - THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE OF FIRE</b></h2><p>This segment can also be \u201cdivided\u201d by three clips of wildfire exploding.

In the show, this is represented by Danerys passing the torch over the blue flower on the wall at the House of Undying in <i>S02E10 - Valar Morghulis</i>. In the books, this is represented by Danerys seeing the Red Wedding (breaking guest-right) and seeing Drogon taking flight from a smoking tower, as well as Bran as Summer seeing a \u201cdragon\u201d over a smoking Winterfell in the aftermath of the Bolton\u2019s sacking the castle \n(ETA: who knows really, Danerys burned shit during the Battle against \nthe Army of the Dead, though not like I expected it, so this means that this is only for her contribution, she may burn it later, or \nit might be \ndifferent in the books).<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"7704\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ede82c9039125d473dac8e3218029bd4/tumblr_inline_pppthyVL4d1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"7704\" data-orig-height=\"718\"></figure><p><b>What this scene represents is that Danerys will burn Winterfell as a result of the Night King and the Army of the Dead\u2019s invasion.</b> <br></p><p><b>THE NIGHT KING\u2019S OBJECTIVE?</b><br></p><p>There is a single detail about this which is quite important. The clip that follows the Night King converting Craster\u2019s baby into a White Walker, is a clip with a raven murder from when Sam slew a White Walker that was coming after Gilly\u2019s baby (another of Craster\u2019s baby). This thematic allusion cannot be taken lightly, especially because this same reference was made in Bran\u2019s first prophetic vision. There, two clips from that scene (weirwood tree and raven murder) flank the wights from Waymar\u2019s Royce expedition beyond the Wall.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3600\" data-orig-height=\"807\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/382744ab916463080df1dc6d88099fd8/tumblr_inline_pppssvjYHP1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3600\" data-orig-height=\"807\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/744c1708230ccd85f65c722f989ee7ce/tumblr_inline_ppps1sjXfz1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"180\"></figure><p>This insistence with the Night King and Craster\u2019s babies suggests that the Night King and the Army of the Dead might have come south because of little Sam. Personally, I feel like all this trouble for a baby is a weak story, furthermore doesn\u2019t fit with the duality of ice and fire. It doesn\u2019t explain why the R\u2019hllor religion portrays both fire and ice as enemies to each other, it doesn\u2019t explain why conveniently the Army of the Dead started getting stronger about the same time that Danerys started getting stronger (hatched the dragons), it doesn\u2019t explain with the Night King\u2019s original mission of being created to fight humans who burned trees and the like. In my personal opinion. Night King and the Army of the Dead started getting stronger to counter the dragons getting stronger (so this is all Danerys\u2019 fault), but they\u2019re also looking for Craster\u2019s baby as a side-quest so they can add him to their ranks to destroy Danerys with (ETA: as of 8x3 nobody knows because the writers don\u2019t care about the magic plot).<br></p><h2>BURNING OF KING\u2019S LANDING</h2><p>This segment is mostly a \u201cflashback\u201d to Robert\u2019s Rebellion, but there are a few odd \u201cpresent\u201d events as well, which outs this thing as both showing the past and how these are a representation of the future storyline.

I do know this, I\u2019ve found PLENTY of foreshadowing that Danerys will ally herself with Euron and with Melisandre. Somehow those two should fit here in some way, but again\u2026 no idea.<br></p><p><b>[J1]</b> Jaime kills the pyromancers. The imagery is different from Aerys though, Jaime\u2019s shadow stabs the pyromancer\u2019s <i>shadow</i>, which means Arya\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d will stab a pyromancer\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d. The fact these are about shadows kind of hints it\u2019s about Melisandre and she fits with the one \u201cstashing wildfire pots\u201d imagery very well since she\u2019s obsessed with fire and blood-magic \n (ETA (8x3): no Melisandre, she\u2019s gooone, so either another priest of R\u2019hllor or bust).<br></p><p>In the books, Danerys meets some fake people at the House of Undying, which are meant to represent the Starks. In particular, Arya is dressed in emerald armour which makes her either armed by Gendry and / or \u201cRenly\u2019s ghost\u201d just like Garlan Tyrell at Blackwater. There are some theories that Danerys and Melisandre will burn Gendry for his king\u2019s blood, which would fit into this. Arya as \u201cGendry\u2019s ghost\u201d would take revenge on Gendry\u2019s behalf (he may survive or he may be kissed, it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019d die) against Melisandre as Danerys\u2019 \u201cghost\u201d by slaying her (ETA as of 8x2, Arya was armed by Gendry).<br></p><p><b>[J2]</b> The raven murder which meant the White Walkers coming for little Sam and Leaf creating the Night King. So by the exclusion of parts, this is (most likely) dealing with Euron Greyjoy. ETA: as of 8x3, it \u201cseems\u201d like Leaf meant Arya, so I\u2019ll revise this. Together, these actually fits the foreshadowing that Arya will kill Danerys with Bran\u2019s help.<br></p><p><strike>In the books, Euron fancies himself as becoming a god and he\u2019s trying to do something by using blood-magic, he\u2019s even recreating Danerys\u2019 funeral pyre but on a boat and with water instead. I actually have no idea. Maybe they\u2019ll want to do some blood-magic at the Trident, maybe Euron finds more dragon eggs and Danerys will think of hatching dragons by turning the Trident into a pyre.</strike><br></p><p><b>[J3]</b> Jaime again, drawing his sword against the NIght King.

Since what follows is the pyromancers stashing more wildfire pots, it highly suggests that Danerys leaves to protect the dragons and to save her strength for other fights. In hindsight, this means Danerys chooses to leave because she is the mother of dragons and prioritises being a power-hungry warmonger obsessed with the Iron Throne, over being the mother of people and being a saviour.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"179\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4daca6294db41f986d6c868ea6b77e76/tumblr_inline_pponv4ryXW1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"179\"></figure><h2>THE BATTLE OF WINTERFELL<br></h2><p>The second stanza is about Bran watching the Night King and the Army of the Dead invading, then watches him as he raises the dead.

The fourth is followed by the Army of the Dead calmly marching south. <b><i>It suggests they win the fight.</i></b> (ETA: confirmed in 8x3, the Night King and his pals did win the fight, they were only stopped because Arya ninja\u2019d the Night King)<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"119\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcf138a43ce5e26a4d2adcbdc58f3f5c/tumblr_inline_ppq1m7nE2o1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"119\"></figure><p>The second stanza is actually continued in the fifth stanza.

It foreshadows that the Night King will reach for Bran (ETA: confirmed in 8x3, the Night King was baited into the godswood by Bran).<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"6420\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/60cfb713aef0150e1c387a1fa087f169/tumblr_inline_ppq391hO7N1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"6420\" data-orig-height=\"718\"></figure><h2>THE NIGHT KING\u2019S OBJECTIVE<br></h2><p>The Night King was created by the Children of the Forest, a human captured that they turned into the first White Walker. Their objective was to use these creatures to fight humans, since they had invaded Westeros and were cutting the Weirwood Heart Trees, as well as slaughtering them all. However, their creations soon turned against him, forcing the Children of the Forest and the humans to ally themselves against this threat, somehow they won and the Night King and the Army of the Dead was forced to go back into the Lands of Always Winter where they hid for centuries.</p><p>The alliance between the Children of the Forest and the humans is known as \u201cThe Pact\u201d. Supposedly, the two sides were tired of the bloodshed, but this is hogwash because <b>the humans were winning</b>. Nobody files for peace when winning. However, they did make that alliance against the Night King, so most likely the biggest reason why \u201cThe Pact\u201d was forged was to fight the Night King as a unit. Regardless, both parts agreed that the forest would belong to the Children of the Forest while the open lands would belong to the humans, plus that the latter would never cut down a weirwood ever again.</p><p>The way the show depicts this pact is similar to the way the Night King grabs Bran\u2019s arm, just in the latter case it\u2019s meant as a \u201cbroken\u201d pact of sorts. This shouldn\u2019t be a coincidence, otherwise, the Night King would just grab him anywhere else. Supposedly, the Night King touching Bran has branded him and that from now on, the Night King knows where Bran is and he\u2019ll come looking for him. Benjen Stark also implies this, that the Night King will come for Bran. Either way, neither speaks in a threatening manner.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fee92e553e18ddf52085f779882e648/tumblr_inline_ppq3u5tp8g1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"360\"></figure><p>This suggests two things. The Night King and the Army of the Dead is attacking because \u201cThe Pact\u201d was broken as well as because the dragons were brought back to Westeros (Aerys saying \u201d<i>burn them all</i>\u201d). The latter makes a lot of sense since fire is a destructive force after all, it would burn a lot of trees so of course that as their elemental counterparts they\u2019d wish to delete them from existence (magic breeds magic in <i>ASOIAF</i>, it\u2019s specifically said that Danerys\u2019 dragons enhanced magic). The second is that Bran will have to make forge a new pact for peace (ETA: confirmed and not confirmed in 8x3, the Night King came for Bran was true but there was nothing else from the winter lore, since D&amp;D don\u2019t give a damn about the magic plot <strike>can you tell I\u2019m angry, my boy Bran and Jon were both robbed, ROBBED, at least the silver lining is that it was a Stark of Winterfell who did the deed</strike>).<br></p></p>",

In broad strokes, the resulting subsets represent what Bran is going to be looking at each season from that point forth.

The drum-like sound effect separates that from a segment featuring Eddard Stark sharpening ice and watching fire flare while a captive in King&rsquo;s Landing, representing Ned&rsquo;s story during Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion where he fought against the Targaryans for the sake of his sister Lyanna Stark (sharpening ice), witnessed the birth of Jon Snow (fire reflected in his eyes), and promised his sister that he&rsquo;d protect him (captivity).</p><p><b>Second &ldquo;Line&rdquo;:</b> The sun going all the way to the extreme left of the Weirwood, representing the distant past. It&rsquo;s followed by the Three-Eyed Raven prancing on a tree, then four clips relating to the Army of the Dead. The first and last are from when Sam slew the White Walker who had come to take Little Sam so he could be taken and transformed into another White Walker, what they flank is the first appearance of a wight, therefore this represents the creation of the Night King and the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead.</p><p><b>Third &ldquo;Line&rdquo;:</b> The sun going back to slight to the left of the Weirwood and the centre, representing the recent past to the present, then at the very end going to the extreme right, representing the future. It&rsquo;s followed by the Army of the Dead&rsquo;s invasion and a metaphorical representation of Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The drum-like sound effect separates that from a segment with prophetic visions, the Night King seen through a wall of ice and a dragon flying over King&rsquo;s Landing, interspersed with clips of a raven and Bran falling of the Broken Tower of Winterfell, which represent the future fight against both the forces of ice (Night King and the Army of the Dead) and fire (Danerys and the dragons).<br /></p><p>The frozen wasteland with the sun hanging low on the horizon, representing the Long Night or the weirwood roots in the third line, representing going into the past, don&rsquo;t really matter where they belong exactly since both clips could fit into either previous or following line equally.

Likewise, the <b>weirwood roots</b> which represent &ldquo;time travelling&rdquo; as the Three-Eyed Raven is relevant to both Bran checking out the Night King and the Army of the Dead were created (the story told in the second &ldquo;line&rdquo;) and Bran checking out the Army of the Dead&rsquo;s invasion and Jon Snow being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne (the story told in the third &ldquo;line&rdquo;).</p><h2>S06E06 - Blood of My Blood <br /></h2><p>The second prophetic vision is divided thanks to <b>[1]</b> the transitions between Bran tripping out and the present as well as <b>[2]</b> the thematic which can be divided into either fire or ice.

This is repeated SIX TIMES through the whole vision, with Aerys two times and Danerys two times, then the latter is repeated twice in #2 the &ldquo;fire&rdquo; segment of the story.

I&rsquo;m not sure if that missing dragon over KIng&rsquo;s Landing is an encoding error or on purpose, but if it&rsquo;s on purpose than it symbolises that Aerys didn&rsquo;t manage to burn it but that Danerys will definitely burn it. Furthermore, Danerys with Drogon over her shoulder has the dothraki kneeling in the background, which suggests that her reasons for burning King&rsquo;s Landing is to force the Seven Kingdoms to kneel too and recognise her as their queen.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a52d9e44864c15ace51683f050e3e11f/tumblr_inline_ppomp46AK71rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There is plenty of foreshadowing that Danerys will burn King&rsquo;s Landing, which I enclose two major examples.

Somehow, the Song of Ice and Fire should involve the Starks in a more mundane fashion, of betrayals and the like.</p><p><b>[D1] THE RED WEDDING</b><br /></p><p>The first of these is the <b>Red Wedding</b>, which is an event that keeps coming up in prophetic visions. In the show, the scene where Danerys enters the House of Undying in <i>S02E10 - Valar Morghulis</i>, is preceded by Robb marrying Talisa which is what triggered the Red Wedding, furthermore the scenes of Danerys&rsquo; invasion of Yunkai in <i>S03E09 - The Rains of Castamere</i>, are interwoven with the Red Wedding proper. In the books, Danerys sees the Red Wedding in one of the House of Undying visions as well.</p><p><b> </b>This recurrence of the Red Wedding in prophetic visions suggests that some thing similar will happen in the future. <b>In it&rsquo;s essence, the Red Wedding is about person A breaking oaths for love to person B, then that person B seeking excessive retribution since they&rsquo;re dangerous and vindictive, person B murdering person A and all their retinue by breaking guest-right, and person B usurping person A of their lands and titles.</b></p><p>In the books, there is the foreshadowing of what this might mean since one of the fake people that Danerys finds invites her to share food, which means guest-right. In broad-strokes, Danerys enters a room through a double-door which resembles the House of Black and White which is an assassin guild who disguise themselves as other people to carry out their assassination attempts. This foreshadows that whoever Danerys finds inside represents real people whose intentions will be concealed but whose objective are the dragons, and that they will be responsible for her demise.</p><p>In two posts back, I&rsquo;ve exhaustively analysed what House of Undying chapter in the books might mean. In specific, I theorised that the kingly man represents Jon Snow inviting Danerys to Winterfell (sharing food = guest-right) to fight the Army of the Dead, since he fits all the requirements (the others are the other Starks and Theon Greyjoy) and that Danerys is &ldquo;Walder Frey&rdquo; because she&rsquo;s a dangerous and vindictive person just like him. Moreover, I&rsquo;ve also theorised that a further vision represents Danerys outing herself as Azor Ahai and proving herself not the hero that people should cheer for, by burning Winterfell. Since Danerys would be under guest-right, burning Winterfell would break it.<br /></p><p>This analysis fits with the way Bran&rsquo;s second vision is structured. The clip of the Red Wedding follows the Long Night clip, which suggests this Red Wedding V2 will happen ETA: <strike>during</strike> after the Long Night, and Jon convinced Danerys to march North so she&rsquo;d fight the Army of the Dead. The clip is followed by the negative association between Danerys and the Night King, which suggests that she&rsquo;s the fire counterpart to the Army of the Dead (aka Azor Ahai and R&rsquo;hllor versus Great Other), and burning Winterfell or King&rsquo;s Landing would be that.</p><p>As a side-note, it&rsquo;s Catelyn Tully that is being assassinated, which suggests a major character associated with Cat would die as a result (it&rsquo;s &ldquo;die&rdquo; lol, don&rsquo;t fret). There are some good theories that Sansa Stark, which the show loves to visually make as Cat v2, will be kidnapped from Winterfell before it burns and yet be mistaken for dead for some time in the aftermath. In the show, there&rsquo;s a surprising number of foreshadowing for this, I&rsquo;ve read several metas that talk about it. In the books, there&rsquo;s foreshadowing for this as well:</p><ul><li><b>AGOT #50 Arya #4:</b> Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She&rsquo;d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who&rsquo;d been no bigger than Rickon was now. (&hellip;) &ldquo;There are worse things than spiders and rats,&rdquo; he whispered. <b>&ldquo;This is where the dead walk.&rdquo; That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery.</b> Baby Bran had clutched at Arya&rsquo;s hand. <b>When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs</b>, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb&rsquo;s leg, sobbing.

The first clip is Ned sharpening Ice, with which he&rsquo;d end up beheaded with. The second clip is Ned as a prisoner in the dungeons of the Red Keep. Then it&rsquo;s &ldquo;followed&rdquo; in Bran&rsquo;s second prophetic vision by a third clip where Ned is executed.<br /></p><p>However, that segment of Bran&rsquo;s first prophetic vision was meant to represent Bran as the Tree-Eyed Raven checking out his family&rsquo;s past. It was (greatly) preceded by the Weirwood Heart Tree above the Three-Eyed Raven cave, with the sun having travelled from the centre of the image to slightly right, which is an allegory for going slightly back in time. It was followed by the raven going down the Winterfell crypts, which is an allegory for looking into the past of his dead family (Ned and Lyanna both)<br /></p><p>The first clip represents war and corresponds to Bran&rsquo;s flashback in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yBz54ql-u0\"><i>S06E02 - Home</i></a>, where Ned is sparring with Benjen (training for battle) with Lyanna showing up and Bran&rsquo;s first Tower of Joy flashback in <i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5aO_CsqfBAo&amp;t=MTdlMTVlZWI4M2IwOTUzZDIwMDBiMTdkMDIwYzU5YWViZGIzNTU1OSxBcTJ6a2pnUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AX-3Q7IiVLrag5cnroOf8lw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fune-nuit-pour-se-souvenir.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F181453355830%2Fbrans-vision-cluster-1-got-s04e02&amp;m=1\">S06E03 - Oathbreaker</a></i>, where Ned fights against the Kingsguard with the objective of rescuing his sister.

In Bran&rsquo;s first prophetic vision, it&rsquo;s about the secret of his real parentage, which Ned witnessed and took to the chopping block, and that Bran saw through the Weirwood Network. In Bran&rsquo;s second prophetic vision, it&rsquo;s about Jon being the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, since Joffrey Baratheon isn&rsquo;t that and that boy is even a foil for him (Joffrey is the bastard posing as a prince while Jon is the prince posing as a bastard). Then Joffrey, someone who isn&rsquo;t the rightful heir to the Iron Throne but pretends that he is, moreover who&rsquo;s vindictive, represents Danerys because this exactly what is going to happen once she finds out.</p><p>This one is more &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; in prophetic visions, it represents the <b>Dance of Dragons v2</b>. In the show, it shows up in the House of Undying visions as a grill on the floor, foreshadowing it since this framing was used for Joffrey (!) when he was talking about the Dance of Dragons v1, and the blasted King&rsquo;s Landing throne room which is covered in snow, foreshadowing since it comes right after Danerys is informed that Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne because of the blue flower on the wall and the Iron Throne covered in snow. In the books, it shows up in the House of Undying as well, in the vision where Rhaegar pretty much says he had another child (&rdquo;there must be one more&rdquo; since &ldquo;the dragon has three heads&rdquo;) and Danerys mistakes him for Viserys, whom she usurped.<br /></p><p>\n<b>What this scene represents is that Jon and Danerys will fight in the Dance of Dragons v2 over the Iron Throne, perhaps even despite Jon has abdicated in her favour in hopes of saving his beloved sisters and because Danerys is dangerous and vindictive.</b><br /></p><hr /><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a46bdc9accd2d0b04ec57d13b0752edf/tumblr_inline_ppob74XPeo1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>#2 - THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE OF FIRE</b></h2><p>This segment can also be &ldquo;divided&rdquo; by three clips of wildfire exploding.

It doesn&rsquo;t explain why the R&rsquo;hllor religion portrays both fire and ice as enemies to each other, it doesn&rsquo;t explain why conveniently the Army of the Dead started getting stronger about the same time that Danerys started getting stronger (hatched the dragons), it doesn&rsquo;t explain with the Night King&rsquo;s original mission of being created to fight humans who burned trees and the like. In my personal opinion. Night King and the Army of the Dead started getting stronger to counter the dragons getting stronger (so this is all Danerys&rsquo; fault), but they&rsquo;re also looking for Craster&rsquo;s baby as a side-quest so they can add him to their ranks to destroy Danerys with (ETA: as of 8x3 nobody knows because the writers don&rsquo;t care about the magic plot).<br /></p><h2>BURNING OF KING&rsquo;S LANDING</h2><p>This segment is mostly a &ldquo;flashback&rdquo; to Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, but there are a few odd &ldquo;present&rdquo; events as well, which outs this thing as both showing the past and how these are a representation of the future storyline.

Somehow those two should fit here in some way, but again&hellip; no idea.<br /></p><p><b>[J1]</b> Jaime kills the pyromancers. The imagery is different from Aerys though, Jaime&rsquo;s shadow stabs the pyromancer&rsquo;s <i>shadow</i>, which means Arya&rsquo;s &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; will stab a pyromancer&rsquo;s &ldquo;shadow&rdquo;. The fact these are about shadows kind of hints it&rsquo;s about Melisandre and she fits with the one &ldquo;stashing wildfire pots&rdquo; imagery very well since she&rsquo;s obsessed with fire and blood-magic \n (ETA (8x3): no Melisandre, she&rsquo;s gooone, so either another priest of R&rsquo;hllor or bust).<br /></p><p>In the books, Danerys meets some fake people at the House of Undying, which are meant to represent the Starks. In particular, Arya is dressed in emerald armour which makes her either armed by Gendry and / or &ldquo;Renly&rsquo;s ghost&rdquo; just like Garlan Tyrell at Blackwater. There are some theories that Danerys and Melisandre will burn Gendry for his king&rsquo;s blood, which would fit into this. Arya as &ldquo;Gendry&rsquo;s ghost&rdquo; would take revenge on Gendry&rsquo;s behalf (he may survive or he may be kissed, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that he&rsquo;d die) against Melisandre as Danerys&rsquo; &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; by slaying her (ETA as of 8x2, Arya was armed by Gendry).<br /></p><p><b>[J2]</b> The raven murder which meant the White Walkers coming for little Sam and Leaf creating the Night King. So by the exclusion of parts, this is (most likely) dealing with Euron Greyjoy. ETA: as of 8x3, it &ldquo;seems&rdquo; like Leaf meant Arya, so I&rsquo;ll revise this. Together, these actually fits the foreshadowing that Arya will kill Danerys with Bran&rsquo;s help.<br /></p><p><strike>In the books, Euron fancies himself as becoming a god and he&rsquo;s trying to do something by using blood-magic, he&rsquo;s even recreating Danerys&rsquo; funeral pyre but on a boat and with water instead. I actually have no idea. Maybe they&rsquo;ll want to do some blood-magic at the Trident, maybe Euron finds more dragon eggs and Danerys will think of hatching dragons by turning the Trident into a pyre.</strike><br /></p><p><b>[J3]</b> Jaime again, drawing his sword against the NIght King.

Since what follows is the pyromancers stashing more wildfire pots, it highly suggests that Danerys leaves to protect the dragons and to save her strength for other fights.

Their objective was to use these creatures to fight humans, since they had invaded Westeros and were cutting the Weirwood Heart Trees, as well as slaughtering them all. However, their creations soon turned against him, forcing the Children of the Forest and the humans to ally themselves against this threat, somehow they won and the Night King and the Army of the Dead was forced to go back into the Lands of Always Winter where they hid for centuries.</p><p>The alliance between the Children of the Forest and the humans is known as &ldquo;The Pact&rdquo;. Supposedly, the two sides were tired of the bloodshed, but this is hogwash because <b>the humans were winning</b>. Nobody files for peace when winning. However, they did make that alliance against the Night King, so most likely the biggest reason why &ldquo;The Pact&rdquo; was forged was to fight the Night King as a unit. Regardless, both parts agreed that the forest would belong to the Children of the Forest while the open lands would belong to the humans, plus that the latter would never cut down a weirwood ever again.</p><p>The way the show depicts this pact is similar to the way the Night King grabs Bran&rsquo;s arm, just in the latter case it&rsquo;s meant as a &ldquo;broken&rdquo; pact of sorts. This shouldn&rsquo;t be a coincidence, otherwise, the Night King would just grab him anywhere else. Supposedly, the Night King touching Bran has branded him and that from now on, the Night King knows where Bran is and he&rsquo;ll come looking for him. Benjen Stark also implies this, that the Night King will come for Bran. Either way, neither speaks in a threatening manner.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fee92e553e18ddf52085f779882e648/tumblr_inline_ppq3u5tp8g1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This suggests two things. The Night King and the Army of the Dead is attacking because &ldquo;The Pact&rdquo; was broken as well as because the dragons were brought back to Westeros (Aerys saying &rdquo;<i>burn them all</i>&rdquo;). The latter makes a lot of sense since fire is a destructive force after all, it would burn a lot of trees so of course that as their elemental counterparts they&rsquo;d wish to delete them from existence (magic breeds magic in <i>ASOIAF</i>, it&rsquo;s specifically said that Danerys&rsquo; dragons enhanced magic). The second is that Bran will have to make forge a new pact for peace (ETA: confirmed and not confirmed in 8x3, the Night King came for Bran was true but there was nothing else from the winter lore, since D&amp;D don&rsquo;t give a damn about the magic plot <strike>can you tell I&rsquo;m angry, my boy Bran and Jon were both robbed, ROBBED, at least the silver lining is that it was a Stark of Winterfell who did the deed</strike>).<br /></p></p>",

Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/43598738\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Bran tried\nto move his muscles in a reassuring smile. He had buried his feelings so deep,\nthat he could not have said, if he smiled really. Theon\u2019s eyes were wide, but\nhe tried to have a grip on his nerves. His bow was ready.</p><p>\u201cShoot,\nwhen I tell you to, not before.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>He closed\nhis eyes again or his eyes were closed. He didn\u2019t know. He could feel the\nchildrens\u2019 excitement. <i>The dragons will\ndie, I promise.</i> Some of their excitement ebbed away.</p><p>Bran briefly\nchecked on Sansa. <b><i>She was on her way out of the crypts, Olyvar and Ghost by her side. She\nwould know what to do. She had survived Littlefinger</i></b>. Bran did not dare\nto check on Arya. Time was getting short.</p><p>The dragons\ncircled the sky. It was strange to watch them. They had an undeniable beauty.\nThe silver light of dawn was painting patterns on their scales, and Bran\nwondered if the would ever see a wondrous sight like that again. </p><p>Winterfell\u2019s\ntowers went up in huge explosions. Bran could see the green light even through\nhis closed lids. A huge curtain of light appeared in the sky or maybe he just felt\nit in his mind. He sensed the White Walkers being pulled behind that curtain.\nThe voices of the children shouted in triumph. Then Bran heard the shrieks of\nRhaegal, and so strong was his connection that it was as if he himself fell. He\ncould feel how the earth and water magic was set free, the scales swung. The\nchildren bore on his mind heavier than ever before. </p><p>He fled to\nthe dragon, merged with the dragon, relishing in his fire and fearing it. Through\nthe dragon\u2019s eyes he saw Jon. Jon had fallen on the dragon. Rhaegal had turned\nto protect his rider. Bran felt the dragon\u2019s trust and flared it highly. For\nthis it was crucial that Rhaegal trusted them. </p><p><i>Jon! </i>His cousin groaned and picked himself up with\ndifficulty. He had blood on his face and held his hand over his left eyebrow,\nwhere he had been cut deeply. <i>Jon!</i></p><p>Jon half\nwalked half crawled to the dragon\u2019s snout. \u201cBran is that you?\u201d</p><p><i>Yes, Jon, you have to set Rhaegal free, now!\nYou have to do it!</i></p><p>Jon was\nclearly dazed. \u201cSet him free?\u201d</p><p><i>Fire made flesh. Set him free, so that he can\nbe pure fire again.</i></p><p>Bran saw\ntears running down his cousin\u2019s eyes, they mixed with the blood on his face. \u201cYou\nmean I have to kill him? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p><i>No, send him home, set him free. He\u2019ll do it by\nchoice.</i></p><p>Bran could\nfeel that Jon joined him in Rhaegal\u2019s mind. The dragon was in pain, but he trusted.\nHe went all still, as if he knew it was important. </p><p>Bran could\nfeel the children hammering at his mind urging him to hurry, pleading with him\nto just kill the dragon and be done with it. The other dragon was flying fast\nto the weirwood.</p><p>Bran could\nhear his own heavy breathing echoing in his ear even though he was in Rhaegal\u2019s\nmind, but he did not relent. Jon had already begun to remove the earth around\nRhaegal\u2019s fire. The coals of the dragon\u2019s mind burned in a steady beat. Bran\nhelped along and he could feel the dragon\u2019s mind picking up heat. </p><p>\u201cWhat do I\ndo now?\u201d Jon asked loudly. Bran could feel the dragon slipping out of their\ncontrol, but he still trusted. </p><p><i>Show him the way to his light, to his fire, the\nfire behind the curtain of shadow.</i></p><p>Bran felt confusion\nfrom Jon, confusion and hurt. \u201cWhy do I have to do this? Why did you not tell\nme, that this would be necessary?\u201d</p><p><i>Please, just do it. You have been beyond the\nveil, I can\u2019t do this. If we bring just one dragon home beyond the veil, the\nother will follow, eventually. Fire magic has to die, as well as ice magic.</i></p><p>Jon\nunderstood. He embraced the fire in the dragon\u2019s mind, took it into himself and\nthen Bran could feel him no longer. His body had slumped at the head of the\ndragon and Bran was thrown into his own body again. </p><p>Theon shook\nhim and pointed. \u201cThe dragon, the dragon.\u201d The children in his mind were\nscreaming as well. The pressure in his mind was less. In their fear they\nfinally let lose their grip on his mind. The huge black dragon hovered over the\nweirwood. Bran could see Daenerys on his back, her silver hair flowing behind\nher, she was bathed in the eerie light of the wildfire that still burned.</p><p>Bran did\nnot allow himself to smile. It wouldn\u2019t serve to alert them to his real plan.</p><p>\u201cNow,\nTheon, now! Aim true.\u201d</p><p>Theon\u2019s\narrow flew at the same moment that Drogon opened his jaws and bathed the\nweirwood in flames. The children shrieked in horror. </p><p>Theon\u2019s\narrow found the eye of the dragon, made stronger by the destruction of the\nweirwood and the loosening of its magic.</p><p>The dragon\nfaltered. Bran became dizzy with the impact of the scales of the world dancing\nwildly. </p><p>Theon\nloosened another arrow. This one took Drogon in the other eye and he fell. </p><p>Time\nslowed, the world was on the edge of destruction, the voices of the children\nwere raging at him, screaming betrayal, but they became fainter, as the fire\nate up the weirwood. Drogon fell onto the burning tree, but as he touched the\nground, he was pulled. For a brief moment, there was a shadow curtain that\nstood black against the sky, and then the dragon was gone. </p><p>The scales\nstill swung, but their rhythm slowed down. It felt like an eternity. Theon was\nbreathing heavily at his side, as if he had run for miles. He probably felt how\nnarrowly they had evaded the end of the world.</p><p>The scales\ncame to an almost halt, but they were not all balanced. They were tipped just a\ntiny bit. Bran could feel a small spark of fire magic, a tiny spark, a life\nspark. He smiled. <i>Jon is alive!</i></p><p>The\nchildrens\u2019 voices had become very faint, but still they insisted. They wanted\nhim to tread on that tiny spark. But he wasn\u2019t theirs to control. Not any\nlonger. And there was another way.</p><p>\u201cTheon,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cYou still have one arrow?\u201d He stretched out his hand.</p><p>Theon gave\nit to him. </p><p><i>You attuned me to your magic.</i> He knew the children would hear\nhim. <i>You gave me a tool to bring balance.</i></p><p>He took the\narrow and picked up the magic, changing it to the ice magic that was the\nopposite of fire. It flowed into him, as if it had been meant to do that. The\narrow vanished. The scales came to a halt, balanced. </p><p>All of a\nsudden, Bran could feel, he looked at the dawn and sunrays touched his face and\nhe laughed, he laughed. He could feel everything. He could feel his own heart\nbeating, he could feel the breath in his lungs, he could feel the blood pumping\nthrough his veins, everywhere. He pushed himself up, he could feel his legs. <i>He could feel his legs</i>. But they were to\nweak to carry him and he wobbled and fell. His eyes met the blackened ground\nwhere the dragon had fallen on the weirwood, and where Daenerys lay, bundled\nlike a puppet. And then he wept.</p>",

He pushed himself up, he could feel his legs. <i>He could feel his legs</i>. But they were to\nweak to carry him and he wobbled and fell.
