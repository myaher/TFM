Her green eyes darted all over her ice cream looking for a right place to attack. Her mother lifted her child up, perching her on her hip before taking a cup of cookies and cream from Dany. </p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d The slightly frazzled mother said. Yet, despite being tired, she couldn\u2019t help gush about her baby: \u201cThis rascal did so well for her first ballet class so we agreed she could get a treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so wonderful! Well done, little one.\u201d Dany said, tapping the girl on her nose which prompted a shy grin from a pair of vanilla ice cream stained lips.</p><p>Waving at the mother and child as they left through the front door, the little girl now spotting an ice cream moustache and a dollop of ice cream on the very tip of her nose, Dany smiled. She loved her job so very much.</p><p>The high bar tables with their matching pale pink bar stools, dotting the parlour became the choice for young couples on their first dates, sharing a chocolate fudge sundae, blushing when their suspended legs bumped into each other by accident. The picnic benches on the front porch were the self-designated spots for housewives to congregate after their morning runs, taking tiny spoonfuls of low fat frozen yogurt between each titbit of gossip exchanged. The little booths by the bay windows were loved by old married couples reminiscing about the good old days over cups of rum raisin and families with their little children enjoying a banana split after dinner, giving their child the first taste of what could become their all-time favourite snack. She was happy that she could provide the people of this quaint little town, be they young or old, a place to duck away from the heat of summer or the chill of winter. Somewhere they could just have fun, no matter rain or shine. </p><p>The blissful smiles on the faces of her customers savouring her homemade treats were the best rewards she could ever ask for. They made her rash decision to abandon a well-paying job in the big city and return home to chase a childhood dream so worthwhile.</p><p>\u201cOh&hellip; look who it is.\u201d Her best friend said in a singsong voice, nudging her excitedly in the elbow.</p><p>Peeking over the freezer, Dany caught sight of that quiet, scruffy, cute stranger from out of town perusing the ice cream selections for the day. Gasping as her breath caught in her throat and the sensation of a blush surfacing to her cheeks made Dany want to simultaneously run away and self-combust. Which was silly because she was a grown woman who shouldn\u2019t be feeling like this. Like a school girl freaking out at the mere sight of that dreamy boy whom she could only dare to watch from afar because he was always flocked by a gaggle of girls. But this cute stranger was always alone which only made her feel sillier. </p><p>For the past week and a half, he\u2019d been coming by every other day. He always ordered a cone and sat outside on the porch writing in his notebook or strumming his guitar. For days now, she\u2019d only known him as the cute stranger that she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about. She wanted to know every single thing about him, study every brick that constructed his person, but she didn\u2019t know how to approach him without seeming abrupt or too forward. She didn\u2019t even know his name. All she knew about him was that his favourite flavour of ice cream was mint chocolate chip and that he was very pretty. </p><p>Though she hadn\u2019t had the chance to scrutinize him up close, she could tell that that man was beautiful with his soft-spoken demeanour, low husky voice, a grace in which he held his guitar and the confident, assuredness, almost an air of regality in which he carried himself. </p><p>Through her stolen glances his way, she discerned that his eyes were a lovely shade of brown. Perhaps the deepest, warmest brown that she knew she could drown in. He had a defined nose that she wished to nudge and nuzzle with her own. A head of raven ringlets that matched his scruffy bread that her fingers itched to tame and muss up at the same time. Pink lips that looked so soft, so kissable she craved to taste them. And a bum so delectable, she longed to squeeze and sink her nails into. Preferably, outside the confines of his very tight jeans. Although, those jeans did make watching him walk away from the counter so much more pleasurable. </p><p>\u201cWill today be the day you finally talk to him? Instead of just watching his every move from behind this counter?\u201d Missandei giggled.</p><p>With a quick glance over at the handsome man, Dany hastily pulled her friend aside. \u201cShhh!! He could hear you!\u201d </p><p>That reply only tickled Missandei even more. In all the years she\u2019d known Dany, she hadn\u2019t seen cool and collected Daenerys Targaryen behave like this around any member of the opposite sex, ever! Dany was always the one the boys pined after. With her beauty, brains, charming personality, great sense of humour, complete with a sunshine smile as the cherry on top.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that Dany who told her misogynistic, pigheaded colleagues off for taking her credit? Where\u2019s that Dany gone, huh?\u201d</p><p>Pressing a palm to her chest, Dany mumbled under her breath: \u201cShe vacates my body every time he\u2019s near.\u201d </p><p>Just then, the bell on the counter went \u2018ding\u2019 making Dany jump. \u201cI&hellip; I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready yet. Take his order for me please.\u201d She squeaked, jerking her head at the cutie who was now standing at the counter ready to order. </p><p>Patting Dany\u2019s arm as she walked by, Missandei shook her head with a wan smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to keep running away from someone you like, love. One day, you\u2019re going to have to face him if you want to keep him.\u201d </p><p>Dany could feel that beautiful stranger\u2019s curious brown eyes lingering on her now. No doubt curious as to what the two of them were doing huddled together. A shiver marched down her spine, sending\u00a0the hairs on the back of her neck standing at attention. His eyes were like an invisible caress traveling down the line of her back. A very delicious caress. She wondered what the touch of his warm hands would feel like. Taking a shuddering breath, she imagined him knowing her, playing her body like the strings of his guitar. His nimble fingers dancing across her skin, leaving sparks in their wake. The mental image of them curled around each other stark naked, panting, moving as one sent more blood rushing through her veins, up to her head so rapidly, she swore there was steam spouting from her ears.</p><p><i>Deep breaths in and out. Deep calming breaths. Breathe.</i></p><p>She repeated that like a mantra in her head as she fled to the storage room in the back. She could just barely hear Missandei and mister dreamy trading pleasantries outside. Yanking open the freezer door, she was just about to start organizing the stock when she realized that she\u2019d already done it in the morning before they opened for business. Groaning, she released her hold on the handle and the door swung back inwards, closing with a click. Resting her forehead against the freezer, Dany allowed the gentle hum of the generator to fill her ears and the metal under her skin to cool her flush. She hoped it would recede soon. Sighing, she asked herself the same question for the umpteenth time since the day she laid eyes on that eye candy of a man: \u201cWhy does he make me feel this way?\u201d </p>",

Perhaps the deepest, warmest brown that she knew she could drown in. He had a defined nose that she wished to nudge and nuzzle with her own. A head of raven ringlets that matched his scruffy bread that her fingers itched to tame and muss up at the same time. Pink lips that looked so soft, so kissable she craved to taste them. And a bum so delectable, she longed to squeeze and sink her nails into. Preferably, outside the confines of his very tight jeans.

In all the years she\u2019d known Dany, she hadn\u2019t seen cool and collected Daenerys Targaryen behave like this around any member of the opposite sex, ever! Dany was always the one the boys pined after. With her beauty, brains, charming personality, great sense of humour, complete with a sunshine smile as the cherry on top.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that Dany who told her misogynistic, pigheaded colleagues off for taking her credit? Where\u2019s that Dany gone, huh?\u201d</p><p>Pressing a palm to her chest, Dany mumbled under her breath: \u201cShe vacates my body every time he\u2019s near.\u201d </p><p>Just then, the bell on the counter went \u2018ding\u2019 making Dany jump. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready yet. Take his order for me please.\u201d She squeaked, jerking her head at the cutie who was now standing at the counter ready to order. </p><p>Patting Dany\u2019s arm as she walked by, Missandei shook her head with a wan smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to keep running away from someone you like, love. One day, you\u2019re going to have to face him if you want to keep him.\u201d </p><p>Dany could feel that beautiful stranger\u2019s curious brown eyes lingering on her now. No doubt curious as to what the two of them were doing huddled together. A shiver marched down her spine, sending\u00a0the hairs on the back of her neck standing at attention. His eyes were like an invisible caress traveling down the line of her back. A very delicious caress. She wondered what the touch of his warm hands would feel like. Taking a shuddering breath, she imagined him knowing her, playing her body like the strings of his guitar. His nimble fingers dancing across her skin, leaving sparks in their wake. The mental image of them curled around each other stark naked, panting, moving as one sent more blood rushing through her veins, up to her head so rapidly, she swore there was steam spouting from her ears.</p><p><i>Deep breaths in and out. Deep calming breaths. Breathe.</i></p><p>She repeated that like a mantra in her head as she fled to the storage room in the back. She could just barely hear Missandei and mister dreamy trading pleasantries outside. Yanking open the freezer door, she was just about to start organizing the stock when she realized that she\u2019d already done it in the morning before they opened for business. Groaning, she released her hold on the handle and the door swung back inwards, closing with a click. Resting her forehead against the freezer, Dany allowed the gentle hum of the generator to fill her ears and the metal under her skin to cool her flush. She hoped it would recede soon. Sighing, she asked herself the same question for the umpteenth time since the day she laid eyes on that eye candy of a man: \u201cWhy does he make me feel this way?\u201d </p></p>",

Her green eyes darted all over her ice cream looking for a right place to attack. Her mother lifted her child up, perching her on her hip before taking a cup of cookies and cream from Dany. </p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d The slightly frazzled mother said. Yet, despite being tired, she couldn\u2019t help gush about her baby: \u201cThis rascal did so well for her first ballet class so we agreed she could get a treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so wonderful! Well done, little one.\u201d Dany said, tapping the girl on her nose which prompted a shy grin from a pair of vanilla ice cream stained lips.</p><p>Waving at the mother and child as they left through the front door, the little girl now spotting an ice cream moustache and a dollop of ice cream on the very tip of her nose, Dany smiled. She loved her job so very much.</p><p>The high bar tables with their matching pale pink bar stools, dotting the parlour became the choice for young couples on their first dates, sharing a chocolate fudge sundae, blushing when their suspended legs bumped into each other by accident. The picnic benches on the front porch were the self-designated spots for housewives to congregate after their morning runs, taking tiny spoonfuls of low fat frozen yogurt between each titbit of gossip exchanged. The little booths by the bay windows were loved by old married couples reminiscing about the good old days over cups of rum raisin and families with their little children enjoying a banana split after dinner, giving their child the first taste of what could become their all-time favourite snack. She was happy that she could provide the people of this quaint little town, be they young or old, a place to duck away from the heat of summer or the chill of winter. Somewhere they could just have fun, no matter rain or shine. </p><p>The blissful smiles on the faces of her customers savouring her homemade treats were the best rewards she could ever ask for. They made her rash decision to abandon a well-paying job in the big city and return home to chase a childhood dream so worthwhile.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 look who it is.\u201d Her best friend said in a singsong voice, nudging her excitedly in the elbow.</p><p>Peeking over the freezer, Dany caught sight of that quiet, scruffy, cute stranger from out of town perusing the ice cream selections for the day. Gasping as her breath caught in her throat and the sensation of a blush surfacing to her cheeks made Dany want to simultaneously run away and self-combust. Which was silly because she was a grown woman who shouldn\u2019t be feeling like this. Like a school girl freaking out at the mere sight of that dreamy boy whom she could only dare to watch from afar because he was always flocked by a gaggle of girls. But this cute stranger was always alone which only made her feel sillier. </p><p>For the past week and a half, he\u2019d been coming by every other day. He always ordered a cone and sat outside on the porch writing in his notebook or strumming his guitar. For days now, she\u2019d only known him as the cute stranger that she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about. She wanted to know every single thing about him, study every brick that constructed his person, but she didn\u2019t know how to approach him without seeming abrupt or too forward. She didn\u2019t even know his name. All she knew about him was that his favourite flavour of ice cream was mint chocolate chip and that he was very pretty. </p><p>Though she hadn\u2019t had the chance to scrutinize him up close, she could tell that that man was beautiful with his soft-spoken demeanour, low husky voice, a grace in which he held his guitar and the confident, assuredness, almost an air of regality in which he carried himself. </p><p>Through her stolen glances his way, she discerned that his eyes were a lovely shade of brown.

Within the GOT world, cousin/cousin, uncle/niece, aunt/nephew marriages are considered acceptable.  It is only sibling/sibling and parent/child relationships that are considered incestuous and frowned upon.</p>\n\n<p>If none of this helps, then I\u2019m sorry to say, anon, but it might be time for some new friends. \u00a0I\u2019m kidding\u2026 <strike>but not really.</strike></p>",
