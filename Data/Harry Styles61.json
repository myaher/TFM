Honestly yeah, it makes sense to me that Harry would possibly connect with that. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from the artist that also felt relevant: </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1a7110b6fad1b9fdeb19e548ea52c749/tumblr_porqfdcB5D1rru2v0_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how Harry would view this statement in relation to his own work and his persona (which I view as part of his work). </p><p>And finally there&rsquo;s this bit from a rather negative review of her show in the Guardian. The critique makes me eyeroll because it basically makes it like a woman&rsquo;s self-examination of her psyche is boring when I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;ve sat thru a fuck ton of men doing the same thing to cheers. But it struck me: </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/60d724729a4003b2a1318485d7294da3/tumblr_porqfbXYOK1rru2v0_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I mean. Damn. I think about what it could be like to be constantly scrutinized. To be exhausted and still on display. And that&rsquo;s what I see Harry dealing with right now. Of course ymmv, but damn. I don&rsquo;t think this exhibit was chosen at random, ok?</p><p>And just one more thing. Emin works in a variety of media, including neon. I&rsquo;m not certain that this piece was in her show, but there were over 100 pieces and this was made recently enough (in addition to fitting the show&rsquo;s theme) that it very well could&rsquo;ve been. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f643d2d99fd041ad8348ad94ed92d2b/tumblr_porqfcw0BD1rru2v0_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a neon heart that says, &ldquo;my heart is with you always&rdquo; &ndash; your eyes do not deceive you. Her website is currently under construction, so I&rsquo;ll link to the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/tracey-emin\">site</a> where I found the image above. Do I hope that neon was there and that Harry bought it? Yup. Sure do.</p>",

They visited other parts of the island including the red sand beach. Harry took lots of photos, so he was her photographer. She shared some pictures on her Instagram and people tried to guess who she is with. Lots of comments were about Harry, but no one could prove their relationship. </p><p>They went to swim to a waterfall. They had to hike through the woods first, but it was worth it. Darcy read it on a traveller\u2019s blog that this place exists. It was hidden and currently no one was there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful. Now I\u2019m glad I listened to you\u201d Harry told her. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna jump?\u201d she asked peaking at the rocks. </p><p>\u201cOf course, but let\u2019s see how deep the water is first.\u201d he said and started taking off his clothes to his swimming tracks. She took off her shirt and denim shorts too. They both went into the water and Harry swam down to observe the water. It was deep enough for jumping. He climbed out and climbed up the rock. </p><p>She backed away a bit. He jumped with a shout. When he got to the surface he started laughing. </p><p>\u201cThis was so good. You gotta try it!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to, but you have fun!\u201d </p><p>He jumped a few more times and finally tired out. He sat on some stone and grabbed his camera. He started clicking. He started taking photos of her and she noticed.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she whined. </p><p>\u201cPose for me\u201d he shouted. She laughed and started making funny poses. Eventually some really great photos turned out from the silly ones. </p><p>They decided to go back and as usual, they had dinner together but this time in their room. </p><p>In the next few remaining days they went to different beaches and tried different food and drinks. They saw some special animals and locals doing some traditional things like dancing. </p><p>Soon it was time to go home. Harry said that Anne and Robin will be in London when they get back, so he arranged them to meet. </p><p>Darcy was really excited to meet the Styles-Twist family after all. The last day they both sat on a comfy couch cuddled up watching the sun set. </p><p>\u201cThank you for all of this\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure to spend these two weeks with you\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd Harry\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmhm\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being a gentleman\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the normal for me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but not all men are like this\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, people, mostly men made fun of me before I was successful. And the funny thing is it wasn\u2019t always about my work. Sometimes they said shameful things because of my size\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your size?\u201d he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cHarry! I\u2019m not really a supermodel size&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that a problem? You know what I say?<i> If you got beauty, beauty, just raise &lsquo;em up</i></p><p><i>'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top\u201d He sang the last part. And they went on together.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, my mama she told me &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about your size&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She says, &ldquo;Boys like a little more booty to hold at night&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You know I won&rsquo;t be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll</i></p><p><i>So if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re into, then go 'head and move along</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m bringing booty back</i></p><p><i>Go 'head and tell them skinny bitches that</i></p><p><i>No, I&rsquo;m just playing, I know you think you&rsquo;re fat</i></p><p><i>But I&rsquo;m here to tell you&hellip;</i></p><p><i>Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top\u201d</i></p><p>They laughed together when they finished.</p><p>\u201cOh, I love Meghan, we\u2019re good friends\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I know her too\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cOhh, I can\u2019t wait to meet your parents\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey are waiting too. They\u2019re very excited about you\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey knew your parents\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d she jumped up. </p><p>\u201cNot personally, but like 20 years back, most people knew your parents in Britain and they knew about you too\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see\u201d she sat back in his arms. </p><p>They left the hotel early in the morning. The flights were long and they spent most of the time watching movies or reading. From New York to London, Darcy fell asleep on his shoulder. Harry let her sleep there and haven\u2019t noticed when she woke up. She just opened her eyes, but didn\u2019t give any signs of waking up. She could see what\u2019s on Harry\u2019s phone. It was a conversation and it took Darcy a few seconds to find out who he\u2019s texting. \u201cKendall&lt;3\u201d She sighed and finally moved a little. Harry locked the screen immediately and put his phone away. </p><p>They landed in the evening and parted their ways. Harry went back to his flat and Darcy to hers. Two days later they met Anne, Robin and Gemma. They went on a family day together. It was all fun but Gemma had to leave early. Though the two girls set up a date to meet again in the next couple of days for a girls day out. </p><p>As the day passed Harry talked with Robin and with that Anne asked Darcy to get a bit separate to talk in private. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m asking this, but do you know anything about Harry and Kendall? Harry barely says anything to us\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cOh, well I\u2026 uhm\u2026 Harry said they\u2019re not officially dating yet and I saw them texting, but I don\u2019t know much either.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d she smiled and Darcy smiled back. </p><p>\u201cI think you two are gonna get married\u201d Anne said randomly that made Darcy shocked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean not in the near future\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI think Harry\u2019s gonna have girlfriends for a few years on, but when he\u2019s gonna settle a bit, he\u2019s gonna look for a woman who can be his wife. And you are someone who he described me once as a perfect wife\u201d she said looking away thinking back of that conversation he had with Harry a year ago. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, but maybe I\u2019ll get married to someone else\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d she said. Well, that\u2019s not what mother-in-law to-be usually says. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see\u201d Darcy said and closed the topic. She understood why Anne says that but it was a bit weird. </p><p>The day was over and Darcy left them be together. She got back to work the next day and immediately got lost in fabrics and threads. Two days later Harry called him to tell he\u2019s going to LA to meet Kendall again and he doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s gonna stay. It wasn\u2019t the thing that hurt Darcy. What hurt Darcy\u2019s feelings was the fact that Harry barely reached to her in any way in the next two months. Darcy enjoyed life though. She had her job, she stayed in contact with Gemma and Anne too, as well as Robin. They called each other at least once a week. \u00a0And of course she saw all those pictures and articles about them. </p><p>Again, she wasn\u2019t upset about him dating another girl. She was upset, because he almost cut all connections with her. Maybe she was a little bit hurt by the fact that not long ago Harry and her sang\u00a0<i>\u201cYou know I won&rsquo;t be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll\u201d</i> out loud and now he was officially dating and all over a stick figure silicone Barbie doll.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t made more contact than a few texts until March. Darcy arrived home from a busy working day and quickly had a shower and changed into pajamas. She sat down on the couch with a mug of hot cocoa and settled in when someone knocked. She almost jumped. It was really late and she got scared, she ignored the knock until it happened again. </p><p>\u201cDarcy, it\u2019s me!\u201d she heard from outside. Was it? Was it him? She went to the door, opened it and found a Harry Styles. He looked bad. </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked shyly.</p><p>\u201cSure\u201d she let him in. She made them tea and they sat down in the sitting room. </p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019re still in LA\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everybody thinks I\u2019m in LA\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just left, I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore\u201d he looked really sad.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked and was really shocked when Harry started tearing. He started telling all of the story for her to understand from the core. </p><p>\u201cSo you knew it was going to be a media set up, but you agreed, but you started to have feelings for her and she mocked you for that?\u201d she asked after he finished. </p><p>\u201cBasically\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d she said and silence fell upon them. A few minutes later Harry spoke up.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I came here uninvited, I haven\u2019t even talked with you for like two months and now I just showed up at your place begging for pity\u201d he stood up to leave but Darcy stood up too to stop him. She hugged him so tightly. He started crying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this. I don\u2019t deserve you\u201d he said between sobs. </p><p>\u201cShut up, you idiot\u201d she said softly.</p><p>In a half an hour Harry was cuddled up in her arms and she caressed his long hair. </p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but we\u2019ll talk about that later\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I stay for the night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll make the guest room for you\u201d she got out of his grip. She was back a few minutes later. </p><p>\u201cI put towels on the bed if you wanna have a shower\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to bed now, but wake me up if you need something\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She heard him having a quick shower and a little later he made no noise, so she fell asleep too. </p><p>Next day she woke up and smelled several things hopefully coming from the kitchen. She quickly changed clothes and went out. Harry was in the kitchen in her clothes making breakfast. </p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 that\u2019s my t-shirt\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cHey! Good morning!\u201d he turned around to see her. \u201cYeah. Sorry! But I wanted to put on something clean\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it just looks funny\u201d she chuckled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have coffee, pancakes and baked beans, I didn\u2019t know what you wanna eat so I made several options\u201d he said enthusiastically. </p><p>\u201cSo what are your plans?\u201d she asked after they had breakfast.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay here for a few days until I decide what to do? I don\u2019t want to tell anyone where I am. I need to hide for a bit\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you can. I can skip work, I haven\u2019t really had days off since we got back so I can be with you if you want that\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to. Thanks!\u201d</p>",

Darcy read it on a traveller\u2019s blog that this place exists. It was hidden and currently no one was there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful. Now I\u2019m glad I listened to you\u201d Harry told her. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna jump?\u201d she asked peaking at the rocks. </p><p>\u201cOf course, but let\u2019s see how deep the water is first.\u201d he said and started taking off his clothes to his swimming tracks. She took off her shirt and denim shorts too. They both went into the water and Harry swam down to observe the water. It was deep enough for jumping. He climbed out and climbed up the rock. </p><p>She backed away a bit. He jumped with a shout. When he got to the surface he started laughing. </p><p>\u201cThis was so good. You gotta try it!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to, but you have fun!\u201d </p><p>He jumped a few more times and finally tired out. He sat on some stone and grabbed his camera. He started clicking. He started taking photos of her and she noticed.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she whined. </p><p>\u201cPose for me\u201d he shouted. She laughed and started making funny poses. Eventually some really great photos turned out from the silly ones. </p><p>They decided to go back and as usual, they had dinner together but this time in their room. </p><p>In the next few remaining days they went to different beaches and tried different food and drinks. They saw some special animals and locals doing some traditional things like dancing. </p><p>Soon it was time to go home. Harry said that Anne and Robin will be in London when they get back, so he arranged them to meet. </p><p>Darcy was really excited to meet the Styles-Twist family after all. The last day they both sat on a comfy couch cuddled up watching the sun set. </p><p>\u201cThank you for all of this\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure to spend these two weeks with you\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd Harry\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmhm\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being a gentleman\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the normal for me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but not all men are like this\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, people, mostly men made fun of me before I was successful. And the funny thing is it wasn\u2019t always about my work. Sometimes they said shameful things because of my size\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your size?\u201d he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cHarry! I\u2019m not really a supermodel size\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that a problem? You know what I say?<i> If you got beauty, beauty, just raise \u2018em up</i></p><p><i>'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top\u201d He sang the last part. And they went on together.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, my mama she told me \u201cdon\u2019t worry about your size\u201d</i></p><p><i>She says, \u201cBoys like a little more booty to hold at night\u201d</i></p><p><i>You know I won\u2019t be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll</i></p><p><i>So if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, then go 'head and move along</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m bringing booty back</i></p><p><i>Go 'head and tell them skinny bitches that</i></p><p><i>No, I\u2019m just playing, I know you think you\u2019re fat</i></p><p><i>But I\u2019m here to tell you\u2026</i></p><p><i>Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top\u201d</i></p><p>They laughed together when they finished.</p><p>\u201cOh, I love Meghan, we\u2019re good friends\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I know her too\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cOhh, I can\u2019t wait to meet your parents\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey are waiting too. They\u2019re very excited about you\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey knew your parents\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d she jumped up. </p><p>\u201cNot personally, but like 20 years back, most people knew your parents in Britain and they knew about you too\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see\u201d she sat back in his arms. </p><p>They left the hotel early in the morning. The flights were long and they spent most of the time watching movies or reading. From New York to London, Darcy fell asleep on his shoulder. Harry let her sleep there and haven\u2019t noticed when she woke up. She just opened her eyes, but didn\u2019t give any signs of waking up. She could see what\u2019s on Harry\u2019s phone. It was a conversation and it took Darcy a few seconds to find out who he\u2019s texting. \u201cKendall&lt;3\u201d She sighed and finally moved a little. Harry locked the screen immediately and put his phone away. </p><p>They landed in the evening and parted their ways. Harry went back to his flat and Darcy to hers. Two days later they met Anne, Robin and Gemma. They went on a family day together. It was all fun but Gemma had to leave early. Though the two girls set up a date to meet again in the next couple of days for a girls day out. </p><p>As the day passed Harry talked with Robin and with that Anne asked Darcy to get a bit separate to talk in private. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m asking this, but do you know anything about Harry and Kendall? Harry barely says anything to us\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cOh, well I\u2026 uhm\u2026 Harry said they\u2019re not officially dating yet and I saw them texting, but I don\u2019t know much either.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d she smiled and Darcy smiled back. </p><p>\u201cI think you two are gonna get married\u201d Anne said randomly that made Darcy shocked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean not in the near future\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI think Harry\u2019s gonna have girlfriends for a few years on, but when he\u2019s gonna settle a bit, he\u2019s gonna look for a woman who can be his wife. And you are someone who he described me once as a perfect wife\u201d she said looking away thinking back of that conversation he had with Harry a year ago. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, but maybe I\u2019ll get married to someone else\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d she said. Well, that\u2019s not what mother-in-law to-be usually says. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see\u201d Darcy said and closed the topic. She understood why Anne says that but it was a bit weird. </p><p>The day was over and Darcy left them be together. She got back to work the next day and immediately got lost in fabrics and threads. Two days later Harry called him to tell he\u2019s going to LA to meet Kendall again and he doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s gonna stay. It wasn\u2019t the thing that hurt Darcy. What hurt Darcy\u2019s feelings was the fact that Harry barely reached to her in any way in the next two months. Darcy enjoyed life though. She had her job, she stayed in contact with Gemma and Anne too, as well as Robin. They called each other at least once a week. \u00a0And of course she saw all those pictures and articles about them. </p><p>Again, she wasn\u2019t upset about him dating another girl. She was upset, because he almost cut all connections with her. Maybe she was a little bit hurt by the fact that not long ago Harry and her sang\u00a0<i>\u201cYou know I won\u2019t be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll\u201d</i> out loud and now he was officially dating and all over a stick figure silicone Barbie doll.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t made more contact than a few texts until March. Darcy arrived home from a busy working day and quickly had a shower and changed into pajamas. She sat down on the couch with a mug of hot cocoa and settled in when someone knocked. She almost jumped. It was really late and she got scared, she ignored the knock until it happened again. </p><p>\u201cDarcy, it\u2019s me!\u201d she heard from outside. Was it? Was it him? She went to the door, opened it and found a Harry Styles. He looked bad. </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked shyly.</p><p>\u201cSure\u201d she let him in. She made them tea and they sat down in the sitting room. </p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019re still in LA\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everybody thinks I\u2019m in LA\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just left, I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore\u201d he looked really sad.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked and was really shocked when Harry started tearing. He started telling all of the story for her to understand from the core. </p><p>\u201cSo you knew it was going to be a media set up, but you agreed, but you started to have feelings for her and she mocked you for that?\u201d she asked after he finished. </p><p>\u201cBasically\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d she said and silence fell upon them. A few minutes later Harry spoke up.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I came here uninvited, I haven\u2019t even talked with you for like two months and now I just showed up at your place begging for pity\u201d he stood up to leave but Darcy stood up too to stop him. She hugged him so tightly. He started crying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this. I don\u2019t deserve you\u201d he said between sobs. </p><p>\u201cShut up, you idiot\u201d she said softly.</p><p>In a half an hour Harry was cuddled up in her arms and she caressed his long hair. </p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but we\u2019ll talk about that later\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I stay for the night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll make the guest room for you\u201d she got out of his grip. She was back a few minutes later. </p><p>\u201cI put towels on the bed if you wanna have a shower\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to bed now, but wake me up if you need something\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She heard him having a quick shower and a little later he made no noise, so she fell asleep too. </p><p>Next day she woke up and smelled several things hopefully coming from the kitchen. She quickly changed clothes and went out. Harry was in the kitchen in her clothes making breakfast. </p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 that\u2019s my t-shirt\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cHey! Good morning!\u201d he turned around to see her. \u201cYeah. Sorry! But I wanted to put on something clean\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it just looks funny\u201d she chuckled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have coffee, pancakes and baked beans, I didn\u2019t know what you wanna eat so I made several options\u201d he said enthusiastically. </p><p>\u201cSo what are your plans?\u201d she asked after they had breakfast.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay here for a few days until I decide what to do? I don\u2019t want to tell anyone where I am. I need to hide for a bit\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you can. I can skip work, I haven\u2019t really had days off since we got back so I can be with you if you want that\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to. Thanks!\u201d</p>",

She made them tea and they sat down in the sitting room. </p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019re still in LA\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everybody thinks I\u2019m in LA\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just left, I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore\u201d he looked really sad.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked and was really shocked when Harry started tearing. He started telling all of the story for her to understand from the core. </p><p>\u201cSo you knew it was going to be a media set up, but you agreed, but you started to have feelings for her and she mocked you for that?\u201d she asked after he finished. </p><p>\u201cBasically\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d she said and silence fell upon them. A few minutes later Harry spoke up.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I came here uninvited, I haven\u2019t even talked with you for like two months and now I just showed up at your place begging for pity\u201d he stood up to leave but Darcy stood up too to stop him. She hugged him so tightly. He started crying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this. I don\u2019t deserve you\u201d he said between sobs. </p><p>\u201cShut up, you idiot\u201d she said softly.</p><p>In a half an hour Harry was cuddled up in her arms and she caressed his long hair. </p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but we\u2019ll talk about that later\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I stay for the night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll make the guest room for you\u201d she got out of his grip. She was back a few minutes later. </p><p>\u201cI put towels on the bed if you wanna have a shower\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to bed now, but wake me up if you need something\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She heard him having a quick shower and a little later he made no noise, so she fell asleep too. </p><p>Next day she woke up and smelled several things hopefully coming from the kitchen. She quickly changed clothes and went out. Harry was in the kitchen in her clothes making breakfast. </p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 that\u2019s my t-shirt\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cHey! Good morning!\u201d he turned around to see her. \u201cYeah. Sorry! But I wanted to put on something clean\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it just looks funny\u201d she chuckled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have coffee, pancakes and baked beans, I didn\u2019t know what you wanna eat so I made several options\u201d he said enthusiastically. </p><p>\u201cSo what are your plans?\u201d she asked after they had breakfast.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay here for a few days until I decide what to do? I don\u2019t want to tell anyone where I am. I need to hide for a bit\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you can. I can skip work, I haven\u2019t really had days off since we got back so I can be with you if you want that\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to. Thanks!\u201d</p>",

They visited other parts of the island including the red sand beach. Harry took lots of photos, so he was her photographer. She shared some pictures on her Instagram and people tried to guess who she is with. Lots of comments were about Harry, but no one could prove their relationship. </p><p>They went to swim to a waterfall. They had to hike through the woods first, but it was worth it. Darcy read it on a traveller&rsquo;s blog that this place exists. It was hidden and currently no one was there.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really beautiful. Now I&rsquo;m glad I listened to you&rdquo; Harry told her. </p><p>&ldquo;You wanna jump?&rdquo; she asked peaking at the rocks. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course, but let&rsquo;s see how deep the water is first.&rdquo; he said and started taking off his clothes to his swimming tracks. She took off her shirt and denim shorts too. They both went into the water and Harry swam down to observe the water. It was deep enough for jumping. He climbed out and climbed up the rock. </p><p>She backed away a bit. He jumped with a shout. When he got to the surface he started laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;This was so good. You gotta try it!&rdquo; he shouted.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to, but you have fun!&rdquo; </p><p>He jumped a few more times and finally tired out. He sat on some stone and grabbed his camera. He started clicking. He started taking photos of her and she noticed.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she whined. </p><p>&ldquo;Pose for me&rdquo; he shouted. She laughed and started making funny poses. Eventually some really great photos turned out from the silly ones. </p><p>They decided to go back and as usual, they had dinner together but this time in their room. </p><p>In the next few remaining days they went to different beaches and tried different food and drinks. They saw some special animals and locals doing some traditional things like dancing. </p><p>Soon it was time to go home. Harry said that Anne and Robin will be in London when they get back, so he arranged them to meet. </p><p>Darcy was really excited to meet the Styles-Twist family after all. The last day they both sat on a comfy couch cuddled up watching the sun set. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for all of this&rdquo; she said. </p><p>&ldquo;It was my pleasure to spend these two weeks with you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And Harry&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmhm&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for being a gentleman&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the normal for me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but not all men are like this&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, people, mostly men made fun of me before I was successful. And the funny thing is it wasn&rsquo;t always about my work. Sometimes they said shameful things because of my size&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with your size?&rdquo; he looked at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! I&rsquo;m not really a supermodel size&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why is that a problem? You know what I say?<i> If you got beauty, beauty, just raise &lsquo;em up</i></p><p><i>'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top&rdquo; He sang the last part. And they went on together.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, my mama she told me &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about your size&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She says, &ldquo;Boys like a little more booty to hold at night&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You know I won&rsquo;t be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll</i></p><p><i>So if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re into, then go 'head and move along</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m bringing booty back</i></p><p><i>Go 'head and tell them skinny bitches that</i></p><p><i>No, I&rsquo;m just playing, I know you think you&rsquo;re fat</i></p><p><i>But I&rsquo;m here to tell you&hellip;</i></p><p><i>Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top&rdquo;</i></p><p>They laughed together when they finished.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I love Meghan, we&rsquo;re good friends&rdquo; she said. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know her too&rdquo; he smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Ohh, I can&rsquo;t wait to meet your parents&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They are waiting too. They&rsquo;re very excited about you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They knew your parents&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; she jumped up. </p><p>&ldquo;Not personally, but like 20 years back, most people knew your parents in Britain and they knew about you too&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I see&rdquo; she sat back in his arms. </p><p>They left the hotel early in the morning. The flights were long and they spent most of the time watching movies or reading. From New York to London, Darcy fell asleep on his shoulder. Harry let her sleep there and haven&rsquo;t noticed when she woke up. She just opened her eyes, but didn&rsquo;t give any signs of waking up. She could see what&rsquo;s on Harry&rsquo;s phone. It was a conversation and it took Darcy a few seconds to find out who he&rsquo;s texting. &ldquo;Kendall&lt;3&rdquo; She sighed and finally moved a little. Harry locked the screen immediately and put his phone away. </p><p>They landed in the evening and parted their ways. Harry went back to his flat and Darcy to hers. Two days later they met Anne, Robin and Gemma. They went on a family day together. It was all fun but Gemma had to leave early. Though the two girls set up a date to meet again in the next couple of days for a girls day out. </p><p>As the day passed Harry talked with Robin and with that Anne asked Darcy to get a bit separate to talk in private. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m asking this, but do you know anything about Harry and Kendall? Harry barely says anything to us&rdquo; Anne said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well I&hellip; uhm&hellip; Harry said they&rsquo;re not officially dating yet and I saw them texting, but I don&rsquo;t know much either.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; she smiled and Darcy smiled back. </p><p>&ldquo;I think you two are gonna get married&rdquo; Anne said randomly that made Darcy shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I mean not in the near future&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;I think Harry&rsquo;s gonna have girlfriends for a few years on, but when he&rsquo;s gonna settle a bit, he&rsquo;s gonna look for a woman who can be his wife. And you are someone who he described me once as a perfect wife&rdquo; she said looking away thinking back of that conversation he had with Harry a year ago. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice, but maybe I&rsquo;ll get married to someone else&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; she said. Well, that&rsquo;s not what mother-in-law to-be usually says. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see&rdquo; Darcy said and closed the topic. She understood why Anne says that but it was a bit weird. </p><p>The day was over and Darcy left them be together. She got back to work the next day and immediately got lost in fabrics and threads. Two days later Harry called him to tell he&rsquo;s going to LA to meet Kendall again and he doesn&rsquo;t know how long he&rsquo;s gonna stay. It wasn&rsquo;t the thing that hurt Darcy. What hurt Darcy&rsquo;s feelings was the fact that Harry barely reached to her in any way in the next two months. Darcy enjoyed life though. She had her job, she stayed in contact with Gemma and Anne too, as well as Robin. They called each other at least once a week. &nbsp;And of course she saw all those pictures and articles about them. </p><p>Again, she wasn&rsquo;t upset about him dating another girl. She was upset, because he almost cut all connections with her. Maybe she was a little bit hurt by the fact that not long ago Harry and her sang&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;You know I won&rsquo;t be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll&rdquo;</i> out loud and now he was officially dating and all over a stick figure silicone Barbie doll.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t made more contact than a few texts until March. Darcy arrived home from a busy working day and quickly had a shower and changed into pajamas. She sat down on the couch with a mug of hot cocoa and settled in when someone knocked. She almost jumped. It was really late and she got scared, she ignored the knock until it happened again. </p><p>&ldquo;Darcy, it&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; she heard from outside. Was it? Was it him? She went to the door, opened it and found a Harry Styles. He looked bad. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; he asked shyly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure&rdquo; she let him in.

Falling into a heap on the sofa in front of her mum,\nbody shaking violently as she sobbed to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know- don\u2019t know why I\u2019m crying.\u201d She let her mum envelope\nher in her arms and rock her back and forth for a few minutes before pulling\naway and wiping at the pools of tears that were getting caught under her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe all have these sorts of days, my love. But things will pick up\ntomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI guess. Nothing has even happened to cause me to feel so, shit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/N had always tried not to swear in front of her mum, and so, her mum was\naware that when she did, she was feeling bad.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSometimes we don\u2019t know why we feel rubbish, we just do. It\u2019s our head\u2019s\nway of telling us we need to reset ourselves. Though let me just as you, are\nyou on your period?\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just asking because I used to\nfeel this way and we both know how similar the both of us are.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not on my period, no.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/M/N nodded before standing up abruptly, confusing Y/N to no end.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to come upstairs with me and sit on your bed while I run you\na hot bubble bath for you. Then, you\u2019re going to sit in there for at least half\nan hour with no phone, no laptop and no other forms of technology-though I will\nput some music on for you-and you\u2019re going to relax. You deserve it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThank you, mummy.\u201d A small smile was shared between the two women before\nY/N followed her mum up the stairs and towards the master bedroom where her mum\ncontinued into the bathroom.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhile I\u2019m doing this, I want you to change out of those pyjamas so you can\nput them back on when you\u2019re out of the bath. They need to go on the radiator\nso they\u2019re warm when you\u2019re out.\u201d Y/N nodded before rummaging through her\ndrawers for her second favourite pair of sleepwear, pulling the pair she was\nwearing from her body and putting them on the radiator in the room before\nputting the new ones on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously, thank you. I know you came over to see me and we were going to\nchat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, sweetie. It\u2019s what mums are for.\u201d Y/N smiled a full\nsmile for the first time that evening, and Y/M/N knew that she would be okay.\n\u201cRight, this is ready for you. I\u2019ll let you put a bath bomb in if you\u2019d like\none but it\u2019s totally up to you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/N held her mum tightly, holding her longer than she normally would, but\nthe feel of having the one woman she truly loved hold her helped more than she\ncould express through words.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs when you come back down. I love you\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI love you too\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/N sank into the hot water that filled the porcelain bath she\u2019d had put\ninto the en suite, her body instantly relaxing into it and her head becoming\ncloudy with nothing.

You deserve it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThank you, mummy.\u201d A small smile was shared between the two women before\nY/N followed her mum up the stairs and towards the master bedroom where her mum\ncontinued into the bathroom.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhile I\u2019m doing this, I want you to change out of those pyjamas so you can\nput them back on when you\u2019re out of the bath. They need to go on the radiator\nso they\u2019re warm when you\u2019re out.\u201d Y/N nodded before rummaging through her\ndrawers for her second favourite pair of sleepwear, pulling the pair she was\nwearing from her body and putting them on the radiator in the room before\nputting the new ones on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously, thank you. I know you came over to see me and we were going to\nchat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, sweetie. It\u2019s what mums are for.\u201d Y/N smiled a full\nsmile for the first time that evening, and Y/M/N knew that she would be okay.\n\u201cRight, this is ready for you. I\u2019ll let you put a bath bomb in if you\u2019d like\none but it\u2019s totally up to you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/N held her mum tightly, holding her longer than she normally would, but\nthe feel of having the one woman she truly loved hold her helped more than she\ncould express through words.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs when you come back down. I love you\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI love you too\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/N sank into the hot water that filled the porcelain bath she\u2019d had put\ninto the en suite, her body instantly relaxing into it and her head becoming\ncloudy with nothing. She took a few deep breaths and chuckled to herself at her\nmum\u2019s choice of spa music; leaning her head against the back of the bath and\nclosing her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The steam from the bath filled Y/N\u2019s nose with each breath in, and the\nstuffy nose she had gained from crying was soon gone, making her feel a little\nbetter instantly. \n\nThough, before she knew it, a few tears were falling down her face once\nmore. \n\nThe more she thought about it, the more she understood why she felt so\nrubbish to start with.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Harry.\u00a0</p><p>She missed Harry.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0They had been friends since they were 16, Y/N being the daughter of a sound\nguy on the X Factor, and they grew close instantly. It was always hard on them\nboth when Harry had to leave for tour, and it affected them both more than\neither would care to admit.\u00a0</p><p>Harry had been gone for 6 weeks, flitting between Japan and LA, not once\ngoing home to London for a few days. His meetings were getting closer together\nand more frequent and causing their bi-daily talks growing infrequent with each\npassing week.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/N missed Harry.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Half an hour had passed before she had chance to register the fact, and so,\nY/N stood up from the water that was starting to lose it\u2019s heat, pulling the plug\nout as she did and stepping onto the fluffy bath mat she had bought herself.\nRather than putting her pyjamas on straight away, she wrapped her dressing gown\naround her body and snuggled into it, climbing onto her bed and resting her\nhead on her pillow for five minutes. She didn\u2019t fall asleep like she normally\nwould.</p><p>No, she stared at the picture at the side of her bed, Harry\u2019s boyish,\ndimpled grin wider than she\u2019d seen it in a while. She stood underneath him with\nthe same smile, her eyes closed in excitement and her hands resting upon\nHarry\u2019s, which rest on her middle.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The photo had been taken on the first show of his solo world tour, them\nboth standing in a random country that she couldn\u2019t remember because all she\ncared about was the man in the picture, his excitement radiating onto everyone\naround them both.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/N was pulled out of her thoughts by a small knock on the door, her mum\u2019s\nhead popping around with a curious smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, I just needed to lay down for a little bit. That bath was lovely,\nthank you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ve ordered a Chinese for dinner. I know you\u2019re eating\nhealthy and whatever now but tonight you need something unhealthy.\u201d Y/N smiled\nas she stood up from the bed, watching her mum mirror her same expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Ever since she was a baby people had told her that she looked like her mum,\nand the older she got, the happier she was that she did. Her mum was in her\nmid-50\u2019s, though looked like she was still in her 30\u2019s. Her mid length brown\nhair never once having been dyed, her eyes still bright and her skin soft and\nalmost wrinkly free. If Y/N looked like her mum when she was her age, she\u2019d be\nhappier than happy.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThank you. How much was it? I\u2019ll transfer you the money into your bank.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNonsense, it\u2019s on me tonight. Anyway, hurry up and get changed, it\u2019ll be\nhere in 10 minutes.\u201d Y/N nodded and waited until her mum had left the room to\npick her phone up and send a quick text.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0To: H \ud83d\udc95\n\nI miss you xx\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0She threw her phone onto her bed as she pulled the black joggers she had\nstolen from Harry onto her body, tying them at the waist so they were sat\nsecurely, and then pulled the merchandise he had given her onto her body,\nignoring the pyjamas that she had been wearing previously. She didn\u2019t think it\nwere possible, but the clothes she wore still somehow smelt of her best friend,\nsomething that instantly picker her mood up.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0She jogged down the stairs and into the living room where her mum sat\nwatching TV with her feet up on the coffee table, phone in her hand texting one\nof her friends.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cFood will only be 5 minutes.\u201d She hadn\u2019t looked up from her phone, and\nwhen she had, she grew confused. \u201cI thought you\u2019d put your pyjamas on the\nradiator?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI miss him\u201d. Y/M/N nodded, understanding why her daughter had been feeling\nso rubbish that day.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIs that why you feel so rubbish do you think? Because you miss, Harry?\u201d\nY/N only nodded, curling into the corner of the sofa with her knees to her\nchest and her head resting on the back of the seat. Her mum rubbed at her legs\nand watched as her daughter took a few deep breaths, pulling her arms around\nher legs and closing her eyes quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The doorbell pulled her from her thoughts of her best friend, her stomach\ninstantly growling at the thought of food. Her mum chuckled before standing up\nand walking to the door, not letting Y/N go even though she tried to insist.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cReally, I\u2019ll go don\u2019t worry\u201d. Y/M/N walked back into the living room with\nthe bag of food, placing it on the coffee table before motioning for her\ndaughter to look at her. \u201cNow, I know you want food but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s\nsomething else you want too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The confusion could be seen through Y/N\u2019s furrowed brows, her eyes blinking\nfor a second longer than they normally would. Though, when the tall, lanky man\nshe loved walked through the doorframe and into the room, she stood up faster\nthan she had all day.</p><p>Harry opened his arms for his best friend to run into, and gripped her\nthighs when she jumped onto him, wrapping her legs around his waist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019ve missed you so fucking much\u201d.\u00a0</p><p><b>Why oh why do I love this so much? The cringe side of Harry being her best friend since they were 16 hasn\u2019t been through my mind in so long that I needed it to happen haha!!\u00a0</b></p>",

The older girl could feel the slight tremor in the servant\u2019s fingers, and she stopped herself from bringing attention to it, from reminding her that as the future heiress, she was almost ubiquitously untouchable. The presence of males never ceased to shock the younger girl, mostly when regarding the heiress\u2019 personal chambers but especially when she was in such an intimate state. To some extent, Sophie understood her skittishness. If the King knew of this, it would certainly not go unpunished, though to what extent, Sophie didn\u2019t care to know. Instead, she let Samantha loosen her corset until it was to Sophie\u2019s satisfaction. She dismissed the girl without so much as a stutter, offering only a vague mention of her impending sleep before watching her maid retreat from her quarters. </p><p>Alone with the two males, Sophie turned her attention back to the mirror, a new prickle of excitement washing over her skin as her eyes found Fionn\u2019s reflection. There was a hot flush on his cheeks that hadn\u2019t been there before, an edge of breathlessness as his eyes flicked over to Harry\u2019s every so often. Had it been anyone else, the Queen, perhaps, the lack of subtlety would have been immediately reprimanded. As it was, Sophie indulged in his discomfort, in the obvious way he lusted over the musician as his bow phrased a deft, languid melody on his violin. It was the first time the three of them had been in a room alone, and though Sophie knew in great details of Harry\u2019s sexual escapades with her personal guard, she doubted Fionn knew anything about her own. This would be interesting.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Sophie\u2019s voice cut through the simmering tension, and immediately the violin stopped.</p><p>\u201cYes, milady.\u201d He was standing straight, hands at his back, but his posture was significantly more relaxed than it had been with Samantha in the room. Sophie would go as far as to call it eager, the way he seemed to gravitate forward on the balls of his feet, waiting.</p><p>\u201cCome sit closer to me. I can hardly hear you from all the way across the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, milady.\u201d</p><p>Sophie had to bite the inside of her cheek at the fish-mouthed look on Fionn\u2019s face as he glanced back and forth between the two, a fearful panic clouding his features at Harry\u2019s proximity to the royal heiress. Harry stopped a few feet away from the heiress\u2019 vanity, mirth radiating from his body as he brought his violin up to his chin.</p><p>It took an incredible amount of effort to not turn her head, to remain stoic when Harry was so close, when he was purposely playing the melody he knew she loved - the one he\u2019d composed for her. She brushed a bristled comb through her hair, wincing at the initial twinge of pain that shot through her tender scalp. The last time he was here, Harry\u2019s hand had twitched over his bow, causing an almost imperceptible hiccup in the melody because he wanted to touch - to soothe. Sophie imagined him doing so now, being gentle as he lowered his violin to the ground before coming up behind her, taking the comb from her hand, and grooming her himself. Her thighs twitched on the hard wood of her chair as her mind conjured up all the delicious turns that scenario could take. </p><p>Harry was slowing down the song, teasing her with every passing stanza even as she refused to pay any attention to him. He knew it wouldn\u2019t be long - they both knew, but this was always so much more fun. The risk, the wait, the game. They were cat and mouse, give and take - and on nights like these, all Sophie wanted was to take, take, take.</p><p>From his post by the door, Fionn refused to relax. Harry\u2019s presence clearly had a visceral effect on him, that was undeniable, but his closeness to the royal heiress was jarring. From Sophie\u2019s small vantage point in the mirror, it almost looked like Fionn was unsure of whether to bend over for Harry or attack him. The thought sparked an involuntary giggle from Sophie\u2019s mouth, and she lifted a hand to her lips, schooling her expression even as Fionn jolted in his boots, startled by the sound. Enough was enough.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Her voice was gentler this time, a touch less commanding as she finally - finally - turned to face the older male. The music had stilled almost preemptively, and even with the dim lighting she could see the mossiness of his eyes when they met hers. \u201cMay you please help me remove my pendant?\u201d She reached up to touch her fingers to the ruby, voice laced with innocent plea. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not very good with my fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, milady.\u201d Setting his violin down against the nearest wall, Harry straightened up and strode up to Sophie\u2019s side, unable to feign submissiveness even with an audience. It might\u2019ve had to do with his past with Fionn, but Harry carried himself with confident poise until he was standing just behind Sophie\u2019s chair, hands twitching at his sides. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>Fionn\u2019s normally inexpressive, dove-grey eyes nearly popped out of their sockets when Harry\u2019s fingers touched Sophie\u2019s neck, and he looked so wound up Sophie feared he might faint if he forgot to breathe for any longer.</p><p>\u201cThere is no need be so tense, Fionn,\u201d She addressed him for the first time that night, wanting to put him out of his internal panic. \u201cYou can relax.

It didn\u2019t matter how many times they\u2019d been alone like this. Truthfully, the number was quite low. Yet, Harry still looked at her like she was his breath of fresh air, a sense of comfort in his warm gaze when they were together like he knew just how safe he was at her side, and her his.</p>",

She watched him for a few seconds longer before blinking to refocus on her own reflection. Her scalp still ached from where her honey-brown hair had been ruthlessly pinned in an arch both precarious and precise. Loose now, it tumbled down her back in sensual waves, the light colour blending almost homogeneously with that of her eyes.

The older girl could feel the slight tremor in the servant\u2019s fingers, and she stopped herself from bringing attention to it, from reminding her that as the future heiress, she was almost ubiquitously untouchable. The presence of males never ceased to shock the younger girl, mostly when regarding the heiress\u2019 personal chambers but especially when she was in such an intimate state. To some extent, Sophie understood her skittishness. If the King knew of this, it would certainly not go unpunished, though to what extent, Sophie didn\u2019t care to know. Instead, she let Samantha loosen her corset until it was to Sophie\u2019s satisfaction. She dismissed the girl without so much as a stutter, offering only a vague mention of her impending sleep before watching her maid retreat from her quarters. </p><p>Alone with the two males, Sophie turned her attention back to the mirror, a new prickle of excitement washing over her skin as her eyes found Fionn\u2019s reflection. There was a hot flush on his cheeks that hadn\u2019t been there before, an edge of breathlessness as his eyes flicked over to Harry\u2019s every so often. Had it been anyone else, the Queen, perhaps, the lack of subtlety would have been immediately reprimanded. As it was, Sophie indulged in his discomfort, in the obvious way he lusted over the musician as his bow phrased a deft, languid melody on his violin. It was the first time the three of them had been in a room alone, and though Sophie knew in great details of Harry\u2019s sexual escapades with her personal guard, she doubted Fionn knew anything about her own. This would be interesting.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Sophie\u2019s voice cut through the simmering tension, and immediately the violin stopped.</p><p>\u201cYes, milady.\u201d He was standing straight, hands at his back, but his posture was significantly more relaxed than it had been with Samantha in the room. Sophie would go as far as to call it eager, the way he seemed to gravitate forward on the balls of his feet, waiting.</p><p>\u201cCome sit closer to me. I can hardly hear you from all the way across the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, milady.\u201d</p><p>Sophie had to bite the inside of her cheek at the fish-mouthed look on Fionn\u2019s face as he glanced back and forth between the two, a fearful panic clouding his features at Harry\u2019s proximity to the royal heiress. Harry stopped a few feet away from the heiress\u2019 vanity, mirth radiating from his body as he brought his violin up to his chin.</p><p>It took an incredible amount of effort to not turn her head, to remain stoic when Harry was so close, when he was purposely playing the melody he knew she loved - the one he\u2019d composed for her. She brushed a bristled comb through her hair, wincing at the initial twinge of pain that shot through her tender scalp. The last time he was here, Harry\u2019s hand had twitched over his bow, causing an almost imperceptible hiccup in the melody because he wanted to touch - to soothe. Sophie imagined him doing so now, being gentle as he lowered his violin to the ground before coming up behind her, taking the comb from her hand, and grooming her himself. Her thighs twitched on the hard wood of her chair as her mind conjured up all the delicious turns that scenario could take. </p><p>Harry was slowing down the song, teasing her with every passing stanza even as she refused to pay any attention to him. He knew it wouldn\u2019t be long - they both knew, but this was always so much more fun. The risk, the wait, the game. They were cat and mouse, give and take - and on nights like these, all Sophie wanted was to take, take, take.</p><p>From his post by the door, Fionn refused to relax. Harry\u2019s presence clearly had a visceral effect on him, that was undeniable, but his closeness to the royal heiress was jarring. From Sophie\u2019s small vantage point in the mirror, it almost looked like Fionn was unsure of whether to bend over for Harry or attack him. The thought sparked an involuntary giggle from Sophie\u2019s mouth, and she lifted a hand to her lips, schooling her expression even as Fionn jolted in his boots, startled by the sound. Enough was enough.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Her voice was gentler this time, a touch less commanding as she finally - finally - turned to face the older male. The music had stilled almost preemptively, and even with the dim lighting she could see the mossiness of his eyes when they met hers. \u201cMay you please help me remove my pendant?\u201d She reached up to touch her fingers to the ruby, voice laced with innocent plea. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not very good with my fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, milady.\u201d Setting his violin down against the nearest wall, Harry straightened up and strode up to Sophie\u2019s side, unable to feign submissiveness even with an audience. It might\u2019ve had to do with his past with Fionn, but Harry carried himself with confident poise until he was standing just behind Sophie\u2019s chair, hands twitching at his sides. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>Fionn\u2019s normally inexpressive, dove-grey eyes nearly popped out of their sockets when Harry\u2019s fingers touched Sophie\u2019s neck, and he looked so wound up Sophie feared he might faint if he forgot to breathe for any longer.</p><p>\u201cThere is no need be so tense, Fionn,\u201d She addressed him for the first time that night, wanting to put him out of his internal panic. \u201cYou can relax. Harry won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicked up to the man standing behind her, finding him looking down at her fondly. It didn\u2019t matter how many times they\u2019d been alone like this. Truthfully, the number was quite low. Yet, Harry still looked at her like she was his breath of fresh air, a sense of comfort in his warm gaze when they were together like he knew just how safe he was at her side, and her his.</p>",

After you guys eat you all make your way into the dining room to talk and watch tv. Harry was sitting on one of the leather chairs just right next to you, and he kept glancing at you every once in a while like he was wanting you to make your way over to him. The sweater he was wearing too was just making him look extra comfy and cuddly.</p><p><br/></p><p>Getting up from your seat taking the blanket with you. As soon as you got off your seat he couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at you the whole time you walked over to him. You slowly walk over to him though still shy around him, and you crawl on his lap.  </p><p><br/></p><p>Wrapping it around each other while he wraps his arm around your waist holding onto you tightly, and he lightly chuckles at how cute and shy you are still with him even after being together for a couple years. He nuzzles his face in your neck and leaves little kisses, but not in a sexual way but just out of habit because he loves kissing you, and it&rsquo;s just to let you know how much he adores you and that he will always be right by your side. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I love you y/n.&rdquo; He whispers in your ear and those three words still make your heart skip a beat. You&rsquo;ll never get over him saying that to you.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Harry.&rdquo; He leans down and gives you a soft and tender kiss. </p><p><br/></p><p>He held you with such protection like he was almost afraid to let you go. Afraid that someone or something was going to rip you from his grasp. Always holding onto you or touching you in some way to make sure you were real, and still really his. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou ready for bed?\u201d He asked when he saw your eyelids drooping more and more. With that question your only response was a yawn making him laugh at you. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOkay I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d He said getting up moving you off of him unfortunately but he immediately grabbed onto you and pulled you with him. </p><p><br/></p><p>The two of you saying your goodbyes to his parents and heading back outside into the chilly air. Practically running over to his car and hopping in letting yourself defrost. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou okay love?\u201d He asked you when he started to pull out of the driveway and heading back onto the street.

After you guys eat you all make your way into the dining room to talk and watch tv. Harry was sitting on one of the leather chairs just right next to you, and he kept glancing at you every once in a while like he was wanting you to make your way over to him. The sweater he was wearing too was just making him look extra comfy and cuddly.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting up from your seat taking the blanket with you. As soon as you got off your seat he couldn\u2019t help but smile at you the whole time you walked over to him. You slowly walk over to him though still shy around him, and you crawl on his lap.  </p><p><br></p><p>Wrapping it around each other while he wraps his arm around your waist holding onto you tightly, and he lightly chuckles at how cute and shy you are still with him even after being together for a couple years. He nuzzles his face in your neck and leaves little kisses, but not in a sexual way but just out of habit because he loves kissing you, and it\u2019s just to let you know how much he adores you and that he will always be right by your side. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI love you y/n.\u201d He whispers in your ear and those three words still make your heart skip a beat. You\u2019ll never get over him saying that to you.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI love you too Harry.\u201d He leans down and gives you a soft and tender kiss. </p><p><br></p><p>He held you with such protection like he was almost afraid to let you go. Afraid that someone or something was going to rip you from his grasp. Always holding onto you or touching you in some way to make sure you were real, and still really his. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou ready for bed?\u201d He asked when he saw your eyelids drooping more and more. With that question your only response was a yawn making him laugh at you. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d He said getting up moving you off of him unfortunately but he immediately grabbed onto you and pulled you with him. </p><p><br></p><p>The two of you saying your goodbyes to his parents and heading back outside into the chilly air. Practically running over to his car and hopping in letting yourself defrost. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou okay love?\u201d He asked you when he started to pull out of the driveway and heading back onto the street. You just looked at him and nodded with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah Harry I just really want to cuddle with you.\u201d You said leaning your head back against the headrest of the seat smiling to yourself. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe can cuddle when we get back home darling.\u201d Grabbing onto your hand and grinning at you showing off his dimples that you loved so much. </p><p><br></p><p>If you could spend your entire life wrapped in his arms you would.

On the outside, they were completely and utterly enamored with each other. </p><p>The press always managed to snag a picture of Harry\u2019s face, melting in adoration every time he looked at Y/N and he definitely used that to his advantage. He managed to create an image of himself; a kind, humble, affectionate gentleman that would do anything for his lady, Y/N. Don\u2019t get this wrong, Harry was the epitome of God in human form. He was everything described, except his affection weren\u2019t only for Y/N. </p><p>There were a couple of women\u2014a lot of them, actually\u2014who surrounded Harry whenever they went out to dinner parties together. Like a predator to prey, to which Harry was, and he let them have their way at him. Of course, he always made sure that Y/N was driven home safely before he hitched a ride with his flavor of the night. </p><p>Like a few days ago, they were out on a movie premiere on a new Nolan movie. Out of respect and an invitation, Harry had spent days planning his statement outfit. He also set out choices for Y/N to pick from as she would be the final touch of his look that night. While he wore a black blazer with gold embellishments, Y/N dressed in a fitting black dress with dandelion lace and gold beads to match his suit. </p><p>The day after the event was met with significant mentions and tags from fans on both their social media accounts. Tabloids and headline articles also stacked on the Google page. <i>\u201cHarry and Y/N: the Golden couple\u201d</i> and various other play on words praised their choice of clothing for the night. It then went on how Harry had placed his hand gently on her mid-waist, pulling Y/N closer to him when a slight mob gathered around them on the red carpet. An action that could only be described as \u2018<i>sweet</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>caring</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>protective</i>\u2019 even made the list. </p><p>The authors went on to flatter both their egos; how perfectly they complemented each other, and not just with the gold and black\u2014but as well as their personalities. Harry and Y/N were public figures, him with singing and her with acting, meaning that everything was out in the open. Criticisms and comments weren\u2019t always the best and the pair had learned to handle the rude fans in the best ways. <i>Treat people with kindness</i>, Harry said. And that they did. </p><p>When she was blazed with anger and frustration when a fan harassed her brother through Twitter, Harry was there to steady her by her shoulders and told her to breathe. Somehow, a video of that went viral and indirectly suggested that they were <i>perfect</i> for each other because they knew one another so well. </p><p>After the first screening of the movie, all the invited guests were ushered in the dining hall. Round tables filled with celebrities and notable people mingled with each other for business, or for just an awkward couple of hours. Y/N and Harry were lucky that Liam was in the same table as them, as well as Shawn, and a woman who had been moved to their table by accident. </p><p>It was lucky\u2014indeed\u2014because Y/N didn\u2019t have to pretend to be okay in front of her good friends as much as she would with strangers. Sitting beside Harry was one thing; his hand lazily lying on her exposed thigh was another. Yet, it all meant that both of them were together. Y/N was happy that he was showing affection, albeit for a show, but it\u2019s been days since he\u2019d even come close to her. </p><p>They lived in the same house, it made headlines, of course. It was nothing special, really. If anything, it was only a place for them to rest a night. None of them really hung around that much individually due to their schedules. \u00a0It was a surprise, however, when Harry started coming home extremely late and he sometimes didn\u2019t even step foot for the night at all. It was the moment when things changed significantly for both of them. </p><p>So when Y/N\u2019s attention shifted from the special thanks speech that the director was giving to the cold breeze caressing the skin where Harry\u2019s palm no longer strayed\u2014she wished that he never even gave her a taste of affection in the first place. Because now, she craved for it more than ever and he single-handedly plucked it out from her reach. Her eyes traced the white of his dress shirt\u2014having taken off his suit jacket\u2014only to find it bent in a sneaky wave to a person a few tables away. And <i>god</i>, she wished that she could go back in time and made up an excuse about not attending the event because then the heartbreak she was feeling right now would be nonexistent. </p><p>It was as if a hammer smashed her heart to pieces, beating down the already cracked organ and dwindling to crumbs with no way to save it. A dull throb pounded within her and she squirmed in her seat when her stomach grumbled in the discomfort of the sight. The sound of people clapping threw her off her destructive thoughts and she mindlessly applauded along with them. And with that, people stood up to go on the dance floor, doubling as a bar. She shook her head in rejection when Liam and Shawn asked her if she wanted to join the lot of them. She would rather stay here with her love. </p><p>Sadly, the feeling wasn\u2019t mutual. As soon as people dispersed and gradually loosened up with drinks in hand, Harry was quick to lean over and whisper to Y/N. She had been sitting there, motionlessly, hoping that maybe her boyfriend would ask her to dance with him. Or just do <i>anything</i> with him; she would gladly do it. </p><p>\u201c<i>Y/N, think \u2018m gonna head off tonight</i>,\u201d His breath hit her neck in warm gusts but the chill the ran through her spine was nothing but. </p><p>Though she was expecting such an action sooner or later throughout the night, a part of her really believed that they would be heading home together hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces from an enjoyable night. Maybe they\u2019d even reconciled with the act of making love\u2014she wore her black lingerie that made Harry <i>not</i> want to keep his hands to himself. That wasn\u2019t the case because as Y/N moved her head to face him directly, his eyes never watched her hurt expression and instead, focused on the woman in the red dress. </p><p>She was beautiful. Her dress made her stand out from the crowd of dark colors and Y/N mentally shamed herself for not wearing something else. The design on her chest made ample of cleavage be visible to the eye and Y/N wondered if that was what caught Harry\u2019s attention. It seemed that both of them were itching to leave the place and do God knows what because the woman barely glanced at Y/N even if she was sitting right beside Harry. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</i></b> Y/N questioned, fully knowing the answer to that. He had done it plenty of times before and there was no use in pretending anymore. </p><p>He finally looked down at her, his eyes darkened in lust and dilated in want\u2014not mentioning the hand that was slowly adjusting the bump in his pants. It wasn\u2019t Y/N, however. <i>\u201cJust some hotel,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWill you be coming home tonight?\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c\u2018<i>M not sure, love,\u201d</i> He answered, twisting his body to grab the jacket that hung on the chair. <i>\u201cI\u2019ll text you to let you know, though.\u201d</i></p><p>He gave her a kiss on the cheek, his soft lips being the last touch she\u2019d receive from him for the night. \u201c<i>Love you,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry didn\u2019t wait for her to respond. Quickly standing on his feet, he walked briskly away from Y/N and towards the exit where the woman had been standing for a bit of time while Harry bid his goodbyes. She greeted him with a nod and kept her distance, knowing full well that they couldn\u2019t be risked being seen touching each other. </p><p>She watched as the pair disappeared through the spinning glass doors, his hand hovering over her mid waist like he did with her. Y/N stayed immobilized in her chair, unable to move anything\u2013not even her eyes. Like she said, Harry had done this so many times before that every move he made was predictable, but somehow it still took her by surprise by how easily he moved to leave her behind for another that gave him something she couldn\u2019t\u2013apparently\u2013satisfy.</p><p>Every time he left was like a pull to her heart and it was getting repetitive to the point that there was nothing <i>to</i> pull and she was just in a constant state of pain that seemed to have no end. There were nights where she stayed up late waiting for him to enter through the front doors, and when he didn\u2019t, the worry ceased to disappear and she had to cry herself to sleep at night to let her eyes go sore enough that she couldn\u2019t keep them open. Right now was no different, except she wished that she was in the comfort of their shared home and shielded from the prying cameras that documented every bit of her life. </p><p>Once she felt the wet drops lingering on her waterline, Y/N knew she had to get out of the venue as soon as possible. </p><p>\u201c<i>Y/N! Are you leaving?\u201d</i> Shawn yelled out, calling after her breathlessly. </p><p>She wiped the tears carefully\u2013not wanting to smudge her makeup and look even more distraught\u2013to her temples and hairline. <b><i>\u201cYeah, I uh have an early morning tomorrow,\u201d</i></b></p><p>He nodded understandingly, walking to his seat to grab his suit jacket as well. <i>\u201cWhere\u2019s Harry? Did he leave?\u201d</i> He looked at her with an intense gaze. </p><p>Shawn was one of the few people who knew about their open relationship, aside from the crew that worked with both of them daily. He didn\u2019t approve of it since he didn\u2019t want to see it <i>\u2018blow up in her face</i>\u2019 in the end. </p><p>\u201c<i><b>Yeah, she left with that lady in the red dress,\u201d</b></i> She pointed at the table, and then laid her chin on her forearms. </p><p><i>\u201cTanya?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Is that her name? Actually, whatever don\u2019t make her a real person to me,</i></b>\u201d Y/N interrupted. <i><b>\u201cMakes me feel less hurt somehow if I, you know, pretend.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Shawn bobbed his head, slipping his arms in the holes of the silk fabric. \u201c<i>Let me take you home,\u201d</i></p><p>Defeated and worn out, Y/N agreed\u2013no way was she in a state to travel alone right now. Shawn and Y/N left the building together, and just like Harry, Shawn\u2019s palm grazed the fabric of her lower back carefully to steady her.</p><p>Y/N was so done with today that she didn\u2019t pay mind to the man and the blinding flash that captured a \u2018<i>provocative</i>\u2019 picture of the both of them. She shrugged it off, knowing that the press will twist the pictures to match their words. </p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>new series! let me know what you thought :D</p><p>\n\npermanent taglist; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\">@kissme-hs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\">@agoddamnmango</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\">@harrys-kingdom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IeDacUKwJGZbqRtfMWzvQ\">@calums-sugarbaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\">@kettxo</a> @send-me-styles <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\">@ashkuuuu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\">@queenbeestuffs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> @harrysfeastedflower <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\">@mendesromano</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@peter-parkersbb</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\">@harrystylinsince1994</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\">@juliassgem</a>\n\n<br/></p>",

Tabloids and headline articles also stacked on the Google page. <i>\u201cHarry and Y/N: the Golden couple\u201d</i> and various other play on words praised their choice of clothing for the night. It then went on how Harry had placed his hand gently on her mid-waist, pulling Y/N closer to him when a slight mob gathered around them on the red carpet. An action that could only be described as \u2018<i>sweet</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>caring</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>protective</i>\u2019 even made the list. </p><p>The authors went on to flatter both their egos; how perfectly they complemented each other, and not just with the gold and black\u2014but as well as their personalities. Harry and Y/N were public figures, him with singing and her with acting, meaning that everything was out in the open. Criticisms and comments weren\u2019t always the best and the pair had learned to handle the rude fans in the best ways. <i>Treat people with kindness</i>, Harry said. And that they did. </p><p>When she was blazed with anger and frustration when a fan harassed her brother through Twitter, Harry was there to steady her by her shoulders and told her to breathe. Somehow, a video of that went viral and indirectly suggested that they were <i>perfect</i> for each other because they knew one another so well. </p><p>After the first screening of the movie, all the invited guests were ushered in the dining hall. Round tables filled with celebrities and notable people mingled with each other for business, or for just an awkward couple of hours. Y/N and Harry were lucky that Liam was in the same table as them, as well as Shawn, and a woman who had been moved to their table by accident. </p><p>It was lucky\u2014indeed\u2014because Y/N didn\u2019t have to pretend to be okay in front of her good friends as much as she would with strangers. Sitting beside Harry was one thing; his hand lazily lying on her exposed thigh was another. Yet, it all meant that both of them were together. Y/N was happy that he was showing affection, albeit for a show, but it\u2019s been days since he\u2019d even come close to her. </p><p>They lived in the same house, it made headlines, of course. It was nothing special, really. If anything, it was only a place for them to rest a night. None of them really hung around that much individually due to their schedules. \u00a0It was a surprise, however, when Harry started coming home extremely late and he sometimes didn\u2019t even step foot for the night at all. It was the moment when things changed significantly for both of them. </p><p>So when Y/N\u2019s attention shifted from the special thanks speech that the director was giving to the cold breeze caressing the skin where Harry\u2019s palm no longer strayed\u2014she wished that he never even gave her a taste of affection in the first place. Because now, she craved for it more than ever and he single-handedly plucked it out from her reach. Her eyes traced the white of his dress shirt\u2014having taken off his suit jacket\u2014only to find it bent in a sneaky wave to a person a few tables away. And <i>god</i>, she wished that she could go back in time and made up an excuse about not attending the event because then the heartbreak she was feeling right now would be nonexistent. </p><p>It was as if a hammer smashed her heart to pieces, beating down the already cracked organ and dwindling to crumbs with no way to save it. A dull throb pounded within her and she squirmed in her seat when her stomach grumbled in the discomfort of the sight. The sound of people clapping threw her off her destructive thoughts and she mindlessly applauded along with them. And with that, people stood up to go on the dance floor, doubling as a bar. She shook her head in rejection when Liam and Shawn asked her if she wanted to join the lot of them. She would rather stay here with her love. </p><p>Sadly, the feeling wasn\u2019t mutual. As soon as people dispersed and gradually loosened up with drinks in hand, Harry was quick to lean over and whisper to Y/N. She had been sitting there, motionlessly, hoping that maybe her boyfriend would ask her to dance with him. Or just do <i>anything</i> with him; she would gladly do it. </p><p>\u201c<i>Y/N, think \u2018m gonna head off tonight</i>,\u201d His breath hit her neck in warm gusts but the chill the ran through her spine was nothing but. </p><p>Though she was expecting such an action sooner or later throughout the night, a part of her really believed that they would be heading home together hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces from an enjoyable night. Maybe they\u2019d even reconciled with the act of making love\u2014she wore her black lingerie that made Harry <i>not</i> want to keep his hands to himself. That wasn\u2019t the case because as Y/N moved her head to face him directly, his eyes never watched her hurt expression and instead, focused on the woman in the red dress. </p><p>She was beautiful. Her dress made her stand out from the crowd of dark colors and Y/N mentally shamed herself for not wearing something else. The design on her chest made ample of cleavage be visible to the eye and Y/N wondered if that was what caught Harry\u2019s attention. It seemed that both of them were itching to leave the place and do God knows what because the woman barely glanced at Y/N even if she was sitting right beside Harry. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</i></b> Y/N questioned, fully knowing the answer to that. He had done it plenty of times before and there was no use in pretending anymore. </p><p>He finally looked down at her, his eyes darkened in lust and dilated in want\u2014not mentioning the hand that was slowly adjusting the bump in his pants. It wasn\u2019t Y/N, however. <i>\u201cJust some hotel,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWill you be coming home tonight?\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c\u2018<i>M not sure, love,\u201d</i> He answered, twisting his body to grab the jacket that hung on the chair. <i>\u201cI\u2019ll text you to let you know, though.\u201d</i></p><p>He gave her a kiss on the cheek, his soft lips being the last touch she\u2019d receive from him for the night. \u201c<i>Love you,\u201d</i></p><p>Harry didn\u2019t wait for her to respond. Quickly standing on his feet, he walked briskly away from Y/N and towards the exit where the woman had been standing for a bit of time while Harry bid his goodbyes. She greeted him with a nod and kept her distance, knowing full well that they couldn\u2019t be risked being seen touching each other. </p><p>She watched as the pair disappeared through the spinning glass doors, his hand hovering over her mid waist like he did with her. Y/N stayed immobilized in her chair, unable to move anything\u2013not even her eyes. Like she said, Harry had done this so many times before that every move he made was predictable, but somehow it still took her by surprise by how easily he moved to leave her behind for another that gave him something she couldn\u2019t\u2013apparently\u2013satisfy.</p><p>Every time he left was like a pull to her heart and it was getting repetitive to the point that there was nothing <i>to</i> pull and she was just in a constant state of pain that seemed to have no end. There were nights where she stayed up late waiting for him to enter through the front doors, and when he didn\u2019t, the worry ceased to disappear and she had to cry herself to sleep at night to let her eyes go sore enough that she couldn\u2019t keep them open. Right now was no different, except she wished that she was in the comfort of their shared home and shielded from the prying cameras that documented every bit of her life. </p><p>Once she felt the wet drops lingering on her waterline, Y/N knew she had to get out of the venue as soon as possible. </p><p>\u201c<i>Y/N! Are you leaving?\u201d</i> Shawn yelled out, calling after her breathlessly. </p><p>She wiped the tears carefully\u2013not wanting to smudge her makeup and look even more distraught\u2013to her temples and hairline. <b><i>\u201cYeah, I uh have an early morning tomorrow,\u201d</i></b></p><p>He nodded understandingly, walking to his seat to grab his suit jacket as well. <i>\u201cWhere\u2019s Harry? Did he leave?\u201d</i> He looked at her with an intense gaze. </p><p>Shawn was one of the few people who knew about their open relationship, aside from the crew that worked with both of them daily. He didn\u2019t approve of it since he didn\u2019t want to see it <i>\u2018blow up in her face</i>\u2019 in the end. </p><p>\u201c<i><b>Yeah, she left with that lady in the red dress,\u201d</b></i> She pointed at the table, and then laid her chin on her forearms. </p><p><i>\u201cTanya?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Is that her name? Actually, whatever don\u2019t make her a real person to me,</i></b>\u201d Y/N interrupted. <i><b>\u201cMakes me feel less hurt somehow if I, you know, pretend.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Shawn bobbed his head, slipping his arms in the holes of the silk fabric. \u201c<i>Let me take you home,\u201d</i></p><p>Defeated and worn out, Y/N agreed\u2013no way was she in a state to travel alone right now. Shawn and Y/N left the building together, and just like Harry, Shawn\u2019s palm grazed the fabric of her lower back carefully to steady her.</p><p>Y/N was so done with today that she didn\u2019t pay mind to the man and the blinding flash that captured a \u2018<i>provocative</i>\u2019 picture of the both of them. She shrugged it off, knowing that the press will twist the pictures to match their words. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>new series! let me know what you thought :D</p><p>\n\npermanent taglist; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\">@kissme-hs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\">@agoddamnmango</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\">@harrys-kingdom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IeDacUKwJGZbqRtfMWzvQ\">@calums-sugarbaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\">@kettxo</a> @send-me-styles <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\">@ashkuuuu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\">@queenbeestuffs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> @harrysfeastedflower <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\">@mendesromano</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@peter-parkersbb</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\">@harrystylinsince1994</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\">@juliassgem</a>\n\n<br></p>",

On the outside, they were completely and utterly enamored with each other. </p><p>The press always managed to snag a picture of Harry\u2019s face, melting in adoration every time he looked at Y/N and he definitely used that to his advantage. He managed to create an image of himself; a kind, humble, affectionate gentleman that would do anything for his lady, Y/N. Don\u2019t get this wrong, Harry was the epitome of God in human form. He was everything described, except his affection weren\u2019t only for Y/N. </p><p>There were a couple of women\u2014a lot of them, actually\u2014who surrounded Harry whenever they went out to dinner parties together. Like a predator to prey, to which Harry was, and he let them have their way at him. Of course, he always made sure that Y/N was driven home safely before he hitched a ride with his flavor of the night. </p><p>Like a few days ago, they were out on a movie premiere on a new Nolan movie. Out of respect and an invitation, Harry had spent days planning his statement outfit. He also set out choices for Y/N to pick from as she would be the final touch of his look that night. While he wore a black blazer with gold embellishments, Y/N dressed in a fitting black dress with dandelion lace and gold beads to match his suit. </p><p>The day after the event was met with significant mentions and tags from fans on both their social media accounts. Tabloids and headline articles also stacked on the Google page. <i>\u201cHarry and Y/N: the Golden couple\u201d</i> and various other play on words praised their choice of clothing for the night. It then went on how Harry had placed his hand gently on her mid-waist, pulling Y/N closer to him when a slight mob gathered around them on the red carpet. An action that could only be described as \u2018<i>sweet</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>caring</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>protective</i>\u2019 even made the list. </p><p>The authors went on to flatter both their egos; how perfectly they complemented each other, and not just with the gold and black\u2014but as well as their personalities. Harry and Y/N were public figures, him with singing and her with acting, meaning that everything was out in the open. Criticisms and comments weren\u2019t always the best and the pair had learned to handle the rude fans in the best ways. <i>Treat people with kindness</i>, Harry said. And that they did. </p><p>When she was blazed with anger and frustration when a fan harassed her brother through Twitter, Harry was there to steady her by her shoulders and told her to breathe. Somehow, a video of that went viral and indirectly suggested that they were <i>perfect</i> for each other because they knew one another so well. </p><p>After the first screening of the movie, all the invited guests were ushered in the dining hall. Round tables filled with celebrities and notable people mingled with each other for business, or for just an awkward couple of hours. Y/N and Harry were lucky that Liam was in the same table as them, as well as Shawn, and a woman who had been moved to their table by accident. </p><p>It was lucky\u2014indeed\u2014because Y/N didn\u2019t have to pretend to be okay in front of her good friends as much as she would with strangers.

And <i>god</i>, she wished that she could go back in time and made up an excuse about not attending the event because then the heartbreak she was feeling right now would be nonexistent. </p><p>It was as if a hammer smashed her heart to pieces, beating down the already cracked organ and dwindling to crumbs with no way to save it.

                "content": "<p><b><i>Summary: Harry and Y/N are in an open relationship</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings: angst</i></b></p><p><b><i>Word Count: 1895 words</i></b></p><p>Harry and Y/N were in an open relationship, that is, they were together for the public but behind closed doors (and non-disclosure agreements) they were far from being the &lsquo;<i>perfect couple</i>&rsquo;. On the outside, they were completely and utterly enamored with each other. </p><p>The press always managed to snag a picture of Harry&rsquo;s face, melting in adoration every time he looked at Y/N and he definitely used that to his advantage. He managed to create an image of himself; a kind, humble, affectionate gentleman that would do anything for his lady, Y/N. Don&rsquo;t get this wrong, Harry was the epitome of God in human form. He was everything described, except his affection weren&rsquo;t only for Y/N. </p><p>There were a couple of women&mdash;a lot of them, actually&mdash;who surrounded Harry whenever they went out to dinner parties together. Like a predator to prey, to which Harry was, and he let them have their way at him. Of course, he always made sure that Y/N was driven home safely before he hitched a ride with his flavor of the night. </p><p>Like a few days ago, they were out on a movie premiere on a new Nolan movie. Out of respect and an invitation, Harry had spent days planning his statement outfit. He also set out choices for Y/N to pick from as she would be the final touch of his look that night. While he wore a black blazer with gold embellishments, Y/N dressed in a fitting black dress with dandelion lace and gold beads to match his suit. </p><p>The day after the event was met with significant mentions and tags from fans on both their social media accounts. Tabloids and headline articles also stacked on the Google page. <i>&ldquo;Harry and Y/N: the Golden couple&rdquo;</i> and various other play on words praised their choice of clothing for the night. It then went on how Harry had placed his hand gently on her mid-waist, pulling Y/N closer to him when a slight mob gathered around them on the red carpet. An action that could only be described as &lsquo;<i>sweet</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>caring</i>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<i>protective</i>&rsquo; even made the list. </p><p>The authors went on to flatter both their egos; how perfectly they complemented each other, and not just with the gold and black&mdash;but as well as their personalities. Harry and Y/N were public figures, him with singing and her with acting, meaning that everything was out in the open. Criticisms and comments weren&rsquo;t always the best and the pair had learned to handle the rude fans in the best ways. <i>Treat people with kindness</i>, Harry said. And that they did. </p><p>When she was blazed with anger and frustration when a fan harassed her brother through Twitter, Harry was there to steady her by her shoulders and told her to breathe. Somehow, a video of that went viral and indirectly suggested that they were <i>perfect</i> for each other because they knew one another so well. </p><p>After the first screening of the movie, all the invited guests were ushered in the dining hall. Round tables filled with celebrities and notable people mingled with each other for business, or for just an awkward couple of hours. Y/N and Harry were lucky that Liam was in the same table as them, as well as Shawn, and a woman who had been moved to their table by accident. </p><p>It was lucky&mdash;indeed&mdash;because Y/N didn&rsquo;t have to pretend to be okay in front of her good friends as much as she would with strangers. Sitting beside Harry was one thing; his hand lazily lying on her exposed thigh was another. Yet, it all meant that both of them were together. Y/N was happy that he was showing affection, albeit for a show, but it&rsquo;s been days since he&rsquo;d even come close to her. </p><p>They lived in the same house, it made headlines, of course. It was nothing special, really. If anything, it was only a place for them to rest a night. None of them really hung around that much individually due to their schedules. &nbsp;It was a surprise, however, when Harry started coming home extremely late and he sometimes didn&rsquo;t even step foot for the night at all. It was the moment when things changed significantly for both of them. </p><p>So when Y/N&rsquo;s attention shifted from the special thanks speech that the director was giving to the cold breeze caressing the skin where Harry&rsquo;s palm no longer strayed&mdash;she wished that he never even gave her a taste of affection in the first place. Because now, she craved for it more than ever and he single-handedly plucked it out from her reach. Her eyes traced the white of his dress shirt&mdash;having taken off his suit jacket&mdash;only to find it bent in a sneaky wave to a person a few tables away. And <i>god</i>, she wished that she could go back in time and made up an excuse about not attending the event because then the heartbreak she was feeling right now would be nonexistent. </p><p>It was as if a hammer smashed her heart to pieces, beating down the already cracked organ and dwindling to crumbs with no way to save it. A dull throb pounded within her and she squirmed in her seat when her stomach grumbled in the discomfort of the sight. The sound of people clapping threw her off her destructive thoughts and she mindlessly applauded along with them. And with that, people stood up to go on the dance floor, doubling as a bar. She shook her head in rejection when Liam and Shawn asked her if she wanted to join the lot of them. She would rather stay here with her love. </p><p>Sadly, the feeling wasn&rsquo;t mutual. As soon as people dispersed and gradually loosened up with drinks in hand, Harry was quick to lean over and whisper to Y/N. She had been sitting there, motionlessly, hoping that maybe her boyfriend would ask her to dance with him. Or just do <i>anything</i> with him; she would gladly do it. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Y/N, think &lsquo;m gonna head off tonight</i>,&rdquo; His breath hit her neck in warm gusts but the chill the ran through her spine was nothing but. </p><p>Though she was expecting such an action sooner or later throughout the night, a part of her really believed that they would be heading home together hand-in-hand with smiles on their faces from an enjoyable night. Maybe they&rsquo;d even reconciled with the act of making love&mdash;she wore her black lingerie that made Harry <i>not</i> want to keep his hands to himself. That wasn&rsquo;t the case because as Y/N moved her head to face him directly, his eyes never watched her hurt expression and instead, focused on the woman in the red dress. </p><p>She was beautiful. Her dress made her stand out from the crowd of dark colors and Y/N mentally shamed herself for not wearing something else. The design on her chest made ample of cleavage be visible to the eye and Y/N wondered if that was what caught Harry&rsquo;s attention. It seemed that both of them were itching to leave the place and do God knows what because the woman barely glanced at Y/N even if she was sitting right beside Harry. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</i></b> Y/N questioned, fully knowing the answer to that. He had done it plenty of times before and there was no use in pretending anymore. </p><p>He finally looked down at her, his eyes darkened in lust and dilated in want&mdash;not mentioning the hand that was slowly adjusting the bump in his pants. It wasn&rsquo;t Y/N, however. <i>&ldquo;Just some hotel,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Will you be coming home tonight?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>M not sure, love,&rdquo;</i> He answered, twisting his body to grab the jacket that hung on the chair. <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll text you to let you know, though.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He gave her a kiss on the cheek, his soft lips being the last touch she&rsquo;d receive from him for the night. &ldquo;<i>Love you,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t wait for her to respond. Quickly standing on his feet, he walked briskly away from Y/N and towards the exit where the woman had been standing for a bit of time while Harry bid his goodbyes. She greeted him with a nod and kept her distance, knowing full well that they couldn&rsquo;t be risked being seen touching each other. </p><p>She watched as the pair disappeared through the spinning glass doors, his hand hovering over her mid waist like he did with her. Y/N stayed immobilized in her chair, unable to move anything&ndash;not even her eyes. Like she said, Harry had done this so many times before that every move he made was predictable, but somehow it still took her by surprise by how easily he moved to leave her behind for another that gave him something she couldn&rsquo;t&ndash;apparently&ndash;satisfy.</p><p>Every time he left was like a pull to her heart and it was getting repetitive to the point that there was nothing <i>to</i> pull and she was just in a constant state of pain that seemed to have no end. There were nights where she stayed up late waiting for him to enter through the front doors, and when he didn&rsquo;t, the worry ceased to disappear and she had to cry herself to sleep at night to let her eyes go sore enough that she couldn&rsquo;t keep them open. Right now was no different, except she wished that she was in the comfort of their shared home and shielded from the prying cameras that documented every bit of her life. </p><p>Once she felt the wet drops lingering on her waterline, Y/N knew she had to get out of the venue as soon as possible. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Y/N! Are you leaving?&rdquo;</i> Shawn yelled out, calling after her breathlessly. </p><p>She wiped the tears carefully&ndash;not wanting to smudge her makeup and look even more distraught&ndash;to her temples and hairline. <b><i>&ldquo;Yeah, I uh have an early morning tomorrow,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>He nodded understandingly, walking to his seat to grab his suit jacket as well. <i>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Harry? Did he leave?&rdquo;</i> He looked at her with an intense gaze. </p><p>Shawn was one of the few people who knew about their open relationship, aside from the crew that worked with both of them daily. He didn&rsquo;t approve of it since he didn&rsquo;t want to see it <i>&lsquo;blow up in her face</i>&rsquo; in the end. </p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Yeah, she left with that lady in the red dress,&rdquo;</b></i> She pointed at the table, and then laid her chin on her forearms. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Tanya?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Is that her name? Actually, whatever don&rsquo;t make her a real person to me,</i></b>&rdquo; Y/N interrupted. <i><b>&ldquo;Makes me feel less hurt somehow if I, you know, pretend.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Shawn bobbed his head, slipping his arms in the holes of the silk fabric. &ldquo;<i>Let me take you home,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Defeated and worn out, Y/N agreed&ndash;no way was she in a state to travel alone right now. Shawn and Y/N left the building together, and just like Harry, Shawn&rsquo;s palm grazed the fabric of her lower back carefully to steady her.</p><p>Y/N was so done with today that she didn&rsquo;t pay mind to the man and the blinding flash that captured a &lsquo;<i>provocative</i>&rsquo; picture of the both of them. She shrugged it off, knowing that the press will twist the pictures to match their words. </p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>new series! let me know what you thought :D</p><p>\n\npermanent taglist; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\">@kissme-hs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\">@agoddamnmango</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\">@harrys-kingdom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IeDacUKwJGZbqRtfMWzvQ\">@calums-sugarbaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\">@kettxo</a> @send-me-styles <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\">@ashkuuuu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\">@queenbeestuffs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> @harrysfeastedflower <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\">@mendesromano</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@peter-parkersbb</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\">@harrystylinsince1994</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\">@juliassgem</a>\n\n<br /></p>",
