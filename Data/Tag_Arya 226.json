(She didn\u2019t know her grandfather had secret plans to deal with the Freys and Boltons, but had a honest and fierce reaction regardless; also note her older sister Wynafryd, who was told the plans, but had to pretend to go along with everything including pretending to be happy about her own upcoming Frey marriage.) And of course there\u2019s Lyanna Stark, who at 14 defended her father\u2019s bannerman, young Howland Reed, from being assaulted by asshole bigots, and <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/64662945112/ive-been-reading-your-asoiaf-theories-for-hours\">acted in disguise as a mystery knight to further chastise them</a>.<br></p><p>However\u2026 when it comes down to it, and specifically regarding the recent generations of House Stark, let me give you these quotes:</p><blockquote><p><small><b>Q:</b> How closely does Westeros resemble the real Middle Ages in terms \nof social customs and gender roles?

(What they did to Bran is blasphemy, my boy didn\u2019t deserve that.) </p><p>I\u2019m pretty much just watching because hey, new material and a lot of curiosity since I\u2019ve dedicated almost a decade of my life to this. Damn if I don\u2019t see it through to the end. </p><p>So my expectations for S8 are quite low. There\u2019s obviously going to be Cersei\u2019s betrayal of her promise, drama for about five hot minutes for Jon\u2019s parentage, potential new Targ baby, and lots of battles with the Lannisters and the Night King.</p><p>Regarding Jon and Arya - I\u2019m very unsure. The thing is, Arya is George\u2019s favourite but she\u2019s clearly not D&amp;D\u2019s so while I do believe the show is broadly going to end the same way as the books, I fail to see it in the case for Arya. With no Lady Stoneheart, no fake Arya, no warging with Nymeria, Arya\u2019s story has been so watered down, I just can\u2019t see how it\u2019ll end the same way in the books and on the show. Sailing west while her pack lives is literally one of the lamest, most simplistic ways of ending her story because you couldn\u2019t be asked to develop it properly. </p><p>So with that in mind, I\u2019ve always held the belief that should Jon and Arya both survive, they\u2019d want to remain close to each other because hey, they miss the hell out of one another and book!Jon died for her. I\u2019m hoping we get that in S8 at least - scenes where they clearly confide and trust each other, where they have each other\u2019s backs etc. </p><p>If I get a fight scene with both of them in the same shot, I\u2019ll be happy. And Arya jumping into Jon\u2019s arms like she did in S1. That\u2019s pretty much the extent of my expectations. </p><p>I understand your concerns. I don\u2019t anticipate trouble between Jon and Arya because they\u2019ve mentioned before that he\u2019s her favourite person. The drama isn\u2019t about Jon vs the other Starks, as much as people want to play it up. There\u2019s a literal apocalypse on the horizon, so nah, no drama. Arya and Jon love each other, and there\u2019s no two-way interpretation about it. So the reunion will always be lovely, I think, and I hope all their scenes after will be just so as well. </p><p>Thanks for the ask! </p>",
