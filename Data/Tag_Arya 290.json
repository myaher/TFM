She has an older sister, Sansa Stark. She also has an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon and a &ldquo;bastard half-brother&rdquo;, Jon Snow.\n\n<b>Arya </b>rejects the notion that she must become a lady and marry for influence and power. Instead, she believes that she can forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of arms, and is bored by embroidery and other &ldquo;lady-like&rdquo; pursuits. She takes after her father and has a quarrelsome relationship with her sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and personalities. She is close to her &ldquo;half-brother&rdquo; Jon, who is also something of an outsider.</p><p>After narrowly escaping the persecution of House Stark by House Lannister, <b>Arya </b>is trained as a Faceless Man at the House of Black and White in Braavos, and uses her new skills to bring those who have wronged her family to justice. <br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1810\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img data-orig-height=\"1810\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ba66a4bc966170fba70e74e066f7f61/tumblr_inline_pewd0cw4Ux1qbv7u8_540.jpg\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Appearance and Personality</i></b></h2><p><b>Arya Stark</b> is a tomboyish girl who likes fighting and exploring, unlike her older sister Sansa Stark. Her fierce temperament is often discouraged by Septa Mordane. She is left-handed, skinny and fast. With her dark hair, grey eyes and long stern face, <b>Arya </b>resembles more of a Stark than a Tully, despite all her siblings. Jon Snow, her half-brother, is the other one of the Stark children who have more of a Stark appearance. The bastard son of her father is also the sibling she likes the most. She is very good at mathematics and horse riding.</p><p>Her behavior and appearance makes people often mistake her for a boy. <b>Arya </b>is wild, adventurous, unpredictable and extremely willful. She absolutely hates the feminine expectations pressed upon her, in which her older sister Sansa absolutely thrives, and neither aspires in needlework or womanly graces as she does. <b>Arya </b>is incredibly spirited and very brave when need be, and completely capable of fighting for herself when she is backed into a corner. She is often quick to anger in some situations, but is also a fast learner in her own right and can quickly adapt to her own situation.</p><p>What largely motivates <b>Arya </b>throughout the War of the Five Kings is vengeance: for her father, for her friend, for the injustices that have befallen her family. <b>Arya </b>has fallen into the obsessive habit of reciting the names of the people she intends to kill before she goes to sleep, and when she encounters certain people she has intended to kill she can often become reckless and frightfully violent, as evidenced by her brutal killing of the Tickler during the brawl at the crossroads inn.</p><p><b>Arya </b>longs to be reunited with her surviving family, and is devastated by all those she loses. She has slowly become withdrawn and very introverted throughout her experiences.</p><p><b>\n\nArya </b>can be a rather cold-blooded, slightly sadistic person at times, especially while confronting and killing those who are on her death list. Though she was initially apathetic but satisfied with killing Meryn Trant and Polliver, she did not attempt to hide her glee over slitting Walder Frey&rsquo;s throat. While she certainly possesses compassion and kindness, her time with The Hound and the Faceless Men have taught her to be ruthless to those who have wronged her and her family and has shown to be willing to use psychological mind games to worsen her enemies fate before killing them.

Eventually, after receiving training from Syrio Forel and later from the Faceless Men, <b>Arya </b>increased her skills tremendously, being able to master the water dancing style to such an extent that she was able not only to dodge a punch from a much larger man but also to kill the much older and powerful Waif and fight on equal terms with Brienne of Tarth, one of the best warriors in Westeros.</p><p><b>Arya </b>also possesses a keen analytical mind and good acting skills, being able to perfectly emulate those whose face she is wearing while putting her Faceless Men training into practice.</p><p>In addition, she is proficient in infiltration, capable of sneaking undetected to The Twins Castle and claimed to be able to do the same through Winterfell Castle. This is presumed to be another skill learned through the Faceless Men training, though it was never shown in the show.</p><p><b>Arya </b>is relatively resistant to pain despite her small stature, capable to outrun and later defeat a skilled assassin in spite of severe stab wounds.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"768\"><img data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"768\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32de7ca5c5e4e5accedb53709f1cd71a/tumblr_inline_pewd1cHMSo1qbv7u8_540.jpg\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Kill List</i></b></h2><ul><li><b>Cersei Lannister</b> - For her role in the execution of her father and the death of Lady.<br/></li><li><b>The Mountain</b> - For leading the brutal torture at Harrenhal.

        "body": "<h1>Gendrya and its chances of becoming canon - part 1</h1><p><b>this post contains spoilers from most of the seasons of Game Of Thrones</b></p><p>Gendrya, also known as the shipname of Arya stark and Gendry Baratheon, has become a quite popular pair in our fandom. In this masterpost i will try my best to list and discuss most of the reasons why it has a huge potential of becoming canon. </p><p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b></p><p><i>in no way shape or form am i going to force someone into believing that they&rsquo;re going to be a romantic pair in the following season. There&rsquo;s obviously a possibility of their relationship staying exactly the same; this is purely based on theories and real facts from the show.</i></p><p><i>The masterpost will provide you with information from the show, not the books. In all honesty, George Martin treated the ship more fairly than the show and respectfully gave them way more scenes, so to avoid messing up the whole post, i&rsquo;m going to be speaking about the show!gendrya. </i></p><p><i>i&rsquo;m going to be using some very interesting information from the blog of my good pal <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a>. They make some very thoughtful points so definitely check out their blog if you&rsquo;re up for some great Gendrya discussions. Please keep in mind that there are some things you might have already heard of; and definitely correct me if i get something wrong.</i></p><h2><b>Before meeting each other.</b></h2><p>I think it is best to start from the very beginning, and by that i mean even before Arya and Gendry first met. </p><p>A very interesting theory i&rsquo;ve been thinking about is Robert Baratheon who is obviously the father of Gendry, telling Ned that they would join their houses with marrying their children.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I have a son, you have a daughter, we&rsquo;ll join our houses&rdquo;</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"393\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"i-am-a-book-thief:cWCa66esRtCxYjZc7T8Yrw:Zcd3Yl2NvOmzK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a6e2718db0c50457062fe7dabb54396/tumblr_ot8s6d1van1u8xl1vo1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"393\"/></figure><p>. The first thing you probably think of when reading this is Sansa and Joffrey who were supposed to marry each other and as Robert hoped, join the houses to bring peace. Though we all know how that ended,-Joffrey (who wasn&rsquo;t even Robert&rsquo;s son in the first place) ended up dying and Sansa&rsquo;s future took a whole different path to the point where you&rsquo;d think her desire for marriage had completely disappeared. This might be them foreshadowing the potential future of Arya and Gendry. I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;ll get married, but i am saying that this could simply represent the development of their relationship in a romantic way. It would be sort of ironic to see them getting married since Arya had been strongly against it since the very beginning of the show. that leads us to the noticeable twists game of thrones has,- Ned died in the first season when no one expected him to, Robb didn&rsquo;t even get the chance to rule Winterfell when half of the fandom was convinced he was going to be the next king, Jon fell in love with daenerys which was not only never mentioned in the books, but was also rushed and happened very quickly (unlike Gendrya who had plenty of time to develop feelings for each other, they practically closed an important chapter of their lives while they were together); that being said, you can never really predict where Arya&rsquo;s path takes us next. The show always hits us with changes and whether they&rsquo;re good or bad, they&rsquo;re often very unexpected. If you ask me, Arya&rsquo;s story is one of those that has not yet ended and there is exactly that one twist missing that is going to wrap it all up. I believe that &ldquo;twist&rdquo; has something to do with Gendry. All the other questions in her storyline are answered,- she chose to remain her identity and not become no one, she got back to her family and proved she would never betray any of them, she chose to follow her childhood dream and became her own hero. The last part is love, i believe. And Arya will need to figure it out and battle with making important decisions one more time. Their &ldquo;slow burn&rdquo; romance as i like to call it has been leading up to that all this time and i&rsquo;m hoping they will be able to fit it in and drop the bomb in the last season. </p><p>Bringing the attention to Gendry, his purpose and identity is really interesting if you think about it. Let&rsquo;s go way back and start from the main point of his role in the show. Gendry Waters is the Bastard son of Robert Baratheon, right? That&rsquo;s very clear when you observe how he acts, how he looks and even talks,-if he had been around earlier the king would instantly recognize him as his bastard kid because Gendry is a perfect definition of the name Baratheon. His appearance - dark, rough looking hair and beautiful blue eyes flawlessly portrays the house. Anyone from Cersei&rsquo;s children could not even compare to how much Gendry looked like his father. There are countless similarities which you can read more<i><b> </b></i>about<i><b> </b></i>on<b><i> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a> &rsquo;</i></b>s<b><i> </i></b>blogif you&rsquo;re interested, but i&rsquo;m going to swiftly turn back to out main topic to avoid confusion. If you take a minute to observe the plot, the show could&rsquo;ve been perfectly fine without him. That came out harsh but don&rsquo;t get me wrong, - i love him to death and he&rsquo;s one of my favorites, he has in fact done very heroic, important stuff but realistically speaking since he isn&rsquo;t technically one of the protagonists, Gendry could&rsquo;ve been easily replaced with any random \u00a0character be it male or female, with someone like Podrick, without messing up the whole story. Instead the author strictly made him to be a bastard son of king Robert who would later meet the princess of Winterfell. See? the puzzle instantly fits. Not to mention that there were quite a few characters similar to Gendry in the show who died or were very close to dying while despite disappearing for a entire season, the boy still remained alive and received a big development from just a bastard boy who wasn&rsquo;t even aware of his identity and spent his life serving others, to Gendry, the son of King Robert Baratheon who befriended Arya&rsquo;s brother a.k.a our future king and placed a huge role in helping the queen make progress in the battle. There are characters that you&rsquo;d never expect to lose, there are characters that you know will die. but there are also a few people in GOT that have big chances of making it till the end for various different reasons, i think Gendry is one of them. May i mention how they brought him back in the last season and made him play a huge role? The writers would not make Gendry stand out if he didn&rsquo;t have a future in game of thrones, period. He is important and his story isn&rsquo;t over so killing him would be BLOODY DUMB. You started his journey and made it more significant than it could&rsquo;ve been, now it&rsquo;s your job to respect your own decisions and not act like Gendry was nothing to the show. Like mentioned above, he could&rsquo;ve been replaced with literally anyone who would be less relevant but noo. It\u2019s\u00a0<i>Gendry Baratheon</i>. As you keep watching the show and analyse his role in Arya&rsquo;s life, there are so many things about his persona that just make sense. His name makes is easier for me to connect the dots and get to the point which just screams gendrya. and That&rsquo;s one of the things that convinces me that Gendry is going to pull through this and stay in the show till the end. </p><p>A very significant scene to me is also his first meeting with Jon. Many people were upset because he didn&rsquo;t mention Arya and i&rsquo;m not gonna lie at first that left me feeling kind of bitter as well, but after investing into it more i managed to find possible explanations. I like to look at it from the bright side considering that the scene is so much more than just some boys interacting. Gendry&rsquo;s meeting with Jon was done in a way that strangely seemed too much like Ned and Robert&rsquo;s and i can bet my whole life that it was done this way on purpose. It didn&rsquo;t feel too &ldquo;formal&rdquo;, serious or tense, which is what you would normally expect since Jon is literally the legal king of the seven kingdoms. remember Ned and Robert meeting in the very first season? It went exactly like Jon and Gendry\u2019s; They started off with a slightly tense atmosphere until shortly after it transformed into them laughing and hugging.\u00a0the chemistry between the characters was undoubtedly there,- they jokingly made fun of each other and instantly got along which speaks a lot about his future relationship with the Starks; name any other character Jon talked to in such a friendly, &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; way as if they had known each other since forever. If Gendry left such a great first impression on Jon, that means there&rsquo;s a clear possibility of him being in contact with not only him but the others as well. and by others yes, i mainly mean Arya. Why would he want to become good pals with Jon? Because he&rsquo;s Arya&rsquo;s brother. He wants to make up for the fact that he was part of the reason they got separated in the first place and get as close to her as possible. As for him mentioning the girl, none of us know what was going on in Gendry&rsquo;s head and that&rsquo;s why there are so many thoughts and theories about this. Probably an opinion closest to reality is that as the fandom agrees,- Gendry might&rsquo;ve thought Arya was dead. Obviously after being seperated for quite a long time plus Arya completely disappearing from Gendry&rsquo;s life, he would think she wasn&rsquo;t alive anymore. It seems logical. Even if you don&rsquo;t agree with that particular version, Gendry never really got a chance to ask about her either. Once he joined the others to help out on their mission, clearly all they were focused on was the duty, therefore i hightly doubt D&amp;D would give us the fanservise and focus on anything else than the white walkers. If you think about it, all they discuss throughout the seventh season is the plan and how to accomplish it. Rescued from serving people he didn&rsquo;t want to serve at all, Gendry gave it his all to concentrate on correcting his mistakes, which is the best excuse for this situation. He put off any of his personal issues and wishes to devote himself to saving the world legitimately, meaning he never let himself catch a break and did whatever he could to stay right beside Jon. The boy prevented himself from expressing his emotions which is comprehensible,- even if he didn&rsquo;t think Arya was dead, i reckon Gendry wouldn&rsquo;t dare to ask about her when it was his first proper interaction with Jon, she was said to be his sister after all and the last thing he would want is to make things uncomfortable and awkward between them. Both reasons are quite coherent, believe whichever you want. His commitment towards Snow perfectly showed how much he cares. Not only about the people, Jon or the world. But how much he cares about helping out someone whose sister meant so much to him.</p><p>Gendry (still) is in the process of realizing that hey, he could be suitable for his highborn lady after all and if they get the confirmation from Jon(or Daenerys) who will probably become the king, there&rsquo;s no problem in them being together. It&rsquo;s apparent that Daenerys strongly dislikes Robert, but she was the one trying to prove that the child should not be punished for their parents&rsquo; mistakes, which speaks a lot about how she might&rsquo;ve reacted. By now it&rsquo;s obvious that she isn&rsquo;t cruel nor is she stupid. If Gendry and Arya did get together, i personally see no possibilities of Daenerys denying their relationship. Even if by some chance she did, Jon would proceed to convince her to make it happen because he would be perfectly aware of the fact that it could make Arya happy. Besides may i bring this back,- Gendry left a very good impression on him which assures Jon that his sister would not be in any sorts of danger. I firmly believe he trusts him by now. What i&rsquo;m trying to get across is that in my opinion this just proves that Gendry shares his part of the story with Arya, that&rsquo;s why they are destinied to end up together. it just makes sense.</p><p>Lets move on to Arya before and after meeting Gendry. Unlike the boy, Arya did get screentime before meeting him since she&rsquo;s one of the main characters so it&rsquo;s easier to discuss what changes i spotted in her persona. In the first season, up to until the third one we see a tough little girl dreaming about becoming a warrior and being just like her father. It&rsquo;s obvious that she did not even want to imagine her and marriage and continouesly denied the idea, even making fun of Sansa for liking Joffrey. I think that&rsquo;s quite normal and does not mean that she is incapable of falling in love with someone. Arya was very young in the first season, still practically a tiny child so i think it&rsquo;s not surprising that she thought marriage was stupid. In no way am i saying that she suddenly changed her point of view when she grew up, but Arya had a very strict opinion about even considering liking someone romantically let alone spending her entire life with them and that&rsquo;s usually how most children think. Arya, around like 11 years old, would never admit anything like that. That&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m now emphasizing on the fact that her behavior and actions drastically changed later on, a very \u00a0good example is her checking out Gendry&rsquo;s naked torso in the third season which i&rsquo;m going to discuss more later. This sums up her growth quite well, she went from the kid who was convinced she was never going to dedicate any time to love, to a girl with her first crush. As i mentioned above, her and Sansa could be on the path of switching their roles. Sansa is either going to lose interest in getting married or finally find a good partner for her(which i doubt will happen to be completely honest) and Arya falls in love with Gendry despite starting off with different expectations.\u00a0</p><p>during the time period when her and Gendry got separated, there isn&rsquo;t many scenes with Arya mentioning him either. Believe me i was hoping for gendrya the whole time as well but just like with his situation, i was able to quickly understand the case. Arya&rsquo;s storyline throughout season 6 was very important for her to get where she is now. I believe it was essential to make her go through all that stuff to prove a point: It was not for Arya. Besides the way i personally see it is that In the gap between their reunion, there really was no time for them to be mourning over each other&rsquo;s loss. Arya tried to become someone else and forget everything from her past. It didn&rsquo;t work out. She failed to become no one for a reason, she decided to keep calling herself Arya Stark for a reason. If her story contained no love,- be it platonic or romantic whatsoever, i don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d bother to give up so easily OR come back to Winterfell. This may seem like a reach to some people, but for me it makes complete sense,- Arya came back because Joaquin&rsquo;s path didn&rsquo;t cross hers. The life she thought was perfect for her didn&rsquo;t turn out to be suitable at all and i&rsquo;m glad she was able to realize that early enough. No matter how much she changed, she belonged (still does) to Winterfell from the very beginning, there were certain people in her life that she could not let go. The writers made her change her mind and come back because there was so much more waiting for her there, because that leads us to what comes next.</p><h2><b>other ships</b></h2><p>some people seem to ship Gendry and Arya with other characters and I&rsquo;m certainly not here to fight them because of that, but for my fellow gendrya stans, i&rsquo;m going to try and explain why there&rsquo;s no chances of either of them ending up with someone else. I guess what you could call &ldquo;the most popular ships besides gendrya&rdquo; are sansa and Gendry and Arya and Joaquin. Let&rsquo;s start with strongly denying the first one.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know where to even begin because i find it challenging to comprehend what gave people reasons to ship Sansa with Gendry. On a very simple note,-they haven&rsquo;t even met. They have NOT interacted while Gendrya has had a major build up since the third season. When it is seemingly clear that both of them started gradually developing feelings for each other, i can&rsquo;t imagine Sansa proceeding to literally betray her sister and try to steal her man, lol. She grew up, became more mature and as i mentioned earlier, probably lost a big part of her interest in romance. I personally can only imagine Sansa hyping up their relationship and teasing Arya about how in love she is. Hear me out,- the writers have made tons of questionable decisions throughout the years of shooting the series, but i believe this is where they cross the border. They are perfectly aware of the fact that making Sansa and Gendry canon would stir up drama, not only because people ship gendrya, but also because it does not make sense. It would be wrong, rushed and very, very weird turn. Gendry has never expressed any interest in Sansa nor has he even metioned her.</p><p>As for Joaquin and Arya, i think i am able to get why people like the pair, though in no way do i encourage anyone to do so because it will never happen, obviously. Do i believe that Arya loved Joaquin? No. I personally see them as two individuals who had a very weird friendship connecting them. Arya never really had friends and Joaquin was one of the first people she dared to refer to as such, so of course she would be shown expressing some type of platonic feelings towards him, for instance her choosing him as her teacher or that one time she genuinely got scared, thinking he had died. Joaquin and Arya&rsquo;s friendship was one big rollercoaster which i&rsquo;m struggling to fully figure out to this day. Probably the only aspect i&rsquo;m completely sure about is that they weren&rsquo;t in love. Both of them knew they had found someone with similar goals and personality so obviously they were left on good terms and managed to even work together for some time. Joaquin taught Arya stuff that gave her a different view on certain stuff and more experience which came out quite useful in the following episodes. The two of them were never destined to be together and Joaquin&rsquo;s death was one of the things that proved that. Almost every pair in Game of thrones has a mutual connection, great chemistry and are visibly suitable for each other, however Arya and Joaquin never had that. There was not a bit romance in their scenes and they had no development in that terms whatsoever.</p><p>We already know Gendry has eyes on Arya and only.</p><p>That being said, anyone can ship what they want, but once again,-this is for gendrya shippers who think that either of the ships mentioned above have any potential of becoming canon. No they don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m pretty positive that the author and the creators of the show would never do that to us.</p><h2><b>Their scenes</b></h2><p>As mentioned in the top of this post, George Martin spoiled us and included quite a few moments of Gendrya in the books. If you&rsquo;ve read the series there&rsquo;s NO way you didn&rsquo;t interpret their relationship as a romantic one just because it&rsquo;s clearly coded that way. Like i promised i&rsquo;m not going to be going in details about why George is amazing, but it will surely take more effort to analyse the moments from the show untill i manage to get every detail of like the three scenes we got written down and examined. </p><p>Starting from the very first scene we saw them together in. I have so many thoughts about it. We all know Arya and Gendry are incredibly badass together or separated and that scene was a very good example of how well they work together. The bull and the wolf,-they&rsquo;re a perfect team and it seems as if the writers wanted to get that across immediately once they had met.</p><p>I adore the first scene. Arya gains the courage to stand up for herself despite two strangers probably scaring the shit out of her trapped at a place she knows nothing about. As she finds the energy within herself to stand up and point Needle towards hotpie&rsquo;s chin, forcing him to steadily step back, Gendry joins from behind and threatens the boy to leave Arya alone. What i love the most about the scene is Gendry&rsquo;s bitter words mixed with humor (*insert his sentence here*) and the way he defended the innocent kid. It already gives you a general idea of how lovely and courageous his personality is, leaving the best first impression for a character if you ask me. The scene is done so well in the show, he doesn&rsquo;t even think twice before scolding hotpie and shrugging it off shortly, treating Arya quite decently.\u00a0 As if he already knew he was dealing with a princess.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"310\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"ivorybxlton:G6ZE4HPjIXvJpAu8p3-3Rw:ZbEjPj2BKSkfQ\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2c6b696e9c394ce00f3d9459d252b90/tumblr_ocm1dbIeE11ugi1dio1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"310\"/></figure><p><i>look at them.</i></p><p>Now this is a tricky thing to discuss, though one of my personal headcannons that can potentially be very true, is that show!Gendry knew Arya was a girl from that exact scene. What i mean is that he didn&rsquo;t even need to try and figure it out since he knew in the first place, while others were confused even after finding out she wasn&rsquo;t a boy. \u00a0<i>&ldquo;do you think i&rsquo;m as stupid as the rest of them?</i>&rdquo; he says once he sees her surprised face after admitting that Arya had done a poor job lying to him; and it&rsquo;s true, he isn&rsquo;t. Gendry is incredibly smart despite not being perfect at reading and writing which by the way, was not his fault at all. Every scene with Gendry in it in the show truly does make him seem more intelligent and clever than the people he mentioned. It speaks a lot about his difference from the other boys and really makes him stand out; also adds another reason to the list of why they&rsquo;d be a perfect pair. Despite being raised as a bastard and having to go through so much rough stuff at such a young age, Gendry inherited some of the best traits of a Baratheon and grew up to be a bright man. He is quite strong and fit physically, but he is also competent and wise which if you ask me, makes him perfect for Arya. It&rsquo;s her. There&rsquo;s no way she would fall in love with someone less cool than her, so i think it&rsquo;s safe to say that Gendry is the only one right for her. </p><p>Moving onto the scene where he finds out about Arya&rsquo;s true identity, that one is definitely one of my favorites. There&rsquo;s so much that needs to be said about it because it describes so many parts of their relationship. It&rsquo;s a good portrayal of their bond, trust, chemistry.</p><p>I love how Arya didn&rsquo;t expect him to find out about her at all and tried her best to hide her shocked reaction the first time he confronted her about it. Gendry was very casual and subtle about it, just sliding the topic into their small banter as if it hadn&rsquo;t even been a huge deal and i find that endearing in a way. It expresses how mature he was at the age of 15, any other boy would most likely freak out and act as if they&rsquo;d seen a miracle.\u00a0</p><p>Arya could&rsquo;ve easily rejected him and found more ways to lie in order to convince him otherwise, yet not only did she come clean, but also trusted him enough to admit who she really was. That was an another clear sign of &ldquo;they met and instantly found the courage within themselves to trust each other even with their deepest secrets&rdquo;. Of course the boy was very honest with her as well; \u00a0Tell me Gendry apologizing for peeing in front of her and claiming he should&rsquo;ve been calling her &ldquo;M'lady&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t the cutest thing you saw throughout that season. What left me thinking is how he believed her immediately. Sure, Arya&rsquo;s explanation seemed pretty legit, but i doubt anyone else would let themselves to trust her that easily. He gained much more respect for Arya after finding out that the person he had been talking to wasn&rsquo;t just any other girl but the highorn lady of Winterfell. I love how Arya is already comfortable with playfully punching the guy because he had called her a lady; and the dialogue in that scene is hilarious and well done. They&rsquo;re already acting like best friends despite not even knowing each other that much and the apparent flirty tension often gets mixed within their conversations which i find very lovely. It&rsquo;s so sweet how the angry bean Arya makes Gendry full on giggle and look up at her with the most &ldquo;in love&rdquo; look in his eyes. That right there, is good acting.</p><p>I bet Gendry had a hard time hiding \u00a0his shock when finding out that the highborn lady of Winterfell was that badass and fearless instead of a bit more girly and petite as he would&rsquo;ve expected. And i&rsquo;m strongly convinced that was the thing about Arya catching his attention and making him realize how different, stronger and better she was than any of the women he had met before.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>One of my absolute favorite scenes is Arya sneakily checking out her man. The scene is so incredibly iconic and remarkable that it most likely popped up in your head instantly. That&rsquo;s when any viewer immediately realizes that the writers&rsquo; intention was to show Arya&rsquo;s developing first crush.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"aryaxgendrysource:HUI6p2-kSq1FvfPGgW_XiA:ZNzrpg2OuvhfT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9631435cfd2ef5bfd5bc3c16a2fe08df/tumblr_ounqrcfAM01vwdm8yo1_r1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p>As Gendry trains, fully focused on his weapon, Arya literally glances up and down his body with that hungry ass look in her eyes. sorry. had to be said. It&rsquo;s the truth.\u00a0</p><p>We had definitely never seen the girl impressed on that level by a man in any previous (or following) seasons. Arya was just a tiny girl and as she grew up she started feeling different emotions, therefore i think it&rsquo;s quite obvious that we got to experience that with her in the said scene. Maisie&rsquo;s acting was so damn good. She managed to portray the exact same feelings Arya had perfectly which just added more reasons for people to ship the pair.</p><p>The most important scene in my opinion is of course, &ldquo;i can be your family&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m going to begin with firmly emphasizing on Maisie&rsquo;s comment about the scene.</p><p><b>Rolling stone: she obiously has family on her mind in this episode. But when she tells Gendry &ldquo;i can be your family&rdquo;, it sounds like she might mean something very different - even if she herself barely realizes it yet.</b></p><p>I really love the way this was put because they tried to avoid any major spoilers, but gave us higher chances of finding out more about how Arya feels towards Gendry. Bless them for bringing this up. It&rsquo;s clear that everyone, be it people from the fandom or outside interprets their relatioship as a romantic one.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what Maisie answers:</p><p><b>&ldquo;At first i read it as &rsquo;&lsquo;You can come to winterfell, i&rsquo;ll show you how everything goes, and you can come and sit at the table with us&rdquo;, i thought it would be a bit like Theon. But when i was doing the scene, director Alex Graves said &ldquo;when you say that last line, 'i can be your family&rsquo;, say it like 'i love you&rdquo;&rsquo;. And that&rsquo;s the take that they used.</b></p><p>To this day i&rsquo;m still struggling to believe that&rsquo;s real, but it is. Maisie practically said that Arya never saw Gendry as a brother (like Theon) but as something else. Something more. With that exact words she realized she had certain feelings towards Gendry that made it so difficult to let him go and leave. I can&rsquo;t help but mention their acting one more time because it was absolutely phenomenal. Game Of Thrones has something for every type of viewers, Fantasy, adventure and romance,-that&rsquo;s one of the reasons it&rsquo;s so popular. That being said, we&rsquo;ve had tons of different pairs with their love stories; The ones who ended up dead, the ones who survived. One aspect connecting all of them is the story of how they met and fell in love. Now this is a very bold thing to say so not many people might agree with me, but i personally think that Gendrya, the ship that hasn&rsquo;t even become canon yet, is the most romantic and epic yet, it leaves us with so much feels and want. I never felt so much love and passion towards any other ship from the show and it&rsquo;s very apparent to me why. I don&rsquo;t remember any couple from GOT that had such a slow burn, amorous and well developed plot. Gendrya does. They have so much potential. Both Maisie and Joe understand that and they give it their all to make Gendrya so obvious. In the said scene, Gendry looks like he is legitimately holding back tears as he rejects Arya&rsquo;s offer and decides to stay. He seems like as if he&rsquo;s having second thoughts and doubting his choices, there&rsquo;s so much pain depicted on his face and yet he doesn&rsquo;t have enough time to reconsider. Maisie does say the last like just like &ldquo;i love you&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s indeed much more said than just &ldquo;come to Winterfell and stay with us&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s her trying to express unconditional love and fondness. Arya is aware of her feelings towards Gendry and by the time she fully realized that, she had to leave. Just like Gendry, Arya looks just as upset and hurt. Looks like in that moment, \u00a0it took all her willpower to turn around and go.\u00a0</p><p>A classic Gendrya moment is her being immensely worried when the red woman took Gendry, disappearing without any explanations. I can&rsquo;t get over how mad she got and never stopped worrying about him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t talk to traitors&rdquo; CAN YOU BELIEVE HER. Arya was beyond aggrieved to the point where she even refused to talk. Her expression when Gendry gave in and they basically tied him up so he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to escape was priceless. I&rsquo;ve seen the scene about a hundred times and it gets me every. damn. time. A simple question could sum up how much she cares for him,-have you ever seen Arya so worried and hurt about something (besides Ned&rsquo;s death because DUH) throughout the season? no. She learned how to control her emotions and literally never show them, but the agony was so visible on her face in that moment. That&rsquo;s not surprising since her friend got taken away to a place she knew nothing about, but again, i&rsquo;ve never seen Arya so furious. She was worried sick and probably was ready to do anything to bring him back.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><b>Gendry&rsquo;s Jealousy</b></h2><p>Hoo boy. Don\u2019t even get me started. It\u2019s a popular headcanon in the fandom that Gendry is a jealous man when it comes to Arya, but i\u2019d say we could freely call it canon since it\u2019s painfully obvious that he\u2019d kill any other man if he saw them kissing his girl. lol Emphasizing on the scene where Arya was talking about Joaquin; Gendry, visibly startled, literally asks: \u2018you need him?\u2019</p><p>Now obviously he didn\u2019t know why Arya might\u2019ve needed the stranger and that\u2019s one of the reasons he got so uncomfortably surprised. The way Joe acts out the scene, it does seem like Gendry looks very uneasy and actually kind of pissed? rewatch the scene and tell me i\u2019m wrong. Even before getting together the boy wants to make sure he has no competitors and that\u2019s purely because he loves her so much. \u00a0He would obviously never be controlling around Arya, but he would make sure to subtly <strike>but not really</strike> remind everyone that she was very much taken. It\u2019s just how he is. I imagine Arya finding his behavior very cute and just laughing about it every time she\u2019d notice him getting mad because of something so irrelevant. You know Gendry doesn\u2019t actually have any reasons to be jealous, right?</p><p>I don\u2019t know if we get more scenes of Gendry being jealous, but there sure are slight chances of that happening since he\u2019s most likely going to reunite Arya and have tons of screentime with her. At this point i\u2019ve stumbled across more than approximately 5 posts of people mentioning how Maisie and Joe were spotted filming together so i\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re getting something. \u00a0There are lots of expectations but who knows what might happen?</p><h2><b>forgesex2019.</b></h2><p>there has been a theory going around about Gendry and Arya&rsquo;s reunion which i personally really like. It&rsquo;s what they deserve and it&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been craving ever since we got to know them. I think it&rsquo;s a very logical explanation of the end for their relationship. @jj-justwriteit is literally the best at discussing how it could go so it would be great if you&rsquo;d read here headcanons, but i&rsquo;ll talk about it here as well. Lots of other pairs got their moments. They even managed to fit Jonerys and their sex scenes in the last scene, so i have high hopes for this. As my friend exclaimed in one of her posts, forgesex is most likely going to happen which i believe on a high level. So far it&rsquo;s a headcanon, but it will hopefully become canon in the final season. If anyone is still worried about the age difference (which is literally just five years), both of them are grown up, nearly adults. There&rsquo;s literally nothing to worry or argue about since Gendrya isn&rsquo;t the only pair with age difference. Drogo and Daenerys? She was about 14 years old when she lost her virginity but people shipped her with Khal regardless. Gendrya is just pure and completely normal, non toxic. They&rsquo;re very allowed to do whatever they want without it seeming weird. period. Arya isn&rsquo;t a child anymore.The way i personally imagine forgesex is WILD. I mean imagine a Baratheon and a Stark in love, who by the way, haven&rsquo;t seen each other for ages so the passion, love, want all of that building up in them is going to burst into flames and boom. Clothes literally ripped, on the floor, hands on each other and kisses everywhere. It would be the most epic scene any other pair has had. I imagine their reunion would be calm and just full of love at first. It&rsquo;s a clichee thing to describe but Gendry would see her first and softly mutter her name, thought loudly enough for her to hear, Arya would flinch at the familiar voice and swiftly turn around, seeing him. I already know Maisie is going to kill this. She has been great at characterizing Arya&rsquo;s intentions and actions, so when they reunite, it&rsquo;s going to be good. No matter what, it&rsquo;s going to be outstanding. I feel it.I can&rsquo;t WAIT to see Arya, Sansa and Jon meeting Gendry altogether. Imagine the flustered girl trying to hide her blush while Jon, confused attempts to find out how her sister knows Gendry. Sansa would know instantly and jokingly tease Arya later.Back to forgesex, can you imagine them getting some time fo themselves and just going at it. It would be a one big sloppy mess but at the same time for them it&rsquo;d be very special and beautiful. By now Gendry already knows that he&rsquo;s a Baratheon so he allows himself to not hold back, which will be the result of him pining her against a wall and. well, you know the rest. One thing i&rsquo;m absolutely sure about is that Arya would still have to initiate the process and strike first. Gendry notices that yes, she is in fact sure about this and wants the exact same thing, so he would start playing along. Gendry knows he has a gorgeous body, okay. Besides Joe dempsie hasn&rsquo;t been working out for NOTHING. We will get more naked Gendry and it will be for Forgesex.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>i probably missed a lot of details and forgot stuff, so if anyone reads any of this at all, a part two will be added to the whole masterpost! this was just a very quick recap slash analyzing the ship so if anyone wants me to get even more in depth and write all my feelings and predictions, simply let me know.</p><p>a huge thank you to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a>\u00a0 ! you inspired me to even start this masterpost.

In this masterpost i will try my best to list and discuss most of the reasons why it has a huge potential of becoming canon. </p><p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b></p><p><i>in no way shape or form am i going to force someone into believing that they\u2019re going to be a romantic pair in the following season. There\u2019s obviously a possibility of their relationship staying exactly the same; this is purely based on theories and real facts from the show.</i></p><p><i>The masterpost will provide you with information from the show, not the books. In all honesty, George Martin treated the ship more fairly than the show and respectfully gave them way more scenes, so to avoid messing up the whole post, i\u2019m going to be speaking about the show!gendrya. </i></p><p><i>i\u2019m going to be using some very interesting information from the blog of my good pal <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a>. They make some very thoughtful points so definitely check out their blog if you\u2019re up for some great Gendrya discussions. Please keep in mind that there are some things you might have already heard of; and definitely correct me if i get something wrong.</i></p><h2><b>Before meeting each other.</b></h2><p>I think it is best to start from the very beginning, and by that i mean even before Arya and Gendry first met. </p><p>A very interesting theory i\u2019ve been thinking about is Robert Baratheon who is obviously the father of Gendry, telling Ned that they would join their houses with marrying their children.</p><p><i>\u201cI have a son, you have a daughter, we\u2019ll join our houses\u201d</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"393\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"i-am-a-book-thief:cWCa66esRtCxYjZc7T8Yrw:Zcd3Yl2NvOmzK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a6e2718db0c50457062fe7dabb54396/tumblr_ot8s6d1van1u8xl1vo1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"393\"></figure><p>. The first thing you probably think of when reading this is Sansa and Joffrey who were supposed to marry each other and as Robert hoped, join the houses to bring peace. Though we all know how that ended,-Joffrey (who wasn\u2019t even Robert\u2019s son in the first place) ended up dying and Sansa\u2019s future took a whole different path to the point where you\u2019d think her desire for marriage had completely disappeared. This might be them foreshadowing the potential future of Arya and Gendry. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019ll get married, but i am saying that this could simply represent the development of their relationship in a romantic way. It would be sort of ironic to see them getting married since Arya had been strongly against it since the very beginning of the show. that leads us to the noticeable twists game of thrones has,- Ned died in the first season when no one expected him to, Robb didn\u2019t even get the chance to rule Winterfell when half of the fandom was convinced he was going to be the next king, Jon fell in love with daenerys which was not only never mentioned in the books, but was also rushed and happened very quickly (unlike Gendrya who had plenty of time to develop feelings for each other, they practically closed an important chapter of their lives while they were together); that being said, you can never really predict where Arya\u2019s path takes us next. The show always hits us with changes and whether they\u2019re good or bad, they\u2019re often very unexpected. If you ask me, Arya\u2019s story is one of those that has not yet ended and there is exactly that one twist missing that is going to wrap it all up. I believe that \u201ctwist\u201d has something to do with Gendry. All the other questions in her storyline are answered,- she chose to remain her identity and not become no one, she got back to her family and proved she would never betray any of them, she chose to follow her childhood dream and became her own hero. The last part is love, i believe. And Arya will need to figure it out and battle with making important decisions one more time. Their \u201cslow burn\u201d romance as i like to call it has been leading up to that all this time and i\u2019m hoping they will be able to fit it in and drop the bomb in the last season. </p><p>Bringing the attention to Gendry, his purpose and identity is really interesting if you think about it. Let\u2019s go way back and start from the main point of his role in the show. Gendry Waters is the Bastard son of Robert Baratheon, right? That\u2019s very clear when you observe how he acts, how he looks and even talks,-if he had been around earlier the king would instantly recognize him as his bastard kid because Gendry is a perfect definition of the name Baratheon. His appearance - dark, rough looking hair and beautiful blue eyes flawlessly portrays the house. Anyone from Cersei\u2019s children could not even compare to how much Gendry looked like his father. There are countless similarities which you can read more<i><b> </b></i>about<i><b> </b></i>on<b><i> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a> \u2019</i></b>s<b><i> </i></b>blogif you\u2019re interested, but i\u2019m going to swiftly turn back to out main topic to avoid confusion. If you take a minute to observe the plot, the show could\u2019ve been perfectly fine without him. That came out harsh but don\u2019t get me wrong, - i love him to death and he\u2019s one of my favorites, he has in fact done very heroic, important stuff but realistically speaking since he isn\u2019t technically one of the protagonists, Gendry could\u2019ve been easily replaced with any random \u00a0character be it male or female, with someone like Podrick, without messing up the whole story. Instead the author strictly made him to be a bastard son of king Robert who would later meet the princess of Winterfell. See? the puzzle instantly fits. Not to mention that there were quite a few characters similar to Gendry in the show who died or were very close to dying while despite disappearing for a entire season, the boy still remained alive and received a big development from just a bastard boy who wasn\u2019t even aware of his identity and spent his life serving others, to Gendry, the son of King Robert Baratheon who befriended Arya\u2019s brother a.k.a our future king and placed a huge role in helping the queen make progress in the battle. There are characters that you\u2019d never expect to lose, there are characters that you know will die. but there are also a few people in GOT that have big chances of making it till the end for various different reasons, i think Gendry is one of them. May i mention how they brought him back in the last season and made him play a huge role? The writers would not make Gendry stand out if he didn\u2019t have a future in game of thrones, period. He is important and his story isn\u2019t over so killing him would be BLOODY DUMB. You started his journey and made it more significant than it could\u2019ve been, now it\u2019s your job to respect your own decisions and not act like Gendry was nothing to the show. Like mentioned above, he could\u2019ve been replaced with literally anyone who would be less relevant but noo. It\u2019s\u00a0<i>Gendry Baratheon</i>. As you keep watching the show and analyse his role in Arya\u2019s life, there are so many things about his persona that just make sense. His name makes is easier for me to connect the dots and get to the point which just screams gendrya. and That\u2019s one of the things that convinces me that Gendry is going to pull through this and stay in the show till the end. </p><p>A very significant scene to me is also his first meeting with Jon. Many people were upset because he didn\u2019t mention Arya and i\u2019m not gonna lie at first that left me feeling kind of bitter as well, but after investing into it more i managed to find possible explanations. I like to look at it from the bright side considering that the scene is so much more than just some boys interacting. Gendry\u2019s meeting with Jon was done in a way that strangely seemed too much like Ned and Robert\u2019s and i can bet my whole life that it was done this way on purpose. It didn\u2019t feel too \u201cformal\u201d, serious or tense, which is what you would normally expect since Jon is literally the legal king of the seven kingdoms. remember Ned and Robert meeting in the very first season? It went exactly like Jon and Gendry\u2019s; They started off with a slightly tense atmosphere until shortly after it transformed into them laughing and hugging.\u00a0the chemistry between the characters was undoubtedly there,- they jokingly made fun of each other and instantly got along which speaks a lot about his future relationship with the Starks; name any other character Jon talked to in such a friendly, \u201cdomestic\u201d way as if they had known each other since forever. If Gendry left such a great first impression on Jon, that means there\u2019s a clear possibility of him being in contact with not only him but the others as well. and by others yes, i mainly mean Arya. Why would he want to become good pals with Jon? Because he\u2019s Arya\u2019s brother. He wants to make up for the fact that he was part of the reason they got separated in the first place and get as close to her as possible. As for him mentioning the girl, none of us know what was going on in Gendry\u2019s head and that\u2019s why there are so many thoughts and theories about this. Probably an opinion closest to reality is that as the fandom agrees,- Gendry might\u2019ve thought Arya was dead. Obviously after being seperated for quite a long time plus Arya completely disappearing from Gendry\u2019s life, he would think she wasn\u2019t alive anymore. It seems logical. Even if you don\u2019t agree with that particular version, Gendry never really got a chance to ask about her either. Once he joined the others to help out on their mission, clearly all they were focused on was the duty, therefore i hightly doubt D&amp;D would give us the fanservise and focus on anything else than the white walkers. If you think about it, all they discuss throughout the seventh season is the plan and how to accomplish it. Rescued from serving people he didn\u2019t want to serve at all, Gendry gave it his all to concentrate on correcting his mistakes, which is the best excuse for this situation. He put off any of his personal issues and wishes to devote himself to saving the world legitimately, meaning he never let himself catch a break and did whatever he could to stay right beside Jon. The boy prevented himself from expressing his emotions which is comprehensible,- even if he didn\u2019t think Arya was dead, i reckon Gendry wouldn\u2019t dare to ask about her when it was his first proper interaction with Jon, she was said to be his sister after all and the last thing he would want is to make things uncomfortable and awkward between them. Both reasons are quite coherent, believe whichever you want. His commitment towards Snow perfectly showed how much he cares. Not only about the people, Jon or the world. But how much he cares about helping out someone whose sister meant so much to him.</p><p>Gendry (still) is in the process of realizing that hey, he could be suitable for his highborn lady after all and if they get the confirmation from Jon(or Daenerys) who will probably become the king, there\u2019s no problem in them being together. It\u2019s apparent that Daenerys strongly dislikes Robert, but she was the one trying to prove that the child should not be punished for their parents\u2019 mistakes, which speaks a lot about how she might\u2019ve reacted. By now it\u2019s obvious that she isn\u2019t cruel nor is she stupid. If Gendry and Arya did get together, i personally see no possibilities of Daenerys denying their relationship. Even if by some chance she did, Jon would proceed to convince her to make it happen because he would be perfectly aware of the fact that it could make Arya happy. Besides may i bring this back,- Gendry left a very good impression on him which assures Jon that his sister would not be in any sorts of danger. I firmly believe he trusts him by now. What i\u2019m trying to get across is that in my opinion this just proves that Gendry shares his part of the story with Arya, that\u2019s why they are destinied to end up together. it just makes sense.</p><p>Lets move on to Arya before and after meeting Gendry. Unlike the boy, Arya did get screentime before meeting him since she\u2019s one of the main characters so it\u2019s easier to discuss what changes i spotted in her persona. In the first season, up to until the third one we see a tough little girl dreaming about becoming a warrior and being just like her father. It\u2019s obvious that she did not even want to imagine her and marriage and continouesly denied the idea, even making fun of Sansa for liking Joffrey. I think that\u2019s quite normal and does not mean that she is incapable of falling in love with someone. Arya was very young in the first season, still practically a tiny child so i think it\u2019s not surprising that she thought marriage was stupid. In no way am i saying that she suddenly changed her point of view when she grew up, but Arya had a very strict opinion about even considering liking someone romantically let alone spending her entire life with them and that\u2019s usually how most children think. Arya, around like 11 years old, would never admit anything like that. That\u2019s why i\u2019m now emphasizing on the fact that her behavior and actions drastically changed later on, a very \u00a0good example is her checking out Gendry\u2019s naked torso in the third season which i\u2019m going to discuss more later. This sums up her growth quite well, she went from the kid who was convinced she was never going to dedicate any time to love, to a girl with her first crush. As i mentioned above, her and Sansa could be on the path of switching their roles. Sansa is either going to lose interest in getting married or finally find a good partner for her(which i doubt will happen to be completely honest) and Arya falls in love with Gendry despite starting off with different expectations.\u00a0</p><p>during the time period when her and Gendry got separated, there isn\u2019t many scenes with Arya mentioning him either. Believe me i was hoping for gendrya the whole time as well but just like with his situation, i was able to quickly understand the case. Arya\u2019s storyline throughout season 6 was very important for her to get where she is now. I believe it was essential to make her go through all that stuff to prove a point: It was not for Arya. Besides the way i personally see it is that In the gap between their reunion, there really was no time for them to be mourning over each other\u2019s loss. Arya tried to become someone else and forget everything from her past. It didn\u2019t work out. She failed to become no one for a reason, she decided to keep calling herself Arya Stark for a reason. If her story contained no love,- be it platonic or romantic whatsoever, i don\u2019t think she\u2019d bother to give up so easily OR come back to Winterfell. This may seem like a reach to some people, but for me it makes complete sense,- Arya came back because Joaquin\u2019s path didn\u2019t cross hers. The life she thought was perfect for her didn\u2019t turn out to be suitable at all and i\u2019m glad she was able to realize that early enough. No matter how much she changed, she belonged (still does) to Winterfell from the very beginning, there were certain people in her life that she could not let go. The writers made her change her mind and come back because there was so much more waiting for her there, because that leads us to what comes next.</p><h2><b>other ships</b></h2><p>some people seem to ship Gendry and Arya with other characters and I\u2019m certainly not here to fight them because of that, but for my fellow gendrya stans, i\u2019m going to try and explain why there\u2019s no chances of either of them ending up with someone else. I guess what you could call \u201cthe most popular ships besides gendrya\u201d are sansa and Gendry and Arya and Joaquin. Let\u2019s start with strongly denying the first one.</p><p>I don\u2019t know where to even begin because i find it challenging to comprehend what gave people reasons to ship Sansa with Gendry. On a very simple note,-they haven\u2019t even met. They have NOT interacted while Gendrya has had a major build up since the third season. When it is seemingly clear that both of them started gradually developing feelings for each other, i can\u2019t imagine Sansa proceeding to literally betray her sister and try to steal her man, lol. She grew up, became more mature and as i mentioned earlier, probably lost a big part of her interest in romance. I personally can only imagine Sansa hyping up their relationship and teasing Arya about how in love she is. Hear me out,- the writers have made tons of questionable decisions throughout the years of shooting the series, but i believe this is where they cross the border. They are perfectly aware of the fact that making Sansa and Gendry canon would stir up drama, not only because people ship gendrya, but also because it does not make sense. It would be wrong, rushed and very, very weird turn. Gendry has never expressed any interest in Sansa nor has he even metioned her.</p><p>As for Joaquin and Arya, i think i am able to get why people like the pair, though in no way do i encourage anyone to do so because it will never happen, obviously. Do i believe that Arya loved Joaquin? No. I personally see them as two individuals who had a very weird friendship connecting them. Arya never really had friends and Joaquin was one of the first people she dared to refer to as such, so of course she would be shown expressing some type of platonic feelings towards him, for instance her choosing him as her teacher or that one time she genuinely got scared, thinking he had died. Joaquin and Arya\u2019s friendship was one big rollercoaster which i\u2019m struggling to fully figure out to this day. Probably the only aspect i\u2019m completely sure about is that they weren\u2019t in love. Both of them knew they had found someone with similar goals and personality so obviously they were left on good terms and managed to even work together for some time. Joaquin taught Arya stuff that gave her a different view on certain stuff and more experience which came out quite useful in the following episodes. The two of them were never destined to be together and Joaquin\u2019s death was one of the things that proved that. Almost every pair in Game of thrones has a mutual connection, great chemistry and are visibly suitable for each other, however Arya and Joaquin never had that. There was not a bit romance in their scenes and they had no development in that terms whatsoever.</p><p>We already know Gendry has eyes on Arya and only.</p><p>That being said, anyone can ship what they want, but once again,-this is for gendrya shippers who think that either of the ships mentioned above have any potential of becoming canon. No they don\u2019t. I\u2019m pretty positive that the author and the creators of the show would never do that to us.</p><h2><b>Their scenes</b></h2><p>As mentioned in the top of this post, George Martin spoiled us and included quite a few moments of Gendrya in the books. If you\u2019ve read the series there\u2019s NO way you didn\u2019t interpret their relationship as a romantic one just because it\u2019s clearly coded that way. Like i promised i\u2019m not going to be going in details about why George is amazing, but it will surely take more effort to analyse the moments from the show untill i manage to get every detail of like the three scenes we got written down and examined. </p><p>Starting from the very first scene we saw them together in. I have so many thoughts about it. We all know Arya and Gendry are incredibly badass together or separated and that scene was a very good example of how well they work together. The bull and the wolf,-they\u2019re a perfect team and it seems as if the writers wanted to get that across immediately once they had met.</p><p>I adore the first scene. Arya gains the courage to stand up for herself despite two strangers probably scaring the shit out of her trapped at a place she knows nothing about. As she finds the energy within herself to stand up and point Needle towards hotpie\u2019s chin, forcing him to steadily step back, Gendry joins from behind and threatens the boy to leave Arya alone. What i love the most about the scene is Gendry\u2019s bitter words mixed with humor (*insert his sentence here*) and the way he defended the innocent kid. It already gives you a general idea of how lovely and courageous his personality is, leaving the best first impression for a character if you ask me. The scene is done so well in the show, he doesn\u2019t even think twice before scolding hotpie and shrugging it off shortly, treating Arya quite decently.\u00a0 As if he already knew he was dealing with a princess.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"310\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"ivorybxlton:G6ZE4HPjIXvJpAu8p3-3Rw:ZbEjPj2BKSkfQ\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2c6b696e9c394ce00f3d9459d252b90/tumblr_ocm1dbIeE11ugi1dio1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"310\"></figure><p><i>look at them.</i></p><p>Now this is a tricky thing to discuss, though one of my personal headcannons that can potentially be very true, is that show!Gendry knew Arya was a girl from that exact scene. What i mean is that he didn\u2019t even need to try and figure it out since he knew in the first place, while others were confused even after finding out she wasn\u2019t a boy. \u00a0<i>\u201cdo you think i\u2019m as stupid as the rest of them?</i>\u201d he says once he sees her surprised face after admitting that Arya had done a poor job lying to him; and it\u2019s true, he isn\u2019t. Gendry is incredibly smart despite not being perfect at reading and writing which by the way, was not his fault at all. Every scene with Gendry in it in the show truly does make him seem more intelligent and clever than the people he mentioned. It speaks a lot about his difference from the other boys and really makes him stand out; also adds another reason to the list of why they\u2019d be a perfect pair. Despite being raised as a bastard and having to go through so much rough stuff at such a young age, Gendry inherited some of the best traits of a Baratheon and grew up to be a bright man. He is quite strong and fit physically, but he is also competent and wise which if you ask me, makes him perfect for Arya. It\u2019s her. There\u2019s no way she would fall in love with someone less cool than her, so i think it\u2019s safe to say that Gendry is the only one right for her. </p><p>Moving onto the scene where he finds out about Arya\u2019s true identity, that one is definitely one of my favorites. There\u2019s so much that needs to be said about it because it describes so many parts of their relationship. It\u2019s a good portrayal of their bond, trust, chemistry.</p><p>I love how Arya didn\u2019t expect him to find out about her at all and tried her best to hide her shocked reaction the first time he confronted her about it. Gendry was very casual and subtle about it, just sliding the topic into their small banter as if it hadn\u2019t even been a huge deal and i find that endearing in a way. It expresses how mature he was at the age of 15, any other boy would most likely freak out and act as if they\u2019d seen a miracle.\u00a0</p><p>Arya could\u2019ve easily rejected him and found more ways to lie in order to convince him otherwise, yet not only did she come clean, but also trusted him enough to admit who she really was. That was an another clear sign of \u201cthey met and instantly found the courage within themselves to trust each other even with their deepest secrets\u201d. Of course the boy was very honest with her as well; \u00a0Tell me Gendry apologizing for peeing in front of her and claiming he should\u2019ve been calling her \u201cM'lady\u201d wasn\u2019t the cutest thing you saw throughout that season. What left me thinking is how he believed her immediately. Sure, Arya\u2019s explanation seemed pretty legit, but i doubt anyone else would let themselves to trust her that easily. He gained much more respect for Arya after finding out that the person he had been talking to wasn\u2019t just any other girl but the highorn lady of Winterfell. I love how Arya is already comfortable with playfully punching the guy because he had called her a lady; and the dialogue in that scene is hilarious and well done. They\u2019re already acting like best friends despite not even knowing each other that much and the apparent flirty tension often gets mixed within their conversations which i find very lovely. It\u2019s so sweet how the angry bean Arya makes Gendry full on giggle and look up at her with the most \u201cin love\u201d look in his eyes. That right there, is good acting.</p><p>I bet Gendry had a hard time hiding \u00a0his shock when finding out that the highborn lady of Winterfell was that badass and fearless instead of a bit more girly and petite as he would\u2019ve expected. And i\u2019m strongly convinced that was the thing about Arya catching his attention and making him realize how different, stronger and better she was than any of the women he had met before.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>One of my absolute favorite scenes is Arya sneakily checking out her man. The scene is so incredibly iconic and remarkable that it most likely popped up in your head instantly. That\u2019s when any viewer immediately realizes that the writers\u2019 intention was to show Arya\u2019s developing first crush.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"aryaxgendrysource:HUI6p2-kSq1FvfPGgW_XiA:ZNzrpg2OuvhfT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9631435cfd2ef5bfd5bc3c16a2fe08df/tumblr_ounqrcfAM01vwdm8yo1_r1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p>As Gendry trains, fully focused on his weapon, Arya literally glances up and down his body with that hungry ass look in her eyes. sorry. had to be said. It\u2019s the truth.\u00a0</p><p>We had definitely never seen the girl impressed on that level by a man in any previous (or following) seasons. Arya was just a tiny girl and as she grew up she started feeling different emotions, therefore i think it\u2019s quite obvious that we got to experience that with her in the said scene. Maisie\u2019s acting was so damn good. She managed to portray the exact same feelings Arya had perfectly which just added more reasons for people to ship the pair.</p><p>The most important scene in my opinion is of course, \u201ci can be your family\u201d. I\u2019m going to begin with firmly emphasizing on Maisie\u2019s comment about the scene.</p><p><b>Rolling stone: she obiously has family on her mind in this episode. But when she tells Gendry \u201ci can be your family\u201d, it sounds like she might mean something very different - even if she herself barely realizes it yet.</b></p><p>I really love the way this was put because they tried to avoid any major spoilers, but gave us higher chances of finding out more about how Arya feels towards Gendry. Bless them for bringing this up. It\u2019s clear that everyone, be it people from the fandom or outside interprets their relatioship as a romantic one.</p><p>Here\u2019s what Maisie answers:</p><p><b>\u201cAt first i read it as \u2019\u2018You can come to winterfell, i\u2019ll show you how everything goes, and you can come and sit at the table with us\u201d, i thought it would be a bit like Theon. But when i was doing the scene, director Alex Graves said \u201cwhen you say that last line, 'i can be your family\u2019, say it like 'i love you\u201d\u2019. And that\u2019s the take that they used.</b></p><p>To this day i\u2019m still struggling to believe that\u2019s real, but it is. Maisie practically said that Arya never saw Gendry as a brother (like Theon) but as something else. Something more. With that exact words she realized she had certain feelings towards Gendry that made it so difficult to let him go and leave. I can\u2019t help but mention their acting one more time because it was absolutely phenomenal. Game Of Thrones has something for every type of viewers, Fantasy, adventure and romance,-that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s so popular. That being said, we\u2019ve had tons of different pairs with their love stories; The ones who ended up dead, the ones who survived. One aspect connecting all of them is the story of how they met and fell in love. Now this is a very bold thing to say so not many people might agree with me, but i personally think that Gendrya, the ship that hasn\u2019t even become canon yet, is the most romantic and epic yet, it leaves us with so much feels and want. I never felt so much love and passion towards any other ship from the show and it\u2019s very apparent to me why. I don\u2019t remember any couple from GOT that had such a slow burn, amorous and well developed plot. Gendrya does. They have so much potential. Both Maisie and Joe understand that and they give it their all to make Gendrya so obvious. In the said scene, Gendry looks like he is legitimately holding back tears as he rejects Arya\u2019s offer and decides to stay. He seems like as if he\u2019s having second thoughts and doubting his choices, there\u2019s so much pain depicted on his face and yet he doesn\u2019t have enough time to reconsider. Maisie does say the last like just like \u201ci love you\u201d. There\u2019s indeed much more said than just \u201ccome to Winterfell and stay with us\u201d, it\u2019s her trying to express unconditional love and fondness. Arya is aware of her feelings towards Gendry and by the time she fully realized that, she had to leave. Just like Gendry, Arya looks just as upset and hurt. Looks like in that moment, \u00a0it took all her willpower to turn around and go.\u00a0</p><p>A classic Gendrya moment is her being immensely worried when the red woman took Gendry, disappearing without any explanations. I can\u2019t get over how mad she got and never stopped worrying about him. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to traitors\u201d CAN YOU BELIEVE HER. Arya was beyond aggrieved to the point where she even refused to talk. Her expression when Gendry gave in and they basically tied him up so he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape was priceless. I\u2019ve seen the scene about a hundred times and it gets me every. damn. time. A simple question could sum up how much she cares for him,-have you ever seen Arya so worried and hurt about something (besides Ned\u2019s death because DUH) throughout the season? no. She learned how to control her emotions and literally never show them, but the agony was so visible on her face in that moment. That\u2019s not surprising since her friend got taken away to a place she knew nothing about, but again, i\u2019ve never seen Arya so furious. She was worried sick and probably was ready to do anything to bring him back.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><b>Gendry\u2019s Jealousy</b></h2><p>Hoo boy. Don\u2019t even get me started. It\u2019s a popular headcanon in the fandom that Gendry is a jealous man when it comes to Arya, but i\u2019d say we could freely call it canon since it\u2019s painfully obvious that he\u2019d kill any other man if he saw them kissing his girl. lol Emphasizing on the scene where Arya was talking about Joaquin; Gendry, visibly startled, literally asks: \u2018you need him?\u2019</p><p>Now obviously he didn\u2019t know why Arya might\u2019ve needed the stranger and that\u2019s one of the reasons he got so uncomfortably surprised. The way Joe acts out the scene, it does seem like Gendry looks very uneasy and actually kind of pissed? rewatch the scene and tell me i\u2019m wrong. Even before getting together the boy wants to make sure he has no competitors and that\u2019s purely because he loves her so much. \u00a0He would obviously never be controlling around Arya, but he would make sure to subtly <strike>but not really</strike> remind everyone that she was very much taken. It\u2019s just how he is. I imagine Arya finding his behavior very cute and just laughing about it every time she\u2019d notice him getting mad because of something so irrelevant. You know Gendry doesn\u2019t actually have any reasons to be jealous, right?</p><p>I don\u2019t know if we get more scenes of Gendry being jealous, but there sure are slight chances of that happening since he\u2019s most likely going to reunite Arya and have tons of screentime with her. At this point i\u2019ve stumbled across more than approximately 5 posts of people mentioning how Maisie and Joe were spotted filming together so i\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re getting something. \u00a0There are lots of expectations but who knows what might happen?</p><h2><b>forgesex2019.</b></h2><p>there has been a theory going around about Gendry and Arya\u2019s reunion which i personally really like. It\u2019s what they deserve and it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been craving ever since we got to know them. I think it\u2019s a very logical explanation of the end for their relationship. @jj-justwriteit is literally the best at discussing how it could go so it would be great if you\u2019d read here headcanons, but i\u2019ll talk about it here as well. Lots of other pairs got their moments. They even managed to fit Jonerys and their sex scenes in the last scene, so i have high hopes for this. As my friend exclaimed in one of her posts, forgesex is most likely going to happen which i believe on a high level. So far it\u2019s a headcanon, but it will hopefully become canon in the final season. If anyone is still worried about the age difference (which is literally just five years), both of them are grown up, nearly adults. There\u2019s literally nothing to worry or argue about since Gendrya isn\u2019t the only pair with age difference. Drogo and Daenerys? She was about 14 years old when she lost her virginity but people shipped her with Khal regardless. Gendrya is just pure and completely normal, non toxic. They\u2019re very allowed to do whatever they want without it seeming weird. period. Arya isn\u2019t a child anymore.The way i personally imagine forgesex is WILD. I mean imagine a Baratheon and a Stark in love, who by the way, haven\u2019t seen each other for ages so the passion, love, want all of that building up in them is going to burst into flames and boom. Clothes literally ripped, on the floor, hands on each other and kisses everywhere. It would be the most epic scene any other pair has had. I imagine their reunion would be calm and just full of love at first. It\u2019s a clichee thing to describe but Gendry would see her first and softly mutter her name, thought loudly enough for her to hear, Arya would flinch at the familiar voice and swiftly turn around, seeing him. I already know Maisie is going to kill this. She has been great at characterizing Arya\u2019s intentions and actions, so when they reunite, it\u2019s going to be good. No matter what, it\u2019s going to be outstanding. I feel it.I can\u2019t WAIT to see Arya, Sansa and Jon meeting Gendry altogether. Imagine the flustered girl trying to hide her blush while Jon, confused attempts to find out how her sister knows Gendry. Sansa would know instantly and jokingly tease Arya later.Back to forgesex, can you imagine them getting some time fo themselves and just going at it. It would be a one big sloppy mess but at the same time for them it\u2019d be very special and beautiful. By now Gendry already knows that he\u2019s a Baratheon so he allows himself to not hold back, which will be the result of him pining her against a wall and. well, you know the rest. One thing i\u2019m absolutely sure about is that Arya would still have to initiate the process and strike first. Gendry notices that yes, she is in fact sure about this and wants the exact same thing, so he would start playing along. Gendry knows he has a gorgeous body, okay. Besides Joe dempsie hasn\u2019t been working out for NOTHING. We will get more naked Gendry and it will be for Forgesex.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>i probably missed a lot of details and forgot stuff, so if anyone reads any of this at all, a part two will be added to the whole masterpost! this was just a very quick recap slash analyzing the ship so if anyone wants me to get even more in depth and write all my feelings and predictions, simply let me know.</p><p>a huge thank you to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a>\u00a0 ! you inspired me to even start this masterpost.

In this masterpost i will try my best to list and discuss most of the reasons why it has a huge potential of becoming canon. </p><p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b></p><p><i>in no way shape or form am i going to force someone into believing that they\u2019re going to be a romantic pair in the following season. There\u2019s obviously a possibility of their relationship staying exactly the same; this is purely based on theories and real facts from the show.</i></p><p><i>The masterpost will provide you with information from the show, not the books. In all honesty, George Martin treated the ship more fairly than the show and respectfully gave them way more scenes, so to avoid messing up the whole post, i\u2019m going to be speaking about the show!gendrya. </i></p><p><i>i\u2019m going to be using some very interesting information from the blog of my good pal <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a>. They make some very thoughtful points so definitely check out their blog if you\u2019re up for some great Gendrya discussions. Please keep in mind that there are some things you might have already heard of; and definitely correct me if i get something wrong.</i></p><h2><b>Before meeting each other.</b></h2><p>I think it is best to start from the very beginning, and by that i mean even before Arya and Gendry first met. </p><p>A very interesting theory i\u2019ve been thinking about is Robert Baratheon who is obviously the father of Gendry, telling Ned that they would join their houses with marrying their children.</p><p><i>\u201cI have a son, you have a daughter, we\u2019ll join our houses\u201d</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"393\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"i-am-a-book-thief:cWCa66esRtCxYjZc7T8Yrw:Zcd3Yl2NvOmzK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a6e2718db0c50457062fe7dabb54396/tumblr_ot8s6d1van1u8xl1vo1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"393\"></figure><p>. The first thing you probably think of when reading this is Sansa and Joffrey who were supposed to marry each other and as Robert hoped, join the houses to bring peace. Though we all know how that ended,-Joffrey (who wasn\u2019t even Robert\u2019s son in the first place) ended up dying and Sansa\u2019s future took a whole different path to the point where you\u2019d think her desire for marriage had completely disappeared. This might be them foreshadowing the potential future of Arya and Gendry. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019ll get married, but i am saying that this could simply represent the development of their relationship in a romantic way. It would be sort of ironic to see them getting married since Arya had been strongly against it since the very beginning of the show. that leads us to the noticeable twists game of thrones has,- Ned died in the first season when no one expected him to, Robb didn\u2019t even get the chance to rule Winterfell when half of the fandom was convinced he was going to be the next king, Jon fell in love with daenerys which was not only never mentioned in the books, but was also rushed and happened very quickly (unlike Gendrya who had plenty of time to develop feelings for each other, they practically closed an important chapter of their lives while they were together); that being said, you can never really predict where Arya\u2019s path takes us next. The show always hits us with changes and whether they\u2019re good or bad, they\u2019re often very unexpected. If you ask me, Arya\u2019s story is one of those that has not yet ended and there is exactly that one twist missing that is going to wrap it all up. I believe that \u201ctwist\u201d has something to do with Gendry. All the other questions in her storyline are answered,- she chose to remain her identity and not become no one, she got back to her family and proved she would never betray any of them, she chose to follow her childhood dream and became her own hero. The last part is love, i believe. And Arya will need to figure it out and battle with making important decisions one more time. Their \u201cslow burn\u201d romance as i like to call it has been leading up to that all this time and i\u2019m hoping they will be able to fit it in and drop the bomb in the last season. </p><p>Bringing the attention to Gendry, his purpose and identity is really interesting if you think about it. Let\u2019s go way back and start from the main point of his role in the show. Gendry Waters is the Bastard son of Robert Baratheon, right? That\u2019s very clear when you observe how he acts, how he looks and even talks,-if he had been around earlier the king would instantly recognize him as his bastard kid because Gendry is a perfect definition of the name Baratheon. His appearance - dark, rough looking hair and beautiful blue eyes flawlessly portrays the house. Anyone from Cersei\u2019s children could not even compare to how much Gendry looked like his father. There are countless similarities which you can read more<i><b> </b></i>about<i><b> </b></i>on<b><i> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a> \u2019</i></b>s<b><i> </i></b>blogif you\u2019re interested, but i\u2019m going to swiftly turn back to out main topic to avoid confusion. If you take a minute to observe the plot, the show could\u2019ve been perfectly fine without him. That came out harsh but don\u2019t get me wrong, - i love him to death and he\u2019s one of my favorites, he has in fact done very heroic, important stuff but realistically speaking since he isn\u2019t technically one of the protagonists, Gendry could\u2019ve been easily replaced with any random \u00a0character be it male or female, with someone like Podrick, without messing up the whole story. Instead the author strictly made him to be a bastard son of king Robert who would later meet the princess of Winterfell. See? the puzzle instantly fits. Not to mention that there were quite a few characters similar to Gendry in the show who died or were very close to dying while despite disappearing for a entire season, the boy still remained alive and received a big development from just a bastard boy who wasn\u2019t even aware of his identity and spent his life serving others, to Gendry, the son of King Robert Baratheon who befriended Arya\u2019s brother a.k.a our future king and placed a huge role in helping the queen make progress in the battle. There are characters that you\u2019d never expect to lose, there are characters that you know will die. but there are also a few people in GOT that have big chances of making it till the end for various different reasons, i think Gendry is one of them. May i mention how they brought him back in the last season and made him play a huge role? The writers would not make Gendry stand out if he didn\u2019t have a future in game of thrones, period. He is important and his story isn\u2019t over so killing him would be BLOODY DUMB. You started his journey and made it more significant than it could\u2019ve been, now it\u2019s your job to respect your own decisions and not act like Gendry was nothing to the show. Like mentioned above, he could\u2019ve been replaced with literally anyone who would be less relevant but noo. It\u2019s\u00a0<i>Gendry Baratheon</i>. As you keep watching the show and analyse his role in Arya\u2019s life, there are so many things about his persona that just make sense. His name makes is easier for me to connect the dots and get to the point which just screams gendrya. and That\u2019s one of the things that convinces me that Gendry is going to pull through this and stay in the show till the end. </p><p>A very significant scene to me is also his first meeting with Jon. Many people were upset because he didn\u2019t mention Arya and i\u2019m not gonna lie at first that left me feeling kind of bitter as well, but after investing into it more i managed to find possible explanations. I like to look at it from the bright side considering that the scene is so much more than just some boys interacting. Gendry\u2019s meeting with Jon was done in a way that strangely seemed too much like Ned and Robert\u2019s and i can bet my whole life that it was done this way on purpose. It didn\u2019t feel too \u201cformal\u201d, serious or tense, which is what you would normally expect since Jon is literally the legal king of the seven kingdoms. remember Ned and Robert meeting in the very first season? It went exactly like Jon and Gendry\u2019s; They started off with a slightly tense atmosphere until shortly after it transformed into them laughing and hugging.\u00a0the chemistry between the characters was undoubtedly there,- they jokingly made fun of each other and instantly got along which speaks a lot about his future relationship with the Starks; name any other character Jon talked to in such a friendly, \u201cdomestic\u201d way as if they had known each other since forever. If Gendry left such a great first impression on Jon, that means there\u2019s a clear possibility of him being in contact with not only him but the others as well. and by others yes, i mainly mean Arya. Why would he want to become good pals with Jon? Because he\u2019s Arya\u2019s brother. He wants to make up for the fact that he was part of the reason they got separated in the first place and get as close to her as possible. As for him mentioning the girl, none of us know what was going on in Gendry\u2019s head and that\u2019s why there are so many thoughts and theories about this. Probably an opinion closest to reality is that as the fandom agrees,- Gendry might\u2019ve thought Arya was dead. Obviously after being seperated for quite a long time plus Arya completely disappearing from Gendry\u2019s life, he would think she wasn\u2019t alive anymore. It seems logical. Even if you don\u2019t agree with that particular version, Gendry never really got a chance to ask about her either. Once he joined the others to help out on their mission, clearly all they were focused on was the duty, therefore i hightly doubt D&amp;D would give us the fanservise and focus on anything else than the white walkers. If you think about it, all they discuss throughout the seventh season is the plan and how to accomplish it. Rescued from serving people he didn\u2019t want to serve at all, Gendry gave it his all to concentrate on correcting his mistakes, which is the best excuse for this situation. He put off any of his personal issues and wishes to devote himself to saving the world legitimately, meaning he never let himself catch a break and did whatever he could to stay right beside Jon. The boy prevented himself from expressing his emotions which is comprehensible,- even if he didn\u2019t think Arya was dead, i reckon Gendry wouldn\u2019t dare to ask about her when it was his first proper interaction with Jon, she was said to be his sister after all and the last thing he would want is to make things uncomfortable and awkward between them. Both reasons are quite coherent, believe whichever you want. His commitment towards Snow perfectly showed how much he cares. Not only about the people, Jon or the world. But how much he cares about helping out someone whose sister meant so much to him.</p><p>Gendry (still) is in the process of realizing that hey, he could be suitable for his highborn lady after all and if they get the confirmation from Jon(or Daenerys) who will probably become the king, there\u2019s no problem in them being together. It\u2019s apparent that Daenerys strongly dislikes Robert, but she was the one trying to prove that the child should not be punished for their parents\u2019 mistakes, which speaks a lot about how she might\u2019ve reacted. By now it\u2019s obvious that she isn\u2019t cruel nor is she stupid. If Gendry and Arya did get together, i personally see no possibilities of Daenerys denying their relationship. Even if by some chance she did, Jon would proceed to convince her to make it happen because he would be perfectly aware of the fact that it could make Arya happy. Besides may i bring this back,- Gendry left a very good impression on him which assures Jon that his sister would not be in any sorts of danger. I firmly believe he trusts him by now. What i\u2019m trying to get across is that in my opinion this just proves that Gendry shares his part of the story with Arya, that\u2019s why they are destinied to end up together. it just makes sense.</p><p>Lets move on to Arya before and after meeting Gendry. Unlike the boy, Arya did get screentime before meeting him since she\u2019s one of the main characters so it\u2019s easier to discuss what changes i spotted in her persona. In the first season, up to until the third one we see a tough little girl dreaming about becoming a warrior and being just like her father. It\u2019s obvious that she did not even want to imagine her and marriage and continouesly denied the idea, even making fun of Sansa for liking Joffrey. I think that\u2019s quite normal and does not mean that she is incapable of falling in love with someone. Arya was very young in the first season, still practically a tiny child so i think it\u2019s not surprising that she thought marriage was stupid. In no way am i saying that she suddenly changed her point of view when she grew up, but Arya had a very strict opinion about even considering liking someone romantically let alone spending her entire life with them and that\u2019s usually how most children think. Arya, around like 11 years old, would never admit anything like that. That\u2019s why i\u2019m now emphasizing on the fact that her behavior and actions drastically changed later on, a very \u00a0good example is her checking out Gendry\u2019s naked torso in the third season which i\u2019m going to discuss more later. This sums up her growth quite well, she went from the kid who was convinced she was never going to dedicate any time to love, to a girl with her first crush. As i mentioned above, her and Sansa could be on the path of switching their roles. Sansa is either going to lose interest in getting married or finally find a good partner for her(which i doubt will happen to be completely honest) and Arya falls in love with Gendry despite starting off with different expectations.\u00a0</p><p>during the time period when her and Gendry got separated, there isn\u2019t many scenes with Arya mentioning him either. Believe me i was hoping for gendrya the whole time as well but just like with his situation, i was able to quickly understand the case. Arya\u2019s storyline throughout season 6 was very important for her to get where she is now. I believe it was essential to make her go through all that stuff to prove a point: It was not for Arya. Besides the way i personally see it is that In the gap between their reunion, there really was no time for them to be mourning over each other\u2019s loss. Arya tried to become someone else and forget everything from her past. It didn\u2019t work out. She failed to become no one for a reason, she decided to keep calling herself Arya Stark for a reason. If her story contained no love,- be it platonic or romantic whatsoever, i don\u2019t think she\u2019d bother to give up so easily OR come back to Winterfell. This may seem like a reach to some people, but for me it makes complete sense,- Arya came back because Joaquin\u2019s path didn\u2019t cross hers. The life she thought was perfect for her didn\u2019t turn out to be suitable at all and i\u2019m glad she was able to realize that early enough. No matter how much she changed, she belonged (still does) to Winterfell from the very beginning, there were certain people in her life that she could not let go. The writers made her change her mind and come back because there was so much more waiting for her there, because that leads us to what comes next.</p><h2><b>other ships</b></h2><p>some people seem to ship Gendry and Arya with other characters and I\u2019m certainly not here to fight them because of that, but for my fellow gendrya stans, i\u2019m going to try and explain why there\u2019s no chances of either of them ending up with someone else. I guess what you could call \u201cthe most popular ships besides gendrya\u201d are sansa and Gendry and Arya and Joaquin. Let\u2019s start with strongly denying the first one.</p><p>I don\u2019t know where to even begin because i find it challenging to comprehend what gave people reasons to ship Sansa with Gendry. On a very simple note,-they haven\u2019t even met. They have NOT interacted while Gendrya has had a major build up since the third season. When it is seemingly clear that both of them started gradually developing feelings for each other, i can\u2019t imagine Sansa proceeding to literally betray her sister and try to steal her man, lol. She grew up, became more mature and as i mentioned earlier, probably lost a big part of her interest in romance. I personally can only imagine Sansa hyping up their relationship and teasing Arya about how in love she is. Hear me out,- the writers have made tons of questionable decisions throughout the years of shooting the series, but i believe this is where they cross the border. They are perfectly aware of the fact that making Sansa and Gendry canon would stir up drama, not only because people ship gendrya, but also because it does not make sense. It would be wrong, rushed and very, very weird turn. Gendry has never expressed any interest in Sansa nor has he even metioned her.</p><p>As for Joaquin and Arya, i think i am able to get why people like the pair, though in no way do i encourage anyone to do so because it will never happen, obviously. Do i believe that Arya loved Joaquin? No. I personally see them as two individuals who had a very weird friendship connecting them. Arya never really had friends and Joaquin was one of the first people she dared to refer to as such, so of course she would be shown expressing some type of platonic feelings towards him, for instance her choosing him as her teacher or that one time she genuinely got scared, thinking he had died. Joaquin and Arya\u2019s friendship was one big rollercoaster which i\u2019m struggling to fully figure out to this day. Probably the only aspect i\u2019m completely sure about is that they weren\u2019t in love. Both of them knew they had found someone with similar goals and personality so obviously they were left on good terms and managed to even work together for some time. Joaquin taught Arya stuff that gave her a different view on certain stuff and more experience which came out quite useful in the following episodes. The two of them were never destined to be together and Joaquin\u2019s death was one of the things that proved that. Almost every pair in Game of thrones has a mutual connection, great chemistry and are visibly suitable for each other, however Arya and Joaquin never had that. There was not a bit romance in their scenes and they had no development in that terms whatsoever.</p><p>We already know Gendry has eyes on Arya and only.</p><p>That being said, anyone can ship what they want, but once again,-this is for gendrya shippers who think that either of the ships mentioned above have any potential of becoming canon. No they don\u2019t. I\u2019m pretty positive that the author and the creators of the show would never do that to us.</p><h2><b>Their scenes</b></h2><p>As mentioned in the top of this post, George Martin spoiled us and included quite a few moments of Gendrya in the books. If you\u2019ve read the series there\u2019s NO way you didn\u2019t interpret their relationship as a romantic one just because it\u2019s clearly coded that way. Like i promised i\u2019m not going to be going in details about why George is amazing, but it will surely take more effort to analyse the moments from the show untill i manage to get every detail of like the three scenes we got written down and examined. </p><p>Starting from the very first scene we saw them together in. I have so many thoughts about it. We all know Arya and Gendry are incredibly badass together or separated and that scene was a very good example of how well they work together. The bull and the wolf,-they\u2019re a perfect team and it seems as if the writers wanted to get that across immediately once they had met.</p><p>I adore the first scene. Arya gains the courage to stand up for herself despite two strangers probably scaring the shit out of her trapped at a place she knows nothing about. As she finds the energy within herself to stand up and point Needle towards hotpie\u2019s chin, forcing him to steadily step back, Gendry joins from behind and threatens the boy to leave Arya alone. What i love the most about the scene is Gendry\u2019s bitter words mixed with humor (*insert his sentence here*) and the way he defended the innocent kid. It already gives you a general idea of how lovely and courageous his personality is, leaving the best first impression for a character if you ask me. The scene is done so well in the show, he doesn\u2019t even think twice before scolding hotpie and shrugging it off shortly, treating Arya quite decently.\u00a0 As if he already knew he was dealing with a princess.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"310\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"ivorybxlton:G6ZE4HPjIXvJpAu8p3-3Rw:ZbEjPj2BKSkfQ\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2c6b696e9c394ce00f3d9459d252b90/tumblr_ocm1dbIeE11ugi1dio1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"310\"></figure><p><i>look at them.</i></p><p>Now this is a tricky thing to discuss, though one of my personal headcannons that can potentially be very true, is that show!Gendry knew Arya was a girl from that exact scene. What i mean is that he didn\u2019t even need to try and figure it out since he knew in the first place, while others were confused even after finding out she wasn\u2019t a boy. \u00a0<i>\u201cdo you think i\u2019m as stupid as the rest of them?</i>\u201d he says once he sees her surprised face after admitting that Arya had done a poor job lying to him; and it\u2019s true, he isn\u2019t. Gendry is incredibly smart despite not being perfect at reading and writing which by the way, was not his fault at all. Every scene with Gendry in it in the show truly does make him seem more intelligent and clever than the people he mentioned. It speaks a lot about his difference from the other boys and really makes him stand out; also adds another reason to the list of why they\u2019d be a perfect pair. Despite being raised as a bastard and having to go through so much rough stuff at such a young age, Gendry inherited some of the best traits of a Baratheon and grew up to be a bright man. He is quite strong and fit physically, but he is also competent and wise which if you ask me, makes him perfect for Arya. It\u2019s her. There\u2019s no way she would fall in love with someone less cool than her, so i think it\u2019s safe to say that Gendry is the only one right for her. </p><p>Moving onto the scene where he finds out about Arya\u2019s true identity, that one is definitely one of my favorites. There\u2019s so much that needs to be said about it because it describes so many parts of their relationship. It\u2019s a good portrayal of their bond, trust, chemistry.</p><p>I love how Arya didn\u2019t expect him to find out about her at all and tried her best to hide her shocked reaction the first time he confronted her about it. Gendry was very casual and subtle about it, just sliding the topic into their small banter as if it hadn\u2019t even been a huge deal and i find that endearing in a way. It expresses how mature he was at the age of 15, any other boy would most likely freak out and act as if they\u2019d seen a miracle.\u00a0</p><p>Arya could\u2019ve easily rejected him and found more ways to lie in order to convince him otherwise, yet not only did she come clean, but also trusted him enough to admit who she really was. That was an another clear sign of \u201cthey met and instantly found the courage within themselves to trust each other even with their deepest secrets\u201d. Of course the boy was very honest with her as well; \u00a0Tell me Gendry apologizing for peeing in front of her and claiming he should\u2019ve been calling her \u201cM'lady\u201d wasn\u2019t the cutest thing you saw throughout that season. What left me thinking is how he believed her immediately. Sure, Arya\u2019s explanation seemed pretty legit, but i doubt anyone else would let themselves to trust her that easily. He gained much more respect for Arya after finding out that the person he had been talking to wasn\u2019t just any other girl but the highorn lady of Winterfell. I love how Arya is already comfortable with playfully punching the guy because he had called her a lady; and the dialogue in that scene is hilarious and well done. They\u2019re already acting like best friends despite not even knowing each other that much and the apparent flirty tension often gets mixed within their conversations which i find very lovely. It\u2019s so sweet how the angry bean Arya makes Gendry full on giggle and look up at her with the most \u201cin love\u201d look in his eyes. That right there, is good acting.</p><p>I bet Gendry had a hard time hiding \u00a0his shock when finding out that the highborn lady of Winterfell was that badass and fearless instead of a bit more girly and petite as he would\u2019ve expected. And i\u2019m strongly convinced that was the thing about Arya catching his attention and making him realize how different, stronger and better she was than any of the women he had met before.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>One of my absolute favorite scenes is Arya sneakily checking out her man. The scene is so incredibly iconic and remarkable that it most likely popped up in your head instantly. That\u2019s when any viewer immediately realizes that the writers\u2019 intention was to show Arya\u2019s developing first crush.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"aryaxgendrysource:HUI6p2-kSq1FvfPGgW_XiA:ZNzrpg2OuvhfT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9631435cfd2ef5bfd5bc3c16a2fe08df/tumblr_ounqrcfAM01vwdm8yo1_r1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p>As Gendry trains, fully focused on his weapon, Arya literally glances up and down his body with that hungry ass look in her eyes. sorry. had to be said. It\u2019s the truth.\u00a0</p><p>We had definitely never seen the girl impressed on that level by a man in any previous (or following) seasons. Arya was just a tiny girl and as she grew up she started feeling different emotions, therefore i think it\u2019s quite obvious that we got to experience that with her in the said scene. Maisie\u2019s acting was so damn good. She managed to portray the exact same feelings Arya had perfectly which just added more reasons for people to ship the pair.</p><p>The most important scene in my opinion is of course, \u201ci can be your family\u201d. I\u2019m going to begin with firmly emphasizing on Maisie\u2019s comment about the scene.</p><p><b>Rolling stone: she obiously has family on her mind in this episode. But when she tells Gendry \u201ci can be your family\u201d, it sounds like she might mean something very different - even if she herself barely realizes it yet.</b></p><p>I really love the way this was put because they tried to avoid any major spoilers, but gave us higher chances of finding out more about how Arya feels towards Gendry. Bless them for bringing this up. It\u2019s clear that everyone, be it people from the fandom or outside interprets their relatioship as a romantic one.</p><p>Here\u2019s what Maisie answers:</p><p><b>\u201cAt first i read it as \u2019\u2018You can come to winterfell, i\u2019ll show you how everything goes, and you can come and sit at the table with us\u201d, i thought it would be a bit like Theon. But when i was doing the scene, director Alex Graves said \u201cwhen you say that last line, 'i can be your family\u2019, say it like 'i love you\u201d\u2019. And that\u2019s the take that they used.</b></p><p>To this day i\u2019m still struggling to believe that\u2019s real, but it is. Maisie practically said that Arya never saw Gendry as a brother (like Theon) but as something else. Something more. With that exact words she realized she had certain feelings towards Gendry that made it so difficult to let him go and leave. I can\u2019t help but mention their acting one more time because it was absolutely phenomenal. Game Of Thrones has something for every type of viewers, Fantasy, adventure and romance,-that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s so popular. That being said, we\u2019ve had tons of different pairs with their love stories; The ones who ended up dead, the ones who survived. One aspect connecting all of them is the story of how they met and fell in love. Now this is a very bold thing to say so not many people might agree with me, but i personally think that Gendrya, the ship that hasn\u2019t even become canon yet, is the most romantic and epic yet, it leaves us with so much feels and want. I never felt so much love and passion towards any other ship from the show and it\u2019s very apparent to me why. I don\u2019t remember any couple from GOT that had such a slow burn, amorous and well developed plot. Gendrya does. They have so much potential. Both Maisie and Joe understand that and they give it their all to make Gendrya so obvious. In the said scene, Gendry looks like he is legitimately holding back tears as he rejects Arya\u2019s offer and decides to stay. He seems like as if he\u2019s having second thoughts and doubting his choices, there\u2019s so much pain depicted on his face and yet he doesn\u2019t have enough time to reconsider. Maisie does say the last like just like \u201ci love you\u201d. There\u2019s indeed much more said than just \u201ccome to Winterfell and stay with us\u201d, it\u2019s her trying to express unconditional love and fondness. Arya is aware of her feelings towards Gendry and by the time she fully realized that, she had to leave. Just like Gendry, Arya looks just as upset and hurt. Looks like in that moment, \u00a0it took all her willpower to turn around and go.\u00a0</p><p>A classic Gendrya moment is her being immensely worried when the red woman took Gendry, disappearing without any explanations. I can\u2019t get over how mad she got and never stopped worrying about him. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to traitors\u201d CAN YOU BELIEVE HER. Arya was beyond aggrieved to the point where she even refused to talk. Her expression when Gendry gave in and they basically tied him up so he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape was priceless. I\u2019ve seen the scene about a hundred times and it gets me every. damn. time. A simple question could sum up how much she cares for him,-have you ever seen Arya so worried and hurt about something (besides Ned\u2019s death because DUH) throughout the season? no. She learned how to control her emotions and literally never show them, but the agony was so visible on her face in that moment. That\u2019s not surprising since her friend got taken away to a place she knew nothing about, but again, i\u2019ve never seen Arya so furious. She was worried sick and probably was ready to do anything to bring him back.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><b>Gendry\u2019s Jealousy</b></h2><p>Hoo boy. Don\u2019t even get me started. It\u2019s a popular headcanon in the fandom that Gendry is a jealous man when it comes to Arya, but i\u2019d say we could freely call it canon since it\u2019s painfully obvious that he\u2019d kill any other man if he saw them kissing his girl. lol Emphasizing on the scene where Arya was talking about Joaquin; Gendry, visibly startled, literally asks: \u2018you need him?\u2019</p><p>Now obviously he didn\u2019t know why Arya might\u2019ve needed the stranger and that\u2019s one of the reasons he got so uncomfortably surprised. The way Joe acts out the scene, it does seem like Gendry looks very uneasy and actually kind of pissed? rewatch the scene and tell me i\u2019m wrong. Even before getting together the boy wants to make sure he has no competitors and that\u2019s purely because he loves her so much. \u00a0He would obviously never be controlling around Arya, but he would make sure to subtly <strike>but not really</strike> remind everyone that she was very much taken. It\u2019s just how he is. I imagine Arya finding his behavior very cute and just laughing about it every time she\u2019d notice him getting mad because of something so irrelevant. You know Gendry doesn\u2019t actually have any reasons to be jealous, right?</p><p>I don\u2019t know if we get more scenes of Gendry being jealous, but there sure are slight chances of that happening since he\u2019s most likely going to reunite Arya and have tons of screentime with her. At this point i\u2019ve stumbled across more than approximately 5 posts of people mentioning how Maisie and Joe were spotted filming together so i\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re getting something. \u00a0There are lots of expectations but who knows what might happen?</p><h2><b>forgesex2019.</b></h2><p>there has been a theory going around about Gendry and Arya\u2019s reunion which i personally really like. It\u2019s what they deserve and it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been craving ever since we got to know them. I think it\u2019s a very logical explanation of the end for their relationship. @jj-justwriteit is literally the best at discussing how it could go so it would be great if you\u2019d read here headcanons, but i\u2019ll talk about it here as well. Lots of other pairs got their moments. They even managed to fit Jonerys and their sex scenes in the last scene, so i have high hopes for this. As my friend exclaimed in one of her posts, forgesex is most likely going to happen which i believe on a high level. So far it\u2019s a headcanon, but it will hopefully become canon in the final season. If anyone is still worried about the age difference (which is literally just five years), both of them are grown up, nearly adults. There\u2019s literally nothing to worry or argue about since Gendrya isn\u2019t the only pair with age difference. Drogo and Daenerys? She was about 14 years old when she lost her virginity but people shipped her with Khal regardless. Gendrya is just pure and completely normal, non toxic. They\u2019re very allowed to do whatever they want without it seeming weird. period. Arya isn\u2019t a child anymore.The way i personally imagine forgesex is WILD. I mean imagine a Baratheon and a Stark in love, who by the way, haven\u2019t seen each other for ages so the passion, love, want all of that building up in them is going to burst into flames and boom. Clothes literally ripped, on the floor, hands on each other and kisses everywhere. It would be the most epic scene any other pair has had. I imagine their reunion would be calm and just full of love at first. It\u2019s a clichee thing to describe but Gendry would see her first and softly mutter her name, thought loudly enough for her to hear, Arya would flinch at the familiar voice and swiftly turn around, seeing him. I already know Maisie is going to kill this. She has been great at characterizing Arya\u2019s intentions and actions, so when they reunite, it\u2019s going to be good. No matter what, it\u2019s going to be outstanding. I feel it.I can\u2019t WAIT to see Arya, Sansa and Jon meeting Gendry altogether. Imagine the flustered girl trying to hide her blush while Jon, confused attempts to find out how her sister knows Gendry. Sansa would know instantly and jokingly tease Arya later.Back to forgesex, can you imagine them getting some time fo themselves and just going at it. It would be a one big sloppy mess but at the same time for them it\u2019d be very special and beautiful. By now Gendry already knows that he\u2019s a Baratheon so he allows himself to not hold back, which will be the result of him pining her against a wall and. well, you know the rest. One thing i\u2019m absolutely sure about is that Arya would still have to initiate the process and strike first. Gendry notices that yes, she is in fact sure about this and wants the exact same thing, so he would start playing along. Gendry knows he has a gorgeous body, okay. Besides Joe dempsie hasn\u2019t been working out for NOTHING. We will get more naked Gendry and it will be for Forgesex.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>i probably missed a lot of details and forgot stuff, so if anyone reads any of this at all, a part two will be added to the whole masterpost! this was just a very quick recap slash analyzing the ship so if anyone wants me to get even more in depth and write all my feelings and predictions, simply let me know.</p><p>a huge thank you to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a>\u00a0 ! you inspired me to even start this masterpost.

                "content": "<p><h1>Gendrya and its chances of becoming canon - part 1</h1><p><b>this post contains spoilers from most of the seasons of Game Of Thrones</b></p><p>Gendrya, also known as the shipname of Arya stark and Gendry Baratheon, has become a quite popular pair in our fandom. In this masterpost i will try my best to list and discuss most of the reasons why it has a huge potential of becoming canon. </p><p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b></p><p><i>in no way shape or form am i going to force someone into believing that they&rsquo;re going to be a romantic pair in the following season. There&rsquo;s obviously a possibility of their relationship staying exactly the same; this is purely based on theories and real facts from the show.</i></p><p><i>The masterpost will provide you with information from the show, not the books. In all honesty, George Martin treated the ship more fairly than the show and respectfully gave them way more scenes, so to avoid messing up the whole post, i&rsquo;m going to be speaking about the show!gendrya. </i></p><p><i>i&rsquo;m going to be using some very interesting information from the blog of my good pal <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a>. They make some very thoughtful points so definitely check out their blog if you&rsquo;re up for some great Gendrya discussions. Please keep in mind that there are some things you might have already heard of; and definitely correct me if i get something wrong.</i></p><h2><b>Before meeting each other.</b></h2><p>I think it is best to start from the very beginning, and by that i mean even before Arya and Gendry first met. </p><p>A very interesting theory i&rsquo;ve been thinking about is Robert Baratheon who is obviously the father of Gendry, telling Ned that they would join their houses with marrying their children.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I have a son, you have a daughter, we&rsquo;ll join our houses&rdquo;</i></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>. The first thing you probably think of when reading this is Sansa and Joffrey who were supposed to marry each other and as Robert hoped, join the houses to bring peace. Though we all know how that ended,-Joffrey (who wasn&rsquo;t even Robert&rsquo;s son in the first place) ended up dying and Sansa&rsquo;s future took a whole different path to the point where you&rsquo;d think her desire for marriage had completely disappeared. This might be them foreshadowing the potential future of Arya and Gendry. I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;ll get married, but i am saying that this could simply represent the development of their relationship in a romantic way. It would be sort of ironic to see them getting married since Arya had been strongly against it since the very beginning of the show. that leads us to the noticeable twists game of thrones has,- Ned died in the first season when no one expected him to, Robb didn&rsquo;t even get the chance to rule Winterfell when half of the fandom was convinced he was going to be the next king, Jon fell in love with daenerys which was not only never mentioned in the books, but was also rushed and happened very quickly (unlike Gendrya who had plenty of time to develop feelings for each other, they practically closed an important chapter of their lives while they were together); that being said, you can never really predict where Arya&rsquo;s path takes us next. The show always hits us with changes and whether they&rsquo;re good or bad, they&rsquo;re often very unexpected. If you ask me, Arya&rsquo;s story is one of those that has not yet ended and there is exactly that one twist missing that is going to wrap it all up. I believe that &ldquo;twist&rdquo; has something to do with Gendry. All the other questions in her storyline are answered,- she chose to remain her identity and not become no one, she got back to her family and proved she would never betray any of them, she chose to follow her childhood dream and became her own hero. The last part is love, i believe. And Arya will need to figure it out and battle with making important decisions one more time. Their &ldquo;slow burn&rdquo; romance as i like to call it has been leading up to that all this time and i&rsquo;m hoping they will be able to fit it in and drop the bomb in the last season. </p><p>Bringing the attention to Gendry, his purpose and identity is really interesting if you think about it. Let&rsquo;s go way back and start from the main point of his role in the show. Gendry Waters is the Bastard son of Robert Baratheon, right? That&rsquo;s very clear when you observe how he acts, how he looks and even talks,-if he had been around earlier the king would instantly recognize him as his bastard kid because Gendry is a perfect definition of the name Baratheon. His appearance - dark, rough looking hair and beautiful blue eyes flawlessly portrays the house. Anyone from Cersei&rsquo;s children could not even compare to how much Gendry looked like his father. There are countless similarities which you can read more<i><b> </b></i>about<i><b> </b></i>on<b><i> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a> &rsquo;</i></b>s<b><i> </i></b>blogif you&rsquo;re interested, but i&rsquo;m going to swiftly turn back to out main topic to avoid confusion. If you take a minute to observe the plot, the show could&rsquo;ve been perfectly fine without him. That came out harsh but don&rsquo;t get me wrong, - i love him to death and he&rsquo;s one of my favorites, he has in fact done very heroic, important stuff but realistically speaking since he isn&rsquo;t technically one of the protagonists, Gendry could&rsquo;ve been easily replaced with any random &nbsp;character be it male or female, with someone like Podrick, without messing up the whole story. Instead the author strictly made him to be a bastard son of king Robert who would later meet the princess of Winterfell. See? the puzzle instantly fits. Not to mention that there were quite a few characters similar to Gendry in the show who died or were very close to dying while despite disappearing for a entire season, the boy still remained alive and received a big development from just a bastard boy who wasn&rsquo;t even aware of his identity and spent his life serving others, to Gendry, the son of King Robert Baratheon who befriended Arya&rsquo;s brother a.k.a our future king and placed a huge role in helping the queen make progress in the battle. There are characters that you&rsquo;d never expect to lose, there are characters that you know will die. but there are also a few people in GOT that have big chances of making it till the end for various different reasons, i think Gendry is one of them. May i mention how they brought him back in the last season and made him play a huge role? The writers would not make Gendry stand out if he didn&rsquo;t have a future in game of thrones, period. He is important and his story isn&rsquo;t over so killing him would be BLOODY DUMB. You started his journey and made it more significant than it could&rsquo;ve been, now it&rsquo;s your job to respect your own decisions and not act like Gendry was nothing to the show. Like mentioned above, he could&rsquo;ve been replaced with literally anyone who would be less relevant but noo. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>Gendry Baratheon</i>. As you keep watching the show and analyse his role in Arya&rsquo;s life, there are so many things about his persona that just make sense. His name makes is easier for me to connect the dots and get to the point which just screams gendrya. and That&rsquo;s one of the things that convinces me that Gendry is going to pull through this and stay in the show till the end. </p><p>A very significant scene to me is also his first meeting with Jon. Many people were upset because he didn&rsquo;t mention Arya and i&rsquo;m not gonna lie at first that left me feeling kind of bitter as well, but after investing into it more i managed to find possible explanations. I like to look at it from the bright side considering that the scene is so much more than just some boys interacting. Gendry&rsquo;s meeting with Jon was done in a way that strangely seemed too much like Ned and Robert&rsquo;s and i can bet my whole life that it was done this way on purpose. It didn&rsquo;t feel too &ldquo;formal&rdquo;, serious or tense, which is what you would normally expect since Jon is literally the legal king of the seven kingdoms. remember Ned and Robert meeting in the very first season? It went exactly like Jon and Gendry&rsquo;s; They started off with a slightly tense atmosphere until shortly after it transformed into them laughing and hugging.&nbsp;the chemistry between the characters was undoubtedly there,- they jokingly made fun of each other and instantly got along which speaks a lot about his future relationship with the Starks; name any other character Jon talked to in such a friendly, &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; way as if they had known each other since forever. If Gendry left such a great first impression on Jon, that means there&rsquo;s a clear possibility of him being in contact with not only him but the others as well. and by others yes, i mainly mean Arya. Why would he want to become good pals with Jon? Because he&rsquo;s Arya&rsquo;s brother. He wants to make up for the fact that he was part of the reason they got separated in the first place and get as close to her as possible. As for him mentioning the girl, none of us know what was going on in Gendry&rsquo;s head and that&rsquo;s why there are so many thoughts and theories about this. Probably an opinion closest to reality is that as the fandom agrees,- Gendry might&rsquo;ve thought Arya was dead. Obviously after being seperated for quite a long time plus Arya completely disappearing from Gendry&rsquo;s life, he would think she wasn&rsquo;t alive anymore. It seems logical. Even if you don&rsquo;t agree with that particular version, Gendry never really got a chance to ask about her either. Once he joined the others to help out on their mission, clearly all they were focused on was the duty, therefore i hightly doubt D&amp;D would give us the fanservise and focus on anything else than the white walkers. If you think about it, all they discuss throughout the seventh season is the plan and how to accomplish it. Rescued from serving people he didn&rsquo;t want to serve at all, Gendry gave it his all to concentrate on correcting his mistakes, which is the best excuse for this situation. He put off any of his personal issues and wishes to devote himself to saving the world legitimately, meaning he never let himself catch a break and did whatever he could to stay right beside Jon. The boy prevented himself from expressing his emotions which is comprehensible,- even if he didn&rsquo;t think Arya was dead, i reckon Gendry wouldn&rsquo;t dare to ask about her when it was his first proper interaction with Jon, she was said to be his sister after all and the last thing he would want is to make things uncomfortable and awkward between them. Both reasons are quite coherent, believe whichever you want. His commitment towards Snow perfectly showed how much he cares. Not only about the people, Jon or the world. But how much he cares about helping out someone whose sister meant so much to him.</p><p>Gendry (still) is in the process of realizing that hey, he could be suitable for his highborn lady after all and if they get the confirmation from Jon(or Daenerys) who will probably become the king, there&rsquo;s no problem in them being together. It&rsquo;s apparent that Daenerys strongly dislikes Robert, but she was the one trying to prove that the child should not be punished for their parents&rsquo; mistakes, which speaks a lot about how she might&rsquo;ve reacted. By now it&rsquo;s obvious that she isn&rsquo;t cruel nor is she stupid. If Gendry and Arya did get together, i personally see no possibilities of Daenerys denying their relationship. Even if by some chance she did, Jon would proceed to convince her to make it happen because he would be perfectly aware of the fact that it could make Arya happy. Besides may i bring this back,- Gendry left a very good impression on him which assures Jon that his sister would not be in any sorts of danger. I firmly believe he trusts him by now. What i&rsquo;m trying to get across is that in my opinion this just proves that Gendry shares his part of the story with Arya, that&rsquo;s why they are destinied to end up together. it just makes sense.</p><p>Lets move on to Arya before and after meeting Gendry. Unlike the boy, Arya did get screentime before meeting him since she&rsquo;s one of the main characters so it&rsquo;s easier to discuss what changes i spotted in her persona. In the first season, up to until the third one we see a tough little girl dreaming about becoming a warrior and being just like her father. It&rsquo;s obvious that she did not even want to imagine her and marriage and continouesly denied the idea, even making fun of Sansa for liking Joffrey. I think that&rsquo;s quite normal and does not mean that she is incapable of falling in love with someone. Arya was very young in the first season, still practically a tiny child so i think it&rsquo;s not surprising that she thought marriage was stupid. In no way am i saying that she suddenly changed her point of view when she grew up, but Arya had a very strict opinion about even considering liking someone romantically let alone spending her entire life with them and that&rsquo;s usually how most children think. Arya, around like 11 years old, would never admit anything like that. That&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m now emphasizing on the fact that her behavior and actions drastically changed later on, a very &nbsp;good example is her checking out Gendry&rsquo;s naked torso in the third season which i&rsquo;m going to discuss more later. This sums up her growth quite well, she went from the kid who was convinced she was never going to dedicate any time to love, to a girl with her first crush. As i mentioned above, her and Sansa could be on the path of switching their roles. Sansa is either going to lose interest in getting married or finally find a good partner for her(which i doubt will happen to be completely honest) and Arya falls in love with Gendry despite starting off with different expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>during the time period when her and Gendry got separated, there isn&rsquo;t many scenes with Arya mentioning him either. Believe me i was hoping for gendrya the whole time as well but just like with his situation, i was able to quickly understand the case. Arya&rsquo;s storyline throughout season 6 was very important for her to get where she is now. I believe it was essential to make her go through all that stuff to prove a point: It was not for Arya. Besides the way i personally see it is that In the gap between their reunion, there really was no time for them to be mourning over each other&rsquo;s loss. Arya tried to become someone else and forget everything from her past. It didn&rsquo;t work out. She failed to become no one for a reason, she decided to keep calling herself Arya Stark for a reason. If her story contained no love,- be it platonic or romantic whatsoever, i don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d bother to give up so easily OR come back to Winterfell. This may seem like a reach to some people, but for me it makes complete sense,- Arya came back because Joaquin&rsquo;s path didn&rsquo;t cross hers. The life she thought was perfect for her didn&rsquo;t turn out to be suitable at all and i&rsquo;m glad she was able to realize that early enough. No matter how much she changed, she belonged (still does) to Winterfell from the very beginning, there were certain people in her life that she could not let go. The writers made her change her mind and come back because there was so much more waiting for her there, because that leads us to what comes next.</p><h2><b>other ships</b></h2><p>some people seem to ship Gendry and Arya with other characters and I&rsquo;m certainly not here to fight them because of that, but for my fellow gendrya stans, i&rsquo;m going to try and explain why there&rsquo;s no chances of either of them ending up with someone else. I guess what you could call &ldquo;the most popular ships besides gendrya&rdquo; are sansa and Gendry and Arya and Joaquin. Let&rsquo;s start with strongly denying the first one.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know where to even begin because i find it challenging to comprehend what gave people reasons to ship Sansa with Gendry. On a very simple note,-they haven&rsquo;t even met. They have NOT interacted while Gendrya has had a major build up since the third season. When it is seemingly clear that both of them started gradually developing feelings for each other, i can&rsquo;t imagine Sansa proceeding to literally betray her sister and try to steal her man, lol. She grew up, became more mature and as i mentioned earlier, probably lost a big part of her interest in romance. I personally can only imagine Sansa hyping up their relationship and teasing Arya about how in love she is. Hear me out,- the writers have made tons of questionable decisions throughout the years of shooting the series, but i believe this is where they cross the border. They are perfectly aware of the fact that making Sansa and Gendry canon would stir up drama, not only because people ship gendrya, but also because it does not make sense. It would be wrong, rushed and very, very weird turn. Gendry has never expressed any interest in Sansa nor has he even metioned her.</p><p>As for Joaquin and Arya, i think i am able to get why people like the pair, though in no way do i encourage anyone to do so because it will never happen, obviously. Do i believe that Arya loved Joaquin? No. I personally see them as two individuals who had a very weird friendship connecting them. Arya never really had friends and Joaquin was one of the first people she dared to refer to as such, so of course she would be shown expressing some type of platonic feelings towards him, for instance her choosing him as her teacher or that one time she genuinely got scared, thinking he had died. Joaquin and Arya&rsquo;s friendship was one big rollercoaster which i&rsquo;m struggling to fully figure out to this day. Probably the only aspect i&rsquo;m completely sure about is that they weren&rsquo;t in love. Both of them knew they had found someone with similar goals and personality so obviously they were left on good terms and managed to even work together for some time. Joaquin taught Arya stuff that gave her a different view on certain stuff and more experience which came out quite useful in the following episodes. The two of them were never destined to be together and Joaquin&rsquo;s death was one of the things that proved that. Almost every pair in Game of thrones has a mutual connection, great chemistry and are visibly suitable for each other, however Arya and Joaquin never had that. There was not a bit romance in their scenes and they had no development in that terms whatsoever.</p><p>We already know Gendry has eyes on Arya and only.</p><p>That being said, anyone can ship what they want, but once again,-this is for gendrya shippers who think that either of the ships mentioned above have any potential of becoming canon. No they don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m pretty positive that the author and the creators of the show would never do that to us.</p><h2><b>Their scenes</b></h2><p>As mentioned in the top of this post, George Martin spoiled us and included quite a few moments of Gendrya in the books. If you&rsquo;ve read the series there&rsquo;s NO way you didn&rsquo;t interpret their relationship as a romantic one just because it&rsquo;s clearly coded that way. Like i promised i&rsquo;m not going to be going in details about why George is amazing, but it will surely take more effort to analyse the moments from the show untill i manage to get every detail of like the three scenes we got written down and examined. </p><p>Starting from the very first scene we saw them together in. I have so many thoughts about it. We all know Arya and Gendry are incredibly badass together or separated and that scene was a very good example of how well they work together. The bull and the wolf,-they&rsquo;re a perfect team and it seems as if the writers wanted to get that across immediately once they had met.</p><p>I adore the first scene. Arya gains the courage to stand up for herself despite two strangers probably scaring the shit out of her trapped at a place she knows nothing about. As she finds the energy within herself to stand up and point Needle towards hotpie&rsquo;s chin, forcing him to steadily step back, Gendry joins from behind and threatens the boy to leave Arya alone. What i love the most about the scene is Gendry&rsquo;s bitter words mixed with humor (*insert his sentence here*) and the way he defended the innocent kid. It already gives you a general idea of how lovely and courageous his personality is, leaving the best first impression for a character if you ask me. The scene is done so well in the show, he doesn&rsquo;t even think twice before scolding hotpie and shrugging it off shortly, treating Arya quite decently.&nbsp; As if he already knew he was dealing with a princess.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i>look at them.</i></p><p>Now this is a tricky thing to discuss, though one of my personal headcannons that can potentially be very true, is that show!Gendry knew Arya was a girl from that exact scene. What i mean is that he didn&rsquo;t even need to try and figure it out since he knew in the first place, while others were confused even after finding out she wasn&rsquo;t a boy. &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;do you think i&rsquo;m as stupid as the rest of them?</i>&rdquo; he says once he sees her surprised face after admitting that Arya had done a poor job lying to him; and it&rsquo;s true, he isn&rsquo;t. Gendry is incredibly smart despite not being perfect at reading and writing which by the way, was not his fault at all. Every scene with Gendry in it in the show truly does make him seem more intelligent and clever than the people he mentioned. It speaks a lot about his difference from the other boys and really makes him stand out; also adds another reason to the list of why they&rsquo;d be a perfect pair. Despite being raised as a bastard and having to go through so much rough stuff at such a young age, Gendry inherited some of the best traits of a Baratheon and grew up to be a bright man. He is quite strong and fit physically, but he is also competent and wise which if you ask me, makes him perfect for Arya. It&rsquo;s her. There&rsquo;s no way she would fall in love with someone less cool than her, so i think it&rsquo;s safe to say that Gendry is the only one right for her. </p><p>Moving onto the scene where he finds out about Arya&rsquo;s true identity, that one is definitely one of my favorites. There&rsquo;s so much that needs to be said about it because it describes so many parts of their relationship. It&rsquo;s a good portrayal of their bond, trust, chemistry.</p><p>I love how Arya didn&rsquo;t expect him to find out about her at all and tried her best to hide her shocked reaction the first time he confronted her about it. Gendry was very casual and subtle about it, just sliding the topic into their small banter as if it hadn&rsquo;t even been a huge deal and i find that endearing in a way. It expresses how mature he was at the age of 15, any other boy would most likely freak out and act as if they&rsquo;d seen a miracle.&nbsp;</p><p>Arya could&rsquo;ve easily rejected him and found more ways to lie in order to convince him otherwise, yet not only did she come clean, but also trusted him enough to admit who she really was. That was an another clear sign of &ldquo;they met and instantly found the courage within themselves to trust each other even with their deepest secrets&rdquo;. Of course the boy was very honest with her as well; &nbsp;Tell me Gendry apologizing for peeing in front of her and claiming he should&rsquo;ve been calling her &ldquo;M'lady&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t the cutest thing you saw throughout that season. What left me thinking is how he believed her immediately. Sure, Arya&rsquo;s explanation seemed pretty legit, but i doubt anyone else would let themselves to trust her that easily. He gained much more respect for Arya after finding out that the person he had been talking to wasn&rsquo;t just any other girl but the highorn lady of Winterfell. I love how Arya is already comfortable with playfully punching the guy because he had called her a lady; and the dialogue in that scene is hilarious and well done. They&rsquo;re already acting like best friends despite not even knowing each other that much and the apparent flirty tension often gets mixed within their conversations which i find very lovely. It&rsquo;s so sweet how the angry bean Arya makes Gendry full on giggle and look up at her with the most &ldquo;in love&rdquo; look in his eyes. That right there, is good acting.</p><p>I bet Gendry had a hard time hiding &nbsp;his shock when finding out that the highborn lady of Winterfell was that badass and fearless instead of a bit more girly and petite as he would&rsquo;ve expected. And i&rsquo;m strongly convinced that was the thing about Arya catching his attention and making him realize how different, stronger and better she was than any of the women he had met before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One of my absolute favorite scenes is Arya sneakily checking out her man. The scene is so incredibly iconic and remarkable that it most likely popped up in your head instantly. That&rsquo;s when any viewer immediately realizes that the writers&rsquo; intention was to show Arya&rsquo;s developing first crush.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>As Gendry trains, fully focused on his weapon, Arya literally glances up and down his body with that hungry ass look in her eyes. sorry. had to be said. It&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>We had definitely never seen the girl impressed on that level by a man in any previous (or following) seasons. Arya was just a tiny girl and as she grew up she started feeling different emotions, therefore i think it&rsquo;s quite obvious that we got to experience that with her in the said scene. Maisie&rsquo;s acting was so damn good. She managed to portray the exact same feelings Arya had perfectly which just added more reasons for people to ship the pair.</p><p>The most important scene in my opinion is of course, &ldquo;i can be your family&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m going to begin with firmly emphasizing on Maisie&rsquo;s comment about the scene.</p><p><b>Rolling stone: she obiously has family on her mind in this episode. But when she tells Gendry &ldquo;i can be your family&rdquo;, it sounds like she might mean something very different - even if she herself barely realizes it yet.</b></p><p>I really love the way this was put because they tried to avoid any major spoilers, but gave us higher chances of finding out more about how Arya feels towards Gendry. Bless them for bringing this up. It&rsquo;s clear that everyone, be it people from the fandom or outside interprets their relatioship as a romantic one.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what Maisie answers:</p><p><b>&ldquo;At first i read it as &rsquo;&lsquo;You can come to winterfell, i&rsquo;ll show you how everything goes, and you can come and sit at the table with us&rdquo;, i thought it would be a bit like Theon. But when i was doing the scene, director Alex Graves said &ldquo;when you say that last line, 'i can be your family&rsquo;, say it like 'i love you&rdquo;&rsquo;. And that&rsquo;s the take that they used.</b></p><p>To this day i&rsquo;m still struggling to believe that&rsquo;s real, but it is. Maisie practically said that Arya never saw Gendry as a brother (like Theon) but as something else. Something more. With that exact words she realized she had certain feelings towards Gendry that made it so difficult to let him go and leave. I can&rsquo;t help but mention their acting one more time because it was absolutely phenomenal. Game Of Thrones has something for every type of viewers, Fantasy, adventure and romance,-that&rsquo;s one of the reasons it&rsquo;s so popular. That being said, we&rsquo;ve had tons of different pairs with their love stories; The ones who ended up dead, the ones who survived. One aspect connecting all of them is the story of how they met and fell in love. Now this is a very bold thing to say so not many people might agree with me, but i personally think that Gendrya, the ship that hasn&rsquo;t even become canon yet, is the most romantic and epic yet, it leaves us with so much feels and want. I never felt so much love and passion towards any other ship from the show and it&rsquo;s very apparent to me why. I don&rsquo;t remember any couple from GOT that had such a slow burn, amorous and well developed plot. Gendrya does. They have so much potential. Both Maisie and Joe understand that and they give it their all to make Gendrya so obvious. In the said scene, Gendry looks like he is legitimately holding back tears as he rejects Arya&rsquo;s offer and decides to stay. He seems like as if he&rsquo;s having second thoughts and doubting his choices, there&rsquo;s so much pain depicted on his face and yet he doesn&rsquo;t have enough time to reconsider. Maisie does say the last like just like &ldquo;i love you&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s indeed much more said than just &ldquo;come to Winterfell and stay with us&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s her trying to express unconditional love and fondness. Arya is aware of her feelings towards Gendry and by the time she fully realized that, she had to leave. Just like Gendry, Arya looks just as upset and hurt. Looks like in that moment, &nbsp;it took all her willpower to turn around and go.&nbsp;</p><p>A classic Gendrya moment is her being immensely worried when the red woman took Gendry, disappearing without any explanations. I can&rsquo;t get over how mad she got and never stopped worrying about him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t talk to traitors&rdquo; CAN YOU BELIEVE HER. Arya was beyond aggrieved to the point where she even refused to talk. Her expression when Gendry gave in and they basically tied him up so he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to escape was priceless. I&rsquo;ve seen the scene about a hundred times and it gets me every. damn. time. A simple question could sum up how much she cares for him,-have you ever seen Arya so worried and hurt about something (besides Ned&rsquo;s death because DUH) throughout the season? no. She learned how to control her emotions and literally never show them, but the agony was so visible on her face in that moment. That&rsquo;s not surprising since her friend got taken away to a place she knew nothing about, but again, i&rsquo;ve never seen Arya so furious. She was worried sick and probably was ready to do anything to bring him back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Gendry&rsquo;s Jealousy</b></h2><p>Hoo boy. Don&rsquo;t even get me started. It&rsquo;s a popular headcanon in the fandom that Gendry is a jealous man when it comes to Arya, but i&rsquo;d say we could freely call it canon since it&rsquo;s painfully obvious that he&rsquo;d kill any other man if he saw them kissing his girl. lol Emphasizing on the scene where Arya was talking about Joaquin; Gendry, visibly startled, literally asks: &lsquo;you need him?&rsquo;</p><p>Now obviously he didn&rsquo;t know why Arya might&rsquo;ve needed the stranger and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons he got so uncomfortably surprised. The way Joe acts out the scene, it does seem like Gendry looks very uneasy and actually kind of pissed? rewatch the scene and tell me i&rsquo;m wrong. Even before getting together the boy wants to make sure he has no competitors and that&rsquo;s purely because he loves her so much. &nbsp;He would obviously never be controlling around Arya, but he would make sure to subtly <strike>but not really</strike> remind everyone that she was very much taken. It&rsquo;s just how he is. I imagine Arya finding his behavior very cute and just laughing about it every time she&rsquo;d notice him getting mad because of something so irrelevant. You know Gendry doesn&rsquo;t actually have any reasons to be jealous, right?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if we get more scenes of Gendry being jealous, but there sure are slight chances of that happening since he&rsquo;s most likely going to reunite Arya and have tons of screentime with her. At this point i&rsquo;ve stumbled across more than approximately 5 posts of people mentioning how Maisie and Joe were spotted filming together so i&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;re getting something. &nbsp;There are lots of expectations but who knows what might happen?</p><h2><b>forgesex2019.</b></h2><p>there has been a theory going around about Gendry and Arya&rsquo;s reunion which i personally really like. It&rsquo;s what they deserve and it&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been craving ever since we got to know them. I think it&rsquo;s a very logical explanation of the end for their relationship. @jj-justwriteit is literally the best at discussing how it could go so it would be great if you&rsquo;d read here headcanons, but i&rsquo;ll talk about it here as well. Lots of other pairs got their moments. They even managed to fit Jonerys and their sex scenes in the last scene, so i have high hopes for this. As my friend exclaimed in one of her posts, forgesex is most likely going to happen which i believe on a high level. So far it&rsquo;s a headcanon, but it will hopefully become canon in the final season. If anyone is still worried about the age difference (which is literally just five years), both of them are grown up, nearly adults. There&rsquo;s literally nothing to worry or argue about since Gendrya isn&rsquo;t the only pair with age difference. Drogo and Daenerys? She was about 14 years old when she lost her virginity but people shipped her with Khal regardless. Gendrya is just pure and completely normal, non toxic. They&rsquo;re very allowed to do whatever they want without it seeming weird. period. Arya isn&rsquo;t a child anymore.The way i personally imagine forgesex is WILD. I mean imagine a Baratheon and a Stark in love, who by the way, haven&rsquo;t seen each other for ages so the passion, love, want all of that building up in them is going to burst into flames and boom. Clothes literally ripped, on the floor, hands on each other and kisses everywhere. It would be the most epic scene any other pair has had. I imagine their reunion would be calm and just full of love at first. It&rsquo;s a clichee thing to describe but Gendry would see her first and softly mutter her name, thought loudly enough for her to hear, Arya would flinch at the familiar voice and swiftly turn around, seeing him. I already know Maisie is going to kill this. She has been great at characterizing Arya&rsquo;s intentions and actions, so when they reunite, it&rsquo;s going to be good. No matter what, it&rsquo;s going to be outstanding. I feel it.I can&rsquo;t WAIT to see Arya, Sansa and Jon meeting Gendry altogether. Imagine the flustered girl trying to hide her blush while Jon, confused attempts to find out how her sister knows Gendry. Sansa would know instantly and jokingly tease Arya later.Back to forgesex, can you imagine them getting some time fo themselves and just going at it. It would be a one big sloppy mess but at the same time for them it&rsquo;d be very special and beautiful. By now Gendry already knows that he&rsquo;s a Baratheon so he allows himself to not hold back, which will be the result of him pining her against a wall and. well, you know the rest. One thing i&rsquo;m absolutely sure about is that Arya would still have to initiate the process and strike first. Gendry notices that yes, she is in fact sure about this and wants the exact same thing, so he would start playing along. Gendry knows he has a gorgeous body, okay. Besides Joe dempsie hasn&rsquo;t been working out for NOTHING. We will get more naked Gendry and it will be for Forgesex.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>i probably missed a lot of details and forgot stuff, so if anyone reads any of this at all, a part two will be added to the whole masterpost! this was just a very quick recap slash analyzing the ship so if anyone wants me to get even more in depth and write all my feelings and predictions, simply let me know.</p><p>a huge thank you to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhP7rf7MwOMu0zWJp3U4uEg\">@jj-justwriteit</a>&nbsp; ! you inspired me to even start this masterpost.
