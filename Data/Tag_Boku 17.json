If it was the roaring sea in your ears or the laughter of children that played in the distance you loved it all. However you would be guilty if you said you just loved the scenery. In fact there\u2019s was another reason why you went to the beach so often but you would never tell anyone. </p><p>It was for your favorite raging lifeguard. </p><p>You always had a <strike>large</strike> small soft spot for him and seeing him in just his red swim trunks and shirtless body you couldn\u2019t help yourself but stare at him. Of course the raging lifeguard caught wind of your staring weeks ago; right when summer break started actually and he simply return your stupid flirty gazes with showing off his abs in the sun and simply throwing his arms over his head to \u201cstretch\u201d but flex his muscles. </p><p>He loved watching you drool and peek up from your sunglasses knowing that all your attention was in him. What could he say? You boosted his ego and he loved the attention. </p><p>However as the days go on and you coming to visit him on weekends like a regular he noticed some other regulars that started to show up. Other regulars like&hellip;..them. </p><p>Those hotshot surfers at the beach. They always seemed to attract a crowed and Bakugo could care less about them but he noticed one of them trying to steal your gaze away from him. </p><p>Now that pissed him off. Like hell he\u2019ll let some water brain idiot sweep you off your feet infront of him. He already set his eyes on you and he was damned ready to fight over you if he had to. However, no matter how much he wanted to walk over and just claim you there something in the back of him mind was holding him back. </p><p>The man was a prideful asshole and he knew that but it wasn\u2019t pride that was keeping him back&hellip;.it was fear of rejection. Bakugo was scared of approaching you even thought he never talked to you. He didn\u2019t know if you liked his firey attitude or his blunt comments. Perhaps you were just looking at him for his looks. </p><p>\u201cYo Bakugo time to roatate!!!\u201d A familiar voice called him and Bakugo looked over through his sunglasses and let out a huff. </p><p>His next rotation, the one closest to you. Infact you made yourself comfortable to sit right next to his post. Now if that didn\u2019t sent a shiver through his spin then he might aswell said today was a cold day. </p><p>Of course Kirishima knew what was going on. Bakugo always packed up slowly so he looked like he dreaded going over (which was a lie). In fact Kirishima knew from the start about his crush on you and he\u2019s been trying to encourage him to finally ask you out. And buy encourage his ment by talking about his girlfriend all the time and telling the raging blonde how he needed to find his special someone. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck shit up shitty hair.\u201d Bakugo said and Kirishima smiled with a toothy grin</p><p>\u201cAs to you Bakugo~\u201d Kirishima smirked and patted Bakugo\u2019s shoulder and sended him off. </p><p>Walking over to you Bakugo saw you move your legs and he stopped staring at your beautiful skin in the sun. What he wouldn\u2019t give to have those to kiss and love\u2014he shook his head. Damn him he really needed to get laid or something and having you here wasn\u2019t helping his situation. When was the last time he was with another girl? </p><p>Making his way over across the many beach towels and umbrellas he caught a glance at your eyes again. You smiled at him and waved and Bakugo felt his face blush in full bloom making him miss his step and trip into a hole made by some teens. </p><p>The blonde hair groaned as he saw the teen looked down and Bakugo opened his eyes showing his rage. Quickly sitting up he climbed out of the hole and glared down the kids.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s fuckin funny watching people trip in your traps you brats?!?\u201d He asked and he saw the teen flinch </p><p>If anyone knew about this beach long enough it was don\u2019t piss off the Lifeguards. Especially Bakugo the famous blonde for having a temper with rowdy teens. </p><p>\u201cWell do ya!?!?!\u201d Bakugo yelled and the teens looked down and they started stammering ouy excuses, all to which the blonde didn\u2019t care. Bakugo sighed with a tsk and Pointed to all of them. </p><p>\u201cClean this fucking mess right now before I shove you all into the sand, go it!?!\u201d He yelled and the teens nodded their head quickly making their way to fix up their mess. </p><p>Bakugo sighed and finally made his way to his post setting down his lifeguard tube and taking another drink of his water before climbing up to sit in his chair. </p><p>He heard you snicker from his left and he glanced down at you and he saw you watching the teens still clean in their mess.

Of course the raging lifeguard caught wind of your staring weeks ago; right when summer break started actually and he simply return your stupid flirty gazes with showing off his abs in the sun and simply throwing his arms over his head to \u201cstretch\u201d but flex his muscles. </p><p>He loved watching you drool and peek up from your sunglasses knowing that all your attention was in him. What could he say?

Though he has seen mountains before, these are even more amazing. Bigger, higher, even more dangerous. He looks up to them. Sometimes he wishes he were a mountain. Nobody could move them. Everyone was impressed by them. Everyone respected them. And anyone who dared to not respect a mountain died. Katsuki likes the thought.<br/>The sun is already setting and just the peeks of the mountains, covered in snow are still glittering in golden sunlight. Everything else slowly fades into blue. Deep blue shadows of mountains that swallow everything. Katsuki likes the thought.</p><p>\u201cWould someone miss you?\u201d<br/>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d</p><p>Shouto had been listening to Katsuki\u2019s crunches for two hours now. He won\u2019t dare to look outside. He doesn\u2019t want to see this. He doesn\u2019t need to. He will have forgotten in a few hours anyway. It had become too dark to read in the car an hour ago. Now he just stares at his hands and waits.<br/>Either to wake up in a few moments, realize he had been dreaming and start an average day of life with a pretty average breakfast and some average, meaningless conversation with lame people.<br/>Or until they reach their destination, get out the taxi and get this all over with.<br/>So he waits.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we fail?\u201d<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing. No pity-attempts.\u201d</p><p>They set up their tent ten meters away from the edge. It\u2019s dark and they hardly see anything at all. It\u2019s cold and Shouto wears a tank top. As they slip inside the tent and under their covers he still shivers. Katsuki shuffles closer to him and slips under his blanket too. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring warmer clothes?\u201d \u2013 \u201cI thought it wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d Katsuki tries to come closer and hugs him.

When he steps outside, he\u2019s sitting on the ground staring at his book. \u201cHi\u201d, Katsuki says and it sounds scratchy and forced. \u201cHi.\u201d Shouto puts down his book and looks at him as he pulls a water bottle from the tent and drinks. The stare makes him uncomfortable after a few seconds so he holds the bottle in Shouto\u2019s direction. \u201cWater?\u201d Shouto finishes the bottle.<br>Katsuki sits down beside him. \u201cDid you look down?\u201d \u2013 \u201cNo.\u201d \u2013 \u201cCoward.\u201d Silence.<br>\u201cWould you look down with me?\u201d<br>\u201cHuh?\u201d Katsuki turns his head. Shouto looks back.<br>\u201c\u2026Okay\u201d, he says slowly. After little hesitation, he takes Shouto\u2019s hand. They get up and walk towards the edge.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I pushed you down?\u201d, Katsuki asks. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d They take the last step, look at each other, look down.<br>It\u2019s water.<br>\u201cHow high is this?\u201d, Shouto asks. \u201cI dunno, like 50 meters?\u201d, Katsuki throws a pebble down. \u201cHave you been here?\u201d \u2013 \u201cNah, just in a village nearby. Never actually seen the cliff.\u201d They look down for a few minutes. \u201cWhat happens when you fall? Like, when you know you\u2019re gonna be dead? Does your life flash before you? Or does\u2026\u201d \u2013 \u201cHow should I know?\u201d Shouto takes off his shoes. \u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201d Katsuki\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWait, wait\u2026 <i>now</i>?\u201d They look at each other. \u201cYeah, <i>now</i>.\u201d Throwing his shoes towards the tent, Shouto closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. \u201cWait, wait!\u201d Katsuki grabs his wrist. \u201cWe should\u2026\u201d, he throws his head around searching for <i>something</i>.</p><p>Shouto opens his eyes and turns around. Katsuki looks at him, his hand still holding tightly onto his wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sometimes wish I\u2019d never been born at all.\u201d<br>\u201cLove me.\u201d</p></p>",

Though he has seen mountains before, these are even more amazing. Bigger, higher, even more dangerous. He looks up to them. Sometimes he wishes he were a mountain. Nobody could move them. Everyone was impressed by them. Everyone respected them. And anyone who dared to not respect a mountain died. Katsuki likes the thought.<br />The sun is already setting and just the peeks of the mountains, covered in snow are still glittering in golden sunlight. Everything else slowly fades into blue. Deep blue shadows of mountains that swallow everything. Katsuki likes the thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Would someone miss you?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto had been listening to Katsuki&rsquo;s crunches for two hours now. He won&rsquo;t dare to look outside. He doesn&rsquo;t want to see this. He doesn&rsquo;t need to. He will have forgotten in a few hours anyway. It had become too dark to read in the car an hour ago. Now he just stares at his hands and waits.<br />Either to wake up in a few moments, realize he had been dreaming and start an average day of life with a pretty average breakfast and some average, meaningless conversation with lame people.<br />Or until they reach their destination, get out the taxi and get this all over with.<br />So he waits.</p><p>&ldquo;What if we fail?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all or nothing. No pity-attempts.&rdquo;</p><p>They set up their tent ten meters away from the edge. It&rsquo;s dark and they hardly see anything at all. It&rsquo;s cold and Shouto wears a tank top. As they slip inside the tent and under their covers he still shivers. Katsuki shuffles closer to him and slips under his blanket too. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring warmer clothes?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Katsuki tries to come closer and hugs him. Shouto doesn&rsquo;t say anything. He just hugs back. The warmth is nice. He wonders what it feels like to hug a dead person. Katsuki puts his hands on Shouto&rsquo;s back and starts rubbing it slowly. With time, he gets more confident and rubs Shoutos neck and his hips and his torso. Shouto doesn&rsquo;t say anything. &ldquo;What if I fucked you right now?&rdquo; Katsuki asked. Shrug. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t care?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forget it anyway.&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll forget I fucked you?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I will forget everything.&rdquo; Silence.<br />&ldquo;So&hellip; If we were naked right now&hellip;&rdquo; He tries to create a mental image of naked Shouto. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d be running my fingers down the inside of your thighs&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell you to stop fooling around and just do it.&rdquo; Katsuki hesitates. &ldquo;And I think I&rsquo;d be pretty nervous.&rdquo; Shouto shifts a little to look him in the eyes. They can barely make out each other&rsquo;s faces. &ldquo;You? You would be nervous?&rdquo; He nods. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be. I&rsquo;d think it&rsquo;d be over in a few minutes and we won&rsquo;t even know it happened at all within the next few hours. There&rsquo;s no evidence of anything. I could let go. I wouldn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; With that, Shouto turns around. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot. You&rsquo;re gonna die because nothing matters. And nothing matters because you&rsquo;re gonna die.&rdquo; Shuffling closer to Shouto&rsquo;s back, Katsuki slams his fist against his back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so unromantic. There is just nothing that matters to you.&rdquo;<br />Silence.<br />&ldquo;That is the point. That is why I am here. Why I texted you in the first place. Nothing matters. Nothing ever will. We&rsquo;re all going to die, so we might as well get it over with now.&rdquo; Katsuki breathes heavily. &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; He gets up and grabs Shouto&rsquo;s shoulders shaking him. &ldquo;I want to live before I die. How else do I know I&rsquo;m dead!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you hold my hand?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto wakes up when Katsuki starts snoring beside him. The tent is bathed in blue light and as Shouto sticks his head out. The sun is slowly rising behind the tip of the far mountains. His stomach makes weird sound and his mouth feels dry. He thinks about going to the edge and looking down. He doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s down there. Maybe it&rsquo;s stone and he&rsquo;ll crash down and his body will explode like a disgusting grenade and leave blood everywhere. Or it&rsquo;s trees and a branch will catch his body and part him in two pieces. Or it&rsquo;s water and he&rsquo;ll just sink down to the ground in an awkward misshaped form. Shouto doesn&rsquo;t really know what he&rsquo;d prefer. He takes on a shirt and slips out of the tent. </p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Jump with me.&rdquo;</p><p>When Katsuki wakes up, it&rsquo;s because the sun heats up the tent and he almost chokes.
