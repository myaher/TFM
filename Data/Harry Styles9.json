She goes to tap on his tent with her free hand, when he gruffly replies that he\u2019s awake. \u201cHi sorry Calum, I didn\u2019t really know where else to go. Is it okay if I stay the night here? My original plan was to sleep on the bench out by the path but thumper here wouldn\u2019t sit still enough and he peed on my shirt.\u201d She says as she lets thumper down and walks over to where Calum\u2019s sat. She smells the alcohol on his lips as she gets closer and Calum is looking at her with hooded eyes. \u201cCourse puppy, you can sleep with me, have the king size bed all to myself anyways so there\u2019s more than enough room\u201d he says with a sly smile and a pat to the bed. Y/N walks over and sits down on the spot he patted. \u201cCould I also borrow a shirt? I don\u2019t want to smell like bunny pee please\u201d she giggles quietly. \u201cCourse sweet girl here.\u201d He replies as he lifts the shirt he\u2019s currently wearing and gives it to her and turns his body away so she can change in privacy. \u201cYou want a drink puppy? I only have beer here at the moment\u201d </p><p> He turns back in time to see her nod her head and put her hair to the side. \u201cI think Harry and Kara mated?\u201d She says as she accepts the bottle. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works pet, they\u2019ll mate only when she\u2019s in heat then he\u2019ll be able to mate her, and since i haven\u2019t smelt a change coming from her I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re just fucking. Is that why you\u2019re out so late in your pjs?\u201d He asks, she nods. </p><p><br/></p><p>After about 3 bottles Y/Ns feeling lightheaded, she\u2019s not drunk but she feels comfortable enough to fall back asleep without the sounds she heard from Harry playing in her head. </p><p>\u201cHere puppy under the blankets, it gets colder in a tent obviously but I have my little canvas stove running.\u201d Calum says as he tucks her in closer to him in the middle. He stands up and puts her shirt beside her side of the bed so thumper has something to lay on then sets up the pet pen he brought for her earlier but forgot to give it to her, he then sets thumper down in it. </p><p>After they\u2019re tucked in under the blankets both still wide awake, they begin talking about their plans for the coming week. Calum tells her how he\u2019ll need help bringing in bags of flour but none of the other alphas will be around since they\u2019re still working on ways to keep the pups warm. He\u2019s told her how last winter was so harsh they lost 3 pups due to the cold. So they want to take every measure so it doesn\u2019t happen this winter. \u201cHow come I can\u2019t come help you?\u201d She asks after thinking on it for a while. \u201cYou\u2019re still unmarked, you might attract rogue alphas, can\u2019t risk them coming close to the village or close to the city. It\u2019s about a 20 minute run in wolf form but carrying the flour back will need to be in human form which takes 2 hours. there\u2019s no other way and we\u2019ll both be at our most vulnerable so I can\u2019t protect you.\u201d Y/N stews on it a while longer and chews on her lip and turns to face him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you mark me?\u201d She asks shyly as she pets his chest. </p><p>Calum looks at her and put his hand on her cheek and rubs it with his thumb. \u201cSweet little puppy, you\u2019re ready to be marked?\u201d He asks her with his beer breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a little sting as I bite into you, are you sure your up for it?\u201d He goes to lift himself and hover over her as he waits for her reply. Y/N submits to him and moves to lay on her back under him and nods her head as she looks up at him. \u201cYes, please, Want more freedom Calum. Know you can give me that.\u201d She says as she rubs on his chest lowering her hand to his abs. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do this than\u201d he says as he lifts and pulls her head towards his and kisses her in a forceful manner. Y/N liking where this is heading, starts bucking her hips up towards his and he continues with kissing her then pushes between her legs till they\u2019re bent on either side of his hips and he ends the kiss and starts kissing down her cheek towards her neck. \u201cSmell so sweet puppy, all fresh for the taking huh?\u201d He asks as he licks into her neck. His hand goes under the shirt she\u2019s wearing and tugs on it till it\u2019s just over her breasts. \u201cSuch pretty tits too huh, cute nipples begging to be sucked on and bitten\u201d Calum says as he goes to take one of her nipples into his mouth. Y/N\u2019s body starts to writhe under him and her hand goes to lower the boxers he\u2019s wearing when he stops her. \u201c no puppy you don\u2019t get to touch me unless I tell you, omegas are good and still as the alpha takes what he needs. Promise I\u2019ll make you feel good as I do it.\u201d He says as he continues with lightly tugging her other nipple with his teeth. </p><p>Calum lifts the shirt off of her completely and sits up between her legs and helps her wiggle her shorts and panties off. \u201cGonna lick into you pet, been waiting patiently to since I first smelled you.\u201d He says as he lays down and throws her thighs on either side of his head. Calum starts licking and sucking into her core as Y/Ns whimpering and panting. She\u2019s holding onto the sheets with her fists as she begins bucking into his mouth. </p><p>Calum uses one finger and slides it inside her pussy as his thumb on his other hand begins rubbing little circles over her other tight hole. \u201cGonna have my way with your pretty bum puppy. Im guessing you haven\u2019t done that before?\u201d He asks her as she moans loudly, she nods her head and quickly adds she hasn\u2019t even had sex before as a human and Calum growls. The alpha side of him thats competitive adds another finger into her pussy scissoring her open the wetness leaking from her pussy acts as lube. \u201cGonna fucking ruin you puppy, fuck! I\u2019m gonna keep you for myself and fill you with my scent so no other alpha comes near you!\u201d He says and he goes to sit up he leans down and starts licking into her mouth,Y/N moans around his tongue as she tastes herself. Her body is on fire as she feels Calum settle on top of her. \u201cOkay pet going to slip inside and fill you while I mark you.\u201d He says in a heavy breath in her face. Y/N nods as her body tightens, she doesn\u2019t know what to expect. </p><p>\u201cSorry it\u2019s going to be a slow burn puppy\u201d he says as he pulls his leaking cock from his boxers, and starts painting up and down in slow strokes over her clit. He goes to kiss her to quiet her cries as he slowly starts pushing into her. Y/N\u2019s hands go to scratch his back as her eyes start to tear up, and she cries into his mouth. she can feel the burn he warned her about but it\u2019s also pleasurable as her sensitive nipples rub against his chest. \u201cSorry sweets, it\u2019ll start to feel good I swear it\u201d he says as he starts pumping into her tight core. Y/N lays there as Calum fucks into her, she waits for it to feel good like he says but it just hurts the entire time. Calum leans his head down and starts little kisses on her collarbone and sucking little hickeys into it when she feels his sharp teeth start to line up on her skin. \u201cWait Calum!\u201d She says in a panic voice when he bites down hard on her neck. Y/N screams as he licks the area and goes to line up and bites into the top part of her breast. Y/N is full on crying now as Calum pulls out, flips her onto her tummy and lifts her hips towards him as he lines up and pushes into her again. Y/N puts her face into the pillow as Calum starts to fuck her into the mattress with his heavy body. He lines up and bites her on her shoulder, then licks it like before, telling her it\u2019s to close the marking. \u201cGuess it hurts this time, haven\u2019t had a virgin before but I promise puppy it will feel good the next time\u201d he grunts.</p><p>After a full hour of Calum basically using her to get himself off, he pulls out and finishes on her back. Y/N curls into a ball on her side as her body still feels sore. \u201cSorry puppy. We\u2019ll wait a long while before I fuck into your tight bum.\u201d He says as he tucks himself into his boxers, he stands up and goes to grab a dirty towel and wipes away at the mess he made on her. \u201cSorry sweets.\u201d He says as he lays down and pulls her to him. </p><p>Y/N curls into him and wipes her watery eyes with her hands.</p><p><br/></p><p>Harry awakes the next morning late in the day, Kara is nowhere to be found and he notices the bedroom door is left open. He stands up and cleans the living room of any mess him and Kara made then walks over to the bedroom and knocks against the open door. No one answers so he heads to the bathroom, knocks on that door and no one answers. Harry then remembers making eye contact with Y/N who was stood by the front door and remembers seeing her leave. He could\u2019ve sworn that he imagined that last night considering he was balls deep in an omega so he can\u2019t rely on his memory for anything else. </p><p>Y/N wakes up next to Calum snoring quite loudly. Her body is covered in bruises from where Calum grabbed at her and dark purple marks where be bite her but it\u2019s not sore like she was expecting. </p><p>She goes to cover herself with the blanket and try to fall back asleep when she hears a muted tap come from the outside of the tent. \u201cHey Calum, you up? Have you seen Y/N?\u201d Harry shouts. Y/N panics and looks around the bed for her clothes when she hears his zipper open up and Harry pops his head in. She looks at him like a deer caught in the headlights, and he does the same. \u201cH-Hi Harry&hellip;\u201d she says in a choked whisper. \u201cWhat are you doing here and where are your clothes!?\u201d He shouts as he enters the tent, waking Calum in the process. \u201cSup pal, what you doing here so early?\u201d Calum says with his one eye opened then closes it and covers his eyes with his arm. \u201cWhat the fuck? I told you to stay away from him and here you reeking of his scent!\u201d Harry says as he stomps toward her. He grabs her arm and pulls her out of the bed, still naked when he looks at the bruises lining her body. Y/Ns stood there shaking from the cold and Harry\u2019s harsh stare. \u201cyou fucking marked her?\u201d He says in disbelief. \u201cShe begged me to, she wants more freedom H she\u2019s coming with me to the city to grab more food supplies later this week.\u201d Calum says still not bothered. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to risk a rogue following us cause of her scent!\u201d He finishes. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold Harry could I get dressed please?\u201d Y/N asks but refuses to look at him.  </p><p>Harry looks disgusted at Calum then looks pitifully at Y/N. \u201ccourse you can puppy, here\u201d he says as he reaches down and takes the shirt off his body when he realizes thumper has peed on her pj shirt that\u2019s under him. He looks for her pj shorts and undies and helps her into them gently, careful not to touch any of her bruises. \u201cCome on puppy let\u2019s go home\u201d he says as he reaches for thumper who comes to his hand willingly. \u201cYou can clean the bunny shit up Calum, it\u2019s the least you can do after using her\u201d He says after Y/N leaves the tent. Calum huffs then rolls over to his stomach and easily falls back asleep. </p><p><br/></p><p>Back at Harry\u2019s cabin he runs Y/N a bath, he grabs her clean clothes and towels and sets them down next to her. Y/N sits there on the bathroom counter where he set her and watches as he lines the tub with Epsom salts and her favourite body wash. \u201cCan I use the Epsom salts or will they burn me?\u201d She asks him as he stands. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean burn you? You\u2019ve used them before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, i imagine I\u2019ll have tears since this was my first time\u201d she shrugs. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any tears, remember I was there when you presented, your body pushed itself apart to fit an alphas.\u201d He says as he turns off the water and helps Y/N down from the counter. </p><p>\u201cNo I mean it was my first time, first time. Like I\u2019ve never had sex before&hellip;\u201d she ends her sentence quieter than she began like she\u2019s embarrassed. \u201cAnd Calum was pretty&hellip;. rough&hellip;\u201d she looks down at her feet and twiddles her toes. \u201cYou were a virgin?\u201d He asks after standing there for a while. \u201cYou&hellip; that- Look pet, your first time definitely shouldn\u2019t have been with Calum. He\u2019s a good guy sure but he follows his animal biology when it comes to sex. I\u2019m sorry puppy you shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to that.\u201d Harry says as he lifts her head to look at him, \u201clet\u2019s forgo the Salts for now than hmm?\u201d He says and kisses her forehead. He closes the bathroom door and Y/N undresses and steps into the tub slowly soaking her tired body. </p><p><br/></p><p>Later in the evening when Y/N\u2019s back in Harry\u2019s bed she awakes to a loud shouting coming from the daycare. Her omega instincts are quick to worry for the pups as she gets up and runs down the hill to the daycare. Where she sees Kara, Lucy, Niall, Jack, Calum, and Harry. Kara currently being held down to the ground on her stomach by Jack and Niall. Y/N runs passed them towards the pups in the daycare and is met by Catalina and another mated omega from the village. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on are the pups okay?\u201d She asks out of breath, still in a tank top and pj shorts. Catalina was quick to reassure her that they were okay and says \u201cKara\u2019s a rogue. Lucy\u2019s going to have her beheaded at dawn.\u201d Y/N looks at her then the other omega who nods her head telling her she heard right. \u201cWell what does that mean she\u2019s a rogue?\u201d \u201cRogues live to tear down villages. They go for the pups first. Once the pups are killed it depresses the pack into submission. Once they have a way in, then more will come till they kill us and overtake our village and resources.\u201d Catalina explains the shops Y/N into the den under the daycare where the pups are crying and her body tells her to comfort them. </p><p><br/></p><p>After the pups are asleep Y/N comes out to Kara being put in a sterling silver cone around her head and her hands in matching handcuffs. \u201cTo keep her from shifting\u201d Niall explains. Y/N nods as she looks at everyone forming around Kara. \u201cSo who does the beheading?\u201d She asks him quietly, \u201cHarry will have to, he\u2019s the one that hid her scent with his and brought her in passed the vines\u201d He says and quickly adds \u201cHe will also go through some form of punishment that Lucy will go over with the village and once everyone agrees there\u2019s a good chance he might be kicked out of the village as well.\u201d Niall finishes as he walks away. Y/Ns stood there bewildered. Harry might be kicked out? </p><p>The next day. </p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s in agreement, 30 lashings for bringing and harbouring a rogue in the village.\u201d Lucy shouts over everyone at the town hall. Y/N is stood beside Catalina and Liam near the back of the pack. \u201cAs for banishment, it\u2019s in  agreement that for now, Harry stays. But, will be shunned for 30 days and 30 nights in the Well. Anyone seen talking to Harry will face being shunned too!\u201d Y/N stood there staring at Harry who was on the stage next to Lucy and Kara. his head hung low and face hidden behind his long hair. </p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019ll stay in the village?\u201d She asks as everyone disperses the town hall. Catalina nods and reply\u2019s \u201cpoor guy I understand the severity of a rogue entering, but I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s facing such a harsh punishment from Lucy. How was he to know the omega village was hiding a rogue!\u201d \u201cCome Catalina, it\u2019s getting late you\u2019re going home.\u201d Liam tells her and she listens right away. \u201cY/N! Come puppy you should be getting back too!\u201d Calum says as he goes to reach for her hand but she jerks it away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d She says to him with a glare. \u201cHarry said to stay away from you but you sure fooled me into thinking you\u2019d care for me in such a intimate way.\u201d She goes to walk away from him but he grabs at her arm \u201cyou listen to me when I\u2019m telling you something\u201d he says forcefully and she bows her head. \u201cHarry will be in the Well the next little while, I\u2019ll be taking care of you since I marked you. Now, go home and if you ever speak back to me in such a tone I\u2019ll have to punish you, you understand?\u201d </p><p>Y/N nods and let\u2019s Calum lead her back towards Harry\u2019s cabin. </p><p><br/></p><p>The next dawn they march Kara and Harry to the hill where they behead rogues and unruly village members.  Harry was dressed in black as was Kara. Lucy waved her hand to silence everyone and nods her head towards Harry who goes to swing the large silver axe that cuts off Kara\u2019s head. Then Lucy hands him the torch that lights Kara\u2019s body in flames. </p><p>Next Lucy ties Harry to a pole with sterling silver cuffs holding him to it tightly and hands the silver whip to Alex who delivers 30 lashes to Harry\u2019s back that slices through his black shirt into his skin. Harry whimpers a few times but quickly stands tall when it\u2019s over. He makes eye contact with Y/N who looks at him sadly with tears in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s more a way of humiliating him than it is meant to actually harm him, as werewolves heal pretty quick. the silver will burn him sure, but the 30 days and nights in the Well will be painful. He\u2019s basically starving to death\u201d Niall explains to Y/N. </p><p>\u201cSo I cant help him at all the next little while?\u201d She asks Niall sadly. He nods then says \u201cabout our date, Listen pet since Calum marked you I\u2019m sure you understand that I\u2019m not going to be pursuing you while you wear his scent and mark. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d \u201cWait, how long do markings last for?\u201d \u201cRoughly a few months, unless you hit your heat. Then you can be freshly marked by another alpha.\u201d Y/N nods. </p><p>Guess she has to obey Calum now.  </p><p>\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40 </p>",

My original plan was to sleep on the bench out by the path but thumper here wouldn\u2019t sit still enough and he peed on my shirt.\u201d She says as she lets thumper down and walks over to where Calum\u2019s sat.

He lines up and bites her on her shoulder, then licks it like before, telling her it\u2019s to close the marking. \u201cGuess it hurts this time, haven\u2019t had a virgin before but I promise puppy it will feel good the next time\u201d he grunts.</p><p>After a full hour of Calum basically using her to get himself off, he pulls out and finishes on her back. Y/N curls into a ball on her side as her body still feels sore. \u201cSorry puppy. We\u2019ll wait a long while before I fuck into your tight bum.\u201d He says as he tucks himself into his boxers, he stands up and goes to grab a dirty towel and wipes away at the mess he made on her. \u201cSorry sweets.\u201d He says as he lays down and pulls her to him. </p><p>Y/N curls into him and wipes her watery eyes with her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Harry awakes the next morning late in the day, Kara is nowhere to be found and he notices the bedroom door is left open. He stands up and cleans the living room of any mess him and Kara made then walks over to the bedroom and knocks against the open door. No one answers so he heads to the bathroom, knocks on that door and no one answers. Harry then remembers making eye contact with Y/N who was stood by the front door and remembers seeing her leave. He could\u2019ve sworn that he imagined that last night considering he was balls deep in an omega so he can\u2019t rely on his memory for anything else. </p><p>Y/N wakes up next to Calum snoring quite loudly. Her body is covered in bruises from where Calum grabbed at her and dark purple marks where be bite her but it\u2019s not sore like she was expecting. </p><p>She goes to cover herself with the blanket and try to fall back asleep when she hears a muted tap come from the outside of the tent. \u201cHey Calum, you up? Have you seen Y/N?\u201d Harry shouts. Y/N panics and looks around the bed for her clothes when she hears his zipper open up and Harry pops his head in. She looks at him like a deer caught in the headlights, and he does the same. \u201cH-Hi Harry\u2026\u201d she says in a choked whisper. \u201cWhat are you doing here and where are your clothes!?\u201d He shouts as he enters the tent, waking Calum in the process. \u201cSup pal, what you doing here so early?\u201d Calum says with his one eye opened then closes it and covers his eyes with his arm. \u201cWhat the fuck? I told you to stay away from him and here you reeking of his scent!\u201d Harry says as he stomps toward her. He grabs her arm and pulls her out of the bed, still naked when he looks at the bruises lining her body. Y/Ns stood there shaking from the cold and Harry\u2019s harsh stare. \u201cyou fucking marked her?\u201d He says in disbelief. \u201cShe begged me to, she wants more freedom H she\u2019s coming with me to the city to grab more food supplies later this week.\u201d Calum says still not bothered. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to risk a rogue following us cause of her scent!\u201d He finishes. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold Harry could I get dressed please?\u201d Y/N asks but refuses to look at him.  </p><p>Harry looks disgusted at Calum then looks pitifully at Y/N. \u201ccourse you can puppy, here\u201d he says as he reaches down and takes the shirt off his body when he realizes thumper has peed on her pj shirt that\u2019s under him. He looks for her pj shorts and undies and helps her into them gently, careful not to touch any of her bruises. \u201cCome on puppy let\u2019s go home\u201d he says as he reaches for thumper who comes to his hand willingly. \u201cYou can clean the bunny shit up Calum, it\u2019s the least you can do after using her\u201d He says after Y/N leaves the tent. Calum huffs then rolls over to his stomach and easily falls back asleep. </p><p><br></p><p>Back at Harry\u2019s cabin he runs Y/N a bath, he grabs her clean clothes and towels and sets them down next to her. Y/N sits there on the bathroom counter where he set her and watches as he lines the tub with Epsom salts and her favourite body wash. \u201cCan I use the Epsom salts or will they burn me?\u201d She asks him as he stands. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean burn you? You\u2019ve used them before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, i imagine I\u2019ll have tears since this was my first time\u201d she shrugs. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any tears, remember I was there when you presented, your body pushed itself apart to fit an alphas.\u201d He says as he turns off the water and helps Y/N down from the counter. </p><p>\u201cNo I mean it was my first time, first time. Like I\u2019ve never had sex before\u2026\u201d she ends her sentence quieter than she began like she\u2019s embarrassed. \u201cAnd Calum was pretty\u2026. rough\u2026\u201d she looks down at her feet and twiddles her toes. \u201cYou were a virgin?\u201d He asks after standing there for a while. \u201cYou\u2026 that- Look pet, your first time definitely shouldn\u2019t have been with Calum. He\u2019s a good guy sure but he follows his animal biology when it comes to sex. I\u2019m sorry puppy you shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to that.\u201d Harry says as he lifts her head to look at him, \u201clet\u2019s forgo the Salts for now than hmm?\u201d He says and kisses her forehead. He closes the bathroom door and Y/N undresses and steps into the tub slowly soaking her tired body. </p><p><br></p><p>Later in the evening when Y/N\u2019s back in Harry\u2019s bed she awakes to a loud shouting coming from the daycare. Her omega instincts are quick to worry for the pups as she gets up and runs down the hill to the daycare. Where she sees Kara, Lucy, Niall, Jack, Calum, and Harry. Kara currently being held down to the ground on her stomach by Jack and Niall. Y/N runs passed them towards the pups in the daycare and is met by Catalina and another mated omega from the village. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on are the pups okay?\u201d She asks out of breath, still in a tank top and pj shorts. Catalina was quick to reassure her that they were okay and says \u201cKara\u2019s a rogue. Lucy\u2019s going to have her beheaded at dawn.\u201d Y/N looks at her then the other omega who nods her head telling her she heard right. \u201cWell what does that mean she\u2019s a rogue?\u201d \u201cRogues live to tear down villages. They go for the pups first. Once the pups are killed it depresses the pack into submission. Once they have a way in, then more will come till they kill us and overtake our village and resources.\u201d Catalina explains the shops Y/N into the den under the daycare where the pups are crying and her body tells her to comfort them. </p><p><br></p><p>After the pups are asleep Y/N comes out to Kara being put in a sterling silver cone around her head and her hands in matching handcuffs. \u201cTo keep her from shifting\u201d Niall explains. Y/N nods as she looks at everyone forming around Kara. \u201cSo who does the beheading?\u201d She asks him quietly, \u201cHarry will have to, he\u2019s the one that hid her scent with his and brought her in passed the vines\u201d He says and quickly adds \u201cHe will also go through some form of punishment that Lucy will go over with the village and once everyone agrees there\u2019s a good chance he might be kicked out of the village as well.\u201d Niall finishes as he walks away. Y/Ns stood there bewildered. Harry might be kicked out? </p><p>The next day. </p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s in agreement, 30 lashings for bringing and harbouring a rogue in the village.\u201d Lucy shouts over everyone at the town hall. Y/N is stood beside Catalina and Liam near the back of the pack. \u201cAs for banishment, it\u2019s in  agreement that for now, Harry stays. But, will be shunned for 30 days and 30 nights in the Well. Anyone seen talking to Harry will face being shunned too!\u201d Y/N stood there staring at Harry who was on the stage next to Lucy and Kara. his head hung low and face hidden behind his long hair. </p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019ll stay in the village?\u201d She asks as everyone disperses the town hall. Catalina nods and reply\u2019s \u201cpoor guy I understand the severity of a rogue entering, but I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s facing such a harsh punishment from Lucy. How was he to know the omega village was hiding a rogue!\u201d \u201cCome Catalina, it\u2019s getting late you\u2019re going home.\u201d Liam tells her and she listens right away. \u201cY/N! Come puppy you should be getting back too!\u201d Calum says as he goes to reach for her hand but she jerks it away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d She says to him with a glare. \u201cHarry said to stay away from you but you sure fooled me into thinking you\u2019d care for me in such a intimate way.\u201d She goes to walk away from him but he grabs at her arm \u201cyou listen to me when I\u2019m telling you something\u201d he says forcefully and she bows her head. \u201cHarry will be in the Well the next little while, I\u2019ll be taking care of you since I marked you. Now, go home and if you ever speak back to me in such a tone I\u2019ll have to punish you, you understand?\u201d </p><p>Y/N nods and let\u2019s Calum lead her back towards Harry\u2019s cabin. </p><p><br></p><p>The next dawn they march Kara and Harry to the hill where they behead rogues and unruly village members.  Harry was dressed in black as was Kara. Lucy waved her hand to silence everyone and nods her head towards Harry who goes to swing the large silver axe that cuts off Kara\u2019s head. Then Lucy hands him the torch that lights Kara\u2019s body in flames. </p><p>Next Lucy ties Harry to a pole with sterling silver cuffs holding him to it tightly and hands the silver whip to Alex who delivers 30 lashes to Harry\u2019s back that slices through his black shirt into his skin. Harry whimpers a few times but quickly stands tall when it\u2019s over. He makes eye contact with Y/N who looks at him sadly with tears in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s more a way of humiliating him than it is meant to actually harm him, as werewolves heal pretty quick. the silver will burn him sure, but the 30 days and nights in the Well will be painful. He\u2019s basically starving to death\u201d Niall explains to Y/N. </p><p>\u201cSo I cant help him at all the next little while?\u201d She asks Niall sadly. He nods then says \u201cabout our date, Listen pet since Calum marked you I\u2019m sure you understand that I\u2019m not going to be pursuing you while you wear his scent and mark. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d \u201cWait, how long do markings last for?\u201d \u201cRoughly a few months, unless you hit your heat. Then you can be freshly marked by another alpha.\u201d Y/N nods. </p><p>Guess she has to obey Calum now.  </p><p>\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40 </p></p>",

She goes to tap on his tent with her free hand, when he gruffly replies that he\u2019s awake. \u201cHi sorry Calum, I didn\u2019t really know where else to go. Is it okay if I stay the night here? My original plan was to sleep on the bench out by the path but thumper here wouldn\u2019t sit still enough and he peed on my shirt.\u201d She says as she lets thumper down and walks over to where Calum\u2019s sat. She smells the alcohol on his lips as she gets closer and Calum is looking at her with hooded eyes. \u201cCourse puppy, you can sleep with me, have the king size bed all to myself anyways so there\u2019s more than enough room\u201d he says with a sly smile and a pat to the bed. Y/N walks over and sits down on the spot he patted. \u201cCould I also borrow a shirt? I don\u2019t want to smell like bunny pee please\u201d she giggles quietly. \u201cCourse sweet girl here.\u201d He replies as he lifts the shirt he\u2019s currently wearing and gives it to her and turns his body away so she can change in privacy. \u201cYou want a drink puppy? I only have beer here at the moment\u201d </p><p> He turns back in time to see her nod her head and put her hair to the side. \u201cI think Harry and Kara mated?\u201d She says as she accepts the bottle. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works pet, they\u2019ll mate only when she\u2019s in heat then he\u2019ll be able to mate her, and since i haven\u2019t smelt a change coming from her I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re just fucking. Is that why you\u2019re out so late in your pjs?\u201d He asks, she nods. </p><p><br></p><p>After about 3 bottles Y/Ns feeling lightheaded, she\u2019s not drunk but she feels comfortable enough to fall back asleep without the sounds she heard from Harry playing in her head. </p><p>\u201cHere puppy under the blankets, it gets colder in a tent obviously but I have my little canvas stove running.\u201d Calum says as he tucks her in closer to him in the middle. He stands up and puts her shirt beside her side of the bed so thumper has something to lay on then sets up the pet pen he brought for her earlier but forgot to give it to her, he then sets thumper down in it. </p><p>After they\u2019re tucked in under the blankets both still wide awake, they begin talking about their plans for the coming week. Calum tells her how he\u2019ll need help bringing in bags of flour but none of the other alphas will be around since they\u2019re still working on ways to keep the pups warm. He\u2019s told her how last winter was so harsh they lost 3 pups due to the cold. So they want to take every measure so it doesn\u2019t happen this winter. \u201cHow come I can\u2019t come help you?\u201d She asks after thinking on it for a while. \u201cYou\u2019re still unmarked, you might attract rogue alphas, can\u2019t risk them coming close to the village or close to the city. It\u2019s about a 20 minute run in wolf form but carrying the flour back will need to be in human form which takes 2 hours. there\u2019s no other way and we\u2019ll both be at our most vulnerable so I can\u2019t protect you.\u201d Y/N stews on it a while longer and chews on her lip and turns to face him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you mark me?\u201d She asks shyly as she pets his chest. </p><p>Calum looks at her and put his hand on her cheek and rubs it with his thumb. \u201cSweet little puppy, you\u2019re ready to be marked?\u201d He asks her with his beer breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a little sting as I bite into you, are you sure your up for it?\u201d He goes to lift himself and hover over her as he waits for her reply. Y/N submits to him and moves to lay on her back under him and nods her head as she looks up at him. \u201cYes, please, Want more freedom Calum. Know you can give me that.\u201d She says as she rubs on his chest lowering her hand to his abs. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do this than\u201d he says as he lifts and pulls her head towards his and kisses her in a forceful manner. Y/N liking where this is heading, starts bucking her hips up towards his and he continues with kissing her then pushes between her legs till they\u2019re bent on either side of his hips and he ends the kiss and starts kissing down her cheek towards her neck. \u201cSmell so sweet puppy, all fresh for the taking huh?\u201d He asks as he licks into her neck. His hand goes under the shirt she\u2019s wearing and tugs on it till it\u2019s just over her breasts. \u201cSuch pretty tits too huh, cute nipples begging to be sucked on and bitten\u201d Calum says as he goes to take one of her nipples into his mouth. Y/N\u2019s body starts to writhe under him and her hand goes to lower the boxers he\u2019s wearing when he stops her. \u201c no puppy you don\u2019t get to touch me unless I tell you, omegas are good and still as the alpha takes what he needs. Promise I\u2019ll make you feel good as I do it.\u201d He says as he continues with lightly tugging her other nipple with his teeth. </p><p>Calum lifts the shirt off of her completely and sits up between her legs and helps her wiggle her shorts and panties off. \u201cGonna lick into you pet, been waiting patiently to since I first smelled you.\u201d He says as he lays down and throws her thighs on either side of his head. Calum starts licking and sucking into her core as Y/Ns whimpering and panting. She\u2019s holding onto the sheets with her fists as she begins bucking into his mouth. </p><p>Calum uses one finger and slides it inside her pussy as his thumb on his other hand begins rubbing little circles over her other tight hole. \u201cGonna have my way with your pretty bum puppy. Im guessing you haven\u2019t done that before?\u201d He asks her as she moans loudly, she nods her head and quickly adds she hasn\u2019t even had sex before as a human and Calum growls. The alpha side of him thats competitive adds another finger into her pussy scissoring her open the wetness leaking from her pussy acts as lube. \u201cGonna fucking ruin you puppy, fuck! I\u2019m gonna keep you for myself and fill you with my scent so no other alpha comes near you!\u201d He says and he goes to sit up he leans down and starts licking into her mouth,Y/N moans around his tongue as she tastes herself. Her body is on fire as she feels Calum settle on top of her. \u201cOkay pet going to slip inside and fill you while I mark you.\u201d He says in a heavy breath in her face. Y/N nods as her body tightens, she doesn\u2019t know what to expect. </p><p>\u201cSorry it\u2019s going to be a slow burn puppy\u201d he says as he pulls his leaking cock from his boxers, and starts painting up and down in slow strokes over her clit. He goes to kiss her to quiet her cries as he slowly starts pushing into her. Y/N\u2019s hands go to scratch his back as her eyes start to tear up, and she cries into his mouth. she can feel the burn he warned her about but it\u2019s also pleasurable as her sensitive nipples rub against his chest. \u201cSorry sweets, it\u2019ll start to feel good I swear it\u201d he says as he starts pumping into her tight core. Y/N lays there as Calum fucks into her, she waits for it to feel good like he says but it just hurts the entire time. Calum leans his head down and starts little kisses on her collarbone and sucking little hickeys into it when she feels his sharp teeth start to line up on her skin. \u201cWait Calum!\u201d She says in a panic voice when he bites down hard on her neck. Y/N screams as he licks the area and goes to line up and bites into the top part of her breast. Y/N is full on crying now as Calum pulls out, flips her onto her tummy and lifts her hips towards him as he lines up and pushes into her again. Y/N puts her face into the pillow as Calum starts to fuck her into the mattress with his heavy body. He lines up and bites her on her shoulder, then licks it like before, telling her it\u2019s to close the marking. \u201cGuess it hurts this time, haven\u2019t had a virgin before but I promise puppy it will feel good the next time\u201d he grunts.</p><p>After a full hour of Calum basically using her to get himself off, he pulls out and finishes on her back. Y/N curls into a ball on her side as her body still feels sore. \u201cSorry puppy. We\u2019ll wait a long while before I fuck into your tight bum.\u201d He says as he tucks himself into his boxers, he stands up and goes to grab a dirty towel and wipes away at the mess he made on her. \u201cSorry sweets.\u201d He says as he lays down and pulls her to him. </p><p>Y/N curls into him and wipes her watery eyes with her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Harry awakes the next morning late in the day, Kara is nowhere to be found and he notices the bedroom door is left open. He stands up and cleans the living room of any mess him and Kara made then walks over to the bedroom and knocks against the open door. No one answers so he heads to the bathroom, knocks on that door and no one answers. Harry then remembers making eye contact with Y/N who was stood by the front door and remembers seeing her leave. He could\u2019ve sworn that he imagined that last night considering he was balls deep in an omega so he can\u2019t rely on his memory for anything else. </p><p>Y/N wakes up next to Calum snoring quite loudly. Her body is covered in bruises from where Calum grabbed at her and dark purple marks where be bite her but it\u2019s not sore like she was expecting. </p><p>She goes to cover herself with the blanket and try to fall back asleep when she hears a muted tap come from the outside of the tent. \u201cHey Calum, you up? Have you seen Y/N?\u201d Harry shouts. Y/N panics and looks around the bed for her clothes when she hears his zipper open up and Harry pops his head in. She looks at him like a deer caught in the headlights, and he does the same. \u201cH-Hi Harry\u2026\u201d she says in a choked whisper. \u201cWhat are you doing here and where are your clothes!?\u201d He shouts as he enters the tent, waking Calum in the process. \u201cSup pal, what you doing here so early?\u201d Calum says with his one eye opened then closes it and covers his eyes with his arm. \u201cWhat the fuck? I told you to stay away from him and here you reeking of his scent!\u201d Harry says as he stomps toward her. He grabs her arm and pulls her out of the bed, still naked when he looks at the bruises lining her body. Y/Ns stood there shaking from the cold and Harry\u2019s harsh stare. \u201cyou fucking marked her?\u201d He says in disbelief. \u201cShe begged me to, she wants more freedom H she\u2019s coming with me to the city to grab more food supplies later this week.\u201d Calum says still not bothered. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to risk a rogue following us cause of her scent!\u201d He finishes. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold Harry could I get dressed please?\u201d Y/N asks but refuses to look at him.  </p><p>Harry looks disgusted at Calum then looks pitifully at Y/N. \u201ccourse you can puppy, here\u201d he says as he reaches down and takes the shirt off his body when he realizes thumper has peed on her pj shirt that\u2019s under him. He looks for her pj shorts and undies and helps her into them gently, careful not to touch any of her bruises. \u201cCome on puppy let\u2019s go home\u201d he says as he reaches for thumper who comes to his hand willingly. \u201cYou can clean the bunny shit up Calum, it\u2019s the least you can do after using her\u201d He says after Y/N leaves the tent. Calum huffs then rolls over to his stomach and easily falls back asleep. </p><p><br></p><p>Back at Harry\u2019s cabin he runs Y/N a bath, he grabs her clean clothes and towels and sets them down next to her. Y/N sits there on the bathroom counter where he set her and watches as he lines the tub with Epsom salts and her favourite body wash. \u201cCan I use the Epsom salts or will they burn me?\u201d She asks him as he stands. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean burn you? You\u2019ve used them before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, i imagine I\u2019ll have tears since this was my first time\u201d she shrugs. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any tears, remember I was there when you presented, your body pushed itself apart to fit an alphas.\u201d He says as he turns off the water and helps Y/N down from the counter. </p><p>\u201cNo I mean it was my first time, first time. Like I\u2019ve never had sex before\u2026\u201d she ends her sentence quieter than she began like she\u2019s embarrassed. \u201cAnd Calum was pretty\u2026. rough\u2026\u201d she looks down at her feet and twiddles her toes. \u201cYou were a virgin?\u201d He asks after standing there for a while. \u201cYou\u2026 that- Look pet, your first time definitely shouldn\u2019t have been with Calum. He\u2019s a good guy sure but he follows his animal biology when it comes to sex. I\u2019m sorry puppy you shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to that.\u201d Harry says as he lifts her head to look at him, \u201clet\u2019s forgo the Salts for now than hmm?\u201d He says and kisses her forehead. He closes the bathroom door and Y/N undresses and steps into the tub slowly soaking her tired body. </p><p><br></p><p>Later in the evening when Y/N\u2019s back in Harry\u2019s bed she awakes to a loud shouting coming from the daycare. Her omega instincts are quick to worry for the pups as she gets up and runs down the hill to the daycare. Where she sees Kara, Lucy, Niall, Jack, Calum, and Harry. Kara currently being held down to the ground on her stomach by Jack and Niall. Y/N runs passed them towards the pups in the daycare and is met by Catalina and another mated omega from the village. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on are the pups okay?\u201d She asks out of breath, still in a tank top and pj shorts. Catalina was quick to reassure her that they were okay and says \u201cKara\u2019s a rogue. Lucy\u2019s going to have her beheaded at dawn.\u201d Y/N looks at her then the other omega who nods her head telling her she heard right. \u201cWell what does that mean she\u2019s a rogue?\u201d \u201cRogues live to tear down villages. They go for the pups first. Once the pups are killed it depresses the pack into submission. Once they have a way in, then more will come till they kill us and overtake our village and resources.\u201d Catalina explains the shops Y/N into the den under the daycare where the pups are crying and her body tells her to comfort them. </p><p><br></p><p>After the pups are asleep Y/N comes out to Kara being put in a sterling silver cone around her head and her hands in matching handcuffs. \u201cTo keep her from shifting\u201d Niall explains. Y/N nods as she looks at everyone forming around Kara. \u201cSo who does the beheading?\u201d She asks him quietly, \u201cHarry will have to, he\u2019s the one that hid her scent with his and brought her in passed the vines\u201d He says and quickly adds \u201cHe will also go through some form of punishment that Lucy will go over with the village and once everyone agrees there\u2019s a good chance he might be kicked out of the village as well.\u201d Niall finishes as he walks away. Y/Ns stood there bewildered. Harry might be kicked out? </p><p>The next day. </p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s in agreement, 30 lashings for bringing and harbouring a rogue in the village.\u201d Lucy shouts over everyone at the town hall. Y/N is stood beside Catalina and Liam near the back of the pack. \u201cAs for banishment, it\u2019s in  agreement that for now, Harry stays. But, will be shunned for 30 days and 30 nights in the Well. Anyone seen talking to Harry will face being shunned too!\u201d Y/N stood there staring at Harry who was on the stage next to Lucy and Kara. his head hung low and face hidden behind his long hair. </p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019ll stay in the village?\u201d She asks as everyone disperses the town hall. Catalina nods and reply\u2019s \u201cpoor guy I understand the severity of a rogue entering, but I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s facing such a harsh punishment from Lucy. How was he to know the omega village was hiding a rogue!\u201d \u201cCome Catalina, it\u2019s getting late you\u2019re going home.\u201d Liam tells her and she listens right away. \u201cY/N! Come puppy you should be getting back too!\u201d Calum says as he goes to reach for her hand but she jerks it away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d She says to him with a glare. \u201cHarry said to stay away from you but you sure fooled me into thinking you\u2019d care for me in such a intimate way.\u201d She goes to walk away from him but he grabs at her arm \u201cyou listen to me when I\u2019m telling you something\u201d he says forcefully and she bows her head. \u201cHarry will be in the Well the next little while, I\u2019ll be taking care of you since I marked you. Now, go home and if you ever speak back to me in such a tone I\u2019ll have to punish you, you understand?\u201d </p><p>Y/N nods and let\u2019s Calum lead her back towards Harry\u2019s cabin. </p><p><br></p><p>The next dawn they march Kara and Harry to the hill where they behead rogues and unruly village members.  Harry was dressed in black as was Kara. Lucy waved her hand to silence everyone and nods her head towards Harry who goes to swing the large silver axe that cuts off Kara\u2019s head. Then Lucy hands him the torch that lights Kara\u2019s body in flames. </p><p>Next Lucy ties Harry to a pole with sterling silver cuffs holding him to it tightly and hands the silver whip to Alex who delivers 30 lashes to Harry\u2019s back that slices through his black shirt into his skin. Harry whimpers a few times but quickly stands tall when it\u2019s over. He makes eye contact with Y/N who looks at him sadly with tears in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s more a way of humiliating him than it is meant to actually harm him, as werewolves heal pretty quick. the silver will burn him sure, but the 30 days and nights in the Well will be painful. He\u2019s basically starving to death\u201d Niall explains to Y/N. </p><p>\u201cSo I cant help him at all the next little while?\u201d She asks Niall sadly. He nods then says \u201cabout our date, Listen pet since Calum marked you I\u2019m sure you understand that I\u2019m not going to be pursuing you while you wear his scent and mark. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d \u201cWait, how long do markings last for?\u201d \u201cRoughly a few months, unless you hit your heat. Then you can be freshly marked by another alpha.\u201d Y/N nods. </p><p>Guess she has to obey Calum now.  </p><p>\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40 </p></p>",

She goes to tap on his tent with her free hand, when he gruffly replies that he&rsquo;s awake. &ldquo;Hi sorry Calum, I didn&rsquo;t really know where else to go. Is it okay if I stay the night here? My original plan was to sleep on the bench out by the path but thumper here wouldn&rsquo;t sit still enough and he peed on my shirt.&rdquo; She says as she lets thumper down and walks over to where Calum&rsquo;s sat. She smells the alcohol on his lips as she gets closer and Calum is looking at her with hooded eyes. &ldquo;Course puppy, you can sleep with me, have the king size bed all to myself anyways so there&rsquo;s more than enough room&rdquo; he says with a sly smile and a pat to the bed. Y/N walks over and sits down on the spot he patted. &ldquo;Could I also borrow a shirt? I don&rsquo;t want to smell like bunny pee please&rdquo; she giggles quietly. &ldquo;Course sweet girl here.&rdquo; He replies as he lifts the shirt he&rsquo;s currently wearing and gives it to her and turns his body away so she can change in privacy. &ldquo;You want a drink puppy? I only have beer here at the moment&rdquo; </p><p> He turns back in time to see her nod her head and put her hair to the side. &ldquo;I think Harry and Kara mated?&rdquo; She says as she accepts the bottle. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how it works pet, they&rsquo;ll mate only when she&rsquo;s in heat then he&rsquo;ll be able to mate her, and since i haven&rsquo;t smelt a change coming from her I&rsquo;m assuming they&rsquo;re just fucking. Is that why you&rsquo;re out so late in your pjs?&rdquo; He asks, she nods. </p><p><br /></p><p>After about 3 bottles Y/Ns feeling lightheaded, she&rsquo;s not drunk but she feels comfortable enough to fall back asleep without the sounds she heard from Harry playing in her head. </p><p>&ldquo;Here puppy under the blankets, it gets colder in a tent obviously but I have my little canvas stove running.&rdquo; Calum says as he tucks her in closer to him in the middle. He stands up and puts her shirt beside her side of the bed so thumper has something to lay on then sets up the pet pen he brought for her earlier but forgot to give it to her, he then sets thumper down in it. </p><p>After they&rsquo;re tucked in under the blankets both still wide awake, they begin talking about their plans for the coming week. Calum tells her how he&rsquo;ll need help bringing in bags of flour but none of the other alphas will be around since they&rsquo;re still working on ways to keep the pups warm. He&rsquo;s told her how last winter was so harsh they lost 3 pups due to the cold. So they want to take every measure so it doesn&rsquo;t happen this winter. &ldquo;How come I can&rsquo;t come help you?&rdquo; She asks after thinking on it for a while. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still unmarked, you might attract rogue alphas, can&rsquo;t risk them coming close to the village or close to the city. It&rsquo;s about a 20 minute run in wolf form but carrying the flour back will need to be in human form which takes 2 hours. there&rsquo;s no other way and we&rsquo;ll both be at our most vulnerable so I can&rsquo;t protect you.&rdquo; Y/N stews on it a while longer and chews on her lip and turns to face him. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you mark me?&rdquo; She asks shyly as she pets his chest. </p><p>Calum looks at her and put his hand on her cheek and rubs it with his thumb. &ldquo;Sweet little puppy, you&rsquo;re ready to be marked?&rdquo; He asks her with his beer breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little sting as I bite into you, are you sure your up for it?&rdquo; He goes to lift himself and hover over her as he waits for her reply. Y/N submits to him and moves to lay on her back under him and nods her head as she looks up at him. &ldquo;Yes, please, Want more freedom Calum. Know you can give me that.&rdquo; She says as she rubs on his chest lowering her hand to his abs. &ldquo;Okay. Let&rsquo;s do this than&rdquo; he says as he lifts and pulls her head towards his and kisses her in a forceful manner. Y/N liking where this is heading, starts bucking her hips up towards his and he continues with kissing her then pushes between her legs till they&rsquo;re bent on either side of his hips and he ends the kiss and starts kissing down her cheek towards her neck. &ldquo;Smell so sweet puppy, all fresh for the taking huh?&rdquo; He asks as he licks into her neck. His hand goes under the shirt she&rsquo;s wearing and tugs on it till it&rsquo;s just over her breasts. &ldquo;Such pretty tits too huh, cute nipples begging to be sucked on and bitten&rdquo; Calum says as he goes to take one of her nipples into his mouth. Y/N&rsquo;s body starts to writhe under him and her hand goes to lower the boxers he&rsquo;s wearing when he stops her. &ldquo; no puppy you don&rsquo;t get to touch me unless I tell you, omegas are good and still as the alpha takes what he needs. Promise I&rsquo;ll make you feel good as I do it.&rdquo; He says as he continues with lightly tugging her other nipple with his teeth. </p><p>Calum lifts the shirt off of her completely and sits up between her legs and helps her wiggle her shorts and panties off. &ldquo;Gonna lick into you pet, been waiting patiently to since I first smelled you.&rdquo; He says as he lays down and throws her thighs on either side of his head. Calum starts licking and sucking into her core as Y/Ns whimpering and panting. She&rsquo;s holding onto the sheets with her fists as she begins bucking into his mouth. </p><p>Calum uses one finger and slides it inside her pussy as his thumb on his other hand begins rubbing little circles over her other tight hole. &ldquo;Gonna have my way with your pretty bum puppy. Im guessing you haven&rsquo;t done that before?&rdquo; He asks her as she moans loudly, she nods her head and quickly adds she hasn&rsquo;t even had sex before as a human and Calum growls. The alpha side of him thats competitive adds another finger into her pussy scissoring her open the wetness leaking from her pussy acts as lube. &ldquo;Gonna fucking ruin you puppy, fuck! I&rsquo;m gonna keep you for myself and fill you with my scent so no other alpha comes near you!&rdquo; He says and he goes to sit up he leans down and starts licking into her mouth,Y/N moans around his tongue as she tastes herself. Her body is on fire as she feels Calum settle on top of her. &ldquo;Okay pet going to slip inside and fill you while I mark you.&rdquo; He says in a heavy breath in her face. Y/N nods as her body tightens, she doesn&rsquo;t know what to expect. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry it&rsquo;s going to be a slow burn puppy&rdquo; he says as he pulls his leaking cock from his boxers, and starts painting up and down in slow strokes over her clit. He goes to kiss her to quiet her cries as he slowly starts pushing into her. Y/N&rsquo;s hands go to scratch his back as her eyes start to tear up, and she cries into his mouth. she can feel the burn he warned her about but it&rsquo;s also pleasurable as her sensitive nipples rub against his chest. &ldquo;Sorry sweets, it&rsquo;ll start to feel good I swear it&rdquo; he says as he starts pumping into her tight core. Y/N lays there as Calum fucks into her, she waits for it to feel good like he says but it just hurts the entire time. Calum leans his head down and starts little kisses on her collarbone and sucking little hickeys into it when she feels his sharp teeth start to line up on her skin. &ldquo;Wait Calum!&rdquo; She says in a panic voice when he bites down hard on her neck. Y/N screams as he licks the area and goes to line up and bites into the top part of her breast. Y/N is full on crying now as Calum pulls out, flips her onto her tummy and lifts her hips towards him as he lines up and pushes into her again. Y/N puts her face into the pillow as Calum starts to fuck her into the mattress with his heavy body. He lines up and bites her on her shoulder, then licks it like before, telling her it&rsquo;s to close the marking. &ldquo;Guess it hurts this time, haven&rsquo;t had a virgin before but I promise puppy it will feel good the next time&rdquo; he grunts.</p><p>After a full hour of Calum basically using her to get himself off, he pulls out and finishes on her back. Y/N curls into a ball on her side as her body still feels sore. &ldquo;Sorry puppy. We&rsquo;ll wait a long while before I fuck into your tight bum.&rdquo; He says as he tucks himself into his boxers, he stands up and goes to grab a dirty towel and wipes away at the mess he made on her. &ldquo;Sorry sweets.&rdquo; He says as he lays down and pulls her to him. </p><p>Y/N curls into him and wipes her watery eyes with her hands.</p><p><br /></p><p>Harry awakes the next morning late in the day, Kara is nowhere to be found and he notices the bedroom door is left open. He stands up and cleans the living room of any mess him and Kara made then walks over to the bedroom and knocks against the open door. No one answers so he heads to the bathroom, knocks on that door and no one answers. Harry then remembers making eye contact with Y/N who was stood by the front door and remembers seeing her leave. He could&rsquo;ve sworn that he imagined that last night considering he was balls deep in an omega so he can&rsquo;t rely on his memory for anything else. </p><p>Y/N wakes up next to Calum snoring quite loudly. Her body is covered in bruises from where Calum grabbed at her and dark purple marks where be bite her but it&rsquo;s not sore like she was expecting. </p><p>She goes to cover herself with the blanket and try to fall back asleep when she hears a muted tap come from the outside of the tent. &ldquo;Hey Calum, you up? Have you seen Y/N?&rdquo; Harry shouts. Y/N panics and looks around the bed for her clothes when she hears his zipper open up and Harry pops his head in. She looks at him like a deer caught in the headlights, and he does the same. &ldquo;H-Hi Harry&hellip;&rdquo; she says in a choked whisper. &ldquo;What are you doing here and where are your clothes!?&rdquo; He shouts as he enters the tent, waking Calum in the process. &ldquo;Sup pal, what you doing here so early?&rdquo; Calum says with his one eye opened then closes it and covers his eyes with his arm. &ldquo;What the fuck? I told you to stay away from him and here you reeking of his scent!&rdquo; Harry says as he stomps toward her. He grabs her arm and pulls her out of the bed, still naked when he looks at the bruises lining her body. Y/Ns stood there shaking from the cold and Harry&rsquo;s harsh stare. &ldquo;you fucking marked her?&rdquo; He says in disbelief. &ldquo;She begged me to, she wants more freedom H she&rsquo;s coming with me to the city to grab more food supplies later this week.&rdquo; Calum says still not bothered. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to risk a rogue following us cause of her scent!&rdquo; He finishes. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold Harry could I get dressed please?&rdquo; Y/N asks but refuses to look at him.  </p><p>Harry looks disgusted at Calum then looks pitifully at Y/N. &ldquo;course you can puppy, here&rdquo; he says as he reaches down and takes the shirt off his body when he realizes thumper has peed on her pj shirt that&rsquo;s under him. He looks for her pj shorts and undies and helps her into them gently, careful not to touch any of her bruises. &ldquo;Come on puppy let&rsquo;s go home&rdquo; he says as he reaches for thumper who comes to his hand willingly. &ldquo;You can clean the bunny shit up Calum, it&rsquo;s the least you can do after using her&rdquo; He says after Y/N leaves the tent. Calum huffs then rolls over to his stomach and easily falls back asleep. </p><p><br /></p><p>Back at Harry&rsquo;s cabin he runs Y/N a bath, he grabs her clean clothes and towels and sets them down next to her. Y/N sits there on the bathroom counter where he set her and watches as he lines the tub with Epsom salts and her favourite body wash. &ldquo;Can I use the Epsom salts or will they burn me?&rdquo; She asks him as he stands. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean burn you? You&rsquo;ve used them before.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, i imagine I&rsquo;ll have tears since this was my first time&rdquo; she shrugs. &ldquo;There shouldn&rsquo;t be any tears, remember I was there when you presented, your body pushed itself apart to fit an alphas.&rdquo; He says as he turns off the water and helps Y/N down from the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;No I mean it was my first time, first time. Like I&rsquo;ve never had sex before&hellip;&rdquo; she ends her sentence quieter than she began like she&rsquo;s embarrassed. &ldquo;And Calum was pretty&hellip;. rough&hellip;&rdquo; she looks down at her feet and twiddles her toes. &ldquo;You were a virgin?&rdquo; He asks after standing there for a while. &ldquo;You&hellip; that- Look pet, your first time definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have been with Calum. He&rsquo;s a good guy sure but he follows his animal biology when it comes to sex. I&rsquo;m sorry puppy you shouldn&rsquo;t have been subjected to that.&rdquo; Harry says as he lifts her head to look at him, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s forgo the Salts for now than hmm?&rdquo; He says and kisses her forehead. He closes the bathroom door and Y/N undresses and steps into the tub slowly soaking her tired body. </p><p><br /></p><p>Later in the evening when Y/N&rsquo;s back in Harry&rsquo;s bed she awakes to a loud shouting coming from the daycare. Her omega instincts are quick to worry for the pups as she gets up and runs down the hill to the daycare. Where she sees Kara, Lucy, Niall, Jack, Calum, and Harry. Kara currently being held down to the ground on her stomach by Jack and Niall. Y/N runs passed them towards the pups in the daycare and is met by Catalina and another mated omega from the village. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on are the pups okay?&rdquo; She asks out of breath, still in a tank top and pj shorts. Catalina was quick to reassure her that they were okay and says &ldquo;Kara&rsquo;s a rogue.

Once they have a way in, then more will come till they kill us and overtake our village and resources.&rdquo; Catalina explains the shops Y/N into the den under the daycare where the pups are crying and her body tells her to comfort them. </p><p><br /></p><p>After the pups are asleep Y/N comes out to Kara being put in a sterling silver cone around her head and her hands in matching handcuffs. &ldquo;To keep her from shifting&rdquo; Niall explains. Y/N nods as she looks at everyone forming around Kara. &ldquo;So who does the beheading?&rdquo; She asks him quietly, &ldquo;Harry will have to, he&rsquo;s the one that hid her scent with his and brought her in passed the vines&rdquo; He says and quickly adds &ldquo;He will also go through some form of punishment that Lucy will go over with the village and once everyone agrees there&rsquo;s a good chance he might be kicked out of the village as well.&rdquo; Niall finishes as he walks away.

How was he to know the omega village was hiding a rogue!&rdquo; &ldquo;Come Catalina, it&rsquo;s getting late you&rsquo;re going home.&rdquo; Liam tells her and she listens right away. &ldquo;Y/N!
