It\u2019s gotten warmer over the last month, so Phil no longer has to feel as guilty about the hoards of people shivering in their skimpy outfits for hours in the freezing seaside air, but it\u2019s still not fun being the guy who has to make them all wait. Strict club rules though - no more than fifteen people to be let in at once, staggered in five minute intervals. </p><p>A few people are trying to engage Phil in chatter, but he remains stoic and silent, arms folded just below the stitching on his tight black t-shirt that reads \u2018Try It Mate\u2019. The people at the front of the queue, a girl in tattered tights and a birthday sash flanked by two equally bimbo-ish friends, are finding this t-shirt hilarious, and keep yelling this at him, as if they actually think he can\u2019t hear them standing two feet away. He\u2019s had a lot of practice at ignoring drunken screeching though, so he just stares at the roiling sea in the distance, fast-forwarding his brain a few hours, to when he can relax in his bed, eat leftover pizza and play some video game he could complete blindfolded. </p><p>Billy, the other bouncer working tonight, taps Phil discreetly on the arm - the signal that enough time has passed to let some more people in. With a quiet sigh, Phil turns and unhooks the rope separating him from the drunk girls, and inclines his head to let them through. As they stumble inside the door, flashing their passports and driver\u2019s licences, Billy makes a disapproving face. Phil knows that some bouncers would label the girls as \u2018TDTD\u2019 (too drunk to dance), and not let them inside, but Phil can\u2019t be bothered to go through that whole charade with them. They look the sort that would kick off, and hold up the queue even more. They\u2019re straight, probably, out on a girls night for the sash-girl\u2019s birthday, and fancy trying out a gay club just to be daring. It pisses Phil off, and if he were more like Billy, weathered by years of the job and willing to take no nonsense, he might be more inclined to refuse them entry. </p><p>But it\u2019s too late now, they\u2019re already inside, likely ordering prosecco at a bar that serves mostly jagerbombs and cheap imitation cosmos, then clambering up on the podiums with the professional dancers and drag queens to show off for their Instagram feed. Billy nudges him in the side, and Phil realises he\u2019s still watching the entrance where the girls disappeared, and not focusing on the queue. He turns quickly to the next person - tall, skinny, dressed in a crop top that looks like it\u2019s made for a doll, a thin, satin, pink and white bomber jacket, and a pair of denim shorts so tiny that they barely begin to cover the person\u2019s ass. The highlight of the ensemble is the lilac wig that cascades in loose curls down to waist-level, complete with a thick fringe that hangs down over whoever\u2019s eyes are hiding behind it. </p><p>Phil takes one look at this joker and has half a mind to turn them away without even speaking to them, but a skinny arm reaches up to offer an ID, so Phil sighs and takes it even though every one of his spidey-senses is tingling. It\u2019s a green driver\u2019s permit, not even a full license; the date printed would make the owner twenty-one. Phil gives the lanky figure in front of him another brief once-over - no way are they a day over eighteen, and that\u2019s pushing it. His eyes flick to the name: Daniel James Howell. There\u2019s a photo too of course, of an attractive, far more masculine-presenting, clean-cut young adult with a slight side-fringe. The lilac-haired beauty in front of Phil does not, in his opinion, match this general look. Still, he supposes it\u2019s his job to make sure. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Phil asks, starting off easy so he doesn\u2019t humiliate the kid. </p><p>\u201cI guess you could call me Dan, most of the time,\u201d lilac-hair says in an unexpectedly sure, confident voice; Phil can\u2019t be sure whether the tremor he can hear is in from cold or from their nerves about being caught. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound very sure about that.\u201d </p><p>They get a lot of this kind of thing. Young, nervous gay guys - it\u2019s mostly guys - sneaking out to come for their first gay club experience, usually dressed up in their mum or sister\u2019s clothes, disguised but still scared shitless that someone will clock them and they\u2019ll be forced prematurely out of the closet. This kid is likely still in school, desperate to find a place he can be himself - unfortunately, the law is the law, and he\u2019ll just have to come back when he\u2019s old enough to have a real ID. </p><p>\u201cThink I don\u2019t know my own name?\u201d the kid asks. \u201cListen, from nine to five, my name\u2019s Dan Howell. But I\u2019m not going by Dan tonight, get me?\u201d </p><p>The irritation in this person\u2019s voice makes Phil pause. Normally, a bad attitude like this would be enough of a deterrent that they\u2019d risk getting turned away, but if anything, on lilac-hair the attitude is just confusing. What does he have to be irritated about? He\u2019s got no gaggle of friends with him, nor does he appear to be in a hurry. Phil\u2019s just trying to do his job - if this person is underage, they must\u2019ve known this might happen. </p><p>He studies the ID again, noting that for a fake it\u2019s very convincing. He turns to flash the small green card at Billy, who frowns at it, then shrugs in a \u2018looks real to me\u2019 way. Phil\u2019s gaze drifts back to lilac-hair and asks, \u201cwhat\u2019s your star sign?\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile spreads over thin, glossed pink lips. \u201cIs that the best you can come up with?\u201d </p><p>Absurdly, Phil feels himself grow warm with embarrassment. It makes no sense - he\u2019s been flirted with hundreds of times working here and it\u2019s never so much as rattled him before. He shrugs it off, trying to appear unamused. \u201cI\u2019m not flirting with you, I\u2019m trying to see if you\u2019re fucking about with me. Might wanna play along, sunshine.\u201d </p><p>The pink lips part to let out a sigh of frustration. \u201cI\u2019m a gemini. Wanna know my bra size too?\u201d</p><p>The dates on the ID work; Phil long ago learned the correct dates for the star signs for this exact reason. He ignores the snarky follow up question, which is good of him. \u201cCan you lift your wig, please?\u201d</p><p>Lilac-hair hesitates, then flicks the long locks falling by their ears back over each shoulder, revealing a lot of pale skin and sharp, jutting collarbones. Phil averts his eyes quickly - if this person is underage, he can\u2019t be staring inappropriately. Not that he should be doing that with any customers that are legal either. </p><p>\u201cNot like that,\u201d Phil says, brusquely, \u201cI can\u2019t see your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Lilac-hair lifts their head, chin jutting out, and behind the unbrushed lilac strands, Phil can almost make out two dark, almond-shaped eyes staring back at him. Phil can\u2019t help an amused smile forcing its way out, born from the kid\u2019s stubborn defiance. This person is not about to let Phil off easily, if they are lying about their age. </p><p>So, mostly to speed things along, Phil reaches out a hand - very much without thinking - and pushes the purple fringe back. The kid\u2019s eyes are round and startled, which is fair enough, as Phil hadn\u2019t even known he was going to make such a bold move until he\u2019d already done it. This is far from protocol, probably, touching the customers unless they\u2019re being belligerent and require forcible removal. But he\u2019s too far in now, holding the handful of acrylic hair out of this person\u2019s face. And yep, it\u2019s at once completely obvious that he is, in fact, the same person as the man in the ID photo - no question about it. </p><p>The ID is, apparently, real. Lilac hair is twenty-one years of age, and Phil\u2019s just got to accept it. Not a kid at all. He releases the fringe, and lilac-hair blinks as it falls back into their eyes. </p><p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d Lilac hair huffs, straightening the fringe with their fingers. </p><p>\u201cIn you go,\u201d is all Phil replies, a little gruffly because he knows he\u2019d been wrong to prematurely assume this person was trying to break the law from appearance alone. He hates that his own prejudice can sometimes leak through when assessing people in this job, though he tries his hardest to be totally impartial. He hands \u2018Dan\u2019 their ID back and lets them through the rope. Lilac-hair takes their time about going through, pulling the wig back around his shoulders, then swaying their hips as they swan by. Despite knowing he shouldn\u2019t, Phil\u2019s eyes fall to the curve of \u00a0lilac\u2019s ass, peeking through the hotpants as they head to the door. Phil never wears wigs, but he sees a lot of people in them working here, and long ago learned the difference between a cheap \u2018party city\u2019 wig, and an expensive one. The one lilac is wearing is definitely on the cheaper end of the scale, but it\u2019s gorgeous in its tackiness, like the person inside it knows that the pastel colour is exactly their shade. The plastic hair falls in a great tumble down a tapered back, bouncing just above the waistband of those tiny shorts. The sight is unforgettable, Phil can already feel it burning into his retinas, to be replayed in the dark, when he\u2019s alone. </p><p>Billy clears his throat then, breaking Phil out of his trance. He rips his eyes away, sheepishly, turning to Billy. \u201cNot a good idea to put your hands on \u2018em,\u201d Billy reminds him in his low, rough voice. \u201cSome of \u2018em get shirty about it.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, glad of the darkness hiding his flush, and turns to the next set of people in the queue. </p><p>*</p><p>At around half one, Phil signals to Billy that he needs to take a piss. The queue is long gone by now, and they\u2019ve moved into the second half of their shift, which is watching the smoking area for people trying to do drugs, and kicking people to the kerb if they get too drunk. There haven\u2019t been too many of either instances this evening, so Phil feels pretty safe about leaving Billy alone for five minutes. He heads inside, scooting behind the bar to get across to the toilets so that he doesn\u2019t have to barge through the crowds on the dancefloor. The bartenders all nod at him as he passes, some exchanging harried looks with him because it\u2019s rammed in here, and they all spent the first few hours of the night making two of every drinks order. </p><p>In the unisex bathroom, Phil pees quickly then washes his hands; he notices a few people scarpering from cubicles at the sight of him, but doesn\u2019t bother try and catch them. They\u2019re either doing drugs or having sex, and either one is moronic to do in a bathroom stall if you ask him. He does do a quick scout of the cubicles before he leaves, knocking on doors and saying stern things in the hopes of scaring them into sense for a bit. </p><p>It\u2019ll only work for a while - once they know he\u2019s out of sight they\u2019ll be back at it again, but there\u2019s not much he can do about it. They check likely suspects for pills and powders on the way in, and confiscate a fair amount, but Phil\u2019s not dumb and knows there\u2019s a hundred ways they could be hiding it. </p><p>It\u2019s as he gets to the bar again that Phil notices the swirling lights washing over a familiar waterfall of lilac, in front of the bar waiting to be served. There\u2019s a guy next to lilac hair, obnoxiously crowding them in a way that Phil is all too familiar with. The guy has a wifebeater on with the word \u2018woof\u2019 scrawled across the chest. He\u2019s also wearing a snapback indoors. Both of these are major red flags for Phil, who has seen and kicked out a lot of classic douchebags in his time. </p><p>He pauses, waiting to see the scene unfold. The bartenders are swamped with orders from the hoard of people crammed up against the bar - lilac has been pushed right to the edge with woof-man. Unless he\u2019s willing to give up his place in the makeshift queue, he won\u2019t be able to escape unwanted advances. Phil waits, certain that woof is seconds away from making his pig-headed move. He doesn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>Woof-man leans in and whispers something into the folds of the lilac wig. Whatever is said makes lilac recoil in disgust. To stop him moving away, woof-man reaches out and grabs lilac-hair by the outer hip, his meaty hand cupping the whole of his right ass-cheek, then tugs him in sharply. Already Phil is moving towards them at the sight of this, and that\u2019s when woof-man squeezes his fistful of flesh, apparently quite hard, because in the next second, lilac is calmly reaching between two people to grab a leftover beer on the bar, and promptly upending it over woof\u2019s head. The guy roars, half-drowned by the loud music, but audible enough that the near vicinity of people turn to see. Woof pulls off his snapback and shakes it out, furious; lilac flinches as the droplets of beer spray at him, but doesn\u2019t try to run away. Phil reaches them then, alarm pumping through him to the beat of a Tove Lo song, and promptly inserts himself between the two, his back to lilac, one hand on woof\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cOi, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Phil barks in his usual \u2018bouncer voice\u2019. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him not me!\u201d Woof insists, as Phil knew he would. \u201cThat little fucker chucked a beer on me!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOut of nowhere, was it?\u201d Phil\u2019s already done with this dickhead. \u201cI saw you grab \u2018em, so don\u2019t even try it. Far as I\u2019m concerned, you deserve the beer bath.\u201d </p><p>Woof\u2019s face flushes red in fury. \u201cOh, get lost, you wanker. Look at \u2018im. Boys don\u2019t dress like that to be treated like Royalty, mate. He fuckin\u2019 wants it.\u201d </p><p>A white hot, blinding rage pierces Phil right through the chest. Something primal awakens in him, picturing lilac\u2019s sweet, pretty features as he lifted the fringe from their eyes. \u201cRight,\u201d Phil growls through clenched teeth, \u201cout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Woof is practically frothing at the mouth. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bloody well can mate,\u201d Phil says; he\u2019s hoping that woof will listen to him, as he\u2019s seconds away from throwing a punch, \u201cI\u2019m the bouncer. Out. We don\u2019t want your sort in here.\u201d </p><p>The guy scoffs, squaring up, but he\u2019s wobbly, obviously tipsy, and Phil just has to take one sombre, utterly unfazed step towards him, shoulders drawn up to elevate their height difference, and the guy sinks backwards. Phil loves watching the recalculating whirr of their slowly ticking, moronic brains. </p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d the guy spits, sending a dirty look over Phil\u2019s shoulder, \u201cthis place is shite anyway.\u201d </p><p>Thankfully, he turns, stalking away, and Phil watches long enough to make sure he heads for the door. Once he\u2019s out of sight, Phil turns, somewhat unsurely, back to lilac, who is staring at Phil, the fringe parted into two curtains that split in curves across a smooth forehead. It\u2019s nice to see those eyes again; they shouldn\u2019t be hidden, Phil thinks.. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d lilac says. \u201cBut I could\u2019ve handled it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo trouble,\u201d Phil replies, chuckling at lilac\u2019s continued defiance, \u201c\u2018s what I\u2019m here for. You ok?\u201d </p><p>Lilac nods contemplatively, those brown eyes flicking over Phil\u2019s face, head tilted. He\u2019s wearing makeup, Phil notices. Something sparkly wiped across his eyelids and cheeks. Pink lipgloss. Maybe mascara too. Phil feels a curl of something he hasn\u2019t felt for a long time, twisting and writhing like a worm in his gut. He squashes it down, embarrassed by his attraction to such an obvious display of faux-feminine allure. Such a cliche, lusting after the pretty boys, or not-boys perhaps, considering what \u2018Dan\u2019 had said outside. </p><p>\u201cBet you get that problem a lot,\u201d Phil says, not thinking. He only realises how much like a come-on it sounds when it\u2019s too late. </p><p>Lilac\u2019s eyebrow quirks, and the corner of his mouth twitches up in a surprised smile. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re not flirting with me?\u201d </p><p>The blush whips into Phil\u2019s cheeks so fast it nearly unstables him. He\u2019s suddenly very aware of the intense effect this person seems to be having on him, just due to their proximity. Sure, beneath the overpowering performance of that wig lies an extraordinarily pretty human, but Phil daily encounters lots of beautiful people in this job. Gay club patrons tend to go ham on the glitz and glamour. </p><p>It\u2019s just something about lilac, in their skimpy clothes that look like they were stitched out of a teenage girl\u2019s bedroom curtains, and the cheap synthetic that somehow transforms the outfit into something bewitching. The makeup is done imperfectly, the sparkly blue varnish on their nails is \u00a0half bitten off. But there\u2019s no denying the effect lilac has, and seems to know they have, judging by the flirtatious smile being aimed his way. </p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Phil says anyway, bristling. He averts his eyes; lilac\u2019s stare is lasering right through him. \u201cI work here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d lilac replies, one bony shoulder shrugging up. Fingers come up to tuck a strand of wig behind an ear, revealing a glinting diamond stud, big and gaudy, in one lobe. \u201cAs of about ten minutes ago.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s half sure he\u2019s misheard, perhaps due to dizzying effect this person seems to be having on him, as if lilac\u2019s fingers are plucking at every thread stitching him together, unravelling him bit by bit. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve taken me on. Probationary only for now, but I\u2019ll convince them soon enough,\u201d lilac says, then finally catches the eye of Melissa, their head bartender. Lilac mouths \u2018sambucca\u2019 at her, then holds up two fingers; she nods, glancing at Phil as if to say \u2018did you really let this child in through the front door?\u2019. \u00a0\u201cI do drag,\u201d lilac says, teeth and tongue teasing out the word. \u201cOr a kind of drag, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil says, dumbed. He\u2019s not sure what a \u2018kind of\u2019 drag could mean, but there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s an intriguing thought. \u201cRight.\u201d </p><p>Under normal circumstances, Phil would find it more than suspicious that anyone in a cheap wig and very basic outfit, someone barely manage to squeeze past the bouncers in here tonight due to their youthful appearance, could have somehow secured a highly coveted spot amongst some of the best drag acts in Brighton. This club is known for its regular, popular drag performances, happening on Fridays and Saturdays. Phil hadn\u2019t even known the manager was looking for new talent - usually they hold auditions and have a long selection process, so the idea that someone would be able to walk in off the street and find work is almost unfathomable. </p><p>But these circumstances aren\u2019t normal. Lilac is not just another drag act, Phil can sense it. If they\u2019re able to hypnotise Phil, snatch him up body and soul with just a flutter of lashes and a few coy smiles, it\u2019s almost terrifying to think what lilac could do to a whole room of people. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>very</i> good,\u201d lilac says then around a knowing smile, so confident that Phil just nods in total acceptance. </p><p>Melissa pushes two shot glasses across the bar towards them, then shouts that it\u2019ll be six pounds. Lilac starts digging into some non-existent pocket in those shorts; to stop himself staring, Phil cups a hand around his mouth and shouts to Melissa, \u201cput it on my tab.\u201d</p><p>Lilac\u2019s eyes flick up to him through a haze of pastel. \u201cThanks,\u201d is the response, before they pick up the shots and down both of them one after the other. Phil blinks, chastened. Of course he wasn\u2019t certain that this jewel of a person was attempting to by him a drink, especially as they know Phil is working, but even so\u2026 it had sort of looked that way for a minute. Lilac flicks their lashes about, bored, then lands a chocolate gaze back on Phil. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you around, then.\u201d </p><p>Lilac pushes off the bar, already headed into the midst of the throng. The sight of the lilac covered back retreating is almost unbearable. Phil\u2019s arm shoots out before he can stop it, catching lilac\u2019s arm. Lilac snatches it away quickly, probably way too used to being grabbed at, and Phil feels slimy, holds his hands up in a show of surrender. Lilac has turned on the spot, is staring at him expectantly, warily. </p><p>There\u2019s no in point in asking Phil why he\u2019d felt the urge to halt this person\u2019s exit, because he has no idea. He just needed one last, proper, good look at those beautiful, beguiling features before he had to bid farewell for an indefinite amount of time. </p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d lilac asks, though because of the music, Phil can only tell what they\u2019d said by how those pink lips shaped the word. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Phil asks, for lack of anything better. Anything to prolong the inevitable parting of ways. \u201cYour drag name,\u201d Phil clarifies, hoping it\u2019s the right question.</p><p>It seems to make lilac smile, if only slightly. They shift their weight onto one foot, hip jutting out to the side. A gauze of blue passes diagonally over their face, highlighting the gleam in their eyes. </p><p>\u201cO-livia Truth,\u201d he says slowly, enunciating each syllable. \u201cI start on Friday. Blow me a kiss from the crowd.\u201d Then, with a spin on a pink stiletto, they\u2019re gone. </p>",

It\u2019s gotten warmer over the last month, so Phil no longer has to feel as guilty about the hoards of people shivering in their skimpy outfits for hours in the freezing seaside air, but it\u2019s still not fun being the guy who has to make them all wait. Strict club rules though - no more than fifteen people to be let in at once, staggered in five minute intervals. </p><p>A few people are trying to engage Phil in chatter, but he remains stoic and silent, arms folded just below the stitching on his tight black t-shirt that reads \u2018Try It Mate\u2019. The people at the front of the queue, a girl in tattered tights and a birthday sash flanked by two equally bimbo-ish friends, are finding this t-shirt hilarious, and keep yelling this at him, as if they actually think he can\u2019t hear them standing two feet away. He\u2019s had a lot of practice at ignoring drunken screeching though, so he just stares at the roiling sea in the distance, fast-forwarding his brain a few hours, to when he can relax in his bed, eat leftover pizza and play some video game he could complete blindfolded. </p><p>Billy, the other bouncer working tonight, taps Phil discreetly on the arm - the signal that enough time has passed to let some more people in. With a quiet sigh, Phil turns and unhooks the rope separating him from the drunk girls, and inclines his head to let them through. As they stumble inside the door, flashing their passports and driver\u2019s licences, Billy makes a disapproving face. Phil knows that some bouncers would label the girls as \u2018TDTD\u2019 (too drunk to dance), and not let them inside, but Phil can\u2019t be bothered to go through that whole charade with them. They look the sort that would kick off, and hold up the queue even more. They\u2019re straight, probably, out on a girls night for the sash-girl\u2019s birthday, and fancy trying out a gay club just to be daring. It pisses Phil off, and if he were more like Billy, weathered by years of the job and willing to take no nonsense, he might be more inclined to refuse them entry. </p><p>But it\u2019s too late now, they\u2019re already inside, likely ordering prosecco at a bar that serves mostly jagerbombs and cheap imitation cosmos, then clambering up on the podiums with the professional dancers and drag queens to show off for their Instagram feed. Billy nudges him in the side, and Phil realises he\u2019s still watching the entrance where the girls disappeared, and not focusing on the queue. He turns quickly to the next person - tall, skinny, dressed in a crop top that looks like it\u2019s made for a doll, a thin, satin, pink and white bomber jacket, and a pair of denim shorts so tiny that they barely begin to cover the person\u2019s ass. The highlight of the ensemble is the lilac wig that cascades in loose curls down to waist-level, complete with a thick fringe that hangs down over whoever\u2019s eyes are hiding behind it. </p><p>Phil takes one look at this joker and has half a mind to turn them away without even speaking to them, but a skinny arm reaches up to offer an ID, so Phil sighs and takes it even though every one of his spidey-senses is tingling. It\u2019s a green driver\u2019s permit, not even a full license; the date printed would make the owner twenty-one. Phil gives the lanky figure in front of him another brief once-over - no way are they a day over eighteen, and that\u2019s pushing it. His eyes flick to the name: Daniel James Howell. There\u2019s a photo too of course, of an attractive, far more masculine-presenting, clean-cut young adult with a slight side-fringe. The lilac-haired beauty in front of Phil does not, in his opinion, match this general look. Still, he supposes it\u2019s his job to make sure. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Phil asks, starting off easy so he doesn\u2019t humiliate the kid. </p><p>\u201cI guess you could call me Dan, most of the time,\u201d lilac-hair says in an unexpectedly sure, confident voice; Phil can\u2019t be sure whether the tremor he can hear is in from cold or from their nerves about being caught. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound very sure about that.\u201d </p><p>They get a lot of this kind of thing. Young, nervous gay guys - it\u2019s mostly guys - sneaking out to come for their first gay club experience, usually dressed up in their mum or sister\u2019s clothes, disguised but still scared shitless that someone will clock them and they\u2019ll be forced prematurely out of the closet. This kid is likely still in school, desperate to find a place he can be himself - unfortunately, the law is the law, and he\u2019ll just have to come back when he\u2019s old enough to have a real ID. </p><p>\u201cThink I don\u2019t know my own name?\u201d the kid asks. \u201cListen, from nine to five, my name\u2019s Dan Howell. But I\u2019m not going by Dan tonight, get me?\u201d </p><p>The irritation in this person\u2019s voice makes Phil pause. Normally, a bad attitude like this would be enough of a deterrent that they\u2019d risk getting turned away, but if anything, on lilac-hair the attitude is just confusing. What does he have to be irritated about? He\u2019s got no gaggle of friends with him, nor does he appear to be in a hurry. Phil\u2019s just trying to do his job - if this person is underage, they must\u2019ve known this might happen. </p><p>He studies the ID again, noting that for a fake it\u2019s very convincing. He turns to flash the small green card at Billy, who frowns at it, then shrugs in a \u2018looks real to me\u2019 way. Phil\u2019s gaze drifts back to lilac-hair and asks, \u201cwhat\u2019s your star sign?\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile spreads over thin, glossed pink lips. \u201cIs that the best you can come up with?\u201d </p><p>Absurdly, Phil feels himself grow warm with embarrassment. It makes no sense - he\u2019s been flirted with hundreds of times working here and it\u2019s never so much as rattled him before. He shrugs it off, trying to appear unamused. \u201cI\u2019m not flirting with you, I\u2019m trying to see if you\u2019re fucking about with me. Might wanna play along, sunshine.\u201d </p><p>The pink lips part to let out a sigh of frustration. \u201cI\u2019m a gemini. Wanna know my bra size too?\u201d</p><p>The dates on the ID work; Phil long ago learned the correct dates for the star signs for this exact reason. He ignores the snarky follow up question, which is good of him. \u201cCan you lift your wig, please?\u201d</p><p>Lilac-hair hesitates, then flicks the long locks falling by their ears back over each shoulder, revealing a lot of pale skin and sharp, jutting collarbones. Phil averts his eyes quickly - if this person is underage, he can\u2019t be staring inappropriately. Not that he should be doing that with any customers that are legal either. </p><p>\u201cNot like that,\u201d Phil says, brusquely, \u201cI can\u2019t see your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Lilac-hair lifts their head, chin jutting out, and behind the unbrushed lilac strands, Phil can almost make out two dark, almond-shaped eyes staring back at him. Phil can\u2019t help an amused smile forcing its way out, born from the kid\u2019s stubborn defiance. This person is not about to let Phil off easily, if they are lying about their age. </p><p>So, mostly to speed things along, Phil reaches out a hand - very much without thinking - and pushes the purple fringe back. The kid\u2019s eyes are round and startled, which is fair enough, as Phil hadn\u2019t even known he was going to make such a bold move until he\u2019d already done it. This is far from protocol, probably, touching the customers unless they\u2019re being belligerent and require forcible removal. But he\u2019s too far in now, holding the handful of acrylic hair out of this person\u2019s face. And yep, it\u2019s at once completely obvious that he is, in fact, the same person as the man in the ID photo - no question about it. </p><p>The ID is, apparently, real. Lilac hair is twenty-one years of age, and Phil\u2019s just got to accept it. Not a kid at all. He releases the fringe, and lilac-hair blinks as it falls back into their eyes. </p><p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d Lilac hair huffs, straightening the fringe with their fingers. </p><p>\u201cIn you go,\u201d is all Phil replies, a little gruffly because he knows he\u2019d been wrong to prematurely assume this person was trying to break the law from appearance alone. He hates that his own prejudice can sometimes leak through when assessing people in this job, though he tries his hardest to be totally impartial. He hands \u2018Dan\u2019 their ID back and lets them through the rope. Lilac-hair takes their time about going through, pulling the wig back around his shoulders, then swaying their hips as they swan by. Despite knowing he shouldn\u2019t, Phil\u2019s eyes fall to the curve of \u00a0lilac\u2019s ass, peeking through the hotpants as they head to the door. Phil never wears wigs, but he sees a lot of people in them working here, and long ago learned the difference between a cheap \u2018party city\u2019 wig, and an expensive one. The one lilac is wearing is definitely on the cheaper end of the scale, but it\u2019s gorgeous in its tackiness, like the person inside it knows that the pastel colour is exactly their shade. The plastic hair falls in a great tumble down a tapered back, bouncing just above the waistband of those tiny shorts. The sight is unforgettable, Phil can already feel it burning into his retinas, to be replayed in the dark, when he\u2019s alone. </p><p>Billy clears his throat then, breaking Phil out of his trance. He rips his eyes away, sheepishly, turning to Billy. \u201cNot a good idea to put your hands on \u2018em,\u201d Billy reminds him in his low, rough voice. \u201cSome of \u2018em get shirty about it.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, glad of the darkness hiding his flush, and turns to the next set of people in the queue. </p><p>*</p><p>At around half one, Phil signals to Billy that he needs to take a piss. The queue is long gone by now, and they\u2019ve moved into the second half of their shift, which is watching the smoking area for people trying to do drugs, and kicking people to the kerb if they get too drunk. There haven\u2019t been too many of either instances this evening, so Phil feels pretty safe about leaving Billy alone for five minutes. He heads inside, scooting behind the bar to get across to the toilets so that he doesn\u2019t have to barge through the crowds on the dancefloor. The bartenders all nod at him as he passes, some exchanging harried looks with him because it\u2019s rammed in here, and they all spent the first few hours of the night making two of every drinks order. </p><p>In the unisex bathroom, Phil pees quickly then washes his hands; he notices a few people scarpering from cubicles at the sight of him, but doesn\u2019t bother try and catch them. They\u2019re either doing drugs or having sex, and either one is moronic to do in a bathroom stall if you ask him. He does do a quick scout of the cubicles before he leaves, knocking on doors and saying stern things in the hopes of scaring them into sense for a bit. </p><p>It\u2019ll only work for a while - once they know he\u2019s out of sight they\u2019ll be back at it again, but there\u2019s not much he can do about it. They check likely suspects for pills and powders on the way in, and confiscate a fair amount, but Phil\u2019s not dumb and knows there\u2019s a hundred ways they could be hiding it. </p><p>It\u2019s as he gets to the bar again that Phil notices the swirling lights washing over a familiar waterfall of lilac, in front of the bar waiting to be served. There\u2019s a guy next to lilac hair, obnoxiously crowding them in a way that Phil is all too familiar with. The guy has a wifebeater on with the word \u2018woof\u2019 scrawled across the chest. He\u2019s also wearing a snapback indoors. Both of these are major red flags for Phil, who has seen and kicked out a lot of classic douchebags in his time. </p><p>He pauses, waiting to see the scene unfold. The bartenders are swamped with orders from the hoard of people crammed up against the bar - lilac has been pushed right to the edge with woof-man. Unless he\u2019s willing to give up his place in the makeshift queue, he won\u2019t be able to escape unwanted advances. Phil waits, certain that woof is seconds away from making his pig-headed move. He doesn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>Woof-man leans in and whispers something into the folds of the lilac wig. Whatever is said makes lilac recoil in disgust. To stop him moving away, woof-man reaches out and grabs lilac-hair by the outer hip, his meaty hand cupping the whole of his right ass-cheek, then tugs him in sharply. Already Phil is moving towards them at the sight of this, and that\u2019s when woof-man squeezes his fistful of flesh, apparently quite hard, because in the next second, lilac is calmly reaching between two people to grab a leftover beer on the bar, and promptly upending it over woof\u2019s head. The guy roars, half-drowned by the loud music, but audible enough that the near vicinity of people turn to see. Woof pulls off his snapback and shakes it out, furious; lilac flinches as the droplets of beer spray at him, but doesn\u2019t try to run away. Phil reaches them then, alarm pumping through him to the beat of a Tove Lo song, and promptly inserts himself between the two, his back to lilac, one hand on woof\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cOi, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Phil barks in his usual \u2018bouncer voice\u2019. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him not me!\u201d Woof insists, as Phil knew he would. \u201cThat little fucker chucked a beer on me!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOut of nowhere, was it?\u201d Phil\u2019s already done with this dickhead. \u201cI saw you grab \u2018em, so don\u2019t even try it. Far as I\u2019m concerned, you deserve the beer bath.\u201d </p><p>Woof\u2019s face flushes red in fury. \u201cOh, get lost, you wanker. Look at \u2018im. Boys don\u2019t dress like that to be treated like Royalty, mate. He fuckin\u2019 wants it.\u201d </p><p>A white hot, blinding rage pierces Phil right through the chest. Something primal awakens in him, picturing lilac\u2019s sweet, pretty features as he lifted the fringe from their eyes. \u201cRight,\u201d Phil growls through clenched teeth, \u201cout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Woof is practically frothing at the mouth. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bloody well can mate,\u201d Phil says; he\u2019s hoping that woof will listen to him, as he\u2019s seconds away from throwing a punch, \u201cI\u2019m the bouncer. Out. We don\u2019t want your sort in here.\u201d </p><p>The guy scoffs, squaring up, but he\u2019s wobbly, obviously tipsy, and Phil just has to take one sombre, utterly unfazed step towards him, shoulders drawn up to elevate their height difference, and the guy sinks backwards. Phil loves watching the recalculating whirr of their slowly ticking, moronic brains. </p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d the guy spits, sending a dirty look over Phil\u2019s shoulder, \u201cthis place is shite anyway.\u201d </p><p>Thankfully, he turns, stalking away, and Phil watches long enough to make sure he heads for the door. Once he\u2019s out of sight, Phil turns, somewhat unsurely, back to lilac, who is staring at Phil, the fringe parted into two curtains that split in curves across a smooth forehead. It\u2019s nice to see those eyes again; they shouldn\u2019t be hidden, Phil thinks.. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d lilac says. \u201cBut I could\u2019ve handled it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo trouble,\u201d Phil replies, chuckling at lilac\u2019s continued defiance, \u201c\u2018s what I\u2019m here for. You ok?\u201d </p><p>Lilac nods contemplatively, those brown eyes flicking over Phil\u2019s face, head tilted. He\u2019s wearing makeup, Phil notices. Something sparkly wiped across his eyelids and cheeks. Pink lipgloss. Maybe mascara too. Phil feels a curl of something he hasn\u2019t felt for a long time, twisting and writhing like a worm in his gut. He squashes it down, embarrassed by his attraction to such an obvious display of faux-feminine allure. Such a cliche, lusting after the pretty boys, or not-boys perhaps, considering what \u2018Dan\u2019 had said outside. </p><p>\u201cBet you get that problem a lot,\u201d Phil says, not thinking. He only realises how much like a come-on it sounds when it\u2019s too late. </p><p>Lilac\u2019s eyebrow quirks, and the corner of his mouth twitches up in a surprised smile. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re not flirting with me?\u201d </p><p>The blush whips into Phil\u2019s cheeks so fast it nearly unstables him. He\u2019s suddenly very aware of the intense effect this person seems to be having on him, just due to their proximity. Sure, beneath the overpowering performance of that wig lies an extraordinarily pretty human, but Phil daily encounters lots of beautiful people in this job. Gay club patrons tend to go ham on the glitz and glamour. </p><p>It\u2019s just something about lilac, in their skimpy clothes that look like they were stitched out of a teenage girl\u2019s bedroom curtains, and the cheap synthetic that somehow transforms the outfit into something bewitching. The makeup is done imperfectly, the sparkly blue varnish on their nails is \u00a0half bitten off. But there\u2019s no denying the effect lilac has, and seems to know they have, judging by the flirtatious smile being aimed his way. </p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Phil says anyway, bristling. He averts his eyes; lilac\u2019s stare is lasering right through him. \u201cI work here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d lilac replies, one bony shoulder shrugging up. Fingers come up to tuck a strand of wig behind an ear, revealing a glinting diamond stud, big and gaudy, in one lobe. \u201cAs of about ten minutes ago.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s half sure he\u2019s misheard, perhaps due to dizzying effect this person seems to be having on him, as if lilac\u2019s fingers are plucking at every thread stitching him together, unravelling him bit by bit. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve taken me on. Probationary only for now, but I\u2019ll convince them soon enough,\u201d lilac says, then finally catches the eye of Melissa, their head bartender. Lilac mouths \u2018sambucca\u2019 at her, then holds up two fingers; she nods, glancing at Phil as if to say \u2018did you really let this child in through the front door?\u2019. \u00a0\u201cI do drag,\u201d lilac says, teeth and tongue teasing out the word. \u201cOr a kind of drag, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil says, dumbed. He\u2019s not sure what a \u2018kind of\u2019 drag could mean, but there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s an intriguing thought. \u201cRight.\u201d </p><p>Under normal circumstances, Phil would find it more than suspicious that anyone in a cheap wig and very basic outfit, someone barely manage to squeeze past the bouncers in here tonight due to their youthful appearance, could have somehow secured a highly coveted spot amongst some of the best drag acts in Brighton. This club is known for its regular, popular drag performances, happening on Fridays and Saturdays. Phil hadn\u2019t even known the manager was looking for new talent - usually they hold auditions and have a long selection process, so the idea that someone would be able to walk in off the street and find work is almost unfathomable. </p><p>But these circumstances aren\u2019t normal. Lilac is not just another drag act, Phil can sense it. If they\u2019re able to hypnotise Phil, snatch him up body and soul with just a flutter of lashes and a few coy smiles, it\u2019s almost terrifying to think what lilac could do to a whole room of people. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>very</i> good,\u201d lilac says then around a knowing smile, so confident that Phil just nods in total acceptance. </p><p>Melissa pushes two shot glasses across the bar towards them, then shouts that it\u2019ll be six pounds. Lilac starts digging into some non-existent pocket in those shorts; to stop himself staring, Phil cups a hand around his mouth and shouts to Melissa, \u201cput it on my tab.\u201d</p><p>Lilac\u2019s eyes flick up to him through a haze of pastel. \u201cThanks,\u201d is the response, before they pick up the shots and down both of them one after the other. Phil blinks, chastened. Of course he wasn\u2019t certain that this jewel of a person was attempting to by him a drink, especially as they know Phil is working, but even so\u2026 it had sort of looked that way for a minute. Lilac flicks their lashes about, bored, then lands a chocolate gaze back on Phil. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you around, then.\u201d </p><p>Lilac pushes off the bar, already headed into the midst of the throng. The sight of the lilac covered back retreating is almost unbearable. Phil\u2019s arm shoots out before he can stop it, catching lilac\u2019s arm. Lilac snatches it away quickly, probably way too used to being grabbed at, and Phil feels slimy, holds his hands up in a show of surrender. Lilac has turned on the spot, is staring at him expectantly, warily. </p><p>There\u2019s no in point in asking Phil why he\u2019d felt the urge to halt this person\u2019s exit, because he has no idea. He just needed one last, proper, good look at those beautiful, beguiling features before he had to bid farewell for an indefinite amount of time. </p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d lilac asks, though because of the music, Phil can only tell what they\u2019d said by how those pink lips shaped the word. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Phil asks, for lack of anything better. Anything to prolong the inevitable parting of ways. \u201cYour drag name,\u201d Phil clarifies, hoping it\u2019s the right question.</p><p>It seems to make lilac smile, if only slightly. They shift their weight onto one foot, hip jutting out to the side. A gauze of blue passes diagonally over their face, highlighting the gleam in their eyes. </p><p>\u201cO-livia Truth,\u201d he says slowly, enunciating each syllable. \u201cI start on Friday. Blow me a kiss from the crowd.\u201d Then, with a spin on a pink stiletto, they\u2019re gone. </p>",

It\u2019s gotten warmer over the last month, so Phil no longer has to feel as guilty about the hoards of people shivering in their skimpy outfits for hours in the freezing seaside air, but it\u2019s still not fun being the guy who has to make them all wait. Strict club rules though - no more than fifteen people to be let in at once, staggered in five minute intervals. </p><p>A few people are trying to engage Phil in chatter, but he remains stoic and silent, arms folded just below the stitching on his tight black t-shirt that reads \u2018Try It Mate\u2019. The people at the front of the queue, a girl in tattered tights and a birthday sash flanked by two equally bimbo-ish friends, are finding this t-shirt hilarious, and keep yelling this at him, as if they actually think he can\u2019t hear them standing two feet away. He\u2019s had a lot of practice at ignoring drunken screeching though, so he just stares at the roiling sea in the distance, fast-forwarding his brain a few hours, to when he can relax in his bed, eat leftover pizza and play some video game he could complete blindfolded. </p><p>Billy, the other bouncer working tonight, taps Phil discreetly on the arm - the signal that enough time has passed to let some more people in. With a quiet sigh, Phil turns and unhooks the rope separating him from the drunk girls, and inclines his head to let them through. As they stumble inside the door, flashing their passports and driver\u2019s licences, Billy makes a disapproving face. Phil knows that some bouncers would label the girls as \u2018TDTD\u2019 (too drunk to dance), and not let them inside, but Phil can\u2019t be bothered to go through that whole charade with them. They look the sort that would kick off, and hold up the queue even more. They\u2019re straight, probably, out on a girls night for the sash-girl\u2019s birthday, and fancy trying out a gay club just to be daring. It pisses Phil off, and if he were more like Billy, weathered by years of the job and willing to take no nonsense, he might be more inclined to refuse them entry. </p><p>But it\u2019s too late now, they\u2019re already inside, likely ordering prosecco at a bar that serves mostly jagerbombs and cheap imitation cosmos, then clambering up on the podiums with the professional dancers and drag queens to show off for their Instagram feed. Billy nudges him in the side, and Phil realises he\u2019s still watching the entrance where the girls disappeared, and not focusing on the queue. He turns quickly to the next person - tall, skinny, dressed in a crop top that looks like it\u2019s made for a doll, a thin, satin, pink and white bomber jacket, and a pair of denim shorts so tiny that they barely begin to cover the person\u2019s ass. The highlight of the ensemble is the lilac wig that cascades in loose curls down to waist-level, complete with a thick fringe that hangs down over whoever\u2019s eyes are hiding behind it. </p><p>Phil takes one look at this joker and has half a mind to turn them away without even speaking to them, but a skinny arm reaches up to offer an ID, so Phil sighs and takes it even though every one of his spidey-senses is tingling. It\u2019s a green driver\u2019s permit, not even a full license; the date printed would make the owner twenty-one. Phil gives the lanky figure in front of him another brief once-over - no way are they a day over eighteen, and that\u2019s pushing it. His eyes flick to the name: Daniel James Howell. There\u2019s a photo too of course, of an attractive, far more masculine-presenting, clean-cut young adult with a slight side-fringe. The lilac-haired beauty in front of Phil does not, in his opinion, match this general look. Still, he supposes it\u2019s his job to make sure. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Phil asks, starting off easy so he doesn\u2019t humiliate the kid. </p><p>\u201cI guess you could call me Dan, most of the time,\u201d lilac-hair says in an unexpectedly sure, confident voice; Phil can\u2019t be sure whether the tremor he can hear is in from cold or from their nerves about being caught. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound very sure about that.\u201d </p><p>They get a lot of this kind of thing. Young, nervous gay guys - it\u2019s mostly guys - sneaking out to come for their first gay club experience, usually dressed up in their mum or sister\u2019s clothes, disguised but still scared shitless that someone will clock them and they\u2019ll be forced prematurely out of the closet. This kid is likely still in school, desperate to find a place he can be himself - unfortunately, the law is the law, and he\u2019ll just have to come back when he\u2019s old enough to have a real ID. </p><p>\u201cThink I don\u2019t know my own name?\u201d the kid asks. \u201cListen, from nine to five, my name\u2019s Dan Howell. But I\u2019m not going by Dan tonight, get me?\u201d </p><p>The irritation in this person\u2019s voice makes Phil pause. Normally, a bad attitude like this would be enough of a deterrent that they\u2019d risk getting turned away, but if anything, on lilac-hair the attitude is just confusing. What does he have to be irritated about? He\u2019s got no gaggle of friends with him, nor does he appear to be in a hurry. Phil\u2019s just trying to do his job - if this person is underage, they must\u2019ve known this might happen. </p><p>He studies the ID again, noting that for a fake it\u2019s very convincing. He turns to flash the small green card at Billy, who frowns at it, then shrugs in a \u2018looks real to me\u2019 way. Phil\u2019s gaze drifts back to lilac-hair and asks, \u201cwhat\u2019s your star sign?\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile spreads over thin, glossed pink lips. \u201cIs that the best you can come up with?\u201d </p><p>Absurdly, Phil feels himself grow warm with embarrassment. It makes no sense - he\u2019s been flirted with hundreds of times working here and it\u2019s never so much as rattled him before. He shrugs it off, trying to appear unamused. \u201cI\u2019m not flirting with you, I\u2019m trying to see if you\u2019re fucking about with me. Might wanna play along, sunshine.\u201d </p><p>The pink lips part to let out a sigh of frustration. \u201cI\u2019m a gemini. Wanna know my bra size too?\u201d</p><p>The dates on the ID work; Phil long ago learned the correct dates for the star signs for this exact reason. He ignores the snarky follow up question, which is good of him. \u201cCan you lift your wig, please?\u201d</p><p>Lilac-hair hesitates, then flicks the long locks falling by their ears back over each shoulder, revealing a lot of pale skin and sharp, jutting collarbones. Phil averts his eyes quickly - if this person is underage, he can\u2019t be staring inappropriately. Not that he should be doing that with any customers that are legal either. </p><p>\u201cNot like that,\u201d Phil says, brusquely, \u201cI can\u2019t see your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Lilac-hair lifts their head, chin jutting out, and behind the unbrushed lilac strands, Phil can almost make out two dark, almond-shaped eyes staring back at him. Phil can\u2019t help an amused smile forcing its way out, born from the kid\u2019s stubborn defiance. This person is not about to let Phil off easily, if they are lying about their age. </p><p>So, mostly to speed things along, Phil reaches out a hand - very much without thinking - and pushes the purple fringe back. The kid\u2019s eyes are round and startled, which is fair enough, as Phil hadn\u2019t even known he was going to make such a bold move until he\u2019d already done it. This is far from protocol, probably, touching the customers unless they\u2019re being belligerent and require forcible removal. But he\u2019s too far in now, holding the handful of acrylic hair out of this person\u2019s face. And yep, it\u2019s at once completely obvious that he is, in fact, the same person as the man in the ID photo - no question about it. </p><p>The ID is, apparently, real. Lilac hair is twenty-one years of age, and Phil\u2019s just got to accept it. Not a kid at all. He releases the fringe, and lilac-hair blinks as it falls back into their eyes. </p><p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d Lilac hair huffs, straightening the fringe with their fingers. </p><p>\u201cIn you go,\u201d is all Phil replies, a little gruffly because he knows he\u2019d been wrong to prematurely assume this person was trying to break the law from appearance alone. He hates that his own prejudice can sometimes leak through when assessing people in this job, though he tries his hardest to be totally impartial. He hands \u2018Dan\u2019 their ID back and lets them through the rope. Lilac-hair takes their time about going through, pulling the wig back around his shoulders, then swaying their hips as they swan by. Despite knowing he shouldn\u2019t, Phil\u2019s eyes fall to the curve of \u00a0lilac\u2019s ass, peeking through the hotpants as they head to the door. Phil never wears wigs, but he sees a lot of people in them working here, and long ago learned the difference between a cheap \u2018party city\u2019 wig, and an expensive one. The one lilac is wearing is definitely on the cheaper end of the scale, but it\u2019s gorgeous in its tackiness, like the person inside it knows that the pastel colour is exactly their shade. The plastic hair falls in a great tumble down a tapered back, bouncing just above the waistband of those tiny shorts. The sight is unforgettable, Phil can already feel it burning into his retinas, to be replayed in the dark, when he\u2019s alone. </p><p>Billy clears his throat then, breaking Phil out of his trance. He rips his eyes away, sheepishly, turning to Billy. \u201cNot a good idea to put your hands on \u2018em,\u201d Billy reminds him in his low, rough voice. \u201cSome of \u2018em get shirty about it.\u201d </p><p>Phil nods, glad of the darkness hiding his flush, and turns to the next set of people in the queue. </p><p>*</p><p>At around half one, Phil signals to Billy that he needs to take a piss. The queue is long gone by now, and they\u2019ve moved into the second half of their shift, which is watching the smoking area for people trying to do drugs, and kicking people to the kerb if they get too drunk. There haven\u2019t been too many of either instances this evening, so Phil feels pretty safe about leaving Billy alone for five minutes. He heads inside, scooting behind the bar to get across to the toilets so that he doesn\u2019t have to barge through the crowds on the dancefloor. The bartenders all nod at him as he passes, some exchanging harried looks with him because it\u2019s rammed in here, and they all spent the first few hours of the night making two of every drinks order. </p><p>In the unisex bathroom, Phil pees quickly then washes his hands; he notices a few people scarpering from cubicles at the sight of him, but doesn\u2019t bother try and catch them. They\u2019re either doing drugs or having sex, and either one is moronic to do in a bathroom stall if you ask him. He does do a quick scout of the cubicles before he leaves, knocking on doors and saying stern things in the hopes of scaring them into sense for a bit. </p><p>It\u2019ll only work for a while - once they know he\u2019s out of sight they\u2019ll be back at it again, but there\u2019s not much he can do about it. They check likely suspects for pills and powders on the way in, and confiscate a fair amount, but Phil\u2019s not dumb and knows there\u2019s a hundred ways they could be hiding it. </p><p>It\u2019s as he gets to the bar again that Phil notices the swirling lights washing over a familiar waterfall of lilac, in front of the bar waiting to be served. There\u2019s a guy next to lilac hair, obnoxiously crowding them in a way that Phil is all too familiar with. The guy has a wifebeater on with the word \u2018woof\u2019 scrawled across the chest. He\u2019s also wearing a snapback indoors. Both of these are major red flags for Phil, who has seen and kicked out a lot of classic douchebags in his time. </p><p>He pauses, waiting to see the scene unfold. The bartenders are swamped with orders from the hoard of people crammed up against the bar - lilac has been pushed right to the edge with woof-man. Unless he\u2019s willing to give up his place in the makeshift queue, he won\u2019t be able to escape unwanted advances. Phil waits, certain that woof is seconds away from making his pig-headed move. He doesn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>Woof-man leans in and whispers something into the folds of the lilac wig. Whatever is said makes lilac recoil in disgust. To stop him moving away, woof-man reaches out and grabs lilac-hair by the outer hip, his meaty hand cupping the whole of his right ass-cheek, then tugs him in sharply. Already Phil is moving towards them at the sight of this, and that\u2019s when woof-man squeezes his fistful of flesh, apparently quite hard, because in the next second, lilac is calmly reaching between two people to grab a leftover beer on the bar, and promptly upending it over woof\u2019s head. The guy roars, half-drowned by the loud music, but audible enough that the near vicinity of people turn to see. Woof pulls off his snapback and shakes it out, furious; lilac flinches as the droplets of beer spray at him, but doesn\u2019t try to run away. Phil reaches them then, alarm pumping through him to the beat of a Tove Lo song, and promptly inserts himself between the two, his back to lilac, one hand on woof\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cOi, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Phil barks in his usual \u2018bouncer voice\u2019. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him not me!\u201d Woof insists, as Phil knew he would. \u201cThat little fucker chucked a beer on me!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOut of nowhere, was it?\u201d Phil\u2019s already done with this dickhead. \u201cI saw you grab \u2018em, so don\u2019t even try it. Far as I\u2019m concerned, you deserve the beer bath.\u201d </p><p>Woof\u2019s face flushes red in fury. \u201cOh, get lost, you wanker. Look at \u2018im. Boys don\u2019t dress like that to be treated like Royalty, mate. He fuckin\u2019 wants it.\u201d </p><p>A white hot, blinding rage pierces Phil right through the chest. Something primal awakens in him, picturing lilac\u2019s sweet, pretty features as he lifted the fringe from their eyes. \u201cRight,\u201d Phil growls through clenched teeth, \u201cout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Woof is practically frothing at the mouth. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bloody well can mate,\u201d Phil says; he\u2019s hoping that woof will listen to him, as he\u2019s seconds away from throwing a punch, \u201cI\u2019m the bouncer. Out. We don\u2019t want your sort in here.\u201d </p><p>The guy scoffs, squaring up, but he\u2019s wobbly, obviously tipsy, and Phil just has to take one sombre, utterly unfazed step towards him, shoulders drawn up to elevate their height difference, and the guy sinks backwards. Phil loves watching the recalculating whirr of their slowly ticking, moronic brains. </p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d the guy spits, sending a dirty look over Phil\u2019s shoulder, \u201cthis place is shite anyway.\u201d </p><p>Thankfully, he turns, stalking away, and Phil watches long enough to make sure he heads for the door. Once he\u2019s out of sight, Phil turns, somewhat unsurely, back to lilac, who is staring at Phil, the fringe parted into two curtains that split in curves across a smooth forehead. It\u2019s nice to see those eyes again; they shouldn\u2019t be hidden, Phil thinks.. </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d lilac says. \u201cBut I could\u2019ve handled it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo trouble,\u201d Phil replies, chuckling at lilac\u2019s continued defiance, \u201c\u2018s what I\u2019m here for. You ok?\u201d </p><p>Lilac nods contemplatively, those brown eyes flicking over Phil\u2019s face, head tilted. He\u2019s wearing makeup, Phil notices. Something sparkly wiped across his eyelids and cheeks. Pink lipgloss. Maybe mascara too. Phil feels a curl of something he hasn\u2019t felt for a long time, twisting and writhing like a worm in his gut. He squashes it down, embarrassed by his attraction to such an obvious display of faux-feminine allure. Such a cliche, lusting after the pretty boys, or not-boys perhaps, considering what \u2018Dan\u2019 had said outside. </p><p>\u201cBet you get that problem a lot,\u201d Phil says, not thinking. He only realises how much like a come-on it sounds when it\u2019s too late. </p><p>Lilac\u2019s eyebrow quirks, and the corner of his mouth twitches up in a surprised smile. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re not flirting with me?\u201d </p><p>The blush whips into Phil\u2019s cheeks so fast it nearly unstables him. He\u2019s suddenly very aware of the intense effect this person seems to be having on him, just due to their proximity. Sure, beneath the overpowering performance of that wig lies an extraordinarily pretty human, but Phil daily encounters lots of beautiful people in this job. Gay club patrons tend to go ham on the glitz and glamour. </p><p>It\u2019s just something about lilac, in their skimpy clothes that look like they were stitched out of a teenage girl\u2019s bedroom curtains, and the cheap synthetic that somehow transforms the outfit into something bewitching. The makeup is done imperfectly, the sparkly blue varnish on their nails is \u00a0half bitten off. But there\u2019s no denying the effect lilac has, and seems to know they have, judging by the flirtatious smile being aimed his way. </p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Phil says anyway, bristling. He averts his eyes; lilac\u2019s stare is lasering right through him. \u201cI work here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d lilac replies, one bony shoulder shrugging up. Fingers come up to tuck a strand of wig behind an ear, revealing a glinting diamond stud, big and gaudy, in one lobe. \u201cAs of about ten minutes ago.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s half sure he\u2019s misheard, perhaps due to dizzying effect this person seems to be having on him, as if lilac\u2019s fingers are plucking at every thread stitching him together, unravelling him bit by bit. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve taken me on. Probationary only for now, but I\u2019ll convince them soon enough,\u201d lilac says, then finally catches the eye of Melissa, their head bartender. Lilac mouths \u2018sambucca\u2019 at her, then holds up two fingers; she nods, glancing at Phil as if to say \u2018did you really let this child in through the front door?\u2019. \u00a0\u201cI do drag,\u201d lilac says, teeth and tongue teasing out the word. \u201cOr a kind of drag, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil says, dumbed. He\u2019s not sure what a \u2018kind of\u2019 drag could mean, but there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s an intriguing thought. \u201cRight.\u201d </p><p>Under normal circumstances, Phil would find it more than suspicious that anyone in a cheap wig and very basic outfit, someone barely manage to squeeze past the bouncers in here tonight due to their youthful appearance, could have somehow secured a highly coveted spot amongst some of the best drag acts in Brighton. This club is known for its regular, popular drag performances, happening on Fridays and Saturdays. Phil hadn\u2019t even known the manager was looking for new talent - usually they hold auditions and have a long selection process, so the idea that someone would be able to walk in off the street and find work is almost unfathomable. </p><p>But these circumstances aren\u2019t normal. Lilac is not just another drag act, Phil can sense it. If they\u2019re able to hypnotise Phil, snatch him up body and soul with just a flutter of lashes and a few coy smiles, it\u2019s almost terrifying to think what lilac could do to a whole room of people. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>very</i> good,\u201d lilac says then around a knowing smile, so confident that Phil just nods in total acceptance. </p><p>Melissa pushes two shot glasses across the bar towards them, then shouts that it\u2019ll be six pounds. Lilac starts digging into some non-existent pocket in those shorts; to stop himself staring, Phil cups a hand around his mouth and shouts to Melissa, \u201cput it on my tab.\u201d</p><p>Lilac\u2019s eyes flick up to him through a haze of pastel. \u201cThanks,\u201d is the response, before they pick up the shots and down both of them one after the other. Phil blinks, chastened. Of course he wasn\u2019t certain that this jewel of a person was attempting to by him a drink, especially as they know Phil is working, but even so\u2026 it had sort of looked that way for a minute. Lilac flicks their lashes about, bored, then lands a chocolate gaze back on Phil. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you around, then.\u201d </p><p>Lilac pushes off the bar, already headed into the midst of the throng. The sight of the lilac covered back retreating is almost unbearable. Phil\u2019s arm shoots out before he can stop it, catching lilac\u2019s arm. Lilac snatches it away quickly, probably way too used to being grabbed at, and Phil feels slimy, holds his hands up in a show of surrender. Lilac has turned on the spot, is staring at him expectantly, warily. </p><p>There\u2019s no in point in asking Phil why he\u2019d felt the urge to halt this person\u2019s exit, because he has no idea. He just needed one last, proper, good look at those beautiful, beguiling features before he had to bid farewell for an indefinite amount of time. </p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d lilac asks, though because of the music, Phil can only tell what they\u2019d said by how those pink lips shaped the word. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Phil asks, for lack of anything better. Anything to prolong the inevitable parting of ways. \u201cYour drag name,\u201d Phil clarifies, hoping it\u2019s the right question.</p><p>It seems to make lilac smile, if only slightly. They shift their weight onto one foot, hip jutting out to the side. A gauze of blue passes diagonally over their face, highlighting the gleam in their eyes. </p><p>\u201cO-livia Truth,\u201d he says slowly, enunciating each syllable. \u201cI start on Friday. Blow me a kiss from the crowd.\u201d Then, with a spin on a pink stiletto, they\u2019re gone. </p>",
                "content": "<p><b>hey anyone that wanted me to write the bodyguard au inspired by <a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184278678720/getting-major-bodyguardbouncer-vibes-from\">this picture of phil</a>, here&rsquo;s what i got for u xoxo</b></p><p>On Thursdays, their busiest nights, the club offers two for one drinks for anyone who gets there before twelve, meaning the line outside the door often snakes all the way down to the pier. It&rsquo;s gotten warmer over the last month, so Phil no longer has to feel as guilty about the hoards of people shivering in their skimpy outfits for hours in the freezing seaside air, but it&rsquo;s still not fun being the guy who has to make them all wait. Strict club rules though - no more than fifteen people to be let in at once, staggered in five minute intervals. </p><p>A few people are trying to engage Phil in chatter, but he remains stoic and silent, arms folded just below the stitching on his tight black t-shirt that reads &lsquo;Try It Mate&rsquo;. The people at the front of the queue, a girl in tattered tights and a birthday sash flanked by two equally bimbo-ish friends, are finding this t-shirt hilarious, and keep yelling this at him, as if they actually think he can&rsquo;t hear them standing two feet away. He&rsquo;s had a lot of practice at ignoring drunken screeching though, so he just stares at the roiling sea in the distance, fast-forwarding his brain a few hours, to when he can relax in his bed, eat leftover pizza and play some video game he could complete blindfolded. </p><p>Billy, the other bouncer working tonight, taps Phil discreetly on the arm - the signal that enough time has passed to let some more people in. With a quiet sigh, Phil turns and unhooks the rope separating him from the drunk girls, and inclines his head to let them through. As they stumble inside the door, flashing their passports and driver&rsquo;s licences, Billy makes a disapproving face. Phil knows that some bouncers would label the girls as &lsquo;TDTD&rsquo; (too drunk to dance), and not let them inside, but Phil can&rsquo;t be bothered to go through that whole charade with them. They look the sort that would kick off, and hold up the queue even more. They&rsquo;re straight, probably, out on a girls night for the sash-girl&rsquo;s birthday, and fancy trying out a gay club just to be daring. It pisses Phil off, and if he were more like Billy, weathered by years of the job and willing to take no nonsense, he might be more inclined to refuse them entry. </p><p>But it&rsquo;s too late now, they&rsquo;re already inside, likely ordering prosecco at a bar that serves mostly jagerbombs and cheap imitation cosmos, then clambering up on the podiums with the professional dancers and drag queens to show off for their Instagram feed. Billy nudges him in the side, and Phil realises he&rsquo;s still watching the entrance where the girls disappeared, and not focusing on the queue. He turns quickly to the next person - tall, skinny, dressed in a crop top that looks like it&rsquo;s made for a doll, a thin, satin, pink and white bomber jacket, and a pair of denim shorts so tiny that they barely begin to cover the person&rsquo;s ass. The highlight of the ensemble is the lilac wig that cascades in loose curls down to waist-level, complete with a thick fringe that hangs down over whoever&rsquo;s eyes are hiding behind it. </p><p>Phil takes one look at this joker and has half a mind to turn them away without even speaking to them, but a skinny arm reaches up to offer an ID, so Phil sighs and takes it even though every one of his spidey-senses is tingling. It&rsquo;s a green driver&rsquo;s permit, not even a full license; the date printed would make the owner twenty-one. Phil gives the lanky figure in front of him another brief once-over - no way are they a day over eighteen, and that&rsquo;s pushing it. His eyes flick to the name: Daniel James Howell. There&rsquo;s a photo too of course, of an attractive, far more masculine-presenting, clean-cut young adult with a slight side-fringe. The lilac-haired beauty in front of Phil does not, in his opinion, match this general look. Still, he supposes it&rsquo;s his job to make sure. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Phil asks, starting off easy so he doesn&rsquo;t humiliate the kid. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess you could call me Dan, most of the time,&rdquo; lilac-hair says in an unexpectedly sure, confident voice; Phil can&rsquo;t be sure whether the tremor he can hear is in from cold or from their nerves about being caught. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sound very sure about that.&rdquo; </p><p>They get a lot of this kind of thing. Young, nervous gay guys - it&rsquo;s mostly guys - sneaking out to come for their first gay club experience, usually dressed up in their mum or sister&rsquo;s clothes, disguised but still scared shitless that someone will clock them and they&rsquo;ll be forced prematurely out of the closet. This kid is likely still in school, desperate to find a place he can be himself - unfortunately, the law is the law, and he&rsquo;ll just have to come back when he&rsquo;s old enough to have a real ID. </p><p>&ldquo;Think I don&rsquo;t know my own name?&rdquo; the kid asks. &ldquo;Listen, from nine to five, my name&rsquo;s Dan Howell. But I&rsquo;m not going by Dan tonight, get me?&rdquo; </p><p>The irritation in this person&rsquo;s voice makes Phil pause. Normally, a bad attitude like this would be enough of a deterrent that they&rsquo;d risk getting turned away, but if anything, on lilac-hair the attitude is just confusing. What does he have to be irritated about? He&rsquo;s got no gaggle of friends with him, nor does he appear to be in a hurry. Phil&rsquo;s just trying to do his job - if this person is underage, they must&rsquo;ve known this might happen. </p><p>He studies the ID again, noting that for a fake it&rsquo;s very convincing. He turns to flash the small green card at Billy, who frowns at it, then shrugs in a &lsquo;looks real to me&rsquo; way. Phil&rsquo;s gaze drifts back to lilac-hair and asks, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your star sign?&rdquo;</p><p>A tiny smile spreads over thin, glossed pink lips. &ldquo;Is that the best you can come up with?&rdquo; </p><p>Absurdly, Phil feels himself grow warm with embarrassment. It makes no sense - he&rsquo;s been flirted with hundreds of times working here and it&rsquo;s never so much as rattled him before. He shrugs it off, trying to appear unamused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not flirting with you, I&rsquo;m trying to see if you&rsquo;re fucking about with me. Might wanna play along, sunshine.&rdquo; </p><p>The pink lips part to let out a sigh of frustration. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a gemini. Wanna know my bra size too?&rdquo;</p><p>The dates on the ID work; Phil long ago learned the correct dates for the star signs for this exact reason. He ignores the snarky follow up question, which is good of him. &ldquo;Can you lift your wig, please?&rdquo;</p><p>Lilac-hair hesitates, then flicks the long locks falling by their ears back over each shoulder, revealing a lot of pale skin and sharp, jutting collarbones. Phil averts his eyes quickly - if this person is underage, he can&rsquo;t be staring inappropriately. Not that he should be doing that with any customers that are legal either. </p><p>&ldquo;Not like that,&rdquo; Phil says, brusquely, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see your eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>Lilac-hair lifts their head, chin jutting out, and behind the unbrushed lilac strands, Phil can almost make out two dark, almond-shaped eyes staring back at him. Phil can&rsquo;t help an amused smile forcing its way out, born from the kid&rsquo;s stubborn defiance. This person is not about to let Phil off easily, if they are lying about their age. </p><p>So, mostly to speed things along, Phil reaches out a hand - very much without thinking - and pushes the purple fringe back. The kid&rsquo;s eyes are round and startled, which is fair enough, as Phil hadn&rsquo;t even known he was going to make such a bold move until he&rsquo;d already done it. This is far from protocol, probably, touching the customers unless they&rsquo;re being belligerent and require forcible removal. But he&rsquo;s too far in now, holding the handful of acrylic hair out of this person&rsquo;s face. And yep, it&rsquo;s at once completely obvious that he is, in fact, the same person as the man in the ID photo - no question about it. </p><p>The ID is, apparently, real. Lilac hair is twenty-one years of age, and Phil&rsquo;s just got to accept it. Not a kid at all. He releases the fringe, and lilac-hair blinks as it falls back into their eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Satisfied?&rdquo; Lilac hair huffs, straightening the fringe with their fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;In you go,&rdquo; is all Phil replies, a little gruffly because he knows he&rsquo;d been wrong to prematurely assume this person was trying to break the law from appearance alone. He hates that his own prejudice can sometimes leak through when assessing people in this job, though he tries his hardest to be totally impartial. He hands &lsquo;Dan&rsquo; their ID back and lets them through the rope. Lilac-hair takes their time about going through, pulling the wig back around his shoulders, then swaying their hips as they swan by. Despite knowing he shouldn&rsquo;t, Phil&rsquo;s eyes fall to the curve of &nbsp;lilac&rsquo;s ass, peeking through the hotpants as they head to the door. Phil never wears wigs, but he sees a lot of people in them working here, and long ago learned the difference between a cheap &lsquo;party city&rsquo; wig, and an expensive one.

There haven&rsquo;t been too many of either instances this evening, so Phil feels pretty safe about leaving Billy alone for five minutes.

Both of these are major red flags for Phil, who has seen and kicked out a lot of classic douchebags in his time. </p><p>He pauses, waiting to see the scene unfold. The bartenders are swamped with orders from the hoard of people crammed up against the bar - lilac has been pushed right to the edge with woof-man. Unless he&rsquo;s willing to give up his place in the makeshift queue, he won&rsquo;t be able to escape unwanted advances. Phil waits, certain that woof is seconds away from making his pig-headed move. He doesn&rsquo;t have to wait long.</p><p>Woof-man leans in and whispers something into the folds of the lilac wig. Whatever is said makes lilac recoil in disgust. To stop him moving away, woof-man reaches out and grabs lilac-hair by the outer hip, his meaty hand cupping the whole of his right ass-cheek, then tugs him in sharply. Already Phil is moving towards them at the sight of this, and that&rsquo;s when woof-man squeezes his fistful of flesh, apparently quite hard, because in the next second, lilac is calmly reaching between two people to grab a leftover beer on the bar, and promptly upending it over woof&rsquo;s head. The guy roars, half-drowned by the loud music, but audible enough that the near vicinity of people turn to see. Woof pulls off his snapback and shakes it out, furious; lilac flinches as the droplets of beer spray at him, but doesn&rsquo;t try to run away. Phil reaches them then, alarm pumping through him to the beat of a Tove Lo song, and promptly inserts himself between the two, his back to lilac, one hand on woof&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Oi, that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Phil barks in his usual &lsquo;bouncer voice&rsquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him not me!&rdquo; Woof insists, as Phil knew he would. &ldquo;That little fucker chucked a beer on me!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Out of nowhere, was it?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s already done with this dickhead. &ldquo;I saw you grab &lsquo;em, so don&rsquo;t even try it. Far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you deserve the beer bath.&rdquo; </p><p>Woof&rsquo;s face flushes red in fury. &ldquo;Oh, get lost, you wanker. Look at &lsquo;im. Boys don&rsquo;t dress like that to be treated like Royalty, mate. He fuckin&rsquo; wants it.&rdquo; </p><p>A white hot, blinding rage pierces Phil right through the chest. Something primal awakens in him, picturing lilac&rsquo;s sweet, pretty features as he lifted the fringe from their eyes. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Phil growls through clenched teeth, &ldquo;out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Woof is practically frothing at the mouth. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bloody well can mate,&rdquo; Phil says; he&rsquo;s hoping that woof will listen to him, as he&rsquo;s seconds away from throwing a punch, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the bouncer. Out. We don&rsquo;t want your sort in here.&rdquo; </p><p>The guy scoffs, squaring up, but he&rsquo;s wobbly, obviously tipsy, and Phil just has to take one sombre, utterly unfazed step towards him, shoulders drawn up to elevate their height difference, and the guy sinks backwards. Phil loves watching the recalculating whirr of their slowly ticking, moronic brains. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; the guy spits, sending a dirty look over Phil&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;this place is shite anyway.&rdquo; </p><p>Thankfully, he turns, stalking away, and Phil watches long enough to make sure he heads for the door. Once he&rsquo;s out of sight, Phil turns, somewhat unsurely, back to lilac, who is staring at Phil, the fringe parted into two curtains that split in curves across a smooth forehead. It&rsquo;s nice to see those eyes again; they shouldn&rsquo;t be hidden, Phil thinks.. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; lilac says. &ldquo;But I could&rsquo;ve handled it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No trouble,&rdquo; Phil replies, chuckling at lilac&rsquo;s continued defiance, &ldquo;&lsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for. You ok?&rdquo; </p><p>Lilac nods contemplatively, those brown eyes flicking over Phil&rsquo;s face, head tilted. He&rsquo;s wearing makeup, Phil notices. Something sparkly wiped across his eyelids and cheeks. Pink lipgloss. Maybe mascara too. Phil feels a curl of something he hasn&rsquo;t felt for a long time, twisting and writhing like a worm in his gut. He squashes it down, embarrassed by his attraction to such an obvious display of faux-feminine allure. Such a cliche, lusting after the pretty boys, or not-boys perhaps, considering what &lsquo;Dan&rsquo; had said outside. </p><p>&ldquo;Bet you get that problem a lot,&rdquo; Phil says, not thinking. He only realises how much like a come-on it sounds when it&rsquo;s too late. </p><p>Lilac&rsquo;s eyebrow quirks, and the corner of his mouth twitches up in a surprised smile. &ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re not flirting with me?&rdquo; </p><p>The blush whips into Phil&rsquo;s cheeks so fast it nearly unstables him. He&rsquo;s suddenly very aware of the intense effect this person seems to be having on him, just due to their proximity. Sure, beneath the overpowering performance of that wig lies an extraordinarily pretty human, but Phil daily encounters lots of beautiful people in this job. Gay club patrons tend to go ham on the glitz and glamour. </p><p>It&rsquo;s just something about lilac, in their skimpy clothes that look like they were stitched out of a teenage girl&rsquo;s bedroom curtains, and the cheap synthetic that somehow transforms the outfit into something bewitching. The makeup is done imperfectly, the sparkly blue varnish on their nails is &nbsp;half bitten off. But there&rsquo;s no denying the effect lilac has, and seems to know they have, judging by the flirtatious smile being aimed his way. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Phil says anyway, bristling. He averts his eyes; lilac&rsquo;s stare is lasering right through him. &ldquo;I work here.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; lilac replies, one bony shoulder shrugging up. Fingers come up to tuck a strand of wig behind an ear, revealing a glinting diamond stud, big and gaudy, in one lobe. &ldquo;As of about ten minutes ago.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s half sure he&rsquo;s misheard, perhaps due to dizzying effect this person seems to be having on him, as if lilac&rsquo;s fingers are plucking at every thread stitching him together, unravelling him bit by bit. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve taken me on. Probationary only for now, but I&rsquo;ll convince them soon enough,&rdquo; lilac says, then finally catches the eye of Melissa, their head bartender. Lilac mouths &lsquo;sambucca&rsquo; at her, then holds up two fingers; she nods, glancing at Phil as if to say &lsquo;did you really let this child in through the front door?&rsquo;. &nbsp;&ldquo;I do drag,&rdquo; lilac says, teeth and tongue teasing out the word. &ldquo;Or a kind of drag, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Phil says, dumbed. He&rsquo;s not sure what a &lsquo;kind of&rsquo; drag could mean, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that it&rsquo;s an intriguing thought. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo; </p><p>Under normal circumstances, Phil would find it more than suspicious that anyone in a cheap wig and very basic outfit, someone barely manage to squeeze past the bouncers in here tonight due to their youthful appearance, could have somehow secured a highly coveted spot amongst some of the best drag acts in Brighton. This club is known for its regular, popular drag performances, happening on Fridays and Saturdays. Phil hadn&rsquo;t even known the manager was looking for new talent - usually they hold auditions and have a long selection process, so the idea that someone would be able to walk in off the street and find work is almost unfathomable. </p><p>But these circumstances aren&rsquo;t normal. Lilac is not just another drag act, Phil can sense it. If they&rsquo;re able to hypnotise Phil, snatch him up body and soul with just a flutter of lashes and a few coy smiles, it&rsquo;s almost terrifying to think what lilac could do to a whole room of people. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>very</i> good,&rdquo; lilac says then around a knowing smile, so confident that Phil just nods in total acceptance. </p><p>Melissa pushes two shot glasses across the bar towards them, then shouts that it&rsquo;ll be six pounds. Lilac starts digging into some non-existent pocket in those shorts; to stop himself staring, Phil cups a hand around his mouth and shouts to Melissa, &ldquo;put it on my tab.&rdquo;</p><p>Lilac&rsquo;s eyes flick up to him through a haze of pastel. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; is the response, before they pick up the shots and down both of them one after the other. Phil blinks, chastened. Of course he wasn&rsquo;t certain that this jewel of a person was attempting to by him a drink, especially as they know Phil is working, but even so&hellip; it had sort of looked that way for a minute. Lilac flicks their lashes about, bored, then lands a chocolate gaze back on Phil. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll see you around, then.&rdquo; </p><p>Lilac pushes off the bar, already headed into the midst of the throng. The sight of the lilac covered back retreating is almost unbearable. Phil&rsquo;s arm shoots out before he can stop it, catching lilac&rsquo;s arm. Lilac snatches it away quickly, probably way too used to being grabbed at, and Phil feels slimy, holds his hands up in a show of surrender. Lilac has turned on the spot, is staring at him expectantly, warily. </p><p>There&rsquo;s no in point in asking Phil why he&rsquo;d felt the urge to halt this person&rsquo;s exit, because he has no idea. He just needed one last, proper, good look at those beautiful, beguiling features before he had to bid farewell for an indefinite amount of time. </p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; lilac asks, though because of the music, Phil can only tell what they&rsquo;d said by how those pink lips shaped the word. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Phil asks, for lack of anything better. Anything to prolong the inevitable parting of ways. &ldquo;Your drag name,&rdquo; Phil clarifies, hoping it&rsquo;s the right question.</p><p>It seems to make lilac smile, if only slightly. They shift their weight onto one foot, hip jutting out to the side. A gauze of blue passes diagonally over their face, highlighting the gleam in their eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;O-livia Truth,&rdquo; he says slowly, enunciating each syllable. &ldquo;I start on Friday. Blow me a kiss from the crowd.&rdquo; Then, with a spin on a pink stiletto, they&rsquo;re gone. </p>",
