Arya is the bully. She got pampered and get away with everything. Even, when she breaking the rules, she is not the who have to pay the price. Lady is murdered to pay for her and Nymeria actions. Yet, Arya is the one who got consoled by her father. While, Sansa was abandoned, grieving alone. As if Nymeria is not alive and free.",
        "answer": "<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more. This is why I&rsquo;m baffled how so many people accuse Sansa of being spoiled. All the kids are sheltered and privileged in books and show, but in the show it&rsquo;s exactly as you say. Arya somehow got away with humiliating Sansa in front of their own court and the Royal Family and got no worse punishment than sent to her room- not something she would probably protest very loudly. Her brothers, Theon, even Jeyne Poole (who hates Arya in the books) laugh at this mischievous scamp, putting salt on the wound. What&rsquo;s Sansa being spoiled with and how is Arya the outcast here? </p><p>It&rsquo;s also Sansa who gets punished for other people&rsquo;s actions- Sansa loses her wolf and earns Joffrey&rsquo;s ire for Nymeria and Arya attacking him, she gets beaten for Robb winning battles, Arya even blames her for drawing Mordane&rsquo;s attention when she&rsquo;s the one being loud. </p>",

His emotional senses are very dulled now and his sense of propriety has gone down too (like how he dismissed Meera the way he did), yet he still had enough to let Sansa know he understands she went through hell and empathized with her plight.",

Did Sansa express a need to hear someone tell her they empathised with her because of that? If they had written that scene it would have at least shown Bran trying to reach out through the wall of incalculable knowledge he has acquired. At least because of that scene no one can accuse Sansa of stealing his inheritance or anything and despite the show barely featuring Bran I did like the other scenes that they shared.
