The tour was over and Anna was about to fly back to London, back to her\nnormal life, as if the last few weeks hadn\u2019t changed everything. Nothing could\nbe the same now, not for her or her blog. It was strange to think that it was\nonly a few months ago that she was sitting at her desk, with her head in her\nhands trying her best to get her essay written, only to decide to drop out a\nfew hours later. That seemed like a lifetime ago, Ronnie was speaking to her\nback then, her blog was simply a hobby and Harry was Harry Styles the popstar,\nnot Harry Styles her boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cHow do you do it H?\u201d\nAnna asked Harry in the back of the car on the way to LAX. </p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he said</p><p>\u201cGo back to your\nnormal life after all this?\u201d </p><p>He turned his head\nand looked out the window at the passing trees that lined the streets. </p><p>\u201cThis is my normal\u201d\nhe sighed \u201cFor the better part of the last 8 years I\u2019ve been on the road, all\nof this is normal to me, my life is here in LA just as much as it is in London,\nI almost hate that I\u2019m leaving so soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kinda what I\nmean, how do you go back to London and just live after all this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird at first,\nbut I\u2019ll have you to keep me busy, plus I have an album to write so instead of\nplaying these songs to thousands everyday, I\u2019ll be in the studio writing new\nones\u201d </p><p>\u201cObviously all about\nme\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cHow could they not\nbe\u201d he smiled, wrapping his arm around her and bringing her into his chest\n\u201cyou\u2019re incredible An, changed my life\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s heart\nfluttered, she wanted nothing more than to say those three little words, but\nshe wasn\u2019t sure that he was ready to hear it. </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the one\nwhose life has been changed\u201d she opted out, this wasn\u2019t the time, she wasn\u2019t\nsure there would ever be a perfect time to say it, but this was an ending, and\nthose words were meant for a beginning. </p><p>He kissed her on the\nforehead \u201cBoth of us\u201d </p><p>In the background of\ntheir conversation the car pulled up and the driver switched it off. </p><p>\u201cLAX\u201d he said\nbringing them back to reality. </p><p>Anna looked out the\nwindow at the hundreds of people going about their day, going on holiday, or on\nbusiness trips, going home or going away and she gulped at how many of them\nwould know who Harry is. She was still hesitant about being seen with him,\nespecially in public places like airports, it wasn\u2019t that she was embarrassed\nor anything, it was just that she hated people staring at her and she hated even\nmore the articles that would no doubt be out by the time they arrive in London.\n<i>\u201cAnna Elliot uses Harry Styles to get more followers\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cYou know what this\nreminds me of?\u201d Harry said, pulling Anna back into the conversation</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOur first date\u201d he\nsmiled \u201cbut this time we\u2019re both getting out of the car\u201d </p><p>And so they did.\nHarry jumped out first and loaded their bags onto a trolley and took Anna\u2019s\nhand in his. </p><p>Airports made Anna\nnervous, this was only the second time she\u2019d ever been on an international\nflight, the first on the way over here, but there were some perks to being\nHarry Styles and one of them was skipping the queues. They went straight\nthrough security, and onto the first class lounge, where they were brought two\nglasses of champagne and some fresh fruit to munch on while they waited to\nboard. </p><p>\u201cThank you Harry\u201d\nAnna said when there was a lul in the conversation. </p><p>\u201cWhat for love?\u201d he\nasked curiously </p><p>\u201cInviting me on tour\nwith you, I know I\u2019ve told you that I\u2019m glad I came, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve\nthanked you for everything\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to\nthank me An, I should be thanking you, for dropping everything for a month and\na half to spend some more time with me\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be\nweird not waking up next to you everyday\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can have\nsleepovers\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cFlight 237 to London\nis now boarding\u201d a voice came over the loudspeaker alerting them to their\nimpending flight. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us\u201d Harry\nsaid, standing up and picking up their bags. \u201cYou going to finish that?\u201d he\npointed to Anna\u2019s almost full glass of champagne</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she shook her\nhead \u201cstill feeling a bit funny\u201d Those stomach aches had only gotten worse over\nthe last few weeks of the tour, to the point where they no longer went away,\nthey weren\u2019t always crippling, but they were there, lingering, reminding Anna\nsomething wasn\u2019t right. She\u2019d promised Harry that as soon as they got home\nshe\u2019d make an appointment with her G.P, just to make sure everything was ok. </p><p>He gave her a\nconcerned look, but still reached down and grabbed the glass, downing the whole\nthing in one go and shrugging when he put it down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a nervous\nflyer\u201d he admitted \u201cand if you don\u2019t make that appointment the minute we get\nhome, I\u2019ll be doing it for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised I\u2019d do it\nStyles\u201d she smiled and started walking towards their gate. </p><p>The flight wasn\u2019t\npacked by any stretch of the imagination, in fact, Anna and Harry were the only\none\u2019s in first class and Anna was glad to have their privacy. Home was so close\nand it wasn\u2019t until now that Anna realised how much she\u2019d missed it. </p><p>The seatbelt light\nflashed red and the flight attendant gave the safety demonstration to which\nboth Anna and Harry paid very close attention and once it was over and the\nplane was happily soaring through the sky, Anna took out her laptop and started\ntyping. Her holiday was over now but that wasn\u2019t official until there was a\nblog post about it. </p><p><b><i>The End of an Era</i></b></p><p><i>Ok, I admit the title\nof this post sounds a little dramatic but hear me out. On April 7th 2017, Harry\nreleased his first solo single which now holds a lot of meaning for a lot of\npeople, myself included and yesterday, on July 14th 2018, he performed the\nfinal show of the world tour for that album. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Now, for those of you\nthat have been around so nice before H and I started dating you\u2019ll know that I\nwas fan, and I, like many of you, remember listening to \u201cSign of the Times\u201d for\nthe first time and thinking that this song was going to make a difference to my\nlife in some small way. </i></p><p><i>Flash forward to a\nyear later and I was at Harry\u2019s London show and that song that should have only\nmade a small difference to my life had suddenly made a huge difference. </i></p><p><i>These last few months\nhave been a whirlwind but I wouldn\u2019t change any of it for the world. I\u2019m\nwriting this post as I sit on the plane on my way back to London and I\u2019m filled\nwith all sorts of feelings about it all being over. On the one hand, I\u2019m happy\nto be going home and seeing my friends and family again but on the other, I\u2019ve\nhad the time of my life on tour and I\u2019ll be missing everyone that I\u2019ve met\nalong the way. No matter what happens with Harry and I, I will forever be\ngrateful for all of the fun that I\u2019ve had on this tour for all of the memories\nI\u2019ve made and all of the chances I\u2019ve had to meet you guys. Every night at\nevery show I watched thousands of people sing along to Harry\u2019s lyrics and some\nnights, some people would see me singing along and come and join me and those\nare some of the happiest memories that I have. </i></p><p><i>Harry and I would arrive\nat each venue around 5pm every night, and when we got there, all 83 members of\nthe crew would have everything all set up and ready for soundcheck. I know\nHarry thanked them every night, but their work was truly tireless and I\u2019m\npretty sure most of them only slept a few hours a night, so I thought I\u2019d take\nthis opportunity to thank them as well, because without them the tour wouldn\u2019t\nhave happened and I wouldn\u2019t have had all the fun that I did. </i></p><p><i>Before I go, I have a\nstory to tell, for Clare Uchima, who told me to write about Ping Pong, back\nbefore you all knew about me and Harry and I decided not to incase you put it\nall together, which I\u2019m sure many of you did anyway. \u00a0I have never been\none known for her sporting abilities, but backstage on this tour, there was a\nping pong tournament. Now, Harry ended up winning and you can decide for\nyourselves whether it was rigged or not, but that\u2019s not the point of this\nstory. The tournament was organised by yours truly and it gave me the chance to\nget to know everyone on the crew. It all came to an end at Madison Square\nGarden, and everyone gathered around to watch the final match and that\u2019s how\nI\u2019d characterise the tour, supportive, friendly and above all kind. Treat\nPeople with Kindness was more than a slogan on a t-shirt, it was everything\nthat mattered on the Harry Styles world tour and it\u2019s a big part of why Harry\nand I are an item. </i></p><p><i>As for an update on\nmy plans for this blog now that I\u2019ll be home, I\u2019ll go back to posting daily\nagain, and there\u2019s lots of new content to come your way too.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m off to have a\nnanna nap now, thanks for sticking by me through this wonderful journey, I\ncan\u2019t wait for our next adventures. </i></p><p><i>Anna. x </i></p><p>Anna\u2019s Mum had\npromised to meet them at the airport and she was excited, but Harry was\nnervous. This would be their first meeting, and it would be at heathrow\nairport. He knew they wouldn\u2019t be there long and that most of their\nconversation would happen in the car and back at Anna\u2019s flat but that initial\nintroduction would in front of onlookers, something he should be comfortable\nwith by now and if this didn\u2019t mean so much to him, it would be different, but\nhe needed to make a good impression. </p><p>\u201cYou alright H?\u201d Anna\nasked, watching Harry fidget in his seat just before they were about to land. </p><p>\u201cI just realised that\nI\u2019m meeting your mum as soon as we get off this plane\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely\nwoman\u201d Anna yawned </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that\u201d\nhe smiled \u201cshe raised you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat she did\u201d Anna\nrested her head on his shoulder \u201cso her name is Debbie, but let her introduce\nherself first, she hates when people know her name without her telling them\nfirst\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat seems fair\u201d he\nsaid, running his fingers through her hair </p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t be too intense\nwith the eye contact, she hates that\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike mother, like\ndaughter\u201d he sighed \u201canything else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really, we\u2019re\nessentially the same person, so if you won me over you\u2019ll be able to win her\nover pretty easily\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kiss her\nthough\u201d he giggled. The plane was landing and they were trying to keep\nthemselves distracted but as the wheels hit the runway, less than smoothly,\nthey both flinched. </p><p>\u201cI hate planes\u201d Harry\nsighed </p><p>\u201cYou really should\nconsider a less international career then\u201d she laughed. </p><p>Now that the plane\nwas safely on the ground, Harry was feeling more nervous than ever. He may be\nable to get on stage in front of thousands of people every night with ease, but\nmeeting Anna\u2019s mother was absolutely terrifying. Especially when he was tired and\ndry from the flight. </p><p>Being in first class\nthey were the first to leave the plane and once again, because he was Harry\nStyles and he spent a lot of time at heathrow airport, they were fast tracked\nstraight to customs and onto baggage claim. Their bags rolled in and both\npicked them up. </p><p>\u201cNo no no\u201d Harry\nsaid, taking Anna\u2019s bag from her \u201cCan\u2019t have your mum thinking I\u2019m not a\ngentleman\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make her\nthink you\u2019re a mad man if you\u2019re trying to wheel two suitcases behind you, it\u2019s\non wheels, I\u2019ll manage\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine\u201d he sighed \u201cYou\nfeeling alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling like I\nwant to go home\u201d she snapped playfully \u201cand please don\u2019t say anything to mum\nabout me not being well this whole time, it\u2019ll will just worry her\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worries me\u201d he\nadmitted, putting his arm over her shoulder \u201ccome on Elliot, let\u2019s get you\nhome\u201d </p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s at the\narrivals gate\u201d she rested her head against his shoulder as they walked and\nignored everyone that stared at them along the way. It was reasonably quiet for\nan airport this big and they didn\u2019t have to weave their way through hundreds of\npeople to get to Anna\u2019s mum. </p><p>As soon as Debbie was\nin sight, Anna pulled away from Harry and left her bag with him \u00a0so that\nshe could hug her mum. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long my\nlove, I\u2019ve missed you\u201d Debbie said into Anna\u2019s shoulder without breaking the\nhug \u201cHow was it? What\u2019s he like?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing, but\nyou already know that, I told you over the phone just about everyday\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I have to see\nit to believe it\u201d she laughed wiping a tear from her eyes with an old handkerchief\nthat Anna had gotten her for mother&rsquo;s day when she was about 5. Harry waltzed\nover to them with all the bags and held his hand out to introduce himself. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet\nyou Mrs. Elliot, I\u2019m Harry\u201d </p><p>Anna cringed at the\nformal introduction, knowing that her mum would hate it, but what else was he\nsupposed to call her if Anna had already told him not to call her Debbie. </p><p>She covered his hand\nwith both of hers and smiled up at him \u201cThe pleasure is all mine Harry but\nplease, call me Debbie\u201d </p><p>He smiled and flashed\nhis dimples at her but he didn\u2019t know what to say next, like all of his\ncharisma had been left on that plane. </p><p>\u201cWell Debbie, your\ndaughter has changed my life, so I should thank you\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou two didn\u2019t elope\ndid you?\u201d she laughed nervously, half convinced that they had </p><p>\u201cNo Mum\u201d Anna shook\nher head </p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t even in\nvegas\u201d Harry said proudly. </p><p>\u201cGood because if my\ndaughter is going to marry a pop star I want to be at that wedding\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk mum, let\u2019s not to\nget too ahead of ourselves here\u201d Anna tried to steer the conversation away from\nmarriage, she didn\u2019t want to freak Harry out, it had only been three weeks of\nofficially dating after all and there were three little words that were yet to\nbe said. \u201c</p><p>\u201cAlright then kids\u201d\nDebbie broke the silence \u201cyou\u2019ve been on the go for months, let\u2019s get you home\u201d\n</p><p>*** </p><p>Since being home Anna\nhad been busier than ever, between setting up brand deals and revamping her\nblog so that it was easier to navigate and maintaining her daily posting\nschedule, she barely had time to breathe. But today she\u2019d promised that she\nwould put it all down and spend the day with Ronnie. Things with them had gone\nback to normal since she landed back on british soil which Anna was thankful for,\nshe had her best friend back, but they hadn\u2019t spoken about it. About why when\nshe said she was going away with Harry, he started ignoring her, why he didn\u2019t\nsay goodbye at the airport, or why, for the last 6 weeks he hadn\u2019t even\nbothered to send her a text to check in. \u00a0</p><p>It was such a nice\nday out that instead of spending the day locked up in Anna\u2019s flat they decided\nto go to peggy\u2019s, get a coffee sit outside and catch up on everything they\u2019d\nmissed. So Anna threw on a sundress, put her hair up in a messy bun, slipped on\nher favourite sandals and made sure she had a cardigan in her bag incase it got\ncold later. She would usually ride her bike to Peggy\u2019s but she wasn\u2019t feeling\nup to it today and she certainly wasn&rsquo;t dressed for it, so instead she opted to\ntake it slow and walk there at her own pace. The building was beautiful in\nsummer, covered in lovely pink flowers, with tiny garden tables sitting out the\nfront, where Anna saw Ronnie sitting, talking to the waitress who she was sure\nhe had a crush on. </p><p>\u201cHiya stranger\u201d she\nsaid as she approached the table and the waitress smiled at her and walked\naway. Ronnie stood and opened his arms, bringing her in for a hug. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have\nyou home\u201d he sighed, breaking the hug and sitting back down again.</p><p>\u201cHave you ordered?\u201d\nshe asked, sitting down and draping her handbag over the chair </p><p>\u201cYeah, Bella knows\nour order\u201d he said </p><p>\u201cBella?!\u201d Anna said,\nraising her eyebrows </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he said bluntly,\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t date\u201d </p><p>She rolled her eyes\n\u201cYou should\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u201d he laughed\n\u201cnow you\u2019re happy and in love you think everyone else should be too\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just think you\nshould put yourself out there more, you\u2019re 24, live a little\u201d </p><p>\u201cSays the girl who\nflew halfway across the world with a stranger just so she could get to know him\nbetter, that\u2019s living a little too much don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worked out though\ndidn\u2019t it?\u201d she wasn\u2019t going to give him the chance to tread on her\nrelationship with Harry when in reality he didn\u2019t know anything about it. </p><p>Bella, the waitress,\nwalked out the door towards their table, carrying a tray with their drinks on\nit wide smile plastered on her face as soon she made made eye contact with\nRonnie. She put the drinks down in front of them, without saying anything and\nbrushed her hand over Ronnie\u2019s shoulder as she walked away. Anna looked at him\ncuriously and he just shrugged his shoulders, blowing her off before she could\nask about it again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo when do I get to\nmeet him then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen you decide that\nyou don\u2019t hate me for making it work\u201d Anna said bitterly, refusing to make eye\ncontact with him. She looked down at the steaming coffee that was sitting in\nfront of her, and the ill feeling that was now a constant suddenly got worse at\nthe thought of drinking it. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you\nAnna, I could never hate you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why are you so\nbitter?\u201d she said, still looking down </p><p>\u201cYou never tried to\nmake it work with me\u201d he said softly </p><p>It always came back\nto this. To that night that they promised each other they wouldn\u2019t speak about\nagain. It was years ago, they\u2019d only just moved to London, they didn\u2019t know\nanyone else in the city and they were drunk. It never meant anything to Anna,\nbut it did to Ronnie and it came up everytime Anna started dating someone new,\nand even more so when it ended. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through\nthis Ron, we\u2019re friends, I couldn\u2019t live without you, but friendship is where\nit ends\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know\u201d he shook his\nhead \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know I\u2019m not supposed to bring it up\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was four years\nago Ron, this is why you need to get out there\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just pretend I\nnever said anything yeah?\u201d he sighed and took a sip from his drink. \u201cHow was\nthe tour?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI had the time of my\nlife\u201d she smiled \u201cYou remember the london shows and how happy everyone in that\nroom was?\u201d </p><p>Ronnie nodded </p><p>\u201cWell it was like\nthat every night, and Harry is incredible, everything about it was amazing\u201d\nAnna could talk about for hours if she wanted to, but she knew that Ronnie\ndidn\u2019t want to hear it</p><p>\u201cWas New York as good\nas you\u2019d hoped?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat was when we got\nfound out, so no, but it had nothing to do with the city\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\nwent out in Central Park if you wanted to keep it quiet\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was Harry\u2019s idea\u201d\nshe said \u201cHang on, how do you know about that, I never told you\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was all over the\nnews\u201d he said casually, \u201cI kept up, even if we weren\u2019t talking\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s phone that was\nsitting on the table in front of her buzzed and drew her away from the\nconversation. </p><p><i>\u201c<b>Styles </b></i><i><b>\ud83d\udd7a</b></i><i> Did you make that appointment yet?\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cIs that the knight\nin shining armor?\u201d Ronnie chuckled </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she grinned\n\u201cHe\u2019s just checking in.\u201d</p>",

The tour was over and Anna was about to fly back to London, back to her\nnormal life, as if the last few weeks hadn\u2019t changed everything. Nothing could\nbe the same now, not for her or her blog. It was strange to think that it was\nonly a few months ago that she was sitting at her desk, with her head in her\nhands trying her best to get her essay written, only to decide to drop out a\nfew hours later. That seemed like a lifetime ago, Ronnie was speaking to her\nback then, her blog was simply a hobby and Harry was Harry Styles the popstar,\nnot Harry Styles her boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cHow do you do it H?\u201d\nAnna asked Harry in the back of the car on the way to LAX. </p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he said</p><p>\u201cGo back to your\nnormal life after all this?\u201d </p><p>He turned his head\nand looked out the window at the passing trees that lined the streets. </p><p>\u201cThis is my normal\u201d\nhe sighed \u201cFor the better part of the last 8 years I\u2019ve been on the road, all\nof this is normal to me, my life is here in LA just as much as it is in London,\nI almost hate that I\u2019m leaving so soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kinda what I\nmean, how do you go back to London and just live after all this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird at first,\nbut I\u2019ll have you to keep me busy, plus I have an album to write so instead of\nplaying these songs to thousands everyday, I\u2019ll be in the studio writing new\nones\u201d </p><p>\u201cObviously all about\nme\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cHow could they not\nbe\u201d he smiled, wrapping his arm around her and bringing her into his chest\n\u201cyou\u2019re incredible An, changed my life\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s heart\nfluttered, she wanted nothing more than to say those three little words, but\nshe wasn\u2019t sure that he was ready to hear it. </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the one\nwhose life has been changed\u201d she opted out, this wasn\u2019t the time, she wasn\u2019t\nsure there would ever be a perfect time to say it, but this was an ending, and\nthose words were meant for a beginning. </p><p>He kissed her on the\nforehead \u201cBoth of us\u201d </p><p>In the background of\ntheir conversation the car pulled up and the driver switched it off. </p><p>\u201cLAX\u201d he said\nbringing them back to reality. </p><p>Anna looked out the\nwindow at the hundreds of people going about their day, going on holiday, or on\nbusiness trips, going home or going away and she gulped at how many of them\nwould know who Harry is. She was still hesitant about being seen with him,\nespecially in public places like airports, it wasn\u2019t that she was embarrassed\nor anything, it was just that she hated people staring at her and she hated even\nmore the articles that would no doubt be out by the time they arrive in London.\n<i>\u201cAnna Elliot uses Harry Styles to get more followers\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cYou know what this\nreminds me of?\u201d Harry said, pulling Anna back into the conversation</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOur first date\u201d he\nsmiled \u201cbut this time we\u2019re both getting out of the car\u201d </p><p>And so they did.\nHarry jumped out first and loaded their bags onto a trolley and took Anna\u2019s\nhand in his. </p><p>Airports made Anna\nnervous, this was only the second time she\u2019d ever been on an international\nflight, the first on the way over here, but there were some perks to being\nHarry Styles and one of them was skipping the queues. They went straight\nthrough security, and onto the first class lounge, where they were brought two\nglasses of champagne and some fresh fruit to munch on while they waited to\nboard. </p><p>\u201cThank you Harry\u201d\nAnna said when there was a lul in the conversation. </p><p>\u201cWhat for love?\u201d he\nasked curiously </p><p>\u201cInviting me on tour\nwith you, I know I\u2019ve told you that I\u2019m glad I came, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve\nthanked you for everything\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to\nthank me An, I should be thanking you, for dropping everything for a month and\na half to spend some more time with me\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be\nweird not waking up next to you everyday\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can have\nsleepovers\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cFlight 237 to London\nis now boarding\u201d a voice came over the loudspeaker alerting them to their\nimpending flight. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us\u201d Harry\nsaid, standing up and picking up their bags. \u201cYou going to finish that?\u201d he\npointed to Anna\u2019s almost full glass of champagne</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she shook her\nhead \u201cstill feeling a bit funny\u201d Those stomach aches had only gotten worse over\nthe last few weeks of the tour, to the point where they no longer went away,\nthey weren\u2019t always crippling, but they were there, lingering, reminding Anna\nsomething wasn\u2019t right. She\u2019d promised Harry that as soon as they got home\nshe\u2019d make an appointment with her G.P, just to make sure everything was ok. </p><p>He gave her a\nconcerned look, but still reached down and grabbed the glass, downing the whole\nthing in one go and shrugging when he put it down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a nervous\nflyer\u201d he admitted \u201cand if you don\u2019t make that appointment the minute we get\nhome, I\u2019ll be doing it for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised I\u2019d do it\nStyles\u201d she smiled and started walking towards their gate. </p><p>The flight wasn\u2019t\npacked by any stretch of the imagination, in fact, Anna and Harry were the only\none\u2019s in first class and Anna was glad to have their privacy. Home was so close\nand it wasn\u2019t until now that Anna realised how much she\u2019d missed it. </p><p>The seatbelt light\nflashed red and the flight attendant gave the safety demonstration to which\nboth Anna and Harry paid very close attention and once it was over and the\nplane was happily soaring through the sky, Anna took out her laptop and started\ntyping. Her holiday was over now but that wasn\u2019t official until there was a\nblog post about it. </p><p><b><i>The End of an Era</i></b></p><p><i>Ok, I admit the title\nof this post sounds a little dramatic but hear me out. On April 7th 2017, Harry\nreleased his first solo single which now holds a lot of meaning for a lot of\npeople, myself included and yesterday, on July 14th 2018, he performed the\nfinal show of the world tour for that album. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Now, for those of you\nthat have been around so nice before H and I started dating you\u2019ll know that I\nwas fan, and I, like many of you, remember listening to \u201cSign of the Times\u201d for\nthe first time and thinking that this song was going to make a difference to my\nlife in some small way. </i></p><p><i>Flash forward to a\nyear later and I was at Harry\u2019s London show and that song that should have only\nmade a small difference to my life had suddenly made a huge difference. </i></p><p><i>These last few months\nhave been a whirlwind but I wouldn\u2019t change any of it for the world. I\u2019m\nwriting this post as I sit on the plane on my way back to London and I\u2019m filled\nwith all sorts of feelings about it all being over. On the one hand, I\u2019m happy\nto be going home and seeing my friends and family again but on the other, I\u2019ve\nhad the time of my life on tour and I\u2019ll be missing everyone that I\u2019ve met\nalong the way. No matter what happens with Harry and I, I will forever be\ngrateful for all of the fun that I\u2019ve had on this tour for all of the memories\nI\u2019ve made and all of the chances I\u2019ve had to meet you guys. Every night at\nevery show I watched thousands of people sing along to Harry\u2019s lyrics and some\nnights, some people would see me singing along and come and join me and those\nare some of the happiest memories that I have. </i></p><p><i>Harry and I would arrive\nat each venue around 5pm every night, and when we got there, all 83 members of\nthe crew would have everything all set up and ready for soundcheck. I know\nHarry thanked them every night, but their work was truly tireless and I\u2019m\npretty sure most of them only slept a few hours a night, so I thought I\u2019d take\nthis opportunity to thank them as well, because without them the tour wouldn\u2019t\nhave happened and I wouldn\u2019t have had all the fun that I did. </i></p><p><i>Before I go, I have a\nstory to tell, for Clare Uchima, who told me to write about Ping Pong, back\nbefore you all knew about me and Harry and I decided not to incase you put it\nall together, which I\u2019m sure many of you did anyway. \u00a0I have never been\none known for her sporting abilities, but backstage on this tour, there was a\nping pong tournament. Now, Harry ended up winning and you can decide for\nyourselves whether it was rigged or not, but that\u2019s not the point of this\nstory. The tournament was organised by yours truly and it gave me the chance to\nget to know everyone on the crew. It all came to an end at Madison Square\nGarden, and everyone gathered around to watch the final match and that\u2019s how\nI\u2019d characterise the tour, supportive, friendly and above all kind. Treat\nPeople with Kindness was more than a slogan on a t-shirt, it was everything\nthat mattered on the Harry Styles world tour and it\u2019s a big part of why Harry\nand I are an item. </i></p><p><i>As for an update on\nmy plans for this blog now that I\u2019ll be home, I\u2019ll go back to posting daily\nagain, and there\u2019s lots of new content to come your way too.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m off to have a\nnanna nap now, thanks for sticking by me through this wonderful journey, I\ncan\u2019t wait for our next adventures. </i></p><p><i>Anna. x </i></p><p>Anna\u2019s Mum had\npromised to meet them at the airport and she was excited, but Harry was\nnervous. This would be their first meeting, and it would be at heathrow\nairport. He knew they wouldn\u2019t be there long and that most of their\nconversation would happen in the car and back at Anna\u2019s flat but that initial\nintroduction would in front of onlookers, something he should be comfortable\nwith by now and if this didn\u2019t mean so much to him, it would be different, but\nhe needed to make a good impression. </p><p>\u201cYou alright H?\u201d Anna\nasked, watching Harry fidget in his seat just before they were about to land. </p><p>\u201cI just realised that\nI\u2019m meeting your mum as soon as we get off this plane\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely\nwoman\u201d Anna yawned </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that\u201d\nhe smiled \u201cshe raised you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat she did\u201d Anna\nrested her head on his shoulder \u201cso her name is Debbie, but let her introduce\nherself first, she hates when people know her name without her telling them\nfirst\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat seems fair\u201d he\nsaid, running his fingers through her hair </p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t be too intense\nwith the eye contact, she hates that\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike mother, like\ndaughter\u201d he sighed \u201canything else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really, we\u2019re\nessentially the same person, so if you won me over you\u2019ll be able to win her\nover pretty easily\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kiss her\nthough\u201d he giggled. The plane was landing and they were trying to keep\nthemselves distracted but as the wheels hit the runway, less than smoothly,\nthey both flinched. </p><p>\u201cI hate planes\u201d Harry\nsighed </p><p>\u201cYou really should\nconsider a less international career then\u201d she laughed. </p><p>Now that the plane\nwas safely on the ground, Harry was feeling more nervous than ever. He may be\nable to get on stage in front of thousands of people every night with ease, but\nmeeting Anna\u2019s mother was absolutely terrifying. Especially when he was tired and\ndry from the flight. </p><p>Being in first class\nthey were the first to leave the plane and once again, because he was Harry\nStyles and he spent a lot of time at heathrow airport, they were fast tracked\nstraight to customs and onto baggage claim. Their bags rolled in and both\npicked them up. </p><p>\u201cNo no no\u201d Harry\nsaid, taking Anna\u2019s bag from her \u201cCan\u2019t have your mum thinking I\u2019m not a\ngentleman\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make her\nthink you\u2019re a mad man if you\u2019re trying to wheel two suitcases behind you, it\u2019s\non wheels, I\u2019ll manage\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine\u201d he sighed \u201cYou\nfeeling alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling like I\nwant to go home\u201d she snapped playfully \u201cand please don\u2019t say anything to mum\nabout me not being well this whole time, it\u2019ll will just worry her\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worries me\u201d he\nadmitted, putting his arm over her shoulder \u201ccome on Elliot, let\u2019s get you\nhome\u201d </p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s at the\narrivals gate\u201d she rested her head against his shoulder as they walked and\nignored everyone that stared at them along the way. It was reasonably quiet for\nan airport this big and they didn\u2019t have to weave their way through hundreds of\npeople to get to Anna\u2019s mum. </p><p>As soon as Debbie was\nin sight, Anna pulled away from Harry and left her bag with him \u00a0so that\nshe could hug her mum. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long my\nlove, I\u2019ve missed you\u201d Debbie said into Anna\u2019s shoulder without breaking the\nhug \u201cHow was it? What\u2019s he like?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing, but\nyou already know that, I told you over the phone just about everyday\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I have to see\nit to believe it\u201d she laughed wiping a tear from her eyes with an old handkerchief\nthat Anna had gotten her for mother\u2019s day when she was about 5. Harry waltzed\nover to them with all the bags and held his hand out to introduce himself. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet\nyou Mrs. Elliot, I\u2019m Harry\u201d </p><p>Anna cringed at the\nformal introduction, knowing that her mum would hate it, but what else was he\nsupposed to call her if Anna had already told him not to call her Debbie. </p><p>She covered his hand\nwith both of hers and smiled up at him \u201cThe pleasure is all mine Harry but\nplease, call me Debbie\u201d </p><p>He smiled and flashed\nhis dimples at her but he didn\u2019t know what to say next, like all of his\ncharisma had been left on that plane. </p><p>\u201cWell Debbie, your\ndaughter has changed my life, so I should thank you\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou two didn\u2019t elope\ndid you?\u201d she laughed nervously, half convinced that they had </p><p>\u201cNo Mum\u201d Anna shook\nher head </p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t even in\nvegas\u201d Harry said proudly. </p><p>\u201cGood because if my\ndaughter is going to marry a pop star I want to be at that wedding\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk mum, let\u2019s not to\nget too ahead of ourselves here\u201d Anna tried to steer the conversation away from\nmarriage, she didn\u2019t want to freak Harry out, it had only been three weeks of\nofficially dating after all and there were three little words that were yet to\nbe said. \u201c</p><p>\u201cAlright then kids\u201d\nDebbie broke the silence \u201cyou\u2019ve been on the go for months, let\u2019s get you home\u201d\n</p><p>*** </p><p>Since being home Anna\nhad been busier than ever, between setting up brand deals and revamping her\nblog so that it was easier to navigate and maintaining her daily posting\nschedule, she barely had time to breathe. But today she\u2019d promised that she\nwould put it all down and spend the day with Ronnie. Things with them had gone\nback to normal since she landed back on british soil which Anna was thankful for,\nshe had her best friend back, but they hadn\u2019t spoken about it. About why when\nshe said she was going away with Harry, he started ignoring her, why he didn\u2019t\nsay goodbye at the airport, or why, for the last 6 weeks he hadn\u2019t even\nbothered to send her a text to check in. \u00a0</p><p>It was such a nice\nday out that instead of spending the day locked up in Anna\u2019s flat they decided\nto go to peggy\u2019s, get a coffee sit outside and catch up on everything they\u2019d\nmissed. So Anna threw on a sundress, put her hair up in a messy bun, slipped on\nher favourite sandals and made sure she had a cardigan in her bag incase it got\ncold later. She would usually ride her bike to Peggy\u2019s but she wasn\u2019t feeling\nup to it today and she certainly wasn\u2019t dressed for it, so instead she opted to\ntake it slow and walk there at her own pace. The building was beautiful in\nsummer, covered in lovely pink flowers, with tiny garden tables sitting out the\nfront, where Anna saw Ronnie sitting, talking to the waitress who she was sure\nhe had a crush on. </p><p>\u201cHiya stranger\u201d she\nsaid as she approached the table and the waitress smiled at her and walked\naway. Ronnie stood and opened his arms, bringing her in for a hug. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have\nyou home\u201d he sighed, breaking the hug and sitting back down again.</p><p>\u201cHave you ordered?\u201d\nshe asked, sitting down and draping her handbag over the chair </p><p>\u201cYeah, Bella knows\nour order\u201d he said </p><p>\u201cBella?!\u201d Anna said,\nraising her eyebrows </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he said bluntly,\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t date\u201d </p><p>She rolled her eyes\n\u201cYou should\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u201d he laughed\n\u201cnow you\u2019re happy and in love you think everyone else should be too\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just think you\nshould put yourself out there more, you\u2019re 24, live a little\u201d </p><p>\u201cSays the girl who\nflew halfway across the world with a stranger just so she could get to know him\nbetter, that\u2019s living a little too much don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worked out though\ndidn\u2019t it?\u201d she wasn\u2019t going to give him the chance to tread on her\nrelationship with Harry when in reality he didn\u2019t know anything about it. </p><p>Bella, the waitress,\nwalked out the door towards their table, carrying a tray with their drinks on\nit wide smile plastered on her face as soon she made made eye contact with\nRonnie. She put the drinks down in front of them, without saying anything and\nbrushed her hand over Ronnie\u2019s shoulder as she walked away. Anna looked at him\ncuriously and he just shrugged his shoulders, blowing her off before she could\nask about it again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo when do I get to\nmeet him then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen you decide that\nyou don\u2019t hate me for making it work\u201d Anna said bitterly, refusing to make eye\ncontact with him. She looked down at the steaming coffee that was sitting in\nfront of her, and the ill feeling that was now a constant suddenly got worse at\nthe thought of drinking it. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you\nAnna, I could never hate you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why are you so\nbitter?\u201d she said, still looking down </p><p>\u201cYou never tried to\nmake it work with me\u201d he said softly </p><p>It always came back\nto this. To that night that they promised each other they wouldn\u2019t speak about\nagain. It was years ago, they\u2019d only just moved to London, they didn\u2019t know\nanyone else in the city and they were drunk. It never meant anything to Anna,\nbut it did to Ronnie and it came up everytime Anna started dating someone new,\nand even more so when it ended. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through\nthis Ron, we\u2019re friends, I couldn\u2019t live without you, but friendship is where\nit ends\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know\u201d he shook his\nhead \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know I\u2019m not supposed to bring it up\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was four years\nago Ron, this is why you need to get out there\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just pretend I\nnever said anything yeah?\u201d he sighed and took a sip from his drink. \u201cHow was\nthe tour?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI had the time of my\nlife\u201d she smiled \u201cYou remember the london shows and how happy everyone in that\nroom was?\u201d </p><p>Ronnie nodded </p><p>\u201cWell it was like\nthat every night, and Harry is incredible, everything about it was amazing\u201d\nAnna could talk about for hours if she wanted to, but she knew that Ronnie\ndidn\u2019t want to hear it</p><p>\u201cWas New York as good\nas you\u2019d hoped?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat was when we got\nfound out, so no, but it had nothing to do with the city\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\nwent out in Central Park if you wanted to keep it quiet\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was Harry\u2019s idea\u201d\nshe said \u201cHang on, how do you know about that, I never told you\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was all over the\nnews\u201d he said casually, \u201cI kept up, even if we weren\u2019t talking\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s phone that was\nsitting on the table in front of her buzzed and drew her away from the\nconversation. </p><p><i>\u201c<b>Styles </b></i><i><b>\ud83d\udd7a</b></i><i> Did you make that appointment yet?\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cIs that the knight\nin shining armor?\u201d Ronnie chuckled </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she grinned\n\u201cHe\u2019s just checking in.\u201d</p></p>",

The tour was over and Anna was about to fly back to London, back to her\nnormal life, as if the last few weeks hadn\u2019t changed everything. Nothing could\nbe the same now, not for her or her blog. It was strange to think that it was\nonly a few months ago that she was sitting at her desk, with her head in her\nhands trying her best to get her essay written, only to decide to drop out a\nfew hours later. That seemed like a lifetime ago, Ronnie was speaking to her\nback then, her blog was simply a hobby and Harry was Harry Styles the popstar,\nnot Harry Styles her boyfriend. </p><p>\u201cHow do you do it H?\u201d\nAnna asked Harry in the back of the car on the way to LAX. </p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he said</p><p>\u201cGo back to your\nnormal life after all this?\u201d </p><p>He turned his head\nand looked out the window at the passing trees that lined the streets. </p><p>\u201cThis is my normal\u201d\nhe sighed \u201cFor the better part of the last 8 years I\u2019ve been on the road, all\nof this is normal to me, my life is here in LA just as much as it is in London,\nI almost hate that I\u2019m leaving so soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kinda what I\nmean, how do you go back to London and just live after all this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird at first,\nbut I\u2019ll have you to keep me busy, plus I have an album to write so instead of\nplaying these songs to thousands everyday, I\u2019ll be in the studio writing new\nones\u201d </p><p>\u201cObviously all about\nme\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cHow could they not\nbe\u201d he smiled, wrapping his arm around her and bringing her into his chest\n\u201cyou\u2019re incredible An, changed my life\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s heart\nfluttered, she wanted nothing more than to say those three little words, but\nshe wasn\u2019t sure that he was ready to hear it. </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the one\nwhose life has been changed\u201d she opted out, this wasn\u2019t the time, she wasn\u2019t\nsure there would ever be a perfect time to say it, but this was an ending, and\nthose words were meant for a beginning. </p><p>He kissed her on the\nforehead \u201cBoth of us\u201d </p><p>In the background of\ntheir conversation the car pulled up and the driver switched it off. </p><p>\u201cLAX\u201d he said\nbringing them back to reality. </p><p>Anna looked out the\nwindow at the hundreds of people going about their day, going on holiday, or on\nbusiness trips, going home or going away and she gulped at how many of them\nwould know who Harry is. She was still hesitant about being seen with him,\nespecially in public places like airports, it wasn\u2019t that she was embarrassed\nor anything, it was just that she hated people staring at her and she hated even\nmore the articles that would no doubt be out by the time they arrive in London.\n<i>\u201cAnna Elliot uses Harry Styles to get more followers\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cYou know what this\nreminds me of?\u201d Harry said, pulling Anna back into the conversation</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOur first date\u201d he\nsmiled \u201cbut this time we\u2019re both getting out of the car\u201d </p><p>And so they did.\nHarry jumped out first and loaded their bags onto a trolley and took Anna\u2019s\nhand in his. </p><p>Airports made Anna\nnervous, this was only the second time she\u2019d ever been on an international\nflight, the first on the way over here, but there were some perks to being\nHarry Styles and one of them was skipping the queues. They went straight\nthrough security, and onto the first class lounge, where they were brought two\nglasses of champagne and some fresh fruit to munch on while they waited to\nboard. </p><p>\u201cThank you Harry\u201d\nAnna said when there was a lul in the conversation. </p><p>\u201cWhat for love?\u201d he\nasked curiously </p><p>\u201cInviting me on tour\nwith you, I know I\u2019ve told you that I\u2019m glad I came, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve\nthanked you for everything\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to\nthank me An, I should be thanking you, for dropping everything for a month and\na half to spend some more time with me\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be\nweird not waking up next to you everyday\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can have\nsleepovers\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cFlight 237 to London\nis now boarding\u201d a voice came over the loudspeaker alerting them to their\nimpending flight. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us\u201d Harry\nsaid, standing up and picking up their bags. \u201cYou going to finish that?\u201d he\npointed to Anna\u2019s almost full glass of champagne</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she shook her\nhead \u201cstill feeling a bit funny\u201d Those stomach aches had only gotten worse over\nthe last few weeks of the tour, to the point where they no longer went away,\nthey weren\u2019t always crippling, but they were there, lingering, reminding Anna\nsomething wasn\u2019t right. She\u2019d promised Harry that as soon as they got home\nshe\u2019d make an appointment with her G.P, just to make sure everything was ok. </p><p>He gave her a\nconcerned look, but still reached down and grabbed the glass, downing the whole\nthing in one go and shrugging when he put it down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a nervous\nflyer\u201d he admitted \u201cand if you don\u2019t make that appointment the minute we get\nhome, I\u2019ll be doing it for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised I\u2019d do it\nStyles\u201d she smiled and started walking towards their gate. </p><p>The flight wasn\u2019t\npacked by any stretch of the imagination, in fact, Anna and Harry were the only\none\u2019s in first class and Anna was glad to have their privacy.

I\u2019m\nwriting this post as I sit on the plane on my way back to London and I\u2019m filled\nwith all sorts of feelings about it all being over. On the one hand, I\u2019m happy\nto be going home and seeing my friends and family again but on the other, I\u2019ve\nhad the time of my life on tour and I\u2019ll be missing everyone that I\u2019ve met\nalong the way. No matter what happens with Harry and I, I will forever be\ngrateful for all of the fun that I\u2019ve had on this tour for all of the memories\nI\u2019ve made and all of the chances I\u2019ve had to meet you guys. Every night at\nevery show I watched thousands of people sing along to Harry\u2019s lyrics and some\nnights, some people would see me singing along and come and join me and those\nare some of the happiest memories that I have. </i></p><p><i>Harry and I would arrive\nat each venue around 5pm every night, and when we got there, all 83 members of\nthe crew would have everything all set up and ready for soundcheck. I know\nHarry thanked them every night, but their work was truly tireless and I\u2019m\npretty sure most of them only slept a few hours a night, so I thought I\u2019d take\nthis opportunity to thank them as well, because without them the tour wouldn\u2019t\nhave happened and I wouldn\u2019t have had all the fun that I did. </i></p><p><i>Before I go, I have a\nstory to tell, for Clare Uchima, who told me to write about Ping Pong, back\nbefore you all knew about me and Harry and I decided not to incase you put it\nall together, which I\u2019m sure many of you did anyway. \u00a0I have never been\none known for her sporting abilities, but backstage on this tour, there was a\nping pong tournament. Now, Harry ended up winning and you can decide for\nyourselves whether it was rigged or not, but that\u2019s not the point of this\nstory. The tournament was organised by yours truly and it gave me the chance to\nget to know everyone on the crew. It all came to an end at Madison Square\nGarden, and everyone gathered around to watch the final match and that\u2019s how\nI\u2019d characterise the tour, supportive, friendly and above all kind. Treat\nPeople with Kindness was more than a slogan on a t-shirt, it was everything\nthat mattered on the Harry Styles world tour and it\u2019s a big part of why Harry\nand I are an item. </i></p><p><i>As for an update on\nmy plans for this blog now that I\u2019ll be home, I\u2019ll go back to posting daily\nagain, and there\u2019s lots of new content to come your way too.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m off to have a\nnanna nap now, thanks for sticking by me through this wonderful journey, I\ncan\u2019t wait for our next adventures. </i></p><p><i>Anna. x </i></p><p>Anna\u2019s Mum had\npromised to meet them at the airport and she was excited, but Harry was\nnervous. This would be their first meeting, and it would be at heathrow\nairport. He knew they wouldn\u2019t be there long and that most of their\nconversation would happen in the car and back at Anna\u2019s flat but that initial\nintroduction would in front of onlookers, something he should be comfortable\nwith by now and if this didn\u2019t mean so much to him, it would be different, but\nhe needed to make a good impression. </p><p>\u201cYou alright H?\u201d Anna\nasked, watching Harry fidget in his seat just before they were about to land. </p><p>\u201cI just realised that\nI\u2019m meeting your mum as soon as we get off this plane\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely\nwoman\u201d Anna yawned </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that\u201d\nhe smiled \u201cshe raised you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat she did\u201d Anna\nrested her head on his shoulder \u201cso her name is Debbie, but let her introduce\nherself first, she hates when people know her name without her telling them\nfirst\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat seems fair\u201d he\nsaid, running his fingers through her hair </p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t be too intense\nwith the eye contact, she hates that\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike mother, like\ndaughter\u201d he sighed \u201canything else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really, we\u2019re\nessentially the same person, so if you won me over you\u2019ll be able to win her\nover pretty easily\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kiss her\nthough\u201d he giggled. The plane was landing and they were trying to keep\nthemselves distracted but as the wheels hit the runway, less than smoothly,\nthey both flinched. </p><p>\u201cI hate planes\u201d Harry\nsighed </p><p>\u201cYou really should\nconsider a less international career then\u201d she laughed. </p><p>Now that the plane\nwas safely on the ground, Harry was feeling more nervous than ever. He may be\nable to get on stage in front of thousands of people every night with ease, but\nmeeting Anna\u2019s mother was absolutely terrifying. Especially when he was tired and\ndry from the flight. </p><p>Being in first class\nthey were the first to leave the plane and once again, because he was Harry\nStyles and he spent a lot of time at heathrow airport, they were fast tracked\nstraight to customs and onto baggage claim. Their bags rolled in and both\npicked them up. </p><p>\u201cNo no no\u201d Harry\nsaid, taking Anna\u2019s bag from her \u201cCan\u2019t have your mum thinking I\u2019m not a\ngentleman\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make her\nthink you\u2019re a mad man if you\u2019re trying to wheel two suitcases behind you, it\u2019s\non wheels, I\u2019ll manage\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine\u201d he sighed \u201cYou\nfeeling alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling like I\nwant to go home\u201d she snapped playfully \u201cand please don\u2019t say anything to mum\nabout me not being well this whole time, it\u2019ll will just worry her\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worries me\u201d he\nadmitted, putting his arm over her shoulder \u201ccome on Elliot, let\u2019s get you\nhome\u201d </p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s at the\narrivals gate\u201d she rested her head against his shoulder as they walked and\nignored everyone that stared at them along the way. It was reasonably quiet for\nan airport this big and they didn\u2019t have to weave their way through hundreds of\npeople to get to Anna\u2019s mum. </p><p>As soon as Debbie was\nin sight, Anna pulled away from Harry and left her bag with him \u00a0so that\nshe could hug her mum. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long my\nlove, I\u2019ve missed you\u201d Debbie said into Anna\u2019s shoulder without breaking the\nhug \u201cHow was it? What\u2019s he like?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing, but\nyou already know that, I told you over the phone just about everyday\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I have to see\nit to believe it\u201d she laughed wiping a tear from her eyes with an old handkerchief\nthat Anna had gotten her for mother\u2019s day when she was about 5. Harry waltzed\nover to them with all the bags and held his hand out to introduce himself. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet\nyou Mrs. Elliot, I\u2019m Harry\u201d </p><p>Anna cringed at the\nformal introduction, knowing that her mum would hate it, but what else was he\nsupposed to call her if Anna had already told him not to call her Debbie. </p><p>She covered his hand\nwith both of hers and smiled up at him \u201cThe pleasure is all mine Harry but\nplease, call me Debbie\u201d </p><p>He smiled and flashed\nhis dimples at her but he didn\u2019t know what to say next, like all of his\ncharisma had been left on that plane. </p><p>\u201cWell Debbie, your\ndaughter has changed my life, so I should thank you\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou two didn\u2019t elope\ndid you?\u201d she laughed nervously, half convinced that they had </p><p>\u201cNo Mum\u201d Anna shook\nher head </p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t even in\nvegas\u201d Harry said proudly. </p><p>\u201cGood because if my\ndaughter is going to marry a pop star I want to be at that wedding\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk mum, let\u2019s not to\nget too ahead of ourselves here\u201d Anna tried to steer the conversation away from\nmarriage, she didn\u2019t want to freak Harry out, it had only been three weeks of\nofficially dating after all and there were three little words that were yet to\nbe said. \u201c</p><p>\u201cAlright then kids\u201d\nDebbie broke the silence \u201cyou\u2019ve been on the go for months, let\u2019s get you home\u201d\n</p><p>*** </p><p>Since being home Anna\nhad been busier than ever, between setting up brand deals and revamping her\nblog so that it was easier to navigate and maintaining her daily posting\nschedule, she barely had time to breathe. But today she\u2019d promised that she\nwould put it all down and spend the day with Ronnie. Things with them had gone\nback to normal since she landed back on british soil which Anna was thankful for,\nshe had her best friend back, but they hadn\u2019t spoken about it. About why when\nshe said she was going away with Harry, he started ignoring her, why he didn\u2019t\nsay goodbye at the airport, or why, for the last 6 weeks he hadn\u2019t even\nbothered to send her a text to check in. \u00a0</p><p>It was such a nice\nday out that instead of spending the day locked up in Anna\u2019s flat they decided\nto go to peggy\u2019s, get a coffee sit outside and catch up on everything they\u2019d\nmissed. So Anna threw on a sundress, put her hair up in a messy bun, slipped on\nher favourite sandals and made sure she had a cardigan in her bag incase it got\ncold later. She would usually ride her bike to Peggy\u2019s but she wasn\u2019t feeling\nup to it today and she certainly wasn\u2019t dressed for it, so instead she opted to\ntake it slow and walk there at her own pace. The building was beautiful in\nsummer, covered in lovely pink flowers, with tiny garden tables sitting out the\nfront, where Anna saw Ronnie sitting, talking to the waitress who she was sure\nhe had a crush on. </p><p>\u201cHiya stranger\u201d she\nsaid as she approached the table and the waitress smiled at her and walked\naway. Ronnie stood and opened his arms, bringing her in for a hug. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have\nyou home\u201d he sighed, breaking the hug and sitting back down again.</p><p>\u201cHave you ordered?\u201d\nshe asked, sitting down and draping her handbag over the chair </p><p>\u201cYeah, Bella knows\nour order\u201d he said </p><p>\u201cBella?!\u201d Anna said,\nraising her eyebrows </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he said bluntly,\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t date\u201d </p><p>She rolled her eyes\n\u201cYou should\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah\u201d he laughed\n\u201cnow you\u2019re happy and in love you think everyone else should be too\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just think you\nshould put yourself out there more, you\u2019re 24, live a little\u201d </p><p>\u201cSays the girl who\nflew halfway across the world with a stranger just so she could get to know him\nbetter, that\u2019s living a little too much don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worked out though\ndidn\u2019t it?\u201d she wasn\u2019t going to give him the chance to tread on her\nrelationship with Harry when in reality he didn\u2019t know anything about it. </p><p>Bella, the waitress,\nwalked out the door towards their table, carrying a tray with their drinks on\nit wide smile plastered on her face as soon she made made eye contact with\nRonnie. She put the drinks down in front of them, without saying anything and\nbrushed her hand over Ronnie\u2019s shoulder as she walked away. Anna looked at him\ncuriously and he just shrugged his shoulders, blowing her off before she could\nask about it again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo when do I get to\nmeet him then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen you decide that\nyou don\u2019t hate me for making it work\u201d Anna said bitterly, refusing to make eye\ncontact with him. She looked down at the steaming coffee that was sitting in\nfront of her, and the ill feeling that was now a constant suddenly got worse at\nthe thought of drinking it. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you\nAnna, I could never hate you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why are you so\nbitter?\u201d she said, still looking down </p><p>\u201cYou never tried to\nmake it work with me\u201d he said softly </p><p>It always came back\nto this. To that night that they promised each other they wouldn\u2019t speak about\nagain. It was years ago, they\u2019d only just moved to London, they didn\u2019t know\nanyone else in the city and they were drunk. It never meant anything to Anna,\nbut it did to Ronnie and it came up everytime Anna started dating someone new,\nand even more so when it ended. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through\nthis Ron, we\u2019re friends, I couldn\u2019t live without you, but friendship is where\nit ends\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know\u201d he shook his\nhead \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know I\u2019m not supposed to bring it up\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was four years\nago Ron, this is why you need to get out there\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just pretend I\nnever said anything yeah?\u201d he sighed and took a sip from his drink. \u201cHow was\nthe tour?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI had the time of my\nlife\u201d she smiled \u201cYou remember the london shows and how happy everyone in that\nroom was?\u201d </p><p>Ronnie nodded </p><p>\u201cWell it was like\nthat every night, and Harry is incredible, everything about it was amazing\u201d\nAnna could talk about for hours if she wanted to, but she knew that Ronnie\ndidn\u2019t want to hear it</p><p>\u201cWas New York as good\nas you\u2019d hoped?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat was when we got\nfound out, so no, but it had nothing to do with the city\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\nwent out in Central Park if you wanted to keep it quiet\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was Harry\u2019s idea\u201d\nshe said \u201cHang on, how do you know about that, I never told you\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was all over the\nnews\u201d he said casually, \u201cI kept up, even if we weren\u2019t talking\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s phone that was\nsitting on the table in front of her buzzed and drew her away from the\nconversation. </p><p><i>\u201c<b>Styles </b></i><i><b>\ud83d\udd7a</b></i><i> Did you make that appointment yet?\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cIs that the knight\nin shining armor?\u201d Ronnie chuckled </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she grinned\n\u201cHe\u2019s just checking in.\u201d</p></p>",

The tour was over and Anna was about to fly back to London, back to her\nnormal life, as if the last few weeks hadn&rsquo;t changed everything. Nothing could\nbe the same now, not for her or her blog. It was strange to think that it was\nonly a few months ago that she was sitting at her desk, with her head in her\nhands trying her best to get her essay written, only to decide to drop out a\nfew hours later. That seemed like a lifetime ago, Ronnie was speaking to her\nback then, her blog was simply a hobby and Harry was Harry Styles the popstar,\nnot Harry Styles her boyfriend. </p><p>&ldquo;How do you do it H?&rdquo;\nAnna asked Harry in the back of the car on the way to LAX. </p><p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; he said</p><p>&ldquo;Go back to your\nnormal life after all this?&rdquo; </p><p>He turned his head\nand looked out the window at the passing trees that lined the streets. </p><p>&ldquo;This is my normal&rdquo;\nhe sighed &ldquo;For the better part of the last 8 years I&rsquo;ve been on the road, all\nof this is normal to me, my life is here in LA just as much as it is in London,\nI almost hate that I&rsquo;m leaving so soon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kinda what I\nmean, how do you go back to London and just live after all this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird at first,\nbut I&rsquo;ll have you to keep me busy, plus I have an album to write so instead of\nplaying these songs to thousands everyday, I&rsquo;ll be in the studio writing new\nones&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Obviously all about\nme&rdquo; she giggled </p><p>&ldquo;How could they not\nbe&rdquo; he smiled, wrapping his arm around her and bringing her into his chest\n&ldquo;you&rsquo;re incredible An, changed my life&rdquo; </p><p>Anna&rsquo;s heart\nfluttered, she wanted nothing more than to say those three little words, but\nshe wasn&rsquo;t sure that he was ready to hear it. </p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m the one\nwhose life has been changed&rdquo; she opted out, this wasn&rsquo;t the time, she wasn&rsquo;t\nsure there would ever be a perfect time to say it, but this was an ending, and\nthose words were meant for a beginning. </p><p>He kissed her on the\nforehead &ldquo;Both of us&rdquo; </p><p>In the background of\ntheir conversation the car pulled up and the driver switched it off. </p><p>&ldquo;LAX&rdquo; he said\nbringing them back to reality. </p><p>Anna looked out the\nwindow at the hundreds of people going about their day, going on holiday, or on\nbusiness trips, going home or going away and she gulped at how many of them\nwould know who Harry is. She was still hesitant about being seen with him,\nespecially in public places like airports, it wasn&rsquo;t that she was embarrassed\nor anything, it was just that she hated people staring at her and she hated even\nmore the articles that would no doubt be out by the time they arrive in London.\n<i>&ldquo;Anna Elliot uses Harry Styles to get more followers&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;You know what this\nreminds me of?&rdquo; Harry said, pulling Anna back into the conversation</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Our first date&rdquo; he\nsmiled &ldquo;but this time we&rsquo;re both getting out of the car&rdquo; </p><p>And so they did.\nHarry jumped out first and loaded their bags onto a trolley and took Anna&rsquo;s\nhand in his. </p><p>Airports made Anna\nnervous, this was only the second time she&rsquo;d ever been on an international\nflight, the first on the way over here, but there were some perks to being\nHarry Styles and one of them was skipping the queues. They went straight\nthrough security, and onto the first class lounge, where they were brought two\nglasses of champagne and some fresh fruit to munch on while they waited to\nboard. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Harry&rdquo;\nAnna said when there was a lul in the conversation. </p><p>&ldquo;What for love?&rdquo; he\nasked curiously </p><p>&ldquo;Inviting me on tour\nwith you, I know I&rsquo;ve told you that I&rsquo;m glad I came, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve\nthanked you for everything&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to\nthank me An, I should be thanking you, for dropping everything for a month and\na half to spend some more time with me&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be\nweird not waking up next to you everyday&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We can have\nsleepovers&rdquo; he smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Flight 237 to London\nis now boarding&rdquo; a voice came over the loudspeaker alerting them to their\nimpending flight. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s us&rdquo; Harry\nsaid, standing up and picking up their bags. &ldquo;You going to finish that?&rdquo; he\npointed to Anna&rsquo;s almost full glass of champagne</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she shook her\nhead &ldquo;still feeling a bit funny&rdquo; Those stomach aches had only gotten worse over\nthe last few weeks of the tour, to the point where they no longer went away,\nthey weren&rsquo;t always crippling, but they were there, lingering, reminding Anna\nsomething wasn&rsquo;t right. She&rsquo;d promised Harry that as soon as they got home\nshe&rsquo;d make an appointment with her G.P, just to make sure everything was ok. </p><p>He gave her a\nconcerned look, but still reached down and grabbed the glass, downing the whole\nthing in one go and shrugging when he put it down. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still a nervous\nflyer&rdquo; he admitted &ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t make that appointment the minute we get\nhome, I&rsquo;ll be doing it for you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I promised I&rsquo;d do it\nStyles&rdquo; she smiled and started walking towards their gate. </p><p>The flight wasn&rsquo;t\npacked by any stretch of the imagination, in fact, Anna and Harry were the only\none&rsquo;s in first class and Anna was glad to have their privacy. Home was so close\nand it wasn&rsquo;t until now that Anna realised how much she&rsquo;d missed it. </p><p>The seatbelt light\nflashed red and the flight attendant gave the safety demonstration to which\nboth Anna and Harry paid very close attention and once it was over and the\nplane was happily soaring through the sky, Anna took out her laptop and started\ntyping. Her holiday was over now but that wasn&rsquo;t official until there was a\nblog post about it. </p><p><b><i>The End of an Era</i></b></p><p><i>Ok, I admit the title\nof this post sounds a little dramatic but hear me out.

I know\nHarry thanked them every night, but their work was truly tireless and I&rsquo;m\npretty sure most of them only slept a few hours a night, so I thought I&rsquo;d take\nthis opportunity to thank them as well, because without them the tour wouldn&rsquo;t\nhave happened and I wouldn&rsquo;t have had all the fun that I did. </i></p><p><i>Before I go, I have a\nstory to tell, for Clare Uchima, who told me to write about Ping Pong, back\nbefore you all knew about me and Harry and I decided not to incase you put it\nall together, which I&rsquo;m sure many of you did anyway. &nbsp;I have never been\none known for her sporting abilities, but backstage on this tour, there was a\nping pong tournament. Now, Harry ended up winning and you can decide for\nyourselves whether it was rigged or not, but that&rsquo;s not the point of this\nstory. The tournament was organised by yours truly and it gave me the chance to\nget to know everyone on the crew. It all came to an end at Madison Square\nGarden, and everyone gathered around to watch the final match and that&rsquo;s how\nI&rsquo;d characterise the tour, supportive, friendly and above all kind. Treat\nPeople with Kindness was more than a slogan on a t-shirt, it was everything\nthat mattered on the Harry Styles world tour and it&rsquo;s a big part of why Harry\nand I are an item. </i></p><p><i>As for an update on\nmy plans for this blog now that I&rsquo;ll be home, I&rsquo;ll go back to posting daily\nagain, and there&rsquo;s lots of new content to come your way too.</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m off to have a\nnanna nap now, thanks for sticking by me through this wonderful journey, I\ncan&rsquo;t wait for our next adventures. </i></p><p><i>Anna. x </i></p><p>Anna&rsquo;s Mum had\npromised to meet them at the airport and she was excited, but Harry was\nnervous. This would be their first meeting, and it would be at heathrow\nairport. He knew they wouldn&rsquo;t be there long and that most of their\nconversation would happen in the car and back at Anna&rsquo;s flat but that initial\nintroduction would in front of onlookers, something he should be comfortable\nwith by now and if this didn&rsquo;t mean so much to him, it would be different, but\nhe needed to make a good impression. </p><p>&ldquo;You alright H?&rdquo; Anna\nasked, watching Harry fidget in his seat just before they were about to land. </p><p>&ldquo;I just realised that\nI&rsquo;m meeting your mum as soon as we get off this plane&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a lovely\nwoman&rdquo; Anna yawned </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that&rdquo;\nhe smiled &ldquo;she raised you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That she did&rdquo; Anna\nrested her head on his shoulder &ldquo;so her name is Debbie, but let her introduce\nherself first, she hates when people know her name without her telling them\nfirst&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That seems fair&rdquo; he\nsaid, running his fingers through her hair </p><p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be too intense\nwith the eye contact, she hates that&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like mother, like\ndaughter&rdquo; he sighed &ldquo;anything else?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not really, we&rsquo;re\nessentially the same person, so if you won me over you&rsquo;ll be able to win her\nover pretty easily&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t kiss her\nthough&rdquo; he giggled. The plane was landing and they were trying to keep\nthemselves distracted but as the wheels hit the runway, less than smoothly,\nthey both flinched. </p><p>&ldquo;I hate planes&rdquo; Harry\nsighed </p><p>&ldquo;You really should\nconsider a less international career then&rdquo; she laughed. </p><p>Now that the plane\nwas safely on the ground, Harry was feeling more nervous than ever. He may be\nable to get on stage in front of thousands of people every night with ease, but\nmeeting Anna&rsquo;s mother was absolutely terrifying. Especially when he was tired and\ndry from the flight. </p><p>Being in first class\nthey were the first to leave the plane and once again, because he was Harry\nStyles and he spent a lot of time at heathrow airport, they were fast tracked\nstraight to customs and onto baggage claim. Their bags rolled in and both\npicked them up. </p><p>&ldquo;No no no&rdquo; Harry\nsaid, taking Anna&rsquo;s bag from her &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have your mum thinking I&rsquo;m not a\ngentleman&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make her\nthink you&rsquo;re a mad man if you&rsquo;re trying to wheel two suitcases behind you, it&rsquo;s\non wheels, I&rsquo;ll manage&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fine&rdquo; he sighed &ldquo;You\nfeeling alright?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling like I\nwant to go home&rdquo; she snapped playfully &ldquo;and please don&rsquo;t say anything to mum\nabout me not being well this whole time, it&rsquo;ll will just worry her&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It worries me&rdquo; he\nadmitted, putting his arm over her shoulder &ldquo;come on Elliot, let&rsquo;s get you\nhome&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s at the\narrivals gate&rdquo; she rested her head against his shoulder as they walked and\nignored everyone that stared at them along the way. It was reasonably quiet for\nan airport this big and they didn&rsquo;t have to weave their way through hundreds of\npeople to get to Anna&rsquo;s mum. </p><p>As soon as Debbie was\nin sight, Anna pulled away from Harry and left her bag with him &nbsp;so that\nshe could hug her mum. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long my\nlove, I&rsquo;ve missed you&rdquo; Debbie said into Anna&rsquo;s shoulder without breaking the\nhug &ldquo;How was it? What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s amazing, but\nyou already know that, I told you over the phone just about everyday&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well I have to see\nit to believe it&rdquo; she laughed wiping a tear from her eyes with an old handkerchief\nthat Anna had gotten her for mother&rsquo;s day when she was about 5. Harry waltzed\nover to them with all the bags and held his hand out to introduce himself. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely to meet\nyou Mrs. Elliot, I&rsquo;m Harry&rdquo; </p><p>Anna cringed at the\nformal introduction, knowing that her mum would hate it, but what else was he\nsupposed to call her if Anna had already told him not to call her Debbie. </p><p>She covered his hand\nwith both of hers and smiled up at him &ldquo;The pleasure is all mine Harry but\nplease, call me Debbie&rdquo; </p><p>He smiled and flashed\nhis dimples at her but he didn&rsquo;t know what to say next, like all of his\ncharisma had been left on that plane. </p><p>&ldquo;Well Debbie, your\ndaughter has changed my life, so I should thank you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You two didn&rsquo;t elope\ndid you?&rdquo; she laughed nervously, half convinced that they had </p><p>&ldquo;No Mum&rdquo; Anna shook\nher head </p><p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t even in\nvegas&rdquo; Harry said proudly. </p><p>&ldquo;Good because if my\ndaughter is going to marry a pop star I want to be at that wedding&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ok mum, let&rsquo;s not to\nget too ahead of ourselves here&rdquo; Anna tried to steer the conversation away from\nmarriage, she didn&rsquo;t want to freak Harry out, it had only been three weeks of\nofficially dating after all and there were three little words that were yet to\nbe said. &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright then kids&rdquo;\nDebbie broke the silence &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been on the go for months, let&rsquo;s get you home&rdquo;\n</p><p>*** </p><p>Since being home Anna\nhad been busier than ever, between setting up brand deals and revamping her\nblog so that it was easier to navigate and maintaining her daily posting\nschedule, she barely had time to breathe. But today she&rsquo;d promised that she\nwould put it all down and spend the day with Ronnie. Things with them had gone\nback to normal since she landed back on british soil which Anna was thankful for,\nshe had her best friend back, but they hadn&rsquo;t spoken about it. About why when\nshe said she was going away with Harry, he started ignoring her, why he didn&rsquo;t\nsay goodbye at the airport, or why, for the last 6 weeks he hadn&rsquo;t even\nbothered to send her a text to check in. &nbsp;</p><p>It was such a nice\nday out that instead of spending the day locked up in Anna&rsquo;s flat they decided\nto go to peggy&rsquo;s, get a coffee sit outside and catch up on everything they&rsquo;d\nmissed. So Anna threw on a sundress, put her hair up in a messy bun, slipped on\nher favourite sandals and made sure she had a cardigan in her bag incase it got\ncold later. She would usually ride her bike to Peggy&rsquo;s but she wasn&rsquo;t feeling\nup to it today and she certainly wasn&rsquo;t dressed for it, so instead she opted to\ntake it slow and walk there at her own pace. The building was beautiful in\nsummer, covered in lovely pink flowers, with tiny garden tables sitting out the\nfront, where Anna saw Ronnie sitting, talking to the waitress who she was sure\nhe had a crush on. </p><p>&ldquo;Hiya stranger&rdquo; she\nsaid as she approached the table and the waitress smiled at her and walked\naway. Ronnie stood and opened his arms, bringing her in for a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to have\nyou home&rdquo; he sighed, breaking the hug and sitting back down again.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ordered?&rdquo;\nshe asked, sitting down and draping her handbag over the chair </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Bella knows\nour order&rdquo; he said </p><p>&ldquo;Bella?!&rdquo; Anna said,\nraising her eyebrows </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; he said bluntly,\n&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t date&rdquo; </p><p>She rolled her eyes\n&ldquo;You should&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah&rdquo; he laughed\n&ldquo;now you&rsquo;re happy and in love you think everyone else should be too&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I just think you\nshould put yourself out there more, you&rsquo;re 24, live a little&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Says the girl who\nflew halfway across the world with a stranger just so she could get to know him\nbetter, that&rsquo;s living a little too much don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It worked out though\ndidn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she wasn&rsquo;t going to give him the chance to tread on her\nrelationship with Harry when in reality he didn&rsquo;t know anything about it. </p><p>Bella, the waitress,\nwalked out the door towards their table, carrying a tray with their drinks on\nit wide smile plastered on her face as soon she made made eye contact with\nRonnie. She put the drinks down in front of them, without saying anything and\nbrushed her hand over Ronnie&rsquo;s shoulder as she walked away. Anna looked at him\ncuriously and he just shrugged his shoulders, blowing her off before she could\nask about it again. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So when do I get to\nmeet him then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;When you decide that\nyou don&rsquo;t hate me for making it work&rdquo; Anna said bitterly, refusing to make eye\ncontact with him. She looked down at the steaming coffee that was sitting in\nfront of her, and the ill feeling that was now a constant suddenly got worse at\nthe thought of drinking it. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate you\nAnna, I could never hate you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you so\nbitter?&rdquo; she said, still looking down </p><p>&ldquo;You never tried to\nmake it work with me&rdquo; he said softly </p><p>It always came back\nto this. To that night that they promised each other they wouldn&rsquo;t speak about\nagain. It was years ago, they&rsquo;d only just moved to London, they didn&rsquo;t know\nanyone else in the city and they were drunk. It never meant anything to Anna,\nbut it did to Ronnie and it came up everytime Anna started dating someone new,\nand even more so when it ended. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through\nthis Ron, we&rsquo;re friends, I couldn&rsquo;t live without you, but friendship is where\nit ends&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know&rdquo; he shook his\nhead &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I know I&rsquo;m not supposed to bring it up&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was four years\nago Ron, this is why you need to get out there&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just pretend I\nnever said anything yeah?&rdquo; he sighed and took a sip from his drink. &ldquo;How was\nthe tour?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I had the time of my\nlife&rdquo; she smiled &ldquo;You remember the london shows and how happy everyone in that\nroom was?&rdquo; </p><p>Ronnie nodded </p><p>&ldquo;Well it was like\nthat every night, and Harry is incredible, everything about it was amazing&rdquo;\nAnna could talk about for hours if she wanted to, but she knew that Ronnie\ndidn&rsquo;t want to hear it</p><p>&ldquo;Was New York as good\nas you&rsquo;d hoped?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That was when we got\nfound out, so no, but it had nothing to do with the city&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you\nwent out in Central Park if you wanted to keep it quiet&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was Harry&rsquo;s idea&rdquo;\nshe said &ldquo;Hang on, how do you know about that, I never told you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was all over the\nnews&rdquo; he said casually, &ldquo;I kept up, even if we weren&rsquo;t talking&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; </p><p>Anna&rsquo;s phone that was\nsitting on the table in front of her buzzed and drew her away from the\nconversation. </p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Styles </b></i><i><b>&#128378;</b></i><i> Did you make that appointment yet?&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Is that the knight\nin shining armor?&rdquo; Ronnie chuckled </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; she grinned\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just checking in.&rdquo;</p></p>",
