Jenny T Colgan has written <i>Time Reaver</i>, while <i>Death and\nthe Queen</i> has come from the imagination of James Goss. </p><p><i>(Full Article Under\nCut)</i></p><!-- more --><p>Talking of this series, Matt says: \u201cIt had a long gestation\nperiod \u2013 when the licence first came through, we started thinking about\ndifferent ways of doing Tenth Doctor stories.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhen it became clear we had Donna as well, we sent a pitch\nto be approved by the BBC, so we could give them a concept of what we wanted to\ndo, story-wise. </p><p>\u201cWe decided to do something similar to the way they did\nthings with the TV series. The first one was going to be a story set in\ncontemporary London with a strange threat, so it was similar to a series opener\nof the era. The second story would be set in outer space, with something weird,\nwonderful and alien, and then the third story would be something possibly\nhistorical or a bit more emotional and based on Earth. </p><p>\u201cThese were the briefs that want out to Jenny and James, so\nthey were able to flesh out their stories. We had lots of exchanges of ideas,\nback and forth. </p><p>\u201cJames is a good, solid, clever writer who you know you can\nrely on. I was really pleased to get Jenny involved as we were keen to have\nsomething of a name attached to the series, and she is such a good writer who\nloves her <b>Doctor Who</b> too. It\u2019s great\nto have a Sunday Times best-selling writer with us!\u201d </p><p>In order for Matt to get the feel for the era again, he had\nto dig out his DVD collection.</p><p>In Technophobia, the Doctor and Donna visit London\u2019s\nTechnology Museum for a glimpse into the future, but things don\u2019t go to plan.\nThe most brilliant IT brain in the country can\u2019t use her computer. More\nworrying, the exhibits are attacking the visitors, while outside, people seem\nto be losing control of the technology that runs their lives. Is it all down to\nsimple human stupidity, or is something more sinister going on? Beneath the\nstreets, the Koggnossenti are waiting. For all of London to fall prey to\ntechnophobia&hellip; </p><p>Smiling, Matt says: \u201cIt was a question of going back and\nwatching the episodes again, which is what I do with the classic series. You\nwatch the episodes and how the characters work \u2013 the Doctor and Donna are just\nsuch vivid characters, as they are so full of life on screen. </p><p>\u201cI suppose there\u2019s an added pressure knowing you\u2019ve got\nDavid and Catherine performing your lines. Everyone knows Catherine\u2019s a brilliant\ncomedian and some people forget just how great an actress she is too \u2013 you want\nto give her something to really work with. </p><p>\u201cYou know David\u2019s so good and will be able to do anything\nyou give to him.\u201d </p><p>David Richardson says: \u201c<i>Technophobia</i>\nbegan life as something else altogether. I\u2019d been holding on to the idea for a\nstory about sleep deprivation \u2013 what would happen if the whole world lost the\nability to sleep? That was going to be our first episode. And then we submitted\nit to Cardiff, and of course <i>Sleep No\nMore</i> was planned for series nine on television, so there was a clash. Matt\nFitton rather brilliantly took the core idea and twisted it into something else\nentirely different but really clever.\u201d</p><h2><i>\u201cEveryone\nknows Catherine\u2019s a brilliant comedian, and some people forget just how great\nan actress she is too \u2013 you want to give her something to really work with.\u201d</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 Matt Fitton</i></p></blockquote><h2><b>Time Reaver</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"790\" data-orig-height=\"1184\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32815d233db6acd50e561a04a90084ac/tumblr_inline_ppuv2o6sG81rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"790\" data-orig-height=\"1184\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Jenny T Colgan wearing an \u201cI &lsquo;heart\nheart&rsquo; Gallifrey\u201d t-shirt.<b>]</b></i><br/></p></blockquote><p>The second adventure for the Doctor and Donna is Time\nReaver. Although Jenny \u2013 an accomplished romantic comedy novelist as well as a\nprolific writer of Doctor Who fiction \u2013 has since written a play for Big Finish\u2019s\nfirst River Song series, which was released earlier this year, she actually\nwrote her Tenth Doctor story first. </p><p>In <i>Time Reaver</i>,\nthe TARDIS lands on Calibris, the spaceport planet where anything goes. The\nalien Vacintians are trying to impose some order over the smugglers and pirates\nthat crowd the port. Soon the Doctor and Donna discover why. An illegal weapon\nis loose on the streets. A weapon that destroys lives&hellip; Slowly and\nagonisingly. The Time Reaver. </p><p>Despite having written for the Doctor several times in prose\n\u2013 including <i>In The Blood</i>, a new Tenth\nDoctor and Donna BBC novel being released this month to tie-in with the Big\nFinish audios \u2013 this was Jenny\u2019s first script, a fact she was extremely excited\nabout. </p><p>\u201cI never believed that people actually jump for joy but I\ndid actually hop around the kitchen a little bit. Then I was so terrified I\u2019d\nactually tell someone I got horribly paranoid. But it was an extremely exciting\nmoment. </p><p>\u201cI pitched a few things and they chose the one they liked.\nFunnily enough, Time Reaver is quite traditional sci-fi \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanical\ninterchange planet, like a massive interplanetary King\u2019s Cross \u2013 whereas my\nfriend and colleague James Goss has written one about Donna getting married, so\nit feels a bit like we\u2019re on each others\u2019 turf!\u201d </p><p>Jenny didn\u2019t feel the need to go back to watch some TV\nepisodes featuring the Doctor and Donna. </p><p>She explains: \u201cI\u2019ve written for four different Doctors and\nyou do have to shake their voices out of your head a little bit, just to give\nyourself a bit of a mental shake up because they\u2019re all so different. Matt Smith\nis nothing like Peter Capaldi who is obviously nothing like David, etc. The\nTenth Doctor understands human emotions, whereas the Eleventh gets a bit\nbamboozled by them, and the Twelfth understands in theory but he doesn\u2019t really\ncare very much \u2013 although he\u2019s learning&hellip; </p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t need to go back and watch series episodes, I\nwatch them all the time. I can recite <i>Forest\nof the Dead</i> off by heart (I shan\u2019t, but I can). <i>Silence in the Library</i> is a real touchstone for me. I have two\nTenth Doctor/Donna projects coming out in May: one is set just before <i>Library</i> and one just after <i>Midnight</i>. </p><p>\u201cHere is a funny thing; my kids were watching <i>Silence in the Library</i> last week because\nthe six- year-old is finally old enough to deal with the skeletons, and when\nRiver says \u2018Have we done picnic at Asgard yet?\u2019 (which I wrote this year for\nthe Eleventh Doctor and River), they all turned to me and went \u2018But how did you\nknow?\u2019 And then when he says \u2018Why would I give you my screwdriver?\u2019, they all\nwent, \u2018Because mummy wrote that you had a sonic trowel and the Doctor thought\nit was rubbish!\u2019. </p><p>\u201cIt was just so, so very lovely to be able to play with all\nof that when you\u2019re writing for Doctors past, and so very special to me.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Death and the Queen</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"460\" data-orig-height=\"690\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c9e72e6f6436d9a5a2fdf18a5ff25a0/tumblr_inline_ppuv8p5hXs1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"460\" data-orig-height=\"690\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i>\u00a0James Goss holding a cat.]</i><br/></p></blockquote><p><b></b></p><p>The concluding play in this first run of Tenth Doctor\nadventures is <i>Death and the Queen</i>, by\nJames Goss. As we\u2019ve seen in The Runaway Bride, and learned subsequently, Donna\nNoble has never been lucky in love. So when, one day, her Prince does come, she\nis thrilled to have the wedding of all weddings to look forward to. The Doctor\nisn\u2019t holding his breath for an invitation, and her future mother-in-law is\ncertainly not amused. But on the big day itself, Donna finds her castle under\nsiege from the darkest of forces, marching at the head of a skeleton army. When\nit looks like even the Doctor can\u2019t save the day, what will Queen Donna do to\nsave her people from Death itself? </p><p>James explains how the conversation went when he was asked\nto write the play: \u201cDavid Richardson: \u2018This is obviously top secret and you\ncan\u2019t tell anyone\u2019. </p><p>\u201cMe: \u2018I think I\u2019ve just told a whole train carriage\u2019.\u201d </p><p>James is no stranger to writing for the Tenth Doctor \u2013 his\nBBC Audio play <i>Dead Air</i>, read by\nDavid Tennant, was voted 2010 Audiobook of the Year. The award was selected by\nvoters visiting the Audiobook store. It beat other books nominated including <i>Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, Othello,\nAnimal Farm, Shakespeare in Love</i> and <i>War\nHorse</i>. </p><p>James wasn\u2019t given much of a brief for this tale, as he says\nhe was given: \u201cNot much really. Just keep the Doctor and Donna together as much\nas possible and have them having a great amount of fun. Which I hope they do.\n\u201cI had another idea which is also amazing!\u201d </p><p>With the script having been finished months before it was\nactually recorded, has it been a nervous wait for James? </p><p>\u201cNot really. So often these things are a tearing hurry, but\nthis was a nice sense of it sitting on a shelf, gently maturing. I re-read it\nthe night before the recording and sweated fear.\u201d </p><p>And is he excited to hear the finished play? </p><p>\u201cVERY. How else does anyone answer this? Donna Noble is\ngetting married again. The Tenth Doctor\u2019s trying to help. What could possibly\ngo wrong?\u201d \u00a0</p><h2><i>\u201cSo often\nthese things are a tearing hurry, but this was a nice sense of it sitting on a\nshelf, gently maturing.

He created both the Tenth Doctor and\nDonna, and in his role on TV, he oversaw every single word which came out of\ntheir mouths. </p><p>In an exclusive interview with this magazine, Vortex asked\nhim how odd does it feel, that a part of his time on <b>Doctor Who</b> is now being brought to life on audio by Big Finish? </p><p>He says: \u201cActually, yes, good question, because odd is the\nright word. Along with wonderful and exciting and brilliant. But I pored over\nevery single word the Doctor and Donna ever said to each other \u2013 apart from\nSteven Moffat\u2019s two-parter, I probably wrote most of their dialogue \u2013 so to not\nknow what they\u2019re going to say next is a little bit strange. Just a little bit!\nIn a good way. But really, I can\u2019t wait to hear those two actors riff off each\nother again. David and Catherine are such good friends in real life, there\u2019s a\ngenuine spark between the Doctor and Donna.\u201d </p><p>Russell wasn\u2019t involved with the storylines? </p><p>\u201cNot at all!\u201d, he says. \u201cWell, they ran them past me in\nsimple synopses, but it\u2019s Big Finish, they know what they\u2019re doing. And\nbesides, you can\u2019t make these things with someone sitting far away, trying to\nmeddle. It\u2019s a Big Finish licence, so it\u2019s a Big Finish show, it\u2019s their\nversion of the Doctor and Donna. And that\u2019s Big Finish\u2019s speciality \u2013\nrecreating eras faithfully but always finding something new to say.\u201d </p><p>And how excited is he to hear some new stories, being brought\nto life by David and Catherine? </p><p>\u201cVery! Those two, back in action, after all these years,\nit\u2019s an absolute joy. Just the other day, I was in Superdrug, and the woman at\nthe till asked if I wanted a bag, and I said no, I\u2019ll put it in my pocket, and\nshe sighed wistfully and said, \u2018Women don\u2019t have pockets.\u2019 And it made me think\nof Donna! I laughed to myself for about 10 minutes afterwards, remembering\nDonna\u2019s line about getting her wedding dress from Chez Alison. It made me think\nhow much I miss her. And bang on cue, here she is, back again! And I don\u2019t\nthink a single day passes without someone telling me how much they loved David\nas the Doctor. It\u2019s an honour to get him and Catherine back together.

The first one was going to be a story set in\ncontemporary London with a strange threat, so it was similar to a series opener\nof the era. The second story would be set in outer space, with something weird,\nwonderful and alien, and then the third story would be something possibly\nhistorical or a bit more emotional and based on Earth. </p><p>\u201cThese were the briefs that want out to Jenny and James, so\nthey were able to flesh out their stories. We had lots of exchanges of ideas,\nback and forth. </p><p>\u201cJames is a good, solid, clever writer who you know you can\nrely on. I was really pleased to get Jenny involved as we were keen to have\nsomething of a name attached to the series, and she is such a good writer who\nloves her <b>Doctor Who</b> too. It\u2019s great\nto have a Sunday Times best-selling writer with us!\u201d </p><p>In order for Matt to get the feel for the era again, he had\nto dig out his DVD collection.</p><p>In Technophobia, the Doctor and Donna visit London\u2019s\nTechnology Museum for a glimpse into the future, but things don\u2019t go to plan.\nThe most brilliant IT brain in the country can\u2019t use her computer. More\nworrying, the exhibits are attacking the visitors, while outside, people seem\nto be losing control of the technology that runs their lives. Is it all down to\nsimple human stupidity, or is something more sinister going on? Beneath the\nstreets, the Koggnossenti are waiting. For all of London to fall prey to\ntechnophobia\u2026 </p><p>Smiling, Matt says: \u201cIt was a question of going back and\nwatching the episodes again, which is what I do with the classic series. You\nwatch the episodes and how the characters work \u2013 the Doctor and Donna are just\nsuch vivid characters, as they are so full of life on screen. </p><p>\u201cI suppose there\u2019s an added pressure knowing you\u2019ve got\nDavid and Catherine performing your lines. Everyone knows Catherine\u2019s a brilliant\ncomedian and some people forget just how great an actress she is too \u2013 you want\nto give her something to really work with. </p><p>\u201cYou know David\u2019s so good and will be able to do anything\nyou give to him.\u201d </p><p>David Richardson says: \u201c<i>Technophobia</i>\nbegan life as something else altogether. I\u2019d been holding on to the idea for a\nstory about sleep deprivation \u2013 what would happen if the whole world lost the\nability to sleep? That was going to be our first episode. And then we submitted\nit to Cardiff, and of course <i>Sleep No\nMore</i> was planned for series nine on television, so there was a clash. Matt\nFitton rather brilliantly took the core idea and twisted it into something else\nentirely different but really clever.\u201d</p><h2><i>\u201cEveryone\nknows Catherine\u2019s a brilliant comedian, and some people forget just how great\nan actress she is too \u2013 you want to give her something to really work with.\u201d</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 Matt Fitton</i></p></blockquote><h2><b>Time Reaver</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"790\" data-orig-height=\"1184\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32815d233db6acd50e561a04a90084ac/tumblr_inline_ppuv2o6sG81rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"790\" data-orig-height=\"1184\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Jenny T Colgan wearing an \u201cI \u2018heart\nheart\u2019 Gallifrey\u201d t-shirt.<b>]</b></i><br></p></blockquote><p>The second adventure for the Doctor and Donna is Time\nReaver. Although Jenny \u2013 an accomplished romantic comedy novelist as well as a\nprolific writer of Doctor Who fiction \u2013 has since written a play for Big Finish\u2019s\nfirst River Song series, which was released earlier this year, she actually\nwrote her Tenth Doctor story first. </p><p>In <i>Time Reaver</i>,\nthe TARDIS lands on Calibris, the spaceport planet where anything goes. The\nalien Vacintians are trying to impose some order over the smugglers and pirates\nthat crowd the port. Soon the Doctor and Donna discover why. An illegal weapon\nis loose on the streets. A weapon that destroys lives\u2026 Slowly and\nagonisingly. The Time Reaver. </p><p>Despite having written for the Doctor several times in prose\n\u2013 including <i>In The Blood</i>, a new Tenth\nDoctor and Donna BBC novel being released this month to tie-in with the Big\nFinish audios \u2013 this was Jenny\u2019s first script, a fact she was extremely excited\nabout. </p><p>\u201cI never believed that people actually jump for joy but I\ndid actually hop around the kitchen a little bit. Then I was so terrified I\u2019d\nactually tell someone I got horribly paranoid. But it was an extremely exciting\nmoment. </p><p>\u201cI pitched a few things and they chose the one they liked.\nFunnily enough, Time Reaver is quite traditional sci-fi \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanical\ninterchange planet, like a massive interplanetary King\u2019s Cross \u2013 whereas my\nfriend and colleague James Goss has written one about Donna getting married, so\nit feels a bit like we\u2019re on each others\u2019 turf!\u201d </p><p>Jenny didn\u2019t feel the need to go back to watch some TV\nepisodes featuring the Doctor and Donna. </p><p>She explains: \u201cI\u2019ve written for four different Doctors and\nyou do have to shake their voices out of your head a little bit, just to give\nyourself a bit of a mental shake up because they\u2019re all so different. Matt Smith\nis nothing like Peter Capaldi who is obviously nothing like David, etc. The\nTenth Doctor understands human emotions, whereas the Eleventh gets a bit\nbamboozled by them, and the Twelfth understands in theory but he doesn\u2019t really\ncare very much \u2013 although he\u2019s learning\u2026 </p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t need to go back and watch series episodes, I\nwatch them all the time. I can recite <i>Forest\nof the Dead</i> off by heart (I shan\u2019t, but I can). <i>Silence in the Library</i> is a real touchstone for me. I have two\nTenth Doctor/Donna projects coming out in May: one is set just before <i>Library</i> and one just after <i>Midnight</i>. </p><p>\u201cHere is a funny thing; my kids were watching <i>Silence in the Library</i> last week because\nthe six- year-old is finally old enough to deal with the skeletons, and when\nRiver says \u2018Have we done picnic at Asgard yet?\u2019 (which I wrote this year for\nthe Eleventh Doctor and River), they all turned to me and went \u2018But how did you\nknow?\u2019 And then when he says \u2018Why would I give you my screwdriver?\u2019, they all\nwent, \u2018Because mummy wrote that you had a sonic trowel and the Doctor thought\nit was rubbish!\u2019. </p><p>\u201cIt was just so, so very lovely to be able to play with all\nof that when you\u2019re writing for Doctors past, and so very special to me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Death and the Queen</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"460\" data-orig-height=\"690\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c9e72e6f6436d9a5a2fdf18a5ff25a0/tumblr_inline_ppuv8p5hXs1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"460\" data-orig-height=\"690\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i>\u00a0James Goss holding a cat.]</i><br></p></blockquote><p><b></b></p><p>The concluding play in this first run of Tenth Doctor\nadventures is <i>Death and the Queen</i>, by\nJames Goss. As we\u2019ve seen in The Runaway Bride, and learned subsequently, Donna\nNoble has never been lucky in love. So when, one day, her Prince does come, she\nis thrilled to have the wedding of all weddings to look forward to. The Doctor\nisn\u2019t holding his breath for an invitation, and her future mother-in-law is\ncertainly not amused. But on the big day itself, Donna finds her castle under\nsiege from the darkest of forces, marching at the head of a skeleton army. When\nit looks like even the Doctor can\u2019t save the day, what will Queen Donna do to\nsave her people from Death itself? </p><p>James explains how the conversation went when he was asked\nto write the play: \u201cDavid Richardson: \u2018This is obviously top secret and you\ncan\u2019t tell anyone\u2019. </p><p>\u201cMe: \u2018I think I\u2019ve just told a whole train carriage\u2019.\u201d </p><p>James is no stranger to writing for the Tenth Doctor \u2013 his\nBBC Audio play <i>Dead Air</i>, read by\nDavid Tennant, was voted 2010 Audiobook of the Year. The award was selected by\nvoters visiting the Audiobook store. It beat other books nominated including <i>Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, Othello,\nAnimal Farm, Shakespeare in Love</i> and <i>War\nHorse</i>. </p><p>James wasn\u2019t given much of a brief for this tale, as he says\nhe was given: \u201cNot much really. Just keep the Doctor and Donna together as much\nas possible and have them having a great amount of fun. Which I hope they do.\n\u201cI had another idea which is also amazing!\u201d </p><p>With the script having been finished months before it was\nactually recorded, has it been a nervous wait for James? </p><p>\u201cNot really. So often these things are a tearing hurry, but\nthis was a nice sense of it sitting on a shelf, gently maturing. I re-read it\nthe night before the recording and sweated fear.\u201d </p><p>And is he excited to hear the finished play? </p><p>\u201cVERY. How else does anyone answer this? Donna Noble is\ngetting married again. The Tenth Doctor\u2019s trying to help. What could possibly\ngo wrong?\u201d \u00a0</p><h2><i>\u201cSo often\nthese things are a tearing hurry, but this was a nice sense of it sitting on a\nshelf, gently maturing.

He created both the Tenth Doctor and\nDonna, and in his role on TV, he oversaw every single word which came out of\ntheir mouths. </p><p>In an exclusive interview with this magazine, Vortex asked\nhim how odd does it feel, that a part of his time on <b>Doctor Who</b> is now being brought to life on audio by Big Finish? </p><p>He says: \u201cActually, yes, good question, because odd is the\nright word. Along with wonderful and exciting and brilliant. But I pored over\nevery single word the Doctor and Donna ever said to each other \u2013 apart from\nSteven Moffat\u2019s two-parter, I probably wrote most of their dialogue \u2013 so to not\nknow what they\u2019re going to say next is a little bit strange. Just a little bit!\nIn a good way. But really, I can\u2019t wait to hear those two actors riff off each\nother again. David and Catherine are such good friends in real life, there\u2019s a\ngenuine spark between the Doctor and Donna.\u201d </p><p>Russell wasn\u2019t involved with the storylines? </p><p>\u201cNot at all!\u201d, he says. \u201cWell, they ran them past me in\nsimple synopses, but it\u2019s Big Finish, they know what they\u2019re doing. And\nbesides, you can\u2019t make these things with someone sitting far away, trying to\nmeddle. It\u2019s a Big Finish licence, so it\u2019s a Big Finish show, it\u2019s their\nversion of the Doctor and Donna. And that\u2019s Big Finish\u2019s speciality \u2013\nrecreating eras faithfully but always finding something new to say.\u201d </p><p>And how excited is he to hear some new stories, being brought\nto life by David and Catherine? </p><p>\u201cVery! Those two, back in action, after all these years,\nit\u2019s an absolute joy. Just the other day, I was in Superdrug, and the woman at\nthe till asked if I wanted a bag, and I said no, I\u2019ll put it in my pocket, and\nshe sighed wistfully and said, \u2018Women don\u2019t have pockets.\u2019 And it made me think\nof Donna! I laughed to myself for about 10 minutes afterwards, remembering\nDonna\u2019s line about getting her wedding dress from Chez Alison. It made me think\nhow much I miss her. And bang on cue, here she is, back again! And I don\u2019t\nthink a single day passes without someone telling me how much they loved David\nas the Doctor. It\u2019s an honour to get him and Catherine back together. Yes, I\u2019m\nexcited!\u201d</p><h2><i>\u201cThose two,\nback in action, after all these years, it\u2019s an absolute joy.\u201d</i></h2><p><i>\u2013 Russell T Davies</i></p><p><br></p><h2><b>\u2013 VORTEX Magazine, Issue 87, Pages 6-15</b></h2><p><br></p><p><b>The Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 01\u00a0</b></p><p>Technophobia<br></p><blockquote><p>London\u2019s Technology Museum faces a revolution.

We had lots of exchanges of ideas,\nback and forth. </p><p>\u201cJames is a good, solid, clever writer who you know you can\nrely on. I was really pleased to get Jenny involved as we were keen to have\nsomething of a name attached to the series, and she is such a good writer who\nloves her <b>Doctor Who</b> too. It\u2019s great\nto have a Sunday Times best-selling writer with us!\u201d </p><p>In order for Matt to get the feel for the era again, he had\nto dig out his DVD collection.</p><p>In Technophobia, the Doctor and Donna visit London\u2019s\nTechnology Museum for a glimpse into the future, but things don\u2019t go to plan.\nThe most brilliant IT brain in the country can\u2019t use her computer.

Is it all down to\nsimple human stupidity, or is something more sinister going on? Beneath the\nstreets, the Koggnossenti are waiting. For all of London to fall prey to\ntechnophobia\u2026 </p><p>Smiling, Matt says: \u201cIt was a question of going back and\nwatching the episodes again, which is what I do with the classic series. You\nwatch the episodes and how the characters work \u2013 the Doctor and Donna are just\nsuch vivid characters, as they are so full of life on screen. </p><p>\u201cI suppose there\u2019s an added pressure knowing you\u2019ve got\nDavid and Catherine performing your lines. Everyone knows Catherine\u2019s a brilliant\ncomedian and some people forget just how great an actress she is too \u2013 you want\nto give her something to really work with. </p><p>\u201cYou know David\u2019s so good and will be able to do anything\nyou give to him.\u201d </p><p>David Richardson says: \u201c<i>Technophobia</i>\nbegan life as something else altogether. I\u2019d been holding on to the idea for a\nstory about sleep deprivation \u2013 what would happen if the whole world lost the\nability to sleep? That was going to be our first episode. And then we submitted\nit to Cardiff, and of course <i>Sleep No\nMore</i> was planned for series nine on television, so there was a clash. Matt\nFitton rather brilliantly took the core idea and twisted it into something else\nentirely different but really clever.\u201d</p><h2><i>\u201cEveryone\nknows Catherine\u2019s a brilliant comedian, and some people forget just how great\nan actress she is too \u2013 you want to give her something to really work with.\u201d</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 Matt Fitton</i></p></blockquote><h2><b>Time Reaver</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"790\" data-orig-height=\"1184\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32815d233db6acd50e561a04a90084ac/tumblr_inline_ppuv2o6sG81rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"790\" data-orig-height=\"1184\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Jenny T Colgan wearing an \u201cI \u2018heart\nheart\u2019 Gallifrey\u201d t-shirt.<b>]</b></i><br></p></blockquote><p>The second adventure for the Doctor and Donna is Time\nReaver.

David and Catherine are such good friends in real life, there&rsquo;s a\ngenuine spark between the Doctor and Donna.&rdquo; </p><p>Russell wasn&rsquo;t involved with the storylines? </p><p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;Well, they ran them past me in\nsimple synopses, but it&rsquo;s Big Finish, they know what they&rsquo;re doing. And\nbesides, you can&rsquo;t make these things with someone sitting far away, trying to\nmeddle. It&rsquo;s a Big Finish licence, so it&rsquo;s a Big Finish show, it&rsquo;s their\nversion of the Doctor and Donna. And that&rsquo;s Big Finish&rsquo;s speciality &ndash;\nrecreating eras faithfully but always finding something new to say.&rdquo; </p><p>And how excited is he to hear some new stories, being brought\nto life by David and Catherine? </p><p>&ldquo;Very! Those two, back in action, after all these years,\nit&rsquo;s an absolute joy. Just the other day, I was in Superdrug, and the woman at\nthe till asked if I wanted a bag, and I said no, I&rsquo;ll put it in my pocket, and\nshe sighed wistfully and said, &lsquo;Women don&rsquo;t have pockets.&rsquo; And it made me think\nof Donna! I laughed to myself for about 10 minutes afterwards, remembering\nDonna&rsquo;s line about getting her wedding dress from Chez Alison. It made me think\nhow much I miss her. And bang on cue, here she is, back again! And I don&rsquo;t\nthink a single day passes without someone telling me how much they loved David\nas the Doctor. It&rsquo;s an honour to get him and Catherine back together. Yes, I&rsquo;m\nexcited!&rdquo;</p><h2><i>&ldquo;Those two,\nback in action, after all these years, it&rsquo;s an absolute joy.&rdquo;</i></h2><p><i>&ndash; Russell T Davies</i></p><p><br /></p><h2><b>&ndash; VORTEX Magazine, Issue 87, Pages 6-15</b></h2><p><br /></p><p><b>The Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 01&nbsp;</b></p><p>Technophobia<br /></p><blockquote><p>London&rsquo;s Technology Museum faces a revolution.

He\nactually, light-heartedly, encouraged me to go out and get the licence. At one\nstage, Michael Stevens and I had plans for Big Finish and Audiogo to do a\ncoproduction of audio drama featuring the Tenth Doctor. But David\u2019s schedule\nand Audiogo\u2019s demise meant that plan didn\u2019t materialise. But when we finally\ngot the licence, I did chat to David on the phone. He eventually came up with\nthe idea of a special, three-CD release.\u201d </p><p>Line producer David Richardson adds: \u201cThe pitch for the Big\nFinish/ AudioGO co-production still exists \u2013 although none of the stories made\nit into this collection. The plan back then was to have episodes with a running\ntheme, one that would climax with a big reveal and the return of a character\nfrom the Tenth Doctor era \u2013 but when we came to do this set of the Doctor and\nDonna stories, it was felt that it was best to go down the route of individual,\nunconnected episodes.\u201d </p><p>But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves a little. </p><p>This month sees the eagerly anticipated return of David,\nalongside Catherine Tate as everyone\u2019s favourite temp from Chiswick, Donna\nNoble.</p><p>However, the process of getting them back together hasn\u2019t\nbeen an easy one. </p><p>Big Finish executive producer and company chairman Jason\nHaigh-Ellery says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of support in getting series based around\nthe New Legacy Doctors. When the time was right, the BBC gave us the rights and\nhelped us to get these productions up and running as soon as possible. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really pleased to have got David and Catherine back\ntogether.</p><p><i><br/></i></p><h2><i>\u201cI first\ndid Big Finish with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred many years ago, certainly\nbefore Doctor Who was as central a part of my life as it has become since.\u201d</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 David Tennant</i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSomeone said to me, \u2018Why did you announce John Hurt and\nDavid Tennant just a few weeks apart?\u2019 The thing is, it took about two weeks to\nsort John out and get him into studio. With David and Catherine, it took a year\n\u2013 and you don\u2019t want to announce anything until you have it recorded. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t in any way planned to announce them as closely\ntogether as we did, it just took us a year to sort out dates when we could get\nDavid and Catherine in studio together again. </p><p>\u201cIt was very important to both of them that they were there,\nacting together, so they could get that old feeling going again. </p><p>\u201cA lot of people have said that David and Catherine\u2019s\nrelationship on-screen was some of the best stuff in 21st century Doctor Who,\nas a favourite combination of Doctor and companion. Seeing them work together,\nyou can tell it\u2019s obvious the two of them love working together and enjoy it. </p><p>\u201cIt was well worth waiting a year for, to have them\ntogether.\u201d </p><p>Nick continues: \u201cOnce the BBC accepted the proposal, David\nRichardson and script editor Matt Fitton started working on story ideas, and\nkept me informed all along the way. It looked like we might get David and\nCatherine into studio fairly imminently then, so the scripts were worked on\nquite quickly. Then, when they were ready and tentative studio bookings made,\nDavid and Catherine \u2013 very busy people! \u2013 suddenly became unavailable. So we\nhad to wait quite a while. So it\u2019s true to say those scripts were then waiting\nfor the final bookings to be made. So that\u2019s why, when the information was\nleaked on the internet, we couldn\u2019t comment, because we weren\u2019t one hundred per\ncent sure it was actually going to happen. We had everything crossed! </p><p>David Richardson adds: \u201cWe certainly began story lining back\nin the summer of 2014, and the scripts were all signed off by May 2015. So they\nsat on the shelf for several months before we were able to get David and\nCatherine together in October.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"448\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9be1cf86727e16657c4aeea074d7fa3/tumblr_inline_ppush2gjth1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"448\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> David Tennant and Catherine Tate.<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>When it was revealed in October last year that David Tennant\nwas to play the Doctor for Big Finish, it marked his return to the Moat Studios\nafter an absence of a decade.<br/></p><p>Speaking to producer David Richardson, David Tennant\nrecalls: \u201cI first did Big Finish with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred many\nyears ago, certainly before Doctor Who was as central a part of my life as it\nhas become since. </p><p>\u201cI was always keen to come and play. I did a few different\ncharacters, one with Colin Baker, one with David Warner and some Dalek stuff\nwith Nick Briggs. It was always something I really enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lovely little job when it came along, so it\u2019s nice\nto return to that because doing audio stuff is always really good fun. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an immediacy to it \u2013 you turn up and haven\u2019t\nlearned the lines \u2013 you prepare a little but basically you are flying by the\nseat of your pants, to a certain extent, and if you have got lots of good\nactors who inspire you and make it good fun, it\u2019s really not a bad way to spend\na day. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite tiring and it\u2019s quite intensive because you do a\nstory in a day, faster than you work on Radio 4, but there\u2019s such an energy to\nthis stuff, you can\u2019t help but be barrelled along by it. It took about two\nweeks to do a show on TV!\u201d </p><p>Jason Haigh-Ellery was particularly delighted to welcome\nDavid back into the Big Finish family. </p><p>He says: \u201cYou know what, it didn\u2019t feel like David had been\naway for a decade. That\u2019s just unbelievable. When David came back it felt he\u2019d\nonly been away for a year or so, it really didn\u2019t feel like it had been 10\nyears. </p><p>\u201cAs ever, David was lovely to everybody, and he slotted\nright back in. \u201cDavid has an amazing memory and he remembers everyone\u2019s name.\nHe just walked in and went around, saying hello to everybody. He was wonderful.\n</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great having him back, and I hope we will do more with\nhim.\u201d </p><p>Being back as the Doctor has been a joy for David, but he\nadmits it was a bit of a worry to start with. </p><p>He says: \u201cIt\u2019s been really good fun. I was a bit nervous\nabout whether I would slip into it with ease, or would it be a bit of a\nstretch, but it really felt like returning to a comfy pair of trousers, rather\nthan a scratchy vest. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all quite high energy, the character, but once you key\ninto it, it always makes sense. </p><p>\u201cThat was always the key to it, it was very tiring to do,\nbut they\u2019ve also been invigorating. It has its own momentum, I think. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d always used the script as my springboard, really, from\nwhat Russell T Davies and the other writers wrote and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve\ncontinued to do here. You take what\u2019s on the page and use it as your starting\npoint. </p><p>\u201cIf you come at a character like this with pre-conceived\nnotions, that you might play him like this or that, the danger is you can be\nfighting the actual story and the script \u2013 the whole thing has got to evolve as\none piece.\u201d </p><p>David was particularly pleased to be reunited with Catherine\nTate \u2013 with whom he has also worked on Comic Relief, Much Ado About Nothing and\nNever Mind The Buzzcocks and the recent Shakespeare Live \u2013 as they have a firm\nestablished friendship. </p><p>He says: \u201cI think Catherine and I always got on, right from\nthe moment she came to do the tiny bit at the end of Doomsday. She came down\nand shot the cliffhanger for series two. It took all of half-an-hour and from\nthat moment, we got on \u2013 and always have done. That\u2019s something we can\nhopefully bring to the characters. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked together in various places and in various ways\nand it\u2019s something we enjoy doing. It\u2019s just always nice to see her and it\u2019s\nnice to play.\u201d</p><p><i><br/></i></p><h2><i>\u201cI think\nCatherine and I always got on, right from the moment she came to do the tiny\nbit at the end of <b>Doomsday</b>.\u201d</i></h2><blockquote><p><i> \u2013 David Tennant</i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>For the Big Finish production team, there was a huge sense\nof relief when they finally got their leading man and woman into studio after\nmonths of planning.<br/></p><p>Nick says: \u201cThere was a great sense of occasion. And it was\nwonderful to hear David and Catherine working together. I actually thought\nCatherine\u2019s performance was slightly different to her performance on TV. She\nseemed far more restrained than I expected her to be. </p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s a very shrewd actress, and she knew just how to\npitch it when acting so close to a microphone.</p><p><br/></p><h2><i>\u201cThe camaraderie\nexisted the moment people arrived at the studio, that people were familiar with\neach other.\u201d </i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 David Richardson</i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-height=\"202\" data-orig-width=\"249\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3bd8c2b6cc9e4fcea5629188855014bb/tumblr_inline_ppusl5bqp21rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"202\" data-orig-width=\"249\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Left to right:\nBeth Chalmers, Blake Ritson, Alice Krige, and Alan Cox<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI think what she\u2019s done for us is rather beautiful and\noften very moving in all sorts of unexpected ways. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve run out of words to describe how brilliant David is.\nHe\u2019s a lovely chap. Very easygoing and fun to work with and\u2026 well, he just\ndelivers! It\u2019s such a joy to behold.\u201d </p><p>David Richardson adds: \u201cIn the months running up to the\nrecording, I\u2019d got myself in a terrible state of stress. \u201cIt was clear every\nstep of the way how momentous these episodes would be, and I felt the pressure\nthat they had to be as good as they possibly could be, and that David and\nCatherine should have as great a time as they possibly could recording it. </p><p>\u201cOf course, I needn\u2019t have worried. For two huge,\ninternational stars they are very laid back and approachable people. It was\nlovely to sit and chat with David in the green room, and to hear him say he had\nbought our <b>Blake\u2019s 7</b> audios and\nenjoyed them! </p><p>\u201cNick let me cast all the plays, and I was very careful to\nhire people that we knew were accomplished actors and fun to be around, but\nalso to have some people who David and Catherine would know and feel\ncomfortable working with. So it was great to have Niky Wardley, who was one of\nthe mainstays of <b>The Catherine Tate Show</b>.\nAlex Lowe and Alan Cox knew both David and Catherine. Dan Starkey had worked\nwith them on the TV series\u2026 It meant the cameraderie existed the moment people\narrived at the studio, that people were familiar with each other. </p><p>\u201cOh, and I cast Alice Krige because she really is one of my\nfavourite actors, and one of my favourite people to be with at the studio. I\u2019ve\nworked with Alice three times now, and we just sit and have the most extraordinary\nconversations about life. She\u2019s wonderful.\u201d </p><p>The pair found there to be so many highlights over the three\nstudio days. </p><p>Nick pauses, before saying: \u201cThere are so many. But I think\nmy personal highlight was when Catherine found so many poignant moments in\nDeath and The Queen. I had, rather unfairly, pigeon-holed it as pure knockabout\ncomedy. But Catherine saw past that and at one point brought a tear to my eye.\u201d\n</p><p>David admits: \u201cThe moment I\u2019ll always remember is recording\nthe very first scene. David and Catherine threw themselves into it like they\u2019d\nnever been away. I was in the control room, and Matt Fitton was sitting on the\nsofa and we just turned to each other and grinned the biggest grins\u2026 I love all\nthree scripts \u2013 <i>Technophobia</i> is just\nright for a Tenth Doctor opening story. <i>Time\nReaver</i> is wildly imaginative but also quite personal and dramatic too. And <i>Death and the Queen</i> is bonkers and\ntouching and brilliant.\u201d </p><p>David Tennant adds: \u201cI think the three scripts, like the TV\nshow, are very individual in themselves. </p><p>\u201cThey are very different types of stories and they each had\nquite unique concepts to them, whether it\u2019s the tone or the entire story. </p><p>\u201cThe first one is a much more recognisable world, with the\nconceit of it. You expect it to be one type of story but it\u2019s another. It\u2019s\nvery clever. I think the third is quite an unusual world. Like the TV show at\nits best, they are fun, new ways of telling the same type of stories.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e1382f29a89a1713f59a03d4a366b48/tumblr_inline_ppuszmL87N1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover for\u00a0\u201cTechnophobia\u201d by Matt Fitton, featuring a banner that reads\u00a0\u201cBBC Doctor Who - David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Technophobia by Matt Fitton, featuring Rachael Stirling and Niky Wardley\u201d, and a photo of David Tennant.

David and Catherine were\nthere at the very start of my \u2018professional\u2019 Doctor Who career, when I joined\nthem in series four for <i>The Sontaran Stratagem</i>\nand <i>The Poison Sky</i>, so it was nice to\ncome back to them again, now Big Finish are doing new series <b>Who</b>. </p><p>\u201cMost actors enjoy radio because it\u2019s just good fun. We get\nthe work done, and we can have a laugh with it. It\u2019s always good being in the\ngreen room at the Moat then having a great lunch \u2013 and with David and Catherine\naround, it was great fun. You can tell they really get on. </p><p>\u201cI very much enjoyed that period of the show, with the Tenth\nDoctor and Donna. It\u2019s very strange now, thinking back to how much time has\npassed since then. </p><p>\u201cI loved the way the Doctor and Donna were just great mates,\ngoing around, solving problems, and at that point, it felt like <b>Doctor Who</b> was really back and had\ntaken over television. It was a great time to be involved in it and get on the\nbandwagon! </p><p>\u201cNot having to sit in the make-up chair for three hours is\nsomething I always appreciate! </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great script by Jenny Colgan, that really captures\nthat breathless rush that was there in the series four stories. You can really\npicture the bright colours, and there\u2019s lots of pathos as well. It\u2019s got that\ntension, which is really familiar as well.\u201d </p><p>Another guest star in <i>Time\nReaver</i> is another man who has spent most of his TV <b>Doctor Who</b> career behind a mask. Terry Molloy plays Rone in this\nstory, but is best remembered for playing Davros against Peter Davison, Colin\nBaker and Sylvester McCoy\u2019s Time Lords. </p><p>Terry recalls: \u201cIt was lovely to be at the microphone with\nDavid again, as we had previously worked together back in the 90s on a radio\nversion of Edward Bond\u2019s play <b>The Sea</b>.\nIn <i>Time Reaver</i>, the studio fizzed\nwith the energy and pace he always brings to the Doctor, and of course the\ninterplay between him and Catherine Tate was fast, furious and very funny!\u201d </p><h2><i>\u201cIt was a\ngreat day.

It\u2019s got some slightly deconstructed elements which make it\nthe most broadly funny, the most broadly comic, of the three. That always works\nfor the Doctor and Donna as a pairing. </p><p>\u201cIt also goes to some quite dark, quite unusual places and\nyou also get to see Donna at her best. She struggles with finally getting her\nfairytale wedding, and nothing quite works out as she would imagine.\u201d </p><p>Joining the guest cast is Beth Chalmers as Hortense. </p><p>She grins: \u201cI\u2019ve now worked with every single one of the Big\nFinish Doctors \u2013 I\u2019ve worked with the others to a greater or lesser degree over\nthe years, and in the last year, I\u2019ve now added John Hurt and David Tennant \u2013\nwhich is pretty cool. </p><p>\u201cIt was a bit cloak and dagger being in this one, as I was\nonly told about it a couple of weeks before we went into the studio. I think I\nwas doing one of the John Hurt episodes, when David Richardson asked me what I\nhad coming up, and I asked him, \u2018Why?\u2019 He told me it was something they were\nkeeping very, very quiet and told me it was these two, David and Catherine. </p><p>\u201cCatherine Tate is a real treat to work with, but David\nTennant is just so classy \u2013 he\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s fantastic to work with great\nactors and he\u2019s such a brilliant guy too. I\u2019ve worked with his wife Georgia\nbefore and you hear such lovely things about him from other people who have\nworked with him \u2013 and it\u2019s all true. David\u2019s got a kind of left-field, zany\nmadness to him \u2013 he\u2019s brilliant. </p><p>\u201cI was really thrilled and knew there weren\u2019t that many\nbeing made, so it was amazing to be one of the few actors to be asked.\u201d </p><p>Beth found herself having to work hard on her character.\n\u201cThis story is a bit like a period drama, with a medieval castle. I did most of\nmy scenes with Catherine Tate, who was speaking in her modern way with her modern\nrhythms, but I had to use a period voice. It\u2019s hard to keep that going when she\u2019s\nbeing funny, quippy, cool and modern, while I had to stick with the medieval\nvoice. </p><p>\u201cBut when you compare the two voices, it makes her even more\nfunny. </p><p>\u201cIt was a great story to do \u2013 it was fun, and almost\ncartoony, but I don\u2019t mean that in any way to sound disrespectful. </p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t too many vortexes and galaxies to worry\nabout, so I could understand it! </p><p>\u201cI also loved working with Blake Ritson \u2013 I was bowled over\nwhen I heard him doing his stuff. </p><p>\u201cIt was a great day, and it felt really special in the\nstudio. I\u2019m really looking forward to hearing how it all sounds in the finished\nversion.\u201d </p><p>Responsible for the music and sound design on the trio of\ntales is Howard Carter. </p><p>Having worked on the War Doctor box sets, The Diary of River\nSong and UNIT, he\u2019s loving the chance to get the Tenth Doctor onto his CV. </p><p>When first asked to work on this series, Howard admits he\nwas: \u201cVery excited! I\u2019ve been working on the new series releases for the past\nseven months and knew these were coming up so it\u2019s great to finally get stuck\nin. I read all of the scripts in one sitting and was thrilled at how brilliant\nthey were and how much scope there was for me to be creative with the sound\ndesign and the music.\u201d </p><p>How did he approach the plays \u2013 did he try to evoke Murray\nGold\u2019s style, as well as doing his own? </p><p>Howard explains: \u201cWith the Big Finish audios I\u2019ve always\nfelt that we should be moving the world of Doctor Who forward rather than\ncreating pastiches of what\u2019s been before. While it\u2019s important to retain a\ncertain level of stylistic familiarity I was keen to make sure the musical\nlanguage was fresh and not too restricted by Murray\u2019s style. His sound has been\nso integral to the characterisation and general atmosphere of the show that it\nwould be foolish to ignore, but at the same time I feel the plays are best\nserved by taking a step forward. </p><p>\u201cAs such, I wanted to create a score that wouldn\u2019t sound out\nof place in the world that people are familiar with, while letting my own\ninfluences and style filter through. The music is still very thematic with\ncertain motifs running through the boxset, but my main aim was to write scores\nthat best serve these plays and the overall atmosphere of the set.\u201d </p><p>He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to be working on these\nstories. The scripts are so fantastic it\u2019s both humbling and exciting to be\nbringing them to life knowing that so many people will get the chance to hear\nthe Doctor and Donna back together. I can only hope people have as much fun\nlistening to them as much as I\u2019ve had working on them.\u201d </p><p>The final element that really seals the deal for these\naudios are the covers, which have been created by Tom Webster. </p><p>As with the rest of the Big Finish team, Tom was delighted\nto be working on these releases. </p><p>He adds: \u201cI was so excited to work with the David and\nCatherine images. I think the moment where I started to cut the images out was\nwhere it really hit me, the Tenth Doctor and Donna in Big Finish. Amazing! </p><p>\u201cI found it quite easy to create a feel for the era on the\nspecial deluxe edition, I set out to emulate the style of the series box sets\nand particularly the vanilla DVDs. I wanted to go with very bright, vibrant\ncolours and the most dynamic photos that I could use. </p><p>\u201cI decided from an early stage that I wanted to play with a\nTARDIS interior motif - so I created something inspired by the coral\nstructures, which provided a nice framework. The vanilla covers were lots of\nfun, as I was tasked with making each one distinctly different. Technophobia\nreally feels like a Russell T Davies episode one, so I really wanted to go for\na bright and brash impactful image. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually extremely happy with them all, I spent lots of\ntime getting them just the way I\u2019d imagined when reading the scripts. I\u2019m so\ngrateful for the opportunity to be doing such huge releases for Big Finish and\nI didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. I hope people enjoy them!\u201d </p><p>Since the Big Finish Tenth Doctor audios were first\nannounced, they have received plenty of coverage in the media, from\npublications as diverse as Jenny Colgan\u2019s local newspaper the Ayrshire Post, to\nnational papers like the Daily Mirror, whilst they\u2019ve also had numerous\nmentions on TV, including a big plug on <b>The\nJonathan Ross Show</b> on ITV. </p><p>David Richardson says: \u201cWe knew the reaction was going to be\nhuge. And it was probably bigger than that! So it was brilliant, and such a\nrelief to have the secret out there having kept it to ourselves for so long.\nWe\u2019d had a year of whispering in locked rooms and sending coded emails \u2013 and\nsuddenly all the world knew!\u201d </p><p>Nick adds: \u201cCan I just say too how delighted I was? It was\none of those things. We\u2019d been living with these plays for so long. It seemed\nalmost surreal that we were actually doing them. And when our listeners and\nother <b>Doctor Who</b> fans loved the idea\ntoo\u2026 It was simply amazing.\u201d </p><p>Jason was particularly pleased that Big Finish received so\nmany mentions when David was doing the media rounds to promote his Netflix\nseries <b>Jessica Jones</b>. </p><p>He laughs: \u201cI feel like sending the publicist for <b>Jessica Jones</b> a bunch of roses! </p><p>\u201cThey did a great job to get David on a lot of programmes to\ntalk about <b>Jessica Jones</b>, and we\nkind of hijacked their promotional tour! </p><p>\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve done over the years, that\ndefinitely got us the most media attention. </p><p>\u201cDavid, I\u2019m sure, knows how much he was loved as <b>Doctor Who</b>. If he ever had any doubts,\nI think going round and doing publicity for <b>Jessica Jones</b>, where everyone asked him about doing the Big Finish\naudios, has shown how much people are still interested in him and love him as\nthe Doctor.\u201d</p><h2><b>\u2013 VORTEX Magazine, Issue 87, Pages 6-15</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9cbcd5f3ab49e5de6d4c711fdfb847ce/tumblr_inline_ppuu95heaG1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover of \u201cThe Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 1\u2033. <br/><b>Text reads:</b> \u201cDavid Tennant - Catherine Tate<br/>BBC Doctor Who<br/>The Tenth Doctor Adventures<br/>Three Full Cast Audio Adventures<br/>Technophobia - Time Reaver - Death And The Queen\u201d<br/></i><i><b>Background</b> features the Big Finish logo, Catherine Tate, David Tennant, the TARDIS, Time Reaver\u2019s antagonist, Gully, a black hooded figure, and a castle.<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><b>The Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 01</b></p><p>Technophobia<br/></p><blockquote><p>London\u2019s Technology Museum faces a revolution.

He\nactually, light-heartedly, encouraged me to go out and get the licence. At one\nstage, Michael Stevens and I had plans for Big Finish and Audiogo to do a\ncoproduction of audio drama featuring the Tenth Doctor. But David\u2019s schedule\nand Audiogo\u2019s demise meant that plan didn\u2019t materialise. But when we finally\ngot the licence, I did chat to David on the phone. He eventually came up with\nthe idea of a special, three-CD release.\u201d </p><p>Line producer David Richardson adds: \u201cThe pitch for the Big\nFinish/ AudioGO co-production still exists \u2013 although none of the stories made\nit into this collection. The plan back then was to have episodes with a running\ntheme, one that would climax with a big reveal and the return of a character\nfrom the Tenth Doctor era \u2013 but when we came to do this set of the Doctor and\nDonna stories, it was felt that it was best to go down the route of individual,\nunconnected episodes.\u201d </p><p>But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves a little. </p><p>This month sees the eagerly anticipated return of David,\nalongside Catherine Tate as everyone\u2019s favourite temp from Chiswick, Donna\nNoble.</p><p>However, the process of getting them back together hasn\u2019t\nbeen an easy one. </p><p>Big Finish executive producer and company chairman Jason\nHaigh-Ellery says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of support in getting series based around\nthe New Legacy Doctors. When the time was right, the BBC gave us the rights and\nhelped us to get these productions up and running as soon as possible. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really pleased to have got David and Catherine back\ntogether.</p><p><i><br></i></p><h2><i>\u201cI first\ndid Big Finish with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred many years ago, certainly\nbefore Doctor Who was as central a part of my life as it has become since.\u201d</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 David Tennant</i></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>\u201cSomeone said to me, \u2018Why did you announce John Hurt and\nDavid Tennant just a few weeks apart?\u2019 The thing is, it took about two weeks to\nsort John out and get him into studio. With David and Catherine, it took a year\n\u2013 and you don\u2019t want to announce anything until you have it recorded. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t in any way planned to announce them as closely\ntogether as we did, it just took us a year to sort out dates when we could get\nDavid and Catherine in studio together again. </p><p>\u201cIt was very important to both of them that they were there,\nacting together, so they could get that old feeling going again. </p><p>\u201cA lot of people have said that David and Catherine\u2019s\nrelationship on-screen was some of the best stuff in 21st century Doctor Who,\nas a favourite combination of Doctor and companion. Seeing them work together,\nyou can tell it\u2019s obvious the two of them love working together and enjoy it. </p><p>\u201cIt was well worth waiting a year for, to have them\ntogether.\u201d </p><p>Nick continues: \u201cOnce the BBC accepted the proposal, David\nRichardson and script editor Matt Fitton started working on story ideas, and\nkept me informed all along the way. It looked like we might get David and\nCatherine into studio fairly imminently then, so the scripts were worked on\nquite quickly. Then, when they were ready and tentative studio bookings made,\nDavid and Catherine \u2013 very busy people! \u2013 suddenly became unavailable. So we\nhad to wait quite a while. So it\u2019s true to say those scripts were then waiting\nfor the final bookings to be made. So that\u2019s why, when the information was\nleaked on the internet, we couldn\u2019t comment, because we weren\u2019t one hundred per\ncent sure it was actually going to happen. We had everything crossed! </p><p>David Richardson adds: \u201cWe certainly began story lining back\nin the summer of 2014, and the scripts were all signed off by May 2015. So they\nsat on the shelf for several months before we were able to get David and\nCatherine together in October.\u201d </p><p><br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"448\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9be1cf86727e16657c4aeea074d7fa3/tumblr_inline_ppush2gjth1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"448\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> David Tennant and Catherine Tate.<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>When it was revealed in October last year that David Tennant\nwas to play the Doctor for Big Finish, it marked his return to the Moat Studios\nafter an absence of a decade.<br></p><p>Speaking to producer David Richardson, David Tennant\nrecalls: \u201cI first did Big Finish with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred many\nyears ago, certainly before Doctor Who was as central a part of my life as it\nhas become since. </p><p>\u201cI was always keen to come and play. I did a few different\ncharacters, one with Colin Baker, one with David Warner and some Dalek stuff\nwith Nick Briggs. It was always something I really enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lovely little job when it came along, so it\u2019s nice\nto return to that because doing audio stuff is always really good fun. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an immediacy to it \u2013 you turn up and haven\u2019t\nlearned the lines \u2013 you prepare a little but basically you are flying by the\nseat of your pants, to a certain extent, and if you have got lots of good\nactors who inspire you and make it good fun, it\u2019s really not a bad way to spend\na day. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite tiring and it\u2019s quite intensive because you do a\nstory in a day, faster than you work on Radio 4, but there\u2019s such an energy to\nthis stuff, you can\u2019t help but be barrelled along by it. It took about two\nweeks to do a show on TV!\u201d </p><p>Jason Haigh-Ellery was particularly delighted to welcome\nDavid back into the Big Finish family. </p><p>He says: \u201cYou know what, it didn\u2019t feel like David had been\naway for a decade. That\u2019s just unbelievable. When David came back it felt he\u2019d\nonly been away for a year or so, it really didn\u2019t feel like it had been 10\nyears. </p><p>\u201cAs ever, David was lovely to everybody, and he slotted\nright back in. \u201cDavid has an amazing memory and he remembers everyone\u2019s name.\nHe just walked in and went around, saying hello to everybody. He was wonderful.\n</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great having him back, and I hope we will do more with\nhim.\u201d </p><p>Being back as the Doctor has been a joy for David, but he\nadmits it was a bit of a worry to start with. </p><p>He says: \u201cIt\u2019s been really good fun. I was a bit nervous\nabout whether I would slip into it with ease, or would it be a bit of a\nstretch, but it really felt like returning to a comfy pair of trousers, rather\nthan a scratchy vest. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all quite high energy, the character, but once you key\ninto it, it always makes sense. </p><p>\u201cThat was always the key to it, it was very tiring to do,\nbut they\u2019ve also been invigorating. It has its own momentum, I think. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d always used the script as my springboard, really, from\nwhat Russell T Davies and the other writers wrote and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve\ncontinued to do here. You take what\u2019s on the page and use it as your starting\npoint. </p><p>\u201cIf you come at a character like this with pre-conceived\nnotions, that you might play him like this or that, the danger is you can be\nfighting the actual story and the script \u2013 the whole thing has got to evolve as\none piece.\u201d </p><p>David was particularly pleased to be reunited with Catherine\nTate \u2013 with whom he has also worked on Comic Relief, Much Ado About Nothing and\nNever Mind The Buzzcocks and the recent Shakespeare Live \u2013 as they have a firm\nestablished friendship. </p><p>He says: \u201cI think Catherine and I always got on, right from\nthe moment she came to do the tiny bit at the end of Doomsday. She came down\nand shot the cliffhanger for series two. It took all of half-an-hour and from\nthat moment, we got on \u2013 and always have done. That\u2019s something we can\nhopefully bring to the characters. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked together in various places and in various ways\nand it\u2019s something we enjoy doing.

Very easygoing and fun to work with and\u2026 well, he just\ndelivers! It\u2019s such a joy to behold.\u201d </p><p>David Richardson adds: \u201cIn the months running up to the\nrecording, I\u2019d got myself in a terrible state of stress. \u201cIt was clear every\nstep of the way how momentous these episodes would be, and I felt the pressure\nthat they had to be as good as they possibly could be, and that David and\nCatherine should have as great a time as they possibly could recording it. </p><p>\u201cOf course, I needn\u2019t have worried. For two huge,\ninternational stars they are very laid back and approachable people. It was\nlovely to sit and chat with David in the green room, and to hear him say he had\nbought our <b>Blake\u2019s 7</b> audios and\nenjoyed them! </p><p>\u201cNick let me cast all the plays, and I was very careful to\nhire people that we knew were accomplished actors and fun to be around, but\nalso to have some people who David and Catherine would know and feel\ncomfortable working with. So it was great to have Niky Wardley, who was one of\nthe mainstays of <b>The Catherine Tate Show</b>.\nAlex Lowe and Alan Cox knew both David and Catherine. Dan Starkey had worked\nwith them on the TV series\u2026 It meant the cameraderie existed the moment people\narrived at the studio, that people were familiar with each other. </p><p>\u201cOh, and I cast Alice Krige because she really is one of my\nfavourite actors, and one of my favourite people to be with at the studio. I\u2019ve\nworked with Alice three times now, and we just sit and have the most extraordinary\nconversations about life. She\u2019s wonderful.\u201d </p><p>The pair found there to be so many highlights over the three\nstudio days. </p><p>Nick pauses, before saying: \u201cThere are so many. But I think\nmy personal highlight was when Catherine found so many poignant moments in\nDeath and The Queen. I had, rather unfairly, pigeon-holed it as pure knockabout\ncomedy. But Catherine saw past that and at one point brought a tear to my eye.\u201d\n</p><p>David admits: \u201cThe moment I\u2019ll always remember is recording\nthe very first scene. David and Catherine threw themselves into it like they\u2019d\nnever been away. I was in the control room, and Matt Fitton was sitting on the\nsofa and we just turned to each other and grinned the biggest grins\u2026 I love all\nthree scripts \u2013 <i>Technophobia</i> is just\nright for a Tenth Doctor opening story. <i>Time\nReaver</i> is wildly imaginative but also quite personal and dramatic too. And <i>Death and the Queen</i> is bonkers and\ntouching and brilliant.\u201d </p><p>David Tennant adds: \u201cI think the three scripts, like the TV\nshow, are very individual in themselves. </p><p>\u201cThey are very different types of stories and they each had\nquite unique concepts to them, whether it\u2019s the tone or the entire story. </p><p>\u201cThe first one is a much more recognisable world, with the\nconceit of it. You expect it to be one type of story but it\u2019s another. It\u2019s\nvery clever. I think the third is quite an unusual world. Like the TV show at\nits best, they are fun, new ways of telling the same type of stories.\u201d</p><p><br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e1382f29a89a1713f59a03d4a366b48/tumblr_inline_ppuszmL87N1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover for\u00a0\u201cTechnophobia\u201d by Matt Fitton, featuring a banner that reads\u00a0\u201cBBC Doctor Who - David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Technophobia by Matt Fitton, featuring Rachael Stirling and Niky Wardley\u201d, and a photo of David Tennant.

It\u2019s not an idea\nI\u2019ve come across in <b>Doctor Who</b>\nbefore.\u201d </p><p>Joining the cast is Niky Wardley playing Bex. Niky is no\nstranger to Big Finish, after appearing as the Eighth Doctor\u2019s companion Tamsin\nDrew. </p><p>She tells Vortex: \u201cWhat a treat to work with Catherine and\nDavid on Big Finish. David Richardson had asked me to be in it but I had no\nidea who else was in it until I saw the cast list a few days before so it was\nthe best surprise! </p><p>\u201cI was lucky enough to be recording with them on their first\nday, so to see them walk into their booths and then voice the Doctor and Donna\nagain, after such a hiatus, was incredible. </p><p>\u201cThey bounced back to life straight away such is their\namazing chemistry. David\u2019s energy as the Doctor is so affecting, he sweeps you\nalong with him and Catherine\u2019s genius with comedy makes it just the perfect\npartnership.

These days\nhe\u2019s best known to <b>Doctor Who</b> fans\nas Strax from the Paternoster Gang, alongside the Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors,\nbut he was delighted to work with the leading pair \u2013 for a very nostalgic\nreason. </p><p>He reveals: \u201cIt was a great day. David and Catherine were\nthere at the very start of my \u2018professional\u2019 Doctor Who career, when I joined\nthem in series four for <i>The Sontaran Stratagem</i>\nand <i>The Poison Sky</i>, so it was nice to\ncome back to them again, now Big Finish are doing new series <b>Who</b>. </p><p>\u201cMost actors enjoy radio because it\u2019s just good fun. We get\nthe work done, and we can have a laugh with it. It\u2019s always good being in the\ngreen room at the Moat then having a great lunch \u2013 and with David and Catherine\naround, it was great fun. You can tell they really get on. </p><p>\u201cI very much enjoyed that period of the show, with the Tenth\nDoctor and Donna. It\u2019s very strange now, thinking back to how much time has\npassed since then. </p><p>\u201cI loved the way the Doctor and Donna were just great mates,\ngoing around, solving problems, and at that point, it felt like <b>Doctor Who</b> was really back and had\ntaken over television. It was a great time to be involved in it and get on the\nbandwagon! </p><p>\u201cNot having to sit in the make-up chair for three hours is\nsomething I always appreciate! </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great script by Jenny Colgan, that really captures\nthat breathless rush that was there in the series four stories. You can really\npicture the bright colours, and there\u2019s lots of pathos as well. It\u2019s got that\ntension, which is really familiar as well.\u201d </p><p>Another guest star in <i>Time\nReaver</i> is another man who has spent most of his TV <b>Doctor Who</b> career behind a mask. Terry Molloy plays Rone in this\nstory, but is best remembered for playing Davros against Peter Davison, Colin\nBaker and Sylvester McCoy\u2019s Time Lords. </p><p>Terry recalls: \u201cIt was lovely to be at the microphone with\nDavid again, as we had previously worked together back in the 90s on a radio\nversion of Edward Bond\u2019s play <b>The Sea</b>.\nIn <i>Time Reaver</i>, the studio fizzed\nwith the energy and pace he always brings to the Doctor, and of course the\ninterplay between him and Catherine Tate was fast, furious and very funny!\u201d </p><h2><i>\u201cIt was a\ngreat day.

It\u2019s got some slightly deconstructed elements which make it\nthe most broadly funny, the most broadly comic, of the three. That always works\nfor the Doctor and Donna as a pairing. </p><p>\u201cIt also goes to some quite dark, quite unusual places and\nyou also get to see Donna at her best. She struggles with finally getting her\nfairytale wedding, and nothing quite works out as she would imagine.\u201d </p><p>Joining the guest cast is Beth Chalmers as Hortense. </p><p>She grins: \u201cI\u2019ve now worked with every single one of the Big\nFinish Doctors \u2013 I\u2019ve worked with the others to a greater or lesser degree over\nthe years, and in the last year, I\u2019ve now added John Hurt and David Tennant \u2013\nwhich is pretty cool. </p><p>\u201cIt was a bit cloak and dagger being in this one, as I was\nonly told about it a couple of weeks before we went into the studio. I think I\nwas doing one of the John Hurt episodes, when David Richardson asked me what I\nhad coming up, and I asked him, \u2018Why?\u2019 He told me it was something they were\nkeeping very, very quiet and told me it was these two, David and Catherine. </p><p>\u201cCatherine Tate is a real treat to work with, but David\nTennant is just so classy \u2013 he\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s fantastic to work with great\nactors and he\u2019s such a brilliant guy too. I\u2019ve worked with his wife Georgia\nbefore and you hear such lovely things about him from other people who have\nworked with him \u2013 and it\u2019s all true. David\u2019s got a kind of left-field, zany\nmadness to him \u2013 he\u2019s brilliant. </p><p>\u201cI was really thrilled and knew there weren\u2019t that many\nbeing made, so it was amazing to be one of the few actors to be asked.\u201d </p><p>Beth found herself having to work hard on her character.\n\u201cThis story is a bit like a period drama, with a medieval castle. I did most of\nmy scenes with Catherine Tate, who was speaking in her modern way with her modern\nrhythms, but I had to use a period voice. It\u2019s hard to keep that going when she\u2019s\nbeing funny, quippy, cool and modern, while I had to stick with the medieval\nvoice. </p><p>\u201cBut when you compare the two voices, it makes her even more\nfunny. </p><p>\u201cIt was a great story to do \u2013 it was fun, and almost\ncartoony, but I don\u2019t mean that in any way to sound disrespectful. </p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t too many vortexes and galaxies to worry\nabout, so I could understand it! </p><p>\u201cI also loved working with Blake Ritson \u2013 I was bowled over\nwhen I heard him doing his stuff. </p><p>\u201cIt was a great day, and it felt really special in the\nstudio. I\u2019m really looking forward to hearing how it all sounds in the finished\nversion.\u201d </p><p>Responsible for the music and sound design on the trio of\ntales is Howard Carter. </p><p>Having worked on the War Doctor box sets, The Diary of River\nSong and UNIT, he\u2019s loving the chance to get the Tenth Doctor onto his CV. </p><p>When first asked to work on this series, Howard admits he\nwas: \u201cVery excited! I\u2019ve been working on the new series releases for the past\nseven months and knew these were coming up so it\u2019s great to finally get stuck\nin. I read all of the scripts in one sitting and was thrilled at how brilliant\nthey were and how much scope there was for me to be creative with the sound\ndesign and the music.\u201d </p><p>How did he approach the plays \u2013 did he try to evoke Murray\nGold\u2019s style, as well as doing his own? </p><p>Howard explains: \u201cWith the Big Finish audios I\u2019ve always\nfelt that we should be moving the world of Doctor Who forward rather than\ncreating pastiches of what\u2019s been before. While it\u2019s important to retain a\ncertain level of stylistic familiarity I was keen to make sure the musical\nlanguage was fresh and not too restricted by Murray\u2019s style. His sound has been\nso integral to the characterisation and general atmosphere of the show that it\nwould be foolish to ignore, but at the same time I feel the plays are best\nserved by taking a step forward. </p><p>\u201cAs such, I wanted to create a score that wouldn\u2019t sound out\nof place in the world that people are familiar with, while letting my own\ninfluences and style filter through. The music is still very thematic with\ncertain motifs running through the boxset, but my main aim was to write scores\nthat best serve these plays and the overall atmosphere of the set.\u201d </p><p>He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to be working on these\nstories. The scripts are so fantastic it\u2019s both humbling and exciting to be\nbringing them to life knowing that so many people will get the chance to hear\nthe Doctor and Donna back together. I can only hope people have as much fun\nlistening to them as much as I\u2019ve had working on them.\u201d </p><p>The final element that really seals the deal for these\naudios are the covers, which have been created by Tom Webster. </p><p>As with the rest of the Big Finish team, Tom was delighted\nto be working on these releases. </p><p>He adds: \u201cI was so excited to work with the David and\nCatherine images. I think the moment where I started to cut the images out was\nwhere it really hit me, the Tenth Doctor and Donna in Big Finish. Amazing! </p><p>\u201cI found it quite easy to create a feel for the era on the\nspecial deluxe edition, I set out to emulate the style of the series box sets\nand particularly the vanilla DVDs. I wanted to go with very bright, vibrant\ncolours and the most dynamic photos that I could use. </p><p>\u201cI decided from an early stage that I wanted to play with a\nTARDIS interior motif - so I created something inspired by the coral\nstructures, which provided a nice framework. The vanilla covers were lots of\nfun, as I was tasked with making each one distinctly different. Technophobia\nreally feels like a Russell T Davies episode one, so I really wanted to go for\na bright and brash impactful image. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually extremely happy with them all, I spent lots of\ntime getting them just the way I\u2019d imagined when reading the scripts. I\u2019m so\ngrateful for the opportunity to be doing such huge releases for Big Finish and\nI didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. I hope people enjoy them!\u201d </p><p>Since the Big Finish Tenth Doctor audios were first\nannounced, they have received plenty of coverage in the media, from\npublications as diverse as Jenny Colgan\u2019s local newspaper the Ayrshire Post, to\nnational papers like the Daily Mirror, whilst they\u2019ve also had numerous\nmentions on TV, including a big plug on <b>The\nJonathan Ross Show</b> on ITV. </p><p>David Richardson says: \u201cWe knew the reaction was going to be\nhuge. And it was probably bigger than that! So it was brilliant, and such a\nrelief to have the secret out there having kept it to ourselves for so long.\nWe\u2019d had a year of whispering in locked rooms and sending coded emails \u2013 and\nsuddenly all the world knew!\u201d </p><p>Nick adds: \u201cCan I just say too how delighted I was? It was\none of those things. We\u2019d been living with these plays for so long. It seemed\nalmost surreal that we were actually doing them. And when our listeners and\nother <b>Doctor Who</b> fans loved the idea\ntoo\u2026 It was simply amazing.\u201d </p><p>Jason was particularly pleased that Big Finish received so\nmany mentions when David was doing the media rounds to promote his Netflix\nseries <b>Jessica Jones</b>. </p><p>He laughs: \u201cI feel like sending the publicist for <b>Jessica Jones</b> a bunch of roses! </p><p>\u201cThey did a great job to get David on a lot of programmes to\ntalk about <b>Jessica Jones</b>, and we\nkind of hijacked their promotional tour! </p><p>\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve done over the years, that\ndefinitely got us the most media attention. </p><p>\u201cDavid, I\u2019m sure, knows how much he was loved as <b>Doctor Who</b>. If he ever had any doubts,\nI think going round and doing publicity for <b>Jessica Jones</b>, where everyone asked him about doing the Big Finish\naudios, has shown how much people are still interested in him and love him as\nthe Doctor.\u201d</p><h2><b>\u2013 VORTEX Magazine, Issue 87, Pages 6-15</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9cbcd5f3ab49e5de6d4c711fdfb847ce/tumblr_inline_ppuu95heaG1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover of \u201cThe Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 1\u2033. <br><b>Text reads:</b> \u201cDavid Tennant - Catherine Tate<br>BBC Doctor Who<br>The Tenth Doctor Adventures<br>Three Full Cast Audio Adventures<br>Technophobia - Time Reaver - Death And The Queen\u201d<br></i><i><b>Background</b> features the Big Finish logo, Catherine Tate, David Tennant, the TARDIS, Time Reaver\u2019s antagonist, Gully, a black hooded figure, and a castle.<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><b>The Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 01</b></p><p>Technophobia<br></p><blockquote><p>London\u2019s Technology Museum faces a revolution.

He\nactually, light-heartedly, encouraged me to go out and get the licence. At one\nstage, Michael Stevens and I had plans for Big Finish and Audiogo to do a\ncoproduction of audio drama featuring the Tenth Doctor. But David\u2019s schedule\nand Audiogo\u2019s demise meant that plan didn\u2019t materialise. But when we finally\ngot the licence, I did chat to David on the phone. He eventually came up with\nthe idea of a special, three-CD release.\u201d </p><p>Line producer David Richardson adds: \u201cThe pitch for the Big\nFinish/ AudioGO co-production still exists \u2013 although none of the stories made\nit into this collection. The plan back then was to have episodes with a running\ntheme, one that would climax with a big reveal and the return of a character\nfrom the Tenth Doctor era \u2013 but when we came to do this set of the Doctor and\nDonna stories, it was felt that it was best to go down the route of individual,\nunconnected episodes.\u201d </p><p>But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves a little. </p><p>This month sees the eagerly anticipated return of David,\nalongside Catherine Tate as everyone\u2019s favourite temp from Chiswick, Donna\nNoble.</p><p>However, the process of getting them back together hasn\u2019t\nbeen an easy one. </p><p>Big Finish executive producer and company chairman Jason\nHaigh-Ellery says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of support in getting series based around\nthe New Legacy Doctors. When the time was right, the BBC gave us the rights and\nhelped us to get these productions up and running as soon as possible. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really pleased to have got David and Catherine back\ntogether.</p><p><i><br></i></p><h2><i>\u201cI first\ndid Big Finish with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred many years ago, certainly\nbefore Doctor Who was as central a part of my life as it has become since.\u201d</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 David Tennant</i></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>\u201cSomeone said to me, \u2018Why did you announce John Hurt and\nDavid Tennant just a few weeks apart?\u2019 The thing is, it took about two weeks to\nsort John out and get him into studio. With David and Catherine, it took a year\n\u2013 and you don\u2019t want to announce anything until you have it recorded. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t in any way planned to announce them as closely\ntogether as we did, it just took us a year to sort out dates when we could get\nDavid and Catherine in studio together again. </p><p>\u201cIt was very important to both of them that they were there,\nacting together, so they could get that old feeling going again. </p><p>\u201cA lot of people have said that David and Catherine\u2019s\nrelationship on-screen was some of the best stuff in 21st century Doctor Who,\nas a favourite combination of Doctor and companion. Seeing them work together,\nyou can tell it\u2019s obvious the two of them love working together and enjoy it. </p><p>\u201cIt was well worth waiting a year for, to have them\ntogether.\u201d </p><p>Nick continues: \u201cOnce the BBC accepted the proposal, David\nRichardson and script editor Matt Fitton started working on story ideas, and\nkept me informed all along the way. It looked like we might get David and\nCatherine into studio fairly imminently then, so the scripts were worked on\nquite quickly. Then, when they were ready and tentative studio bookings made,\nDavid and Catherine \u2013 very busy people! \u2013 suddenly became unavailable. So we\nhad to wait quite a while. So it\u2019s true to say those scripts were then waiting\nfor the final bookings to be made. So that\u2019s why, when the information was\nleaked on the internet, we couldn\u2019t comment, because we weren\u2019t one hundred per\ncent sure it was actually going to happen. We had everything crossed! </p><p>David Richardson adds: \u201cWe certainly began story lining back\nin the summer of 2014, and the scripts were all signed off by May 2015. So they\nsat on the shelf for several months before we were able to get David and\nCatherine together in October.\u201d </p><p><br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"448\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9be1cf86727e16657c4aeea074d7fa3/tumblr_inline_ppush2gjth1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"448\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> David Tennant and Catherine Tate.<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>When it was revealed in October last year that David Tennant\nwas to play the Doctor for Big Finish, it marked his return to the Moat Studios\nafter an absence of a decade.<br></p><p>Speaking to producer David Richardson, David Tennant\nrecalls: \u201cI first did Big Finish with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred many\nyears ago, certainly before Doctor Who was as central a part of my life as it\nhas become since. </p><p>\u201cI was always keen to come and play. I did a few different\ncharacters, one with Colin Baker, one with David Warner and some Dalek stuff\nwith Nick Briggs. It was always something I really enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lovely little job when it came along, so it\u2019s nice\nto return to that because doing audio stuff is always really good fun. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an immediacy to it \u2013 you turn up and haven\u2019t\nlearned the lines \u2013 you prepare a little but basically you are flying by the\nseat of your pants, to a certain extent, and if you have got lots of good\nactors who inspire you and make it good fun, it\u2019s really not a bad way to spend\na day. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite tiring and it\u2019s quite intensive because you do a\nstory in a day, faster than you work on Radio 4, but there\u2019s such an energy to\nthis stuff, you can\u2019t help but be barrelled along by it. It took about two\nweeks to do a show on TV!\u201d </p><p>Jason Haigh-Ellery was particularly delighted to welcome\nDavid back into the Big Finish family. </p><p>He says: \u201cYou know what, it didn\u2019t feel like David had been\naway for a decade. That\u2019s just unbelievable. When David came back it felt he\u2019d\nonly been away for a year or so, it really didn\u2019t feel like it had been 10\nyears. </p><p>\u201cAs ever, David was lovely to everybody, and he slotted\nright back in. \u201cDavid has an amazing memory and he remembers everyone\u2019s name.\nHe just walked in and went around, saying hello to everybody. He was wonderful.\n</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great having him back, and I hope we will do more with\nhim.\u201d </p><p>Being back as the Doctor has been a joy for David, but he\nadmits it was a bit of a worry to start with. </p><p>He says: \u201cIt\u2019s been really good fun. I was a bit nervous\nabout whether I would slip into it with ease, or would it be a bit of a\nstretch, but it really felt like returning to a comfy pair of trousers, rather\nthan a scratchy vest. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all quite high energy, the character, but once you key\ninto it, it always makes sense. </p><p>\u201cThat was always the key to it, it was very tiring to do,\nbut they\u2019ve also been invigorating. It has its own momentum, I think. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d always used the script as my springboard, really, from\nwhat Russell T Davies and the other writers wrote and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve\ncontinued to do here. You take what\u2019s on the page and use it as your starting\npoint. </p><p>\u201cIf you come at a character like this with pre-conceived\nnotions, that you might play him like this or that, the danger is you can be\nfighting the actual story and the script \u2013 the whole thing has got to evolve as\none piece.\u201d </p><p>David was particularly pleased to be reunited with Catherine\nTate \u2013 with whom he has also worked on Comic Relief, Much Ado About Nothing and\nNever Mind The Buzzcocks and the recent Shakespeare Live \u2013 as they have a firm\nestablished friendship. </p><p>He says: \u201cI think Catherine and I always got on, right from\nthe moment she came to do the tiny bit at the end of Doomsday. She came down\nand shot the cliffhanger for series two. It took all of half-an-hour and from\nthat moment, we got on \u2013 and always have done. That\u2019s something we can\nhopefully bring to the characters. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked together in various places and in various ways\nand it\u2019s something we enjoy doing. It\u2019s just always nice to see her and it\u2019s\nnice to play.\u201d</p><p><i><br></i></p><h2><i>\u201cI think\nCatherine and I always got on, right from the moment she came to do the tiny\nbit at the end of <b>Doomsday</b>.\u201d</i></h2><blockquote><p><i> \u2013 David Tennant</i></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>For the Big Finish production team, there was a huge sense\nof relief when they finally got their leading man and woman into studio after\nmonths of planning.<br></p><p>Nick says: \u201cThere was a great sense of occasion. And it was\nwonderful to hear David and Catherine working together. I actually thought\nCatherine\u2019s performance was slightly different to her performance on TV. She\nseemed far more restrained than I expected her to be. </p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s a very shrewd actress, and she knew just how to\npitch it when acting so close to a microphone.</p><p><br></p><h2><i>\u201cThe camaraderie\nexisted the moment people arrived at the studio, that people were familiar with\neach other.\u201d </i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 David Richardson</i></p></blockquote><p><br></p><figure data-orig-height=\"202\" data-orig-width=\"249\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3bd8c2b6cc9e4fcea5629188855014bb/tumblr_inline_ppusl5bqp21rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"202\" data-orig-width=\"249\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Left to right:\nBeth Chalmers, Blake Ritson, Alice Krige, and Alan Cox<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>\u201cI think what she\u2019s done for us is rather beautiful and\noften very moving in all sorts of unexpected ways. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve run out of words to describe how brilliant David is.\nHe\u2019s a lovely chap. Very easygoing and fun to work with and\u2026 well, he just\ndelivers! It\u2019s such a joy to behold.\u201d </p><p>David Richardson adds: \u201cIn the months running up to the\nrecording, I\u2019d got myself in a terrible state of stress. \u201cIt was clear every\nstep of the way how momentous these episodes would be, and I felt the pressure\nthat they had to be as good as they possibly could be, and that David and\nCatherine should have as great a time as they possibly could recording it. </p><p>\u201cOf course, I needn\u2019t have worried. For two huge,\ninternational stars they are very laid back and approachable people. It was\nlovely to sit and chat with David in the green room, and to hear him say he had\nbought our <b>Blake\u2019s 7</b> audios and\nenjoyed them! </p><p>\u201cNick let me cast all the plays, and I was very careful to\nhire people that we knew were accomplished actors and fun to be around, but\nalso to have some people who David and Catherine would know and feel\ncomfortable working with. So it was great to have Niky Wardley, who was one of\nthe mainstays of <b>The Catherine Tate Show</b>.\nAlex Lowe and Alan Cox knew both David and Catherine. Dan Starkey had worked\nwith them on the TV series\u2026 It meant the cameraderie existed the moment people\narrived at the studio, that people were familiar with each other. </p><p>\u201cOh, and I cast Alice Krige because she really is one of my\nfavourite actors, and one of my favourite people to be with at the studio. I\u2019ve\nworked with Alice three times now, and we just sit and have the most extraordinary\nconversations about life. She\u2019s wonderful.\u201d </p><p>The pair found there to be so many highlights over the three\nstudio days. </p><p>Nick pauses, before saying: \u201cThere are so many. But I think\nmy personal highlight was when Catherine found so many poignant moments in\nDeath and The Queen. I had, rather unfairly, pigeon-holed it as pure knockabout\ncomedy. But Catherine saw past that and at one point brought a tear to my eye.\u201d\n</p><p>David admits: \u201cThe moment I\u2019ll always remember is recording\nthe very first scene. David and Catherine threw themselves into it like they\u2019d\nnever been away. I was in the control room, and Matt Fitton was sitting on the\nsofa and we just turned to each other and grinned the biggest grins\u2026 I love all\nthree scripts \u2013 <i>Technophobia</i> is just\nright for a Tenth Doctor opening story. <i>Time\nReaver</i> is wildly imaginative but also quite personal and dramatic too. And <i>Death and the Queen</i> is bonkers and\ntouching and brilliant.\u201d </p><p>David Tennant adds: \u201cI think the three scripts, like the TV\nshow, are very individual in themselves. </p><p>\u201cThey are very different types of stories and they each had\nquite unique concepts to them, whether it\u2019s the tone or the entire story. </p><p>\u201cThe first one is a much more recognisable world, with the\nconceit of it. You expect it to be one type of story but it\u2019s another. It\u2019s\nvery clever. I think the third is quite an unusual world. Like the TV show at\nits best, they are fun, new ways of telling the same type of stories.\u201d</p><p><br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e1382f29a89a1713f59a03d4a366b48/tumblr_inline_ppuszmL87N1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover for\u00a0\u201cTechnophobia\u201d by Matt Fitton, featuring a banner that reads\u00a0\u201cBBC Doctor Who - David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Technophobia by Matt Fitton, featuring Rachael Stirling and Niky Wardley\u201d, and a photo of David Tennant.

David and Catherine were\nthere at the very start of my \u2018professional\u2019 Doctor Who career, when I joined\nthem in series four for <i>The Sontaran Stratagem</i>\nand <i>The Poison Sky</i>, so it was nice to\ncome back to them again, now Big Finish are doing new series <b>Who</b>. </p><p>\u201cMost actors enjoy radio because it\u2019s just good fun. We get\nthe work done, and we can have a laugh with it. It\u2019s always good being in the\ngreen room at the Moat then having a great lunch \u2013 and with David and Catherine\naround, it was great fun. You can tell they really get on. </p><p>\u201cI very much enjoyed that period of the show, with the Tenth\nDoctor and Donna. It\u2019s very strange now, thinking back to how much time has\npassed since then. </p><p>\u201cI loved the way the Doctor and Donna were just great mates,\ngoing around, solving problems, and at that point, it felt like <b>Doctor Who</b> was really back and had\ntaken over television. It was a great time to be involved in it and get on the\nbandwagon! </p><p>\u201cNot having to sit in the make-up chair for three hours is\nsomething I always appreciate! </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great script by Jenny Colgan, that really captures\nthat breathless rush that was there in the series four stories. You can really\npicture the bright colours, and there\u2019s lots of pathos as well. It\u2019s got that\ntension, which is really familiar as well.\u201d </p><p>Another guest star in <i>Time\nReaver</i> is another man who has spent most of his TV <b>Doctor Who</b> career behind a mask.

It\u2019s got some slightly deconstructed elements which make it\nthe most broadly funny, the most broadly comic, of the three. That always works\nfor the Doctor and Donna as a pairing. </p><p>\u201cIt also goes to some quite dark, quite unusual places and\nyou also get to see Donna at her best. She struggles with finally getting her\nfairytale wedding, and nothing quite works out as she would imagine.\u201d </p><p>Joining the guest cast is Beth Chalmers as Hortense. </p><p>She grins: \u201cI\u2019ve now worked with every single one of the Big\nFinish Doctors \u2013 I\u2019ve worked with the others to a greater or lesser degree over\nthe years, and in the last year, I\u2019ve now added John Hurt and David Tennant \u2013\nwhich is pretty cool. </p><p>\u201cIt was a bit cloak and dagger being in this one, as I was\nonly told about it a couple of weeks before we went into the studio. I think I\nwas doing one of the John Hurt episodes, when David Richardson asked me what I\nhad coming up, and I asked him, \u2018Why?\u2019 He told me it was something they were\nkeeping very, very quiet and told me it was these two, David and Catherine. </p><p>\u201cCatherine Tate is a real treat to work with, but David\nTennant is just so classy \u2013 he\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s fantastic to work with great\nactors and he\u2019s such a brilliant guy too. I\u2019ve worked with his wife Georgia\nbefore and you hear such lovely things about him from other people who have\nworked with him \u2013 and it\u2019s all true. David\u2019s got a kind of left-field, zany\nmadness to him \u2013 he\u2019s brilliant. </p><p>\u201cI was really thrilled and knew there weren\u2019t that many\nbeing made, so it was amazing to be one of the few actors to be asked.\u201d </p><p>Beth found herself having to work hard on her character.\n\u201cThis story is a bit like a period drama, with a medieval castle. I did most of\nmy scenes with Catherine Tate, who was speaking in her modern way with her modern\nrhythms, but I had to use a period voice. It\u2019s hard to keep that going when she\u2019s\nbeing funny, quippy, cool and modern, while I had to stick with the medieval\nvoice. </p><p>\u201cBut when you compare the two voices, it makes her even more\nfunny. </p><p>\u201cIt was a great story to do \u2013 it was fun, and almost\ncartoony, but I don\u2019t mean that in any way to sound disrespectful. </p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t too many vortexes and galaxies to worry\nabout, so I could understand it! </p><p>\u201cI also loved working with Blake Ritson \u2013 I was bowled over\nwhen I heard him doing his stuff. </p><p>\u201cIt was a great day, and it felt really special in the\nstudio. I\u2019m really looking forward to hearing how it all sounds in the finished\nversion.\u201d </p><p>Responsible for the music and sound design on the trio of\ntales is Howard Carter. </p><p>Having worked on the War Doctor box sets, The Diary of River\nSong and UNIT, he\u2019s loving the chance to get the Tenth Doctor onto his CV. </p><p>When first asked to work on this series, Howard admits he\nwas: \u201cVery excited! I\u2019ve been working on the new series releases for the past\nseven months and knew these were coming up so it\u2019s great to finally get stuck\nin. I read all of the scripts in one sitting and was thrilled at how brilliant\nthey were and how much scope there was for me to be creative with the sound\ndesign and the music.\u201d </p><p>How did he approach the plays \u2013 did he try to evoke Murray\nGold\u2019s style, as well as doing his own? </p><p>Howard explains: \u201cWith the Big Finish audios I\u2019ve always\nfelt that we should be moving the world of Doctor Who forward rather than\ncreating pastiches of what\u2019s been before. While it\u2019s important to retain a\ncertain level of stylistic familiarity I was keen to make sure the musical\nlanguage was fresh and not too restricted by Murray\u2019s style. His sound has been\nso integral to the characterisation and general atmosphere of the show that it\nwould be foolish to ignore, but at the same time I feel the plays are best\nserved by taking a step forward. </p><p>\u201cAs such, I wanted to create a score that wouldn\u2019t sound out\nof place in the world that people are familiar with, while letting my own\ninfluences and style filter through. The music is still very thematic with\ncertain motifs running through the boxset, but my main aim was to write scores\nthat best serve these plays and the overall atmosphere of the set.\u201d </p><p>He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to be working on these\nstories. The scripts are so fantastic it\u2019s both humbling and exciting to be\nbringing them to life knowing that so many people will get the chance to hear\nthe Doctor and Donna back together. I can only hope people have as much fun\nlistening to them as much as I\u2019ve had working on them.\u201d </p><p>The final element that really seals the deal for these\naudios are the covers, which have been created by Tom Webster. </p><p>As with the rest of the Big Finish team, Tom was delighted\nto be working on these releases. </p><p>He adds: \u201cI was so excited to work with the David and\nCatherine images. I think the moment where I started to cut the images out was\nwhere it really hit me, the Tenth Doctor and Donna in Big Finish. Amazing! </p><p>\u201cI found it quite easy to create a feel for the era on the\nspecial deluxe edition, I set out to emulate the style of the series box sets\nand particularly the vanilla DVDs. I wanted to go with very bright, vibrant\ncolours and the most dynamic photos that I could use. </p><p>\u201cI decided from an early stage that I wanted to play with a\nTARDIS interior motif - so I created something inspired by the coral\nstructures, which provided a nice framework. The vanilla covers were lots of\nfun, as I was tasked with making each one distinctly different. Technophobia\nreally feels like a Russell T Davies episode one, so I really wanted to go for\na bright and brash impactful image. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually extremely happy with them all, I spent lots of\ntime getting them just the way I\u2019d imagined when reading the scripts. I\u2019m so\ngrateful for the opportunity to be doing such huge releases for Big Finish and\nI didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. I hope people enjoy them!\u201d </p><p>Since the Big Finish Tenth Doctor audios were first\nannounced, they have received plenty of coverage in the media, from\npublications as diverse as Jenny Colgan\u2019s local newspaper the Ayrshire Post, to\nnational papers like the Daily Mirror, whilst they\u2019ve also had numerous\nmentions on TV, including a big plug on <b>The\nJonathan Ross Show</b> on ITV. </p><p>David Richardson says: \u201cWe knew the reaction was going to be\nhuge. And it was probably bigger than that! So it was brilliant, and such a\nrelief to have the secret out there having kept it to ourselves for so long.\nWe\u2019d had a year of whispering in locked rooms and sending coded emails \u2013 and\nsuddenly all the world knew!\u201d </p><p>Nick adds: \u201cCan I just say too how delighted I was? It was\none of those things. We\u2019d been living with these plays for so long. It seemed\nalmost surreal that we were actually doing them. And when our listeners and\nother <b>Doctor Who</b> fans loved the idea\ntoo\u2026 It was simply amazing.\u201d </p><p>Jason was particularly pleased that Big Finish received so\nmany mentions when David was doing the media rounds to promote his Netflix\nseries <b>Jessica Jones</b>. </p><p>He laughs: \u201cI feel like sending the publicist for <b>Jessica Jones</b> a bunch of roses! </p><p>\u201cThey did a great job to get David on a lot of programmes to\ntalk about <b>Jessica Jones</b>, and we\nkind of hijacked their promotional tour! </p><p>\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve done over the years, that\ndefinitely got us the most media attention. </p><p>\u201cDavid, I\u2019m sure, knows how much he was loved as <b>Doctor Who</b>. If he ever had any doubts,\nI think going round and doing publicity for <b>Jessica Jones</b>, where everyone asked him about doing the Big Finish\naudios, has shown how much people are still interested in him and love him as\nthe Doctor.\u201d</p><h2><b>\u2013 VORTEX Magazine, Issue 87, Pages 6-15</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9cbcd5f3ab49e5de6d4c711fdfb847ce/tumblr_inline_ppuu95heaG1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\"></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover of \u201cThe Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 1\u2033. <br><b>Text reads:</b> \u201cDavid Tennant - Catherine Tate<br>BBC Doctor Who<br>The Tenth Doctor Adventures<br>Three Full Cast Audio Adventures<br>Technophobia - Time Reaver - Death And The Queen\u201d<br></i><i><b>Background</b> features the Big Finish logo, Catherine Tate, David Tennant, the TARDIS, Time Reaver\u2019s antagonist, Gully, a black hooded figure, and a castle.<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><b>The Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 01</b></p><p>Technophobia<br></p><blockquote><p>London\u2019s Technology Museum faces a revolution.

He\nactually, light-heartedly, encouraged me to go out and get the licence. At one\nstage, Michael Stevens and I had plans for Big Finish and Audiogo to do a\ncoproduction of audio drama featuring the Tenth Doctor. But David&rsquo;s schedule\nand Audiogo&rsquo;s demise meant that plan didn&rsquo;t materialise. But when we finally\ngot the licence, I did chat to David on the phone. He eventually came up with\nthe idea of a special, three-CD release.&rdquo; </p><p>Line producer David Richardson adds: &ldquo;The pitch for the Big\nFinish/ AudioGO co-production still exists &ndash; although none of the stories made\nit into this collection. The plan back then was to have episodes with a running\ntheme, one that would climax with a big reveal and the return of a character\nfrom the Tenth Doctor era &ndash; but when we came to do this set of the Doctor and\nDonna stories, it was felt that it was best to go down the route of individual,\nunconnected episodes.&rdquo; </p><p>But we&rsquo;re getting ahead of ourselves a little. </p><p>This month sees the eagerly anticipated return of David,\nalongside Catherine Tate as everyone&rsquo;s favourite temp from Chiswick, Donna\nNoble.</p><p>However, the process of getting them back together hasn&rsquo;t\nbeen an easy one. </p><p>Big Finish executive producer and company chairman Jason\nHaigh-Ellery says: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a lot of support in getting series based around\nthe New Legacy Doctors. When the time was right, the BBC gave us the rights and\nhelped us to get these productions up and running as soon as possible. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really pleased to have got David and Catherine back\ntogether.</p><p><i><br /></i></p><h2><i>&ldquo;I first\ndid Big Finish with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred many years ago, certainly\nbefore Doctor Who was as central a part of my life as it has become since.&rdquo;</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>&ndash; David Tennant</i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Someone said to me, &lsquo;Why did you announce John Hurt and\nDavid Tennant just a few weeks apart?&rsquo; The thing is, it took about two weeks to\nsort John out and get him into studio. With David and Catherine, it took a year\n&ndash; and you don&rsquo;t want to announce anything until you have it recorded. </p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t in any way planned to announce them as closely\ntogether as we did, it just took us a year to sort out dates when we could get\nDavid and Catherine in studio together again. </p><p>&ldquo;It was very important to both of them that they were there,\nacting together, so they could get that old feeling going again. </p><p>&ldquo;A lot of people have said that David and Catherine&rsquo;s\nrelationship on-screen was some of the best stuff in 21st century Doctor Who,\nas a favourite combination of Doctor and companion. Seeing them work together,\nyou can tell it&rsquo;s obvious the two of them love working together and enjoy it. </p><p>&ldquo;It was well worth waiting a year for, to have them\ntogether.&rdquo; </p><p>Nick continues: &ldquo;Once the BBC accepted the proposal, David\nRichardson and script editor Matt Fitton started working on story ideas, and\nkept me informed all along the way. It looked like we might get David and\nCatherine into studio fairly imminently then, so the scripts were worked on\nquite quickly. Then, when they were ready and tentative studio bookings made,\nDavid and Catherine &ndash; very busy people! &ndash; suddenly became unavailable. So we\nhad to wait quite a while. So it&rsquo;s true to say those scripts were then waiting\nfor the final bookings to be made. So that&rsquo;s why, when the information was\nleaked on the internet, we couldn&rsquo;t comment, because we weren&rsquo;t one hundred per\ncent sure it was actually going to happen. We had everything crossed! </p><p>David Richardson adds: &ldquo;We certainly began story lining back\nin the summer of 2014, and the scripts were all signed off by May 2015. So they\nsat on the shelf for several months before we were able to get David and\nCatherine together in October.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9be1cf86727e16657c4aeea074d7fa3/tumblr_inline_ppush2gjth1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> David Tennant and Catherine Tate.<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>When it was revealed in October last year that David Tennant\nwas to play the Doctor for Big Finish, it marked his return to the Moat Studios\nafter an absence of a decade.<br /></p><p>Speaking to producer David Richardson, David Tennant\nrecalls: &ldquo;I first did Big Finish with Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred many\nyears ago, certainly before Doctor Who was as central a part of my life as it\nhas become since. </p><p>&ldquo;I was always keen to come and play. I did a few different\ncharacters, one with Colin Baker, one with David Warner and some Dalek stuff\nwith Nick Briggs. It was always something I really enjoyed.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a lovely little job when it came along, so it&rsquo;s nice\nto return to that because doing audio stuff is always really good fun. </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an immediacy to it &ndash; you turn up and haven&rsquo;t\nlearned the lines &ndash; you prepare a little but basically you are flying by the\nseat of your pants, to a certain extent, and if you have got lots of good\nactors who inspire you and make it good fun, it&rsquo;s really not a bad way to spend\na day. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite tiring and it&rsquo;s quite intensive because you do a\nstory in a day, faster than you work on Radio 4, but there&rsquo;s such an energy to\nthis stuff, you can&rsquo;t help but be barrelled along by it. It took about two\nweeks to do a show on TV!&rdquo; </p><p>Jason Haigh-Ellery was particularly delighted to welcome\nDavid back into the Big Finish family. </p><p>He says: &ldquo;You know what, it didn&rsquo;t feel like David had been\naway for a decade. That&rsquo;s just unbelievable. When David came back it felt he&rsquo;d\nonly been away for a year or so, it really didn&rsquo;t feel like it had been 10\nyears. </p><p>&ldquo;As ever, David was lovely to everybody, and he slotted\nright back in. &ldquo;David has an amazing memory and he remembers everyone&rsquo;s name.\nHe just walked in and went around, saying hello to everybody. He was wonderful.\n</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great having him back, and I hope we will do more with\nhim.&rdquo; </p><p>Being back as the Doctor has been a joy for David, but he\nadmits it was a bit of a worry to start with. </p><p>He says: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been really good fun. I was a bit nervous\nabout whether I would slip into it with ease, or would it be a bit of a\nstretch, but it really felt like returning to a comfy pair of trousers, rather\nthan a scratchy vest. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all quite high energy, the character, but once you key\ninto it, it always makes sense. </p><p>&ldquo;That was always the key to it, it was very tiring to do,\nbut they&rsquo;ve also been invigorating. It has its own momentum, I think. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d always used the script as my springboard, really, from\nwhat Russell T Davies and the other writers wrote and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve\ncontinued to do here. You take what&rsquo;s on the page and use it as your starting\npoint. </p><p>&ldquo;If you come at a character like this with pre-conceived\nnotions, that you might play him like this or that, the danger is you can be\nfighting the actual story and the script &ndash; the whole thing has got to evolve as\none piece.&rdquo; </p><p>David was particularly pleased to be reunited with Catherine\nTate &ndash; with whom he has also worked on Comic Relief, Much Ado About Nothing and\nNever Mind The Buzzcocks and the recent Shakespeare Live &ndash; as they have a firm\nestablished friendship. </p><p>He says: &ldquo;I think Catherine and I always got on, right from\nthe moment she came to do the tiny bit at the end of Doomsday. She came down\nand shot the cliffhanger for series two. It took all of half-an-hour and from\nthat moment, we got on &ndash; and always have done. That&rsquo;s something we can\nhopefully bring to the characters. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worked together in various places and in various ways\nand it&rsquo;s something we enjoy doing.

It&rsquo;s such a joy to behold.&rdquo; </p><p>David Richardson adds: &ldquo;In the months running up to the\nrecording, I&rsquo;d got myself in a terrible state of stress. &ldquo;It was clear every\nstep of the way how momentous these episodes would be, and I felt the pressure\nthat they had to be as good as they possibly could be, and that David and\nCatherine should have as great a time as they possibly could recording it. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I needn&rsquo;t have worried. For two huge,\ninternational stars they are very laid back and approachable people. It was\nlovely to sit and chat with David in the green room, and to hear him say he had\nbought our <b>Blake&rsquo;s 7</b> audios and\nenjoyed them! </p><p>&ldquo;Nick let me cast all the plays, and I was very careful to\nhire people that we knew were accomplished actors and fun to be around, but\nalso to have some people who David and Catherine would know and feel\ncomfortable working with. So it was great to have Niky Wardley, who was one of\nthe mainstays of <b>The Catherine Tate Show</b>.\nAlex Lowe and Alan Cox knew both David and Catherine. Dan Starkey had worked\nwith them on the TV series&hellip; It meant the cameraderie existed the moment people\narrived at the studio, that people were familiar with each other. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and I cast Alice Krige because she really is one of my\nfavourite actors, and one of my favourite people to be with at the studio. I&rsquo;ve\nworked with Alice three times now, and we just sit and have the most extraordinary\nconversations about life. She&rsquo;s wonderful.&rdquo; </p><p>The pair found there to be so many highlights over the three\nstudio days. </p><p>Nick pauses, before saying: &ldquo;There are so many. But I think\nmy personal highlight was when Catherine found so many poignant moments in\nDeath and The Queen. I had, rather unfairly, pigeon-holed it as pure knockabout\ncomedy. But Catherine saw past that and at one point brought a tear to my eye.&rdquo;\n</p><p>David admits: &ldquo;The moment I&rsquo;ll always remember is recording\nthe very first scene. David and Catherine threw themselves into it like they&rsquo;d\nnever been away. I was in the control room, and Matt Fitton was sitting on the\nsofa and we just turned to each other and grinned the biggest grins&hellip; I love all\nthree scripts &ndash; <i>Technophobia</i> is just\nright for a Tenth Doctor opening story. <i>Time\nReaver</i> is wildly imaginative but also quite personal and dramatic too. And <i>Death and the Queen</i> is bonkers and\ntouching and brilliant.&rdquo; </p><p>David Tennant adds: &ldquo;I think the three scripts, like the TV\nshow, are very individual in themselves. </p><p>&ldquo;They are very different types of stories and they each had\nquite unique concepts to them, whether it&rsquo;s the tone or the entire story. </p><p>&ldquo;The first one is a much more recognisable world, with the\nconceit of it. You expect it to be one type of story but it&rsquo;s another. It&rsquo;s\nvery clever. I think the third is quite an unusual world. Like the TV show at\nits best, they are fun, new ways of telling the same type of stories.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e1382f29a89a1713f59a03d4a366b48/tumblr_inline_ppuszmL87N1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover for&nbsp;&ldquo;Technophobia&rdquo; by Matt Fitton, featuring a banner that reads&nbsp;&ldquo;BBC Doctor Who - David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Technophobia by Matt Fitton, featuring Rachael Stirling and Niky Wardley&rdquo;, and a photo of David Tennant.

It&rsquo;s not an idea\nI&rsquo;ve come across in <b>Doctor Who</b>\nbefore.&rdquo; </p><p>Joining the cast is Niky Wardley playing Bex. Niky is no\nstranger to Big Finish, after appearing as the Eighth Doctor&rsquo;s companion Tamsin\nDrew. </p><p>She tells Vortex: &ldquo;What a treat to work with Catherine and\nDavid on Big Finish. David Richardson had asked me to be in it but I had no\nidea who else was in it until I saw the cast list a few days before so it was\nthe best surprise! </p><p>&ldquo;I was lucky enough to be recording with them on their first\nday, so to see them walk into their booths and then voice the Doctor and Donna\nagain, after such a hiatus, was incredible. </p><p>&ldquo;They bounced back to life straight away such is their\namazing chemistry. David&rsquo;s energy as the Doctor is so affecting, he sweeps you\nalong with him and Catherine&rsquo;s genius with comedy makes it just the perfect\npartnership. It was thrilling to be a part of it.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4fad9b44a772e5e8c62cd81ba16eed6/tumblr_inline_pput8yNEe91rkf3jm_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p><i><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover for &ldquo;Time Reaver&rdquo; by Jenny T Colgan, featuring a banner that reads &ldquo;BBC Doctor Who - David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Time Reaver by Jenny T Colgan, featuring Sabrina Bartlett, Terry Molloy, and Dan Starkey&rdquo;, and a photo of David Tennant.

These days\nhe&rsquo;s best known to <b>Doctor Who</b> fans\nas Strax from the Paternoster Gang, alongside the Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors,\nbut he was delighted to work with the leading pair &ndash; for a very nostalgic\nreason. </p><p>He reveals: &ldquo;It was a great day. David and Catherine were\nthere at the very start of my &lsquo;professional&rsquo; Doctor Who career, when I joined\nthem in series four for <i>The Sontaran Stratagem</i>\nand <i>The Poison Sky</i>, so it was nice to\ncome back to them again, now Big Finish are doing new series <b>Who</b>. </p><p>&ldquo;Most actors enjoy radio because it&rsquo;s just good fun. We get\nthe work done, and we can have a laugh with it. It&rsquo;s always good being in the\ngreen room at the Moat then having a great lunch &ndash; and with David and Catherine\naround, it was great fun. You can tell they really get on. </p><p>&ldquo;I very much enjoyed that period of the show, with the Tenth\nDoctor and Donna. It&rsquo;s very strange now, thinking back to how much time has\npassed since then. </p><p>&ldquo;I loved the way the Doctor and Donna were just great mates,\ngoing around, solving problems, and at that point, it felt like <b>Doctor Who</b> was really back and had\ntaken over television. It was a great time to be involved in it and get on the\nbandwagon! </p><p>&ldquo;Not having to sit in the make-up chair for three hours is\nsomething I always appreciate! </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great script by Jenny Colgan, that really captures\nthat breathless rush that was there in the series four stories. You can really\npicture the bright colours, and there&rsquo;s lots of pathos as well. It&rsquo;s got that\ntension, which is really familiar as well.&rdquo; </p><p>Another guest star in <i>Time\nReaver</i> is another man who has spent most of his TV <b>Doctor Who</b> career behind a mask. Terry Molloy plays Rone in this\nstory, but is best remembered for playing Davros against Peter Davison, Colin\nBaker and Sylvester McCoy&rsquo;s Time Lords. </p><p>Terry recalls: &ldquo;It was lovely to be at the microphone with\nDavid again, as we had previously worked together back in the 90s on a radio\nversion of Edward Bond&rsquo;s play <b>The Sea</b>.\nIn <i>Time Reaver</i>, the studio fizzed\nwith the energy and pace he always brings to the Doctor, and of course the\ninterplay between him and Catherine Tate was fast, furious and very funny!&rdquo; </p><h2><i>&ldquo;It was a\ngreat day. David and Catherine were there at the very start of my &lsquo;Professional&rsquo;\n<b>Doctor Who</b> career.&rdquo;</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>&ndash; Dan Starkey</i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d210d6e752ff30dbe7cca04e96d95945/tumblr_inline_ppuu0getuh1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p><i><i><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover for &ldquo;Death and the Queen&rdquo; by James Goss, featuring a banner that reads &ldquo;BBC Doctor Who - David Tennant and Catherine Tate in Death And The Queen by James Goss, featuring Alice Krige, Alan Cox, and Blake Ritson&rdquo;, and a photo of David Tennant.

It&rsquo;s got some slightly deconstructed elements which make it\nthe most broadly funny, the most broadly comic, of the three. That always works\nfor the Doctor and Donna as a pairing. </p><p>&ldquo;It also goes to some quite dark, quite unusual places and\nyou also get to see Donna at her best. She struggles with finally getting her\nfairytale wedding, and nothing quite works out as she would imagine.&rdquo; </p><p>Joining the guest cast is Beth Chalmers as Hortense. </p><p>She grins: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve now worked with every single one of the Big\nFinish Doctors &ndash; I&rsquo;ve worked with the others to a greater or lesser degree over\nthe years, and in the last year, I&rsquo;ve now added John Hurt and David Tennant &ndash;\nwhich is pretty cool. </p><p>&ldquo;It was a bit cloak and dagger being in this one, as I was\nonly told about it a couple of weeks before we went into the studio. I think I\nwas doing one of the John Hurt episodes, when David Richardson asked me what I\nhad coming up, and I asked him, &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; He told me it was something they were\nkeeping very, very quiet and told me it was these two, David and Catherine. </p><p>&ldquo;Catherine Tate is a real treat to work with, but David\nTennant is just so classy &ndash; he&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s fantastic to work with great\nactors and he&rsquo;s such a brilliant guy too. I&rsquo;ve worked with his wife Georgia\nbefore and you hear such lovely things about him from other people who have\nworked with him &ndash; and it&rsquo;s all true. David&rsquo;s got a kind of left-field, zany\nmadness to him &ndash; he&rsquo;s brilliant. </p><p>&ldquo;I was really thrilled and knew there weren&rsquo;t that many\nbeing made, so it was amazing to be one of the few actors to be asked.&rdquo; </p><p>Beth found herself having to work hard on her character.\n&ldquo;This story is a bit like a period drama, with a medieval castle. I did most of\nmy scenes with Catherine Tate, who was speaking in her modern way with her modern\nrhythms, but I had to use a period voice. It&rsquo;s hard to keep that going when she&rsquo;s\nbeing funny, quippy, cool and modern, while I had to stick with the medieval\nvoice. </p><p>&ldquo;But when you compare the two voices, it makes her even more\nfunny. </p><p>&ldquo;It was a great story to do &ndash; it was fun, and almost\ncartoony, but I don&rsquo;t mean that in any way to sound disrespectful. </p><p>&ldquo;There weren&rsquo;t too many vortexes and galaxies to worry\nabout, so I could understand it! </p><p>&ldquo;I also loved working with Blake Ritson &ndash; I was bowled over\nwhen I heard him doing his stuff. </p><p>&ldquo;It was a great day, and it felt really special in the\nstudio. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to hearing how it all sounds in the finished\nversion.&rdquo; </p><p>Responsible for the music and sound design on the trio of\ntales is Howard Carter. </p><p>Having worked on the War Doctor box sets, The Diary of River\nSong and UNIT, he&rsquo;s loving the chance to get the Tenth Doctor onto his CV. </p><p>When first asked to work on this series, Howard admits he\nwas: &ldquo;Very excited! I&rsquo;ve been working on the new series releases for the past\nseven months and knew these were coming up so it&rsquo;s great to finally get stuck\nin. I read all of the scripts in one sitting and was thrilled at how brilliant\nthey were and how much scope there was for me to be creative with the sound\ndesign and the music.&rdquo; </p><p>How did he approach the plays &ndash; did he try to evoke Murray\nGold&rsquo;s style, as well as doing his own? </p><p>Howard explains: &ldquo;With the Big Finish audios I&rsquo;ve always\nfelt that we should be moving the world of Doctor Who forward rather than\ncreating pastiches of what&rsquo;s been before. While it&rsquo;s important to retain a\ncertain level of stylistic familiarity I was keen to make sure the musical\nlanguage was fresh and not too restricted by Murray&rsquo;s style. His sound has been\nso integral to the characterisation and general atmosphere of the show that it\nwould be foolish to ignore, but at the same time I feel the plays are best\nserved by taking a step forward. </p><p>&ldquo;As such, I wanted to create a score that wouldn&rsquo;t sound out\nof place in the world that people are familiar with, while letting my own\ninfluences and style filter through. The music is still very thematic with\ncertain motifs running through the boxset, but my main aim was to write scores\nthat best serve these plays and the overall atmosphere of the set.&rdquo; </p><p>He adds: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great privilege to be working on these\nstories. The scripts are so fantastic it&rsquo;s both humbling and exciting to be\nbringing them to life knowing that so many people will get the chance to hear\nthe Doctor and Donna back together. I can only hope people have as much fun\nlistening to them as much as I&rsquo;ve had working on them.&rdquo; </p><p>The final element that really seals the deal for these\naudios are the covers, which have been created by Tom Webster. </p><p>As with the rest of the Big Finish team, Tom was delighted\nto be working on these releases. </p><p>He adds: &ldquo;I was so excited to work with the David and\nCatherine images. I think the moment where I started to cut the images out was\nwhere it really hit me, the Tenth Doctor and Donna in Big Finish. Amazing! </p><p>&ldquo;I found it quite easy to create a feel for the era on the\nspecial deluxe edition, I set out to emulate the style of the series box sets\nand particularly the vanilla DVDs. I wanted to go with very bright, vibrant\ncolours and the most dynamic photos that I could use. </p><p>&ldquo;I decided from an early stage that I wanted to play with a\nTARDIS interior motif - so I created something inspired by the coral\nstructures, which provided a nice framework. The vanilla covers were lots of\nfun, as I was tasked with making each one distinctly different. Technophobia\nreally feels like a Russell T Davies episode one, so I really wanted to go for\na bright and brash impactful image. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually extremely happy with them all, I spent lots of\ntime getting them just the way I&rsquo;d imagined when reading the scripts. I&rsquo;m so\ngrateful for the opportunity to be doing such huge releases for Big Finish and\nI didn&rsquo;t want to let anyone down. I hope people enjoy them!&rdquo; </p><p>Since the Big Finish Tenth Doctor audios were first\nannounced, they have received plenty of coverage in the media, from\npublications as diverse as Jenny Colgan&rsquo;s local newspaper the Ayrshire Post, to\nnational papers like the Daily Mirror, whilst they&rsquo;ve also had numerous\nmentions on TV, including a big plug on <b>The\nJonathan Ross Show</b> on ITV. </p><p>David Richardson says: &ldquo;We knew the reaction was going to be\nhuge. And it was probably bigger than that! So it was brilliant, and such a\nrelief to have the secret out there having kept it to ourselves for so long.\nWe&rsquo;d had a year of whispering in locked rooms and sending coded emails &ndash; and\nsuddenly all the world knew!&rdquo; </p><p>Nick adds: &ldquo;Can I just say too how delighted I was? It was\none of those things. We&rsquo;d been living with these plays for so long. It seemed\nalmost surreal that we were actually doing them. And when our listeners and\nother <b>Doctor Who</b> fans loved the idea\ntoo&hellip; It was simply amazing.&rdquo; </p><p>Jason was particularly pleased that Big Finish received so\nmany mentions when David was doing the media rounds to promote his Netflix\nseries <b>Jessica Jones</b>. </p><p>He laughs: &ldquo;I feel like sending the publicist for <b>Jessica Jones</b> a bunch of roses! </p><p>&ldquo;They did a great job to get David on a lot of programmes to\ntalk about <b>Jessica Jones</b>, and we\nkind of hijacked their promotional tour! </p><p>&ldquo;Of all the things we&rsquo;ve done over the years, that\ndefinitely got us the most media attention. </p><p>&ldquo;David, I&rsquo;m sure, knows how much he was loved as <b>Doctor Who</b>. If he ever had any doubts,\nI think going round and doing publicity for <b>Jessica Jones</b>, where everyone asked him about doing the Big Finish\naudios, has shown how much people are still interested in him and love him as\nthe Doctor.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>&ndash; VORTEX Magazine, Issue 87, Pages 6-15</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9cbcd5f3ab49e5de6d4c711fdfb847ce/tumblr_inline_ppuu95heaG1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b><i>[Above</i></b><i> Cover of &ldquo;The Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 1&Prime;. <br /><b>Text reads:</b> &ldquo;David Tennant - Catherine Tate<br />BBC Doctor Who<br />The Tenth Doctor Adventures<br />Three Full Cast Audio Adventures<br />Technophobia - Time Reaver - Death And The Queen&rdquo;<br /></i><i><b>Background</b> features the Big Finish logo, Catherine Tate, David Tennant, the TARDIS, Time Reaver&rsquo;s antagonist, Gully, a black hooded figure, and a castle.<b>]</b></i></p></blockquote><p><b>The Tenth Doctor Adventures: Volume 01</b></p><p>Technophobia<br /></p><blockquote><p>London&rsquo;s Technology Museum faces a revolution.
