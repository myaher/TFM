No more reproach,\nfor not being enough, for not being Qui-Gon Jinn, for just being himself.</p><p>He leaned up to watch Mace and the Korrun\ngrinned at him, carding his hair from his fingers. The grin took ten years out\nof his habitually stern face. Mace adored the red hair of his lover, and\nObi-Wan, who had just spent a long mission on a desert world, was particularly\ncopper that day. </p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d Mace asked, as he scratched him just\nwhere Obi-Wan preferred, a little high on the neck.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Oi-Wan purred. The collar wasn\u2019t\ntight, just perfectly tailored, in a dark leather with a silver buckle, and\nwearing it was a little like deep meditation, its simple weight rejuvenating\nand exhilarating at the same time. </p><p>\u201cI have a gift for you,\u201d Mace revealed, \u201cBring\nme the box on the bed. And no pecking, or I will take my hand to your\nbackside.\u201d</p><p>When he left the room, Obi-Wan could feel the\ngaze of Mace. It was like a caress. The box on the bed was brown with no\nfrills, just a blue line on the lid. He recognized the packaging: whatever it\nwas, it came from the same discreet shop where they had brought the collar.\nLust flashed in his brain, sudden and hot. There had been a lot of things in\nthat shop. Things Obi-Wan had recognized, things he hadn\u2019t, and every\npossibilities made blood rush south. \u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t peek. The next day would be full of\nmeetings, he had no desire to feel during all of them the results of Mace\u2019s\npunishment. His Dom never used anything else than his hand, but did it with\ntalent! </p><p>When Obi-Wan went back to the living room, his\nlover had served himself a glass of that sweet wine Bail had gifted them for\ntheir first anniversary. Obi-Wan felt another surge of desire. Mace drank very\nlittle, in fact he only did it when he was feeling particularly happy, a little\nindulgent. </p><p>Whatever was in that box, it was something Mace\nhad thought about for a long time. Obi-Wan kneeled before offering the box. His\nteasing Dom didn\u2019t open it, just put it on his knees and smiled to Obi-Wan,\nfull of teeth. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift best appreciated naked, darling,\u201d\nhe said and Obi-Wan stood up and began to disrobe. He didn\u2019t try to make it\nsensual or anything like that, he would have feel ridiculous, but the simple\ngaze of Mace, as Obi-Wan slowly opened tunics and pants, carefully folded them,\nlayer after layer, offering himself to the eyes of his lover\u2026Obi-Wan felt\nloved, felt beautiful. There was something thrilling to being taken by Mace and\nfell on his skin the rough clothes of the other man clothing.</p><p>When he knelt, naked save for the collar, his\nrespiration was quicker and his cheeks red. Mace caressed his hair, his cheek,\nthe corner of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cRemember your safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChancellor,\u201d Obi-Wan immediately answered. </p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d </p><p>Mace opened the box and Obi-Wan dared a careful\ngaze. Inside, there were two compartments. One contained something folded,\nblack and in lace\u2026 The other made him gasp. It was a leash, in the same leather\nof his collar. Mace let him look for a few seconds, probably waiting to see if\nObi-Wan would protest, but the other man didn\u2019t, not when his pulse had\nquickened, and the universe had begun to shrink down to the two of them, his\nbrain already more silent. </p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d Mace ordered, \u201cRaise your foot. The\nother.\u201d The Korrun raised up the black lace around Obi-Wan\u2019s legs. It was some\nsort of underwear, something Obi-Wan had only seen on display advertising, on\nthe bottom of young Twil\u2019eks. He didn\u2019t know his size existed. He didn\u2019t know\nit would be so soft against his skin, that his hard half cock would be nested\ninside like that\u2026Mace\u2019s hand trailed against his ass, and Obi-Wan squeaked as\nhe discovered there was an opening behind, just large enough for Mace to tease him\u2026</p><p>Mace kissed him and Obi-Wan opened gratefully\nfor the kiss, welcoming his tongue and the heat of his desire. The second hand\nof Mace had joined the first, caressing his hips, his ass, his covered sex. The\nlace magnified the sensations in a way he didn\u2019t know was possible. He was\npanting by the time the kiss ended. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Mace whispered against his\nlips, his hands caressing the lace lightly, \u201cPerfect for me,\u201d and Obi-Wan\u2019s\nheart beat a little harder from the praise. </p><p>Mace cliked the lash on the buckle of the\ncollar, and Obi-Wan let everything fly away. Outside, the war, the Sith,\noutside despair and too much expectations on their shoulders, and the trap they\nall felt closing around them. </p><p>Inside, for a few blessed hours, peace, lust and\nlove. </p>",

Obi-Wan felt another surge of desire. Mace drank very\nlittle, in fact he only did it when he was feeling particularly happy, a little\nindulgent. </p><p>Whatever was in that box, it was something Mace\nhad thought about for a long time. Obi-Wan kneeled before offering the box. His\nteasing Dom didn\u2019t open it, just put it on his knees and smiled to Obi-Wan,\nfull of teeth. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift best appreciated naked, darling,\u201d\nhe said and Obi-Wan stood up and began to disrobe. He didn\u2019t try to make it\nsensual or anything like that, he would have feel ridiculous, but the simple\ngaze of Mace, as Obi-Wan slowly opened tunics and pants, carefully folded them,\nlayer after layer, offering himself to the eyes of his lover\u2026Obi-Wan felt\nloved, felt beautiful. There was something thrilling to being taken by Mace and\nfell on his skin the rough clothes of the other man clothing.</p><p>When he knelt, naked save for the collar, his\nrespiration was quicker and his cheeks red. Mace caressed his hair, his cheek,\nthe corner of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cRemember your safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChancellor,\u201d Obi-Wan immediately answered. </p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d </p><p>Mace opened the box and Obi-Wan dared a careful\ngaze. Inside, there were two compartments. One contained something folded,\nblack and in lace\u2026 The other made him gasp. It was a leash, in the same leather\nof his collar. Mace let him look for a few seconds, probably waiting to see if\nObi-Wan would protest, but the other man didn\u2019t, not when his pulse had\nquickened, and the universe had begun to shrink down to the two of them, his\nbrain already more silent. </p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d Mace ordered, \u201cRaise your foot. The\nother.\u201d The Korrun raised up the black lace around Obi-Wan\u2019s legs. It was some\nsort of underwear, something Obi-Wan had only seen on display advertising, on\nthe bottom of young Twil\u2019eks. He didn\u2019t know his size existed. He didn\u2019t know\nit would be so soft against his skin, that his hard half cock would be nested\ninside like that\u2026Mace\u2019s hand trailed against his ass, and Obi-Wan squeaked as\nhe discovered there was an opening behind, just large enough for Mace to tease him\u2026</p><p>Mace kissed him and Obi-Wan opened gratefully\nfor the kiss, welcoming his tongue and the heat of his desire. The second hand\nof Mace had joined the first, caressing his hips, his ass, his covered sex. The\nlace magnified the sensations in a way he didn\u2019t know was possible. He was\npanting by the time the kiss ended. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Mace whispered against his\nlips, his hands caressing the lace lightly, \u201cPerfect for me,\u201d and Obi-Wan\u2019s\nheart beat a little harder from the praise. </p><p>Mace cliked the lash on the buckle of the\ncollar, and Obi-Wan let everything fly away. Outside, the war, the Sith,\noutside despair and too much expectations on their shoulders, and the trap they\nall felt closing around them. </p><p>Inside, for a few blessed hours, peace, lust and\nlove. </p>",
