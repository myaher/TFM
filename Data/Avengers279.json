Agent L/N,\nwas married with a child, and all three had gone missing. They had no doubt\nthat this was the work of HYDRA, and that mortified SHIELD even more because of\na child being involved. All they were able to find was through searching the\nhome and CCTV of their last known locations. Agent L/N was last seen leaving\nbase, going missing between there and entering the city. Her husband had took\nthe day off work to care for their child, Y/N L/N who had been ill, and\ncamera\u2019s showed your father rushing out the building holding you, barely 8\nyears old and still in pyjamas, jumping in the car and rushing away. Searching\nthe house found no sign of a struggle, but there was a little bit of blood\nfound in your bed, confirmed to be yours.</p><p>It had been 7 years, and the case was cold. It bothered a\nlot of people, and that included Steve Rogers. Especially Steve Rogers. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t assigned to your case, but he had found your file\nreport and Maria, who had been helping with the investigation told him you were\na missing person under the protection of SHIELD. Steve straight out begged to\nbe part of the case, and Fury allowed it. He found out everything that they had\nknown about yours and your family\u2019s case, and it made him sick to his stomach. </p><p>He came up with some theories that ultimately allowed the\ncase to gain some heat. He came up with the theory that you had coughed up the\nblood and your father was planning to rush you to hospital, but got caught on\nthe way there. That then brought up that you were supposedly ill with just a\nbit of vomiting from a school bug, proven by your mom going to pharmacy to pick\nup the tablets. However, he then asked if they had found the tablets in the\nhouse. They said yes, but hadn\u2019t actually tested them. Turns out they were\nactually mild poison. It was all planned. You were ill, a bug probably passed\naround at your school, and they used it to their advantage. While it was\nprogress, Steve still felt awful about the whole thing. He instructed an\ninvestigation on the pharmacist who sold the drugs, only to find out that he\nhad been hired a week before hand, and left 5 weeks after your disappearance.\nThere was no doubt he was with HYDRA, hired purely to make sure you got worse\nso your dad would take you to the hospital, and on the way they could attack.\nYour mom had left early, due to your dad calling to tell her about your\ncondition. <i>They\u2019d used you, a child, as\nleverage. And that infuriated him. </i></p><p>The case went cold again after that, but it bothered Steve\nevery day. He looked at your case every day, looking for something he could\nhave missed. Eventually he realised that there was nothing else he could do\nwithout searching each and every HYDRA base and their files, or to imprison and\ntorture a HYDRA agent until they spilled, but he didn\u2019t want to be like them,\nso he chose the first option.</p><p>He was on another mission. SHIELD had found a base, so they\nsent Steve, Tony, Clint and Natasha to deal with it properly. They were having\nto move fast to get in before the group could destroy evidence, both inanimate\nand alive. \u201cTony, go from above, Clint, get to the second level, Natasha you\u2019re\nfirst.\u201d Steve ordered, throwing his shield to hit some agents with guns,\npunching through them and grabbing his shield again to proceed with Natasha\nthrough the first floor. Natasha went forward, dealing with the agents who\nhadn\u2019t surrendered, while Steve noticed a door to the left. He got a bad- an\nawful feeling about that door, so he raised his shield, heading over to the\ndoor slowly. He could feel the agents all staring at him, and he knew that they\nwere hiding something behind that door. </p><p>He opened it, finding stairs. \u201cI\u2019m heading down here\nNatasha, secure this place, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d Steve announced. Natasha only\nnodded as she worked in handcuffing the multitude of agents, before Steve\njogged down the stairs. </p><p>He came to a room, both sides of the room occupied with\ncells with the wall made of glass to show everything inside. They left only a\nnarrow hallway for Steve to walk passed, and he realised what was going on, and\nit made him sick. The rooms were clouded with some green gas, and he could see\nbodies of people pressed up against the glass, not moving. This gas was\npoisonous, and they\u2019d been killed. He walked passed them all, looking at each\nuntil he froze at one. The body, while curled up, could be made out as Agent\nL/N, her face etched into madness and pain, but eyes dull and skin pale.\n\u201cShit\u2026\u201d He almost didn\u2019t want to turn, but had to, seeing her husband in the\nopposite cell in a similar state. He felt everything he\u2019d been trying to do for\nall those years on the case were for nothing, and it made him feel more angry\nthat he\u2019ll never know what HYDRA wanted from them or what they did to you\u2026\nwait, where we you? </p><p>His eyes shifted, seeing only two more cells. The one next\nto your father was filled with the clouded poison, and he was worried that he\nhad found you\u2026 but the body was too big. He walked a little further, looking\ninto the last cell\u2026 and he saw you. </p><p>You\u2019d given up. You were curled up, sat against the wall\nwith your head in your knees, your back jolting lightly occasionally. You were\ncrying. It tore Steve up, but also gave him hope. He had to get you out of\nhere. He could see your cell clearly, seeing the ventilation, knowing they\ncould fill the room and kill you at any second. He tightened his grip on his\nshield, pulling his arm back and hitting hit against the glass. </p><p>You jumped at the sound, away from the glass, seeing the man\nwith a shield who had managed to crack the glass, though it didn\u2019t shatter. You\nlooked at him like he was the first human you\u2019d seen in years, before snapping\nout of your moment when a hissing sound released from behind you. You looked\nback, seeing green smoke emerging from the vents. You knew what it was, and\nscrambled up, hitting the glass as well. \u201cPlease! Please!\u201d You begged\ndesperately. Steve took another swing at the glass, though it still wouldn\u2019t\nshatter. You started to cough, the feeling of light headedness and tiredness\nfilling your body. Your punches to the glass became weaker, until you fell to\nyour knees. Steve continued to try and break the glass. </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d Tony asked after regrouping. The raid was a\nsuccess, and they had all met on the first floor to hold all the surrendered.\nNatasha was about to answer when she heard the shatter of glass. They all\nlooked at the door, starting to see faint green smoke emerging from it. They\nstarted to approach until Steve emerged, running out. </p><p>\u201cShut the door!\u201d He demanded. \u00a0Clint rushed over, slamming it shut, stopping\nany more smoke. Steve had rushed past them, not giving them time to look at\nwhat he was holding tightly as he cleared a table of the things on it, gently\nlaying you down on it. </p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Natasha commented, rushing over, with Tony and\nClint not far behind, soon surrounding you with Steve. \u201cThat\u2019s the kid from the\ncase you\u2019ve been working on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N. Their name is Y/N\u2026\u201d Steve told her, though he was more\nfocussed on you. You weren\u2019t breathing, and you were growing paler and paler.\nHe pressed his head to your chest, listening intently, before pulling away,\nputting his hand on top of his other, curling the fingers into the palm of his\nother hand, and starting to press hard and fast on your chest. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened down there?\u201d Clint asked.</p><p>\u201cThey were in a holding cell\u2026 they were trying to get rid of\nthe evidence by killing them. Agent L/N and her husband are dead, Y/N was the\nonly one not dead down there when I arrived. The toxic gas they used to kill\nthem was being pumped in as I was smashing the glass.\u201d Steve explained,\ncontinuing to press on your chest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll alert base, Nat, prep the jet, Clint, get it right\noutside.\u201d Tony took charge, his two other teammates doing as told while Tony\nfocussed on alerting SHIELD on Steve finding you, and needing back up to move\nthe surrendered due to you now being a top priority on this mission. Steve was\ndeaf and blind to it all, solely focussed the 14 year old in front of him who\nwas relying on him. He eventually saw your throat move, taking in air, and he\nquickly pressed his ear to your chest again, squeezing his eyes shut and just\npraying for a heartbeat. He sighed with relief at the gentle thump he heard.</p><p>Clint got the jet right outside the main doors as the\nretrieval team arrived, and they were off back to base as the surrendered were\nbeing rounded up and arrested. The flight was deathly silent. Clint and Natasha\nflew the jet, leaving Tony and Steve with you. Tony only watched as Steve took\ncomplete control over your care. He had you on his lap, still cradling you in a\nblanket, and Tony was wondering if he saw a 14 year old teenager, or the 8 year\nold missing child that he\u2019d been torturing himself be seeing day in, day out. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen to the kid?\u201d Tony asked, looking over\nat Clint and Natasha. There was a second of silence, only prolonged when they\nfelt the eyes of Steve as well. Eventually Clint sighed, and spoke up.</p><p>\u201cChildren of dead agents aren\u2019t uncommon, and usually if the\nagent dies, we provide the financial support for that child and their parent or\nguardian until that kid\u2019s 18, like child support\u2026 However, they\u2019ve lost both\nparents, but they\u2019re still under the protection of SHIELD because of their mom\u2026\nI dunno, maybe put them in a foster family with another agent or-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll adopt them.\u201d Both Clint and Natasha took their eyes\naway from flying to look back at Steve in shock. Steve however, didn\u2019t seem\nphased by his own words, still focussed on you, the kid in his lap was still\nsick and in need of urgent care. \u201cYou do it Clint, so I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t.\nI\u2019ve been looking for this kid since I joined SHIELD, and I wasn\u2019t able to save\ntheir parents, but I can still save them.\u201d He explained. </p><p>Every agent who was involved in your case, including Maria\nand Fury themselves came to see your arrival. They were hoping for a healthy\nkid and two parents, and frowned when they saw Steve carrying you, wrapped in a\nblanket and only followed by his team. He looked up at Maria, who nodded and\nled him to the medical bay, while the rest of the team stayed behind to tell\nFury of Steve\u2019s request.</p><p>With some simple medication, oxygen mask and a little rest,\nyou were as right as rain. Steve stayed by your side till you were healthy\nenough to be woken up, and it was pretty reassuring to see the man who saved\nyou there, waiting. \u201cHello.\u201d You greeted, making the man smile. </p><p>\u201cHi Y/N. I\u2019m Steve.\u201d He greeted you back. He spent the next\nfew days just talking with you none stop. By the end of the first day, he knew\nyour favourite food, colour, and by the end of the third he got a good read on\nyour personality. Fury had agreed to let Steve adopt you, but only with your\npermission. He brought it up on the 5<sup>th </sup>day, and by the end of the\nweek, you\u2019d left the hospital to go live in a tower full of superheroes with a\nman determined to be the best dad he can be to you. You knew you were in good\nhands and that you were safe now. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

Agent L/N,\nwas married with a child, and all three had gone missing. They had no doubt\nthat this was the work of HYDRA, and that mortified SHIELD even more because of\na child being involved. All they were able to find was through searching the\nhome and CCTV of their last known locations. Agent L/N was last seen leaving\nbase, going missing between there and entering the city. Her husband had took\nthe day off work to care for their child, Y/N L/N who had been ill, and\ncamera\u2019s showed your father rushing out the building holding you, barely 8\nyears old and still in pyjamas, jumping in the car and rushing away. Searching\nthe house found no sign of a struggle, but there was a little bit of blood\nfound in your bed, confirmed to be yours.</p><p>It had been 7 years, and the case was cold. It bothered a\nlot of people, and that included Steve Rogers. Especially Steve Rogers. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t assigned to your case, but he had found your file\nreport and Maria, who had been helping with the investigation told him you were\na missing person under the protection of SHIELD. Steve straight out begged to\nbe part of the case, and Fury allowed it. He found out everything that they had\nknown about yours and your family\u2019s case, and it made him sick to his stomach. </p><p>He came up with some theories that ultimately allowed the\ncase to gain some heat. He came up with the theory that you had coughed up the\nblood and your father was planning to rush you to hospital, but got caught on\nthe way there. That then brought up that you were supposedly ill with just a\nbit of vomiting from a school bug, proven by your mom going to pharmacy to pick\nup the tablets. However, he then asked if they had found the tablets in the\nhouse. They said yes, but hadn\u2019t actually tested them. Turns out they were\nactually mild poison. It was all planned. You were ill, a bug probably passed\naround at your school, and they used it to their advantage. While it was\nprogress, Steve still felt awful about the whole thing. He instructed an\ninvestigation on the pharmacist who sold the drugs, only to find out that he\nhad been hired a week before hand, and left 5 weeks after your disappearance.\nThere was no doubt he was with HYDRA, hired purely to make sure you got worse\nso your dad would take you to the hospital, and on the way they could attack.\nYour mom had left early, due to your dad calling to tell her about your\ncondition. <i>They\u2019d used you, a child, as\nleverage. And that infuriated him. </i></p><p>The case went cold again after that, but it bothered Steve\nevery day. He looked at your case every day, looking for something he could\nhave missed. Eventually he realised that there was nothing else he could do\nwithout searching each and every HYDRA base and their files, or to imprison and\ntorture a HYDRA agent until they spilled, but he didn\u2019t want to be like them,\nso he chose the first option.</p><p>He was on another mission. SHIELD had found a base, so they\nsent Steve, Tony, Clint and Natasha to deal with it properly. They were having\nto move fast to get in before the group could destroy evidence, both inanimate\nand alive. \u201cTony, go from above, Clint, get to the second level, Natasha you\u2019re\nfirst.\u201d Steve ordered, throwing his shield to hit some agents with guns,\npunching through them and grabbing his shield again to proceed with Natasha\nthrough the first floor. Natasha went forward, dealing with the agents who\nhadn\u2019t surrendered, while Steve noticed a door to the left. He got a bad- an\nawful feeling about that door, so he raised his shield, heading over to the\ndoor slowly. He could feel the agents all staring at him, and he knew that they\nwere hiding something behind that door. </p><p>He opened it, finding stairs. \u201cI\u2019m heading down here\nNatasha, secure this place, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d Steve announced. Natasha only\nnodded as she worked in handcuffing the multitude of agents, before Steve\njogged down the stairs. </p><p>He came to a room, both sides of the room occupied with\ncells with the wall made of glass to show everything inside. They left only a\nnarrow hallway for Steve to walk passed, and he realised what was going on, and\nit made him sick.

He walked passed them all, looking at each\nuntil he froze at one. The body, while curled up, could be made out as Agent\nL/N, her face etched into madness and pain, but eyes dull and skin pale.\n\u201cShit\u2026\u201d He almost didn\u2019t want to turn, but had to, seeing her husband in the\nopposite cell in a similar state. He felt everything he\u2019d been trying to do for\nall those years on the case were for nothing, and it made him feel more angry\nthat he\u2019ll never know what HYDRA wanted from them or what they did to you\u2026\nwait, where we you? </p><p>His eyes shifted, seeing only two more cells.

Agent L/N,\nwas married with a child, and all three had gone missing. They had no doubt\nthat this was the work of HYDRA, and that mortified SHIELD even more because of\na child being involved. All they were able to find was through searching the\nhome and CCTV of their last known locations. Agent L/N was last seen leaving\nbase, going missing between there and entering the city. Her husband had took\nthe day off work to care for their child, Y/N L/N who had been ill, and\ncamera\u2019s showed your father rushing out the building holding you, barely 8\nyears old and still in pyjamas, jumping in the car and rushing away. Searching\nthe house found no sign of a struggle, but there was a little bit of blood\nfound in your bed, confirmed to be yours.</p><p>It had been 7 years, and the case was cold. It bothered a\nlot of people, and that included Steve Rogers. Especially Steve Rogers. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t assigned to your case, but he had found your file\nreport and Maria, who had been helping with the investigation told him you were\na missing person under the protection of SHIELD. Steve straight out begged to\nbe part of the case, and Fury allowed it. He found out everything that they had\nknown about yours and your family\u2019s case, and it made him sick to his stomach. </p><p>He came up with some theories that ultimately allowed the\ncase to gain some heat. He came up with the theory that you had coughed up the\nblood and your father was planning to rush you to hospital, but got caught on\nthe way there. That then brought up that you were supposedly ill with just a\nbit of vomiting from a school bug, proven by your mom going to pharmacy to pick\nup the tablets. However, he then asked if they had found the tablets in the\nhouse. They said yes, but hadn\u2019t actually tested them. Turns out they were\nactually mild poison. It was all planned. You were ill, a bug probably passed\naround at your school, and they used it to their advantage. While it was\nprogress, Steve still felt awful about the whole thing. He instructed an\ninvestigation on the pharmacist who sold the drugs, only to find out that he\nhad been hired a week before hand, and left 5 weeks after your disappearance.\nThere was no doubt he was with HYDRA, hired purely to make sure you got worse\nso your dad would take you to the hospital, and on the way they could attack.\nYour mom had left early, due to your dad calling to tell her about your\ncondition. <i>They\u2019d used you, a child, as\nleverage. And that infuriated him. </i></p><p>The case went cold again after that, but it bothered Steve\nevery day. He looked at your case every day, looking for something he could\nhave missed. Eventually he realised that there was nothing else he could do\nwithout searching each and every HYDRA base and their files, or to imprison and\ntorture a HYDRA agent until they spilled, but he didn\u2019t want to be like them,\nso he chose the first option.</p><p>He was on another mission. SHIELD had found a base, so they\nsent Steve, Tony, Clint and Natasha to deal with it properly. They were having\nto move fast to get in before the group could destroy evidence, both inanimate\nand alive. \u201cTony, go from above, Clint, get to the second level, Natasha you\u2019re\nfirst.\u201d Steve ordered, throwing his shield to hit some agents with guns,\npunching through them and grabbing his shield again to proceed with Natasha\nthrough the first floor. Natasha went forward, dealing with the agents who\nhadn\u2019t surrendered, while Steve noticed a door to the left. He got a bad- an\nawful feeling about that door, so he raised his shield, heading over to the\ndoor slowly. He could feel the agents all staring at him, and he knew that they\nwere hiding something behind that door. </p><p>He opened it, finding stairs. \u201cI\u2019m heading down here\nNatasha, secure this place, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d Steve announced. Natasha only\nnodded as she worked in handcuffing the multitude of agents, before Steve\njogged down the stairs. </p><p>He came to a room, both sides of the room occupied with\ncells with the wall made of glass to show everything inside. They left only a\nnarrow hallway for Steve to walk passed, and he realised what was going on, and\nit made him sick. The rooms were clouded with some green gas, and he could see\nbodies of people pressed up against the glass, not moving. This gas was\npoisonous, and they\u2019d been killed. He walked passed them all, looking at each\nuntil he froze at one. The body, while curled up, could be made out as Agent\nL/N, her face etched into madness and pain, but eyes dull and skin pale.\n\u201cShit\u2026\u201d He almost didn\u2019t want to turn, but had to, seeing her husband in the\nopposite cell in a similar state. He felt everything he\u2019d been trying to do for\nall those years on the case were for nothing, and it made him feel more angry\nthat he\u2019ll never know what HYDRA wanted from them or what they did to you\u2026\nwait, where we you? </p><p>His eyes shifted, seeing only two more cells. The one next\nto your father was filled with the clouded poison, and he was worried that he\nhad found you\u2026 but the body was too big. He walked a little further, looking\ninto the last cell\u2026 and he saw you. </p><p>You\u2019d given up. You were curled up, sat against the wall\nwith your head in your knees, your back jolting lightly occasionally. You were\ncrying. It tore Steve up, but also gave him hope. He had to get you out of\nhere. He could see your cell clearly, seeing the ventilation, knowing they\ncould fill the room and kill you at any second. He tightened his grip on his\nshield, pulling his arm back and hitting hit against the glass. </p><p>You jumped at the sound, away from the glass, seeing the man\nwith a shield who had managed to crack the glass, though it didn\u2019t shatter. You\nlooked at him like he was the first human you\u2019d seen in years, before snapping\nout of your moment when a hissing sound released from behind you. You looked\nback, seeing green smoke emerging from the vents. You knew what it was, and\nscrambled up, hitting the glass as well. \u201cPlease! Please!\u201d You begged\ndesperately. Steve took another swing at the glass, though it still wouldn\u2019t\nshatter. You started to cough, the feeling of light headedness and tiredness\nfilling your body. Your punches to the glass became weaker, until you fell to\nyour knees. Steve continued to try and break the glass. </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d Tony asked after regrouping. The raid was a\nsuccess, and they had all met on the first floor to hold all the surrendered.\nNatasha was about to answer when she heard the shatter of glass. They all\nlooked at the door, starting to see faint green smoke emerging from it. They\nstarted to approach until Steve emerged, running out. </p><p>\u201cShut the door!\u201d He demanded. \u00a0Clint rushed over, slamming it shut, stopping\nany more smoke. Steve had rushed past them, not giving them time to look at\nwhat he was holding tightly as he cleared a table of the things on it, gently\nlaying you down on it. </p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Natasha commented, rushing over, with Tony and\nClint not far behind, soon surrounding you with Steve. \u201cThat\u2019s the kid from the\ncase you\u2019ve been working on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N. Their name is Y/N\u2026\u201d Steve told her, though he was more\nfocussed on you. You weren\u2019t breathing, and you were growing paler and paler.\nHe pressed his head to your chest, listening intently, before pulling away,\nputting his hand on top of his other, curling the fingers into the palm of his\nother hand, and starting to press hard and fast on your chest. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened down there?\u201d Clint asked.</p><p>\u201cThey were in a holding cell\u2026 they were trying to get rid of\nthe evidence by killing them. Agent L/N and her husband are dead, Y/N was the\nonly one not dead down there when I arrived. The toxic gas they used to kill\nthem was being pumped in as I was smashing the glass.\u201d Steve explained,\ncontinuing to press on your chest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll alert base, Nat, prep the jet, Clint, get it right\noutside.\u201d Tony took charge, his two other teammates doing as told while Tony\nfocussed on alerting SHIELD on Steve finding you, and needing back up to move\nthe surrendered due to you now being a top priority on this mission. Steve was\ndeaf and blind to it all, solely focussed the 14 year old in front of him who\nwas relying on him. He eventually saw your throat move, taking in air, and he\nquickly pressed his ear to your chest again, squeezing his eyes shut and just\npraying for a heartbeat. He sighed with relief at the gentle thump he heard.</p><p>Clint got the jet right outside the main doors as the\nretrieval team arrived, and they were off back to base as the surrendered were\nbeing rounded up and arrested. The flight was deathly silent. Clint and Natasha\nflew the jet, leaving Tony and Steve with you. Tony only watched as Steve took\ncomplete control over your care. He had you on his lap, still cradling you in a\nblanket, and Tony was wondering if he saw a 14 year old teenager, or the 8 year\nold missing child that he\u2019d been torturing himself be seeing day in, day out. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen to the kid?\u201d Tony asked, looking over\nat Clint and Natasha. There was a second of silence, only prolonged when they\nfelt the eyes of Steve as well. Eventually Clint sighed, and spoke up.</p><p>\u201cChildren of dead agents aren\u2019t uncommon, and usually if the\nagent dies, we provide the financial support for that child and their parent or\nguardian until that kid\u2019s 18, like child support\u2026 However, they\u2019ve lost both\nparents, but they\u2019re still under the protection of SHIELD because of their mom\u2026\nI dunno, maybe put them in a foster family with another agent or-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll adopt them.\u201d Both Clint and Natasha took their eyes\naway from flying to look back at Steve in shock. Steve however, didn\u2019t seem\nphased by his own words, still focussed on you, the kid in his lap was still\nsick and in need of urgent care. \u201cYou do it Clint, so I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t.\nI\u2019ve been looking for this kid since I joined SHIELD, and I wasn\u2019t able to save\ntheir parents, but I can still save them.\u201d He explained. </p><p>Every agent who was involved in your case, including Maria\nand Fury themselves came to see your arrival. They were hoping for a healthy\nkid and two parents, and frowned when they saw Steve carrying you, wrapped in a\nblanket and only followed by his team. He looked up at Maria, who nodded and\nled him to the medical bay, while the rest of the team stayed behind to tell\nFury of Steve\u2019s request.</p><p>With some simple medication, oxygen mask and a little rest,\nyou were as right as rain. Steve stayed by your side till you were healthy\nenough to be woken up, and it was pretty reassuring to see the man who saved\nyou there, waiting. \u201cHello.\u201d You greeted, making the man smile. </p><p>\u201cHi Y/N. I\u2019m Steve.\u201d He greeted you back. He spent the next\nfew days just talking with you none stop. By the end of the first day, he knew\nyour favourite food, colour, and by the end of the third he got a good read on\nyour personality. Fury had agreed to let Steve adopt you, but only with your\npermission. He brought it up on the 5<sup>th </sup>day, and by the end of the\nweek, you\u2019d left the hospital to go live in a tower full of superheroes with a\nman determined to be the best dad he can be to you. You knew you were in good\nhands and that you were safe now. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

And that infuriated him. </i></p><p>The case went cold again after that, but it bothered Steve\nevery day. He looked at your case every day, looking for something he could\nhave missed. Eventually he realised that there was nothing else he could do\nwithout searching each and every HYDRA base and their files, or to imprison and\ntorture a HYDRA agent until they spilled, but he didn&rsquo;t want to be like them,\nso he chose the first option.</p><p>He was on another mission. SHIELD had found a base, so they\nsent Steve, Tony, Clint and Natasha to deal with it properly. They were having\nto move fast to get in before the group could destroy evidence, both inanimate\nand alive. &ldquo;Tony, go from above, Clint, get to the second level, Natasha you&rsquo;re\nfirst.&rdquo; Steve ordered, throwing his shield to hit some agents with guns,\npunching through them and grabbing his shield again to proceed with Natasha\nthrough the first floor. Natasha went forward, dealing with the agents who\nhadn&rsquo;t surrendered, while Steve noticed a door to the left. He got a bad- an\nawful feeling about that door, so he raised his shield, heading over to the\ndoor slowly. He could feel the agents all staring at him, and he knew that they\nwere hiding something behind that door. </p><p>He opened it, finding stairs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading down here\nNatasha, secure this place, I&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo; Steve announced. Natasha only\nnodded as she worked in handcuffing the multitude of agents, before Steve\njogged down the stairs. </p><p>He came to a room, both sides of the room occupied with\ncells with the wall made of glass to show everything inside. They left only a\nnarrow hallway for Steve to walk passed, and he realised what was going on, and\nit made him sick. The rooms were clouded with some green gas, and he could see\nbodies of people pressed up against the glass, not moving. This gas was\npoisonous, and they&rsquo;d been killed. He walked passed them all, looking at each\nuntil he froze at one. The body, while curled up, could be made out as Agent\nL/N, her face etched into madness and pain, but eyes dull and skin pale.\n&ldquo;Shit&hellip;&rdquo; He almost didn&rsquo;t want to turn, but had to, seeing her husband in the\nopposite cell in a similar state. He felt everything he&rsquo;d been trying to do for\nall those years on the case were for nothing, and it made him feel more angry\nthat he&rsquo;ll never know what HYDRA wanted from them or what they did to you&hellip;\nwait, where we you? </p><p>His eyes shifted, seeing only two more cells. The one next\nto your father was filled with the clouded poison, and he was worried that he\nhad found you&hellip; but the body was too big. He walked a little further, looking\ninto the last cell&hellip; and he saw you. </p><p>You&rsquo;d given up. You were curled up, sat against the wall\nwith your head in your knees, your back jolting lightly occasionally. You were\ncrying. It tore Steve up, but also gave him hope. He had to get you out of\nhere. He could see your cell clearly, seeing the ventilation, knowing they\ncould fill the room and kill you at any second. He tightened his grip on his\nshield, pulling his arm back and hitting hit against the glass. </p><p>You jumped at the sound, away from the glass, seeing the man\nwith a shield who had managed to crack the glass, though it didn&rsquo;t shatter. You\nlooked at him like he was the first human you&rsquo;d seen in years, before snapping\nout of your moment when a hissing sound released from behind you. You looked\nback, seeing green smoke emerging from the vents. You knew what it was, and\nscrambled up, hitting the glass as well. &ldquo;Please! Please!&rdquo; You begged\ndesperately. Steve took another swing at the glass, though it still wouldn&rsquo;t\nshatter. You started to cough, the feeling of light headedness and tiredness\nfilling your body. Your punches to the glass became weaker, until you fell to\nyour knees. Steve continued to try and break the glass. </p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Steve?&rdquo; Tony asked after regrouping. The raid was a\nsuccess, and they had all met on the first floor to hold all the surrendered.\nNatasha was about to answer when she heard the shatter of glass. They all\nlooked at the door, starting to see faint green smoke emerging from it. They\nstarted to approach until Steve emerged, running out. </p><p>&ldquo;Shut the door!&rdquo; He demanded. &nbsp;Clint rushed over, slamming it shut, stopping\nany more smoke. Steve had rushed past them, not giving them time to look at\nwhat he was holding tightly as he cleared a table of the things on it, gently\nlaying you down on it. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god.&rdquo; Natasha commented, rushing over, with Tony and\nClint not far behind, soon surrounding you with Steve. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kid from the\ncase you&rsquo;ve been working on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. Their name is Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; Steve told her, though he was more\nfocussed on you. You weren&rsquo;t breathing, and you were growing paler and paler.\nHe pressed his head to your chest, listening intently, before pulling away,\nputting his hand on top of his other, curling the fingers into the palm of his\nother hand, and starting to press hard and fast on your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell happened down there?&rdquo; Clint asked.</p><p>&ldquo;They were in a holding cell&hellip; they were trying to get rid of\nthe evidence by killing them. Agent L/N and her husband are dead, Y/N was the\nonly one not dead down there when I arrived. The toxic gas they used to kill\nthem was being pumped in as I was smashing the glass.&rdquo; Steve explained,\ncontinuing to press on your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll alert base, Nat, prep the jet, Clint, get it right\noutside.&rdquo; Tony took charge, his two other teammates doing as told while Tony\nfocussed on alerting SHIELD on Steve finding you, and needing back up to move\nthe surrendered due to you now being a top priority on this mission. Steve was\ndeaf and blind to it all, solely focussed the 14 year old in front of him who\nwas relying on him. He eventually saw your throat move, taking in air, and he\nquickly pressed his ear to your chest again, squeezing his eyes shut and just\npraying for a heartbeat. He sighed with relief at the gentle thump he heard.</p><p>Clint got the jet right outside the main doors as the\nretrieval team arrived, and they were off back to base as the surrendered were\nbeing rounded up and arrested. The flight was deathly silent. Clint and Natasha\nflew the jet, leaving Tony and Steve with you. Tony only watched as Steve took\ncomplete control over your care. He had you on his lap, still cradling you in a\nblanket, and Tony was wondering if he saw a 14 year old teenager, or the 8 year\nold missing child that he&rsquo;d been torturing himself be seeing day in, day out. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s gonna happen to the kid?&rdquo; Tony asked, looking over\nat Clint and Natasha. There was a second of silence, only prolonged when they\nfelt the eyes of Steve as well. Eventually Clint sighed, and spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Children of dead agents aren&rsquo;t uncommon, and usually if the\nagent dies, we provide the financial support for that child and their parent or\nguardian until that kid&rsquo;s 18, like child support&hellip; However, they&rsquo;ve lost both\nparents, but they&rsquo;re still under the protection of SHIELD because of their mom&hellip;\nI dunno, maybe put them in a foster family with another agent or-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll adopt them.&rdquo; Both Clint and Natasha took their eyes\naway from flying to look back at Steve in shock. Steve however, didn&rsquo;t seem\nphased by his own words, still focussed on you, the kid in his lap was still\nsick and in need of urgent care. &ldquo;You do it Clint, so I don&rsquo;t know why I can&rsquo;t.\nI&rsquo;ve been looking for this kid since I joined SHIELD, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to save\ntheir parents, but I can still save them.&rdquo; He explained. </p><p>Every agent who was involved in your case, including Maria\nand Fury themselves came to see your arrival. They were hoping for a healthy\nkid and two parents, and frowned when they saw Steve carrying you, wrapped in a\nblanket and only followed by his team. He looked up at Maria, who nodded and\nled him to the medical bay, while the rest of the team stayed behind to tell\nFury of Steve&rsquo;s request.</p><p>With some simple medication, oxygen mask and a little rest,\nyou were as right as rain. Steve stayed by your side till you were healthy\nenough to be woken up, and it was pretty reassuring to see the man who saved\nyou there, waiting. &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; You greeted, making the man smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi Y/N. I&rsquo;m Steve.&rdquo; He greeted you back. He spent the next\nfew days just talking with you none stop. By the end of the first day, he knew\nyour favourite food, colour, and by the end of the third he got a good read on\nyour personality. Fury had agreed to let Steve adopt you, but only with your\npermission. He brought it up on the 5<sup>th </sup>day, and by the end of the\nweek, you&rsquo;d left the hospital to go live in a tower full of superheroes with a\nman determined to be the best dad he can be to you. You knew you were in good\nhands and that you were safe now. </p><hr /><p>Hope you like it!

Als er auf meine Antwort Sport erwiderte, dass dies bei NOIZZ keine gro\u00dfe Rolle spielen w\u00fcrde, stieg meine Motivation nicht gerade ins Unendliche.</p><p>Trotzdem bekam ich die Gelegenheit, einige St\u00fccke rund um die Leibes\u00fcbungen zu schreiben, tobte mich aber auch auf anderen Gebieten aus. Hier eine kleine Auswahl:</p><h2>Filmkritiken</h2><p>F\u00fcr die Avengers, Solo und Deadpool w\u00e4re ich eh ins Kino gegangen.

Diese Film schon vor dem offiziellen Start sehen zu k&ouml;nnen, war ein nettes Schmankerl. Da schrieben sich die Kritiken fast von alleine. Ich hatte zwar die Bef&uuml;rchtung als Fan aller drei Filmreihen etwas zu euphorisch zu werden, doch zumindest bei Solo war diese Sorge unangebracht. Der Streifen war einfach zu schlecht, um ihn &uuml;ber den gr&uuml;nen Klee zu loben.<br /></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://noizz.de/entertainment/deadpool-2-ist-marvels-meisterwerk/ejqmw5k\">&bdquo;Deadpool 2&ldquo; ist Marvels Meisterwerk</a><br /></li></ul><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><ul><li><a href=\"https://noizz.de/entertainment/der-neue-star-wars-film-solo-fuhlt-sich-an-wie-ein-luckenfuller/e1c15tx?placement=WidgetSeeAlsoExtended&amp;position=22\">Der neue Star-Wars-Film &ldquo;Solo&rdquo; f&uuml;hlt sich an wie ein L&uuml;ckenf&uuml;ller</a><br /></li></ul><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><ul><li><a href=\"https://noizz.de/entertainment/5-grunde-warum-infinity-war-der-beste-marvel-film-aller-zeiten-ist/91plkpb?placement=WidgetSeeAlsoExtended&amp;position=50\">5 Gr&uuml;nde, warum &bdquo;Infinity War&ldquo; der beste Marvel-Film aller Zeiten ist</a><br /></li></ul><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Zwar kein Film aber auch dem Genre Unterhaltung zugeh&ouml;rig war meine <a href=\"https://noizz.de/entertainment/die-absetzung-von-lucifer-schickt-mich-in-den-kalten-entzug/bc08v27?placement=WidgetSeeAlsoExtended&amp;position=26\">Kritik an der Absetzung von Lucifer</a>.

He sat at his desk in his room, his fingers were\nconstantly tapping the wood of the table. Peter looked at his phone for the\nthird time in this minute. Still thirty minutes until Y/N would come to visit\nhim. Peter wasn&rsquo;t even sure if Y/N was going to come. He hadn&rsquo;t read Peter&rsquo;s\nmessage yet. It wasn&rsquo;t unusual that Y/N didn&rsquo;t read his messages. He was pretty\nbusy and didn&rsquo;t have time for his boyfriend the whole day. Peter understood\nthat, but he still wanted to see Y/N as often as possible. And especially today\nit was really important to him to see Y/N, or he\u2019d never be brave enough to\ntell his boyfriend the truth.</p><p>Peter\ndecided that it didn&rsquo;t make any sense to keep studying. He couldn&rsquo;t concentrate\nanyway, so he threw his pen on the table, when he heard the notification sound\nof his phone. </p><p>A message\nfrom Y/N. He opened it with shaking hands. </p><p><b>Y/N</b>: K, I&rsquo;m gonna be there in a few</p><p><b>Peter</b>: How long? </p><p><b>Y/N</b>: Not sure yet. You can be lucky that I read\nyour message now that I&rsquo;m near your house</p><p><b>Y/N</b>: Five minutes and I&rsquo;m there </p><p>Five\nminutes. Peter sighed in relieve. His joy didn&rsquo;t last long, it changed into\nfear really quickly. What was he going to say? How would Y/N react? Peter had\nbeen keeping his identity a secret from his boyfriend for such a long time now!\nWould Y/N be mad at Peter for not telling him? </p><p>Aunt May&rsquo;s\nvoice got his attention. <br/>\n&ldquo;Peter! Your boyfriend is here!&rdquo; Peter jumped up and ran to the door to pull\nY/N into a tight hug. Y/N stumbled and laughed. <br/>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting like we haven&rsquo;t seen each other in years,&rdquo; he said, and Peter\nlet go off him. Peter scraped the back of his head. <br/>\n&ldquo;Sometimes it feels like that,&rdquo; he mumbled and looked down. Y/N laughed and\nwas going to respond, but aunt May cleared her throat and announced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngoing to the shops in a few minutes. Do you guys need anything?&rdquo; Peter shook\nhis head. <br/>\n&ldquo;No, thanks May.&rdquo; <br/>\nHis aunt nodded and took her jacket. Peter grabbed his Y/N&rsquo;s hand and pulled him\nto his room. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nokay Peter?&rdquo; Y/N asked after he sat down on Peter&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;You are behaving\nreally weird.&rdquo; Y/N sounded worried, but Peter tried to laugh it off. <br/>\n&ldquo;What are you talking about? I&rsquo;m good. Everything&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; He said, but he\nwasn&rsquo;t able to convince Y/N. <br/>\n&ldquo;Peter. What&rsquo;s going on? Tell me! Did I do something wrong?&rdquo; <br/>\nPeter sighed and shook his head. <br/>\n&ldquo;No. No, it&rsquo;s not you. It&rsquo;s something different,&rdquo; he admitted. Y/N furrowed\nhis brows in concern, and put his hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. <br/>\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to talk about it, if you don\u2019t want to,&rdquo; Y/N said, but Peter\nshook his head. He pushed his boyfriend&rsquo;s hand off his shoulder and stood up.\nHe walked towards the door and assured that his aunt wasn&rsquo;t home anymore. Y/N\nwatched every single of his movements carefully. <br/>\n&ldquo;Peter&hellip;&rdquo; He whispered, but he was cut off. <br/>\n&ldquo;Y/N, I have something to tell you,&rdquo; Peter started and took a deep breath.\n&ldquo;I have a secret I&rsquo;ve never told you about. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how you would react.\nPlease, don&rsquo;t be mad at me. Promise?&rdquo; Y/N nodded without saying anything. <br/>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Spider-Man.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s heart stopped when the words left his mouth. Y/N\nsat there in silence, looking at his boyfriend. Peter avoided his gaze. Was he\nmad?<br/>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Spider-Man,&rdquo; Y/N said a few seconds later. It wasn&rsquo;t a question and\nsounded more like a simple statement. Peter nodded. <br/>\n&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N let out\na small laughter. <br/>\n&ldquo;Impossible. Like the one time I dreamed of you taking the mask off? That was\nreal?&rdquo; He asked. Peter nodded again. <br/>\n&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br/>\nY/N laughed loudly and threw his head back. <br/>\n&ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s heart dropped. <br/>\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo; he whispered. <br/>\n&ldquo;Prove it. You&rsquo;ll only get a kiss if you can,&rdquo; Y/N giggled. <br/>\n&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; was all Peter said before he took the suit Tony Stark made for him out\nof his closet. He undressed himself and dressed in the red suit. Y/N watched\nhim, his mouth was slightly open. Once Peter had pulled the mask over his head,\nhis boyfriend shook his head in disbelief. <br/>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still dreaming. That&rsquo;s not happening,&rdquo; Y/N muttered and covered his eyes\nwith his hands. Peter took his boyfriend&rsquo;s wrists and put his hands down again.\n<br/>\n&ldquo;Come on, Y/N/N.&rdquo; <br/>\n&ldquo;Where did you get this from?&rdquo;, Y/N asked and pointed on the suit. <br/>\n&ldquo;Tony Stark made it for me,&rdquo; Peter answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing this internship, you\nknow?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;How could I not know? You&rsquo;re talking about it all the time,&rdquo; Y/N pointed\nout. &ldquo;So this is what you are doing there all the time? What can you do with\nthe suit?&rdquo; Peter chuckled. <br/>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you ask.&rdquo; In the next moment, Peter was hanging upside-down from\nthe ceiling. Y/N let out a soft <i>Wow</i>. <br/>\n&ldquo;I can shoot webs and stuff-&rdquo; Peter shot at the window. &ldquo;I can walk on the\nceiling. Pretty cool, huh?&rdquo; Y/N nodded, his mouth was still open.<br/>\n&ldquo;How did you become Spider-Man?&rdquo; He asked after he found his ability to speak.\n<br/>\n&ldquo;A radioactive spider bit me,&rdquo; Peter answered and shrugged like it was\nnothing special. <br/>\n&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t go to the doctor or anything?&rdquo; There was worry in Y/N&rsquo;s\nvoice. Peter ignored the question. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nbelieve me now?&rdquo; He wanted to know and pulled his mask off. Y/N stood up from\nthe bed and walked towards Peter. He ran his fingertips over the red fabric of\nthe suit. Peter&rsquo;s eyes followed his boyfriend&rsquo;s hands and he smiled softly.<br/>\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Y/N whispered and Peter sighed in relieve. <br/>\n&ldquo;Are you going to kiss me now?&rdquo; Peter chuckled and Y/N laughed. <br/>\n&ldquo;Dream on, Parker!&rdquo; But he kissed him anyway.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"373\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"peters-holland:R43pKIaDGgHaO_RBtIRqDA:Zy8R_Z2Xtb5Go\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"373\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"peters-holland:R43pKIaDGgHaO_RBtIRqDA:Zy8R_Z2Xtb5Go\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure>",
