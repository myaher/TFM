But he wasn&rsquo;t alone, all those who had disappeared were here fighting with Thanos and his army. You wanted to fight with them, but you had a mission, to prevent Thanos from taking the stones and your only option was to send them to the past. <br/>&ldquo;Scott&rdquo; you yell, getting his attention &ldquo;your van with the portal, where is it?&rdquo; He looks at the glove and then at you, he seems to understand what you need it for &ldquo;put it in motion and give me a signal when it&rsquo;s ready&rdquo; and he nods before running to his van. You were distracted waiting for the signal when an alien is thrown against you but before you have time to react the alien was dead in the ground. Then you see it, you see him. He was the same as five years ago in Wakanda<br/>&ldquo;I always have to be watching your back&rdquo; Bucky says excited to see you &ldquo;and you still owe me a cake&rdquo; he smiles.<br/>&ldquo;Try not to disappear this time and I will make you one&rdquo; you wink at him but then you hear Scott&rsquo;s signal, making you come back to reality &ldquo;duty calls me&rdquo; and you start to run to Scott. Some aliens try to attack you but you get rid of them, it seems that you were about to get to Scott when you feel an impact on your back that throws you to the ground. You see blood on the ground, your blood, When you look up you find Thanos smiling at you.<br/>&ldquo;I will enjoy completely eliminating your little planet&rdquo; Thanos says raising his double-edged sword , that&rsquo;s how you were going to die, at least you&rsquo;ve been able to see your friends one last time, but then Mjolnir strikes him away from you. You expect to see Thor wielding it but it is not him, if not Steve who wields it and a wave of pride runs through your body. Steve is fighting with him to keep him away from you, this is your chance, but there are more and more aliens between you and the portal in Scott&rsquo;s car.<br/>&ldquo;i can&rsquo;t do this alone&rdquo; you say thinking aloud.<br/>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not alone&rdquo; Carol had returned at the best time and behind her were more women ready to fight.</p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a773c202b349f0c7deb298fe34be4519/tumblr_inline_pra8rcOcwX1s3c2y7_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><br/>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s teach them how girls fight&rdquo; you say rising from the ground and cleaning the blood from your head.

Carol fights against Thanos but he finally gets the glove, he was about to snap his fingers when Tony throws himself at him. Your heart stops when Thanos throws him into the air. You run to Tony but instead of pain, you see him smile with the stones in his power, he had stolen them. Tony introduces them in his suit and you know what he is prepared to do, but the most important thing is that you know what it will cost him to do it.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Iron Man&rdquo; Tony says and suddenly comes into your head the interview where he said the same phrase discovering his identity,and then he snaps his fingers making Thanos and his entire army disappear. You can&rsquo;t help but smile when you see him disappear but that smile disappears when you see Tony fall to the ground lifeless. Tony had given his life to save everyone.</p><p>The funeral was beautiful, you were all broken, especially Steve.<br/>&ldquo;hey babe&rdquo; You sit by his side, Sam had let you stay at his house since your home, the headquarters, was nothing but rubble &ldquo;are you okay?&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone&rdquo; he says almost in a whisper &ldquo;I told him years ago that he wasn&rsquo;t a hero, that he would never sacrifice himself, but he did&hellip;&rdquo; tears fall down his face.<br/>&ldquo;hey&hellip;He knows how important he was to you&rdquo; you say \u00a0taking away his tears.<br/>&ldquo;how are you feeling? your ribs still hurt?&rdquo; he says looking at the bruise on your cheek.<br/>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m fine&hellip; but i need to talk to you&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;Tony&hellip; he told me where you went to get the stones&hellip;New Jersey 1970&rdquo; You have been avoiding this conversation with him, but you needed to know the truth &ldquo;was she there?&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t need to say the name, he knows who you&rsquo;re talking about.<br/>&ldquo;yes&rdquo; he simply says.<br/>&ldquo;There is still a bottle of particles, you could go back to the past and finally have your dance with her, have the life you had always wanted to have&rdquo; You say taking it out of your pocket &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always known that she was your first love&rdquo; you put the jar with the particles in his hand. <br/>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asks confused.<br/>&ldquo;give you the opportunity to have what you always wanted&rdquo; You say trying to hold back the tears.<br/>&ldquo;what i always wanted? i told you that i wanted a life with you&rdquo; Steve says without being able to believe what you were offering him.<br/>&ldquo;That was before you could have the life you lost with her, Steve&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re right, a part of me has always wanted to be able to go back and be with her&rdquo; those words hurt you more than the blows of the battle &ldquo;Do you want to know what I felt when I saw her? happiness&rdquo; he says without looking away &ldquo;She was the director of Shield, she&rsquo;s going to have a family, I was happy for her, but never, not even one&rsquo;s, it has crossed my mind to be with her, I just want to be with you, you say that now I have the opportunity to return, but I don&rsquo;t want to, I just want the life that I promised you, a house far from the city, maybe close to Tony and Pepper&rsquo;s, to have a family with you, that&rsquo;s the only thing I want&rdquo; He says caressing your face &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I made you feel that you weren&rsquo;t everything to me, but believe me you are&rdquo; he kisses you with passion, letting you know how much he loves you. You have always felt Peggy&rsquo;s shadow in your relationship with Steve and now that he had the opportunity to choose, he chose you, eliminating all the doubts and insecurities that you had.<br/>&ldquo;i love you&rdquo; you say looking him in the eyes.<br/>&ldquo;i love you 3000&rdquo; he says to you, making you smile. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Five years later&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"332\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40028965b6f5c43c3e853d079b8e5972/tumblr_inline_pra8i3BtjV1s3c2y7_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"332\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>You were cooking when Steve hugs you from behind and gives you a kiss on the neck.<br/>&ldquo;are they here?&rdquo; You say turning around to see Steve.<br/>&ldquo;They just arrived, Nat is already playing with Morgan in the barn&rdquo; he explains.<br/>&ldquo;Have you left them alone?&rdquo; you say with reproach.<br/>&ldquo;Happy is with them don&rsquo;t worry, Pepper couldn&rsquo;t stay, she had an important meeting, but she&rsquo;ll come to dinner&rdquo; Steve informs you.<br/>&ldquo;perfect, I&rsquo;m going to finish preparing the food, you should go and see what these little ones are doing with Happy, last time they locked him in the attic&rdquo; you say trying to hide your smile, you found him five hours later.<br/>&ldquo;yeah your right, If I don&rsquo;t come back in an hour, come and get me okay?&rdquo; he jokes giving you a kiss on the forehead.<br/>&ldquo;sure&hellip; love you&rdquo; you say smiling.<br/>&ldquo;love you 3000&rdquo; \u00a0he always says that and you love it.

You didn\u2019t realize you were crying until you felt the tears fall on your face, but this time they were tears of happiness, but you should already know, happiness doesn\u2019t usually last long.</p><p>Everyone around you was happy, finally, this was over but then there is a big explosion that makes the ground give way, and then everything turns black.<br>When you open your eyes, everything is blurred, there is a lot of smoke and dirt everywhere. There is something heavy on top of you that makes it difficult for you to breathe, a body. <br>\u201cSteve?\u201d you say trying to move him \u201cSteve\u201d Is he alive? he had protected you with his body \u201cplease Steve you can\u2019t be dead\u201d and then you notice how his body moves<br>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asks, examining you with his eyes looking for serious injuries.<br>\u201ci\u2019m okay\u201d you say before kissing him.<br>\u201clovebirds, what if we leave that for later?

You don\u2019t need Clint to repeat it to you, you start running with the glove. Clint starts throwing arrows creating explosions to gain time as he runs behind you. when finally you come to the surface you can see what little remains of your home, and the person responsible of that fighting with the love of your life. But he wasn\u2019t alone, all those who had disappeared were here fighting with Thanos and his army. You wanted to fight with them, but you had a mission, to prevent Thanos from taking the stones and your only option was to send them to the past. <br>\u201cScott\u201d you yell, getting his attention \u201cyour van with the portal, where is it?\u201d He looks at the glove and then at you, he seems to understand what you need it for \u201cput it in motion and give me a signal when it\u2019s ready\u201d and he nods before running to his van. You were distracted waiting for the signal when an alien is thrown against you but before you have time to react the alien was dead in the ground. Then you see it, you see him.

Some aliens try to attack you but you get rid of them, it seems that you were about to get to Scott when you feel an impact on your back that throws you to the ground. You see blood on the ground, your blood, When you look up you find Thanos smiling at you.<br>\u201cI will enjoy completely eliminating your little planet\u201d Thanos says raising his double-edged sword , that\u2019s how you were going to die, at least you\u2019ve been able to see your friends one last time, but then Mjolnir strikes him away from you. You expect to see Thor wielding it but it is not him, if not Steve who wields it and a wave of pride runs through your body. Steve is fighting with him to keep him away from you, this is your chance, but there are more and more aliens between you and the portal in Scott\u2019s car.<br>\u201ci can\u2019t do this alone\u201d you say thinking aloud.<br>\u201cyou\u2019re not alone\u201d Carol had returned at the best time and behind her were more women ready to fight.</p><p><br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a773c202b349f0c7deb298fe34be4519/tumblr_inline_pra8rcOcwX1s3c2y7_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><br>\u201cLet\u2019s teach them how girls fight\u201d you say rising from the ground and cleaning the blood from your head.

A second later you appear back to the present, in the past, hours have passed, but in the present it has only been a few seconds. You feel relief when you see Tony and Steve by your side. <br />&ldquo;we did it&rdquo; Steve says almost unable to believe it. But something wasn&rsquo;t right, Natasha wasn&rsquo;t here.<br />&ldquo;Clint&hellip; where is she? where&rsquo;s Nat?&rdquo; you ask him without wanting to know the answer, because if she wasn&rsquo;t here &hellip;<br />&ldquo;she&rsquo;s gone&hellip; she sacrificed himself to get the stone&rdquo; Clint says with tears in his eyes.<br />&ldquo;no&hellip;&rdquo; you say and Steve surrounds you with his arms. <br />&ldquo;her sacrifice won&rsquo;t be in vain&rdquo; he says in a broken voice &ldquo;Bruce, Tony get the glove for the stones, lets do this&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce is the one who decides to wear the glove and activate the stones, he has the best chance of surviving, and he almost died but as soon as he &nbsp;activates them, Clint&rsquo;s wife calls him, letting you know that everyone was back, you did it, they are back. You didn&rsquo;t realize you were crying until you felt the tears fall on your face, but this time they were tears of happiness, but you should already know, happiness doesn&rsquo;t usually last long.</p><p>Everyone around you was happy, finally, this was over but then there is a big explosion that makes the ground give way, and then everything turns black.<br />When you open your eyes, everything is blurred, there is a lot of smoke and dirt everywhere. There is something heavy on top of you that makes it difficult for you to breathe, a body. <br />&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; you say trying to move him &ldquo;Steve&rdquo; Is he alive? he had protected you with his body &ldquo;please Steve you can&rsquo;t be dead&rdquo; and then you notice how his body moves<br />&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; He asks, examining you with his eyes looking for serious injuries.<br />&ldquo;i&rsquo;m okay&rdquo; you say before kissing him.<br />&ldquo;lovebirds, what if we leave that for later? There&rsquo;s a purple alien up there&rdquo; Tony says approaching you. Thor appears behind Tony ready for the battle.<br />&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take care of Thanos, look for the stones, they have to be among the rubble and keep them away from the battle&rdquo; Steve kisses you one last time before running off to battle.</p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d20abc1dba29581af95b54c653f8e87/tumblr_inline_pra8ouwAXu1s3c2y7_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br /></p><p>You were looking for the glove with the stones when Clint appears &ldquo;Clint, Are you okay? i was looking for that&rdquo; Apparently Clint had found the stones.<br />&ldquo;yeahhh all yours&rdquo; &nbsp;He throws at you the glove &ldquo;now run&rdquo; and then you see them, the tunnel you were in was filling up with aliens looking for the stones. You don&rsquo;t need Clint to repeat it to you, you start running with the glove. Clint starts throwing arrows creating explosions to gain time as he runs behind you. when finally you come to the surface you can see what little remains of your home, and the person responsible of that fighting with the love of your life. But he wasn&rsquo;t alone, all those who had disappeared were here fighting with Thanos and his army. You wanted to fight with them, but you had a mission, to prevent Thanos from taking the stones and your only option was to send them to the past. <br />&ldquo;Scott&rdquo; you yell, getting his attention &ldquo;your van with the portal, where is it?&rdquo; He looks at the glove and then at you, he seems to understand what you need it for &ldquo;put it in motion and give me a signal when it&rsquo;s ready&rdquo; and he nods before running to his van. You were distracted waiting for the signal when an alien is thrown against you but before you have time to react the alien was dead in the ground. Then you see it, you see him. He was the same as five years ago in Wakanda<br />&ldquo;I always have to be watching your back&rdquo; Bucky says excited to see you &ldquo;and you still owe me a cake&rdquo; he smiles.<br />&ldquo;Try not to disappear this time and I will make you one&rdquo; you wink at him but then you hear Scott&rsquo;s signal, making you come back to reality &ldquo;duty calls me&rdquo; and you start to run to Scott. Some aliens try to attack you but you get rid of them, it seems that you were about to get to Scott when you feel an impact on your back that throws you to the ground. You see blood on the ground, your blood, When you look up you find Thanos smiling at you.<br />&ldquo;I will enjoy completely eliminating your little planet&rdquo; Thanos says raising his double-edged sword , that&rsquo;s how you were going to die, at least you&rsquo;ve been able to see your friends one last time, but then Mjolnir strikes him away from you. You expect to see Thor wielding it but it is not him, if not Steve who wields it and a wave of pride runs through your body. Steve is fighting with him to keep him away from you, this is your chance, but there are more and more aliens between you and the portal in Scott&rsquo;s car.<br />&ldquo;i can&rsquo;t do this alone&rdquo; you say thinking aloud.<br />&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not alone&rdquo; Carol had returned at the best time and behind her were more women ready to fight.</p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a773c202b349f0c7deb298fe34be4519/tumblr_inline_pra8rcOcwX1s3c2y7_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s teach them how girls fight&rdquo; you say rising from the ground and cleaning the blood from your head. You all fight as a team, alien that gets in your way, alien that is destroyed, you are so close to the portal, a couple of meters left&hellip; and the car burst into flames in front of you, Thanos had destroyed it. <br />It seems that time stoped, you&rsquo;re hit again, getting away from the glove. Carol fights against Thanos but he finally gets the glove, he was about to snap his fingers when Tony throws himself at him. Your heart stops when Thanos throws him into the air. You run to Tony but instead of pain, you see him smile with the stones in his power, he had stolen them. Tony introduces them in his suit and you know what he is prepared to do, but the most important thing is that you know what it will cost him to do it.<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Iron Man&rdquo; Tony says and suddenly comes into your head the interview where he said the same phrase discovering his identity,and then he snaps his fingers making Thanos and his entire army disappear. You can&rsquo;t help but smile when you see him disappear but that smile disappears when you see Tony fall to the ground lifeless. Tony had given his life to save everyone.</p><p>The funeral was beautiful, you were all broken, especially Steve.<br />&ldquo;hey babe&rdquo; You sit by his side, Sam had let you stay at his house since your home, the headquarters, was nothing but rubble &ldquo;are you okay?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone&rdquo; he says almost in a whisper &ldquo;I told him years ago that he wasn&rsquo;t a hero, that he would never sacrifice himself, but he did&hellip;&rdquo; tears fall down his face.<br />&ldquo;hey&hellip;He knows how important he was to you&rdquo; you say &nbsp;taking away his tears.<br />&ldquo;how are you feeling? your ribs still hurt?&rdquo; he says looking at the bruise on your cheek.<br />&ldquo;i&rsquo;m fine&hellip; but i need to talk to you&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Tony&hellip; he told me where you went to get the stones&hellip;New Jersey 1970&rdquo; You have been avoiding this conversation with him, but you needed to know the truth &ldquo;was she there?&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t need to say the name, he knows who you&rsquo;re talking about.<br />&ldquo;yes&rdquo; he simply says.<br />&ldquo;There is still a bottle of particles, you could go back to the past and finally have your dance with her, have the life you had always wanted to have&rdquo; You say taking it out of your pocket &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always known that she was your first love&rdquo; you put the jar with the particles in his hand. <br />&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asks confused.<br />&ldquo;give you the opportunity to have what you always wanted&rdquo; You say trying to hold back the tears.<br />&ldquo;what i always wanted? i told you that i wanted a life with you&rdquo; Steve says without being able to believe what you were offering him.<br />&ldquo;That was before you could have the life you lost with her, Steve&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;you&rsquo;re right, a part of me has always wanted to be able to go back and be with her&rdquo; those words hurt you more than the blows of the battle &ldquo;Do you want to know what I felt when I saw her? happiness&rdquo; he says without looking away &ldquo;She was the director of Shield, she&rsquo;s going to have a family, I was happy for her, but never, not even one&rsquo;s, it has crossed my mind to be with her, I just want to be with you, you say that now I have the opportunity to return, but I don&rsquo;t want to, I just want the life that I promised you, a house far from the city, maybe close to Tony and Pepper&rsquo;s, to have a family with you, that&rsquo;s the only thing I want&rdquo; He says caressing your face &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I made you feel that you weren&rsquo;t everything to me, but believe me you are&rdquo; he kisses you with passion, letting you know how much he loves you. You have always felt Peggy&rsquo;s shadow in your relationship with Steve and now that he had the opportunity to choose, he chose you, eliminating all the doubts and insecurities that you had.<br />&ldquo;i love you&rdquo; you say looking him in the eyes.<br />&ldquo;i love you 3000&rdquo; he says to you, making you smile. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Five years later&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40028965b6f5c43c3e853d079b8e5972/tumblr_inline_pra8i3BtjV1s3c2y7_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br /></p><p>You were cooking when Steve hugs you from behind and gives you a kiss on the neck.<br />&ldquo;are they here?&rdquo; You say turning around to see Steve.<br />&ldquo;They just arrived, Nat is already playing with Morgan in the barn&rdquo; he explains.<br />&ldquo;Have you left them alone?&rdquo; you say with reproach.<br />&ldquo;Happy is with them don&rsquo;t worry, Pepper couldn&rsquo;t stay, she had an important meeting, but she&rsquo;ll come to dinner&rdquo; Steve informs you.<br />&ldquo;perfect, I&rsquo;m going to finish preparing the food, you should go and see what these little ones are doing with Happy, last time they locked him in the attic&rdquo; you say trying to hide your smile, you found him five hours later.<br />&ldquo;yeah your right, If I don&rsquo;t come back in an hour, come and get me okay?&rdquo; he jokes giving you a kiss on the forehead.<br />&ldquo;sure&hellip; love you&rdquo; you say smiling.<br />&ldquo;love you 3000&rdquo; &nbsp;he always says that and you love it.
