        "question": "I know this is probably an unpopular opinion, especially among those who still refuse to see any fault within the Jedi, but after comparing TCW and all the prequel movies together the claim that \"the Jedi defend the Republic\" cannot be held up under scrutiny. What the Jedi did was defending the \"idea\", or more cynical, the \"corpse\" of the Republic because that's what it was in essence even before the Clone Wars. It was a Republic only in name, especially once Palps got those emergency powers.",
        "answer": "<p>The majority of Jedi were idealists and ideologues who believed in preserving order and peace at the expense of individual and institutional justice. They believed in the Republic because it was the means to maintain order and peace even as this became manifestly untrue. They believed and fought for the Republic because they were genuinely afraid of what would happen to the galaxy if the Republic fell, both in terms of galactic unrest and in terms of the impact that would have on the Jedi as an institution. <br/></p><p>Those who were aware that Dooku had turned Sith were also fighting a religious war. For them, the fight against the Separatists was less about the politics of it and more about the fact that they had aligned themselves with Darkness and the ultimate evil. The Republic had to win or Darkness would rule the galaxy. I\u2019m not really sure just how many Jedi were in on the Dooku\u2019s-a-Sith thing, but knowing that he was would certainly explain why Ahsoka was so sure the Separatists were evil. I strongly suspect the Senate was never informed. <br/></p>",

                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>It wasn&rsquo;t their words, it&rsquo;s that I started to believe them.</p><p>Their words seemed to confirm what growing up as a woman and a person of color already taught me: that I belonged in margins and spaces, valid only as a minor character in their lives and stories.</p><p>And those words awakened something deep inside me &mdash; a feeling I thought I had grown out of. The same feeling I had when at 9, I stopped speaking Vietnamese altogether because I was tired of hearing other kids mock me. Or at 17, when at dinner with my white boyfriend and his family, I ordered a meal in perfect English, to the surprise of the waitress, who exclaimed, &ldquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s so cute that you have an exchange student!&rdquo;</p><p>Their words reinforced a narrative I had heard my whole life: that I was &ldquo;other,&rdquo; that I didn&rsquo;t belong, that I wasn&rsquo;t good enough, simply because I wasn&rsquo;t like them. And that feeling, I realize now, was, and is, shame, a shame for the things that made me different, a shame for the culture from which I came from. And to me, the most disappointing thing was that I felt it at all.</p><p>Because the same society that taught some people they were heroes, saviors, inheritors of the Manifest Destiny ideal, taught me I existed only in the background of their stories, doing their nails, diagnosing their illnesses, supporting their love interests &mdash; and perhaps the most damaging &mdash; waiting for them to rescue me.</p><p>And for a long time, I believed them.</p><p>Yes, I have been lied to. We all have.</p><p>And it was in this realization that I felt a different shame &mdash; not a shame for who I was, but a shame for the world I grew up in. And a shame for how that world treats anyone who is different.</p><p>I am not the first person to have grown up this way. This is what it is to grow up as a person of color in a white-dominated world. This is what it is to be a woman in a society that has taught its daughters that we are worthy of love only if we are deemed attractive by its sons. This is the world I grew up in, but not the world I want to leave behind.</p><p>I want to live in a world where children of color don&rsquo;t spend their entire adolescence wishing to be white. I want to live in a world where women are not subjected to scrutiny for their appearance, or their actions, or their general existence. I want to live in a world where people of all races, religions, socioeconomic classes, sexual orientations, gender identities and abilities are seen as what they have always been: human beings.</p><p>This is the world I want to live in. And this is the world that I will continue to work toward.</p><p>These are the thoughts that run through my head every time I pick up a script or a screenplay or a book. I know the opportunity given to me is rare. I know that I now belong to a small group of privileged people who get to tell stories for a living, stories that are heard and seen and digested by a world that for so long has tasted only one thing. I know how important that is. And I am not giving up.</p><p>You might know me as Kelly.I am the first woman of color to have a leading role in a &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; movie.</p><p>I am the first Asian woman to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair.</p><p>My real name is Loan. And I am just getting started.</p></blockquote><p>Taking this out from behind the pay wall because it deserves to be seen, and read, and acknowledged. But if you have a click to give, do that too.

This is the world I grew up in, but not the world I want to leave behind.\u201d</p> <p>Although she doesn\u2019t directly refer to the trolls who bombarded her Instagram account with hateful messages (and why should she? They don\u2019t deserve the airtime), it\u2019s clear that she was deeply affected by their missives.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2918\" data-orig-width=\"4377\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/219c5525b1b6b60bcd9675bbebdb2d6b\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41f6184603187f5304f2d3e69d0fee1d/tumblr_inline_pdtahm5yDT1uxahsv_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2918\" data-orig-width=\"4377\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/219c5525b1b6b60bcd9675bbebdb2d6b\"/></figure><figcaption>Actress Kelly Marie Tran poses for photographers upon arrival at the premiere of the film \u2018Star Wars: The Last Jedi\u2019 in London, Tuesday, Dec. 12th, 2017.

I had been tricked into thinking that my body was not my own, that I was only beautiful if someone else believed it, regardless of my own opinion. I had been told and retold this by everyone: by the media, by Hollywood, by companies that profited from my insecurities, manipulating me so that I would buy their clothes, their makeup, their shoes, in order to fill a void that was perpetuated by them in the first place.\u201d</p></blockquote> <p>Tran also talks about her parents adopting American names\u00a0\u201cso it was easier for others to pronounce\u201d, a common experience for first-generation immigrants that she describes as \u201ca literal erasure of culture\u201d that left her \u201caching to the core\u201d. This adds powerful weight to her sign-off:</p> <p>\u201cYou might know me as Kelly.</p> <p>I am the first woman of color to have a leading role in a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie.</p> <p>I am the first Asian woman to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair.</p> <p>My real name is Loan.
