Sansa deserved better. We deserved better.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Rewatching GOT season 1 and if you had told me eight years ago that this cute little Bran was going to end up being King, I would have been all for it! There was a point where I loved so many of these characters and were happy with how they were going that I would have been cool with any of them being King or Queen at the end.</p><p>Except Bran, this Bran we see at the start and who goes on his quest, is not the Bran who wins the throne. As Meera says, he dies in the cave with Summer and Hodor. An emotionless creature takes over his body and allows a city to burn to take control of the realm.</p><p>And Sansa - I don&rsquo;t say much on Sansa and I suppose, being a Dany stan, people think I hate her. Far from it. I&rsquo;ve adored watching Sansa grow and I wanted to see her be the one to bring down Cersei more so than Dany because Sansa had a history and relationship with Cersei that Dany didn&rsquo;t. I wanted her to be the Queen&nbsp;&lsquo;younger and prettier&rsquo; who takes the throne from Cersei LIKE THE SEVEN FACED GOD DAMN PROPHECY. I was cheering Sansa and Arya on when they fooled Littlefinger and when she fed Ramsey to his hounds.&nbsp;</p><p>So why aren&rsquo;t I happy that Sansa gets to be Queen of the North, which is actually just as large as the other kingdoms combined? Because, just like Bran&rsquo;s rise to the throne and Dany&rsquo;s fall to madness, it doesn&rsquo;t feel earned. And that&rsquo;s not to say we haven&rsquo;t seen glimpses of Sansa being a good ruler and caring for her people - we have - but they were glimpses, always in the background, mostly used to points of arguments between her and Dany or her and Jon. Compare the three&nbsp;&ldquo;King/Queen in the North!&rdquo; scenes. For Robb and Jon, they were chosen by their people. They made no claim or push for royalty or independence - the North loved them and chose them. But with Sansa it felt like&hellip;she was basically Queen by default as there were no males left to content with her. We don&rsquo;t see a single recognisable face at her coronation! We don&rsquo;t see anyone CHOOSING her as the Queen apart from herself and her own brother (if he&rsquo;s even still that) giving her the okay about it. Even the knight sworn to protect her has left her side! We don&rsquo;t really see Sansa do anything this season that really showed her lessons and growth be for anything heroic - aside from giving the North independence. She&rsquo;s mainly there as a rival for Dany, then not doing anything in the crypt - even at the Battle of Blackwater she was trying to keep everyones spirits up! - and then becoming an Oathbreaker and all her family leaving her again.</p><p>Tl;dr - Bran deserved better. Sansa deserved better. We deserved better.</p>",
