I can\u2019t get over how many of you were as excited for this as I am, thank you so much you lovely lovely people; hopefully it meets all of your expectations. Also as much as I love the movie version of this particular song, you\u2019re damn right I couldn\u2019t stop listening to the Panic! At the Disco version of it while writing this instead. (My bad)</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"nexttxyou:dGjp3des4aESmOKftHrd3A:ZyVqjj2YzOFFH\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b42b38b7b94de77365af452d43092808/tumblr_pah0zelXBK1udd1p0o1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i><b>\u201cWe light it up, we won\u2019t come down and the sun can\u2019t stop us now.\u201d</b></i></p><p>The sweltering heat beats through the slightly cracked open window of your stuffy LA apartment, causing you to let out an uninterested sigh. You rotate on the tacky but insanely comfy couch you managed to score at a nearby thrift shop; your hair hanging off the edge of it, with your hand pressed to your forehead as you glance at your surroundings just to feed into your boredom. Your gaze falls on the glass of water you willed yourself to get up and grab twenty minutes ago \u2013 observing as the small liquid beads of condensation form and slide their way down the sweaty looking glass, and eventually pool at the bottom of it on the small wooden coffee table. In the background, a rerun of The Office plays on the large television and just as your focus moves to Michael and Dwight driving into a lake; it\u2019s broken when the sound of your apartment door being whipped open snaps you out of your daze.</p><p>You instantly sit up from your position as a feeling of panic rises, but it soon diminishes when you see it\u2019s just your best friend of many years silently shuffling away from the now closed door towards the kitchen. Various noises of cupboard doors opening and closing, followed by a loud groan spark some curious thoughts in your mind as you enter the tiny kitchen to find him leaning forward against the counter. The way his ring-clad fingers grip tightly onto the edge of the dark granite countertop to the point that his knuckles are beginning to show tinges of white, and how his growing curls have fallen in front of his face with him making no move to brush them away has you considering your words before finally speaking up. </p><p>\u201cRough day?\u201d You ask softly and rest your head against the doorframe as you lean against it. The way his shoulders twitch as he lets out the quietest sarcastic chuckle is enough for you know that your question is quite the understatement. He remains silent as his grip on the counter visibly lightens and his intense emerald gaze falls onto you; softening the slightest bit to show the usually radiant green eyes you often find yourself lost in when looking at them. \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me much of a choice, are you?\u201d Harry asks and looks at you with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>You immediately lean away from the doorframe and bite down on your lips as you begin shaking your head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>This causes him to laugh a bit and he joins in on shaking his head as well, knowing well enough that you\u2019d get whatever\u2019s got him acting so strange out of him sooner or later. With a dramatic sigh as he pushes away from the counter and spins around to reach into the fridge that\u2019s directly behind him \u2013 wasting no time in grabbing the newly purchased bottle of wine that resides within it, making a swift move to open up the Pink Moscato Ros\u00e9 beverage and taking a large gulp. Once he\u2019s done, you find yourself trained on his lips as he licks away the small dribbles of wine that escaped the bottle before meeting his mouth; shaking your head once again as his eyes move to you and an arrogant smirk dances across those intriguing lips.</p><p>Part of you wants to make a snarky comment of how his mother raised him better than to not grab glasses for the wine you knew the two of you would be sharing later tonight anyways, but your better judgement knows that he\u2019s had a rough day and it\u2019s best if you didn\u2019t. So instead you let out a breath and hold your hand out towards him; earning yourself another chuckle from the curly haired boy as he passes you the bottle and you take a long swing as well. His eyes don\u2019t leave you as you do this, and the smirk doesn\u2019t fade from his mouth until you set\u00a0the wine onto the counter and he speaks up again. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re going to want more of that after I tell you what happened today.\u201d</p><p>The two of you spend the next hour sat on your couch as Harry repeats the day\u2019s events, and it all truly blows your mind. You never knew what you were getting yourself into when you became friends with someone who was a member of a world renown boy band, but there had always been this deep connection between you and Harry that made you inseparable and is the reason that same friendship has lasted long past his One Direction days and to the present ones. That being said, as someone who likes their privacy and tends to avoid the spotlight as much as they can; you\u2019re never truly prepared for some of the outrageous stories Harry tells that have such a large impact in his life \u2013 including the one he\u2019s just finished explaining. </p><p>\u201cOk so wait,\u201d you slur the slightest bit after finishing off the second bottle of wine you\u2019d just grabbed not that long ago. \u201cYour management team wants you to do <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a PR,\u201d he grumbles and snatches the bottle from your hands; a pout forming on his lips as he flips it upside down and nothing comes out. \u201cThink we could Uber Eats some more of this stuff? Oh, and pizza!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA PR? So, like a public romance type thing?\u201d You ask, and he scowls at you for avoiding his question. \u201cWhy? And with who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell yeh,\u201d he states as he moves to grab his phone from the coffee table and unsurprisingly opens up the Uber Eats app to order more wine and food. \u201cThey think it\u2019ll be beneficial when it comes to promoting the new album. Think it\u2019s quite stupid if m\u2019being honest. Don\u2019t really see what being in a fake relationship has to do with my music and its chances at being successful.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, and you know that Harry. Your fans are going to absolutely love anything you release for them because it\u2019s always amazing. Jeff knows that too but\u2026 who knows. This is why I could never be a celebrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah too bad you don\u2019t get to experience it all with me though, it\u2019d be much more fun if you did,\u201d he replies, and you smile to yourself over how his deep British accent becomes more prominent like it always does when he consumes more than a little bit of alcohol \u2013 however, you\u2019re so focused on those little things that you don\u2019t notice how his eyes have widened and he\u2019s staring at you with a childlike glint of excitement and his million dollar smile. </p><p>You furrow your eyebrows at him and find yourself leaning back onto the couch\u2019s armrest; glancing around behind you to see if someone else had shown up and you were too buzzed to notice because surely, he\u2019s not looking at you like that. Alas, when you realize there indeed is no one else he could possibly be looking at; you find yourself shrinking even further away from him. \u201cW-what? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything or break eye-contact as he scoots closer to you and subtly licks over his drying lips before grinning even wider. \u201cY/N, would you like to be my PR?\u201d </p><p>You can\u2019t help the snort that leaves your mouth as he asks this, and luckily the sound of someone wanting to be buzzed into your apartment building allows you to avoid the question. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d you tell him and move from your cross-legged position to stand up and grab the empty wine bottles and open bag of chips from the table; before making way to press the button on the wall that unlocks the buildings front door and place the items in the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean it as a joke,\u201d Harry\u2019s voice sounds from behind you, and you roll your eyes. \u201cKind of being serious actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I love you but there\u2019s literally no chance in hell that I\u2019d want to do that,\u201d you tell him firmly and turn around to face him standing in the doorway. </p><p>He ponders your response for a moment before shaking his head and laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d You ask incredulously, becoming defensive at his choice of words. \u201cWhat in the world makes you think I want anything to do with any of that? As my best friend I figured you\u2019d know by now how much the spotlight really does not appeal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know it doesn\u2019t, but I also know how there\u2019s a part of you deep down that\u2019s curious to see what would happen,\u201d he argues and steps into the room. He takes all of two strides to reach you, and you quickly turn to the side; your back being pressed against the counter as he very much barges into your personal space. There isn\u2019t much room to move around in the kitchen to begin with, but as Harry takes up the majority of free space between you and the other counter that is a mere two meters away; it feels so much smaller. He looks down at you intensely and you feel that he\u2019s towering over you much more than usual \u2013 finding yourself nervous with how close he is, but also not wanting him to move away. Neither of you say anything because you know what he said is true. The entire concept is pretty intriguing actually, but you refuse to allow him to have the glory in being right and getting what he wants.</p><p>Your stare down with each other continues for another moment until he starts inching closer, but you continue your silent protest \u2013 even when he leans towards you; placing his hands onto the counter on either of your waist and only stops when he\u2019s inches away from your face. If it was anyone other than Harry, you\u2019d be intimidated by such a gesture but for him it\u2019s the exact opposite. Not only are you beginning to view this is a competition that\u2019s forming between the two of you; seeing who will crumble before the other into a dusty pile of embarrassment, but you and your ruthless ass actually like the feeling \u2013 and you completely ignore the way your heart is fluttering in your chest just like the swarm of butterflies that are making their presence known in your stomach as well. </p><p>Neither of you crack nor move away until a knock sounds from the door, and even then, you still ignore it. Harry doesn\u2019t flinch in the slightest and you\u2019re determined to do the same but have to give up when there\u2019s another loud knock. Without saying a word, you slide to the left and away from him. He instantly moves his hand, so you can escape from being in such close proximity of each other, and watches as you walk towards the front door and glance over your shoulder at him with a smirk. \u201cStill not going to happen H.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come <i>on</i>,\u201d he groans and follows after you. The smug look you have on your face doesn\u2019t deteriorate as you unlock the front door and open it up to greet the Uber Eats worker standing on the other side, and Harry is behind you in an instant to continue his complaining. \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to consider it? Just going to shut the whole idea down because, because you\u2019re a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a coward,\u201d you snap, and whip your head to the side so you can glare at him over your shoulder again. \u201cNow would you shut up for just a second?\u201d</p><p>You turn around to look at the college aged boy who stares into your apartment with an awestruck expression and let out a sigh. \u201cY-You\u2019re Harry Styles,\u201d he stammers, and you move to glance between him and your best friend. Harry doesn\u2019t reply as he sends the boy a closed-mouthed smile before dragging his hand through his curls like he always does when he\u2019s stressed or aggravated in some way. You look back to the boy and quickly grab the bag of food he\u2019s holding, before he can drop it due to the lack of concentration he has on the reason he\u2019s standing at your door in the first place. </p><p>You scowl at him and your eyes widen as you notice him slowly reaching towards his pocket, where his cell phone very clearly resides and inhale a sharp breath. \u201cUh, um, thank you!\u201d You spurt out and quickly shut the door, before making sure it\u2019s locked and leaning your back against it. </p><p>Harry gives you a thankful nod, and soon goes back into arguing. \u201cWill you please consider it at least?\u201d</p><p>Your shoulders slump at his words, and you don\u2019t say anything as you push off the door to walk past him towards the couch to sit back down. \u201cWhy me of all people H? Surely there\u2019s literally anyone else who could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah but I really don\u2019t want to pretend to be in a relationship with someone I know nothing about,\u201d he explains and plops down onto his spot beside you again; wasting no time in cracking open the new bottle of wine and finding a movie to watch on Netflix. \u201cI\u2019d actually feel comfortable doing something so awkward because it wouldn\u2019t be with just anyone, it\u2019d be with my best friend. Maybe it\u2019d even be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Harry,\u201d you respond and bite down onto your lip. \u201cIt also sounds like something that could end really badly. Not to sound negative or anything but that world is such a big part of your life and I don\u2019t belong in it. Sure, people know who I am because everyone knows we\u2019re friends, but I\u2019ve always been there in the shadows. Away from the people, and away from the attention\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t know how to handle it if things were to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be there with you every step of the way Y/N,\u201d he states softly, and you let out a knowing sigh. \u201cListen, obviously I can\u2019t make you do it, but would you at least consider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I can do that,\u201d you tell him, and his dimples aren\u2019t long in being on full display. He drops the topic after that and the two of you spend the remainder of the evening watching movies and eating the cold leftover pizza, before eventually cutting yourselves off the wine once you\u2019ve finished half of the third bottle in less than twenty minutes. </p><p>Harry is the first to fall asleep with his head leant against the armrest on his end of the couch, but you lay awake thinking about what he\u2019s asked you to do and consider possible outcomes. Soon enough, you allow yourself to accept the fact that maybe it won\u2019t be as bad as you\u2019re thinking it will be, and eventually fall asleep curled up by your best friend on the opposite end of the comfortable piece of furniture. </p><p>You wake up the next morning alone in the living room and are instantly confused. Without a moment to waste, you sit up straight on the couch and take in Harry\u2019s notable absence. The throw blanket that usually stays draped over the back of chair in the corner of the room lays across your lap, and you know it was Harry that put it there. Before you become too worried as to where he could\u2019ve gone; his distinctive voice rings from behind you.</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re awake,\u201d he greets with a large dimpled grin as you turn around to see him peaking his head out from the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m making waffles.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cDid you just quote Donkey from Shrek?\u201d You groan as you stretch your arms high above your head to crack your stiff back, before reaching down to rub at your tired eyes. </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he replies. \u201cBut I actually did so come get some.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help the smile that takes over your mouth as you stand up and slowly shuffle towards the kitchen to get some of the waffles that smell really good. The small dinner table that is set against the outer wall of the kitchen is filled with various plates of fruit, toast, bacon, and eggs so naturally you have to steal one of the appetizing looking clementine\u2019s he\u2019s set out; playing catch with it a couple times until you reach the doorway. \u201cReally trying to butter me up about this whole thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He freezes in his position of holding the carton of orange juice he was preparing to pour into the two glasses he has set beside a plate stacked with toaster waffles, and slowly moves his gaze to you. \u201cI- ok yeah. I thought-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do this Harry,\u201d you cut him off and try to ignore the butterflies that are fluttering in your stomach again. </p><p>\u201cI know but I wanted to do something nice because I really am asking a lot from you to do this whole thing, and m\u2019not going to be mad if you say no or anything seeing as you\u2019d literally have to pretend to be in a relationship with me but-,\u201d he mindlessly rambles but stops when you step forward and cut him off for a second time. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He looks at you in pure shock before he sets down the juice, and his expression melts into the all too familiar grin that you love so much. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you tell him while nodding your head and smiling widely. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be\u2026 fun. And what kind of friend would I be if I let you pretend to be in a relationship with someone you can\u2019t stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst kind,\u201d he replies jokingly before taking a couple strides and engulfing you into a tight hug. \u201cThank you, Y/N. Really. You don\u2019t know how much that means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I can help,\u201d you respond and lean into his chest. The two of you stay like that for a moment before realizing just exactly what is going on, and both slowly move away. You can\u00a0feel the elephant that\u2019s beginning to form in the room and are quick in changing the subject to avoid any further awkwardness. \u201cOk now I\u2019m ready for all this food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDig on in then,\u201d he tells you, and you oblige. You exit back into the main living space and sit at the table, quickly stacking your plate with a little bit of everything. Harry joins and the two of you enjoy the breakfast he\u2019s made in comfortable silence. Once you\u2019re both done eating you start tackling the dishes in order to stick to the agreement of whoever cooks doesn\u2019t have to clean whenever the two of you hang out together. He brings the last of the dishes back into the kitchen and places them into the sink, before glancing around and talking again. \u201cS\u2019alright if I hop in the shower? Jeff wants to meet up with us to talk a game plan for everything if that\u2019s ok with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you answer softly and move to turn off the sinks running water. \u201cYou know where it is.\u201d</p><p>He just smiles and nods before going to head out of the room, but his movements suddenly halt, and he quickly turns back around to face you again. No words leave his mouth as he steps towards you and leans down to place the softest kiss on your temple. \u201cThank you again for doing this petal.\u201d</p><p>This time, no words come from you as he turns around and exits the kitchen; mainly because you\u2019re too busy choking on those words as they become stuck in your throat. You stay still for a moment until you hear the bathroom door close from down the hallway and let out the deep breath you didn\u2019t realize you were holding in. \u201cHoly fuck,\u201d you whisper to yourself before finally getting started at cleaning the dishes and thinking to yourself of how this is all going to be quite the show. </p><p>taglist (I freaking love all of you): <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_zkOpOkuuOk8RfJbhzZGYQ\">@trulymadlysydney</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhtayn5WnNlRHHG8U7FG03A\">@foreverhlessed</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp1pFk9bhKh1jZIZ80Z2hiA\">@silklaurentharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFHkU95pgVE5U-iUtvcUt7Q\">@physically-im-fine</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcG7LNLDLGpUUvGyz6N0x2w\">@drowninherperfume</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mySnJBAbOkyxfKQXid3CZFw\">@valenvitrian</a> @letmereid\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq9XkL-P28R-8xe2qX03sAw\">@allthelovexxharry</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIvRIBhQCQZZn9ZFHkqZh-Q\">@sushiabby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkYVZGfl7MA8ME5IxZ7jvRw\">@hiddlestylesbaby</a> @amiablestyles <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTF3VmtFjzS-TSXlP98CO2A\">@karleedaniels27</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt8UgKFohCm9j0NHHigjuQA\">@theregionofthesummerxstars</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKB9oolYg0a3qnq9TGxtr1A\">@delusionalmusichoe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSwfx5lREEHpoyErp7D7R7w\">@mystxrieux</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu56pgniswtzaG8gpePIUfg\">@zoynxedo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpeESTliEgX248s3dSNTpHg\">@blackmilkshake</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlOUT0GA6dntyCdhkgxk1ZA\">@spencer-is-too-perfect</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md6__mRUQVgVE_qj36evVBA\">@justanotherdaydreamersoul</a> </p>",

I can\u2019t get over how many of you were as excited for this as I am, thank you so much you lovely lovely people; hopefully it meets all of your expectations. Also as much as I love the movie version of this particular song, you\u2019re damn right I couldn\u2019t stop listening to the Panic! At the Disco version of it while writing this instead. (My bad)</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"nexttxyou:dGjp3des4aESmOKftHrd3A:ZyVqjj2YzOFFH\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b42b38b7b94de77365af452d43092808/tumblr_pah0zelXBK1udd1p0o1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i><b>\u201cWe light it up, we won\u2019t come down and the sun can\u2019t stop us now.\u201d</b></i></p><p>The sweltering heat beats through the slightly cracked open window of your stuffy LA apartment, causing you to let out an uninterested sigh. You rotate on the tacky but insanely comfy couch you managed to score at a nearby thrift shop; your hair hanging off the edge of it, with your hand pressed to your forehead as you glance at your surroundings just to feed into your boredom. Your gaze falls on the glass of water you willed yourself to get up and grab twenty minutes ago \u2013 observing as the small liquid beads of condensation form and slide their way down the sweaty looking glass, and eventually pool at the bottom of it on the small wooden coffee table. In the background, a rerun of The Office plays on the large television and just as your focus moves to Michael and Dwight driving into a lake; it\u2019s broken when the sound of your apartment door being whipped open snaps you out of your daze.</p><p>You instantly sit up from your position as a feeling of panic rises, but it soon diminishes when you see it\u2019s just your best friend of many years silently shuffling away from the now closed door towards the kitchen. Various noises of cupboard doors opening and closing, followed by a loud groan spark some curious thoughts in your mind as you enter the tiny kitchen to find him leaning forward against the counter. The way his ring-clad fingers grip tightly onto the edge of the dark granite countertop to the point that his knuckles are beginning to show tinges of white, and how his growing curls have fallen in front of his face with him making no move to brush them away has you considering your words before finally speaking up. </p><p>\u201cRough day?\u201d You ask softly and rest your head against the doorframe as you lean against it. The way his shoulders twitch as he lets out the quietest sarcastic chuckle is enough for you know that your question is quite the understatement. He remains silent as his grip on the counter visibly lightens and his intense emerald gaze falls onto you; softening the slightest bit to show the usually radiant green eyes you often find yourself lost in when looking at them. \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me much of a choice, are you?\u201d Harry asks and looks at you with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>You immediately lean away from the doorframe and bite down on your lips as you begin shaking your head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>This causes him to laugh a bit and he joins in on shaking his head as well, knowing well enough that you\u2019d get whatever\u2019s got him acting so strange out of him sooner or later. With a dramatic sigh as he pushes away from the counter and spins around to reach into the fridge that\u2019s directly behind him \u2013 wasting no time in grabbing the newly purchased bottle of wine that resides within it, making a swift move to open up the Pink Moscato Ros\u00e9 beverage and taking a large gulp. Once he\u2019s done, you find yourself trained on his lips as he licks away the small dribbles of wine that escaped the bottle before meeting his mouth; shaking your head once again as his eyes move to you and an arrogant smirk dances across those intriguing lips.</p><p>Part of you wants to make a snarky comment of how his mother raised him better than to not grab glasses for the wine you knew the two of you would be sharing later tonight anyways, but your better judgement knows that he\u2019s had a rough day and it\u2019s best if you didn\u2019t. So instead you let out a breath and hold your hand out towards him; earning yourself another chuckle from the curly haired boy as he passes you the bottle and you take a long swing as well. His eyes don\u2019t leave you as you do this, and the smirk doesn\u2019t fade from his mouth until you set\u00a0the wine onto the counter and he speaks up again. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re going to want more of that after I tell you what happened today.\u201d</p><p>The two of you spend the next hour sat on your couch as Harry repeats the day\u2019s events, and it all truly blows your mind. You never knew what you were getting yourself into when you became friends with someone who was a member of a world renown boy band, but there had always been this deep connection between you and Harry that made you inseparable and is the reason that same friendship has lasted long past his One Direction days and to the present ones. That being said, as someone who likes their privacy and tends to avoid the spotlight as much as they can; you\u2019re never truly prepared for some of the outrageous stories Harry tells that have such a large impact in his life \u2013 including the one he\u2019s just finished explaining. </p><p>\u201cOk so wait,\u201d you slur the slightest bit after finishing off the second bottle of wine you\u2019d just grabbed not that long ago. \u201cYour management team wants you to do <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a PR,\u201d he grumbles and snatches the bottle from your hands; a pout forming on his lips as he flips it upside down and nothing comes out. \u201cThink we could Uber Eats some more of this stuff? Oh, and pizza!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA PR? So, like a public romance type thing?\u201d You ask, and he scowls at you for avoiding his question. \u201cWhy? And with who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell yeh,\u201d he states as he moves to grab his phone from the coffee table and unsurprisingly opens up the Uber Eats app to order more wine and food. \u201cThey think it\u2019ll be beneficial when it comes to promoting the new album. Think it\u2019s quite stupid if m\u2019being honest. Don\u2019t really see what being in a fake relationship has to do with my music and its chances at being successful.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, and you know that Harry. Your fans are going to absolutely love anything you release for them because it\u2019s always amazing. Jeff knows that too but\u2026 who knows. This is why I could never be a celebrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah too bad you don\u2019t get to experience it all with me though, it\u2019d be much more fun if you did,\u201d he replies, and you smile to yourself over how his deep British accent becomes more prominent like it always does when he consumes more than a little bit of alcohol \u2013 however, you\u2019re so focused on those little things that you don\u2019t notice how his eyes have widened and he\u2019s staring at you with a childlike glint of excitement and his million dollar smile. </p><p>You furrow your eyebrows at him and find yourself leaning back onto the couch\u2019s armrest; glancing around behind you to see if someone else had shown up and you were too buzzed to notice because surely, he\u2019s not looking at you like that. Alas, when you realize there indeed is no one else he could possibly be looking at; you find yourself shrinking even further away from him. \u201cW-what? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything or break eye-contact as he scoots closer to you and subtly licks over his drying lips before grinning even wider. \u201cY/N, would you like to be my PR?\u201d </p><p>You can\u2019t help the snort that leaves your mouth as he asks this, and luckily the sound of someone wanting to be buzzed into your apartment building allows you to avoid the question. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d you tell him and move from your cross-legged position to stand up and grab the empty wine bottles and open bag of chips from the table; before making way to press the button on the wall that unlocks the buildings front door and place the items in the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean it as a joke,\u201d Harry\u2019s voice sounds from behind you, and you roll your eyes. \u201cKind of being serious actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I love you but there\u2019s literally no chance in hell that I\u2019d want to do that,\u201d you tell him firmly and turn around to face him standing in the doorway. </p><p>He ponders your response for a moment before shaking his head and laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d You ask incredulously, becoming defensive at his choice of words. \u201cWhat in the world makes you think I want anything to do with any of that? As my best friend I figured you\u2019d know by now how much the spotlight really does not appeal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know it doesn\u2019t, but I also know how there\u2019s a part of you deep down that\u2019s curious to see what would happen,\u201d he argues and steps into the room. He takes all of two strides to reach you, and you quickly turn to the side; your back being pressed against the counter as he very much barges into your personal space. There isn\u2019t much room to move around in the kitchen to begin with, but as Harry takes up the majority of free space between you and the other counter that is a mere two meters away; it feels so much smaller. He looks down at you intensely and you feel that he\u2019s towering over you much more than usual \u2013 finding yourself nervous with how close he is, but also not wanting him to move away. Neither of you say anything because you know what he said is true. The entire concept is pretty intriguing actually, but you refuse to allow him to have the glory in being right and getting what he wants.</p><p>Your stare down with each other continues for another moment until he starts inching closer, but you continue your silent protest \u2013 even when he leans towards you; placing his hands onto the counter on either of your waist and only stops when he\u2019s inches away from your face. If it was anyone other than Harry, you\u2019d be intimidated by such a gesture but for him it\u2019s the exact opposite. Not only are you beginning to view this is a competition that\u2019s forming between the two of you; seeing who will crumble before the other into a dusty pile of embarrassment, but you and your ruthless ass actually like the feeling \u2013 and you completely ignore the way your heart is fluttering in your chest just like the swarm of butterflies that are making their presence known in your stomach as well. </p><p>Neither of you crack nor move away until a knock sounds from the door, and even then, you still ignore it. Harry doesn\u2019t flinch in the slightest and you\u2019re determined to do the same but have to give up when there\u2019s another loud knock. Without saying a word, you slide to the left and away from him. He instantly moves his hand, so you can escape from being in such close proximity of each other, and watches as you walk towards the front door and glance over your shoulder at him with a smirk. \u201cStill not going to happen H.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come <i>on</i>,\u201d he groans and follows after you. The smug look you have on your face doesn\u2019t deteriorate as you unlock the front door and open it up to greet the Uber Eats worker standing on the other side, and Harry is behind you in an instant to continue his complaining. \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to consider it? Just going to shut the whole idea down because, because you\u2019re a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a coward,\u201d you snap, and whip your head to the side so you can glare at him over your shoulder again. \u201cNow would you shut up for just a second?\u201d</p><p>You turn around to look at the college aged boy who stares into your apartment with an awestruck expression and let out a sigh. \u201cY-You\u2019re Harry Styles,\u201d he stammers, and you move to glance between him and your best friend. Harry doesn\u2019t reply as he sends the boy a closed-mouthed smile before dragging his hand through his curls like he always does when he\u2019s stressed or aggravated in some way. You look back to the boy and quickly grab the bag of food he\u2019s holding, before he can drop it due to the lack of concentration he has on the reason he\u2019s standing at your door in the first place. </p><p>You scowl at him and your eyes widen as you notice him slowly reaching towards his pocket, where his cell phone very clearly resides and inhale a sharp breath. \u201cUh, um, thank you!\u201d You spurt out and quickly shut the door, before making sure it\u2019s locked and leaning your back against it. </p><p>Harry gives you a thankful nod, and soon goes back into arguing. \u201cWill you please consider it at least?\u201d</p><p>Your shoulders slump at his words, and you don\u2019t say anything as you push off the door to walk past him towards the couch to sit back down. \u201cWhy me of all people H? Surely there\u2019s literally anyone else who could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah but I really don\u2019t want to pretend to be in a relationship with someone I know nothing about,\u201d he explains and plops down onto his spot beside you again; wasting no time in cracking open the new bottle of wine and finding a movie to watch on Netflix. \u201cI\u2019d actually feel comfortable doing something so awkward because it wouldn\u2019t be with just anyone, it\u2019d be with my best friend. Maybe it\u2019d even be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Harry,\u201d you respond and bite down onto your lip. \u201cIt also sounds like something that could end really badly. Not to sound negative or anything but that world is such a big part of your life and I don\u2019t belong in it. Sure, people know who I am because everyone knows we\u2019re friends, but I\u2019ve always been there in the shadows. Away from the people, and away from the attention\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t know how to handle it if things were to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be there with you every step of the way Y/N,\u201d he states softly, and you let out a knowing sigh. \u201cListen, obviously I can\u2019t make you do it, but would you at least consider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I can do that,\u201d you tell him, and his dimples aren\u2019t long in being on full display. He drops the topic after that and the two of you spend the remainder of the evening watching movies and eating the cold leftover pizza, before eventually cutting yourselves off the wine once you\u2019ve finished half of the third bottle in less than twenty minutes. </p><p>Harry is the first to fall asleep with his head leant against the armrest on his end of the couch, but you lay awake thinking about what he\u2019s asked you to do and consider possible outcomes. Soon enough, you allow yourself to accept the fact that maybe it won\u2019t be as bad as you\u2019re thinking it will be, and eventually fall asleep curled up by your best friend on the opposite end of the comfortable piece of furniture. </p><p>You wake up the next morning alone in the living room and are instantly confused. Without a moment to waste, you sit up straight on the couch and take in Harry\u2019s notable absence. The throw blanket that usually stays draped over the back of chair in the corner of the room lays across your lap, and you know it was Harry that put it there. Before you become too worried as to where he could\u2019ve gone; his distinctive voice rings from behind you.</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re awake,\u201d he greets with a large dimpled grin as you turn around to see him peaking his head out from the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m making waffles.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cDid you just quote Donkey from Shrek?\u201d You groan as you stretch your arms high above your head to crack your stiff back, before reaching down to rub at your tired eyes. </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he replies. \u201cBut I actually did so come get some.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help the smile that takes over your mouth as you stand up and slowly shuffle towards the kitchen to get some of the waffles that smell really good. The small dinner table that is set against the outer wall of the kitchen is filled with various plates of fruit, toast, bacon, and eggs so naturally you have to steal one of the appetizing looking clementine\u2019s he\u2019s set out; playing catch with it a couple times until you reach the doorway. \u201cReally trying to butter me up about this whole thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He freezes in his position of holding the carton of orange juice he was preparing to pour into the two glasses he has set beside a plate stacked with toaster waffles, and slowly moves his gaze to you. \u201cI- ok yeah. I thought-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do this Harry,\u201d you cut him off and try to ignore the butterflies that are fluttering in your stomach again. </p><p>\u201cI know but I wanted to do something nice because I really am asking a lot from you to do this whole thing, and m\u2019not going to be mad if you say no or anything seeing as you\u2019d literally have to pretend to be in a relationship with me but-,\u201d he mindlessly rambles but stops when you step forward and cut him off for a second time. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He looks at you in pure shock before he sets down the juice, and his expression melts into the all too familiar grin that you love so much. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you tell him while nodding your head and smiling widely. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be\u2026 fun. And what kind of friend would I be if I let you pretend to be in a relationship with someone you can\u2019t stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst kind,\u201d he replies jokingly before taking a couple strides and engulfing you into a tight hug. \u201cThank you, Y/N. Really. You don\u2019t know how much that means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I can help,\u201d you respond and lean into his chest. The two of you stay like that for a moment before realizing just exactly what is going on, and both slowly move away. You can\u00a0feel the elephant that\u2019s beginning to form in the room and are quick in changing the subject to avoid any further awkwardness. \u201cOk now I\u2019m ready for all this food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDig on in then,\u201d he tells you, and you oblige. You exit back into the main living space and sit at the table, quickly stacking your plate with a little bit of everything. Harry joins and the two of you enjoy the breakfast he\u2019s made in comfortable silence. Once you\u2019re both done eating you start tackling the dishes in order to stick to the agreement of whoever cooks doesn\u2019t have to clean whenever the two of you hang out together. He brings the last of the dishes back into the kitchen and places them into the sink, before glancing around and talking again. \u201cS\u2019alright if I hop in the shower? Jeff wants to meet up with us to talk a game plan for everything if that\u2019s ok with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you answer softly and move to turn off the sinks running water. \u201cYou know where it is.\u201d</p><p>He just smiles and nods before going to head out of the room, but his movements suddenly halt, and he quickly turns back around to face you again. No words leave his mouth as he steps towards you and leans down to place the softest kiss on your temple. \u201cThank you again for doing this petal.\u201d</p><p>This time, no words come from you as he turns around and exits the kitchen; mainly because you\u2019re too busy choking on those words as they become stuck in your throat. You stay still for a moment until you hear the bathroom door close from down the hallway and let out the deep breath you didn\u2019t realize you were holding in. \u201cHoly fuck,\u201d you whisper to yourself before finally getting started at cleaning the dishes and thinking to yourself of how this is all going to be quite the show. </p><p>taglist (I freaking love all of you): <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_zkOpOkuuOk8RfJbhzZGYQ\">@trulymadlysydney</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhtayn5WnNlRHHG8U7FG03A\">@foreverhlessed</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp1pFk9bhKh1jZIZ80Z2hiA\">@silklaurentharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFHkU95pgVE5U-iUtvcUt7Q\">@physically-im-fine</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcG7LNLDLGpUUvGyz6N0x2w\">@drowninherperfume</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mySnJBAbOkyxfKQXid3CZFw\">@valenvitrian</a> @letmereid\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq9XkL-P28R-8xe2qX03sAw\">@allthelovexxharry</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIvRIBhQCQZZn9ZFHkqZh-Q\">@sushiabby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkYVZGfl7MA8ME5IxZ7jvRw\">@hiddlestylesbaby</a> @amiablestyles <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTF3VmtFjzS-TSXlP98CO2A\">@karleedaniels27</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt8UgKFohCm9j0NHHigjuQA\">@theregionofthesummerxstars</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKB9oolYg0a3qnq9TGxtr1A\">@delusionalmusichoe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSwfx5lREEHpoyErp7D7R7w\">@mystxrieux</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu56pgniswtzaG8gpePIUfg\">@zoynxedo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpeESTliEgX248s3dSNTpHg\">@blackmilkshake</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlOUT0GA6dntyCdhkgxk1ZA\">@spencer-is-too-perfect</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md6__mRUQVgVE_qj36evVBA\">@justanotherdaydreamersoul</a> </p></p>",

I can\u2019t get over how many of you were as excited for this as I am, thank you so much you lovely lovely people; hopefully it meets all of your expectations. Also as much as I love the movie version of this particular song, you\u2019re damn right I couldn\u2019t stop listening to the Panic! At the Disco version of it while writing this instead.

You rotate on the tacky but insanely comfy couch you managed to score at a nearby thrift shop; your hair hanging off the edge of it, with your hand pressed to your forehead as you glance at your surroundings just to feed into your boredom. Your gaze falls on the glass of water you willed yourself to get up and grab twenty minutes ago \u2013 observing as the small liquid beads of condensation form and slide their way down the sweaty looking glass, and eventually pool at the bottom of it on the small wooden coffee table. In the background, a rerun of The Office plays on the large television and just as your focus moves to Michael and Dwight driving into a lake; it\u2019s broken when the sound of your apartment door being whipped open snaps you out of your daze.</p><p>You instantly sit up from your position as a feeling of panic rises, but it soon diminishes when you see it\u2019s just your best friend of many years silently shuffling away from the now closed door towards the kitchen. Various noises of cupboard doors opening and closing, followed by a loud groan spark some curious thoughts in your mind as you enter the tiny kitchen to find him leaning forward against the counter. The way his ring-clad fingers grip tightly onto the edge of the dark granite countertop to the point that his knuckles are beginning to show tinges of white, and how his growing curls have fallen in front of his face with him making no move to brush them away has you considering your words before finally speaking up. </p><p>\u201cRough day?\u201d You ask softly and rest your head against the doorframe as you lean against it. The way his shoulders twitch as he lets out the quietest sarcastic chuckle is enough for you know that your question is quite the understatement. He remains silent as his grip on the counter visibly lightens and his intense emerald gaze falls onto you; softening the slightest bit to show the usually radiant green eyes you often find yourself lost in when looking at them. \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me much of a choice, are you?\u201d Harry asks and looks at you with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>You immediately lean away from the doorframe and bite down on your lips as you begin shaking your head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>This causes him to laugh a bit and he joins in on shaking his head as well, knowing well enough that you\u2019d get whatever\u2019s got him acting so strange out of him sooner or later. With a dramatic sigh as he pushes away from the counter and spins around to reach into the fridge that\u2019s directly behind him \u2013 wasting no time in grabbing the newly purchased bottle of wine that resides within it, making a swift move to open up the Pink Moscato Ros\u00e9 beverage and taking a large gulp. Once he\u2019s done, you find yourself trained on his lips as he licks away the small dribbles of wine that escaped the bottle before meeting his mouth; shaking your head once again as his eyes move to you and an arrogant smirk dances across those intriguing lips.</p><p>Part of you wants to make a snarky comment of how his mother raised him better than to not grab glasses for the wine you knew the two of you would be sharing later tonight anyways, but your better judgement knows that he\u2019s had a rough day and it\u2019s best if you didn\u2019t. So instead you let out a breath and hold your hand out towards him; earning yourself another chuckle from the curly haired boy as he passes you the bottle and you take a long swing as well. His eyes don\u2019t leave you as you do this, and the smirk doesn\u2019t fade from his mouth until you set\u00a0the wine onto the counter and he speaks up again. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re going to want more of that after I tell you what happened today.\u201d</p><p>The two of you spend the next hour sat on your couch as Harry repeats the day\u2019s events, and it all truly blows your mind. You never knew what you were getting yourself into when you became friends with someone who was a member of a world renown boy band, but there had always been this deep connection between you and Harry that made you inseparable and is the reason that same friendship has lasted long past his One Direction days and to the present ones. That being said, as someone who likes their privacy and tends to avoid the spotlight as much as they can; you\u2019re never truly prepared for some of the outrageous stories Harry tells that have such a large impact in his life \u2013 including the one he\u2019s just finished explaining. </p><p>\u201cOk so wait,\u201d you slur the slightest bit after finishing off the second bottle of wine you\u2019d just grabbed not that long ago. \u201cYour management team wants you to do <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a PR,\u201d he grumbles and snatches the bottle from your hands; a pout forming on his lips as he flips it upside down and nothing comes out. \u201cThink we could Uber Eats some more of this stuff? Oh, and pizza!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA PR? So, like a public romance type thing?\u201d You ask, and he scowls at you for avoiding his question. \u201cWhy? And with who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell yeh,\u201d he states as he moves to grab his phone from the coffee table and unsurprisingly opens up the Uber Eats app to order more wine and food. \u201cThey think it\u2019ll be beneficial when it comes to promoting the new album. Think it\u2019s quite stupid if m\u2019being honest. Don\u2019t really see what being in a fake relationship has to do with my music and its chances at being successful.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, and you know that Harry. Your fans are going to absolutely love anything you release for them because it\u2019s always amazing. Jeff knows that too but\u2026 who knows. This is why I could never be a celebrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah too bad you don\u2019t get to experience it all with me though, it\u2019d be much more fun if you did,\u201d he replies, and you smile to yourself over how his deep British accent becomes more prominent like it always does when he consumes more than a little bit of alcohol \u2013 however, you\u2019re so focused on those little things that you don\u2019t notice how his eyes have widened and he\u2019s staring at you with a childlike glint of excitement and his million dollar smile. </p><p>You furrow your eyebrows at him and find yourself leaning back onto the couch\u2019s armrest; glancing around behind you to see if someone else had shown up and you were too buzzed to notice because surely, he\u2019s not looking at you like that. Alas, when you realize there indeed is no one else he could possibly be looking at; you find yourself shrinking even further away from him. \u201cW-what? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything or break eye-contact as he scoots closer to you and subtly licks over his drying lips before grinning even wider. \u201cY/N, would you like to be my PR?\u201d </p><p>You can\u2019t help the snort that leaves your mouth as he asks this, and luckily the sound of someone wanting to be buzzed into your apartment building allows you to avoid the question. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d you tell him and move from your cross-legged position to stand up and grab the empty wine bottles and open bag of chips from the table; before making way to press the button on the wall that unlocks the buildings front door and place the items in the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean it as a joke,\u201d Harry\u2019s voice sounds from behind you, and you roll your eyes. \u201cKind of being serious actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I love you but there\u2019s literally no chance in hell that I\u2019d want to do that,\u201d you tell him firmly and turn around to face him standing in the doorway. </p><p>He ponders your response for a moment before shaking his head and laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d You ask incredulously, becoming defensive at his choice of words. \u201cWhat in the world makes you think I want anything to do with any of that? As my best friend I figured you\u2019d know by now how much the spotlight really does not appeal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know it doesn\u2019t, but I also know how there\u2019s a part of you deep down that\u2019s curious to see what would happen,\u201d he argues and steps into the room. He takes all of two strides to reach you, and you quickly turn to the side; your back being pressed against the counter as he very much barges into your personal space. There isn\u2019t much room to move around in the kitchen to begin with, but as Harry takes up the majority of free space between you and the other counter that is a mere two meters away; it feels so much smaller. He looks down at you intensely and you feel that he\u2019s towering over you much more than usual \u2013 finding yourself nervous with how close he is, but also not wanting him to move away. Neither of you say anything because you know what he said is true. The entire concept is pretty intriguing actually, but you refuse to allow him to have the glory in being right and getting what he wants.</p><p>Your stare down with each other continues for another moment until he starts inching closer, but you continue your silent protest \u2013 even when he leans towards you; placing his hands onto the counter on either of your waist and only stops when he\u2019s inches away from your face. If it was anyone other than Harry, you\u2019d be intimidated by such a gesture but for him it\u2019s the exact opposite. Not only are you beginning to view this is a competition that\u2019s forming between the two of you; seeing who will crumble before the other into a dusty pile of embarrassment, but you and your ruthless ass actually like the feeling \u2013 and you completely ignore the way your heart is fluttering in your chest just like the swarm of butterflies that are making their presence known in your stomach as well. </p><p>Neither of you crack nor move away until a knock sounds from the door, and even then, you still ignore it. Harry doesn\u2019t flinch in the slightest and you\u2019re determined to do the same but have to give up when there\u2019s another loud knock. Without saying a word, you slide to the left and away from him. He instantly moves his hand, so you can escape from being in such close proximity of each other, and watches as you walk towards the front door and glance over your shoulder at him with a smirk. \u201cStill not going to happen H.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come <i>on</i>,\u201d he groans and follows after you. The smug look you have on your face doesn\u2019t deteriorate as you unlock the front door and open it up to greet the Uber Eats worker standing on the other side, and Harry is behind you in an instant to continue his complaining. \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to consider it? Just going to shut the whole idea down because, because you\u2019re a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a coward,\u201d you snap, and whip your head to the side so you can glare at him over your shoulder again. \u201cNow would you shut up for just a second?\u201d</p><p>You turn around to look at the college aged boy who stares into your apartment with an awestruck expression and let out a sigh. \u201cY-You\u2019re Harry Styles,\u201d he stammers, and you move to glance between him and your best friend. Harry doesn\u2019t reply as he sends the boy a closed-mouthed smile before dragging his hand through his curls like he always does when he\u2019s stressed or aggravated in some way. You look back to the boy and quickly grab the bag of food he\u2019s holding, before he can drop it due to the lack of concentration he has on the reason he\u2019s standing at your door in the first place. </p><p>You scowl at him and your eyes widen as you notice him slowly reaching towards his pocket, where his cell phone very clearly resides and inhale a sharp breath. \u201cUh, um, thank you!\u201d You spurt out and quickly shut the door, before making sure it\u2019s locked and leaning your back against it. </p><p>Harry gives you a thankful nod, and soon goes back into arguing. \u201cWill you please consider it at least?\u201d</p><p>Your shoulders slump at his words, and you don\u2019t say anything as you push off the door to walk past him towards the couch to sit back down. \u201cWhy me of all people H? Surely there\u2019s literally anyone else who could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah but I really don\u2019t want to pretend to be in a relationship with someone I know nothing about,\u201d he explains and plops down onto his spot beside you again; wasting no time in cracking open the new bottle of wine and finding a movie to watch on Netflix. \u201cI\u2019d actually feel comfortable doing something so awkward because it wouldn\u2019t be with just anyone, it\u2019d be with my best friend. Maybe it\u2019d even be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Harry,\u201d you respond and bite down onto your lip. \u201cIt also sounds like something that could end really badly. Not to sound negative or anything but that world is such a big part of your life and I don\u2019t belong in it. Sure, people know who I am because everyone knows we\u2019re friends, but I\u2019ve always been there in the shadows. Away from the people, and away from the attention\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t know how to handle it if things were to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be there with you every step of the way Y/N,\u201d he states softly, and you let out a knowing sigh. \u201cListen, obviously I can\u2019t make you do it, but would you at least consider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I can do that,\u201d you tell him, and his dimples aren\u2019t long in being on full display. He drops the topic after that and the two of you spend the remainder of the evening watching movies and eating the cold leftover pizza, before eventually cutting yourselves off the wine once you\u2019ve finished half of the third bottle in less than twenty minutes. </p><p>Harry is the first to fall asleep with his head leant against the armrest on his end of the couch, but you lay awake thinking about what he\u2019s asked you to do and consider possible outcomes. Soon enough, you allow yourself to accept the fact that maybe it won\u2019t be as bad as you\u2019re thinking it will be, and eventually fall asleep curled up by your best friend on the opposite end of the comfortable piece of furniture. </p><p>You wake up the next morning alone in the living room and are instantly confused. Without a moment to waste, you sit up straight on the couch and take in Harry\u2019s notable absence. The throw blanket that usually stays draped over the back of chair in the corner of the room lays across your lap, and you know it was Harry that put it there. Before you become too worried as to where he could\u2019ve gone; his distinctive voice rings from behind you.</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re awake,\u201d he greets with a large dimpled grin as you turn around to see him peaking his head out from the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m making waffles.\u2019\u2019</p><p>\u201cDid you just quote Donkey from Shrek?\u201d You groan as you stretch your arms high above your head to crack your stiff back, before reaching down to rub at your tired eyes. </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he replies. \u201cBut I actually did so come get some.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help the smile that takes over your mouth as you stand up and slowly shuffle towards the kitchen to get some of the waffles that smell really good. The small dinner table that is set against the outer wall of the kitchen is filled with various plates of fruit, toast, bacon, and eggs so naturally you have to steal one of the appetizing looking clementine\u2019s he\u2019s set out; playing catch with it a couple times until you reach the doorway. \u201cReally trying to butter me up about this whole thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He freezes in his position of holding the carton of orange juice he was preparing to pour into the two glasses he has set beside a plate stacked with toaster waffles, and slowly moves his gaze to you. \u201cI- ok yeah. I thought-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do this Harry,\u201d you cut him off and try to ignore the butterflies that are fluttering in your stomach again. </p><p>\u201cI know but I wanted to do something nice because I really am asking a lot from you to do this whole thing, and m\u2019not going to be mad if you say no or anything seeing as you\u2019d literally have to pretend to be in a relationship with me but-,\u201d he mindlessly rambles but stops when you step forward and cut him off for a second time. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He looks at you in pure shock before he sets down the juice, and his expression melts into the all too familiar grin that you love so much. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you tell him while nodding your head and smiling widely. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be\u2026 fun. And what kind of friend would I be if I let you pretend to be in a relationship with someone you can\u2019t stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst kind,\u201d he replies jokingly before taking a couple strides and engulfing you into a tight hug. \u201cThank you, Y/N. Really. You don\u2019t know how much that means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I can help,\u201d you respond and lean into his chest. The two of you stay like that for a moment before realizing just exactly what is going on, and both slowly move away. You can\u00a0feel the elephant that\u2019s beginning to form in the room and are quick in changing the subject to avoid any further awkwardness. \u201cOk now I\u2019m ready for all this food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDig on in then,\u201d he tells you, and you oblige. You exit back into the main living space and sit at the table, quickly stacking your plate with a little bit of everything. Harry joins and the two of you enjoy the breakfast he\u2019s made in comfortable silence. Once you\u2019re both done eating you start tackling the dishes in order to stick to the agreement of whoever cooks doesn\u2019t have to clean whenever the two of you hang out together. He brings the last of the dishes back into the kitchen and places them into the sink, before glancing around and talking again. \u201cS\u2019alright if I hop in the shower? Jeff wants to meet up with us to talk a game plan for everything if that\u2019s ok with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you answer softly and move to turn off the sinks running water. \u201cYou know where it is.\u201d</p><p>He just smiles and nods before going to head out of the room, but his movements suddenly halt, and he quickly turns back around to face you again. No words leave his mouth as he steps towards you and leans down to place the softest kiss on your temple. \u201cThank you again for doing this petal.\u201d</p><p>This time, no words come from you as he turns around and exits the kitchen; mainly because you\u2019re too busy choking on those words as they become stuck in your throat. You stay still for a moment until you hear the bathroom door close from down the hallway and let out the deep breath you didn\u2019t realize you were holding in. \u201cHoly fuck,\u201d you whisper to yourself before finally getting started at cleaning the dishes and thinking to yourself of how this is all going to be quite the show. </p><p>taglist (I freaking love all of you): <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_zkOpOkuuOk8RfJbhzZGYQ\">@trulymadlysydney</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhtayn5WnNlRHHG8U7FG03A\">@foreverhlessed</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp1pFk9bhKh1jZIZ80Z2hiA\">@silklaurentharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFHkU95pgVE5U-iUtvcUt7Q\">@physically-im-fine</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcG7LNLDLGpUUvGyz6N0x2w\">@drowninherperfume</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mySnJBAbOkyxfKQXid3CZFw\">@valenvitrian</a> @letmereid\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq9XkL-P28R-8xe2qX03sAw\">@allthelovexxharry</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIvRIBhQCQZZn9ZFHkqZh-Q\">@sushiabby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkYVZGfl7MA8ME5IxZ7jvRw\">@hiddlestylesbaby</a> @amiablestyles <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTF3VmtFjzS-TSXlP98CO2A\">@karleedaniels27</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt8UgKFohCm9j0NHHigjuQA\">@theregionofthesummerxstars</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKB9oolYg0a3qnq9TGxtr1A\">@delusionalmusichoe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSwfx5lREEHpoyErp7D7R7w\">@mystxrieux</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu56pgniswtzaG8gpePIUfg\">@zoynxedo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpeESTliEgX248s3dSNTpHg\">@blackmilkshake</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlOUT0GA6dntyCdhkgxk1ZA\">@spencer-is-too-perfect</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md6__mRUQVgVE_qj36evVBA\">@justanotherdaydreamersoul</a> </p></p>",

I can&rsquo;t get over how many of you were as excited for this as I am, thank you so much you lovely lovely people; hopefully it meets all of your expectations. Also as much as I love the movie version of this particular song, you&rsquo;re damn right I couldn&rsquo;t stop listening to the Panic! At the Disco version of it while writing this instead. (My bad)</i></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i><b>&ldquo;We light it up, we won&rsquo;t come down and the sun can&rsquo;t stop us now.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>The sweltering heat beats through the slightly cracked open window of your stuffy LA apartment, causing you to let out an uninterested sigh. You rotate on the tacky but insanely comfy couch you managed to score at a nearby thrift shop; your hair hanging off the edge of it, with your hand pressed to your forehead as you glance at your surroundings just to feed into your boredom. Your gaze falls on the glass of water you willed yourself to get up and grab twenty minutes ago &ndash; observing as the small liquid beads of condensation form and slide their way down the sweaty looking glass, and eventually pool at the bottom of it on the small wooden coffee table. In the background, a rerun of The Office plays on the large television and just as your focus moves to Michael and Dwight driving into a lake; it&rsquo;s broken when the sound of your apartment door being whipped open snaps you out of your daze.</p><p>You instantly sit up from your position as a feeling of panic rises, but it soon diminishes when you see it&rsquo;s just your best friend of many years silently shuffling away from the now closed door towards the kitchen. Various noises of cupboard doors opening and closing, followed by a loud groan spark some curious thoughts in your mind as you enter the tiny kitchen to find him leaning forward against the counter. The way his ring-clad fingers grip tightly onto the edge of the dark granite countertop to the point that his knuckles are beginning to show tinges of white, and how his growing curls have fallen in front of his face with him making no move to brush them away has you considering your words before finally speaking up. </p><p>&ldquo;Rough day?&rdquo; You ask softly and rest your head against the doorframe as you lean against it. The way his shoulders twitch as he lets out the quietest sarcastic chuckle is enough for you know that your question is quite the understatement. He remains silent as his grip on the counter visibly lightens and his intense emerald gaze falls onto you; softening the slightest bit to show the usually radiant green eyes you often find yourself lost in when looking at them. &ldquo;Wanna talk about it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to give me much of a choice, are you?&rdquo; Harry asks and looks at you with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>You immediately lean away from the doorframe and bite down on your lips as you begin shaking your head. &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p><p>This causes him to laugh a bit and he joins in on shaking his head as well, knowing well enough that you&rsquo;d get whatever&rsquo;s got him acting so strange out of him sooner or later. With a dramatic sigh as he pushes away from the counter and spins around to reach into the fridge that&rsquo;s directly behind him &ndash; wasting no time in grabbing the newly purchased bottle of wine that resides within it, making a swift move to open up the Pink Moscato Ros&eacute; beverage and taking a large gulp. Once he&rsquo;s done, you find yourself trained on his lips as he licks away the small dribbles of wine that escaped the bottle before meeting his mouth; shaking your head once again as his eyes move to you and an arrogant smirk dances across those intriguing lips.</p><p>Part of you wants to make a snarky comment of how his mother raised him better than to not grab glasses for the wine you knew the two of you would be sharing later tonight anyways, but your better judgement knows that he&rsquo;s had a rough day and it&rsquo;s best if you didn&rsquo;t. So instead you let out a breath and hold your hand out towards him; earning yourself another chuckle from the curly haired boy as he passes you the bottle and you take a long swing as well. His eyes don&rsquo;t leave you as you do this, and the smirk doesn&rsquo;t fade from his mouth until you set&nbsp;the wine onto the counter and he speaks up again. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re going to want more of that after I tell you what happened today.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of you spend the next hour sat on your couch as Harry repeats the day&rsquo;s events, and it all truly blows your mind. You never knew what you were getting yourself into when you became friends with someone who was a member of a world renown boy band, but there had always been this deep connection between you and Harry that made you inseparable and is the reason that same friendship has lasted long past his One Direction days and to the present ones. That being said, as someone who likes their privacy and tends to avoid the spotlight as much as they can; you&rsquo;re never truly prepared for some of the outrageous stories Harry tells that have such a large impact in his life &ndash; including the one he&rsquo;s just finished explaining. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok so wait,&rdquo; you slur the slightest bit after finishing off the second bottle of wine you&rsquo;d just grabbed not that long ago. &ldquo;Your management team wants you to do <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a PR,&rdquo; he grumbles and snatches the bottle from your hands; a pout forming on his lips as he flips it upside down and nothing comes out. &ldquo;Think we could Uber Eats some more of this stuff? Oh, and pizza!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A PR? So, like a public romance type thing?&rdquo; You ask, and he scowls at you for avoiding his question. &ldquo;Why? And with who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t tell yeh,&rdquo; he states as he moves to grab his phone from the coffee table and unsurprisingly opens up the Uber Eats app to order more wine and food. &ldquo;They think it&rsquo;ll be beneficial when it comes to promoting the new album. Think it&rsquo;s quite stupid if m&rsquo;being honest. Don&rsquo;t really see what being in a fake relationship has to do with my music and its chances at being successful.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t, and you know that Harry. Your fans are going to absolutely love anything you release for them because it&rsquo;s always amazing. Jeff knows that too but&hellip; who knows. This is why I could never be a celebrity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah too bad you don&rsquo;t get to experience it all with me though, it&rsquo;d be much more fun if you did,&rdquo; he replies, and you smile to yourself over how his deep British accent becomes more prominent like it always does when he consumes more than a little bit of alcohol &ndash; however, you&rsquo;re so focused on those little things that you don&rsquo;t notice how his eyes have widened and he&rsquo;s staring at you with a childlike glint of excitement and his million dollar smile. </p><p>You furrow your eyebrows at him and find yourself leaning back onto the couch&rsquo;s armrest; glancing around behind you to see if someone else had shown up and you were too buzzed to notice because surely, he&rsquo;s not looking at you like that. Alas, when you realize there indeed is no one else he could possibly be looking at; you find yourself shrinking even further away from him. &ldquo;W-what? Why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t say anything or break eye-contact as he scoots closer to you and subtly licks over his drying lips before grinning even wider. &ldquo;Y/N, would you like to be my PR?&rdquo; </p><p>You can&rsquo;t help the snort that leaves your mouth as he asks this, and luckily the sound of someone wanting to be buzzed into your apartment building allows you to avoid the question. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; you tell him and move from your cross-legged position to stand up and grab the empty wine bottles and open bag of chips from the table; before making way to press the button on the wall that unlocks the buildings front door and place the items in the kitchen. </p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t mean it as a joke,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice sounds from behind you, and you roll your eyes. &ldquo;Kind of being serious actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I love you but there&rsquo;s literally no chance in hell that I&rsquo;d want to do that,&rdquo; you tell him firmly and turn around to face him standing in the doorway. </p><p>He ponders your response for a moment before shaking his head and laughing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; You ask incredulously, becoming defensive at his choice of words. &ldquo;What in the world makes you think I want anything to do with any of that? As my best friend I figured you&rsquo;d know by now how much the spotlight really does not appeal to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it doesn&rsquo;t, but I also know how there&rsquo;s a part of you deep down that&rsquo;s curious to see what would happen,&rdquo; he argues and steps into the room. He takes all of two strides to reach you, and you quickly turn to the side; your back being pressed against the counter as he very much barges into your personal space. There isn&rsquo;t much room to move around in the kitchen to begin with, but as Harry takes up the majority of free space between you and the other counter that is a mere two meters away; it feels so much smaller. He looks down at you intensely and you feel that he&rsquo;s towering over you much more than usual &ndash; finding yourself nervous with how close he is, but also not wanting him to move away. Neither of you say anything because you know what he said is true. The entire concept is pretty intriguing actually, but you refuse to allow him to have the glory in being right and getting what he wants.</p><p>Your stare down with each other continues for another moment until he starts inching closer, but you continue your silent protest &ndash; even when he leans towards you; placing his hands onto the counter on either of your waist and only stops when he&rsquo;s inches away from your face. If it was anyone other than Harry, you&rsquo;d be intimidated by such a gesture but for him it&rsquo;s the exact opposite. Not only are you beginning to view this is a competition that&rsquo;s forming between the two of you; seeing who will crumble before the other into a dusty pile of embarrassment, but you and your ruthless ass actually like the feeling &ndash; and you completely ignore the way your heart is fluttering in your chest just like the swarm of butterflies that are making their presence known in your stomach as well. </p><p>Neither of you crack nor move away until a knock sounds from the door, and even then, you still ignore it. Harry doesn&rsquo;t flinch in the slightest and you&rsquo;re determined to do the same but have to give up when there&rsquo;s another loud knock. Without saying a word, you slide to the left and away from him. He instantly moves his hand, so you can escape from being in such close proximity of each other, and watches as you walk towards the front door and glance over your shoulder at him with a smirk. &ldquo;Still not going to happen H.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come <i>on</i>,&rdquo; he groans and follows after you. The smug look you have on your face doesn&rsquo;t deteriorate as you unlock the front door and open it up to greet the Uber Eats worker standing on the other side, and Harry is behind you in an instant to continue his complaining. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not even going to consider it? Just going to shut the whole idea down because, because you&rsquo;re a coward.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not a coward,&rdquo; you snap, and whip your head to the side so you can glare at him over your shoulder again. &ldquo;Now would you shut up for just a second?&rdquo;</p><p>You turn around to look at the college aged boy who stares into your apartment with an awestruck expression and let out a sigh. &ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;re Harry Styles,&rdquo; he stammers, and you move to glance between him and your best friend. Harry doesn&rsquo;t reply as he sends the boy a closed-mouthed smile before dragging his hand through his curls like he always does when he&rsquo;s stressed or aggravated in some way. You look back to the boy and quickly grab the bag of food he&rsquo;s holding, before he can drop it due to the lack of concentration he has on the reason he&rsquo;s standing at your door in the first place. </p><p>You scowl at him and your eyes widen as you notice him slowly reaching towards his pocket, where his cell phone very clearly resides and inhale a sharp breath. &ldquo;Uh, um, thank you!&rdquo; You spurt out and quickly shut the door, before making sure it&rsquo;s locked and leaning your back against it. </p><p>Harry gives you a thankful nod, and soon goes back into arguing. &ldquo;Will you please consider it at least?&rdquo;</p><p>Your shoulders slump at his words, and you don&rsquo;t say anything as you push off the door to walk past him towards the couch to sit back down. &ldquo;Why me of all people H? Surely there&rsquo;s literally anyone else who could do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well yeah but I really don&rsquo;t want to pretend to be in a relationship with someone I know nothing about,&rdquo; he explains and plops down onto his spot beside you again; wasting no time in cracking open the new bottle of wine and finding a movie to watch on Netflix. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d actually feel comfortable doing something so awkward because it wouldn&rsquo;t be with just anyone, it&rsquo;d be with my best friend. Maybe it&rsquo;d even be fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Harry,&rdquo; you respond and bite down onto your lip. &ldquo;It also sounds like something that could end really badly. Not to sound negative or anything but that world is such a big part of your life and I don&rsquo;t belong in it. Sure, people know who I am because everyone knows we&rsquo;re friends, but I&rsquo;ve always been there in the shadows. Away from the people, and away from the attention&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to handle it if things were to change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be there with you every step of the way Y/N,&rdquo; he states softly, and you let out a knowing sigh. &ldquo;Listen, obviously I can&rsquo;t make you do it, but would you at least consider?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I can do that,&rdquo; you tell him, and his dimples aren&rsquo;t long in being on full display. He drops the topic after that and the two of you spend the remainder of the evening watching movies and eating the cold leftover pizza, before eventually cutting yourselves off the wine once you&rsquo;ve finished half of the third bottle in less than twenty minutes. </p><p>Harry is the first to fall asleep with his head leant against the armrest on his end of the couch, but you lay awake thinking about what he&rsquo;s asked you to do and consider possible outcomes. Soon enough, you allow yourself to accept the fact that maybe it won&rsquo;t be as bad as you&rsquo;re thinking it will be, and eventually fall asleep curled up by your best friend on the opposite end of the comfortable piece of furniture. </p><p>You wake up the next morning alone in the living room and are instantly confused. Without a moment to waste, you sit up straight on the couch and take in Harry&rsquo;s notable absence. The throw blanket that usually stays draped over the back of chair in the corner of the room lays across your lap, and you know it was Harry that put it there. Before you become too worried as to where he could&rsquo;ve gone; his distinctive voice rings from behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Good, you&rsquo;re awake,&rdquo; he greets with a large dimpled grin as you turn around to see him peaking his head out from the kitchen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making waffles.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you just quote Donkey from Shrek?&rdquo; You groan as you stretch your arms high above your head to crack your stiff back, before reaching down to rub at your tired eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;But I actually did so come get some.&rdquo;</p><p>You can&rsquo;t help the smile that takes over your mouth as you stand up and slowly shuffle towards the kitchen to get some of the waffles that smell really good. The small dinner table that is set against the outer wall of the kitchen is filled with various plates of fruit, toast, bacon, and eggs so naturally you have to steal one of the appetizing looking clementine&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s set out; playing catch with it a couple times until you reach the doorway. &ldquo;Really trying to butter me up about this whole thing, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>He freezes in his position of holding the carton of orange juice he was preparing to pour into the two glasses he has set beside a plate stacked with toaster waffles, and slowly moves his gaze to you. &ldquo;I- ok yeah. I thought-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really didn&rsquo;t have to do this Harry,&rdquo; you cut him off and try to ignore the butterflies that are fluttering in your stomach again. </p><p>&ldquo;I know but I wanted to do something nice because I really am asking a lot from you to do this whole thing, and m&rsquo;not going to be mad if you say no or anything seeing as you&rsquo;d literally have to pretend to be in a relationship with me but-,&rdquo; he mindlessly rambles but stops when you step forward and cut him off for a second time. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p>He looks at you in pure shock before he sets down the juice, and his expression melts into the all too familiar grin that you love so much. &ldquo;You will?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you tell him while nodding your head and smiling widely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be&hellip; fun. And what kind of friend would I be if I let you pretend to be in a relationship with someone you can&rsquo;t stand?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The worst kind,&rdquo; he replies jokingly before taking a couple strides and engulfing you into a tight hug. &ldquo;Thank you, Y/N. Really. You don&rsquo;t know how much that means to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Glad I can help,&rdquo; you respond and lean into his chest. The two of you stay like that for a moment before realizing just exactly what is going on, and both slowly move away. You can&nbsp;feel the elephant that&rsquo;s beginning to form in the room and are quick in changing the subject to avoid any further awkwardness. &ldquo;Ok now I&rsquo;m ready for all this food.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dig on in then,&rdquo; he tells you, and you oblige. You exit back into the main living space and sit at the table, quickly stacking your plate with a little bit of everything. Harry joins and the two of you enjoy the breakfast he&rsquo;s made in comfortable silence. Once you&rsquo;re both done eating you start tackling the dishes in order to stick to the agreement of whoever cooks doesn&rsquo;t have to clean whenever the two of you hang out together. He brings the last of the dishes back into the kitchen and places them into the sink, before glancing around and talking again. &ldquo;S&rsquo;alright if I hop in the shower? Jeff wants to meet up with us to talk a game plan for everything if that&rsquo;s ok with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you answer softly and move to turn off the sinks running water. &ldquo;You know where it is.&rdquo;</p><p>He just smiles and nods before going to head out of the room, but his movements suddenly halt, and he quickly turns back around to face you again. No words leave his mouth as he steps towards you and leans down to place the softest kiss on your temple. &ldquo;Thank you again for doing this petal.&rdquo;</p><p>This time, no words come from you as he turns around and exits the kitchen; mainly because you&rsquo;re too busy choking on those words as they become stuck in your throat. You stay still for a moment until you hear the bathroom door close from down the hallway and let out the deep breath you didn&rsquo;t realize you were holding in. &ldquo;Holy fuck,&rdquo; you whisper to yourself before finally getting started at cleaning the dishes and thinking to yourself of how this is all going to be quite the show. </p><p>taglist (I freaking love all of you): <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_zkOpOkuuOk8RfJbhzZGYQ\">@trulymadlysydney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhtayn5WnNlRHHG8U7FG03A\">@foreverhlessed</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp1pFk9bhKh1jZIZ80Z2hiA\">@silklaurentharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFHkU95pgVE5U-iUtvcUt7Q\">@physically-im-fine</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcG7LNLDLGpUUvGyz6N0x2w\">@drowninherperfume</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mySnJBAbOkyxfKQXid3CZFw\">@valenvitrian</a> @letmereid&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq9XkL-P28R-8xe2qX03sAw\">@allthelovexxharry</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIvRIBhQCQZZn9ZFHkqZh-Q\">@sushiabby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkYVZGfl7MA8ME5IxZ7jvRw\">@hiddlestylesbaby</a> @amiablestyles <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTF3VmtFjzS-TSXlP98CO2A\">@karleedaniels27</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt8UgKFohCm9j0NHHigjuQA\">@theregionofthesummerxstars</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKB9oolYg0a3qnq9TGxtr1A\">@delusionalmusichoe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSwfx5lREEHpoyErp7D7R7w\">@mystxrieux</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu56pgniswtzaG8gpePIUfg\">@zoynxedo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpeESTliEgX248s3dSNTpHg\">@blackmilkshake</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlOUT0GA6dntyCdhkgxk1ZA\">@spencer-is-too-perfect</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md6__mRUQVgVE_qj36evVBA\">@justanotherdaydreamersoul</a> </p></p>",
