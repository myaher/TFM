                "content": "<p>Why do so many people in the fandom think Sansa owes Tyrion love? I find it incredibly gross how many people route for Sanrion like it would be a healthy relationship for either of them. I understand that the show didn&rsquo;t quite accuratly depict Tyrion as a bad person he is but he was by no means a saint or owed anything. Everyone who ships them for some reason thinks that Sansa owes him her love and body because they deluded them selves into believing it is owed to him due to his few incidents of kindness or because of his treatment by his family. They casually ignore all of the glaringly obvious reasons why Sansa especially owes him anything. And they for some reason think that Sansa not loving him is a flaw in her character, saying ablism is why she won&rsquo;t sleep with him.<br /></p><p>Tyrion is not a good person GRRM himself called him a villain. Tyrion does many awful things especially to Sansa and her family. He raped a slave in Essos, He is given a young woman known only as the &ldquo;<i>sunset girl</i>,&rdquo; and her back is covered from the scars of previous whippings. You know he know what he is doing is wrong because Tyrion mentally noting that &ldquo;<i>she did not prove the liveliest of partners</i>&rdquo; and that she had eyes that &ldquo;<i>looked dead</i>.&rdquo; Knowing she&rsquo;s punished for disobeying her masters, Tyrion thinks he has just had sex with a dead woman. He&rsquo;s filled with shame and thinks &ldquo;<i>this was a mistake</i>&rdquo;&hellip; which doesn&rsquo;t keep him from raping her again, after which she runs away. Unlike in the tv show it is quite obvious that Shea doesn&rsquo;t love him to everyone even Tyrion doesn&rsquo;t believe she actually loves him. Then he kills her because she &ldquo;betrayed&rdquo; him in the show she reaches for a knife this doesn&rsquo;t happen in the book. What do you think would happen to Shea if she refused Cersei or Tywin? The fact that at is trail he had an outburst and says he wished to poison them all.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s without mentioning all his crimes against Sansa. He helps keep Sansa imprisioned in kings landing while yes he has a reason for doing this it still is not a good thing. For some bizarre reason everyone like pretending that he is just as much of a prisoner as Sansa which is laughable. He actively plots against her family while yes he didn&rsquo;t plot the red wedding the death of Sansa&rsquo;s family was one of the things he wanted. Then you get to there wedding where he married a 12 year old girl against her will. He embarrassed her by getting drunk. Then joke about raping her. He says,&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, wife, time to smash your portcullis. I want to play come-into-the-castle.&rdquo;. He knows that anything that happens between them is not consensual but still he jokes about it to her like it wouldn&rsquo;t scare her. Then he molested his 12 YEAR OLD, CHILD BRIDE and stops seconds from actually raping her and the awful thing is that the reason he stops is more to do with his feelings and the fact that unlike other women she can&rsquo;t fake interest in him.

Giggling. Whispering. It was coming from an empty\nchamber. Choruses of \u201cshh!\u201d \u201cshh!\u201d and more guffawing. She was on her way to a\ncouncil with Jon and the others but her curiosity got the best of her and she\nstopped outside of the room in question, its door half-closed, and saw a few\nservants huddled together.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nmean, it makes sense doesn\u2019t it?

She sighed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI<i> know</i> that you\u2019re all gossiping in here,\njust tell me what it is.\u201d </p><p>Two servants\nexchanged nervous glances. \u201cForgive us, Lady Stark&mdash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in any\ntrouble,\u201d she said with a slight smile. \u201cI\u2019m just \u2026 curious. Indulge me.\u201d</p><p>A woman started to\nspeak. \u201cLady Stark, we \u2026 \u2026 we heard a rumour&mdash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Sansa,\nnodding. \u201cThat much has been made clear.\u201d She regarded them. \u201cOut with it.\u201d </p><p>There was another\npause before the woman continued speaking. \u201cOne of the servants, I\u2019m not sure\nwho exactly, heard some of the boat crew talking,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa stared at\nher. Her heart began to race as dread creeped up on her and started squeezing\nher chest: maybe she didn\u2019t want to hear the answer. Maybe it was a rumour that\nwould shatter something inside of her. It was the only explanation for the\nsense of impending doom that was disrupting her body.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace, Lord\nSnow, he and the Targaryen woman \u2026 they \u2026 they had <i>relations</i> on the boat\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat is the\ngossip anyway, my Lady,\u201d said a man. </p><p>Nothing could have\nprepared Sansa for those words; they struck her like a slap and she felt winded\nwith the impact. More than that she felt betrayed in a way she hadn\u2019t expected.\nThere was an intimacy to her sense of betrayal, an intimacy that shook her\nbecause it made her feel as if Jon had been unfaithful rather than traitorous, <i>adulterous</i> even and that only spawned a\nfamiliar confusion in Sansa, the one that had plagued her after every\ninteraction she\u2019d had with Jon since he came back. </p><p>It was as if her\ninsides were being ripped apart with the whirlwind of conflicting emotions and all\nshe could do to hold herself together was remove herself from them, block\nherself from the surprising pain and all of its implications, turn herself into\nsteel, into that statuesque demeanour she found herself inhabiting more and\nmore. </p><p> \u201cThank you, that will be all,\u201d she said. Her\njaw tight. \u201cYou can get back to your duties.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Jon sat opposite Daenerys at a long\nwooden table covered with maps and documents. He was staring down at nothing in\nparticular, stewing in a broody silence that infected the entire room. Daenerys\nhad seen moments of this beforehand but nothing quite so long-lasting. </p><p>\u201cIt is unlike\nSansa to be late,\u201d he said.</p><p>Daenerys regarded\nhim. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2026\u201d He\ngesticulated. <i>\u201cRegretful</i> that we\nhaven\u2019t been getting along lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of me,\u201d\nsaid Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cNo, because she\ndoesn\u2019t trust me. Because she\u2019s stubborn. Because she doesn\u2019t have faith in my\nloyalty to&mdash;\u201d He cut himself off and shook his head.</p><p>Daenerys saw the\nheartbreak in Jon\u2019s eyes as he said those words, heard the way his voice\nquickened with frustration and with a need, even then, to make his sister\nunderstand his choices &mdash; he was always with Sansa, he carried her with him,\nand all of their impassioned discussions. </p><p>\u201cWell anyone with\neyes could see how much you love \u2026\u201d she licked her lips. \u201cThe North,\u201d she\nfinished diplomatically. \u201cPerhaps she just needed some time to gain\nperspective.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then she\nwould\u2019ve done it after the meeting not before,\u201d said Jon gruffly. </p><p>The door opened\nand he started but when he saw Davos walk in the room, he sat back in his\nchair, crestfallen.</p><p> \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said swiftly. He stopped in\nthe middle of the room and spoke just as quickly. </p><p>\u201cYou need to talk\nto your crew. They\u2019re undisciplined and they have big mouths.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys stood up.\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d </p><p>Jon raised his\nhands in a calming manner, looking from Daenerys to Davos and then spoke. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere seems to be\na rumour going around,\u201d said Davos. </p><p>Daenerys looked at\nhim, her head cocked upward and Jon narrowed his eyes at Davos\u2019 awkward\nexpression. </p><p>\u201cA rumour that you\ntwo had \u2026\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t need Davos\nto finish the sentence. Everything inside of him shifted. He could hear\nDaenerys scoff at the accusations, at Davos discussing methods to suppress the\ngossip but their words were distant echoes in his ears. He suddenly felt sick\nwith worry, with anxiety.</p><p>\u201cDid Sansa hear?\u201d he\nwhispered.</p><p>They continued to\ntalk. </p><p> He cleared his throat. \u201cDid Sansa hear?\u201d he\nsaid more loudly.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Davos\nshrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if any of your siblings heard, Your Grace, right now it\nseems to be confined to the common folk, I &mdash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find\nher,\u201d said Jon. He looked to Daenerys. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Jon walked into Sansa\u2019s room\nwithout knocking, closing the door behind him. She was sitting at her desk, looking\nover documents. Although he was restless, he didn\u2019t dare speak but she did\nnothing to acknowledge his presence in her chambers. He wanted to pace but he\nalso wanted to stay still, he wanted to shout at her to look at him but he also\nwanted to give her the first word. He was unusually ambivalent and unusually\nfrazzled and he couldn\u2019t understand the guilt that was the source of his\nagitation. </p><p>Finally, she\nspoke.</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d\nshe asked quietly, her eyes still on the document in front her.</p><p>\u201cSansa&mdash;-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo. You. <i>Love.</i> Her.\u201d </p><p>Jon sighed and\nhung his head then took a couple of steps closer to her desk. Finally she\nlooked at him. Her eyes blazing with that wintry fire he so admired, that\nwintry fire that contradicted the coolness of her speech. She shrugged her\nshoulders. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if\nit would make this mean something or feel like it means something if you were\nin love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell surely,\u201d she\nleaned back in her chair and shook her head, \u201cif you are going to give away our\nautonomy, our freedom, it should be for love, should it not?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSansa.\u201d </i></p><p>She stood up and\nslammed her hands on the desk. \u201cYou tried to make me feel like a fool for\nquestioning your motivations for this decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you <i>were</i> being a bit foolish,\u201d Jon snapped\nback. \u201cYou\u2019re being foolish right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she\nyelled. Her pretence of aloofness cracking. \u201cBecause the last time someone from\nour family made a decision based on a woman, he ended up dead! My mother ended\nup dead! Northerners ended up dead! I told you you had to be smarter than\nFather, that you had to be smarter than Robb! And you\u2019re making the same\nmistakes&mdash;\u201d </p><p>Jon slammed his\nhands on the desk now too, his face inches away from Sansa\u2019s. \u201cI am not making\nthe same mistakes!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI would never do anything to put the North at\nrisk, to put Arya and Bran at risk, to put <i>you</i>\nat risk, Sansa! How many times do we have to have the same argument?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cUntil you convince me!\u201d </i>The shrillness\nof her own yelling surprised Sansa, it was a mark of how personal she was\ntaking the entire situation and she tried to regain some emotional distance.</p><p> \u201cDo you know how weak this makes us look? The\nKing in the North now a puppet because he doesn\u2019t think with his head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, that\u2019s <i>enough!\u201d</i> He took a beat. \u201cI would never&mdash;!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re too\nblinded that you don\u2019t even see it!\u201d</p><p>Swiftly, Sansa wrenched\nher eyes from Jon\u2019s gaze and turned her back to him, rubbing her forehead with\nher right hand. She was feverish, her skin was hot to the touch. </p><p>\u201cToo blinded to\nsee what?\u201d said Jon. </p><p>He waited for a\nresponse and when he didn\u2019t get one, something in him compelled him to shout. <i>\u201cWhat am I too blinded to see?\u201d </i></p><p>Sansa whirled around.\n\u201cThat you have chosen her!\u201d she yelled. \u201cOver &mdash; over&mdash;\u201d <i>Me,</i> she screamed internally. <i>You\nchose an outsider over me! And I </i>hate<i>\nit and I don\u2019t know why I hate it </i>this<i>\nmuch!</i></p><p>Jon walked around\nthe desk to her, he touched her shoulder but she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of\nhim holding her with the same hands he held <i>her</i>\nand she stepped out of his reach. While Jon itched to try again, he stayed\nwhere he was, giving her the space that she demanded, as he had and would\ncontinue to ensure that never again would she be touched unless she\u2019d wanted to\nbe.</p><p>She stared at him,\nbreathing heavily and he shook his head, doing his best to calm the rage within\nhim. He took a step toward her and stopped, maintaining a distance. \u201cI&mdash;\u201d he\npressed his lips together. \u201cI never knew you thought so little of me.\u201d </p><p>She rolled her\neyes. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d he\ncountered. \u201cIf you so \u2026 passionately believe that I would put everything and\neveryone at risk for something as crude as sex or as selfish as love then I &mdash;\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cSo you <i>do</i> love her,\u201d she said severely, her\neyes flashing. </p><p>He looked at her\nwearily. \u201cLook, I loved a woman once,\u201d he said. \n\u201cA Wildling woman, her name was Ygritte and even my love for her couldn\u2019t\ncome before my duty to the Night\u2019s Watch, what makes you think anything can\ncome before my duty to &mdash;\u201d <i>You.</i> \u201cMy people?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cYou love her,\u201d\nshe repeated.</p><p>Jon gritted his\nteeth, opening and closing his fists. \u201cWhy do you keep <i>saying </i>that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you\ndeny it?\u201d she retorted.</p><p>He looked at her,\nhis mouth agape, as something &mdash; a new emotion &mdash; tickled his chest. Something\nthat felt a bit like hope or a bit like delight. </p><p>\u201cThe possibility\nbothers you that much?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe no more\nthan how much seeing me dance with Lord Cerwyn bothered you,\u201d she said harshly.\n</p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t know\nwhat she was saying before she\u2019d said it and almost said something to take it\nback but when she saw the way Jon\u2019s face darkened, she realized this was the\nreaction she wanted from him. </p><p>\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s\nthe same thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhich is what\nexactly? Love or camaraderie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being <i>impossible,</i> Sansa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, it\nprobably isn\u2019t the same, Jon.\u201d Her words were spilling out of her. \u201cConsidering\nthat I would never put him before you and you love your silver-haired queened\nmore than&mdash;-\u201d </p><p> \u201cThan <i>what?\u201d</i>\nhe said, his anger returning. \u201cMore than what, Sansa, I want to hear you say\nit.\u201d He touched her wrist and when she didn\u2019t move away this time, he took both\nof her hands in his, her nails digging into his skin. </p><p>\u201cI want to hear\nyou say your cruelest insult to me!\u201d he said, leaning into her face. </p><p>She jutted hers\ninto his. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an insult if it\u2019s the truth!\u201d</p><p> \u201cYou believing something so stubbornly doesn\u2019t\nmake it true!\u201d he said, holding onto her tighter. \u201cI would <i>never</i> betray you.\u201d He looked at her with an earnestness so fierce\nit made her legs weak. \u201cI would never &mdash; I would <i>never</i> put anyone else above you! I would never see you in danger <i>ever </i>again.

She sighed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI<i> know</i> that you\u2019re all gossiping in here,\njust tell me what it is.\u201d </p><p>Two servants\nexchanged nervous glances. \u201cForgive us, Lady Stark\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in any\ntrouble,\u201d she said with a slight smile. \u201cI\u2019m just \u2026 curious. Indulge me.\u201d</p><p>A woman started to\nspeak. \u201cLady Stark, we \u2026 \u2026 we heard a rumour\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Sansa,\nnodding. \u201cThat much has been made clear.\u201d She regarded them. \u201cOut with it.\u201d </p><p>There was another\npause before the woman continued speaking. \u201cOne of the servants, I\u2019m not sure\nwho exactly, heard some of the boat crew talking,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa stared at\nher. Her heart began to race as dread creeped up on her and started squeezing\nher chest: maybe she didn\u2019t want to hear the answer. Maybe it was a rumour that\nwould shatter something inside of her. It was the only explanation for the\nsense of impending doom that was disrupting her body.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace, Lord\nSnow, he and the Targaryen woman \u2026 they \u2026 they had <i>relations</i> on the boat\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat is the\ngossip anyway, my Lady,\u201d said a man. </p><p>Nothing could have\nprepared Sansa for those words; they struck her like a slap and she felt winded\nwith the impact. More than that she felt betrayed in a way she hadn\u2019t expected.\nThere was an intimacy to her sense of betrayal, an intimacy that shook her\nbecause it made her feel as if Jon had been unfaithful rather than traitorous, <i>adulterous</i> even and that only spawned a\nfamiliar confusion in Sansa, the one that had plagued her after every\ninteraction she\u2019d had with Jon since he came back. </p><p>It was as if her\ninsides were being ripped apart with the whirlwind of conflicting emotions and all\nshe could do to hold herself together was remove herself from them, block\nherself from the surprising pain and all of its implications, turn herself into\nsteel, into that statuesque demeanour she found herself inhabiting more and\nmore. </p><p> \u201cThank you, that will be all,\u201d she said. Her\njaw tight. \u201cYou can get back to your duties.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Jon sat opposite Daenerys at a long\nwooden table covered with maps and documents. He was staring down at nothing in\nparticular, stewing in a broody silence that infected the entire room. Daenerys\nhad seen moments of this beforehand but nothing quite so long-lasting. </p><p>\u201cIt is unlike\nSansa to be late,\u201d he said.</p><p>Daenerys regarded\nhim. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2026\u201d He\ngesticulated. <i>\u201cRegretful</i> that we\nhaven\u2019t been getting along lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of me,\u201d\nsaid Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cNo, because she\ndoesn\u2019t trust me. Because she\u2019s stubborn. Because she doesn\u2019t have faith in my\nloyalty to\u2014\u201d He cut himself off and shook his head.</p><p>Daenerys saw the\nheartbreak in Jon\u2019s eyes as he said those words, heard the way his voice\nquickened with frustration and with a need, even then, to make his sister\nunderstand his choices \u2014 he was always with Sansa, he carried her with him,\nand all of their impassioned discussions. </p><p>\u201cWell anyone with\neyes could see how much you love \u2026\u201d she licked her lips. \u201cThe North,\u201d she\nfinished diplomatically. \u201cPerhaps she just needed some time to gain\nperspective.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then she\nwould\u2019ve done it after the meeting not before,\u201d said Jon gruffly. </p><p>The door opened\nand he started but when he saw Davos walk in the room, he sat back in his\nchair, crestfallen.</p><p> \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said swiftly. He stopped in\nthe middle of the room and spoke just as quickly. </p><p>\u201cYou need to talk\nto your crew. They\u2019re undisciplined and they have big mouths.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys stood up.\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d </p><p>Jon raised his\nhands in a calming manner, looking from Daenerys to Davos and then spoke. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere seems to be\na rumour going around,\u201d said Davos. </p><p>Daenerys looked at\nhim, her head cocked upward and Jon narrowed his eyes at Davos\u2019 awkward\nexpression. </p><p>\u201cA rumour that you\ntwo had \u2026\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t need Davos\nto finish the sentence. Everything inside of him shifted. He could hear\nDaenerys scoff at the accusations, at Davos discussing methods to suppress the\ngossip but their words were distant echoes in his ears. He suddenly felt sick\nwith worry, with anxiety.</p><p>\u201cDid Sansa hear?\u201d he\nwhispered.</p><p>They continued to\ntalk. </p><p> He cleared his throat. \u201cDid Sansa hear?\u201d he\nsaid more loudly.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Davos\nshrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if any of your siblings heard, Your Grace, right now it\nseems to be confined to the common folk, I \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find\nher,\u201d said Jon. He looked to Daenerys. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Jon walked into Sansa\u2019s room\nwithout knocking, closing the door behind him. She was sitting at her desk, looking\nover documents. Although he was restless, he didn\u2019t dare speak but she did\nnothing to acknowledge his presence in her chambers. He wanted to pace but he\nalso wanted to stay still, he wanted to shout at her to look at him but he also\nwanted to give her the first word. He was unusually ambivalent and unusually\nfrazzled and he couldn\u2019t understand the guilt that was the source of his\nagitation. </p><p>Finally, she\nspoke.</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d\nshe asked quietly, her eyes still on the document in front her.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2014-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo. You. <i>Love.</i> Her.\u201d </p><p>Jon sighed and\nhung his head then took a couple of steps closer to her desk. Finally she\nlooked at him. Her eyes blazing with that wintry fire he so admired, that\nwintry fire that contradicted the coolness of her speech. She shrugged her\nshoulders. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if\nit would make this mean something or feel like it means something if you were\nin love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell surely,\u201d she\nleaned back in her chair and shook her head, \u201cif you are going to give away our\nautonomy, our freedom, it should be for love, should it not?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSansa.\u201d </i></p><p>She stood up and\nslammed her hands on the desk. \u201cYou tried to make me feel like a fool for\nquestioning your motivations for this decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you <i>were</i> being a bit foolish,\u201d Jon snapped\nback. \u201cYou\u2019re being foolish right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she\nyelled. Her pretence of aloofness cracking. \u201cBecause the last time someone from\nour family made a decision based on a woman, he ended up dead! My mother ended\nup dead! Northerners ended up dead! I told you you had to be smarter than\nFather, that you had to be smarter than Robb! And you\u2019re making the same\nmistakes\u2014\u201d </p><p>Jon slammed his\nhands on the desk now too, his face inches away from Sansa\u2019s. \u201cI am not making\nthe same mistakes!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI would never do anything to put the North at\nrisk, to put Arya and Bran at risk, to put <i>you</i>\nat risk, Sansa! How many times do we have to have the same argument?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cUntil you convince me!\u201d </i>The shrillness\nof her own yelling surprised Sansa, it was a mark of how personal she was\ntaking the entire situation and she tried to regain some emotional distance.</p><p> \u201cDo you know how weak this makes us look? The\nKing in the North now a puppet because he doesn\u2019t think with his head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, that\u2019s <i>enough!\u201d</i> He took a beat. \u201cI would never\u2014!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re too\nblinded that you don\u2019t even see it!\u201d</p><p>Swiftly, Sansa wrenched\nher eyes from Jon\u2019s gaze and turned her back to him, rubbing her forehead with\nher right hand. She was feverish, her skin was hot to the touch. </p><p>\u201cToo blinded to\nsee what?\u201d said Jon. </p><p>He waited for a\nresponse and when he didn\u2019t get one, something in him compelled him to shout. <i>\u201cWhat am I too blinded to see?\u201d </i></p><p>Sansa whirled around.\n\u201cThat you have chosen her!\u201d she yelled. \u201cOver \u2014 over\u2014\u201d <i>Me,</i> she screamed internally. <i>You\nchose an outsider over me! And I </i>hate<i>\nit and I don\u2019t know why I hate it </i>this<i>\nmuch!</i></p><p>Jon walked around\nthe desk to her, he touched her shoulder but she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of\nhim holding her with the same hands he held <i>her</i>\nand she stepped out of his reach. While Jon itched to try again, he stayed\nwhere he was, giving her the space that she demanded, as he had and would\ncontinue to ensure that never again would she be touched unless she\u2019d wanted to\nbe.</p><p>She stared at him,\nbreathing heavily and he shook his head, doing his best to calm the rage within\nhim. He took a step toward her and stopped, maintaining a distance. \u201cI\u2014\u201d he\npressed his lips together. \u201cI never knew you thought so little of me.\u201d </p><p>She rolled her\neyes. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d he\ncountered. \u201cIf you so \u2026 passionately believe that I would put everything and\neveryone at risk for something as crude as sex or as selfish as love then I \u2014\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cSo you <i>do</i> love her,\u201d she said severely, her\neyes flashing. </p><p>He looked at her\nwearily. \u201cLook, I loved a woman once,\u201d he said. \n\u201cA Wildling woman, her name was Ygritte and even my love for her couldn\u2019t\ncome before my duty to the Night\u2019s Watch, what makes you think anything can\ncome before my duty to \u2014\u201d <i>You.</i> \u201cMy people?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cYou love her,\u201d\nshe repeated.</p><p>Jon gritted his\nteeth, opening and closing his fists. \u201cWhy do you keep <i>saying </i>that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you\ndeny it?\u201d she retorted.</p><p>He looked at her,\nhis mouth agape, as something \u2014 a new emotion \u2014 tickled his chest. Something\nthat felt a bit like hope or a bit like delight. </p><p>\u201cThe possibility\nbothers you that much?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe no more\nthan how much seeing me dance with Lord Cerwyn bothered you,\u201d she said harshly.\n</p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t know\nwhat she was saying before she\u2019d said it and almost said something to take it\nback but when she saw the way Jon\u2019s face darkened, she realized this was the\nreaction she wanted from him. </p><p>\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s\nthe same thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhich is what\nexactly? Love or camaraderie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being <i>impossible,</i> Sansa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, it\nprobably isn\u2019t the same, Jon.\u201d Her words were spilling out of her. \u201cConsidering\nthat I would never put him before you and you love your silver-haired queened\nmore than\u2014-\u201d </p><p> \u201cThan <i>what?\u201d</i>\nhe said, his anger returning. \u201cMore than what, Sansa, I want to hear you say\nit.\u201d He touched her wrist and when she didn\u2019t move away this time, he took both\nof her hands in his, her nails digging into his skin. </p><p>\u201cI want to hear\nyou say your cruelest insult to me!\u201d he said, leaning into her face. </p><p>She jutted hers\ninto his. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an insult if it\u2019s the truth!\u201d</p><p> \u201cYou believing something so stubbornly doesn\u2019t\nmake it true!\u201d he said, holding onto her tighter. \u201cI would <i>never</i> betray you.\u201d He looked at her with an earnestness so fierce\nit made her legs weak. \u201cI would never \u2014 I would <i>never</i> put anyone else above you! I would never see you in danger <i>ever </i>again. I would never\u2026 I would never\n\u2014\u201d</p><p>Neither of them\nknew who moved forward first only that they\u2019d come together in a breathless\nembrace that ignited a spark within both of them. Jon\u2019s hands no longer held\nSansa\u2019s, instead they held either side of her face while Sansa\u2019s hands gripped\nhis wrists, her body bowed toward him. </p><p>It was a kiss as\ncontradictory as everything before it; the softness of Jon\u2019s lips, the feel of\nthem on her own unwound Sansa as release surged through her \u2014 the taste of\nher tongue, the way her hands clenched his own filled Jon with an unparalleled\nrelish but these emotions also triggered others, triggered questions they could\nfeel rise within them, triggered more agitation, more \u2026 passion \u2014 it did\nnothing to satiate. </p><p>Finally, they\nparted and Sansa sank toward the desk as Jon walked swiftly over to a wall so\nhe could sag his weight against something solid.

He looked to Daenerys. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Jon walked into Sansa\u2019s room\nwithout knocking, closing the door behind him. She was sitting at her desk, looking\nover documents. Although he was restless, he didn\u2019t dare speak but she did\nnothing to acknowledge his presence in her chambers. He wanted to pace but he\nalso wanted to stay still, he wanted to shout at her to look at him but he also\nwanted to give her the first word. He was unusually ambivalent and unusually\nfrazzled and he couldn\u2019t understand the guilt that was the source of his\nagitation. </p><p>Finally, she\nspoke.</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d\nshe asked quietly, her eyes still on the document in front her.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2014-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo. You. <i>Love.</i> Her.\u201d </p><p>Jon sighed and\nhung his head then took a couple of steps closer to her desk. Finally she\nlooked at him. Her eyes blazing with that wintry fire he so admired, that\nwintry fire that contradicted the coolness of her speech. She shrugged her\nshoulders. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if\nit would make this mean something or feel like it means something if you were\nin love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell surely,\u201d she\nleaned back in her chair and shook her head, \u201cif you are going to give away our\nautonomy, our freedom, it should be for love, should it not?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSansa.\u201d </i></p><p>She stood up and\nslammed her hands on the desk. \u201cYou tried to make me feel like a fool for\nquestioning your motivations for this decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you <i>were</i> being a bit foolish,\u201d Jon snapped\nback. \u201cYou\u2019re being foolish right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she\nyelled. Her pretence of aloofness cracking. \u201cBecause the last time someone from\nour family made a decision based on a woman, he ended up dead! My mother ended\nup dead! Northerners ended up dead! I told you you had to be smarter than\nFather, that you had to be smarter than Robb! And you\u2019re making the same\nmistakes\u2014\u201d </p><p>Jon slammed his\nhands on the desk now too, his face inches away from Sansa\u2019s. \u201cI am not making\nthe same mistakes!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI would never do anything to put the North at\nrisk, to put Arya and Bran at risk, to put <i>you</i>\nat risk, Sansa! How many times do we have to have the same argument?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cUntil you convince me!\u201d </i>The shrillness\nof her own yelling surprised Sansa, it was a mark of how personal she was\ntaking the entire situation and she tried to regain some emotional distance.</p><p> \u201cDo you know how weak this makes us look? The\nKing in the North now a puppet because he doesn\u2019t think with his head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, that\u2019s <i>enough!\u201d</i> He took a beat. \u201cI would never\u2014!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re too\nblinded that you don\u2019t even see it!\u201d</p><p>Swiftly, Sansa wrenched\nher eyes from Jon\u2019s gaze and turned her back to him, rubbing her forehead with\nher right hand. She was feverish, her skin was hot to the touch. </p><p>\u201cToo blinded to\nsee what?\u201d said Jon. </p><p>He waited for a\nresponse and when he didn\u2019t get one, something in him compelled him to shout. <i>\u201cWhat am I too blinded to see?\u201d </i></p><p>Sansa whirled around.\n\u201cThat you have chosen her!\u201d she yelled. \u201cOver \u2014 over\u2014\u201d <i>Me,</i> she screamed internally. <i>You\nchose an outsider over me! And I </i>hate<i>\nit and I don\u2019t know why I hate it </i>this<i>\nmuch!</i></p><p>Jon walked around\nthe desk to her, he touched her shoulder but she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of\nhim holding her with the same hands he held <i>her</i>\nand she stepped out of his reach. While Jon itched to try again, he stayed\nwhere he was, giving her the space that she demanded, as he had and would\ncontinue to ensure that never again would she be touched unless she\u2019d wanted to\nbe.</p><p>She stared at him,\nbreathing heavily and he shook his head, doing his best to calm the rage within\nhim. He took a step toward her and stopped, maintaining a distance. \u201cI\u2014\u201d he\npressed his lips together. \u201cI never knew you thought so little of me.\u201d </p><p>She rolled her\neyes. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d he\ncountered. \u201cIf you so \u2026 passionately believe that I would put everything and\neveryone at risk for something as crude as sex or as selfish as love then I \u2014\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cSo you <i>do</i> love her,\u201d she said severely, her\neyes flashing. </p><p>He looked at her\nwearily. \u201cLook, I loved a woman once,\u201d he said. \n\u201cA Wildling woman, her name was Ygritte and even my love for her couldn\u2019t\ncome before my duty to the Night\u2019s Watch, what makes you think anything can\ncome before my duty to \u2014\u201d <i>You.</i> \u201cMy people?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cYou love her,\u201d\nshe repeated.</p><p>Jon gritted his\nteeth, opening and closing his fists. \u201cWhy do you keep <i>saying </i>that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you\ndeny it?\u201d she retorted.</p><p>He looked at her,\nhis mouth agape, as something \u2014 a new emotion \u2014 tickled his chest. Something\nthat felt a bit like hope or a bit like delight. </p><p>\u201cThe possibility\nbothers you that much?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe no more\nthan how much seeing me dance with Lord Cerwyn bothered you,\u201d she said harshly.\n</p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t know\nwhat she was saying before she\u2019d said it and almost said something to take it\nback but when she saw the way Jon\u2019s face darkened, she realized this was the\nreaction she wanted from him. </p><p>\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s\nthe same thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhich is what\nexactly? Love or camaraderie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being <i>impossible,</i> Sansa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, it\nprobably isn\u2019t the same, Jon.\u201d Her words were spilling out of her. \u201cConsidering\nthat I would never put him before you and you love your silver-haired queened\nmore than\u2014-\u201d </p><p> \u201cThan <i>what?\u201d</i>\nhe said, his anger returning. \u201cMore than what, Sansa, I want to hear you say\nit.\u201d He touched her wrist and when she didn\u2019t move away this time, he took both\nof her hands in his, her nails digging into his skin. </p><p>\u201cI want to hear\nyou say your cruelest insult to me!\u201d he said, leaning into her face. </p><p>She jutted hers\ninto his. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an insult if it\u2019s the truth!\u201d</p><p> \u201cYou believing something so stubbornly doesn\u2019t\nmake it true!\u201d he said, holding onto her tighter. \u201cI would <i>never</i> betray you.\u201d He looked at her with an earnestness so fierce\nit made her legs weak. \u201cI would never \u2014 I would <i>never</i> put anyone else above you! I would never see you in danger <i>ever </i>again. I would never\u2026 I would never\n\u2014\u201d</p><p>Neither of them\nknew who moved forward first only that they\u2019d come together in a breathless\nembrace that ignited a spark within both of them. Jon\u2019s hands no longer held\nSansa\u2019s, instead they held either side of her face while Sansa\u2019s hands gripped\nhis wrists, her body bowed toward him. </p><p>It was a kiss as\ncontradictory as everything before it; the softness of Jon\u2019s lips, the feel of\nthem on her own unwound Sansa as release surged through her \u2014 the taste of\nher tongue, the way her hands clenched his own filled Jon with an unparalleled\nrelish but these emotions also triggered others, triggered questions they could\nfeel rise within them, triggered more agitation, more \u2026 passion \u2014 it did\nnothing to satiate. </p><p>Finally, they\nparted and Sansa sank toward the desk as Jon walked swiftly over to a wall so\nhe could sag his weight against something solid. Now that they were apart, they\ncould breathe again and they each took in the air with a gluttonous enthusiasm,\ntrying to calm their thundering hearts, dry their teary eyes, still their\nracing minds. They dared not look at each other because now that they were\napart, they could feel the pull between them; within each of them was an urge\nto snap back together, an urge so intense it was like a humming on their skin. </p><p>And afraid of what\nwould happen if they stayed in the same place, afraid at his own longing to\nfind out, to go to her, Jon hastily left the room without looking back to see\nSansa gripping the desk with one hand and clutching her chest with the other.</p>",

He suddenly felt sick\nwith worry, with anxiety.</p><p>&ldquo;Did Sansa hear?&rdquo; he\nwhispered.</p><p>They continued to\ntalk. </p><p> He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Did Sansa hear?&rdquo; he\nsaid more loudly.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; Davos\nshrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if any of your siblings heard, Your Grace, right now it\nseems to be confined to the common folk, I &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to find\nher,&rdquo; said Jon. He looked to Daenerys. &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jon walked into Sansa&rsquo;s room\nwithout knocking, closing the door behind him. She was sitting at her desk, looking\nover documents. Although he was restless, he didn&rsquo;t dare speak but she did\nnothing to acknowledge his presence in her chambers. He wanted to pace but he\nalso wanted to stay still, he wanted to shout at her to look at him but he also\nwanted to give her the first word. He was unusually ambivalent and unusually\nfrazzled and he couldn&rsquo;t understand the guilt that was the source of his\nagitation. </p><p>Finally, she\nspoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you love her?&rdquo;\nshe asked quietly, her eyes still on the document in front her.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa&mdash;-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do. You. <i>Love.</i> Her.&rdquo; </p><p>Jon sighed and\nhung his head then took a couple of steps closer to her desk. Finally she\nlooked at him. Her eyes blazing with that wintry fire he so admired, that\nwintry fire that contradicted the coolness of her speech. She shrugged her\nshoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if\nit would make this mean something or feel like it means something if you were\nin love with her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa, stop it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well surely,&rdquo; she\nleaned back in her chair and shook her head, &ldquo;if you are going to give away our\nautonomy, our freedom, it should be for love, should it not?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sansa.&rdquo; </i></p><p>She stood up and\nslammed her hands on the desk. &ldquo;You tried to make me feel like a fool for\nquestioning your motivations for this decision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you <i>were</i> being a bit foolish,&rdquo; Jon snapped\nback. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re being foolish right now!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; she\nyelled. Her pretence of aloofness cracking. &ldquo;Because the last time someone from\nour family made a decision based on a woman, he ended up dead! My mother ended\nup dead! Northerners ended up dead! I told you you had to be smarter than\nFather, that you had to be smarter than Robb! And you&rsquo;re making the same\nmistakes&mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>Jon slammed his\nhands on the desk now too, his face inches away from Sansa&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I am not making\nthe same mistakes!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;I would never do anything to put the North at\nrisk, to put Arya and Bran at risk, to put <i>you</i>\nat risk, Sansa! How many times do we have to have the same argument?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Until you convince me!&rdquo; </i>The shrillness\nof her own yelling surprised Sansa, it was a mark of how personal she was\ntaking the entire situation and she tried to regain some emotional distance.</p><p> &ldquo;Do you know how weak this makes us look? The\nKing in the North now a puppet because he doesn&rsquo;t think with his head!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa, that&rsquo;s <i>enough!&rdquo;</i> He took a beat. &ldquo;I would never&mdash;!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re too\nblinded that you don&rsquo;t even see it!&rdquo;</p><p>Swiftly, Sansa wrenched\nher eyes from Jon&rsquo;s gaze and turned her back to him, rubbing her forehead with\nher right hand. She was feverish, her skin was hot to the touch. </p><p>&ldquo;Too blinded to\nsee what?&rdquo; said Jon. </p><p>He waited for a\nresponse and when he didn&rsquo;t get one, something in him compelled him to shout. <i>&ldquo;What am I too blinded to see?&rdquo; </i></p><p>Sansa whirled around.\n&ldquo;That you have chosen her!&rdquo; she yelled. &ldquo;Over &mdash; over&mdash;&rdquo; <i>Me,</i> she screamed internally. <i>You\nchose an outsider over me! And I </i>hate<i>\nit and I don&rsquo;t know why I hate it </i>this<i>\nmuch!</i></p><p>Jon walked around\nthe desk to her, he touched her shoulder but she couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of\nhim holding her with the same hands he held <i>her</i>\nand she stepped out of his reach. While Jon itched to try again, he stayed\nwhere he was, giving her the space that she demanded, as he had and would\ncontinue to ensure that never again would she be touched unless she&rsquo;d wanted to\nbe.</p><p>She stared at him,\nbreathing heavily and he shook his head, doing his best to calm the rage within\nhim. He took a step toward her and stopped, maintaining a distance. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; he\npressed his lips together. &ldquo;I never knew you thought so little of me.&rdquo; </p><p>She rolled her\neyes. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m saying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he\ncountered. &ldquo;If you so &hellip; passionately believe that I would put everything and\neveryone at risk for something as crude as sex or as selfish as love then I &mdash;&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;So you <i>do</i> love her,&rdquo; she said severely, her\neyes flashing. </p><p>He looked at her\nwearily. &ldquo;Look, I loved a woman once,&rdquo; he said. \n&ldquo;A Wildling woman, her name was Ygritte and even my love for her couldn&rsquo;t\ncome before my duty to the Night&rsquo;s Watch, what makes you think anything can\ncome before my duty to &mdash;&rdquo; <i>You.</i> &ldquo;My people?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;You love her,&rdquo;\nshe repeated.</p><p>Jon gritted his\nteeth, opening and closing his fists. &ldquo;Why do you keep <i>saying </i>that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you\ndeny it?&rdquo; she retorted.</p><p>He looked at her,\nhis mouth agape, as something &mdash; a new emotion &mdash; tickled his chest. Something\nthat felt a bit like hope or a bit like delight. </p><p>&ldquo;The possibility\nbothers you that much?&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe no more\nthan how much seeing me dance with Lord Cerwyn bothered you,&rdquo; she said harshly.\n</p><p>Sansa didn&rsquo;t know\nwhat she was saying before she&rsquo;d said it and almost said something to take it\nback but when she saw the way Jon&rsquo;s face darkened, she realized this was the\nreaction she wanted from him. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you saying it&rsquo;s\nthe same thing?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Which is what\nexactly? Love or camaraderie?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being <i>impossible,</i> Sansa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Either way, it\nprobably isn&rsquo;t the same, Jon.&rdquo; Her words were spilling out of her. &ldquo;Considering\nthat I would never put him before you and you love your silver-haired queened\nmore than&mdash;-&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;Than <i>what?&rdquo;</i>\nhe said, his anger returning. &ldquo;More than what, Sansa, I want to hear you say\nit.&rdquo; He touched her wrist and when she didn&rsquo;t move away this time, he took both\nof her hands in his, her nails digging into his skin. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to hear\nyou say your cruelest insult to me!&rdquo; he said, leaning into her face. </p><p>She jutted hers\ninto his. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t an insult if it&rsquo;s the truth!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;You believing something so stubbornly doesn&rsquo;t\nmake it true!&rdquo; he said, holding onto her tighter. &ldquo;I would <i>never</i> betray you.&rdquo; He looked at her with an earnestness so fierce\nit made her legs weak. &ldquo;I would never &mdash; I would <i>never</i> put anyone else above you! I would never see you in danger <i>ever </i>again. I would never&hellip; I would never\n&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Neither of them\nknew who moved forward first only that they&rsquo;d come together in a breathless\nembrace that ignited a spark within both of them. Jon&rsquo;s hands no longer held\nSansa&rsquo;s, instead they held either side of her face while Sansa&rsquo;s hands gripped\nhis wrists, her body bowed toward him. </p><p>It was a kiss as\ncontradictory as everything before it; the softness of Jon&rsquo;s lips, the feel of\nthem on her own unwound Sansa as release surged through her &mdash; the taste of\nher tongue, the way her hands clenched his own filled Jon with an unparalleled\nrelish but these emotions also triggered others, triggered questions they could\nfeel rise within them, triggered more agitation, more &hellip; passion &mdash; it did\nnothing to satiate. </p><p>Finally, they\nparted and Sansa sank toward the desk as Jon walked swiftly over to a wall so\nhe could sag his weight against something solid. Now that they were apart, they\ncould breathe again and they each took in the air with a gluttonous enthusiasm,\ntrying to calm their thundering hearts, dry their teary eyes, still their\nracing minds. They dared not look at each other because now that they were\napart, they could feel the pull between them; within each of them was an urge\nto snap back together, an urge so intense it was like a humming on their skin. </p><p>And afraid of what\nwould happen if they stayed in the same place, afraid at his own longing to\nfind out, to go to her, Jon hastily left the room without looking back to see\nSansa gripping the desk with one hand and clutching her chest with the other.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I agree. I have a pretty visceral reaction to the idea of Jon fathering a bastard for all the reasons I\u2019ve detailed in other posts. I think on a purely narrative level, I get why people would think it could happen because it seems that this story sometimes insists in forcing their characters to live through their worst nightmares but at this point Jon has been hit with so many nightmares that I think there\u2019s really no point in twisting the knife even further (pun intended).\u00a0</p><p>The reason why I don\u2019t believe it will happen is because of D*ny\u2019s arc as\u00a0\u201cmother of dragons\u201d which would be at complete odds with her giving birth to a human baby. Also the exploration of what would happen to a half-Targ baby in a world where Targs are reviled has already been done with Jon and we will get the painful pay-off of that in season 8.\u00a0</p><p>So there are only a few reasons why this b0atie would come to pass:\u00a0</p><p>1.
