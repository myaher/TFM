I swear I tried not to listen while I drank my coffee but I was born being nosey and I\u2019ve learned to accept it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, it was my mom.\u201d Chris told me as he sat back down across from me with his eggs placed in front of him. \u201cShe told me that she wanted to come visit but I told her that it was pointless, especially that we only have two more weeks left of shooting.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah but\u00a0maybe she just might want to see you. Not the actual filming.\u201d I comment. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight before we began shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo about five months ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I remain silent, sipping my coffee and minding my own business.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking,\u00a0I know if it was my mother and I haven\u2019t seen her in five months and I told her she couldn\u2019t come to see me she, well let\u2019s just say she would not be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just let her come for a few days. I\u2019ll could go stay in a hotel or something so then you can have some quality Mommy-and-me time.\u201d I suggest to him doing a little shoulder dance.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe could come down for a weekend or something.\u201d Chris sits on this idea.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah. Go call her back and ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He reaches for his phone \u201cI\u2019ll go call her now. And if she does come you are not leaving.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris, it\u2019s no pr-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNope. Remember how your family basically forced me to stay here. Well I\u2019m going to do the same thing. Especially that\u2019s it your apartment.\u201d</p><p>My parents came to visit a few month ago with my best friend Charlie, and it\u2019s true. We kind of did forced him to stay but only because my parents were the ones who wanted to stay in a hotel. They wanted to use the points they\u2019ve earned from going on so many vacations and staying in so many hotels. Retirement at its finest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay first, we did not force you to do anything,\u201d A straight up lie \u201cand second, it\u2019s <i>our </i>apartment, I don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cExactly, your\u2019s and mine, you are not leaving your own apartment.\u201d I stuck my tongue out and blew a raspberry, giving in.</p><p>\u201cReal mature.\u201d He said, so of course I did it again. \u201cI\u2019m going to go call my mom alright?\u201d I gave him a thumbs up and motioned for him to actually make the call.</p><p>I was doing the dishes when he came into the kitchen with his pajamas which were a pair of grey sweatpants, loose black tee and messy bead hair. I <i>live</i> for images like this one. He\u2019s more of the \u2018all about comfort\u2019 pajama look while I look like I just walked through a 1950\u2019s sitcom with my polka dot matching pajama set with my hair in two braids.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all set, she\u2019s coming Friday night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat great. I\u2019m glad you get to spend some time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my brother is coming too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fun. Are you sure you don\u2019t want me to go? I promise you I don\u2019t mind one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, I told you, I want you to stay. I want you to get to know them.\u201d He tells me, he must\u2019ve noticed when I took a step back. \u201cMy family is very important to me, they know mostly everyone on set and my friends. They want to spend sometime with you anyway.\u201d He has his hands on my upper part of my arm and he\u2019s slightly crouching because of the slight height difference.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey want to spend time with <i>me</i>?\u201d I dramatically place my hand on my chest and try my best to crack a joke because I am dying inside. This is a lot of pressure, them wanting to spend time with me. That familiar knot begins forming in my stomach. How much has Chris told them about us? Probably every detail since the moment we met. Fuck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, they want to meet the weirdo who let a man she had only known for a week prior live with her. They want to ask her why.\u201d He turns to the sink and starts doing the dishes for me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would like to ask her why too.\u201d He chuckles lightly and begins scrubbing away. I couldn\u2019t help myself and just had to correct him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a week prior, like a solid month.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s still way too early to let a random man come live with you.\u201d He looks over his shoulder and I realize how close I was standing to him and slowly took a step back, giving personal space.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t random and this was supposed to be a two week thing at the most.\u201d Chris shrugs and shakes his head. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask a woman that you had only known a week prior to come live with her?\u201d Chris sucks his teeth and thinks about his answer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I was just surprised you agreed to it so quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I can be surprising in many ways.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Uh, okay.\u00a0</p><p>We had a \u2018travel day\u2019 which basically a day off where you are allowed to be lazy and slug like all day long. Chris and I spent the entire day on the couch together, watching an assortment of shows and movies. Since our declaration of focusing on being friends, we are all sorts of touchy today. Some are very subtle, like our arms brushing and then eventually resting next to each other. Others are a lot more noticeable, like throwing my legs over his or him laying his head in my lap. I do not mind one bit.\u00a0</p><p>Who knew laying on the couch all day would be so exhausting. I ended up drifting off on the couch, arms wrapped around a pillow and my feet in Chris\u2019s lap. I did hear Chris trying to wake me up but I was to lazy to actually open my eyes and get up. Next thing I know, I am being gently lifted off the couch, my arm wrapped around his neck and his securely wrapped around my waist, holding me up completely. He guided me to my room and laid me down, throwing the blanket over me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMm\u2019night bud\u201d I mumble.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*******</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ll pick you up&hellip;Ma no&hellip;Mom\u2026.Ma\u2026okay\u2026Ma\u2026okay\u2026see you in a bit.\u201d Chris hangs up the phone. He gives me an exhausted look.</p><p>\u201cWas that your mom?\u201d I ask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, actually it was a man who didn\u2019t speak English and asked how to say \u2018birth giver\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell him? I\u2019m dying\u00a0to know the answer.\u201d He shoots me another look. \u201cOkay then.\u201d I throw my hands up in defeat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just a bit nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s my mom, why are my palms sweaty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell technically its\u00a0 your \u2018ma\u2019 not \u2018mom\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Boston, can I help if my accent comes out sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re from Boston? What? You would think you tell me that at least three times a day, oh wait, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah this little thing right now,\u201d His hands draw circles in the space in between us\u00a0\u201cnot working for me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, I thought it might calm you down a bit.\u201d I tell him truthfully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for trying but it doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I can\u2019t help you there. I tend to talk a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You never talk. No, seriously I have to beg for you just to say a sentence.\u201d He states sarcastically. I pretend to look insulted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I was picking on you to make you laugh and less nervous. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d I tell him to make him feel guilty.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m kidding. Nothing really works, I just need to calm myself down.\u201d He finds a seat, not on the sofa, but on the arm of the sofa.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need me to do?\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, thanks though.\u201d He gives me a soft smile.</p><p>30 minutes pass before there\u2019s a knock on the door. I instantly stand up, my stomach turns into knots. Now I\u2019m nervous. Was Chris like this when he met my family? Poor guy. Chris races to get the door while I just stand there frozen like an idiot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi mom.\u201d Chris says to his mom before she basically jumps into his arms. Casually I make my way to the foyer to greet them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, yep. Please stand right in the middle of the door so others can\u2019t get in. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m carrying all the bags and it 100 degrees out.\u201d A voice appears behind the Mother and Son moment being played out. I\u2019m guessing the voice belongs to Chris\u2019s brother, Scott.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about you thrown the bags over them and I\u2019l catch them.\u201d I say, as a joke.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright. Go long!\u201d Scott says, pretending he\u2019s actually going to throw it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry. Hey Scott.\u201d Chris breaks his hug with his mom and she finds her way over to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Y/N, I\u2019m Lisa. Nice to finally meet you!\u201d She walks over to give me a hug which catches me off guard. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not a hugger, I freaking love hugs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too!\u201d I hug her back, she rubs my back a little in a very motherly way. She pulls away and stares at me, like trying to study me, still holding on to my arms.\u00a0 She grins from ear to ear. I can see where Chris gets his smile from.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Scott, Chris\u2019s brother.\u201d Scott tells me as I break away from Lisa\u2019s embrace and switch to his. His embrace is with one arm over my shoulders and I have to on my tippy toes to do the same to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m Y/N, Chris\u2019s, uh, roommate.\u201d I say, slightly laughing. Scott and Lisa both let out a small laugh. \u201cPlease come and sit, make yourself comfortable. Does anyone want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take some if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Scott tells me.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Mrs. Evans would you like anything? We also have tea?\u201d The nerves simply won\u2019t leave. I start to wipe my sweaty palms on my jeans.</p><p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s just Lisa, not Mrs. Evans. And I\u2019ll take some tea sweetheart.\u201d For some reason I ease a bit when she calls me \u2018sweetheart\u2019. I smile at her, she reciprocates.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChamomile okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, actually my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Chris, tea?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good, thank you.\u201d I nod and I go off to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo mom, how was your flight?\u201d I could hear Chris asks his mother. Getting the beverages ready, I notice Scott made his way to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d Scott offers. This family is damn polite.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I got it. Here\u2019s your coffee, I didn\u2019t know how you took it.\u201d I pass him creamer and sugar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoes your Mom like anything in her tea?\u201d I ask Scott.</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit of honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, great, thank you.\u201d\t</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I go to the cabinet and grab the honey.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018So how is it? Living with my brother. Pain in the ass right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, what a pain in my ass.\u201d I say, obviously joking around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. Not like I\u2019ve lived with him for 20 years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d We begin chuckling. \u201cJokes aside, it\u2019s actually been kinda fun having him around. He provides entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you guys get along. He talks a lot about you.\u201d Scott sips his coffee and takes in his environment. As much as I am curious on what Chris has said or how much he has said, I realize that its better if I don&rsquo;t travel down that rabbit hole.</p><p>\u201cSame can be said about you and your family.\u201d He smiles at this and nods slightly.\u00a0\u201cI better give this to your mom before it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>Walking into the living room, I notice Chris and his mom engrossed in a conversation, speaking a little over a whisper. I let out a small cough so they notice I&rsquo;m here.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d I nod and smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us sweetie, come.\u201d She pats the seat next to her. Not wanting to be rude, I sit next her. \u201cSo how is Chris as a roommate. Thank you, by the way, for giving him a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N told me that he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Scott intervenes. Chris raises his eyebrow at me in shock. Lisa just laughs in pure amusement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Chris inquires.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not.\u201d I reassure him. He nods in agreement. \u201cNot all the time, at least.\u201d I whisper to his mom, loud enough for Chris to hear.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Chris exclaims, laughing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cListen honey, he\u2019s always been a pain in the ass. It\u2019s just about getting used to it. After a couple of years you will hardly notice.\u201d She tells me, I begin to laugh with her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can&rsquo;t believe this.\u201d Chris locks eyes with me \u00a0lips curled into a smile, obviously enjoying this interaction.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, I gotta question. Does he sing to you before bed like he used to with me?\u201d Scott questions. My mouth falls open and I face Chris.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Scott!\u201d Chris yells, but continues his fit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d I shake my head in disbelief.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cScott, we don\u2019t need talk about that.\u201d Chris says, his mom is basically cackling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Scott turns to me and mouths\u00a0\u201cLater\u201d and winks.</p><p>We spent the rest of the night listening to different stories from their childhood. His mom is the sweetest person alive and his brother is just downright amazing. I was genuinely interested in their life experience and living in Massachusetts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo where are we sleeping?\u201d Lisa asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell I was going to take the sofa and maybe you guys can figure out who can take my room.\u201d I answered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the sofa, mom you can sleep in my room.\u201d Chris replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd where do I go?\u201d Scott wondered.</p><p>\u201cMy room.\u201d I responded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Scott asked and I was stumped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about I sleep on the sofa, mom sleeps in Chris\u2019s room and you too bunk up.\u201d Scott suggests and I nearly choke on my spit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr how about you and mom stay in my room, Y/N stays in her\u2019s and I take the sofa.\u201d Chris advocates. I like that plan much better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t sleep with other people, neither can mom. But I know you can. Also you won\u2019t even fit properly on the sofa.\u201d Scott advises. I wait for Lisa to say something along the lines of it morally wrong for a man and a woman to share a bed if they are unwed. But she must be a \u2018cool\u2019 mom because she looks like she agrees with Scott and waits for Chris\u2019s answer. Chris doesn\u2019t say anything but just looks at me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with whatever.\u201d Is all I can say. Let\u2019s be honest I\u2019m not really hating the idea but I have a feeling it\u2019s going to ruin the friends thing we have. Not like anything will happen. Of course not. It just might be weird. Chris stares at me, not fully believing that I\u2019m okay with it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way.\u201d Chris tells, mostly to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine with it, are you?\u201d Chris looks at me, to his brother, back to me, then to his mother, back to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I, okay.\u201d</p><p>I am dreading but also weirdly excited.

I swear I tried not to listen while I drank my coffee but I was born being nosey and I\u2019ve learned to accept it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, it was my mom.\u201d Chris told me as he sat back down across from me with his eggs placed in front of him. \u201cShe told me that she wanted to come visit but I told her that it was pointless, especially that we only have two more weeks left of shooting.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah but\u00a0maybe she just might want to see you. Not the actual filming.\u201d I comment. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight before we began shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo about five months ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I remain silent, sipping my coffee and minding my own business.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking,\u00a0I know if it was my mother and I haven\u2019t seen her in five months and I told her she couldn\u2019t come to see me she, well let\u2019s just say she would not be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just let her come for a few days. I\u2019ll could go stay in a hotel or something so then you can have some quality Mommy-and-me time.\u201d I suggest to him doing a little shoulder dance.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe could come down for a weekend or something.\u201d Chris sits on this idea.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah. Go call her back and ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He reaches for his phone \u201cI\u2019ll go call her now. And if she does come you are not leaving.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris, it\u2019s no pr-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNope. Remember how your family basically forced me to stay here. Well I\u2019m going to do the same thing. Especially that\u2019s it your apartment.\u201d</p><p>My parents came to visit a few month ago with my best friend Charlie, and it\u2019s true. We kind of did forced him to stay but only because my parents were the ones who wanted to stay in a hotel. They wanted to use the points they\u2019ve earned from going on so many vacations and staying in so many hotels. Retirement at its finest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay first, we did not force you to do anything,\u201d A straight up lie \u201cand second, it\u2019s <i>our </i>apartment, I don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cExactly, your\u2019s and mine, you are not leaving your own apartment.\u201d I stuck my tongue out and blew a raspberry, giving in.</p><p>\u201cReal mature.\u201d He said, so of course I did it again. \u201cI\u2019m going to go call my mom alright?\u201d I gave him a thumbs up and motioned for him to actually make the call.</p><p>I was doing the dishes when he came into the kitchen with his pajamas which were a pair of grey sweatpants, loose black tee and messy bead hair. I <i>live</i> for images like this one. He\u2019s more of the \u2018all about comfort\u2019 pajama look while I look like I just walked through a 1950\u2019s sitcom with my polka dot matching pajama set with my hair in two braids.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all set, she\u2019s coming Friday night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat great. I\u2019m glad you get to spend some time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my brother is coming too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fun. Are you sure you don\u2019t want me to go? I promise you I don\u2019t mind one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, I told you, I want you to stay. I want you to get to know them.\u201d He tells me, he must\u2019ve noticed when I took a step back. \u201cMy family is very important to me, they know mostly everyone on set and my friends. They want to spend sometime with you anyway.\u201d He has his hands on my upper part of my arm and he\u2019s slightly crouching because of the slight height difference.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey want to spend time with <i>me</i>?\u201d I dramatically place my hand on my chest and try my best to crack a joke because I am dying inside. This is a lot of pressure, them wanting to spend time with me. That familiar knot begins forming in my stomach. How much has Chris told them about us? Probably every detail since the moment we met. Fuck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, they want to meet the weirdo who let a man she had only known for a week prior live with her. They want to ask her why.\u201d He turns to the sink and starts doing the dishes for me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would like to ask her why too.\u201d He chuckles lightly and begins scrubbing away. I couldn\u2019t help myself and just had to correct him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a week prior, like a solid month.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s still way too early to let a random man come live with you.\u201d He looks over his shoulder and I realize how close I was standing to him and slowly took a step back, giving personal space.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t random and this was supposed to be a two week thing at the most.\u201d Chris shrugs and shakes his head. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask a woman that you had only known a week prior to come live with her?\u201d Chris sucks his teeth and thinks about his answer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I was just surprised you agreed to it so quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I can be surprising in many ways.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Uh, okay.\u00a0</p><p>We had a \u2018travel day\u2019 which basically a day off where you are allowed to be lazy and slug like all day long. Chris and I spent the entire day on the couch together, watching an assortment of shows and movies. Since our declaration of focusing on being friends, we are all sorts of touchy today. Some are very subtle, like our arms brushing and then eventually resting next to each other. Others are a lot more noticeable, like throwing my legs over his or him laying his head in my lap. I do not mind one bit.\u00a0</p><p>Who knew laying on the couch all day would be so exhausting. I ended up drifting off on the couch, arms wrapped around a pillow and my feet in Chris\u2019s lap. I did hear Chris trying to wake me up but I was to lazy to actually open my eyes and get up. Next thing I know, I am being gently lifted off the couch, my arm wrapped around his neck and his securely wrapped around my waist, holding me up completely. He guided me to my room and laid me down, throwing the blanket over me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMm\u2019night bud\u201d I mumble.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*******</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ll pick you up\u2026Ma no\u2026Mom\u2026.Ma\u2026okay\u2026Ma\u2026okay\u2026see you in a bit.\u201d Chris hangs up the phone. He gives me an exhausted look.</p><p>\u201cWas that your mom?\u201d I ask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, actually it was a man who didn\u2019t speak English and asked how to say \u2018birth giver\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell him? I\u2019m dying\u00a0to know the answer.\u201d He shoots me another look. \u201cOkay then.\u201d I throw my hands up in defeat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just a bit nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s my mom, why are my palms sweaty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell technically its\u00a0 your \u2018ma\u2019 not \u2018mom\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Boston, can I help if my accent comes out sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re from Boston? What? You would think you tell me that at least three times a day, oh wait, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah this little thing right now,\u201d His hands draw circles in the space in between us\u00a0\u201cnot working for me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, I thought it might calm you down a bit.\u201d I tell him truthfully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for trying but it doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I can\u2019t help you there. I tend to talk a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You never talk. No, seriously I have to beg for you just to say a sentence.\u201d He states sarcastically. I pretend to look insulted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I was picking on you to make you laugh and less nervous. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d I tell him to make him feel guilty.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m kidding. Nothing really works, I just need to calm myself down.\u201d He finds a seat, not on the sofa, but on the arm of the sofa.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need me to do?\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, thanks though.\u201d He gives me a soft smile.</p><p>30 minutes pass before there\u2019s a knock on the door. I instantly stand up, my stomach turns into knots. Now I\u2019m nervous. Was Chris like this when he met my family? Poor guy. Chris races to get the door while I just stand there frozen like an idiot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi mom.\u201d Chris says to his mom before she basically jumps into his arms. Casually I make my way to the foyer to greet them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, yep. Please stand right in the middle of the door so others can\u2019t get in. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m carrying all the bags and it 100 degrees out.\u201d A voice appears behind the Mother and Son moment being played out. I\u2019m guessing the voice belongs to Chris\u2019s brother, Scott.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about you thrown the bags over them and I\u2019l catch them.\u201d I say, as a joke.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright. Go long!\u201d Scott says, pretending he\u2019s actually going to throw it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry. Hey Scott.\u201d Chris breaks his hug with his mom and she finds her way over to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Y/N, I\u2019m Lisa. Nice to finally meet you!\u201d She walks over to give me a hug which catches me off guard. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not a hugger, I freaking love hugs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too!\u201d I hug her back, she rubs my back a little in a very motherly way. She pulls away and stares at me, like trying to study me, still holding on to my arms.\u00a0 She grins from ear to ear. I can see where Chris gets his smile from.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Scott, Chris\u2019s brother.\u201d Scott tells me as I break away from Lisa\u2019s embrace and switch to his. His embrace is with one arm over my shoulders and I have to on my tippy toes to do the same to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m Y/N, Chris\u2019s, uh, roommate.\u201d I say, slightly laughing. Scott and Lisa both let out a small laugh. \u201cPlease come and sit, make yourself comfortable. Does anyone want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take some if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Scott tells me.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Mrs. Evans would you like anything? We also have tea?\u201d The nerves simply won\u2019t leave. I start to wipe my sweaty palms on my jeans.</p><p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s just Lisa, not Mrs. Evans. And I\u2019ll take some tea sweetheart.\u201d For some reason I ease a bit when she calls me \u2018sweetheart\u2019. I smile at her, she reciprocates.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChamomile okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, actually my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Chris, tea?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good, thank you.\u201d I nod and I go off to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo mom, how was your flight?\u201d I could hear Chris asks his mother. Getting the beverages ready, I notice Scott made his way to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d Scott offers. This family is damn polite.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I got it. Here\u2019s your coffee, I didn\u2019t know how you took it.\u201d I pass him creamer and sugar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoes your Mom like anything in her tea?\u201d I ask Scott.</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit of honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, great, thank you.\u201d\t</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I go to the cabinet and grab the honey.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018So how is it? Living with my brother. Pain in the ass right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, what a pain in my ass.\u201d I say, obviously joking around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. Not like I\u2019ve lived with him for 20 years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d We begin chuckling. \u201cJokes aside, it\u2019s actually been kinda fun having him around. He provides entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you guys get along. He talks a lot about you.\u201d Scott sips his coffee and takes in his environment. As much as I am curious on what Chris has said or how much he has said, I realize that its better if I don\u2019t travel down that rabbit hole.</p><p>\u201cSame can be said about you and your family.\u201d He smiles at this and nods slightly.\u00a0\u201cI better give this to your mom before it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>Walking into the living room, I notice Chris and his mom engrossed in a conversation, speaking a little over a whisper. I let out a small cough so they notice I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d I nod and smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us sweetie, come.\u201d She pats the seat next to her. Not wanting to be rude, I sit next her. \u201cSo how is Chris as a roommate. Thank you, by the way, for giving him a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N told me that he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Scott intervenes. Chris raises his eyebrow at me in shock. Lisa just laughs in pure amusement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Chris inquires.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not.\u201d I reassure him. He nods in agreement. \u201cNot all the time, at least.\u201d I whisper to his mom, loud enough for Chris to hear.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Chris exclaims, laughing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cListen honey, he\u2019s always been a pain in the ass. It\u2019s just about getting used to it. After a couple of years you will hardly notice.\u201d She tells me, I begin to laugh with her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d Chris locks eyes with me \u00a0lips curled into a smile, obviously enjoying this interaction.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, I gotta question. Does he sing to you before bed like he used to with me?\u201d Scott questions. My mouth falls open and I face Chris.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Scott!\u201d Chris yells, but continues his fit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d I shake my head in disbelief.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cScott, we don\u2019t need talk about that.\u201d Chris says, his mom is basically cackling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Scott turns to me and mouths\u00a0\u201cLater\u201d and winks.</p><p>We spent the rest of the night listening to different stories from their childhood. His mom is the sweetest person alive and his brother is just downright amazing. I was genuinely interested in their life experience and living in Massachusetts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo where are we sleeping?\u201d Lisa asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell I was going to take the sofa and maybe you guys can figure out who can take my room.\u201d I answered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the sofa, mom you can sleep in my room.\u201d Chris replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd where do I go?\u201d Scott wondered.</p><p>\u201cMy room.\u201d I responded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Scott asked and I was stumped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about I sleep on the sofa, mom sleeps in Chris\u2019s room and you too bunk up.\u201d Scott suggests and I nearly choke on my spit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr how about you and mom stay in my room, Y/N stays in her\u2019s and I take the sofa.\u201d Chris advocates. I like that plan much better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t sleep with other people, neither can mom. But I know you can. Also you won\u2019t even fit properly on the sofa.\u201d Scott advises. I wait for Lisa to say something along the lines of it morally wrong for a man and a woman to share a bed if they are unwed. But she must be a \u2018cool\u2019 mom because she looks like she agrees with Scott and waits for Chris\u2019s answer. Chris doesn\u2019t say anything but just looks at me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with whatever.\u201d Is all I can say. Let\u2019s be honest I\u2019m not really hating the idea but I have a feeling it\u2019s going to ruin the friends thing we have. Not like anything will happen. Of course not. It just might be weird. Chris stares at me, not fully believing that I\u2019m okay with it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way.\u201d Chris tells, mostly to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine with it, are you?\u201d Chris looks at me, to his brother, back to me, then to his mother, back to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I, okay.\u201d</p><p>I am dreading but also weirdly excited. Lord help me.\u00a0</p><p><i><b>taglist:</b></i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjSytOf70Vuk-IW_uSRR7rA\">@vnderoos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Lq8j5SC-VVyav6ZiWYuNA\">@h4ppydancing</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXJZ8rlTf4E6G1iq9c1kGrQ\">@tonightsnogoodhowaboutwednesday</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRHnvlvZkGhP-HOw1fGxkw\">@icantbeliveitsnotbutter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/motxK41zKJMb2XJq3dvmWPA\">@thatoneperson5000</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4m8qVtCow2PkgWp7Jr4WGQ\">@pbnjparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\">@lokilvrr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQhEywaJmfv6muDk8DFzg\">@jaiboomer11</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbaRq-ZK4D5vJRLKrIS75ZA\">@lokiloveheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mODJfoXg1PUrlZxKZELGtlA\">@fanfictionjunkie1112</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_yKt_loZCWj6B_XFHI8QoQ\">@achishisha</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8v_V2SwZwHdkAAaHmHd3zw\">@effielumiere</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpo3u_agz5EDs8FI_O8feKQ\">@deepfrz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5vtewUhYqnYONXGwEodNkw\">@smileygirl08</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZEyrzwCRV0BauE7O00jmyQ\">@everything-is-awesomesauce</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6VQvLeEQXdfSRKU_xv81vQ\">@whitewitchdown</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRi3VskABqbEWy2Qc7OV5qA\">@myles-production</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miPx7qe1krblF2km5nqCazQ\">@winnielinleigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6PEwL_CwZBjUE9fELv2c6g\">@shawn-mendes-thirst</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgtK9BR0P09-yUWy1Mw3lNg\">@cap-just-said-language</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbX4sWNuBUXVcwsjALyT0uw\">@thegetawaywriter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msMK1ZjbOszUr5_kzwlQzMg\">@saccmaass</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/my2w9tiuyOt0XW4opZDBjoQ\">@odinson-barnes</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCi5-2ZBKegudIbCHPQ9m3A\">@aestheticallykelsey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msmAdAKERFWuI36t5nMR3ag\">@troublermalik</a> @strongpoweful-alive <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mavcs5ip6lav-ydCiRLr5cA\">@buckybarneshairpullingkink</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> </p></p>",

I swear I tried not to listen while I drank my coffee but I was born being nosey and I\u2019ve learned to accept it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, it was my mom.\u201d Chris told me as he sat back down across from me with his eggs placed in front of him. \u201cShe told me that she wanted to come visit but I told her that it was pointless, especially that we only have two more weeks left of shooting.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah but\u00a0maybe she just might want to see you. Not the actual filming.\u201d I comment. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight before we began shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo about five months ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I remain silent, sipping my coffee and minding my own business.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking,\u00a0I know if it was my mother and I haven\u2019t seen her in five months and I told her she couldn\u2019t come to see me she, well let\u2019s just say she would not be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just let her come for a few days. I\u2019ll could go stay in a hotel or something so then you can have some quality Mommy-and-me time.\u201d I suggest to him doing a little shoulder dance.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe could come down for a weekend or something.\u201d Chris sits on this idea.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah. Go call her back and ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He reaches for his phone \u201cI\u2019ll go call her now. And if she does come you are not leaving.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris, it\u2019s no pr-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNope. Remember how your family basically forced me to stay here. Well I\u2019m going to do the same thing. Especially that\u2019s it your apartment.\u201d</p><p>My parents came to visit a few month ago with my best friend Charlie, and it\u2019s true. We kind of did forced him to stay but only because my parents were the ones who wanted to stay in a hotel. They wanted to use the points they\u2019ve earned from going on so many vacations and staying in so many hotels. Retirement at its finest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay first, we did not force you to do anything,\u201d A straight up lie \u201cand second, it\u2019s <i>our </i>apartment, I don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cExactly, your\u2019s and mine, you are not leaving your own apartment.\u201d I stuck my tongue out and blew a raspberry, giving in.</p><p>\u201cReal mature.\u201d He said, so of course I did it again. \u201cI\u2019m going to go call my mom alright?\u201d I gave him a thumbs up and motioned for him to actually make the call.</p><p>I was doing the dishes when he came into the kitchen with his pajamas which were a pair of grey sweatpants, loose black tee and messy bead hair. I <i>live</i> for images like this one. He\u2019s more of the \u2018all about comfort\u2019 pajama look while I look like I just walked through a 1950\u2019s sitcom with my polka dot matching pajama set with my hair in two braids.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all set, she\u2019s coming Friday night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat great. I\u2019m glad you get to spend some time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my brother is coming too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fun. Are you sure you don\u2019t want me to go? I promise you I don\u2019t mind one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, I told you, I want you to stay. I want you to get to know them.\u201d He tells me, he must\u2019ve noticed when I took a step back. \u201cMy family is very important to me, they know mostly everyone on set and my friends. They want to spend sometime with you anyway.\u201d He has his hands on my upper part of my arm and he\u2019s slightly crouching because of the slight height difference.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey want to spend time with <i>me</i>?\u201d I dramatically place my hand on my chest and try my best to crack a joke because I am dying inside. This is a lot of pressure, them wanting to spend time with me. That familiar knot begins forming in my stomach. How much has Chris told them about us? Probably every detail since the moment we met. Fuck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, they want to meet the weirdo who let a man she had only known for a week prior live with her. They want to ask her why.\u201d He turns to the sink and starts doing the dishes for me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI would like to ask her why too.\u201d He chuckles lightly and begins scrubbing away. I couldn\u2019t help myself and just had to correct him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a week prior, like a solid month.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s still way too early to let a random man come live with you.\u201d He looks over his shoulder and I realize how close I was standing to him and slowly took a step back, giving personal space.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t random and this was supposed to be a two week thing at the most.\u201d Chris shrugs and shakes his head. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask a woman that you had only known a week prior to come live with her?\u201d Chris sucks his teeth and thinks about his answer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I was just surprised you agreed to it so quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I can be surprising in many ways.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Uh, okay.\u00a0</p><p>We had a \u2018travel day\u2019 which basically a day off where you are allowed to be lazy and slug like all day long. Chris and I spent the entire day on the couch together, watching an assortment of shows and movies. Since our declaration of focusing on being friends, we are all sorts of touchy today. Some are very subtle, like our arms brushing and then eventually resting next to each other. Others are a lot more noticeable, like throwing my legs over his or him laying his head in my lap. I do not mind one bit.\u00a0</p><p>Who knew laying on the couch all day would be so exhausting. I ended up drifting off on the couch, arms wrapped around a pillow and my feet in Chris\u2019s lap. I did hear Chris trying to wake me up but I was to lazy to actually open my eyes and get up. Next thing I know, I am being gently lifted off the couch, my arm wrapped around his neck and his securely wrapped around my waist, holding me up completely. He guided me to my room and laid me down, throwing the blanket over me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMm\u2019night bud\u201d I mumble.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*******</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ll pick you up\u2026Ma no\u2026Mom\u2026.Ma\u2026okay\u2026Ma\u2026okay\u2026see you in a bit.\u201d Chris hangs up the phone. He gives me an exhausted look.</p><p>\u201cWas that your mom?\u201d I ask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, actually it was a man who didn\u2019t speak English and asked how to say \u2018birth giver\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell him? I\u2019m dying\u00a0to know the answer.\u201d He shoots me another look. \u201cOkay then.\u201d I throw my hands up in defeat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just a bit nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s my mom, why are my palms sweaty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell technically its\u00a0 your \u2018ma\u2019 not \u2018mom\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Boston, can I help if my accent comes out sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re from Boston? What? You would think you tell me that at least three times a day, oh wait, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah this little thing right now,\u201d His hands draw circles in the space in between us\u00a0\u201cnot working for me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, I thought it might calm you down a bit.\u201d I tell him truthfully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for trying but it doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I can\u2019t help you there. I tend to talk a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You never talk. No, seriously I have to beg for you just to say a sentence.\u201d He states sarcastically. I pretend to look insulted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I was picking on you to make you laugh and less nervous. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d I tell him to make him feel guilty.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m kidding. Nothing really works, I just need to calm myself down.\u201d He finds a seat, not on the sofa, but on the arm of the sofa.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need me to do?\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, thanks though.\u201d He gives me a soft smile.</p><p>30 minutes pass before there\u2019s a knock on the door. I instantly stand up, my stomach turns into knots. Now I\u2019m nervous. Was Chris like this when he met my family? Poor guy. Chris races to get the door while I just stand there frozen like an idiot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi mom.\u201d Chris says to his mom before she basically jumps into his arms. Casually I make my way to the foyer to greet them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, yep. Please stand right in the middle of the door so others can\u2019t get in. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m carrying all the bags and it 100 degrees out.\u201d A voice appears behind the Mother and Son moment being played out. I\u2019m guessing the voice belongs to Chris\u2019s brother, Scott.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about you thrown the bags over them and I\u2019l catch them.\u201d I say, as a joke.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright. Go long!\u201d Scott says, pretending he\u2019s actually going to throw it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry. Hey Scott.\u201d Chris breaks his hug with his mom and she finds her way over to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Y/N, I\u2019m Lisa. Nice to finally meet you!\u201d She walks over to give me a hug which catches me off guard. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not a hugger, I freaking love hugs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too!\u201d I hug her back, she rubs my back a little in a very motherly way. She pulls away and stares at me, like trying to study me, still holding on to my arms.\u00a0 She grins from ear to ear. I can see where Chris gets his smile from.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Scott, Chris\u2019s brother.\u201d Scott tells me as I break away from Lisa\u2019s embrace and switch to his. His embrace is with one arm over my shoulders and I have to on my tippy toes to do the same to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m Y/N, Chris\u2019s, uh, roommate.\u201d I say, slightly laughing. Scott and Lisa both let out a small laugh. \u201cPlease come and sit, make yourself comfortable. Does anyone want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take some if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Scott tells me.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Mrs. Evans would you like anything? We also have tea?\u201d The nerves simply won\u2019t leave. I start to wipe my sweaty palms on my jeans.</p><p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s just Lisa, not Mrs. Evans. And I\u2019ll take some tea sweetheart.\u201d For some reason I ease a bit when she calls me \u2018sweetheart\u2019. I smile at her, she reciprocates.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChamomile okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, actually my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Chris, tea?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good, thank you.\u201d I nod and I go off to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo mom, how was your flight?\u201d I could hear Chris asks his mother. Getting the beverages ready, I notice Scott made his way to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d Scott offers. This family is damn polite.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I got it. Here\u2019s your coffee, I didn\u2019t know how you took it.\u201d I pass him creamer and sugar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoes your Mom like anything in her tea?\u201d I ask Scott.</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit of honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, great, thank you.\u201d\t</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I go to the cabinet and grab the honey.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018So how is it? Living with my brother. Pain in the ass right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh, what a pain in my ass.\u201d I say, obviously joking around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. Not like I\u2019ve lived with him for 20 years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d We begin chuckling. \u201cJokes aside, it\u2019s actually been kinda fun having him around. He provides entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you guys get along. He talks a lot about you.\u201d Scott sips his coffee and takes in his environment. As much as I am curious on what Chris has said or how much he has said, I realize that its better if I don\u2019t travel down that rabbit hole.</p><p>\u201cSame can be said about you and your family.\u201d He smiles at this and nods slightly.\u00a0\u201cI better give this to your mom before it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>Walking into the living room, I notice Chris and his mom engrossed in a conversation, speaking a little over a whisper. I let out a small cough so they notice I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d I nod and smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us sweetie, come.\u201d She pats the seat next to her. Not wanting to be rude, I sit next her. \u201cSo how is Chris as a roommate. Thank you, by the way, for giving him a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N told me that he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Scott intervenes. Chris raises his eyebrow at me in shock. Lisa just laughs in pure amusement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Chris inquires.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not.\u201d I reassure him. He nods in agreement. \u201cNot all the time, at least.\u201d I whisper to his mom, loud enough for Chris to hear.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Chris exclaims, laughing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cListen honey, he\u2019s always been a pain in the ass. It\u2019s just about getting used to it. After a couple of years you will hardly notice.\u201d She tells me, I begin to laugh with her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d Chris locks eyes with me \u00a0lips curled into a smile, obviously enjoying this interaction.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, I gotta question. Does he sing to you before bed like he used to with me?\u201d Scott questions. My mouth falls open and I face Chris.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Scott!\u201d Chris yells, but continues his fit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d I shake my head in disbelief.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cScott, we don\u2019t need talk about that.\u201d Chris says, his mom is basically cackling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Scott turns to me and mouths\u00a0\u201cLater\u201d and winks.</p><p>We spent the rest of the night listening to different stories from their childhood. His mom is the sweetest person alive and his brother is just downright amazing. I was genuinely interested in their life experience and living in Massachusetts.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo where are we sleeping?\u201d Lisa asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell I was going to take the sofa and maybe you guys can figure out who can take my room.\u201d I answered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the sofa, mom you can sleep in my room.\u201d Chris replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd where do I go?\u201d Scott wondered.</p><p>\u201cMy room.\u201d I responded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Scott asked and I was stumped.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about I sleep on the sofa, mom sleeps in Chris\u2019s room and you too bunk up.\u201d Scott suggests and I nearly choke on my spit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr how about you and mom stay in my room, Y/N stays in her\u2019s and I take the sofa.\u201d Chris advocates. I like that plan much better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t sleep with other people, neither can mom. But I know you can. Also you won\u2019t even fit properly on the sofa.\u201d Scott advises. I wait for Lisa to say something along the lines of it morally wrong for a man and a woman to share a bed if they are unwed. But she must be a \u2018cool\u2019 mom because she looks like she agrees with Scott and waits for Chris\u2019s answer. Chris doesn\u2019t say anything but just looks at me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with whatever.\u201d Is all I can say. Let\u2019s be honest I\u2019m not really hating the idea but I have a feeling it\u2019s going to ruin the friends thing we have. Not like anything will happen. Of course not. It just might be weird. Chris stares at me, not fully believing that I\u2019m okay with it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way.\u201d Chris tells, mostly to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine with it, are you?\u201d Chris looks at me, to his brother, back to me, then to his mother, back to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I, okay.\u201d</p><p>I am dreading but also weirdly excited. Lord help me.\u00a0</p><p><i><b>taglist:</b></i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjSytOf70Vuk-IW_uSRR7rA\">@vnderoos</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Lq8j5SC-VVyav6ZiWYuNA\">@h4ppydancing</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXJZ8rlTf4E6G1iq9c1kGrQ\">@tonightsnogoodhowaboutwednesday</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRHnvlvZkGhP-HOw1fGxkw\">@icantbeliveitsnotbutter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/motxK41zKJMb2XJq3dvmWPA\">@thatoneperson5000</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4m8qVtCow2PkgWp7Jr4WGQ\">@pbnjparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\">@lokilvrr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQhEywaJmfv6muDk8DFzg\">@jaiboomer11</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbaRq-ZK4D5vJRLKrIS75ZA\">@lokiloveheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mODJfoXg1PUrlZxKZELGtlA\">@fanfictionjunkie1112</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_yKt_loZCWj6B_XFHI8QoQ\">@achishisha</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8v_V2SwZwHdkAAaHmHd3zw\">@effielumiere</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpo3u_agz5EDs8FI_O8feKQ\">@deepfrz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5vtewUhYqnYONXGwEodNkw\">@smileygirl08</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZEyrzwCRV0BauE7O00jmyQ\">@everything-is-awesomesauce</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6VQvLeEQXdfSRKU_xv81vQ\">@whitewitchdown</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRi3VskABqbEWy2Qc7OV5qA\">@myles-production</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miPx7qe1krblF2km5nqCazQ\">@winnielinleigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6PEwL_CwZBjUE9fELv2c6g\">@shawn-mendes-thirst</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgtK9BR0P09-yUWy1Mw3lNg\">@cap-just-said-language</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbX4sWNuBUXVcwsjALyT0uw\">@thegetawaywriter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msMK1ZjbOszUr5_kzwlQzMg\">@saccmaass</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/my2w9tiuyOt0XW4opZDBjoQ\">@odinson-barnes</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCi5-2ZBKegudIbCHPQ9m3A\">@aestheticallykelsey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msmAdAKERFWuI36t5nMR3ag\">@troublermalik</a> @strongpoweful-alive <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mavcs5ip6lav-ydCiRLr5cA\">@buckybarneshairpullingkink</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> </p></p>",

I swear I tried not to listen while I drank my coffee but I was born being nosey and I&rsquo;ve learned to accept it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, it was my mom.&rdquo; Chris told me as he sat back down across from me with his eggs placed in front of him. &ldquo;She told me that she wanted to come visit but I told her that it was pointless, especially that we only have two more weeks left of shooting.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but&nbsp;maybe she just might want to see you. Not the actual filming.&rdquo; I comment. &ldquo;When was the last time you saw her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right before we began shooting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So about five months ago?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>I remain silent, sipping my coffee and minding my own business.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just thinking,&nbsp;I know if it was my mother and I haven&rsquo;t seen her in five months and I told her she couldn&rsquo;t come to see me she, well let&rsquo;s just say she would not be happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just let her come for a few days. I&rsquo;ll could go stay in a hotel or something so then you can have some quality Mommy-and-me time.&rdquo; I suggest to him doing a little shoulder dance.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She could come down for a weekend or something.&rdquo; Chris sits on this idea.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Go call her back and ask her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; He reaches for his phone &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go call her now. And if she does come you are not leaving.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, it&rsquo;s no pr-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. Remember how your family basically forced me to stay here. Well I&rsquo;m going to do the same thing. Especially that&rsquo;s it your apartment.&rdquo;</p><p>My parents came to visit a few month ago with my best friend Charlie, and it&rsquo;s true. We kind of did forced him to stay but only because my parents were the ones who wanted to stay in a hotel. They wanted to use the points they&rsquo;ve earned from going on so many vacations and staying in so many hotels. Retirement at its finest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay first, we did not force you to do anything,&rdquo; A straight up lie &ldquo;and second, it&rsquo;s <i>our </i>apartment, I don&rsquo;t know how many times I have to tell you that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly, your&rsquo;s and mine, you are not leaving your own apartment.&rdquo; I stuck my tongue out and blew a raspberry, giving in.</p><p>&ldquo;Real mature.&rdquo; He said, so of course I did it again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go call my mom alright?&rdquo; I gave him a thumbs up and motioned for him to actually make the call.</p><p>I was doing the dishes when he came into the kitchen with his pajamas which were a pair of grey sweatpants, loose black tee and messy bead hair. I <i>live</i> for images like this one. He&rsquo;s more of the &lsquo;all about comfort&rsquo; pajama look while I look like I just walked through a 1950&rsquo;s sitcom with my polka dot matching pajama set with my hair in two braids.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all set, she&rsquo;s coming Friday night.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That great. I&rsquo;m glad you get to spend some time with her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And my brother is coming too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scott, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be fun. Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to go? I promise you I don&rsquo;t mind one bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I told you, I want you to stay. I want you to get to know them.&rdquo; He tells me, he must&rsquo;ve noticed when I took a step back. &ldquo;My family is very important to me, they know mostly everyone on set and my friends. They want to spend sometime with you anyway.&rdquo; He has his hands on my upper part of my arm and he&rsquo;s slightly crouching because of the slight height difference.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They want to spend time with <i>me</i>?&rdquo; I dramatically place my hand on my chest and try my best to crack a joke because I am dying inside. This is a lot of pressure, them wanting to spend time with me. That familiar knot begins forming in my stomach. How much has Chris told them about us? Probably every detail since the moment we met. Fuck.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they want to meet the weirdo who let a man she had only known for a week prior live with her. They want to ask her why.&rdquo; He turns to the sink and starts doing the dishes for me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I would like to ask her why too.&rdquo; He chuckles lightly and begins scrubbing away. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself and just had to correct him. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a week prior, like a solid month.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s still way too early to let a random man come live with you.&rdquo; He looks over his shoulder and I realize how close I was standing to him and slowly took a step back, giving personal space.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t random and this was supposed to be a two week thing at the most.&rdquo; Chris shrugs and shakes his head. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you ask a woman that you had only known a week prior to come live with her?&rdquo; Chris sucks his teeth and thinks about his answer.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know. I was just surprised you agreed to it so quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I can be surprising in many ways.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Uh, okay.&nbsp;</p><p>We had a &lsquo;travel day&rsquo; which basically a day off where you are allowed to be lazy and slug like all day long. Chris and I spent the entire day on the couch together, watching an assortment of shows and movies. Since our declaration of focusing on being friends, we are all sorts of touchy today. Some are very subtle, like our arms brushing and then eventually resting next to each other. Others are a lot more noticeable, like throwing my legs over his or him laying his head in my lap. I do not mind one bit.&nbsp;</p><p>Who knew laying on the couch all day would be so exhausting. I ended up drifting off on the couch, arms wrapped around a pillow and my feet in Chris&rsquo;s lap. I did hear Chris trying to wake me up but I was to lazy to actually open my eyes and get up. Next thing I know, I am being gently lifted off the couch, my arm wrapped around his neck and his securely wrapped around my waist, holding me up completely. He guided me to my room and laid me down, throwing the blanket over me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm&rsquo;night bud&rdquo; I mumble.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>*******</p><p>&ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;ll pick you up&hellip;Ma no&hellip;Mom&hellip;.Ma&hellip;okay&hellip;Ma&hellip;okay&hellip;see you in a bit.&rdquo; Chris hangs up the phone. He gives me an exhausted look.</p><p>&ldquo;Was that your mom?&rdquo; I ask.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, actually it was a man who didn&rsquo;t speak English and asked how to say &lsquo;birth giver&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what did you tell him? I&rsquo;m dying&nbsp;to know the answer.&rdquo; He shoots me another look. &ldquo;Okay then.&rdquo; I throw my hands up in defeat.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m just a bit nervous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s my mom, why are my palms sweaty?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well technically its&nbsp; your &lsquo;ma&rsquo; not &lsquo;mom&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Boston, can I help if my accent comes out sometimes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, you&rsquo;re from Boston? What? You would think you tell me that at least three times a day, oh wait, you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah this little thing right now,&rdquo; His hands draw circles in the space in between us&nbsp;&ldquo;not working for me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I thought it might calm you down a bit.&rdquo; I tell him truthfully.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for trying but it doesn&rsquo;t work for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, silence?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I can&rsquo;t help you there. I tend to talk a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? You never talk. No, seriously I have to beg for you just to say a sentence.&rdquo; He states sarcastically. I pretend to look insulted.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I was picking on you to make you laugh and less nervous. What&rsquo;s your excuse?&rdquo; I tell him to make him feel guilty.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m kidding. Nothing really works, I just need to calm myself down.&rdquo; He finds a seat, not on the sofa, but on the arm of the sofa.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything you need me to do?&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, thanks though.&rdquo; He gives me a soft smile.</p><p>30 minutes pass before there&rsquo;s a knock on the door. I instantly stand up, my stomach turns into knots. Now I&rsquo;m nervous. Was Chris like this when he met my family? Poor guy. Chris races to get the door while I just stand there frozen like an idiot.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi mom.&rdquo; Chris says to his mom before she basically jumps into his arms. Casually I make my way to the foyer to greet them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, yep. Please stand right in the middle of the door so others can&rsquo;t get in. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m carrying all the bags and it 100 degrees out.&rdquo; A voice appears behind the Mother and Son moment being played out. I&rsquo;m guessing the voice belongs to Chris&rsquo;s brother, Scott.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How about you thrown the bags over them and I&rsquo;l catch them.&rdquo; I say, as a joke.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Go long!&rdquo; Scott says, pretending he&rsquo;s actually going to throw it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. Hey Scott.&rdquo; Chris breaks his hug with his mom and she finds her way over to me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And you must be Y/N, I&rsquo;m Lisa. Nice to finally meet you!&rdquo; She walks over to give me a hug which catches me off guard. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m not a hugger, I freaking love hugs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you too!&rdquo; I hug her back, she rubs my back a little in a very motherly way. She pulls away and stares at me, like trying to study me, still holding on to my arms.&nbsp; She grins from ear to ear. I can see where Chris gets his smile from.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Scott, Chris&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo; Scott tells me as I break away from Lisa&rsquo;s embrace and switch to his. His embrace is with one arm over my shoulders and I have to on my tippy toes to do the same to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m Y/N, Chris&rsquo;s, uh, roommate.&rdquo; I say, slightly laughing. Scott and Lisa both let out a small laugh. &ldquo;Please come and sit, make yourself comfortable. Does anyone want some coffee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take some if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; Scott tells me.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, Mrs. Evans would you like anything? We also have tea?&rdquo; The nerves simply won&rsquo;t leave. I start to wipe my sweaty palms on my jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, it&rsquo;s just Lisa, not Mrs. Evans. And I&rsquo;ll take some tea sweetheart.&rdquo; For some reason I ease a bit when she calls me &lsquo;sweetheart&rsquo;. I smile at her, she reciprocates.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chamomile okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfect, actually my favorite.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great. Chris, tea?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, I&rsquo;m good, thank you.&rdquo; I nod and I go off to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So mom, how was your flight?&rdquo; I could hear Chris asks his mother. Getting the beverages ready, I notice Scott made his way to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you with anything?&rdquo; Scott offers. This family is damn polite.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I think I got it. Here&rsquo;s your coffee, I didn&rsquo;t know how you took it.&rdquo; I pass him creamer and sugar.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Does your Mom like anything in her tea?&rdquo; I ask Scott.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a little bit of honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, great, thank you.&rdquo;\t</p><p>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; I go to the cabinet and grab the honey.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;So how is it? Living with my brother. Pain in the ass right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, what a pain in my ass.&rdquo; I say, obviously joking around.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine. Not like I&rsquo;ve lived with him for 20 years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea.&rdquo; We begin chuckling. &ldquo;Jokes aside, it&rsquo;s actually been kinda fun having him around. He provides entertainment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you guys get along. He talks a lot about you.&rdquo; Scott sips his coffee and takes in his environment. As much as I am curious on what Chris has said or how much he has said, I realize that its better if I don&rsquo;t travel down that rabbit hole.</p><p>&ldquo;Same can be said about you and your family.&rdquo; He smiles at this and nods slightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I better give this to your mom before it gets cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Walking into the living room, I notice Chris and his mom engrossed in a conversation, speaking a little over a whisper. I let out a small cough so they notice I&rsquo;m here.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo; I nod and smile. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you join us sweetie, come.&rdquo; She pats the seat next to her. Not wanting to be rude, I sit next her. &ldquo;So how is Chris as a roommate. Thank you, by the way, for giving him a place to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well he-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N told me that he was a pain in the ass.&rdquo; Scott intervenes. Chris raises his eyebrow at me in shock. Lisa just laughs in pure amusement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; Chris inquires.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you are not.&rdquo; I reassure him. He nods in agreement. &ldquo;Not all the time, at least.&rdquo; I whisper to his mom, loud enough for Chris to hear.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; Chris exclaims, laughing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen honey, he&rsquo;s always been a pain in the ass. It&rsquo;s just about getting used to it. After a couple of years you will hardly notice.&rdquo; She tells me, I begin to laugh with her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this.&rdquo; Chris locks eyes with me &nbsp;lips curled into a smile, obviously enjoying this interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I gotta question. Does he sing to you before bed like he used to with me?&rdquo; Scott questions. My mouth falls open and I face Chris.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, Scott!&rdquo; Chris yells, but continues his fit of laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what?&rdquo; I shake my head in disbelief.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Scott, we don&rsquo;t need talk about that.&rdquo; Chris says, his mom is basically cackling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Scott turns to me and mouths&nbsp;&ldquo;Later&rdquo; and winks.</p><p>We spent the rest of the night listening to different stories from their childhood. His mom is the sweetest person alive and his brother is just downright amazing. I was genuinely interested in their life experience and living in Massachusetts.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So where are we sleeping?&rdquo; Lisa asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I was going to take the sofa and maybe you guys can figure out who can take my room.&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep on the sofa, mom you can sleep in my room.&rdquo; Chris replied.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And where do I go?&rdquo; Scott wondered.</p><p>&ldquo;My room.&rdquo; I responded.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Scott asked and I was stumped.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How about I sleep on the sofa, mom sleeps in Chris&rsquo;s room and you too bunk up.&rdquo; Scott suggests and I nearly choke on my spit.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Or how about you and mom stay in my room, Y/N stays in her&rsquo;s and I take the sofa.&rdquo; Chris advocates. I like that plan much better.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t sleep with other people, neither can mom. But I know you can. Also you won&rsquo;t even fit properly on the sofa.&rdquo; Scott advises. I wait for Lisa to say something along the lines of it morally wrong for a man and a woman to share a bed if they are unwed. But she must be a &lsquo;cool&rsquo; mom because she looks like she agrees with Scott and waits for Chris&rsquo;s answer. Chris doesn&rsquo;t say anything but just looks at me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay with whatever.&rdquo; Is all I can say. Let&rsquo;s be honest I&rsquo;m not really hating the idea but I have a feeling it&rsquo;s going to ruin the friends thing we have. Not like anything will happen. Of course not. It just might be weird. Chris stares at me, not fully believing that I&rsquo;m okay with it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a better way.&rdquo; Chris tells, mostly to me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m fine with it, are you?&rdquo; Chris looks at me, to his brother, back to me, then to his mother, back to me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I, okay.&rdquo;</p><p>I am dreading but also weirdly excited. Lord help me.&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>taglist:</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjSytOf70Vuk-IW_uSRR7rA\">@vnderoos</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4Lq8j5SC-VVyav6ZiWYuNA\">@h4ppydancing</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXJZ8rlTf4E6G1iq9c1kGrQ\">@tonightsnogoodhowaboutwednesday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRHnvlvZkGhP-HOw1fGxkw\">@icantbeliveitsnotbutter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/motxK41zKJMb2XJq3dvmWPA\">@thatoneperson5000</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4m8qVtCow2PkgWp7Jr4WGQ\">@pbnjparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\">@lokilvrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQhEywaJmfv6muDk8DFzg\">@jaiboomer11</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbaRq-ZK4D5vJRLKrIS75ZA\">@lokiloveheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mODJfoXg1PUrlZxKZELGtlA\">@fanfictionjunkie1112</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_yKt_loZCWj6B_XFHI8QoQ\">@achishisha</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8v_V2SwZwHdkAAaHmHd3zw\">@effielumiere</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpo3u_agz5EDs8FI_O8feKQ\">@deepfrz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5vtewUhYqnYONXGwEodNkw\">@smileygirl08</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZEyrzwCRV0BauE7O00jmyQ\">@everything-is-awesomesauce</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6VQvLeEQXdfSRKU_xv81vQ\">@whitewitchdown</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRi3VskABqbEWy2Qc7OV5qA\">@myles-production</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miPx7qe1krblF2km5nqCazQ\">@winnielinleigh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6PEwL_CwZBjUE9fELv2c6g\">@shawn-mendes-thirst</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgtK9BR0P09-yUWy1Mw3lNg\">@cap-just-said-language</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbX4sWNuBUXVcwsjALyT0uw\">@thegetawaywriter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msMK1ZjbOszUr5_kzwlQzMg\">@saccmaass</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/my2w9tiuyOt0XW4opZDBjoQ\">@odinson-barnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCi5-2ZBKegudIbCHPQ9m3A\">@aestheticallykelsey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msmAdAKERFWuI36t5nMR3ag\">@troublermalik</a> @strongpoweful-alive <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mavcs5ip6lav-ydCiRLr5cA\">@buckybarneshairpullingkink</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> </p></p>",

You were tempted to jump back into the taxi with him, rather than boarding the flight to LA to write your latest report for New York Magazine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh Joey, I don\u2019t want to go,\u201d you moaned into his ear, as you held him closer, ignoring the airport\u2019s crowd around you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go either sweetheart,\u201d he replied, hungrily pressing his lips to yours for the hundredth time that morning.<br/></p><p>As you opened your eyes, catching your breath from the passionate kiss, you were shocked to find a familiar face staring at you both from a little distance away.</p><p>Joe followed your eyes, smiled and waved eagerly at the stranger.</p><p>As you tried to piece together your thoughts, the stranger returned the wave and made his way through the crowd to greet you both.</p><p>As he walked closer, you realised who it was and an uneasy, anxious feeling spread through your body.\u00a0</p><p><i>I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s ruining mine and Joey\u2019s moment- stupid Chris Evans. Probably even more obnoxious now that he\u2019s in that Fantastic Four movie</i>, you thought.</p><!-- more --><p>You stood there awkwardly as Joe and Chris hugged briefly, slapping each other\u2019s backs.</p><p>\u201cHoney, this is Chris- he used to be my roommate in LA when I tried to make it as an actor. Of course, he\u2019s fared a lot better than me,\u201d Joe chuckled, as you and Chris shook hands and nodded to each other.</p><p><i>So he doesn\u2019t remember me? Huh? Interesting, </i>you thought.</p><p>\u201cNo way dude, you\u2019re killing it right now! I wish I had the balls to set up my own business! Good on ya!\u201d Chris said with his thick, Boston accent, punching Joe\u2019s arm playfully.</p><p>You giggled proudly and leaned in closer to Joe\u2019s side, entwining your fingers with his,\u00a0\u201cYeah, he\u2019s pretty awesome at what he does!\u201d you bragged, unable to stop yourself.</p><p>Joe shrugged his shoulders modestly, the redness rising in his cheeks, as he leaned down to place a few pecks on your lips slowly.</p><p>\u201cWell&hellip;I\u2019ll leave you guys to it! Gotta go catch this plane! It was nice seeing ya again Joe,\u201d Chris said, abruptly breaking up your kiss as him and Joe hugged again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He glanced in your direction and smiled,\u00a0\u201cNice meeting you,\u201d he said before walking off in the opposite direction.</p><p>As soon as Chris was out of earshot, you found yourself sighing heavily,\u00a0\u201cThank god, he didn\u2019t recognise me!\u201d you moaned to Joe.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he replied in confusion.<br/></p><p>You gave a quick 2-minute summary of the car ride from 5 years ago, before Joe laughed heartily.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d you whined.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard that story&hellip;trouble is, last time I heard it, it was coming from Chris\u2019 mouth and he was talking about a crazy Harvard girl who he offered a lift to and instead he said he got his ear chewed off,\u201d Joe chuckled, wiping away a tear.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh! So he can\u2019t have forgotten me then?! He was pretending! The little shit! And that whole time, I thought it was because of all the girls he must be seeing on a daily basis&hellip;.\u201d you trailed off, seeing the expression on Joe\u2019s face.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou sound jealous&hellip;are you sure there\u2019s not more to that car ride than you\u2019re letting on?\u201d he said suspiciously.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe Joe was asking you that and you spent the last ten minutes before the final boarding call trying to convince him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Joe finally sighed, still not meeting your eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cOk&hellip;I love you. See you in a couple of weeks,\u201d you said, craning up to reach his lips hesitantly.<br/></p><p>He pecked your lips quickly and gave a tight smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Have a safe flight,\u201d he said, squeezing your hand before letting it fall to your side.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Not wanting to miss your flight, you swiftly made your way towards the boarding gates and turned to wave him a final goodbye- feeling thankful that he was still waiting to see you off completely.</p><p>Reluctantly, you showed your tickets and passport and made your way across the jet-bridge, praying that you\u2019d have a window seat and wouldn\u2019t be sat next to a crying baby for the next several hours.</p><p>Unfortunately, the reality was much worse. You put your backpack in the overhead compartment and found yourself face-to-face with none other than <i>him</i>.\u00a0</p><p>The sides of Chris\u2019 mouth twitched slightly as you sat down on the right of his window seat.\u00a0</p><p>You could only hope that he would keep up the ploy of not knowing you; you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from placing the blame of yours and Joe\u2019s recent confrontation on Chris.</p><p>But as the plane started to fill up, he couldn\u2019t help himself and he turned to you with a huge smirk,\u00a0\u201cHey Harvard Girl,\u201d he whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t, Chris. I\u2019m really not in the mood.\u201d you said through gritted teeth.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat have I done now?! You can\u2019t seriously be holding a grudge for the past five years! That\u2019s crazy!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou like the word \u2018crazy\u2019 don\u2019t you, Evans?!\u201d you spat out.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?! Anyway, I was just planning to do the adult thing and apologise for pretending like I didn\u2019t recognise you before. I just didn\u2019t want to say anything awkward or negative about Joe\u2019s girl&hellip;ya know?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s girl? Yeah? Well&hellip; who knows for how much longer after what just happened,\u201d you muttered, blinking back the tears, as you thought about how you left things with Joe.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ya mean? What just happened?\u201d Chris said, looking at you with genuine sympathy.<br/></p><p>Unfortunately for him, you weren\u2019t feeling particularly rational or generous and you couldn\u2019t stand to sit next to him, knowing that he was the main catalyst for your argument with Joe.</p><p>You quickly turned to the guy in the seat directly behind you and asked if you could swap seats.</p><p>He thankfully obliged but as you went to stand up, Chris reached out for your hand.\u00a0You paused and gave him a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cOk listen, I don\u2019t like having issues with people&hellip;that car ride still plays on my mind at times? So&hellip;can we just put it to bed and at least be friends?\u201d he said earnestly.<br/></p><p>You appreciated his comments, especially as you also hated any type of confrontation. You took a deep breath and gathered your thoughts before you replied.</p><p>Finally, you smiled at him,\u00a0\u201cOk, consider it forgotten&hellip;Oh&hellip;but the friend thing?&hellip; I just don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a good idea,\u201d you said, thinking back to Joe\u2019s comments about the car ride situation being more than it was.\u00a0</p><p>And with that, you took your hand out of Chris\u2019 grasp, leaving him gaping in confusion as you took your seat in the row behind him.\u00a0</p><p>You fell asleep almost suddenly in your new seat and awoke just as the plane landed in LA.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the belt sign switched off overhead, you grabbed your backpack and rushed off the plane without a backwards glance: hoping to not see Chris\u2019 face again for a very long time.\u00a0</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p><b>Tag List:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\"></a><a

That\u2019s crazy!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou like the word \u2018crazy\u2019 don\u2019t you, Evans?!\u201d you spat out.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?! Anyway, I was just planning to do the adult thing and apologise for pretending like I didn\u2019t recognise you before. I just didn\u2019t want to say anything awkward or negative about Joe\u2019s girl\u2026ya know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s girl? Yeah?

What just happened?\u201d Chris said, looking at you with genuine sympathy.<br></p><p>Unfortunately for him, you weren\u2019t feeling particularly rational or generous and you couldn\u2019t stand to sit next to him, knowing that he was the main catalyst for your argument with Joe.</p><p>You quickly turned to the guy in the seat directly behind you and asked if you could swap seats.</p><p>He thankfully obliged but as you went to stand up, Chris reached out for your hand.\u00a0You paused and gave him a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cOk listen, I don\u2019t like having issues with people\u2026that car ride still plays on my mind at times? So\u2026can we just put it to bed and at least be friends?\u201d he said earnestly.<br></p><p>You appreciated his comments, especially as you also hated any type of confrontation.

think it\u2019d be a good idea,\u201d you said, thinking back to Joe\u2019s comments about the car ride situation being more than it was.\u00a0</p><p>And with that, you took your hand out of Chris\u2019 grasp, leaving him gaping in confusion as you took your seat in the row behind him.\u00a0</p><p>You fell asleep almost suddenly in your new seat and awoke just as the plane landed in LA.\u00a0</p><p>As soon as the belt sign switched off overhead, you grabbed your backpack and rushed off the plane without a backwards glance: hoping to not see Chris\u2019 face again for a very long

You were tempted to jump back into the taxi with him, rather than boarding the flight to LA to write your latest report for New York Magazine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUgh Joey, I don\u2019t want to go,\u201d you moaned into his ear, as you held him closer, ignoring the airport\u2019s crowd around you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go either sweetheart,\u201d he replied, hungrily pressing his lips to yours for the hundredth time that morning.<br></p><p>As you opened your eyes, catching your breath from the passionate kiss, you were shocked to find a familiar face staring at you both from a little distance away.</p><p>Joe followed your eyes, smiled and waved eagerly at the stranger.</p><p>As you tried to piece together your thoughts, the stranger returned the wave and made his way through the crowd to greet you both.</p><p>As he walked closer, you realised who it was and an uneasy, anxious feeling spread through your body.\u00a0</p><p><i>I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s ruining mine and Joey\u2019s moment- stupid Chris Evans. Probably even more obnoxious now that he\u2019s in that Fantastic Four movie</i>, you thought.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You stood there awkwardly as Joe and Chris hugged briefly, slapping each other\u2019s backs.</p><p>\u201cHoney, this is Chris- he used to be my roommate in LA when I tried to make it as an actor. Of course, he\u2019s fared a lot better than me,\u201d Joe chuckled, as you and Chris shook hands and nodded to each other.</p><p><i>So he doesn\u2019t remember me? Huh? Interesting, </i>you thought.</p><p>\u201cNo way dude, you\u2019re killing it right now! I wish I had the balls to set up my own business! Good on ya!\u201d Chris said with his thick, Boston accent, punching Joe\u2019s arm playfully.</p><p>You giggled proudly and leaned in closer to Joe\u2019s side, entwining your fingers with his,\u00a0\u201cYeah, he\u2019s pretty awesome at what he does!\u201d you bragged, unable to stop yourself.</p><p>Joe shrugged his shoulders modestly, the redness rising in his cheeks, as he leaned down to place a few pecks on your lips slowly.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026I\u2019ll leave you guys to it! Gotta go catch this plane! It was nice seeing ya again Joe,\u201d Chris said, abruptly breaking up your kiss as him and Joe hugged again.\u00a0<br></p><p>He glanced in your direction and smiled,\u00a0\u201cNice meeting you,\u201d he said before walking off in the opposite direction.</p><p>As soon as Chris was out of earshot, you found yourself sighing heavily,\u00a0\u201cThank god, he didn\u2019t recognise me!\u201d you moaned to Joe.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he replied in confusion.<br></p><p>You gave a quick 2-minute summary of the car ride from 5 years ago, before Joe laughed heartily.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d you whined.<br></p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard that story\u2026trouble is, last time I heard it, it was coming from Chris\u2019 mouth and he was talking about a crazy Harvard girl who he offered a lift to and instead he said he got his ear chewed off,\u201d Joe chuckled, wiping away a tear.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh! So he can\u2019t have forgotten me then?! He was pretending! The little shit! And that whole time, I thought it was because of all the girls he must be seeing on a daily basis\u2026.\u201d you trailed off, seeing the expression on Joe\u2019s face.<br></p><p>\u201cYou sound jealous\u2026are you sure there\u2019s not more to that car ride than you\u2019re letting on?\u201d he said suspiciously.\u00a0<br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe Joe was asking you that and you spent the last ten minutes before the final boarding call trying to convince him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Joe finally sighed, still not meeting your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cOk\u2026I love you. See you in a couple of weeks,\u201d you said, craning up to reach his lips hesitantly.<br></p><p>He pecked your lips quickly and gave a tight smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Have a safe flight,\u201d he said, squeezing your hand before letting it fall to your side.\u00a0<br></p><p>Not wanting to miss your flight, you swiftly made your way towards the boarding gates and turned to wave him a final goodbye- feeling thankful that he was still waiting to see you off completely.</p><p>Reluctantly, you showed your tickets and passport and made your way across the jet-bridge, praying that you\u2019d have a window seat and wouldn\u2019t be sat next to a crying baby for the next several hours.</p><p>Unfortunately, the reality was much worse. You put your backpack in the overhead compartment and found yourself face-to-face with none other than <i>him</i>.\u00a0</p><p>The sides of Chris\u2019 mouth twitched slightly as you sat down on the right of his window seat.\u00a0</p><p>You could only hope that he would keep up the ploy of not knowing you; you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from placing the blame of yours and Joe\u2019s recent confrontation on Chris.</p><p>But as the plane started to fill up, he couldn\u2019t help himself and he turned to you with a huge smirk,\u00a0\u201cHey Harvard Girl,\u201d he whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t, Chris. I\u2019m really not in the mood.\u201d you said through gritted teeth.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat have I done now?! You can\u2019t seriously be holding a grudge for the past five years! That\u2019s crazy!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou like the word \u2018crazy\u2019 don\u2019t you, Evans?!\u201d you spat out.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?! Anyway, I was just planning to do the adult thing and apologise for pretending like I didn\u2019t recognise you before. I just didn\u2019t want to say anything awkward or negative about Joe\u2019s girl\u2026ya know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s girl? Yeah? Well\u2026 who knows for how much longer after what just happened,\u201d you muttered, blinking back the tears, as you thought about how you left things with Joe.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ya mean? What just happened?\u201d Chris said, looking at you with genuine sympathy.<br></p><p>Unfortunately for him, you weren\u2019t feeling particularly rational or generous and you couldn\u2019t stand to sit next to him, knowing that he was the main catalyst for your argument with Joe.</p><p>You quickly turned to the guy in the seat directly behind you and asked if you could swap seats.</p><p>He thankfully obliged but as you went to stand up, Chris reached out for your hand.\u00a0You paused and gave him a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cOk listen, I don\u2019t like having issues with people\u2026that car ride still plays on my mind at times? So\u2026can we just put it to bed and at least be friends?\u201d he said earnestly.<br></p><p>You appreciated his comments, especially as you also hated any type of confrontation.

You were tempted to jump back into the taxi with him, rather than boarding the flight to LA to write your latest report for New York Magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh Joey, I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; you moaned into his ear, as you held him closer, ignoring the airport&rsquo;s crowd around you.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to go either sweetheart,&rdquo; he replied, hungrily pressing his lips to yours for the hundredth time that morning.<br /></p><p>As you opened your eyes, catching your breath from the passionate kiss, you were shocked to find a familiar face staring at you both from a little distance away.</p><p>Joe followed your eyes, smiled and waved eagerly at the stranger.</p><p>As you tried to piece together your thoughts, the stranger returned the wave and made his way through the crowd to greet you both.</p><p>As he walked closer, you realised who it was and an uneasy, anxious feeling spread through your body.&nbsp;</p><p><i>I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s ruining mine and Joey&rsquo;s moment- stupid Chris Evans. Probably even more obnoxious now that he&rsquo;s in that Fantastic Four movie</i>, you thought.</p><p>You stood there awkwardly as Joe and Chris hugged briefly, slapping each other&rsquo;s backs.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, this is Chris- he used to be my roommate in LA when I tried to make it as an actor. Of course, he&rsquo;s fared a lot better than me,&rdquo; Joe chuckled, as you and Chris shook hands and nodded to each other.</p><p><i>So he doesn&rsquo;t remember me? Huh? Interesting, </i>you thought.</p><p>&ldquo;No way dude, you&rsquo;re killing it right now! I wish I had the balls to set up my own business! Good on ya!&rdquo; Chris said with his thick, Boston accent, punching Joe&rsquo;s arm playfully.</p><p>You giggled proudly and leaned in closer to Joe&rsquo;s side, entwining your fingers with his,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s pretty awesome at what he does!&rdquo; you bragged, unable to stop yourself.</p><p>Joe shrugged his shoulders modestly, the redness rising in his cheeks, as he leaned down to place a few pecks on your lips slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;I&rsquo;ll leave you guys to it! Gotta go catch this plane! It was nice seeing ya again Joe,&rdquo; Chris said, abruptly breaking up your kiss as him and Joe hugged again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He glanced in your direction and smiled,&nbsp;&ldquo;Nice meeting you,&rdquo; he said before walking off in the opposite direction.</p><p>As soon as Chris was out of earshot, you found yourself sighing heavily,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank god, he didn&rsquo;t recognise me!&rdquo; you moaned to Joe.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he replied in confusion.<br /></p><p>You gave a quick 2-minute summary of the car ride from 5 years ago, before Joe laughed heartily.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you laughing?&rdquo; you whined.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve heard that story&hellip;trouble is, last time I heard it, it was coming from Chris&rsquo; mouth and he was talking about a crazy Harvard girl who he offered a lift to and instead he said he got his ear chewed off,&rdquo; Joe chuckled, wiping away a tear.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh! So he can&rsquo;t have forgotten me then?! He was pretending! The little shit! And that whole time, I thought it was because of all the girls he must be seeing on a daily basis&hellip;.&rdquo; you trailed off, seeing the expression on Joe&rsquo;s face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You sound jealous&hellip;are you sure there&rsquo;s not more to that car ride than you&rsquo;re letting on?&rdquo; he said suspiciously.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t believe Joe was asking you that and you spent the last ten minutes before the final boarding call trying to convince him otherwise.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, you&rsquo;re going to be late,&rdquo; Joe finally sighed, still not meeting your eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ok&hellip;I love you. See you in a couple of weeks,&rdquo; you said, craning up to reach his lips hesitantly.<br /></p><p>He pecked your lips quickly and gave a tight smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too. Have a safe flight,&rdquo; he said, squeezing your hand before letting it fall to your side.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Not wanting to miss your flight, you swiftly made your way towards the boarding gates and turned to wave him a final goodbye- feeling thankful that he was still waiting to see you off completely.</p><p>Reluctantly, you showed your tickets and passport and made your way across the jet-bridge, praying that you&rsquo;d have a window seat and wouldn&rsquo;t be sat next to a crying baby for the next several hours.</p><p>Unfortunately, the reality was much worse. You put your backpack in the overhead compartment and found yourself face-to-face with none other than <i>him</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>The sides of Chris&rsquo; mouth twitched slightly as you sat down on the right of his window seat.&nbsp;</p><p>You could only hope that he would keep up the ploy of not knowing you; you couldn&rsquo;t stop yourself from placing the blame of yours and Joe&rsquo;s recent confrontation on Chris.</p><p>But as the plane started to fill up, he couldn&rsquo;t help himself and he turned to you with a huge smirk,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey Harvard Girl,&rdquo; he whispered.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t, Chris. I&rsquo;m really not in the mood.&rdquo; you said through gritted teeth.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What have I done now?! You can&rsquo;t seriously be holding a grudge for the past five years! That&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You like the word &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you, Evans?!&rdquo; you spat out.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you on about?! Anyway, I was just planning to do the adult thing and apologise for pretending like I didn&rsquo;t recognise you before. I just didn&rsquo;t want to say anything awkward or negative about Joe&rsquo;s girl&hellip;ya know?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s girl? Yeah? Well&hellip; who knows for how much longer after what just happened,&rdquo; you muttered, blinking back the tears, as you thought about how you left things with Joe.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ya mean? What just happened?&rdquo; Chris said, looking at you with genuine sympathy.<br /></p><p>Unfortunately for him, you weren&rsquo;t feeling particularly rational or generous and you couldn&rsquo;t stand to sit next to him, knowing that he was the main catalyst for your argument with Joe.</p><p>You quickly turned to the guy in the seat directly behind you and asked if you could swap seats.</p><p>He thankfully obliged but as you went to stand up, Chris reached out for your hand.&nbsp;You paused and gave him a puzzled look.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok listen, I don&rsquo;t like having issues with people&hellip;that car ride still plays on my mind at times? So&hellip;can we just put it to bed and at least be friends?&rdquo; he said earnestly.<br /></p><p>You appreciated his comments, especially as you also hated any type of confrontation. You took a deep breath and gathered your thoughts before you replied.</p><p>Finally, you smiled at him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok, consider it forgotten&hellip;Oh&hellip;but the friend thing?&hellip; I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be a good idea,&rdquo; you said, thinking back to Joe&rsquo;s comments about the car ride situation being more than it was.&nbsp;</p><p>And with that, you took your hand out of Chris&rsquo; grasp, leaving him gaping in confusion as you took your seat in the row behind him.&nbsp;</p><p>You fell asleep almost suddenly in your new seat and awoke just as the plane landed in LA.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as the belt sign switched off overhead, you grabbed your backpack and rushed off the plane without a backwards glance: hoping to not see Chris&rsquo; face again for a very

You were tempted to jump back into the taxi with him, rather than boarding the flight to LA to write your latest report for New York Magazine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ugh Joey, I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; you moaned into his ear, as you held him closer, ignoring the airport&rsquo;s crowd around you.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to go either sweetheart,&rdquo; he replied, hungrily pressing his lips to yours for the hundredth time that morning.<br /></p>\n<p>As you opened your eyes, catching your breath from the passionate kiss, you were shocked to find a familiar face staring at you both from a little distance away.</p>\n<p>Joe followed your eyes, smiled and waved eagerly at the stranger.</p>\n<p>As you tried to piece together your thoughts, the stranger returned the wave and made his way through the crowd to greet you both.</p>\n<p>As he walked closer, you realised who it was and an uneasy, anxious feeling spread through your body.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s ruining mine and Joey&rsquo;s moment- stupid Chris Evans. Probably even more obnoxious now that he&rsquo;s in that Fantastic Four movie</i>, you thought.</p>\n</p>",

Seb turned off the car engine and I took this chance to unlock the car door and step outside. The cool night breeze blew at my face and it felt nice like I could breathe again. I crossed my arms as I leaned against the car door staring at the empty darkness. The sand and dirt swept against my heels. After everything that happened tonight, this peace was mentally and physically welcomed.</p><p>A second later, I heard the car door open and close behind me. As Seb walked up to me, \u00a0I watched him take off his suit jacket. He stood in front of me as he wrapped the jacket around my body. I felt his warmth radiating against my body. The feeling was equivalent to burying yourself on your bed after a stressful day at work.</p><p>Seb softly leaned against the car next to me. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s going to be there whether it\u2019s the hotel or your place back at Boston,\u201d Seb sighed and paused. \u201cYou can stay over at my place.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled in defeat. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was supposed to be running from him. It\u2019s <i>just</i> Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not <i>just</i> Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the same Chris you and I knew for years, Seb. I\u2019m going to be okay.\u201d Was I trying to convince myself?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you getting hurt,\u201d he whispered. From the corner of my eyes, I knew that he was staring at me, but I didn\u2019t want to look at him. I knew the moment I turned, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back my tears. I kept my eyes facing forward.</p><p>\u201cSeb,\u201d I started. \u201cI appreciate everything you did for me today, but this is my problem and I can take of myself,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t know if this was true, but I thought if I said it out loud, maybe it would happen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t take care of it, Julie,\u201d he paused. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you getting hurt from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s too late</i>,\u201d I whispered. My\u00a0heart was torn&hellip; no, shredded into microscopic pieces. I remembered Chris\u2019 last text before arrived at the premiere.</p><p><b>Stay at the hotel.</b></p><p>I bit my lips and looked down at my feet. \u201c<i>Seb, why am I so stubborn? Why did I turn back?</i>\u201d I heard my voice wavering as I was fighting to hold my tears back. Sebastian reached out his arm, wrapped it around my shoulder and pulled me in. I smelled the subtle hint of his familiar cologne greeted me as I buried my face into his chest. The moment my face touched his shirt, the tears quietly rained down uncontrollably.</p><p>Between my sobs, I heard his soft voice.</p><p>\u201c<i>Shh, it\u2019s going to be alright</i>,\u201d he muttered.</p><p><br/></p><p>- - s a m e \u00a0d a y\u00a0 , \u00a0f e w \u00a0h o u r s \u00a0a g o\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Beep.

Frustrated, I threw the blankets on top of my head shut the alarm, but realized my phone was inside my blankets.<i> Ugh.</i></p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I shouted as I got up from my bed. The sun was beaming through the hotel room windows and I glanced over at the digital clock on the end table.</p><p><b>10:03 AM</b></p><p>I would have long past overslept if this was a regular work day (adding the three hour time difference from Boston), but today was my debut on the red carpet. I glanced over at the red gown hanging on my small clothes rack. Well, okay let me rephrase that. It wasn\u2019t my debut. It was Chris and Seb\u2019s Avenger\u2019s Endgame premiere.</p><p>I looked over at the simple and modest dress I settled on after months of searching. I had the hardest time looking for a classic even gown and finding one that fit my budget was close to impossible. Celebrities had luxury sponsors and I had a trusty old friend, Google. I looked over at the mirror and my half-awake wildling-self looked back at me.</p><p><i>Yep. I had a lot of work to do.</i></p><p>I turned on the hot water for the bathtub as I threw my PJs on the floor. Chris offered to have a limo come pick me up for a full A-list treatment tonight, but I refused. I wanted to put in the effort to prepare for this. Especially if what Chris said was really happening. I felt my cheeks blush just at the slightest thought of what was going to happen tonight.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI want us to go public,\u201d Chris said casually as he was washing the dishes.</p><p>I turned to look at him in confusion as I added the last dinner plates to the sink. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He turned off the water and turned his body towards me. His hands were still covered in soap and dripping with water. \u201cYou know, you and me going public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean going pu-\u201d I stopped my mid-sentence as I finally understood what he meant. He wanted to tell people about our relationship. I almost choked on my own breath. \u201cChris,\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of these pointless articles always pairing me up with people,\u201d he finished. \u201cYou know, the other day Robert linked me a fanfiction novel pairing me up with him.\u201d</p><p>Huh, he obviously didn\u2019t look the numerous fanfictions with him and Seb. I smiled at my voice inside my head and he frowned. \u201cJules, I\u2019m serious about this.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t lose my smile. Too much time around Chris did this to you. \u201cChris, the fanfics can\u2019t be controlled. We might have to brainstorm another way to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>Chris took a step closer to me and reached for my hand. He intertwined his soapy fingers with mine. \u201cI want to make us official. It\u2019s been two years. I <i><b>know</b></i> I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>My heart skipped a beat as I gazed at his baby blue eyes. \u201cMmn\u2026 is this supposed to be a proposal?\u201d I asked and he shook his head.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThis is just me trying to let the world know about the most beautiful, kind-hearted, and warm soul I\u2019ve kept to myself all these years.\u201d</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I glanced over at my phone again.</p><p><b>4:05 PM</b></p><p>I had a car scheduled to pick me up from my hotel in an hour and I just finished my eyeliner after a straight hour of drawing and erasing. My sensitive skin around my eyes was begging me to stop. My eyes constantly shifted from the time to the mirror. I hurriedly made finishing touches with blush, soft-glowing highlighter, and mascara. I grabbed the matte red lipstick from my purse and put it over my lips. I let my soft waves down and looked at myself in accomplishment.</p><p><b><i>You look beautiful, Jules.</i></b></p><p>Chris\u2019 voice echoed my head and I felt my face growing warmer. I couldn\u2019t wait until we were back in my apartment in Boston after all this. Shaking my head, I quickly threw my phone and my lipstick in my small clutch. I walked over to my gown and got in my dress. I pulled out a new pair of nude heels I bought for this event. After I was done, I stood in front of the full-size mirror and looked at myself.</p><p><i>I felt beautiful.</i></p><p><i>This feeling was rare and much welcomed right now.</i></p><p><i>This was exactly how I wanted to look \u201cgoing public\u201d with the man of my life</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The Lyft driver was so confused when I gave him the address to the premiere. After circling the area a dozen times to be stopped by blocked roads, he dropped me off about two blocks from the location.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best I could do,\u201d he said in a monotone as the car came to a stop.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as I got out of the taxi holding on to my gown. I didn\u2019t expect my Lyft to pull up to the red carpet, but I also didn\u2019t think that I would be walking myself to the premiere. Thankfully, these streets were empty and I only got one or two glances from the occasional dog walkers. I watched as my driver drove off and I stood there on the sidewalk with my long scarlet evening gown. I pulled a hair tie from my clutch and put my hair up to a messy bun. <i>What was the worst that could happen?</i></p><p>I walked the streets leading to the Los Angeles Convention Center. As I got closer, the people on the streets exponentially duplicated as well. I saw people dressed up as Iron Man, Captain America, Captain Marvel\u2026 wait did I just see a Groot? While I was busy staring at all the cosplayers, I realized that my red dress was noticed less and less. <i><b>Whew.</b></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Was I just supposed to show up? Where was the entrance? </i>Chris told me to just tell the guards to get him, but I was convinced that was the number one way to get kicked out by security. I reached for my phone in my clutch. When I looked at my phone, I had one text from Chris. Perfect timing.</p><p><b>Stay at the hotel.</b></p><p><b><i>What?</i></b></p><p>I stood there staring at my phone in confusion. The text arrived 5 minutes ago. What did he mean? I was about to press call when a loud honk startled me. I looked over at the street where a pitch black Cadillac sedan was stopped.</p><p><i>What was this guys problem?</i></p><p>I took a few steps and the car slowly matched my pace next to me. Was it following me? I stopped and the car did the same. I saw more people staring at my direction as they walked by. I turned to face the car and the passenger side door opened. From the seat, Frank (Seb\u2019s newbie assistant) came out of the car.</p><p>\u201cFra-\u201d I started to say as he turned and opened the back seat door facing me.</p><p>\u201cMs. Julie,\u201d Frank said bowing with his cute black tux and bow.</p><p>By this point, every pair of eyes were on me at this and I quickly made my way into the car. When I got in, a familiar figure was sitting on the other side.</p><p>\u201cWere you really planning to walk yourself there?\u201d Seb asked and I sighed in relief. The car drove off once Frank got back in the car.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d I asked and he looked back at me diverting his gaze to my dress. <i>Oh, jeez.</i> I was about to throw a comment about how I actually took a Lyft here when I realized it could wait. He was wearing a fitted light blue suit with a simple white shirt underneath. He always looked good no matter what he wore.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThank you. And you look stunning,\u201d he smiled back. There was something about the way he said that. I was flattered by his genuine compliment, but something felt missing.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chris?\u201d He asked.</p><p><b>Chris.</b></p><p>The name reminded me of the text and I frantically reached for my phone.</p><p>\u201cJules?\u201d Seb asked.</p><p>I opened the text again. No replies or anything. \u201cSeb, I think I have to go back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, what do you mean?\u201d he asked, but it was too late. I didn\u2019t realize the car had already stopped and Frank was on the other side of the open door.</p><p>\u201cJust go straight from here and it will take you to the purple carpet path,\u201d Frank said as he held the door for me to get off. I stood by the car after I got off and Seb got out from the other side.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you have to go back?\u201d Seb asked again. I handed my phone to him with Chris\u2019 text pulled up. His face narrowed and handed my phone back to me. \u201cHe should be around here somewhere. I\u2019ll look for him and Frank can take you to the venue.\u201d</p><p>Frank nodded as he shut the door behind me. Seb jogged off toward the carpet area and the car drove off leaving me and Frank behind.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Frank assured me with a nervous smile. \u201cYou can follow me.\u201d <i>[A/N: This is some foreshadowing, you guys already know if nothing were to happen after this there would be no story.]</i></p>",

Seb turned off the car engine and I took this chance to unlock the car door and step outside. The cool night breeze blew at my face and it felt nice like I could breathe again. I crossed my arms as I leaned against the car door staring at the empty darkness. The sand and dirt swept against my heels. After everything that happened tonight, this peace was mentally and physically welcomed.</p><p>A second later, I heard the car door open and close behind me. As Seb walked up to me, \u00a0I watched him take off his suit jacket. He stood in front of me as he wrapped the jacket around my body. I felt his warmth radiating against my body. The feeling was equivalent to burying yourself on your bed after a stressful day at work.</p><p>Seb softly leaned against the car next to me. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s going to be there whether it\u2019s the hotel or your place back at Boston,\u201d Seb sighed and paused. \u201cYou can stay over at my place.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled in defeat. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was supposed to be running from him. It\u2019s <i>just</i> Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not <i>just</i> Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the same Chris you and I knew for years, Seb. I\u2019m going to be okay.\u201d Was I trying to convince myself?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you getting hurt,\u201d he whispered. From the corner of my eyes, I knew that he was staring at me, but I didn\u2019t want to look at him. I knew the moment I turned, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back my tears. I kept my eyes facing forward.</p><p>\u201cSeb,\u201d I started. \u201cI appreciate everything you did for me today, but this is my problem and I can take of myself,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t know if this was true, but I thought if I said it out loud, maybe it would happen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t take care of it, Julie,\u201d he paused. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you getting hurt from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s too late</i>,\u201d I whispered. My\u00a0heart was torn\u2026 no, shredded into microscopic pieces. I remembered Chris\u2019 last text before arrived at the premiere.</p><p><b>Stay at the hotel.</b></p><p>I bit my lips and looked down at my feet. \u201c<i>Seb, why am I so stubborn? Why did I turn back?</i>\u201d I heard my voice wavering as I was fighting to hold my tears back. Sebastian reached out his arm, wrapped it around my shoulder and pulled me in. I smelled the subtle hint of his familiar cologne greeted me as I buried my face into his chest. The moment my face touched his shirt, the tears quietly rained down uncontrollably.</p><p>Between my sobs, I heard his soft voice.</p><p>\u201c<i>Shh, it\u2019s going to be alright</i>,\u201d he muttered.</p><p><br></p><p>- - s a m e \u00a0d a y\u00a0 , \u00a0f e w \u00a0h o u r s \u00a0a g o\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>Beep. Beep. Beep.</i></b><br></p><p>My phone alarm blared. Frustrated, I threw the blankets on top of my head shut the alarm, but realized my phone was inside my blankets.<i> Ugh.</i></p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I shouted as I got up from my bed. The sun was beaming through the hotel room windows and I glanced over at the digital clock on the end table.</p><p><b>10:03 AM</b></p><p>I would have long past overslept if this was a regular work day (adding the three hour time difference from Boston), but today was my debut on the red carpet. I glanced over at the red gown hanging on my small clothes rack. Well, okay let me rephrase that. It wasn\u2019t my debut. It was Chris and Seb\u2019s Avenger\u2019s Endgame premiere.</p><p>I looked over at the simple and modest dress I settled on after months of searching. I had the hardest time looking for a classic even gown and finding one that fit my budget was close to impossible. Celebrities had luxury sponsors and I had a trusty old friend, Google. I looked over at the mirror and my half-awake wildling-self looked back at me.</p><p><i>Yep. I had a lot of work to do.</i></p><p>I turned on the hot water for the bathtub as I threw my PJs on the floor. Chris offered to have a limo come pick me up for a full A-list treatment tonight, but I refused. I wanted to put in the effort to prepare for this. Especially if what Chris said was really happening. I felt my cheeks blush just at the slightest thought of what was going to happen tonight.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI want us to go public,\u201d Chris said casually as he was washing the dishes.</p><p>I turned to look at him in confusion as I added the last dinner plates to the sink. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He turned off the water and turned his body towards me. His hands were still covered in soap and dripping with water. \u201cYou know, you and me going public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean going pu-\u201d I stopped my mid-sentence as I finally understood what he meant. He wanted to tell people about our relationship. I almost choked on my own breath. \u201cChris,\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of these pointless articles always pairing me up with people,\u201d he finished. \u201cYou know, the other day Robert linked me a fanfiction novel pairing me up with him.\u201d</p><p>Huh, he obviously didn\u2019t look the numerous fanfictions with him and Seb. I smiled at my voice inside my head and he frowned. \u201cJules, I\u2019m serious about this.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t lose my smile. Too much time around Chris did this to you. \u201cChris, the fanfics can\u2019t be controlled. We might have to brainstorm another way to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>Chris took a step closer to me and reached for my hand. He intertwined his soapy fingers with mine. \u201cI want to make us official. It\u2019s been two years. I <i><b>know</b></i> I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>My heart skipped a beat as I gazed at his baby blue eyes. \u201cMmn\u2026 is this supposed to be a proposal?\u201d I asked and he shook his head.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThis is just me trying to let the world know about the most beautiful, kind-hearted, and warm soul I\u2019ve kept to myself all these years.\u201d</b></i></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>I glanced over at my phone again.</p><p><b>4:05 PM</b></p><p>I had a car scheduled to pick me up from my hotel in an hour and I just finished my eyeliner after a straight hour of drawing and erasing. My sensitive skin around my eyes was begging me to stop. My eyes constantly shifted from the time to the mirror. I hurriedly made finishing touches with blush, soft-glowing highlighter, and mascara. I grabbed the matte red lipstick from my purse and put it over my lips. I let my soft waves down and looked at myself in accomplishment.</p><p><b><i>You look beautiful, Jules.</i></b></p><p>Chris\u2019 voice echoed my head and I felt my face growing warmer. I couldn\u2019t wait until we were back in my apartment in Boston after all this. Shaking my head, I quickly threw my phone and my lipstick in my small clutch.

Seb turned off the car engine and I took this chance to unlock the car door and step outside. The cool night breeze blew at my face and it felt nice like I could breathe again. I crossed my arms as I leaned against the car door staring at the empty darkness. The sand and dirt swept against my heels. After everything that happened tonight, this peace was mentally and physically welcomed.</p><p>A second later, I heard the car door open and close behind me. As Seb walked up to me, &nbsp;I watched him take off his suit jacket. He stood in front of me as he wrapped the jacket around my body. I felt his warmth radiating against my body. The feeling was equivalent to burying yourself on your bed after a stressful day at work.</p><p>Seb softly leaned against the car next to me. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; I replied.</p><p>&ldquo;You know he&rsquo;s going to be there whether it&rsquo;s the hotel or your place back at Boston,&rdquo; Seb sighed and paused. &ldquo;You can stay over at my place.&rdquo;</p><p>I exhaled in defeat. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was supposed to be running from him. It&rsquo;s <i>just</i> Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>just</i> Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the same Chris you and I knew for years, Seb. I&rsquo;m going to be okay.&rdquo; Was I trying to convince myself?</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you getting hurt,&rdquo; he whispered. From the corner of my eyes, I knew that he was staring at me, but I didn&rsquo;t want to look at him. I knew the moment I turned, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hold back my tears. I kept my eyes facing forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Seb,&rdquo; I started. &ldquo;I appreciate everything you did for me today, but this is my problem and I can take of myself,&rdquo; I said. I didn&rsquo;t know if this was true, but I thought if I said it out loud, maybe it would happen.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that you can&rsquo;t take care of it, Julie,&rdquo; he paused. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want you getting hurt from this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s too late</i>,&rdquo; I whispered. My&nbsp;heart was torn&hellip; no, shredded into microscopic pieces. I remembered Chris&rsquo; last text before arrived at the premiere.</p><p><b>Stay at the hotel.</b></p><p>I bit my lips and looked down at my feet. &ldquo;<i>Seb, why am I so stubborn? Why did I turn back?</i>&rdquo; I heard my voice wavering as I was fighting to hold my tears back. Sebastian reached out his arm, wrapped it around my shoulder and pulled me in. I smelled the subtle hint of his familiar cologne greeted me as I buried my face into his chest. The moment my face touched his shirt, the tears quietly rained down uncontrollably.</p><p>Between my sobs, I heard his soft voice.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shh, it&rsquo;s going to be alright</i>,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p><br /></p><p>- - s a m e &nbsp;d a y&nbsp; , &nbsp;f e w &nbsp;h o u r s &nbsp;a g o&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><b><i>Beep. Beep. Beep.</i></b><br /></p><p>My phone alarm blared. Frustrated, I threw the blankets on top of my head shut the alarm, but realized my phone was inside my blankets.<i> Ugh.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; I shouted as I got up from my bed. The sun was beaming through the hotel room windows and I glanced over at the digital clock on the end table.</p><p><b>10:03 AM</b></p><p>I would have long past overslept if this was a regular work day (adding the three hour time difference from Boston), but today was my debut on the red carpet. I glanced over at the red gown hanging on my small clothes rack. Well, okay let me rephrase that. It wasn&rsquo;t my debut. It was Chris and Seb&rsquo;s Avenger&rsquo;s Endgame premiere.</p><p>I looked over at the simple and modest dress I settled on after months of searching. I had the hardest time looking for a classic even gown and finding one that fit my budget was close to impossible. Celebrities had luxury sponsors and I had a trusty old friend, Google. I looked over at the mirror and my half-awake wildling-self looked back at me.</p><p><i>Yep. I had a lot of work to do.</i></p><p>I turned on the hot water for the bathtub as I threw my PJs on the floor. Chris offered to have a limo come pick me up for a full A-list treatment tonight, but I refused. I wanted to put in the effort to prepare for this. Especially if what Chris said was really happening. I felt my cheeks blush just at the slightest thought of what was going to happen tonight.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want us to go public,&rdquo; Chris said casually as he was washing the dishes.</p><p>I turned to look at him in confusion as I added the last dinner plates to the sink. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>He turned off the water and turned his body towards me. His hands were still covered in soap and dripping with water. &ldquo;You know, you and me going public.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean going pu-&rdquo; I stopped my mid-sentence as I finally understood what he meant. He wanted to tell people about our relationship. I almost choked on my own breath. &ldquo;Chris,&rdquo; I started.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of these pointless articles always pairing me up with people,&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;You know, the other day Robert linked me a fanfiction novel pairing me up with him.&rdquo;</p><p>Huh, he obviously didn&rsquo;t look the numerous fanfictions with him and Seb. I smiled at my voice inside my head and he frowned. &ldquo;Jules, I&rsquo;m serious about this.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t lose my smile. Too much time around Chris did this to you. &ldquo;Chris, the fanfics can&rsquo;t be controlled. We might have to brainstorm another way to deal with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris took a step closer to me and reached for my hand. He intertwined his soapy fingers with mine. &ldquo;I want to make us official. It&rsquo;s been two years. I <i><b>know</b></i> I want to be with you.&rdquo;</p><p>My heart skipped a beat as I gazed at his baby blue eyes. &ldquo;Mmn&hellip; is this supposed to be a proposal?&rdquo; I asked and he shook his head.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;This is just me trying to let the world know about the most beautiful, kind-hearted, and warm soul I&rsquo;ve kept to myself all these years.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I glanced over at my phone again.</p><p><b>4:05 PM</b></p><p>I had a car scheduled to pick me up from my hotel in an hour and I just finished my eyeliner after a straight hour of drawing and erasing. My sensitive skin around my eyes was begging me to stop. My eyes constantly shifted from the time to the mirror. I hurriedly made finishing touches with blush, soft-glowing highlighter, and mascara. I grabbed the matte red lipstick from my purse and put it over my lips. I let my soft waves down and looked at myself in accomplishment.</p><p><b><i>You look beautiful, Jules.</i></b></p><p>Chris&rsquo; voice echoed my head and I felt my face growing warmer. I couldn&rsquo;t wait until we were back in my apartment in Boston after all this. Shaking my head, I quickly threw my phone and my lipstick in my small clutch. I walked over to my gown and got in my dress. I pulled out a new pair of nude heels I bought for this event. After I was done, I stood in front of the full-size mirror and looked at myself.</p><p><i>I felt beautiful.</i></p><p><i>This feeling was rare and much welcomed right now.</i></p><p><i>This was exactly how I wanted to look &ldquo;going public&rdquo; with the man of my life</i>.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The Lyft driver was so confused when I gave him the address to the premiere. After circling the area a dozen times to be stopped by blocked roads, he dropped me off about two blocks from the location.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the best I could do,&rdquo; he said in a monotone as the car came to a stop.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said as I got out of the taxi holding on to my gown. I didn&rsquo;t expect my Lyft to pull up to the red carpet, but I also didn&rsquo;t think that I would be walking myself to the premiere. Thankfully, these streets were empty and I only got one or two glances from the occasional dog walkers. I watched as my driver drove off and I stood there on the sidewalk with my long scarlet evening gown. I pulled a hair tie from my clutch and put my hair up to a messy bun. <i>What was the worst that could happen?</i></p><p>I walked the streets leading to the Los Angeles Convention Center. As I got closer, the people on the streets exponentially duplicated as well. I saw people dressed up as Iron Man, Captain America, Captain Marvel&hellip; wait did I just see a Groot? While I was busy staring at all the cosplayers, I realized that my red dress was noticed less and less. <i><b>Whew.</b></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>Was I just supposed to show up? Where was the entrance? </i>Chris told me to just tell the guards to get him, but I was convinced that was the number one way to get kicked out by security. I reached for my phone in my clutch. When I looked at my phone, I had one text from Chris. Perfect timing.</p><p><b>Stay at the hotel.</b></p><p><b><i>What?</i></b></p><p>I stood there staring at my phone in confusion. The text arrived 5 minutes ago. What did he mean? I was about to press call when a loud honk startled me. I looked over at the street where a pitch black Cadillac sedan was stopped.</p><p><i>What was this guys problem?</i></p><p>I took a few steps and the car slowly matched my pace next to me. Was it following me? I stopped and the car did the same. I saw more people staring at my direction as they walked by. I turned to face the car and the passenger side door opened. From the seat, Frank (Seb&rsquo;s newbie assistant) came out of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Fra-&rdquo; I started to say as he turned and opened the back seat door facing me.</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Julie,&rdquo; Frank said bowing with his cute black tux and bow.</p><p>By this point, every pair of eyes were on me at this and I quickly made my way into the car. When I got in, a familiar figure was sitting on the other side.</p><p>&ldquo;Were you really planning to walk yourself there?&rdquo; Seb asked and I sighed in relief. The car drove off once Frank got back in the car.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you find me?&rdquo; I asked and he looked back at me diverting his gaze to my dress. <i>Oh, jeez.</i> I was about to throw a comment about how I actually took a Lyft here when I realized it could wait. He was wearing a fitted light blue suit with a simple white shirt underneath. He always looked good no matter what he wore.</p><p>&ldquo;You look nice,&rdquo; I said, smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. And you look stunning,&rdquo; he smiled back. There was something about the way he said that. I was flattered by his genuine compliment, but something felt missing.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Chris?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p><b>Chris.</b></p><p>The name reminded me of the text and I frantically reached for my phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Jules?&rdquo; Seb asked.</p><p>I opened the text again. No replies or anything. &ldquo;Seb, I think I have to go back to the hotel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh, what do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, but it was too late. I didn&rsquo;t realize the car had already stopped and Frank was on the other side of the open door.</p><p>&ldquo;Just go straight from here and it will take you to the purple carpet path,&rdquo; Frank said as he held the door for me to get off. I stood by the car after I got off and Seb got out from the other side.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean you have to go back?&rdquo; Seb asked again. I handed my phone to him with Chris&rsquo; text pulled up. His face narrowed and handed my phone back to me. &ldquo;He should be around here somewhere. I&rsquo;ll look for him and Frank can take you to the venue.&rdquo;</p><p>Frank nodded as he shut the door behind me. Seb jogged off toward the carpet area and the car drove off leaving me and Frank behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Frank assured me with a nervous smile. &ldquo;You can follow me.&rdquo; <i>[A/N: This is some foreshadowing, you guys already know if nothing were to happen after this there would be no story.]</i></p></p>",
