That\u2019s literally it. Just keep as calm and relaxed as possible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded and walked over to the chair and PJ followed and sat down as well. The director was sitting in his chair a fair ways away from them and the way the cameras were situated made Phil feel a little bit better because his limited film knowledge gave him the impression they were definitely not the focus of the shot.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd that became even more clear that they were not the focus of the shot when he caught someone walking to set out of the corner of his eye. And that person was currently speaking to a shorter woman next to him as he walked closer to the director.\u00a0</p><p>\tDaniel Howell was going to be in this shot too. And he was standing right there on the edge of the set, with his hair perfectly styled and his suit impeccably tailored\u2015completely wrinkle and spot free.

It didn\u2019t feel too terribly awkward but Phil found it hard to carry on a conversation with PJ in the background while Dan was filming a scene less than ten feet in front of him.</p><p>\tWhen the director yelled cut, a bunch of people immediately ran over to Daniel and began to prod him and redo his hair and makeup although Phil couldn\u2019t see where there was any change in what he looked like.\u00a0</p><p>\tAs he continues to watch and stare at Daniel, Daniel suddenly turns and looks at him. It\u2019s a quick glare but it reaches inside of Phil\u2019s soul. It\u2019s like their eyes met and just sunk into each other.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut then, as if the small glance wasn\u2019t enough, Daniel lifted his chin and flashed him a big smile before drawing his lips into a tight line and turning to go back to the makeup artist who was brushing something over his forehead.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel just smiled at me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNever pegged you as a fan girl.\u201d PJ joked. \u201cNot after all you said about him yesterday.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut this was a genuine smile.\u201d Phil comments. \u201cLike he looked right at me and smiled.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCalm down, mate.\u201d PJ laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure he smiles at most people. He\u2019s not a robot.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cBesides, how did your mind change so fast after all you said yesterday?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not saying my mind changed!\u201d Phil countered. \u201cI\u2019m just merely commenting that he smiled at me and it was&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, you;re actually going to have an anxiety attack over this. Calm down. It was just a smile.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil huffed but he found himself laughing. PJ was right. It wasn\u2019t something to get worked up over.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know how many times they called to redo the shoot but he was extremely glad to be done so he could head home.

The BBC has done all of the other paperwork, but we just need a written signature from you both.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tShe handed a sheet of paper to them both and a couple of pens. \u201cWe\u2019ll call for you when you\u2019re ready but you both can just hang out here until then.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLove that the BBC volunteered us to be extras and we\u2019re just going to be sitting here all day on our arses waiting for them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sighed and scrabbled his signature on the form, remembering what the BBC had emailed him the night before about this being a scheduled work day for him technically.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t even recognize anyone here from our department.\u201d Phil says, looking around the room to see what looked like random people all on their laptops or cell phones.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cGemma must be crushed right now.\u201d PJ says with a slight chuckle. \u201cI mean, I feel bad that she\u2019s not here but at the same time, it\u2019s probably for the best.

The one with Daniel Howell being the front page story.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe clicked on the Twitter moment and read through some of the tweets.\u00a0</p><p><b>\t@danielhowell\u00a0</b></p><p><i>\tJust arrived in London!

He might be able to keep himself occupied with some dogs or slime.\u00a0</p><p>\tLow and behold, Daniel Howell\u2019s Instagram was the first photo to come up on his explore page and he curses the fact that all social media platforms are essentially linked in this way.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he finds himself clicking on the photo and looking at it.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s a photo of Dan with a dog in his arms. The caption reads: the only reason I come home for christmas sorry literally every other family member.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil hasn\u2019t ever kept up with celebrities enough to know much about them but Phil has to admit that if that was Dan\u2019s dog, it was a cute dog.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI see you Instagram stalking Daniel.\u201d PJ says over his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil jumps and closes out of the app.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be cheeky about it.\u201d PJ continues with a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you secretly fancy him and get off to his photos in your spare time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPeej!\u201d Phil exclaimed as PJ stifled a laugh. \u201cFor your information, his photo came up on my explore page and I happened to click on it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh\u2026happened to click on it. Right mate.\u201d PJ says with a laugh. \u201cCheers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe door to the room they were in opened and the same woman that had spoke to PJ and Phil earlier was peeking her head in. \u201cPJ and Phil, we\u2019re ready to film part of the background scene you\u2019re in. If you want to give me your forms and follow me, we can get you in and out within a few hours.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil wanted to groan. A few hours?! He could have been at home with Spike but instead he had to have Martyn come over and have a play date with Spike because he didn\u2019t know how long he was going to be.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe stood up and grabbed the paper and then he followed PJ out of the office. The women directed them to a smaller office on the other side of the floor where there were already people waiting with the cameras and lighting set up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, we just need you both to go sit in those chairs and talk. That\u2019s literally it. Just keep as calm and relaxed as possible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded and walked over to the chair and PJ followed and sat down as well. The director was sitting in his chair a fair ways away from them and the way the cameras were situated made Phil feel a little bit better because his limited film knowledge gave him the impression they were definitely not the focus of the shot.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd that became even more clear that they were not the focus of the shot when he caught someone walking to set out of the corner of his eye. And that person was currently speaking to a shorter woman next to him as he walked closer to the director.\u00a0</p><p>\tDaniel Howell was going to be in this shot too. And he was standing right there on the edge of the set, with his hair perfectly styled and his suit impeccably tailored\u2015completely wrinkle and spot free. And when he flashed a smile at the director, it was actually blinding.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil snapped out of his stare and turned to PJ. \u201cHuh?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou were ogling him Phil. Like full on drooling.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWas not.\u201d Phil says, settling into the chair and putting his arms over his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe director interrupted them and went over how the scene was going to go and then before they knew it, they were filming and it was happening. It didn\u2019t feel too terribly awkward but Phil found it hard to carry on a conversation with PJ in the background while Dan was filming a scene less than ten feet in front of him.</p><p>\tWhen the director yelled cut, a bunch of people immediately ran over to Daniel and began to prod him and redo his hair and makeup although Phil couldn\u2019t see where there was any change in what he looked like.\u00a0</p><p>\tAs he continues to watch and stare at Daniel, Daniel suddenly turns and looks at him.

The caption reads: the only reason I come home for christmas sorry literally every other family member.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil hasn&rsquo;t ever kept up with celebrities enough to know much about them but Phil has to admit that if that was Dan&rsquo;s dog, it was a cute dog.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I see you Instagram stalking Daniel.&rdquo; PJ says over his shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil jumps and closes out of the app.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be cheeky about it.&rdquo; PJ continues with a laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if you secretly fancy him and get off to his photos in your spare time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Peej!&rdquo; Phil exclaimed as PJ stifled a laugh. &ldquo;For your information, his photo came up on my explore page and I happened to click on it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh&hellip;happened to click on it. Right mate.&rdquo; PJ says with a laugh. &ldquo;Cheers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe door to the room they were in opened and the same woman that had spoke to PJ and Phil earlier was peeking her head in. &ldquo;PJ and Phil, we&rsquo;re ready to film part of the background scene you&rsquo;re in. If you want to give me your forms and follow me, we can get you in and out within a few hours.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil wanted to groan. A few hours?! He could have been at home with Spike but instead he had to have Martyn come over and have a play date with Spike because he didn&rsquo;t know how long he was going to be.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe stood up and grabbed the paper and then he followed PJ out of the office. The women directed them to a smaller office on the other side of the floor where there were already people waiting with the cameras and lighting set up.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay, we just need you both to go sit in those chairs and talk. That&rsquo;s literally it. Just keep as calm and relaxed as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nodded and walked over to the chair and PJ followed and sat down as well. The director was sitting in his chair a fair ways away from them and the way the cameras were situated made Phil feel a little bit better because his limited film knowledge gave him the impression they were definitely not the focus of the shot.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnd that became even more clear that they were not the focus of the shot when he caught someone walking to set out of the corner of his eye. And that person was currently speaking to a shorter woman next to him as he walked closer to the director.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDaniel Howell was going to be in this shot too. And he was standing right there on the edge of the set, with his hair perfectly styled and his suit impeccably tailored&#8213;completely wrinkle and spot free. And when he flashed a smile at the director, it was actually blinding.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil snapped out of his stare and turned to PJ. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You were ogling him Phil. Like full on drooling.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Was not.&rdquo; Phil says, settling into the chair and putting his arms over his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe director interrupted them and went over how the scene was going to go and then before they knew it, they were filming and it was happening. It didn&rsquo;t feel too terribly awkward but Phil found it hard to carry on a conversation with PJ in the background while Dan was filming a scene less than ten feet in front of him.</p><p>\tWhen the director yelled cut, a bunch of people immediately ran over to Daniel and began to prod him and redo his hair and makeup although Phil couldn&rsquo;t see where there was any change in what he looked like.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAs he continues to watch and stare at Daniel, Daniel suddenly turns and looks at him. It&rsquo;s a quick glare but it reaches inside of Phil&rsquo;s soul. It&rsquo;s like their eyes met and just sunk into each other.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut then, as if the small glance wasn&rsquo;t enough, Daniel lifted his chin and flashed him a big smile before drawing his lips into a tight line and turning to go back to the makeup artist who was brushing something over his forehead.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Daniel just smiled at me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Never pegged you as a fan girl.&rdquo; PJ joked. &ldquo;Not after all you said about him yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But this was a genuine smile.&rdquo; Phil comments. &ldquo;Like he looked right at me and smiled.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Calm down, mate.&rdquo; PJ laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he smiles at most people. He&rsquo;s not a robot.&rdquo; There was a pause. &ldquo;Besides, how did your mind change so fast after all you said yesterday?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying my mind changed!&rdquo; Phil countered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just merely commenting that he smiled at me and it was&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil, you;re actually going to have an anxiety attack over this. Calm down. It was just a smile.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil huffed but he found himself laughing. PJ was right. It wasn&rsquo;t something to get worked up over.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil doesn&rsquo;t know how many times they called to redo the shoot but he was extremely glad to be done so he could head home. He was dismissed a little later into the afternoon with PJ and they exited the BBC building ready to go back to their flats and take a nap.&nbsp;</p><p><b><a href=\"http://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/post/182167547857/i-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-1\" target=\"_blank\">Last Chapter</a> </b>| <b><strike>Next Chapter&nbsp;</strike></b></p>",
