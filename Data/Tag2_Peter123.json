But when Peter comes in contact with a strange chemical it all goes downhill from there.</i></p><p><i>A few weeks later he&rsquo;s recovering within Avengers Tower.

Come to think of it, its been a pretty shi-crappy, sorry Cap, past few weeks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It all started when Peter and the team, Bucky and Loki included as they were now part of the team, were lounging about in the Avengers living room. He was sprawled across one of the many worn-in leather couches with his head in Loki\u2019s lap and legs in Bucky\u2019s. Tony, his adoptive father, was sat in a loveseat conversing with Bruce who was on the armchair. Natasha was sat criss cross on the floor below Peter. Clint was on the footrest. Thor was on the couch to their left next to Steve, both of whom were comparing Earth\u2019s politics to Asgard\u2019s. Sam was in the connecting kitchen talking to Scott while making hot chocolate. Rhodey was on another couch with Vision, who was cuddling Wanda, all of whom were watching whatever TV program was on. (It was Dance Moms.)</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was a lazy day in SI - Tony ended up not selling the tower after the whole Homecoming fiasco and the team now lived there, but still regularly went to the compound (but don\u2019t tell anyone it was mainly for Peter) - There were no missions, no school, and most importantly, no alien invaders.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter had his eyes closed, nodding off as Loki threaded his hand through his hair and Bucky had his cool metal arm across his legs. Just as he were about to fall asleep, a loud alarm rang throughout the room interrupting the soft chatter, and thoroughly startling the spiderling into a sitting position, at which Loki gave a noise of protest.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Annoyed at the interruption, all present company looked towards the dining table to see a hologram that had popped up saying \u2018INCOMING CALL: EYE PATCH\u201d. Grumbling, Tony gave an exasperated sigh and said, \u201cJARV? Accept please. May as well get it over with.\u201d The hologram then gave-way to a rather, ahem, <i>upset </i>looking Nick Fury.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Glaring, the bald one eyed directer started to talk. \u201cAvengers. We have a HYDRA threat that needs to be neutralized. All the information needed is being sent as we speak. Fury, out.\u201d And with that, Nick Fury ended the call.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving an over-dramatized sigh, Clint threw his head back and stood from the footrest. \u201cAnd here I was, hoping to get absolutely nothing done today.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 So here they were now, at one of the last remaining HYDRA bases. This one was on an offshore island. It was relatively small, and not well guarded. Since it was so small, only a handful of Avengers had to come. Spiderman was to get in, disable the security system, and recover all files. Ironman was more or less back up, but he provided air support. Black Widow was to enter along with Hawkeye after the security system was disabled and takedown any agents. Captain America stood guarding the main exit, also taking down any agents that somehow got outside. (There were none.) Bruce was in the Quinjet on standby for medical purposes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was supposed to be simple, Quick. In and out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 But then everything went to shit.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWebs! Head in through the top window and disable the security.\u201d Tony said through the coms. \u201cCareful, theres electricity two feet below the ceiling. Don\u2019t want a fried bug.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving a fake offended gasp, Peter started to crawl up the side of the brick building. \u201cI am offended! Spiders are arachnids, not bugs!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cJust get in and do the job!\u201d Steve stated, not unkindly, as he just wanted to get the job done. Grumbling, Peter followed the commands and went inside. He immediately felt the buzzing electricity underneath him that was making his senses go crazy.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Alarmed, Peter whispered into the coms, \u201cHey guys, this electricity is making my senses go crazy. Im not gonna be able to detect any incoming danger\u201d. At this, Clint gave a small curse and replied,\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry bug. Tasha and I will be watching you.\u201d Too on edge to correct the archer, Peter started to crawl across the ceiling as flat as he could go. All was silent over the coms as he made his way throughout the base and to the security room. Looking down, or was it up, Peter saw three HYDRA agents below him, manning the computers. Luckily for him, there was no electricity in this room but his senses were still going crazy over it, so he was able to silently drop down behind the agents. Acting fast, he shot his arms to the sides and webbed the two agents on the sided and slammed their heads into the one in the middle. They all went down.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Shaking his arms out and jumping Peter gave a relieved sigh. \u201cPhew! I thought I would never get out of there!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. Now get those security systems down.\u201d Tony commanded, as they had to hurry to attract minimum attention.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cRight! Right.\u201d He darted forward and his finger started flying across the keypads. Only a couple minutes later did he get them down. Throwing his arms up he exclaimed, \u201cThey\u2019re down!\u201d He then started to hack in and retrieve the files.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That was when the chaos started.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A few minutes later as he was distracted, he did not notice the HYDRA agent sneaking up on him from behind until his senses went off at the last moment. He whirled around and was met with a face full of chemicals. Spluttering, he waved his hands around to try and disperse it, but he inevitably breathed it in. When his sight cleared, he saw the agent still in front of him, and quickly incapacitated the man.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSpider-Man! Are you alright?\u201d Natasha\u2019s concerned voice came through his coms. He could hear fighting in the background and assumed that she and Clint were now inside the base.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYe-yeah! Yep, all good. Im on my way right now!\u201d He quickly assured her as he darted out the doorway. Running down the hall, he heard Clint grunt in pain, and right as he turned the corner, saw him stumble a bit, holding a hand to his side as a woman stood in front of him. Jolting forward, Peter ran and threw a fist at the woman, which she quickly parried. They exchanged a few blows before Peter managed to get her feet out from under her and knock her unconscious. Spinning back towards his teammate, he saw Clint with one hand on the stone wall with the other on a quickly reddening spot on his side. Alarmed, Peter ran forward to support him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIm fine!\u201d Clint attempted to protest. \u201cJust a little scratch.\u201d Raising an eyebrow, even though Clint couldn\u2019t see it, and ignored his teammate\u2019s poor protesting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo, Barton, you\u2019re not. Spidey, get him to Bruce.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came over the coms just as he blasted a group of agents. Bobbing his head, Peter slung Clint\u2019s left arm over his shoulders as they made their way out of the base. On their way out, they encountered Natasha battling three agents. Noticing Peter hesitate, torn between getting Clint out or helping Natasha, she quickly shocked him out of his stupor by yelling at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGo! Get him to safety, I\u2019ve got this!\u201d Knowing that she was right and not to protest, he quickly continued making his way out of the base. Approaching the exit, he pushed open the door an was blinded by sunlight. As he blinked to clear his vision, he saw Iron Man flying high in the sky, looking over the base. He hobbled pass Steve and Scott, the former who was waving him towards the jet and the latter shrinking and enlarging, throwing enemy agents all over the place. Giving the captain a nod, he quickly made his way into the woods where the jet was sitting in a clearing. He made it to his destination, seeing the back opened and Bruce running out, slinging Clint\u2019s right arm over his shoulders and putting pressure on the wound with his left hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As they made their way into the jet, Bruce began gathering materials and interrogating both heroes. \u201cHow\u2019d he get injured?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Breathing out, Peter answered as honestly as he could. \u201cNot sure. Wasn\u2019t with him. I only heard him after he was hurt and when I rounded the corner he was holding his side.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAh, I\u2019d say, thirty minutes give or take.\u201d Just as he finished the sentence, Bruce had peeled Clint\u2019s vest off of him, and gave a low whistle.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cStab wound. You\u2019re quite lucky,\u201d the doctor remarked as he quickly cleaned the wound and disinfected it, \u201cany higher, and it could have pierced your lung.\u201d Clint only gave a grunt in return and hissed as he started to stitch it up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re coming in. Base has been cleared out. Spidey, you got those files?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice came over the intercoms.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOh! Yeah! Ye-yep, they\u2019re right uhh, right here!\u201d He quickly raised his hand after patting down his form, having forgotten he\u2019d webbed the flash drive to his hip.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. How bout we blow this popsicle stand, huh?\u201d Tony questioned as he landed in the jet, suit retracting, Natasha and Steve not far behind.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Just as Peter opened his mouth to reply, he was hit with a wave of nausea. Stumbling to the left, Steve quickly caught his arm, brows furrowed. \u201cYou okay son?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYeah I just-\u201c he stopped himself by keeling over and breaking into a fit of coughing. Alarmed, Tony and Natasha rushed over, followed by Bruce who had just finished cleaning Clint\u2019s stab wound up. Ripping off his mask so he could breath better, Peter put his hands on the ground and struggled to take a breath.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cKid! Peter! Whats going on?\u201d Tony asked, quite concerned and worried for his kid. Natasha reached forward, putting her hand on his forehead when the coughing stopped before retracting with a hiss.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s burning up. We need to cool him down, <i>now.\u201d </i>Scott immediately ran to the back of the jet and returned with a cool washcloth, putting it on Peter\u2019s head. Just as he was about to protest that he was fine, when his muscles suddenly locked up and started to spasm.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Tony cried out in alarm as Peter fell to the floor, fall broken by Bruce shoving his hands under his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s having a seizure. Scott! Start timing it. Tony, get us to the tower. Nat, call Cho. Steve, help me move him,\u201d Each hero scrambled to follow his instructions, worried for their youngest member. When Steve got Peter into a better spot, without harming him, Bruce set him on his side so he could breath better, and pulled off his jacket, putting it under Peter\u2019s head so he didn\u2019t cause any head injuries.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As the Quinjet was speeding toward New York, Bruce worriedly looked down at Peter who was still seizing.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cScott. Time.\u201d Scott looked down at his watch and with an alarmed look replied,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFour minutes thirty seven seconds.\u201d This was bad. The seizure didn\u2019t look like it was stopping soon, and if it surpassed five minutes, they were in serious trouble. As soon as Scott\u2019s timer hit five minutes, he alarmed the scientist who then turned towards Tony, who was piloting the jet, and yelled in the most terrified voice any of them had ever heard.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFly faster!\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can post part two if anyone wants more. Idk if anyone\u2019ll see this tho. It\u2019s a little scratchy because I found it in the depths of my computer, having total forgotten about it. I hope it\u2019s okay! Please send me constructive criticism, I love evolving and improving my writing style.</p><p>Thank you!!</p>",

Throwing his arms up he exclaimed, \u201cThey\u2019re down!\u201d He then started to hack in and retrieve the files.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That was when the chaos started.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A few minutes later as he was distracted, he did not notice the HYDRA agent sneaking up on him from behind until his senses went off at the last moment. He whirled around and was met with a face full of chemicals. Spluttering, he waved his hands around to try and disperse it, but he inevitably breathed it in. When his sight cleared, he saw the agent still in front of him, and quickly incapacitated the man.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSpider-Man! Are you alright?\u201d Natasha\u2019s concerned voice came through his coms. He could hear fighting in the background and assumed that she and Clint were now inside the base.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYe-yeah! Yep, all good. Im on my way right now!\u201d He quickly assured her as he darted out the doorway. Running down the hall, he heard Clint grunt in pain, and right as he turned the corner, saw him stumble a bit, holding a hand to his side as a woman stood in front of him. Jolting forward, Peter ran and threw a fist at the woman, which she quickly parried. They exchanged a few blows before Peter managed to get her feet out from under her and knock her unconscious. Spinning back towards his teammate, he saw Clint with one hand on the stone wall with the other on a quickly reddening spot on his side. Alarmed, Peter ran forward to support him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIm fine!\u201d Clint attempted to protest. \u201cJust a little scratch.\u201d Raising an eyebrow, even though Clint couldn\u2019t see it, and ignored his teammate\u2019s poor protesting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo, Barton, you\u2019re not. Spidey, get him to Bruce.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came over the coms just as he blasted a group of agents. Bobbing his head, Peter slung Clint\u2019s left arm over his shoulders as they made their way out of the base. On their way out, they encountered Natasha battling three agents. Noticing Peter hesitate, torn between getting Clint out or helping Natasha, she quickly shocked him out of his stupor by yelling at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGo! Get him to safety, I\u2019ve got this!\u201d Knowing that she was right and not to protest, he quickly continued making his way out of the base. Approaching the exit, he pushed open the door an was blinded by sunlight. As he blinked to clear his vision, he saw Iron Man flying high in the sky, looking over the base. He hobbled pass Steve and Scott, the former who was waving him towards the jet and the latter shrinking and enlarging, throwing enemy agents all over the place. Giving the captain a nod, he quickly made his way into the woods where the jet was sitting in a clearing. He made it to his destination, seeing the back opened and Bruce running out, slinging Clint\u2019s right arm over his shoulders and putting pressure on the wound with his left hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As they made their way into the jet, Bruce began gathering materials and interrogating both heroes. \u201cHow\u2019d he get injured?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Breathing out, Peter answered as honestly as he could. \u201cNot sure. Wasn\u2019t with him. I only heard him after he was hurt and when I rounded the corner he was holding his side.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAh, I\u2019d say, thirty minutes give or take.\u201d Just as he finished the sentence, Bruce had peeled Clint\u2019s vest off of him, and gave a low whistle.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cStab wound. You\u2019re quite lucky,\u201d the doctor remarked as he quickly cleaned the wound and disinfected it, \u201cany higher, and it could have pierced your lung.\u201d Clint only gave a grunt in return and hissed as he started to stitch it up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re coming in. Base has been cleared out. Spidey, you got those files?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice came over the intercoms.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOh! Yeah! Ye-yep, they\u2019re right uhh, right here!\u201d He quickly raised his hand after patting down his form, having forgotten he\u2019d webbed the flash drive to his hip.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. How bout we blow this popsicle stand, huh?\u201d Tony questioned as he landed in the jet, suit retracting, Natasha and Steve not far behind.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Just as Peter opened his mouth to reply, he was hit with a wave of nausea. Stumbling to the left, Steve quickly caught his arm, brows furrowed. \u201cYou okay son?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYeah I just-\u201c he stopped himself by keeling over and breaking into a fit of coughing. Alarmed, Tony and Natasha rushed over, followed by Bruce who had just finished cleaning Clint\u2019s stab wound up. Ripping off his mask so he could breath better, Peter put his hands on the ground and struggled to take a breath.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cKid! Peter! Whats going on?\u201d Tony asked, quite concerned and worried for his kid. Natasha reached forward, putting her hand on his forehead when the coughing stopped before retracting with a hiss.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s burning up. We need to cool him down, <i>now.\u201d </i>Scott immediately ran to the back of the jet and returned with a cool washcloth, putting it on Peter\u2019s head. Just as he was about to protest that he was fine, when his muscles suddenly locked up and started to spasm.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Tony cried out in alarm as Peter fell to the floor, fall broken by Bruce shoving his hands under his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s having a seizure. Scott! Start timing it. Tony, get us to the tower. Nat, call Cho. Steve, help me move him,\u201d Each hero scrambled to follow his instructions, worried for their youngest member. When Steve got Peter into a better spot, without harming him, Bruce set him on his side so he could breath better, and pulled off his jacket, putting it under Peter\u2019s head so he didn\u2019t cause any head injuries.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As the Quinjet was speeding toward New York, Bruce worriedly looked down at Peter who was still seizing.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cScott. Time.\u201d Scott looked down at his watch and with an alarmed look replied,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFour minutes thirty seven seconds.\u201d This was bad. The seizure didn\u2019t look like it was stopping soon, and if it surpassed five minutes, they were in serious trouble. As soon as Scott\u2019s timer hit five minutes, he alarmed the scientist who then turned towards Tony, who was piloting the jet, and yelled in the most terrified voice any of them had ever heard.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFly faster!\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can post part two if anyone wants more. Idk if anyone\u2019ll see this tho. It\u2019s a little scratchy because I found it in the depths of my computer, having total forgotten about it. I hope it\u2019s okay! Please send me constructive criticism, I love evolving and improving my writing style.</p><p>Thank you!!</p>",

But when Peter comes in contact with a strange chemical it all goes downhill from there.</i></p><p><i>A few weeks later he\u2019s recovering within Avengers Tower. Everything\u2019s been going good, so what happens when his decathlon team shows up?</i></p><hr><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter wasn\u2019t really having a great day. Or week. Come to think of it, its been a pretty shi-crappy, sorry Cap, past few weeks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It all started when Peter and the team, Bucky and Loki included as they were now part of the team, were lounging about in the Avengers living room. He was sprawled across one of the many worn-in leather couches with his head in Loki\u2019s lap and legs in Bucky\u2019s. Tony, his adoptive father, was sat in a loveseat conversing with Bruce who was on the armchair. Natasha was sat criss cross on the floor below Peter. Clint was on the footrest. Thor was on the couch to their left next to Steve, both of whom were comparing Earth\u2019s politics to Asgard\u2019s. Sam was in the connecting kitchen talking to Scott while making hot chocolate. Rhodey was on another couch with Vision, who was cuddling Wanda, all of whom were watching whatever TV program was on. (It was Dance Moms.)</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was a lazy day in SI - Tony ended up not selling the tower after the whole Homecoming fiasco and the team now lived there, but still regularly went to the compound (but don\u2019t tell anyone it was mainly for Peter) - There were no missions, no school, and most importantly, no alien invaders.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter had his eyes closed, nodding off as Loki threaded his hand through his hair and Bucky had his cool metal arm across his legs. Just as he were about to fall asleep, a loud alarm rang throughout the room interrupting the soft chatter, and thoroughly startling the spiderling into a sitting position, at which Loki gave a noise of protest.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Annoyed at the interruption, all present company looked towards the dining table to see a hologram that had popped up saying \u2018INCOMING CALL: EYE PATCH\u201d. Grumbling, Tony gave an exasperated sigh and said, \u201cJARV? Accept please. May as well get it over with.\u201d The hologram then gave-way to a rather, ahem, <i>upset </i>looking Nick Fury.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Glaring, the bald one eyed directer started to talk. \u201cAvengers. We have a HYDRA threat that needs to be neutralized. All the information needed is being sent as we speak. Fury, out.\u201d And with that, Nick Fury ended the call.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving an over-dramatized sigh, Clint threw his head back and stood from the footrest. \u201cAnd here I was, hoping to get absolutely nothing done today.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 So here they were now, at one of the last remaining HYDRA bases. This one was on an offshore island. It was relatively small, and not well guarded. Since it was so small, only a handful of Avengers had to come. Spiderman was to get in, disable the security system, and recover all files. Ironman was more or less back up, but he provided air support. Black Widow was to enter along with Hawkeye after the security system was disabled and takedown any agents. Captain America stood guarding the main exit, also taking down any agents that somehow got outside. (There were none.) Bruce was in the Quinjet on standby for medical purposes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was supposed to be simple, Quick. In and out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 But then everything went to shit.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWebs! Head in through the top window and disable the security.\u201d Tony said through the coms. \u201cCareful, theres electricity two feet below the ceiling. Don\u2019t want a fried bug.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving a fake offended gasp, Peter started to crawl up the side of the brick building. \u201cI am offended! Spiders are arachnids, not bugs!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cJust get in and do the job!\u201d Steve stated, not unkindly, as he just wanted to get the job done. Grumbling, Peter followed the commands and went inside. He immediately felt the buzzing electricity underneath him that was making his senses go crazy.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Alarmed, Peter whispered into the coms, \u201cHey guys, this electricity is making my senses go crazy. Im not gonna be able to detect any incoming danger\u201d. At this, Clint gave a small curse and replied,\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry bug. Tasha and I will be watching you.\u201d Too on edge to correct the archer, Peter started to crawl across the ceiling as flat as he could go. All was silent over the coms as he made his way throughout the base and to the security room. Looking down, or was it up, Peter saw three HYDRA agents below him, manning the computers. Luckily for him, there was no electricity in this room but his senses were still going crazy over it, so he was able to silently drop down behind the agents. Acting fast, he shot his arms to the sides and webbed the two agents on the sided and slammed their heads into the one in the middle. They all went down.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Shaking his arms out and jumping Peter gave a relieved sigh. \u201cPhew! I thought I would never get out of there!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGood job kid. Now get those security systems down.\u201d Tony commanded, as they had to hurry to attract minimum attention.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cRight! Right.\u201d He darted forward and his finger started flying across the keypads. Only a couple minutes later did he get them down. Throwing his arms up he exclaimed, \u201cThey\u2019re down!\u201d He then started to hack in and retrieve the files.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That was when the chaos started.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A few minutes later as he was distracted, he did not notice the HYDRA agent sneaking up on him from behind until his senses went off at the last moment. He whirled around and was met with a face full of chemicals. Spluttering, he waved his hands around to try and disperse it, but he inevitably breathed it in. When his sight cleared, he saw the agent still in front of him, and quickly incapacitated the man.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSpider-Man! Are you alright?\u201d Natasha\u2019s concerned voice came through his coms. He could hear fighting in the background and assumed that she and Clint were now inside the base.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYe-yeah! Yep, all good.

Alarmed, Peter ran forward to support him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIm fine!\u201d Clint attempted to protest. \u201cJust a little scratch.\u201d Raising an eyebrow, even though Clint couldn\u2019t see it, and ignored his teammate\u2019s poor protesting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo, Barton, you\u2019re not.

Approaching the exit, he pushed open the door an was blinded by sunlight. As he blinked to clear his vision, he saw Iron Man flying high in the sky, looking over the base. He hobbled pass Steve and Scott, the former who was waving him towards the jet and the latter shrinking and enlarging, throwing enemy agents all over the place. Giving the captain a nod, he quickly made his way into the woods where the jet was sitting in a clearing. He made it to his destination, seeing the back opened and Bruce running out, slinging Clint\u2019s right arm over his shoulders and putting pressure on the wound with his left hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As they made their way into the jet, Bruce began gathering materials and interrogating both heroes. \u201cHow\u2019d he get injured?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Breathing out, Peter answered as honestly as he could. \u201cNot sure. Wasn\u2019t with him.

Come to think of it, its been a pretty shi-crappy, sorry Cap, past few weeks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It all started when Peter and the team, Bucky and Loki included as they were now part of the team, were lounging about in the Avengers living room. He was sprawled across one of the many worn-in leather couches with his head in Loki&rsquo;s lap and legs in Bucky&rsquo;s. Tony, his adoptive father, was sat in a loveseat conversing with Bruce who was on the armchair. Natasha was sat criss cross on the floor below Peter. Clint was on the footrest. Thor was on the couch to their left next to Steve, both of whom were comparing Earth&rsquo;s politics to Asgard&rsquo;s. Sam was in the connecting kitchen talking to Scott while making hot chocolate. Rhodey was on another couch with Vision, who was cuddling Wanda, all of whom were watching whatever TV program was on. (It was Dance Moms.)</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a lazy day in SI - Tony ended up not selling the tower after the whole Homecoming fiasco and the team now lived there, but still regularly went to the compound (but don&rsquo;t tell anyone it was mainly for Peter) - There were no missions, no school, and most importantly, no alien invaders.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Peter had his eyes closed, nodding off as Loki threaded his hand through his hair and Bucky had his cool metal arm across his legs. Just as he were about to fall asleep, a loud alarm rang throughout the room interrupting the soft chatter, and thoroughly startling the spiderling into a sitting position, at which Loki gave a noise of protest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Annoyed at the interruption, all present company looked towards the dining table to see a hologram that had popped up saying &lsquo;INCOMING CALL: EYE PATCH&rdquo;. Grumbling, Tony gave an exasperated sigh and said, &ldquo;JARV? Accept please. May as well get it over with.&rdquo; The hologram then gave-way to a rather, ahem, <i>upset </i>looking Nick Fury.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Glaring, the bald one eyed directer started to talk. &ldquo;Avengers. We have a HYDRA threat that needs to be neutralized. All the information needed is being sent as we speak. Fury, out.&rdquo; And with that, Nick Fury ended the call.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Giving an over-dramatized sigh, Clint threw his head back and stood from the footrest. &ldquo;And here I was, hoping to get absolutely nothing done today.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; So here they were now, at one of the last remaining HYDRA bases. This one was on an offshore island. It was relatively small, and not well guarded. Since it was so small, only a handful of Avengers had to come. Spiderman was to get in, disable the security system, and recover all files. Ironman was more or less back up, but he provided air support. Black Widow was to enter along with Hawkeye after the security system was disabled and takedown any agents. Captain America stood guarding the main exit, also taking down any agents that somehow got outside. (There were none.) Bruce was in the Quinjet on standby for medical purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was supposed to be simple, Quick. In and out.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But then everything went to shit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Webs! Head in through the top window and disable the security.&rdquo; Tony said through the coms. &ldquo;Careful, theres electricity two feet below the ceiling. Don&rsquo;t want a fried bug.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Giving a fake offended gasp, Peter started to crawl up the side of the brick building. &ldquo;I am offended! Spiders are arachnids, not bugs!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Just get in and do the job!&rdquo; Steve stated, not unkindly, as he just wanted to get the job done. Grumbling, Peter followed the commands and went inside. He immediately felt the buzzing electricity underneath him that was making his senses go crazy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Alarmed, Peter whispered into the coms, &ldquo;Hey guys, this electricity is making my senses go crazy. Im not gonna be able to detect any incoming danger&rdquo;. At this, Clint gave a small curse and replied,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry bug. Tasha and I will be watching you.&rdquo; Too on edge to correct the archer, Peter started to crawl across the ceiling as flat as he could go. All was silent over the coms as he made his way throughout the base and to the security room. Looking down, or was it up, Peter saw three HYDRA agents below him, manning the computers. Luckily for him, there was no electricity in this room but his senses were still going crazy over it, so he was able to silently drop down behind the agents. Acting fast, he shot his arms to the sides and webbed the two agents on the sided and slammed their heads into the one in the middle. They all went down.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Shaking his arms out and jumping Peter gave a relieved sigh. &ldquo;Phew! I thought I would never get out of there!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Good job kid. Now get those security systems down.&rdquo; Tony commanded, as they had to hurry to attract minimum attention.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Right! Right.&rdquo; He darted forward and his finger started flying across the keypads. Only a couple minutes later did he get them down. Throwing his arms up he exclaimed, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re down!&rdquo; He then started to hack in and retrieve the files.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That was when the chaos started.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A few minutes later as he was distracted, he did not notice the HYDRA agent sneaking up on him from behind until his senses went off at the last moment. He whirled around and was met with a face full of chemicals. Spluttering, he waved his hands around to try and disperse it, but he inevitably breathed it in. When his sight cleared, he saw the agent still in front of him, and quickly incapacitated the man.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Spider-Man! Are you alright?&rdquo; Natasha&rsquo;s concerned voice came through his coms. He could hear fighting in the background and assumed that she and Clint were now inside the base.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Ye-yeah! Yep, all good. Im on my way right now!&rdquo; He quickly assured her as he darted out the doorway. Running down the hall, he heard Clint grunt in pain, and right as he turned the corner, saw him stumble a bit, holding a hand to his side as a woman stood in front of him. Jolting forward, Peter ran and threw a fist at the woman, which she quickly parried. They exchanged a few blows before Peter managed to get her feet out from under her and knock her unconscious. Spinning back towards his teammate, he saw Clint with one hand on the stone wall with the other on a quickly reddening spot on his side. Alarmed, Peter ran forward to support him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Im fine!&rdquo; Clint attempted to protest. &ldquo;Just a little scratch.&rdquo; Raising an eyebrow, even though Clint couldn&rsquo;t see it, and ignored his teammate&rsquo;s poor protesting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;No, Barton, you&rsquo;re not. Spidey, get him to Bruce.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice came over the coms just as he blasted a group of agents. Bobbing his head, Peter slung Clint&rsquo;s left arm over his shoulders as they made their way out of the base. On their way out, they encountered Natasha battling three agents. Noticing Peter hesitate, torn between getting Clint out or helping Natasha, she quickly shocked him out of his stupor by yelling at him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Go! Get him to safety, I&rsquo;ve got this!&rdquo; Knowing that she was right and not to protest, he quickly continued making his way out of the base. Approaching the exit, he pushed open the door an was blinded by sunlight. As he blinked to clear his vision, he saw Iron Man flying high in the sky, looking over the base. He hobbled pass Steve and Scott, the former who was waving him towards the jet and the latter shrinking and enlarging, throwing enemy agents all over the place. Giving the captain a nod, he quickly made his way into the woods where the jet was sitting in a clearing. He made it to his destination, seeing the back opened and Bruce running out, slinging Clint&rsquo;s right arm over his shoulders and putting pressure on the wound with his left hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As they made their way into the jet, Bruce began gathering materials and interrogating both heroes. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d he get injured?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Breathing out, Peter answered as honestly as he could. &ldquo;Not sure. Wasn&rsquo;t with him. I only heard him after he was hurt and when I rounded the corner he was holding his side.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;How long ago?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;d say, thirty minutes give or take.&rdquo; Just as he finished the sentence, Bruce had peeled Clint&rsquo;s vest off of him, and gave a low whistle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Stab wound. You&rsquo;re quite lucky,&rdquo; the doctor remarked as he quickly cleaned the wound and disinfected it, &ldquo;any higher, and it could have pierced your lung.&rdquo; Clint only gave a grunt in return and hissed as he started to stitch it up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming in. Base has been cleared out. Spidey, you got those files?&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice came over the intercoms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! Yeah! Ye-yep, they&rsquo;re right uhh, right here!&rdquo; He quickly raised his hand after patting down his form, having forgotten he&rsquo;d webbed the flash drive to his hip.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Good job kid. How bout we blow this popsicle stand, huh?&rdquo; Tony questioned as he landed in the jet, suit retracting, Natasha and Steve not far behind.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as Peter opened his mouth to reply, he was hit with a wave of nausea. Stumbling to the left, Steve quickly caught his arm, brows furrowed. &ldquo;You okay son?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah I just-&ldquo; he stopped himself by keeling over and breaking into a fit of coughing. Alarmed, Tony and Natasha rushed over, followed by Bruce who had just finished cleaning Clint&rsquo;s stab wound up. Ripping off his mask so he could breath better, Peter put his hands on the ground and struggled to take a breath.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Kid! Peter! Whats going on?&rdquo; Tony asked, quite concerned and worried for his kid. Natasha reached forward, putting her hand on his forehead when the coughing stopped before retracting with a hiss.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s burning up. We need to cool him down, <i>now.&rdquo; </i>Scott immediately ran to the back of the jet and returned with a cool washcloth, putting it on Peter&rsquo;s head. Just as he was about to protest that he was fine, when his muscles suddenly locked up and started to spasm.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Tony cried out in alarm as Peter fell to the floor, fall broken by Bruce shoving his hands under his head.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s having a seizure. Scott! Start timing it. Tony, get us to the tower. Nat, call Cho. Steve, help me move him,&rdquo; Each hero scrambled to follow his instructions, worried for their youngest member.

Right now, you were enjoying one of them, enjoying the view from the top of Stark Tower as you curled up with a book, basking in the summer heat and feeling the light breeze through your hair.</p><p>It was the first time you\u2019d had the opportunity to read your book all week, and you were loving the silence this time alone brought you. Your dad had just gotten home from a long mission, and refused to leave you alone for more than two seconds all week. But you had woken this morning to find a note on the counter, explaining how he had to leave on urgent business in the middle of the night. </p><p>After years of impromptu Avengers missions, you knew the drill. He\u2019d be back when he\u2019d be back, and for now, the penthouse suite of Stark Tower was yours to do whatever you wanted. </p><p>And right now, that meant a quiet morning with your book. The silence was so unbelievable that you almost didn\u2019t bat an eye when you heard someone clear their throat behind you. Almost. </p><p>Knowing your father wouldn\u2019t be home anytime soon, your first instinct was to freeze, the book in your hands no longer holding your interest. But the voice that came next belonged to a teenage boy. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you know where Tony Stark is?\u201d you heard, and you spun around in your seat to find a boy around your age, wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a cheesy pun about periodic tables. </p><p>Frowning, you stood up from your seat. \u201cWho are you, and what are you doing in my house?\u201d</p><p>The boy flushed, shifting his weight as he looked at you apologetically. \u201cSorry, I know this is Mr. Stark\u2019s private penthouse, but I was supposed to meet him today, and Happy told me he might be up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out,\u201d you replied, still intrigued by the stranger across from you. </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re his\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d you answered, crossing your arms. \u201cWhy are you meeting with my dad?\u201d</p><p>The kid shifted again, very obviously uncomfortable. \u201cI-I\u2019m&hellip;an intern. I work with your father?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t need the boy\u2019s horrible lying abilities to know that your father didn\u2019t have any teenage interns working for his company. Not any that were allowed to come up to his penthouse suite to have a chat with him, anyway. But it took you a few seconds to register what that meant. A teenage boy, in the city, who came to have meetings with your father? </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Spiderman!\u201d You said, finally coming to the realization. The boy went pale, shaking his head. You rolled your eyes. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not gonna rat you out or anything. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be able to lie your way out of it; you\u2019ve already proven yourself to be pretty horrible at that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sheepishly, but held out his hand. \u201cPeter Parker,\u201d he said, and you shook his hand. </p><p>\u201cY/N. Y/N Stark,\u201d you added, \u201cbut it seems like you already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, y/n,\u201d Peter said, \u201cI guess I should leave to your book. It was nice meeting you!\u201d He smiled kindly, waving awkwardly as he turned around. </p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d you yelled, and then smiled, composing yourself as he turned back towards you. \u201cYou should stay. My dad might be home soon, and if he was asking to meet with you, I\u2019m sure it was important.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude,\u201d Peter said, motioning to your setup on the chair. </p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not intruding on anything. Sit down,\u201d you said, motioning to the other chairs around you, slumping back into your own seat. Peter took a seat, but he looked hesitant, perched uncomfortably on the edge of his chair. </p><p>You ignored this and returned to gazing at the skyline. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice view, huh?\u201d you asked. </p><p>Peter let out a breath you didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been holding in, settling into his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks so distant, though. I mean, I know we\u2019re right in the middle of it, but it feels like there\u2019s a glass wall between us and the city.\u201d You looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cWhat would happen if you jumped off the building right now?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, since I\u2019m not wearing my suit, I would most likely fall to my death.\u201d You snorted. </p><p>\u201cBut if you were wearing it. You\u2019d just fly.\u201d You sighed. \u201cSounds freeing.\u201d The next few moments passed in silence, and you glanced at Peter, who looked unsure of what to say. You decided to change the subject. \u201cSo, you\u2019re in high school, right? Where do you go to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidtown School of Science and Technology,\u201d Peter recited. You nodded, recognizing the name as a well known STEM school in the city. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cI\u2019m homeschooled. When my dad has time, he teaches me, but I have some tutors both online and that come here sometimes. I don\u2019t leave the tower very much. Does it show?\u201d You teased, laughing. </p><p>He laughed too, but he shook his head. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you meeting my father, Spiderman? I heard you\u2019d given up your Avenger\u2019s position to stay local.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark likes me to check in every once in awhile,\u201d Peter answered. \u201cHe makes adjustments to my suit too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d you asked curiously. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like your dad, or any of the Avengers. I\u2019m Peter Parker, I\u2019m no one, and my talents are better served as a friendly neighborhood Spiderman than someone who saves the world.\u201d He looked down at his lap. \u201cIt was cowardly, I guess.\u201d You frowned. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s noble.\u201d Peter looked up. You were about to go into a speech about how helping the little guy was just as important as saving the world when Peter stood up abruptly. </p><p>\u201cI really should go. Mr. Stark\u2019s not going to be here anytime soon, is he?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201cProbably not,\u201d you answered honestly. </p><p>Peter nodded, heading towards the door. \u201cIt was nice talking to you,\u201d he said, smiling kindly. He looked like a puppy dog, and his soft brown eyes made you smile. </p><p>\u201cIs it alright if I text you?\u201d you asked, surprising yourself, and Peter it seemed, who flushed red quicker than you imagined possible. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of friends my age, you know, with the homeschooling and everything,\u201d you explained. Peter nodded his head, and you swore you saw a smile on his face. You stood up quickly, pulling your phone from your pocket. You already had a new text message opened by the time you made it to Peter. You handed him your phone, and he typed in a number. When you got the phone back, you typed a quick \u201csup\u201d with the peace sign emoji, and sent it. It took seconds for Peter\u2019s phone to buzz, his screen lighting up as he added you to his contacts as well. </p><p>Peter looked up from his phone, looking as if he wanted to say something, but then he bit his lip and said, \u201cSee you around, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You smiled. \u201cSee you around, Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>When your father got home later that evening, you told him about Peter\u2019s visit.</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter,\u201d Tony said, scratching his face. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s this new intern at Stark Industries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know he\u2019s Spiderman, dad,\u201d you said, rolling your eyes. \u201cBut thanks for your trust in me.\u201d</p><p>Tony winked at you. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out? Did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. What kind of teenage intern would be allowed to visit you in your penthouse suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow was your mission?\u201d you asked curiously. </p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not allowed to disclose details,\u201d Tony said, waving you off. </p><p>\u201cPretty please?\u201d you asked, batting your eyes. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll just hack into your mission files tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>You raised your eyebrows. \u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You decided to send Peter a text for the first time the next morning. Tony was making waffles, and you were tasting the batter as you balanced a calculus textbook on your lap. </p><p>Tony was rambling on about the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which you had neglected to tell him was the subject of the week before\u2019s lesson with your tutor Mrs. Greene. Your phone was unlocked, sitting on the textbook, and you pulled up Peter\u2019s contact info, biting your lip as you debated tapping the message button. Taking a deep breath, you clicked on it, and your heartbeat sped up as the text message opened. </p><p>You settled on a cute Spiderman meme, a little teasing in nature, and hit send before you had the chance to talk yourself out of it. </p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re ignoring me,\u201d Tony huffed dramatically. He set a waffle on your plate, pouting like a child. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d you said, grinning as you took a big bite. </p><p>Tony sighed. \u201cJust do your homework, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>The rest of your breakfast was in silence as Tony continued piling waffles on your plate as you worked your way through advanced calculus problems. When you felt a light buzz on your lap, you almost jumped in your seat. </p><p>Peter\u2019s response was a quick gif of your dad with the caption \u201cI AM IRON MAN\u201d. You giggled lightly, sending a quick response before you locked your phone again. </p><p>\u201cWhat so funny?\u201d Tony asked, leaning over the counter. \u201cCertainly not the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?\u201d</p><p>You laughed again. \u201cApparently they\u2019re making memes about you, Dad.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s making memes about me?\u201d You shrugged, laughing harder at his expression. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s it.\u201d He grabbed your plate, despite your protests. \u201cGo to your room. Maybe you can focus better in there.\u201d</p><p>But it didn\u2019t really improve your focus as much as your father had hoped. On your way back to your bedroom, you texted Peter again. <i>Great, you got me in trouble with my dad. Way to go. </i>\ud83d\ude44</p><p><i>Sorry :(</i></p><p>When arrived at your room, you threw the calculus book on the floor, forgotten, as you climbed onto your bed. </p><p><i>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s upset or ecstatic that he\u2019s essentially a walking meme. </i></p><p><i>Ecstatic. For sure. </i></p><p>Over the course of the next few weeks, you and Peter became close friends over text. Despite never seeing each other in person, you held conversations over text message past midnight every night, fell asleep to each other\u2019s voices on the phone, and were the first to say good morning the next day. </p><p>You awoke one Saturday morning to a couple of text tones coming from the nightstand beside your bed. You pulled it towards you, unlocking it as you blinked sleepily. Unable to read the messages on the bright screen, you decided to call Peter. He picked up on the first ring. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna do something today?\u201d You asked in between a yawn. When the other end was silent for a couple of moments, you felt your heartbeat quicken, worried you had crossed a line. You and Peter had not met in person since the day you had met, a little over a month ago. You sat up in your bed, waking up quickly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re busy. Sorry, I totally understand if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter interrupted, \u201cno no no no no!\u201d You laughed a little as his insistence. \u201cI\u2019d love to. It\u2019s just,\u201d he sighed, \u201cthe Homecoming dance is tonight, and I promised Aunt May I\u2019d let her help me get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, Homecoming. Sounds fun! Got a hot date?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cYeah, no. I wouldn\u2019t go at all if Ned hadn\u2019t insisted I come. But he got a date, asked her just yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Peter,\u201d you teased. \u201cAt the dance all by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll just hide in the bathroom the whole time.\u201d</p><p>You laughed. \u201cI have a feeling that\u2019s what I\u2019d do during a school dance, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Peter said, coming to a realization. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been to a school dance.\u201d He said it rather than asked it, but you felt yourself nod, even though he wouldn\u2019t be able to see. You felt your heart thudding in your chest. \u201cWould you like to go to one?\u201d His voice was small, as if he was nervous. </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun, Pete,\u201d you said, surprised you were able to form complete sentences. Nervous excitement fluttered through your veins, and you felt your cheeks flush as you heard Peter\u2019s \u201cAwesome!\u201d</p><p>You thought your dad would\u2019ve been mad hearing that you\u2019d made plans without asking him, but as you soon understood, to Tony Stark, Peter was about the least dangerous person his child could be spending their time with. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for your father to buy you an outfit to be brought to Stark Tower. What took a long time was the hour after you had finished getting ready, just following dinner that night, when you had to wait for Peter to arrive. Your father had refused to let you wait downstairs, so you had to stand outside the elevator door, waiting for the light to flash and the doors to open. </p><p>You were drumming your fingers on your knee when you heard the ping. Standing up and straightening out your clothes, you took a deep breath. </p><p>But when the doors opened, it was simply Happy, with a light smile on his face, his eyebrows raised at your not-so-friendly glare. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were Peter,\u201d you mumbled, sighing. Happy chuckled. </p><p>\u201cGood to see you too, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Happy?\u201d you asked, your hand returning to your knee, where it continued to tap anxiously. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good actually,\u201d Happy said. \u201cThe company\u2019s doing well, your dad\u2019s been off my back-\u201d The elevator pinged again, and you jumped to your feet, ignoring Happy as you met eyes Peter through the slowly opening elevator doors. </p><p>He looked gorgeous. You had forgotten just how gorgeous he was. His black suit fit him perfectly, and his puppy dog eyes lit up when they saw you. \u201cY/N\u2026\u201d Peter said quietly, his voice fading out. You felt a flutter of butterflies in your stomach, your cheeks heating up from his gaze. And then Tony Stark stepped in front of you, blocking your view. </p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony acknowledged. </p><p>\u201cMr-Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter stuttered. \u201cHow&hellip;How\u2019s it going?\u201d His voice sounded small as Tony put an arm around his shoulder and ushered him into the apartment. </p><p>\u201cWonderful, Peter. Just wonderful.\u201d You saw Peter flinch at the tight grip your father had on his arm. You rolled your eyes. </p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d you said, your voice firm. Your dad looked at you then, an innocent look on his face. </p><p>\u201cWhat, y/n? I just want to give your friend Pete a little talk.\u201d You gave Peter an apologetic glance, but you figured he\u2019d handle it fine; Tony wasn\u2019t as scary as he liked to think he was. </p><p>After Peter\u2019s face went pale from Tony\u2019s threats, the two of you stood by the elevator door, wishing Happy and Tony a good night. When the elevator doors finally closed, you both let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d you said, a grin on your face. Peter laughed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I think your dad likes me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think he does too. He\u2019s not good at admitting stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for the dance?\u201d Peter asked, glancing over at you. He still seemed nervous, and you could feel the butterflies still fluttering around your stomach. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you answered honestly, chuckling softly. \u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d </p><p>Your heart jumped when you felt Peter\u2019s cool hands over your own. You looked at him, your breathing uneven. And then, before giving yourself the chance to change your mind, you pressed the stop button on the elevator, trapping the car between floors. </p><p>\u201cWha-\u201d Peter started to ask, but you interrupted them. </p><p>\u201cBefore we get there,\u201d you took a deep breath to steady yourself. \u201cI just wanted to tell you&hellip;I really like you Pete, and I know you probably just asked me to this dance as a friend, but I just thought you should know.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes widened, but he looked at a loss for words. Your heart was pounding, cheeks flushed in nervous embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said as he stayed silent. You unwound your hand from his, the butterflies quickly turning into nausea. You felt tears well in your eyes as you desperately wished you hadn\u2019t said anything at all. </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter said, grabbing your wrist and pulling you closer. Up close, you could see the pink tinting his cheeks, and you were sure he could feel your heartbeat from where his fingers gripped your wrist. \u201cI&hellip;I didn\u2019t invite you as more than a friend. I\u2026\u201d But you had gotten all the confirmation you needed. </p><p>You raised your free hand to cup his cheek, and leaned in the remaining distance. It was awkward at first, and your noses bumped together uncomfortably, but Peter wound his other arm around your waist, and you felt warm in all the places you were touching: your fingers on his cheek, his hand on your back, and his cool fingers wrapped around your wrist. When you pulled away (too soon in your opinion), you were both out of breath. You smiled up at Peter, your eyes opening slowly to meet his puppy dog ones. The moment would have been perfect, had it not been for the robotic voice that came on through the elevator\u2019s intercom system. </p><p>\u201cY/N Stark,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y. said. You groaned, already knowing what this was about. \u201cYour father would like to ask you to stop making out with your boyfriend long enough to resume the elevator functioning. All deliveries to the upper floors are being blocked.\u201d Your face grew hot, and you buried it in Peter\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cCameras,\u201d you mumbled. Peter pressed the button to start the elevator again, but you suspected his cheeks were as red as yours. \u201cMy dad\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d</p>",

Right now, you were enjoying one of them, enjoying the view from the top of Stark Tower as you curled up with a book, basking in the summer heat and feeling the light breeze through your hair.</p><p>It was the first time you\u2019d had the opportunity to read your book all week, and you were loving the silence this time alone brought you. Your dad had just gotten home from a long mission, and refused to leave you alone for more than two seconds all week. But you had woken this morning to find a note on the counter, explaining how he had to leave on urgent business in the middle of the night. </p><p>After years of impromptu Avengers missions, you knew the drill. He\u2019d be back when he\u2019d be back, and for now, the penthouse suite of Stark Tower was yours to do whatever you wanted. </p><p>And right now, that meant a quiet morning with your book. The silence was so unbelievable that you almost didn\u2019t bat an eye when you heard someone clear their throat behind you. Almost. </p><p>Knowing your father wouldn\u2019t be home anytime soon, your first instinct was to freeze, the book in your hands no longer holding your interest. But the voice that came next belonged to a teenage boy. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you know where Tony Stark is?\u201d you heard, and you spun around in your seat to find a boy around your age, wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a cheesy pun about periodic tables. </p><p>Frowning, you stood up from your seat. \u201cWho are you, and what are you doing in my house?\u201d</p><p>The boy flushed, shifting his weight as he looked at you apologetically. \u201cSorry, I know this is Mr. Stark\u2019s private penthouse, but I was supposed to meet him today, and Happy told me he might be up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out,\u201d you replied, still intrigued by the stranger across from you. </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re his\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d you answered, crossing your arms. \u201cWhy are you meeting with my dad?\u201d</p><p>The kid shifted again, very obviously uncomfortable. \u201cI-I\u2019m\u2026an intern. I work with your father?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t need the boy\u2019s horrible lying abilities to know that your father didn\u2019t have any teenage interns working for his company. Not any that were allowed to come up to his penthouse suite to have a chat with him, anyway. But it took you a few seconds to register what that meant. A teenage boy, in the city, who came to have meetings with your father? </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Spiderman!\u201d You said, finally coming to the realization. The boy went pale, shaking his head. You rolled your eyes. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not gonna rat you out or anything. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be able to lie your way out of it; you\u2019ve already proven yourself to be pretty horrible at that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sheepishly, but held out his hand. \u201cPeter Parker,\u201d he said, and you shook his hand. </p><p>\u201cY/N. Y/N Stark,\u201d you added, \u201cbut it seems like you already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, y/n,\u201d Peter said, \u201cI guess I should leave to your book. It was nice meeting you!\u201d He smiled kindly, waving awkwardly as he turned around. </p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d you yelled, and then smiled, composing yourself as he turned back towards you. \u201cYou should stay. My dad might be home soon, and if he was asking to meet with you, I\u2019m sure it was important.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude,\u201d Peter said, motioning to your setup on the chair. </p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not intruding on anything. Sit down,\u201d you said, motioning to the other chairs around you, slumping back into your own seat. Peter took a seat, but he looked hesitant, perched uncomfortably on the edge of his chair. </p><p>You ignored this and returned to gazing at the skyline. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice view, huh?\u201d you asked. </p><p>Peter let out a breath you didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been holding in, settling into his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks so distant, though. I mean, I know we\u2019re right in the middle of it, but it feels like there\u2019s a glass wall between us and the city.\u201d You looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cWhat would happen if you jumped off the building right now?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, since I\u2019m not wearing my suit, I would most likely fall to my death.\u201d You snorted. </p><p>\u201cBut if you were wearing it. You\u2019d just fly.\u201d You sighed. \u201cSounds freeing.\u201d The next few moments passed in silence, and you glanced at Peter, who looked unsure of what to say. You decided to change the subject. \u201cSo, you\u2019re in high school, right? Where do you go to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidtown School of Science and Technology,\u201d Peter recited. You nodded, recognizing the name as a well known STEM school in the city. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cI\u2019m homeschooled. When my dad has time, he teaches me, but I have some tutors both online and that come here sometimes. I don\u2019t leave the tower very much. Does it show?\u201d You teased, laughing. </p><p>He laughed too, but he shook his head. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you meeting my father, Spiderman? I heard you\u2019d given up your Avenger\u2019s position to stay local.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark likes me to check in every once in awhile,\u201d Peter answered. \u201cHe makes adjustments to my suit too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d you asked curiously. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like your dad, or any of the Avengers. I\u2019m Peter Parker, I\u2019m no one, and my talents are better served as a friendly neighborhood Spiderman than someone who saves the world.\u201d He looked down at his lap. \u201cIt was cowardly, I guess.\u201d You frowned. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s noble.\u201d Peter looked up. You were about to go into a speech about how helping the little guy was just as important as saving the world when Peter stood up abruptly. </p><p>\u201cI really should go. Mr. Stark\u2019s not going to be here anytime soon, is he?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201cProbably not,\u201d you answered honestly. </p><p>Peter nodded, heading towards the door. \u201cIt was nice talking to you,\u201d he said, smiling kindly. He looked like a puppy dog, and his soft brown eyes made you smile. </p><p>\u201cIs it alright if I text you?\u201d you asked, surprising yourself, and Peter it seemed, who flushed red quicker than you imagined possible. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of friends my age, you know, with the homeschooling and everything,\u201d you explained. Peter nodded his head, and you swore you saw a smile on his face. You stood up quickly, pulling your phone from your pocket. You already had a new text message opened by the time you made it to Peter. You handed him your phone, and he typed in a number. When you got the phone back, you typed a quick \u201csup\u201d with the peace sign emoji, and sent it. It took seconds for Peter\u2019s phone to buzz, his screen lighting up as he added you to his contacts as well. </p><p>Peter looked up from his phone, looking as if he wanted to say something, but then he bit his lip and said, \u201cSee you around, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You smiled. \u201cSee you around, Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>When your father got home later that evening, you told him about Peter\u2019s visit.</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter,\u201d Tony said, scratching his face. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s this new intern at Stark Industries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know he\u2019s Spiderman, dad,\u201d you said, rolling your eyes. \u201cBut thanks for your trust in me.\u201d</p><p>Tony winked at you. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out? Did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. What kind of teenage intern would be allowed to visit you in your penthouse suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow was your mission?\u201d you asked curiously. </p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not allowed to disclose details,\u201d Tony said, waving you off. </p><p>\u201cPretty please?\u201d you asked, batting your eyes. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll just hack into your mission files tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>You raised your eyebrows. \u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You decided to send Peter a text for the first time the next morning. Tony was making waffles, and you were tasting the batter as you balanced a calculus textbook on your lap. </p><p>Tony was rambling on about the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which you had neglected to tell him was the subject of the week before\u2019s lesson with your tutor Mrs. Greene. Your phone was unlocked, sitting on the textbook, and you pulled up Peter\u2019s contact info, biting your lip as you debated tapping the message button. Taking a deep breath, you clicked on it, and your heartbeat sped up as the text message opened. </p><p>You settled on a cute Spiderman meme, a little teasing in nature, and hit send before you had the chance to talk yourself out of it. </p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re ignoring me,\u201d Tony huffed dramatically. He set a waffle on your plate, pouting like a child. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d you said, grinning as you took a big bite. </p><p>Tony sighed. \u201cJust do your homework, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>The rest of your breakfast was in silence as Tony continued piling waffles on your plate as you worked your way through advanced calculus problems. When you felt a light buzz on your lap, you almost jumped in your seat. </p><p>Peter\u2019s response was a quick gif of your dad with the caption \u201cI AM IRON MAN\u201d. You giggled lightly, sending a quick response before you locked your phone again. </p><p>\u201cWhat so funny?\u201d Tony asked, leaning over the counter. \u201cCertainly not the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?\u201d</p><p>You laughed again. \u201cApparently they\u2019re making memes about you, Dad.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s making memes about me?\u201d You shrugged, laughing harder at his expression. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s it.\u201d He grabbed your plate, despite your protests. \u201cGo to your room. Maybe you can focus better in there.\u201d</p><p>But it didn\u2019t really improve your focus as much as your father had hoped. On your way back to your bedroom, you texted Peter again. <i>Great, you got me in trouble with my dad. Way to go. </i>\ud83d\ude44</p><p><i>Sorry :(</i></p><p>When arrived at your room, you threw the calculus book on the floor, forgotten, as you climbed onto your bed. </p><p><i>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s upset or ecstatic that he\u2019s essentially a walking meme. </i></p><p><i>Ecstatic. For sure. </i></p><p>Over the course of the next few weeks, you and Peter became close friends over text. Despite never seeing each other in person, you held conversations over text message past midnight every night, fell asleep to each other\u2019s voices on the phone, and were the first to say good morning the next day. </p><p>You awoke one Saturday morning to a couple of text tones coming from the nightstand beside your bed. You pulled it towards you, unlocking it as you blinked sleepily. Unable to read the messages on the bright screen, you decided to call Peter. He picked up on the first ring. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna do something today?\u201d You asked in between a yawn. When the other end was silent for a couple of moments, you felt your heartbeat quicken, worried you had crossed a line. You and Peter had not met in person since the day you had met, a little over a month ago. You sat up in your bed, waking up quickly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re busy. Sorry, I totally understand if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter interrupted, \u201cno no no no no!\u201d You laughed a little as his insistence. \u201cI\u2019d love to. It\u2019s just,\u201d he sighed, \u201cthe Homecoming dance is tonight, and I promised Aunt May I\u2019d let her help me get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, Homecoming. Sounds fun! Got a hot date?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cYeah, no. I wouldn\u2019t go at all if Ned hadn\u2019t insisted I come. But he got a date, asked her just yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Peter,\u201d you teased. \u201cAt the dance all by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll just hide in the bathroom the whole time.\u201d</p><p>You laughed. \u201cI have a feeling that\u2019s what I\u2019d do during a school dance, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Peter said, coming to a realization. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been to a school dance.\u201d He said it rather than asked it, but you felt yourself nod, even though he wouldn\u2019t be able to see. You felt your heart thudding in your chest. \u201cWould you like to go to one?\u201d His voice was small, as if he was nervous. </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun, Pete,\u201d you said, surprised you were able to form complete sentences. Nervous excitement fluttered through your veins, and you felt your cheeks flush as you heard Peter\u2019s \u201cAwesome!\u201d</p><p>You thought your dad would\u2019ve been mad hearing that you\u2019d made plans without asking him, but as you soon understood, to Tony Stark, Peter was about the least dangerous person his child could be spending their time with. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for your father to buy you an outfit to be brought to Stark Tower. What took a long time was the hour after you had finished getting ready, just following dinner that night, when you had to wait for Peter to arrive. Your father had refused to let you wait downstairs, so you had to stand outside the elevator door, waiting for the light to flash and the doors to open. </p><p>You were drumming your fingers on your knee when you heard the ping. Standing up and straightening out your clothes, you took a deep breath. </p><p>But when the doors opened, it was simply Happy, with a light smile on his face, his eyebrows raised at your not-so-friendly glare. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were Peter,\u201d you mumbled, sighing. Happy chuckled. </p><p>\u201cGood to see you too, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Happy?\u201d you asked, your hand returning to your knee, where it continued to tap anxiously. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good actually,\u201d Happy said. \u201cThe company\u2019s doing well, your dad\u2019s been off my back-\u201d The elevator pinged again, and you jumped to your feet, ignoring Happy as you met eyes Peter through the slowly opening elevator doors. </p><p>He looked gorgeous. You had forgotten just how gorgeous he was. His black suit fit him perfectly, and his puppy dog eyes lit up when they saw you. \u201cY/N\u2026\u201d Peter said quietly, his voice fading out. You felt a flutter of butterflies in your stomach, your cheeks heating up from his gaze. And then Tony Stark stepped in front of you, blocking your view. </p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony acknowledged. </p><p>\u201cMr-Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter stuttered. \u201cHow\u2026How\u2019s it going?\u201d His voice sounded small as Tony put an arm around his shoulder and ushered him into the apartment. </p><p>\u201cWonderful, Peter. Just wonderful.\u201d You saw Peter flinch at the tight grip your father had on his arm. You rolled your eyes. </p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d you said, your voice firm. Your dad looked at you then, an innocent look on his face. </p><p>\u201cWhat, y/n? I just want to give your friend Pete a little talk.\u201d You gave Peter an apologetic glance, but you figured he\u2019d handle it fine; Tony wasn\u2019t as scary as he liked to think he was. </p><p>After Peter\u2019s face went pale from Tony\u2019s threats, the two of you stood by the elevator door, wishing Happy and Tony a good night. When the elevator doors finally closed, you both let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d you said, a grin on your face. Peter laughed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I think your dad likes me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think he does too. He\u2019s not good at admitting stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for the dance?\u201d Peter asked, glancing over at you. He still seemed nervous, and you could feel the butterflies still fluttering around your stomach. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you answered honestly, chuckling softly. \u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d </p><p>Your heart jumped when you felt Peter\u2019s cool hands over your own. You looked at him, your breathing uneven. And then, before giving yourself the chance to change your mind, you pressed the stop button on the elevator, trapping the car between floors. </p><p>\u201cWha-\u201d Peter started to ask, but you interrupted them. </p><p>\u201cBefore we get there,\u201d you took a deep breath to steady yourself. \u201cI just wanted to tell you\u2026I really like you Pete, and I know you probably just asked me to this dance as a friend, but I just thought you should know.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes widened, but he looked at a loss for words. Your heart was pounding, cheeks flushed in nervous embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said as he stayed silent. You unwound your hand from his, the butterflies quickly turning into nausea. You felt tears well in your eyes as you desperately wished you hadn\u2019t said anything at all. </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter said, grabbing your wrist and pulling you closer. Up close, you could see the pink tinting his cheeks, and you were sure he could feel your heartbeat from where his fingers gripped your wrist. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t invite you as more than a friend. I\u2026\u201d But you had gotten all the confirmation you needed. </p><p>You raised your free hand to cup his cheek, and leaned in the remaining distance. It was awkward at first, and your noses bumped together uncomfortably, but Peter wound his other arm around your waist, and you felt warm in all the places you were touching: your fingers on his cheek, his hand on your back, and his cool fingers wrapped around your wrist. When you pulled away (too soon in your opinion), you were both out of breath. You smiled up at Peter, your eyes opening slowly to meet his puppy dog ones. The moment would have been perfect, had it not been for the robotic voice that came on through the elevator\u2019s intercom system. </p><p>\u201cY/N Stark,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y. said. You groaned, already knowing what this was about. \u201cYour father would like to ask you to stop making out with your boyfriend long enough to resume the elevator functioning. All deliveries to the upper floors are being blocked.\u201d Your face grew hot, and you buried it in Peter\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cCameras,\u201d you mumbled. Peter pressed the button to start the elevator again, but you suspected his cheeks were as red as yours. \u201cMy dad\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d</p></p>",

Right now, you were enjoying one of them, enjoying the view from the top of Stark Tower as you curled up with a book, basking in the summer heat and feeling the light breeze through your hair.</p><p>It was the first time you\u2019d had the opportunity to read your book all week, and you were loving the silence this time alone brought you. Your dad had just gotten home from a long mission, and refused to leave you alone for more than two seconds all week. But you had woken this morning to find a note on the counter, explaining how he had to leave on urgent business in the middle of the night. </p><p>After years of impromptu Avengers missions, you knew the drill. He\u2019d be back when he\u2019d be back, and for now, the penthouse suite of Stark Tower was yours to do whatever you wanted. </p><p>And right now, that meant a quiet morning with your book. The silence was so unbelievable that you almost didn\u2019t bat an eye when you heard someone clear their throat behind you. Almost. </p><p>Knowing your father wouldn\u2019t be home anytime soon, your first instinct was to freeze, the book in your hands no longer holding your interest. But the voice that came next belonged to a teenage boy. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you know where Tony Stark is?\u201d you heard, and you spun around in your seat to find a boy around your age, wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a cheesy pun about periodic tables. </p><p>Frowning, you stood up from your seat. \u201cWho are you, and what are you doing in my house?\u201d</p><p>The boy flushed, shifting his weight as he looked at you apologetically. \u201cSorry, I know this is Mr. Stark\u2019s private penthouse, but I was supposed to meet him today, and Happy told me he might be up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out,\u201d you replied, still intrigued by the stranger across from you. </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re his\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d you answered, crossing your arms. \u201cWhy are you meeting with my dad?\u201d</p><p>The kid shifted again, very obviously uncomfortable. \u201cI-I\u2019m\u2026an intern. I work with your father?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t need the boy\u2019s horrible lying abilities to know that your father didn\u2019t have any teenage interns working for his company. Not any that were allowed to come up to his penthouse suite to have a chat with him, anyway. But it took you a few seconds to register what that meant. A teenage boy, in the city, who came to have meetings with your father? </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Spiderman!\u201d You said, finally coming to the realization. The boy went pale, shaking his head. You rolled your eyes. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not gonna rat you out or anything. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be able to lie your way out of it; you\u2019ve already proven yourself to be pretty horrible at that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sheepishly, but held out his hand. \u201cPeter Parker,\u201d he said, and you shook his hand. </p><p>\u201cY/N. Y/N Stark,\u201d you added, \u201cbut it seems like you already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, y/n,\u201d Peter said, \u201cI guess I should leave to your book. It was nice meeting you!\u201d He smiled kindly, waving awkwardly as he turned around. </p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d you yelled, and then smiled, composing yourself as he turned back towards you. \u201cYou should stay. My dad might be home soon, and if he was asking to meet with you, I\u2019m sure it was important.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude,\u201d Peter said, motioning to your setup on the chair. </p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not intruding on anything. Sit down,\u201d you said, motioning to the other chairs around you, slumping back into your own seat. Peter took a seat, but he looked hesitant, perched uncomfortably on the edge of his chair. </p><p>You ignored this and returned to gazing at the skyline. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice view, huh?\u201d you asked. </p><p>Peter let out a breath you didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been holding in, settling into his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks so distant, though. I mean, I know we\u2019re right in the middle of it, but it feels like there\u2019s a glass wall between us and the city.\u201d You looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cWhat would happen if you jumped off the building right now?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, since I\u2019m not wearing my suit, I would most likely fall to my death.\u201d You snorted. </p><p>\u201cBut if you were wearing it. You\u2019d just fly.\u201d You sighed. \u201cSounds freeing.\u201d The next few moments passed in silence, and you glanced at Peter, who looked unsure of what to say. You decided to change the subject. \u201cSo, you\u2019re in high school, right? Where do you go to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidtown School of Science and Technology,\u201d Peter recited. You nodded, recognizing the name as a well known STEM school in the city. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cI\u2019m homeschooled. When my dad has time, he teaches me, but I have some tutors both online and that come here sometimes. I don\u2019t leave the tower very much. Does it show?\u201d You teased, laughing. </p><p>He laughed too, but he shook his head. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you meeting my father, Spiderman? I heard you\u2019d given up your Avenger\u2019s position to stay local.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark likes me to check in every once in awhile,\u201d Peter answered. \u201cHe makes adjustments to my suit too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d you asked curiously. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like your dad, or any of the Avengers. I\u2019m Peter Parker, I\u2019m no one, and my talents are better served as a friendly neighborhood Spiderman than someone who saves the world.\u201d He looked down at his lap. \u201cIt was cowardly, I guess.\u201d You frowned. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s noble.\u201d Peter looked up. You were about to go into a speech about how helping the little guy was just as important as saving the world when Peter stood up abruptly. </p><p>\u201cI really should go. Mr. Stark\u2019s not going to be here anytime soon, is he?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201cProbably not,\u201d you answered honestly. </p><p>Peter nodded, heading towards the door. \u201cIt was nice talking to you,\u201d he said, smiling kindly. He looked like a puppy dog, and his soft brown eyes made you smile. </p><p>\u201cIs it alright if I text you?\u201d you asked, surprising yourself, and Peter it seemed, who flushed red quicker than you imagined possible. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of friends my age, you know, with the homeschooling and everything,\u201d you explained. Peter nodded his head, and you swore you saw a smile on his face. You stood up quickly, pulling your phone from your pocket. You already had a new text message opened by the time you made it to Peter. You handed him your phone, and he typed in a number. When you got the phone back, you typed a quick \u201csup\u201d with the peace sign emoji, and sent it. It took seconds for Peter\u2019s phone to buzz, his screen lighting up as he added you to his contacts as well. </p><p>Peter looked up from his phone, looking as if he wanted to say something, but then he bit his lip and said, \u201cSee you around, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You smiled. \u201cSee you around, Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>When your father got home later that evening, you told him about Peter\u2019s visit.</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter,\u201d Tony said, scratching his face. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s this new intern at Stark Industries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know he\u2019s Spiderman, dad,\u201d you said, rolling your eyes. \u201cBut thanks for your trust in me.\u201d</p><p>Tony winked at you. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out? Did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. What kind of teenage intern would be allowed to visit you in your penthouse suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow was your mission?\u201d you asked curiously. </p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not allowed to disclose details,\u201d Tony said, waving you off. </p><p>\u201cPretty please?\u201d you asked, batting your eyes. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll just hack into your mission files tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>You raised your eyebrows. \u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You decided to send Peter a text for the first time the next morning. Tony was making waffles, and you were tasting the batter as you balanced a calculus textbook on your lap. </p><p>Tony was rambling on about the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which you had neglected to tell him was the subject of the week before\u2019s lesson with your tutor Mrs. Greene. Your phone was unlocked, sitting on the textbook, and you pulled up Peter\u2019s contact info, biting your lip as you debated tapping the message button. Taking a deep breath, you clicked on it, and your heartbeat sped up as the text message opened. </p><p>You settled on a cute Spiderman meme, a little teasing in nature, and hit send before you had the chance to talk yourself out of it. </p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re ignoring me,\u201d Tony huffed dramatically. He set a waffle on your plate, pouting like a child. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d you said, grinning as you took a big bite. </p><p>Tony sighed. \u201cJust do your homework, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>The rest of your breakfast was in silence as Tony continued piling waffles on your plate as you worked your way through advanced calculus problems. When you felt a light buzz on your lap, you almost jumped in your seat. </p><p>Peter\u2019s response was a quick gif of your dad with the caption \u201cI AM IRON MAN\u201d. You giggled lightly, sending a quick response before you locked your phone again. </p><p>\u201cWhat so funny?\u201d Tony asked, leaning over the counter. \u201cCertainly not the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?\u201d</p><p>You laughed again. \u201cApparently they\u2019re making memes about you, Dad.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s making memes about me?\u201d You shrugged, laughing harder at his expression. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s it.\u201d He grabbed your plate, despite your protests. \u201cGo to your room. Maybe you can focus better in there.\u201d</p><p>But it didn\u2019t really improve your focus as much as your father had hoped. On your way back to your bedroom, you texted Peter again. <i>Great, you got me in trouble with my dad. Way to go. </i>\ud83d\ude44</p><p><i>Sorry :(</i></p><p>When arrived at your room, you threw the calculus book on the floor, forgotten, as you climbed onto your bed. </p><p><i>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s upset or ecstatic that he\u2019s essentially a walking meme. </i></p><p><i>Ecstatic. For sure. </i></p><p>Over the course of the next few weeks, you and Peter became close friends over text. Despite never seeing each other in person, you held conversations over text message past midnight every night, fell asleep to each other\u2019s voices on the phone, and were the first to say good morning the next day. </p><p>You awoke one Saturday morning to a couple of text tones coming from the nightstand beside your bed. You pulled it towards you, unlocking it as you blinked sleepily. Unable to read the messages on the bright screen, you decided to call Peter. He picked up on the first ring. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna do something today?\u201d You asked in between a yawn. When the other end was silent for a couple of moments, you felt your heartbeat quicken, worried you had crossed a line. You and Peter had not met in person since the day you had met, a little over a month ago. You sat up in your bed, waking up quickly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re busy. Sorry, I totally understand if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter interrupted, \u201cno no no no no!\u201d You laughed a little as his insistence. \u201cI\u2019d love to. It\u2019s just,\u201d he sighed, \u201cthe Homecoming dance is tonight, and I promised Aunt May I\u2019d let her help me get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, Homecoming. Sounds fun! Got a hot date?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cYeah, no. I wouldn\u2019t go at all if Ned hadn\u2019t insisted I come. But he got a date, asked her just yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Peter,\u201d you teased. \u201cAt the dance all by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll just hide in the bathroom the whole time.\u201d</p><p>You laughed. \u201cI have a feeling that\u2019s what I\u2019d do during a school dance, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Peter said, coming to a realization. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been to a school dance.\u201d He said it rather than asked it, but you felt yourself nod, even though he wouldn\u2019t be able to see. You felt your heart thudding in your chest. \u201cWould you like to go to one?\u201d His voice was small, as if he was nervous. </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like fun, Pete,\u201d you said, surprised you were able to form complete sentences. Nervous excitement fluttered through your veins, and you felt your cheeks flush as you heard Peter\u2019s \u201cAwesome!\u201d</p><p>You thought your dad would\u2019ve been mad hearing that you\u2019d made plans without asking him, but as you soon understood, to Tony Stark, Peter was about the least dangerous person his child could be spending their time with. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for your father to buy you an outfit to be brought to Stark Tower. What took a long time was the hour after you had finished getting ready, just following dinner that night, when you had to wait for Peter to arrive. Your father had refused to let you wait downstairs, so you had to stand outside the elevator door, waiting for the light to flash and the doors to open. </p><p>You were drumming your fingers on your knee when you heard the ping. Standing up and straightening out your clothes, you took a deep breath. </p><p>But when the doors opened, it was simply Happy, with a light smile on his face, his eyebrows raised at your not-so-friendly glare. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were Peter,\u201d you mumbled, sighing. Happy chuckled. </p><p>\u201cGood to see you too, y/n.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Happy?\u201d you asked, your hand returning to your knee, where it continued to tap anxiously. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good actually,\u201d Happy said. \u201cThe company\u2019s doing well, your dad\u2019s been off my back-\u201d The elevator pinged again, and you jumped to your feet, ignoring Happy as you met eyes Peter through the slowly opening elevator doors. </p><p>He looked gorgeous. You had forgotten just how gorgeous he was. His black suit fit him perfectly, and his puppy dog eyes lit up when they saw you. \u201cY/N\u2026\u201d Peter said quietly, his voice fading out. You felt a flutter of butterflies in your stomach, your cheeks heating up from his gaze. And then Tony Stark stepped in front of you, blocking your view. </p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony acknowledged. </p><p>\u201cMr-Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter stuttered. \u201cHow\u2026How\u2019s it going?\u201d His voice sounded small as Tony put an arm around his shoulder and ushered him into the apartment. </p><p>\u201cWonderful, Peter. Just wonderful.\u201d You saw Peter flinch at the tight grip your father had on his arm. You rolled your eyes. </p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d you said, your voice firm. Your dad looked at you then, an innocent look on his face. </p><p>\u201cWhat, y/n? I just want to give your friend Pete a little talk.\u201d You gave Peter an apologetic glance, but you figured he\u2019d handle it fine; Tony wasn\u2019t as scary as he liked to think he was. </p><p>After Peter\u2019s face went pale from Tony\u2019s threats, the two of you stood by the elevator door, wishing Happy and Tony a good night. When the elevator doors finally closed, you both let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d you said, a grin on your face. Peter laughed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I think your dad likes me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think he does too. He\u2019s not good at admitting stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for the dance?\u201d Peter asked, glancing over at you. He still seemed nervous, and you could feel the butterflies still fluttering around your stomach. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you answered honestly, chuckling softly. \u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d </p><p>Your heart jumped when you felt Peter\u2019s cool hands over your own. You looked at him, your breathing uneven. And then, before giving yourself the chance to change your mind, you pressed the stop button on the elevator, trapping the car between floors. </p><p>\u201cWha-\u201d Peter started to ask, but you interrupted them. </p><p>\u201cBefore we get there,\u201d you took a deep breath to steady yourself. \u201cI just wanted to tell you\u2026I really like you Pete, and I know you probably just asked me to this dance as a friend, but I just thought you should know.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes widened, but he looked at a loss for words. Your heart was pounding, cheeks flushed in nervous embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said as he stayed silent. You unwound your hand from his, the butterflies quickly turning into nausea. You felt tears well in your eyes as you desperately wished you hadn\u2019t said anything at all. </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter said, grabbing your wrist and pulling you closer. Up close, you could see the pink tinting his cheeks, and you were sure he could feel your heartbeat from where his fingers gripped your wrist. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t invite you as more than a friend. I\u2026\u201d But you had gotten all the confirmation you needed. </p><p>You raised your free hand to cup his cheek, and leaned in the remaining distance. It was awkward at first, and your noses bumped together uncomfortably, but Peter wound his other arm around your waist, and you felt warm in all the places you were touching: your fingers on his cheek, his hand on your back, and his cool fingers wrapped around your wrist. When you pulled away (too soon in your opinion), you were both out of breath. You smiled up at Peter, your eyes opening slowly to meet his puppy dog ones. The moment would have been perfect, had it not been for the robotic voice that came on through the elevator\u2019s intercom system. </p><p>\u201cY/N Stark,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y. said. You groaned, already knowing what this was about. \u201cYour father would like to ask you to stop making out with your boyfriend long enough to resume the elevator functioning. All deliveries to the upper floors are being blocked.\u201d Your face grew hot, and you buried it in Peter\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cCameras,\u201d you mumbled. Peter pressed the button to start the elevator again, but you suspected his cheeks were as red as yours. \u201cMy dad\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d</p></p>",

You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not gonna rat you out or anything. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re going to be able to lie your way out of it; you&rsquo;ve already proven yourself to be pretty horrible at that.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled sheepishly, but held out his hand. &ldquo;Peter Parker,&rdquo; he said, and you shook his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. Y/N Stark,&rdquo; you added, &ldquo;but it seems like you already knew that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, y/n,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;I guess I should leave to your book. It was nice meeting you!&rdquo; He smiled kindly, waving awkwardly as he turned around. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; you yelled, and then smiled, composing yourself as he turned back towards you. &ldquo;You should stay. My dad might be home soon, and if he was asking to meet with you, I&rsquo;m sure it was important.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to intrude,&rdquo; Peter said, motioning to your setup on the chair. </p><p>You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not intruding on anything. Sit down,&rdquo; you said, motioning to the other chairs around you, slumping back into your own seat. Peter took a seat, but he looked hesitant, perched uncomfortably on the edge of his chair. </p><p>You ignored this and returned to gazing at the skyline. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice view, huh?&rdquo; you asked. </p><p>Peter let out a breath you didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d been holding in, settling into his chair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It looks so distant, though. I mean, I know we&rsquo;re right in the middle of it, but it feels like there&rsquo;s a glass wall between us and the city.&rdquo; You looked at him thoughtfully. &ldquo;What would happen if you jumped off the building right now?&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed. &ldquo;Well, since I&rsquo;m not wearing my suit, I would most likely fall to my death.&rdquo; You snorted. </p><p>&ldquo;But if you were wearing it. You&rsquo;d just fly.&rdquo; You sighed. &ldquo;Sounds freeing.&rdquo; The next few moments passed in silence, and you glanced at Peter, who looked unsure of what to say. You decided to change the subject. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re in high school, right? Where do you go to school?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Midtown School of Science and Technology,&rdquo; Peter recited. You nodded, recognizing the name as a well known STEM school in the city. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m homeschooled. When my dad has time, he teaches me, but I have some tutors both online and that come here sometimes. I don&rsquo;t leave the tower very much. Does it show?&rdquo; You teased, laughing. </p><p>He laughed too, but he shook his head. &ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So why are you meeting my father, Spiderman? I heard you&rsquo;d given up your Avenger&rsquo;s position to stay local.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark likes me to check in every once in awhile,&rdquo; Peter answered. &ldquo;He makes adjustments to my suit too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo; you asked curiously. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not like your dad, or any of the Avengers. I&rsquo;m Peter Parker, I&rsquo;m no one, and my talents are better served as a friendly neighborhood Spiderman than someone who saves the world.&rdquo; He looked down at his lap. &ldquo;It was cowardly, I guess.&rdquo; You frowned. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s noble.&rdquo; Peter looked up. You were about to go into a speech about how helping the little guy was just as important as saving the world when Peter stood up abruptly. </p><p>&ldquo;I really should go. Mr. Stark&rsquo;s not going to be here anytime soon, is he?&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed. &ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; you answered honestly. </p><p>Peter nodded, heading towards the door. &ldquo;It was nice talking to you,&rdquo; he said, smiling kindly. He looked like a puppy dog, and his soft brown eyes made you smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Is it alright if I text you?&rdquo; you asked, surprising yourself, and Peter it seemed, who flushed red quicker than you imagined possible. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a lot of friends my age, you know, with the homeschooling and everything,&rdquo; you explained. Peter nodded his head, and you swore you saw a smile on his face. You stood up quickly, pulling your phone from your pocket. You already had a new text message opened by the time you made it to Peter. You handed him your phone, and he typed in a number. When you got the phone back, you typed a quick &ldquo;sup&rdquo; with the peace sign emoji, and sent it. It took seconds for Peter&rsquo;s phone to buzz, his screen lighting up as he added you to his contacts as well. </p><p>Peter looked up from his phone, looking as if he wanted to say something, but then he bit his lip and said, &ldquo;See you around, y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled. &ldquo;See you around, Spiderman.&rdquo;</p><p>When your father got home later that evening, you told him about Peter&rsquo;s visit.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter,&rdquo; Tony said, scratching his face. &ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s this new intern at Stark Industries.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I already know he&rsquo;s Spiderman, dad,&rdquo; you said, rolling your eyes. &ldquo;But thanks for your trust in me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony winked at you. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you find out? Did he tell you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please. What kind of teenage intern would be allowed to visit you in your penthouse suite?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Touch&eacute;.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How was your mission?&rdquo; you asked curiously. </p><p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not allowed to disclose details,&rdquo; Tony said, waving you off. </p><p>&ldquo;Pretty please?&rdquo; you asked, batting your eyes. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ll just hack into your mission files tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you try.&rdquo;</p><p>You raised your eyebrows. &ldquo;Is that a challenge?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You decided to send Peter a text for the first time the next morning. Tony was making waffles, and you were tasting the batter as you balanced a calculus textbook on your lap. </p><p>Tony was rambling on about the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which you had neglected to tell him was the subject of the week before&rsquo;s lesson with your tutor Mrs. Greene. Your phone was unlocked, sitting on the textbook, and you pulled up Peter&rsquo;s contact info, biting your lip as you debated tapping the message button. Taking a deep breath, you clicked on it, and your heartbeat sped up as the text message opened. </p><p>You settled on a cute Spiderman meme, a little teasing in nature, and hit send before you had the chance to talk yourself out of it. </p><p>&ldquo;I feel like you&rsquo;re ignoring me,&rdquo; Tony huffed dramatically. He set a waffle on your plate, pouting like a child. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; you said, grinning as you took a big bite. </p><p>Tony sighed. &ldquo;Just do your homework, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will do.&rdquo;</p><p>The rest of your breakfast was in silence as Tony continued piling waffles on your plate as you worked your way through advanced calculus problems. When you felt a light buzz on your lap, you almost jumped in your seat. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s response was a quick gif of your dad with the caption &ldquo;I AM IRON MAN&rdquo;. You giggled lightly, sending a quick response before you locked your phone again. </p><p>&ldquo;What so funny?&rdquo; Tony asked, leaning over the counter. &ldquo;Certainly not the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed again. &ldquo;Apparently they&rsquo;re making memes about you, Dad.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony frowned. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s making memes about me?&rdquo; You shrugged, laughing harder at his expression. &ldquo;Alright, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; He grabbed your plate, despite your protests. &ldquo;Go to your room. Maybe you can focus better in there.&rdquo;</p><p>But it didn&rsquo;t really improve your focus as much as your father had hoped. On your way back to your bedroom, you texted Peter again. <i>Great, you got me in trouble with my dad. Way to go. </i>&#128580;</p><p><i>Sorry :(</i></p><p>When arrived at your room, you threw the calculus book on the floor, forgotten, as you climbed onto your bed. </p><p><i>I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;s upset or ecstatic that he&rsquo;s essentially a walking meme. </i></p><p><i>Ecstatic. For sure. </i></p><p>Over the course of the next few weeks, you and Peter became close friends over text. Despite never seeing each other in person, you held conversations over text message past midnight every night, fell asleep to each other&rsquo;s voices on the phone, and were the first to say good morning the next day. </p><p>You awoke one Saturday morning to a couple of text tones coming from the nightstand beside your bed. You pulled it towards you, unlocking it as you blinked sleepily. Unable to read the messages on the bright screen, you decided to call Peter. He picked up on the first ring. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna do something today?&rdquo; You asked in between a yawn. When the other end was silent for a couple of moments, you felt your heartbeat quicken, worried you had crossed a line. You and Peter had not met in person since the day you had met, a little over a month ago. You sat up in your bed, waking up quickly. &ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re busy. Sorry, I totally understand if-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peter interrupted, &ldquo;no no no no no!&rdquo; You laughed a little as his insistence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to. It&rsquo;s just,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;the Homecoming dance is tonight, and I promised Aunt May I&rsquo;d let her help me get ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, Homecoming. Sounds fun! Got a hot date?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, no. I wouldn&rsquo;t go at all if Ned hadn&rsquo;t insisted I come. But he got a date, asked her just yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor Peter,&rdquo; you teased. &ldquo;At the dance all by himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;ll just hide in the bathroom the whole time.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed. &ldquo;I have a feeling that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do during a school dance, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Peter said, coming to a realization. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never been to a school dance.&rdquo; He said it rather than asked it, but you felt yourself nod, even though he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see. You felt your heart thudding in your chest. &ldquo;Would you like to go to one?&rdquo; His voice was small, as if he was nervous. </p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like fun, Pete,&rdquo; you said, surprised you were able to form complete sentences. Nervous excitement fluttered through your veins, and you felt your cheeks flush as you heard Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo;</p><p>You thought your dad would&rsquo;ve been mad hearing that you&rsquo;d made plans without asking him, but as you soon understood, to Tony Stark, Peter was about the least dangerous person his child could be spending their time with. </p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for your father to buy you an outfit to be brought to Stark Tower. What took a long time was the hour after you had finished getting ready, just following dinner that night, when you had to wait for Peter to arrive. Your father had refused to let you wait downstairs, so you had to stand outside the elevator door, waiting for the light to flash and the doors to open. </p><p>You were drumming your fingers on your knee when you heard the ping. Standing up and straightening out your clothes, you took a deep breath. </p><p>But when the doors opened, it was simply Happy, with a light smile on his face, his eyebrows raised at your not-so-friendly glare. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were Peter,&rdquo; you mumbled, sighing. Happy chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Good to see you too, y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going, Happy?&rdquo; you asked, your hand returning to your knee, where it continued to tap anxiously. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty good actually,&rdquo; Happy said. &ldquo;The company&rsquo;s doing well, your dad&rsquo;s been off my back-&rdquo; The elevator pinged again, and you jumped to your feet, ignoring Happy as you met eyes Peter through the slowly opening elevator doors. </p><p>He looked gorgeous. You had forgotten just how gorgeous he was. His black suit fit him perfectly, and his puppy dog eyes lit up when they saw you. &ldquo;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; Peter said quietly, his voice fading out. You felt a flutter of butterflies in your stomach, your cheeks heating up from his gaze. And then Tony Stark stepped in front of you, blocking your view. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Tony acknowledged. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr-Mr. Stark,&rdquo; Peter stuttered. &ldquo;How&hellip;How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; His voice sounded small as Tony put an arm around his shoulder and ushered him into the apartment. </p><p>&ldquo;Wonderful, Peter. Just wonderful.&rdquo; You saw Peter flinch at the tight grip your father had on his arm. You rolled your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Dad.&rdquo; you said, your voice firm. Your dad looked at you then, an innocent look on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;What, y/n? I just want to give your friend Pete a little talk.&rdquo; You gave Peter an apologetic glance, but you figured he&rsquo;d handle it fine; Tony wasn&rsquo;t as scary as he liked to think he was. </p><p>After Peter&rsquo;s face went pale from Tony&rsquo;s threats, the two of you stood by the elevator door, wishing Happy and Tony a good night. When the elevator doors finally closed, you both let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry about that,&rdquo; you said, a grin on your face. Peter laughed. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I think your dad likes me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think he does too. He&rsquo;s not good at admitting stuff like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready for the dance?&rdquo; Peter asked, glancing over at you. He still seemed nervous, and you could feel the butterflies still fluttering around your stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you answered honestly, chuckling softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terrified.&rdquo; </p><p>Your heart jumped when you felt Peter&rsquo;s cool hands over your own. You looked at him, your breathing uneven. And then, before giving yourself the chance to change your mind, you pressed the stop button on the elevator, trapping the car between floors. </p><p>&ldquo;Wha-&rdquo; Peter started to ask, but you interrupted them. </p><p>&ldquo;Before we get there,&rdquo; you took a deep breath to steady yourself. &ldquo;I just wanted to tell you&hellip;I really like you Pete, and I know you probably just asked me to this dance as a friend, but I just thought you should know.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened, but he looked at a loss for words. Your heart was pounding, cheeks flushed in nervous embarrassment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you said as he stayed silent. You unwound your hand from his, the butterflies quickly turning into nausea. You felt tears well in your eyes as you desperately wished you hadn&rsquo;t said anything at all. </p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Peter said, grabbing your wrist and pulling you closer. Up close, you could see the pink tinting his cheeks, and you were sure he could feel your heartbeat from where his fingers gripped your wrist. &ldquo;I&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t invite you as more than a friend. I&hellip;&rdquo; But you had gotten all the confirmation you needed. </p><p>You raised your free hand to cup his cheek, and leaned in the remaining distance. It was awkward at first, and your noses bumped together uncomfortably, but Peter wound his other arm around your waist, and you felt warm in all the places you were touching: your fingers on his cheek, his hand on your back, and his cool fingers wrapped around your wrist. When you pulled away (too soon in your opinion), you were both out of breath. You smiled up at Peter, your eyes opening slowly to meet his puppy dog ones. The moment would have been perfect, had it not been for the robotic voice that came on through the elevator&rsquo;s intercom system. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N Stark,&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y. said. You groaned, already knowing what this was about. &ldquo;Your father would like to ask you to stop making out with your boyfriend long enough to resume the elevator functioning. All deliveries to the upper floors are being blocked.&rdquo; Your face grew hot, and you buried it in Peter&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Cameras,&rdquo; you mumbled. Peter pressed the button to start the elevator again, but you suspected his cheeks were as red as yours. &ldquo;My dad&rsquo;s going to kill you.&rdquo;</p></p>",
