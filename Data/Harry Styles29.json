        "body": "<p><b><i>A/N: in typical Katie fashion, I have gone away for a few days and ended up being proper in my head about Harry. So, I wrote something down real quick to give you a small idea about what I\u2019ve been doing on my time off. Special thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRMY0yYTxRHkm07sIyZRgw\">@all-things-fic</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> for being constant inspiration for me to write shit like this. As always - THOUGHTS PLEASE! Xxx</i></b></p><p>You\u2019re feeling an exhaustion you\u2019re not used to. It\u2019s not overworked tiredness or stressed out lethargy, no it\u2019s something else entirely. It\u2019s a content feeling, one of fulfilled happiness and bliss that even though you don\u2019t feel it all too often, over the past few days it\u2019s all you\u2019ve felt.</p><p>It\u2019s stemmed from walking for miles under the hot sun and sea air, taken between long swings of warm water because your bag is no cooler. It tires your muscles and your mind, but in the most wonderful way. And it hits you around the same time everyday; late afternoon when your day begins to slow down.</p><p>You\u2019ve been watching the waves crash against the wall of the beach with the incoming tide for about ten minutes, while carefully tonguing your way around a Mr Whippy, careful not to get your hair stuck in the cream with the unpredictable and mindless wind. The combined sounds of the waves lapping and crashing against the concrete barrier, with squawking seagulls circling above you and bubble of talks from everyone around you fills you with a satisfying nostalgia. You spent a lot of time at seasides like this as a kid, but it\u2019s not something you\u2019ve particularly had time to enjoy as a fully fledged grown up.</p><p>As you finish the small remainder of your ice cream cone, Harry\u2019s hand silently slips into yours as he begins to tug you towards the coastal path you\u2019ve been secretly putting off. Your legs are tired, and you\u2019re about ready to collapse.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweets.\u201d Harry chuckles at your slight yet obvious resistance. \u201cIf we don\u2019t walk there won\u2019t be any time for 2p machines on the pier.\u201d</p><p><i>Jesus, he\u2019s always known what to say. </i>His words have you with a spring in your step once again, and you\u2019re making it your work to keep in pace beside him.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you going to let me on the 2p machines though?\u201d You challenge childishly, peering up at him with sceptical eyes through your sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you want.\u201d He grins down at you, squeezing your hand in his.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea - we\u2019ll be there all night.\u201d You warn with a shake your head.</p><p>\u201cI just like seeing you get stroppy when the machine eats the coins.\u201d</p><p>You scowl up at him and scoff. \u201cI do not get stroppy, thank you.\u201d You definitely do get stroppy, you\u2019re even contradicting yourself now.</p><p>\u201cEh, none a\u2019that.\u201d He insists, pulling you in front of him so that his chest is flat against your back, his arms crossed over your chest so that admittedly it\u2019s difficult to walk. \u201cI also like how hilarious you are when you win something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I hilarious?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re met with silence, Harry either thinking too hard on his answer or regretting saying anything in the first place. Regardless of the answer, he\u2019s sure to prove himself right in about half an hour.</p><p>You join the concrete coastal path, decorated with a light dusting of sand and the occasional puddle or dark shadow from where a child has exited the sea and dripped their way back to their parent. The sea is on your right, turquoise and glistening under the light of the sun in the gloriously clear blue sky. The sea dances with the reflection, like diamonds have been scattered. If the water were still you might be able to see your reflection.</p><p>All along the beach front are wooden panels that separate equal sized patches of coarse sand plains, each chunk littered with families and couples, and also the occasional dog.</p><p>To your left are the pale chalk cliff sides, lined with warned wooden fences and beds of flowers and weeds. They\u2019re topped with grass, occasionally a fence bordering an incredibly well placed abode. The area is notorious for landslides, and you know you would personally never live that close to the edge - you\u2019re anxious just thinking about it.</p><p>The walk from Shanklin to Sandown is one not unfamiliar to you, a nice length and plenty to look at on a day as beautiful as today. You\u2019ve already walked it once today, Harry having parked the car on Sandown seafront and the two of you taking a leisurely stroll along to Shanklin for fish and chips, ice cream and a round of mini-golf. You\u2019d won the mini-golf, and Harry had accused you of cheating - when in fact, he was the one cheating.</p><p>It\u2019s been the best weather for an Easter bank holiday weekend for a long time, and apparently the Isle of Wight was the place Harry wanted to spend it with you.

It tires your muscles and your mind, but in the most wonderful way. And it hits you around the same time everyday; late afternoon when your day begins to slow down.</p><p>You\u2019ve been watching the waves crash against the wall of the beach with the incoming tide for about ten minutes, while carefully tonguing your way around a Mr Whippy, careful not to get your hair stuck in the cream with the unpredictable and mindless wind. The combined sounds of the waves lapping and crashing against the concrete barrier, with squawking seagulls circling above you and bubble of talks from everyone around you fills you with a satisfying nostalgia.

The sea is on your right, turquoise and glistening under the light of the sun in the gloriously clear blue sky. The sea dances with the reflection, like diamonds have been scattered. If the water were still you might be able to see your reflection.</p><p>All along the beach front are wooden panels that separate equal sized patches of coarse sand plains, each chunk littered with families and couples, and also the occasional dog.</p><p>To your left are the pale chalk cliff sides, lined with warned wooden fences and beds of flowers and weeds.

It\u2019s quite endearing really, and you do love that about him, but you can see the pier less than five hundred yards away now - it\u2019s literally right there, and you\u2019re just itching to get inside.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so cute,\u201d Harry gushes, crouched down and incredibly smiley as he pets the next dog, \u201cisn\u2019t he cute, love?\u201d He asks as he beams up at you.</p><p>You had been too distracted watching a child write a message in the sand just below you, trying to work out what he was actually writing. So far you\u2019ve made out \u2018chiken nug\u2019\u2026 clearly it\u2019s going well.</p><p>You glance down to Harry with the labradoodle puppy and smile warmly with a gentle nod. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>You wait patiently as Harry says goodbye to the owners, you offering a light wave as he retakes your hand and continues walking, swinging your hands wildly between your bodies. You laugh at his ridiculousness, curling into his side as he wraps an arm around your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so daft.\u201d Your words are muffled against the bare skin of his arm, and you feel him press a kiss to the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cYeah but you love me, so it\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d You agree as you peer up to him and shrug.</p><p>He grins again, this time kissing your lips once. \u201cCan we get one?\u201d</p><p>You frown up at him, confused by his question and a little offended he didn\u2019t return your love with words. \u201cCan we get one what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog. Like that one.\u201d He clarifies as he points behind him.</p><p>You follow his gesture, watching as the dog and his owner now converse with someone else new. \u201cYou want a labradoodle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help the little raise of your brows. \u201cSure, if you want. You gonna fob that off on your mum as well?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s expectant expression drops, and for a brief second he looks almost hurt by your words. \u201cSuppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>You finally reach the doors of the arcade on the pier, both of you removing your sunglasses and taking a moment to adjust to the dark room. The noise inside is loud and chaotic, something you\u2019d normally shy away from, but again it only fills you with more nostalgia.</p><p>You practically drag Harry by the wrist to the nearest 2p dispenser, deciding an amount between you to limit yourselves to because otherwise you really will be there all day. You weave your way around the machines, strategically picking out one with a key ring close enough to the edge.</p><p>As you wander around, you notice Harry paying particularly close attention to a bloke on a 10p machine, watching as he lines up two columns of coins and just pushes them into the hole in one swift movement.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of technique is that?\u201d Harry hisses from behind you as you settle on a machine with a cat key ring practically dangling over the edge.</p><p>You glance in the man\u2019s direction, watching as he repeats the action again before looking up to Harry with a horrified expression. \u201cA shit technique, that\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>He smirks, placing a gentle kiss to your temple before handing you a pinch of coins. \u201cShall we show him how it\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>You giggle mischievously and nudge your hip to his. \u201cLess of the dirty talk when we\u2019re in public, please.\u201d</p><p>Harry lingers by your ear as you begin slotting the coins in at the <i>correct</i> time. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Right\u2026 <i>there</i>.\u201d He growls as you drop a coin.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Harry.\u201d You whine quietly, but can\u2019t stop your laughter from bubbling through your lips.</p><p>He watches from behind you as you drop another coin into the machine, grunting lowly in your ear. <i>\u201cUgh, yes.\u201d</i></p><p>Your giggles come harder as he continues to be ridiculous every time you push a 2p in, occasionally losing your pace and wasting a penny.</p><p>You watch as a line of coins fall from the top shelf, both of you staring as the machine pushes the coins into the pile of others, edging the cat key ring and a Spider-Man key ring you hadn\u2019t been paying attention to over the side with a stream of more coins.</p><p>You squeal with delight as you bend down to collect your winnings, piling your coins into the little plastic tub.</p><p>Harry smirks as you stand straight, peering into your tub of coins and picking out the stubborn cat key ring. \u201cMuch better technique if you ask me.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>A/N: in typical Katie fashion, I have gone away for a few days and ended up being proper in my head about Harry. So, I wrote something down real quick to give you a small idea about what I&rsquo;ve been doing on my time off. Special thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRMY0yYTxRHkm07sIyZRgw\">@all-things-fic</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> for being constant inspiration for me to write shit like this. As always - THOUGHTS PLEASE! Xxx</i></b></p><p>You&rsquo;re feeling an exhaustion you&rsquo;re not used to. It&rsquo;s not overworked tiredness or stressed out lethargy, no it&rsquo;s something else entirely. It&rsquo;s a content feeling, one of fulfilled happiness and bliss that even though you don&rsquo;t feel it all too often, over the past few days it&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve felt.</p><p>It&rsquo;s stemmed from walking for miles under the hot sun and sea air, taken between long swings of warm water because your bag is no cooler. It tires your muscles and your mind, but in the most wonderful way. And it hits you around the same time everyday; late afternoon when your day begins to slow down.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve been watching the waves crash against the wall of the beach with the incoming tide for about ten minutes, while carefully tonguing your way around a Mr Whippy, careful not to get your hair stuck in the cream with the unpredictable and mindless wind. The combined sounds of the waves lapping and crashing against the concrete barrier, with squawking seagulls circling above you and bubble of talks from everyone around you fills you with a satisfying nostalgia. You spent a lot of time at seasides like this as a kid, but it&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;ve particularly had time to enjoy as a fully fledged grown up.</p><p>As you finish the small remainder of your ice cream cone, Harry&rsquo;s hand silently slips into yours as he begins to tug you towards the coastal path you&rsquo;ve been secretly putting off. Your legs are tired, and you&rsquo;re about ready to collapse.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, sweets.&rdquo; Harry chuckles at your slight yet obvious resistance. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t walk there won&rsquo;t be any time for 2p machines on the pier.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Jesus, he&rsquo;s always known what to say. </i>His words have you with a spring in your step once again, and you&rsquo;re making it your work to keep in pace beside him.</p><p>&ldquo;How long are you going to let me on the 2p machines though?&rdquo; You challenge childishly, peering up at him with sceptical eyes through your sunglasses.</p><p>&ldquo;As long as you want.&rdquo; He grins down at you, squeezing your hand in his.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a terrible idea - we&rsquo;ll be there all night.&rdquo; You warn with a shake your head.</p><p>&ldquo;I just like seeing you get stroppy when the machine eats the coins.&rdquo;</p><p>You scowl up at him and scoff. &ldquo;I do not get stroppy, thank you.&rdquo; You definitely do get stroppy, you&rsquo;re even contradicting yourself now.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, none a&rsquo;that.&rdquo; He insists, pulling you in front of him so that his chest is flat against your back, his arms crossed over your chest so that admittedly it&rsquo;s difficult to walk. &ldquo;I also like how hilarious you are when you win something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why am I hilarious?&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re met with silence, Harry either thinking too hard on his answer or regretting saying anything in the first place. Regardless of the answer, he&rsquo;s sure to prove himself right in about half an hour.</p><p>You join the concrete coastal path, decorated with a light dusting of sand and the occasional puddle or dark shadow from where a child has exited the sea and dripped their way back to their parent. The sea is on your right, turquoise and glistening under the light of the sun in the gloriously clear blue sky. The sea dances with the reflection, like diamonds have been scattered. If the water were still you might be able to see your reflection.</p><p>All along the beach front are wooden panels that separate equal sized patches of coarse sand plains, each chunk littered with families and couples, and also the occasional dog.</p><p>To your left are the pale chalk cliff sides, lined with warned wooden fences and beds of flowers and weeds. They&rsquo;re topped with grass, occasionally a fence bordering an incredibly well placed abode. The area is notorious for landslides, and you know you would personally never live that close to the edge - you&rsquo;re anxious just thinking about it.</p><p>The walk from Shanklin to Sandown is one not unfamiliar to you, a nice length and plenty to look at on a day as beautiful as today. You&rsquo;ve already walked it once today, Harry having parked the car on Sandown seafront and the two of you taking a leisurely stroll along to Shanklin for fish and chips, ice cream and a round of mini-golf. You&rsquo;d won the mini-golf, and Harry had accused you of cheating - when in fact, he was the one cheating.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been the best weather for an Easter bank holiday weekend for a long time, and apparently the Isle of Wight was the place Harry wanted to spend it with you. No one cares here, the place is living thirty years in the past still, but in such a good way. He hasn&rsquo;t been harassed or stalked once in the four days you&rsquo;ve been here, and as far as the world are concerned he&rsquo;s probably disappeared, or so it would seem.</p><p>You&rsquo;re renting an apartment on Ventnor seafront, right next to The Spyglass pub, and surprisingly quiet considering the footfall it attracts. Every day you&rsquo;ve slept in, sharing breakfast duties before you head out for your daily adventure, which usually consists of a minimum twenty minute car drive with the sun roof open and the music on full volume with Harry&rsquo;s hand in yours between gear changes, followed by a lengthy walk to somewhere for lunch, usually outside fighting off flies with an alcoholic something or other just because you can.</p><p>In the evening you&rsquo;d been eating in the flat, though the first night you did go out somewhere recommended by your friend, but since then it&rsquo;s been light dinners on your balcony with a bottle of wine.</p><p>Just like on your way, every single dog Harry has to stop and stroke and have at least a two minute conversation with the owner; what&rsquo;s its name, what breed is it, how old is it? He just has to know everything. It&rsquo;s quite endearing really, and you do love that about him, but you can see the pier less than five hundred yards away now - it&rsquo;s literally right there, and you&rsquo;re just itching to get inside.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so cute,&rdquo; Harry gushes, crouched down and incredibly smiley as he pets the next dog, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t he cute, love?&rdquo; He asks as he beams up at you.</p><p>You had been too distracted watching a child write a message in the sand just below you, trying to work out what he was actually writing. So far you&rsquo;ve made out &lsquo;chiken nug&rsquo;&hellip; clearly it&rsquo;s going well.</p><p>You glance down to Harry with the labradoodle puppy and smile warmly with a gentle nod. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gorgeous.&rdquo;</p><p>You wait patiently as Harry says goodbye to the owners, you offering a light wave as he retakes your hand and continues walking, swinging your hands wildly between your bodies.
