        "body": "<p>As a Jon fan I would like to\nexplain why I like the Jon x Dany ship.</p><p>Being a Jon fan means that I\nrelate to the character, agree with everything he does and will defend/justify\nhis actions to the very end. I can acknowledge that he has flaws and at the\nsame time try to see things from his POV. </p><p>As a book reader, my favorite Jon\nrelationship is with Arya. I am a sucker for good big brother/little sister \u00a0relationships and Jon-Arya is one of the best sibling\nrelationships present in the book. In fact I would go ahead and say that Jon-Arya\nis the best and most important relationship in the books, period. They love\neach other unconditionally and it\u2019s healthy and all things good. \u00a0I mean, how can folks read things like this:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Needle was Jon Snow\u2019s\nsmile.</i></b><i> <b>He used to mess my hair and call me \u201clittle sister,\u201d she\nremembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.</b></i></p><p><b><i>Bring her home, Mance&hellip; You owe\nme this one little girl. </i></b></p><p><b><i>What do you know of my heart,\npriestess? What do you know of my sister?</i></b></p></blockquote><p>and not love them! I wish they would meet up soon and if there\nis one thing I am desperately looking forward to next season, it\u2019s Jon and Arya\nreuniting again. If D&amp;D mess this up, you can expect me to write long\nranting essays on here about it!</p><p>And well, Jon and Ghost are pretty much about a boy and his dog and I love them to bits. Ghost is a part of Jon and I am glad he is around next season. And I love Jon\u2019s bromance with Sam - best friends forever! <br/></p><p>Now, coming to Jonerys, I knew\nthat Jon/Dany would eventually meet and the books had foreshadowed some sort of\nan alliance between them. My favorite characters have always been Jon and Arya\nand while I liked Dany, I was not exactly all that invested in her story. Until\nlast season that is. </p><p>And man, did I like her last\nseason. The Lannisters have heaped untold misery on the Starks and Westeros for\n7 seasons now and seeing Dany on Drogon and her Dothraki army crush them in\nbattle was orgasmic. I was hoping for her to defeat Cersei/Jaime\nand cursing Tyrion for fucking up everything with his stupid plans.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>And well, I liked Jon and Dany\u2019s\nburgeoning relationship. After two seasons of Sansa constantly telling Jon that\nhe knows nothing and questioning his every\ndecision, it was refreshing to have someone ask Jon for advice!\u00a0 As per\nSophie Turner\u2019s comments at Comic Con \u2013 <i>\u201c[Sansa]\ndoesn\u2019t think he [Jon] has the intellect, the knowledge, and the experience\nthat she has, and I concur</i>.\u201d This reflects in Sansa\u2019s behavior towards Jon\nwhere she thinks that Jon should do as she says because she knows better. </p><p>\n\nBut Jon is an intelligent, pragmatic leader.
