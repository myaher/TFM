I used an app that I have on my kindle to make it!!!</b>)</p><p>The spacecraft you, your husband Stephen, Tony Stark, and Peter Parker aka Spider-Man are in is going to Titan. Where Tony Stark has persuaded you and Stephen to bring the battle to Thanos before he gets to Earth to get the Mind Stone.</p><p>On the hologram in front of you, you see the surface of the barren planet, called Titan, that you assume was once Thanos&rsquo; home or something along that line. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; asks Peter from behind you, Stephen and Stark. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re here&hellip;&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this rig has a self-park function.&rdquo; says Stark as he turns away from the screen to Peter. &ldquo;Get your hand inside this steering gimbal. Close those around it.&rdquo; he says to Peter closing the metal clasps around his hand as he does. Peter does the same. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; Stark asks. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Peter answers. &ldquo;We got to move it at the same time.&rdquo; Stark says. &ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo; says Peter waiting for the right moment to move his arm. The ship gets closer and closer to a giant star-shaped ship. You grab onto Stephen&rsquo;s arm in worry. He looks back at Stark and Peter. &ldquo;Turn! Turn! Turn!&rdquo; says Peter. You turn to see Stark&rsquo;s armor cover his face as they make the ship turn. They only turn it so much that the ship still hits the ship. &ldquo;Oh boy&hellip;&rdquo; you say as you and Stephen make shields to make the impact for the 4 of you less harmful. The ship breaks in half and the segment that the 4 of you are in lands on the ground.</p><!-- more --><p>Stephen turns to you as he gets to his feet. &ldquo;(Y/N). You alright?&rdquo; he asks as he helps you to your feet. &ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m alright.&rdquo; you say. He nods and walks over to Stark to help him up. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; Stephen asks as he helps him up. &ldquo;That was close.&rdquo; says Stark making Stephen nod. &ldquo;I owe you one.&rdquo; Stark says patting Stephen&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Let me just say,&rdquo; says a voice from behind you that makes you jump. You turn around to see Peter hanging upside down on a web. &ldquo;If aliens, wind up planting eggs in my chest or something and I eat 1 of you, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I do not want another single pop-culture reference out of you for the rest of the trip, you understand?&rdquo; Stark asks sternly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to say that something is coming.&rdquo; says Peter as he points behind him.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when a small metal ball rolls in between the 4 of you, making all 4 of you to look down at it. Then it explodes making the 4 of you go in different directions. You land next to Stephen with a grunt. You slowly sit up just in time to see 4 figures walk into the room. You see 1 of the figures turn to you and Stephen. &ldquo;Thanos!&rdquo; he yells as he throws 2 knives at the 2 of you. You easily block them with a shield, protecting you and Stephen from the knives. The figure yells in anger and that&rsquo;s when the cloak of levitation wraps around his head making him fall back trying to get it off. &ldquo;Thanks for that.&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;Your welcome.&rdquo; you say with a wink before running over to help Stark. You run over to where the masked figure is and throw a ball of energy at him. He turns to you, aiming his blasters at you. &ldquo;Well, hello beautiful.&rdquo; he says lowering his blasters. You glare at him before throwing 2 balls of energy at him. They hit him making him fly backward. &ldquo;Never gonna happen, hotshot!&rdquo; you say before turning to Stark who&rsquo;s suit is magnetized to the metal of the ship. &ldquo;Hold still.&rdquo; you tell him. He nods and doesn&rsquo;t move as you make a sword between the metal and his suit. You slide the sword in between the 2 and separate them. Stark stumbles before turning to you and nodding. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; you nod toward the battle taking place. He nods and picks you up by the waist, taking you to the man that&rsquo;s currently fighting the cloak. &ldquo;Die blanket of death!&rdquo; yells the man yanking the cloak off of his head. Stark lands in front of him and places a foot on his chest aiming his pulsar at him while you aim your sword at the masked figure who is now holding Peter captive with a blaster pointed at his head. &ldquo;Everybody stay where you are! Chill the F out!&rdquo; the masked figure says. He presses a button on the side of his mask making it disappear revealing his face. He turns to where you and Stark stand pointing his blaster at the 2 of you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask you this one time, where is Gamora?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll do you 1 better,&rdquo; says Stark as his helmet disappears. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Gamora?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do you 1 better,&rdquo; says the man that Stark&rsquo;s holding down. &ldquo;Why is Gamora!&rdquo; he says.</p><p>The man holding Peter turns to Stephen. &ldquo;Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I&rsquo;m gonna French fry this little freak.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; yells Stark. &ldquo;You shoot my guy, and I&rsquo;ll blast him! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; he yells making the blaster on his hand bigger. &ldquo;Do it Quill! I can take it.&rdquo; says the man under Stark. &ldquo;No! He can&rsquo;t take it!&rdquo; yells a squeaky voice making you turn and see what looks like a girl with antennae on her head all tangled up by Peter&rsquo;s webs. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right. He can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; says Stephen, making you nod in agreement. &ldquo;Oh yeah, you don&rsquo;t want to tell me where she is? That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll kill all 4 of you, and I&rsquo;ll beat it out of Thanos myself. Starting with you!&rdquo; he says pressing his blaster harder into Peter&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Wait, Thanos?&rdquo; Stephen asks confused. &ldquo;Alright, let me ask this 1 time. What master do you serve?&rdquo; Stephen asks. &ldquo;<i>\u2019What master do I serve\u2019</i>?&rdquo; asks the man holding Peter. &ldquo;What am I supposed to say? Jesus?&rdquo; he asks sarcastically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re from Earth.&rdquo; says Stark pointing out the obvious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not from Earth. I&rsquo;m from Missouri.&rdquo; says the man glaring intensely at Stark. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s on Earth, dipshit. What are you housing on us for?&rdquo; Stark asks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not with Thanos?&rdquo; Peter asks. &ldquo;<i>\u2019With Thanos\u2019</i>?!&rdquo; the man holding him asks. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m here to kill Thanos. He took my girl- Wait! Who are you?!&rdquo; he asks looking at the 4 of you. Peter&rsquo;s helmet goes down. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Avengers, man.&rdquo; says Peter making the man take his arm away from his neck as he sighs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the ones Thor told us about!&rdquo; says the girl making you and Stark turn to her. &ldquo;You know Thor?!&rdquo; Stark asks in surprise. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; the guy next to Peter says while nodding. &ldquo;Tall guy, not that good looking, needed saving.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; you ask him.</p><hr><p>You&rsquo;re now by The Guardian&rsquo;s ship trying to think of a plan for when Thanos shows up. &ldquo;What the hell happened to this planet? It&rsquo;s 8 degrees off its axis, gravitational pull is all over the place.&rdquo; says Quill as he uses some kind of meter. &ldquo;Yeah, we got 1 advantage. He&rsquo;s coming to us. We&rsquo;ll use it.&rdquo; says Stark before turning to you and the others. &ldquo;Alright, I have a plan.&rdquo; he says as he walks over to where you and the others stand. &ldquo;Or at least the beginnings of one. It&rsquo;s pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don&rsquo;t wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.&rdquo; Stark says before turning to Drax who&rsquo;s yawning. &ldquo;Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I&rsquo;m breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?&rdquo; Stark asks him. &ldquo;I stopped listening after you said, <i>&lsquo;We need a plan.&rsquo;</i>&rdquo; says Drax. &ldquo;Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.&rdquo; says Stark as he turns to Peter Quill or as he likes to call himself - Star-Lord. &ldquo;See, <i>'not winging it&rsquo;</i> isn&rsquo;t really what they do.&rdquo; says Quill. &ldquo;Uh, what exactly is it that they do?&rdquo; Peter asks as he points toward Mantis and Drax. &ldquo;Kick names, take ass.&rdquo; says Mantis. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; says Drax agreeing with Mantis as he turns to you, Peter and Stark. Tony is silent for a moment and you turn to him to see what he&rsquo;s going to say. &ldquo;All right, just get over here, please.&rdquo; he says to them. He turns to Quill. &ldquo;Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?&rdquo; he asks. Quill chuckles. &ldquo;<i>'Mr. Lord.&rsquo;</i> Star-Lord is fine.&rdquo; he says nodding at Mantis and Drax to come over. &ldquo;We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude&hellip;&rdquo; Stark says but Quill interrupts him. &ldquo;Dude, don&rsquo;t call us plucky. We don&rsquo;t know what it means.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;re optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan&hellip; and that way it might be really good.&rdquo; he continues making you roll your eyes and sigh in annoyance. &ldquo;Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.&rdquo; says Drax. &ldquo;What dance-off?&rdquo; you ask confused. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; says Quill shaking his head. &ldquo;Like in Footloose, the movie?&rdquo; Peter asks confused.</p><p>Quill perks up at that. &ldquo;Exactly like Footloose.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Is it still the greatest movie in history?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;It never was.&rdquo; says Peter shaking his head making Quill squint his eyes at him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage this, all right?&rdquo; Stark asks turning to Peter. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting no help - from Flash Gordon here.&rdquo; says Stark. &ldquo;<i>\u2019Flash Gordon\u2019</i>?&rdquo; Quill asks as he walks toward Peter and Tony. &ldquo;By the way, that&rsquo;s a compliment.&rdquo; he says making Stark and Peter turn to him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, I&rsquo;m half human.&rdquo; says Quill. &ldquo;So that 50% of me that&rsquo;s stupid&hellip;&rdquo; he continues making Stark nod slightly as if queuing him to continue. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s 100% you.&rdquo; Quill pointing his finger at Stark. &ldquo;Your math is blowing my mind.&rdquo; says Stark. &ldquo;Alright, guys, Enough. We don&rsquo;t need to-&rdquo; you say before Mantis interrupts you by saying. &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo; You all turn to her. &ldquo;But does your friend often do that?&rdquo; she asks pointing toward Stephen who has been meditating on a rock away from you and the others. Your eyes widen when you see his head moving rapidly. &ldquo;Strange, you all right?&rdquo; Stark asks as you rush over to your husband. &ldquo;Stephen! Stephen wake up.&rdquo; you say as you get to him. </p><p>He breaks out of his trance, falling to the ground, breathing heavily. You grab his arm to keep him from falling forward. &ldquo;Hey. You&rsquo;re okay Stephen. You&rsquo;re back. You&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo; you say to him as you look into his green eyes. He instantly starts to calm down. &ldquo;Hey, what was that?&rdquo; Peter asks from behind you. &ldquo;I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.&rdquo; says Stephen. &ldquo;How many did you see?&rdquo; you ask softly. &ldquo;14,000,605.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;How many did we win?&rdquo; asks Stark. Stephen looks up at the others and then looks back at you. &ldquo;One.&rdquo; he says making your eyes widen. <i>'Oh, shit.&rsquo;</i> you think.</p><hr><p>You watch from your hiding place behind where Stephen currently sits on a boulder as a portal opens up and who you assume is Thanos walks out of it. You watch as he looks around the barren landscape around him seeing the crashed ship you and the others used to get here. &ldquo;Oh, yeah.&rdquo; Stephen says making Thanos turn to see him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re much more of a Thanos.&rdquo; he says. Thanos looks at the ship again. &ldquo;I take it the Maw is dead.&rdquo; he says referring to the creepy squid guy that captured Stephen and caused you and the others to be here in the first place. You see Stephen nod at Thanos&rsquo; statement. Thanos turns to Stephen again and begins walking toward him. &ldquo;This day extracts a heavy toll.&rdquo; he says. He looks at the eye of Agamotto where he thinks the Time Stone is located. &ldquo;Still, he accomplished his mission.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.&rdquo; says Stephen. &ldquo;And where do you think he brought you?&rdquo; Thanos asks. &ldquo;Let me guess.&rdquo; says Stephen as he looks around. &ldquo;Your home?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>Thanos stops, putting one his foot on a boulder as he looks at the ground. He looks up again. &ldquo;It was.&rdquo; he says before clenching his and activating the Reality Stone to make the surroundings disappear and appear as if Titan is still inhabited. &ldquo;And it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.&rdquo; says Thanos. &ldquo;Genocide.&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted, came to pass.&rdquo; says Thanos making the illusion disappear. &ldquo;Congratulations, you&rsquo;re a prophet.&rdquo; says Stephen sarcastically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a survivor.&rdquo; says Thanos making you want to make a snide remark. &ldquo;Who wants to murder <i>trillions</i>.&rdquo; says Stephen. &ldquo;With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.&rdquo; Thanos says snapping his fingers to demonstrate what he plans to do. &ldquo;They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Stephen stands up from the boulder and starts walking toward him. You get ready to engage if you need to. &ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d finally rest&hellip; and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.&rdquo; Thanos says. &ldquo;The hardest choices require the strongest wills.&rdquo; he says as he looks down at the ground as if thinking about something. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find our will equal to yours.&rdquo; Stephen says forming his shields as he speaks. Thanos looks up at him. &ldquo;<i>\u2019Our\u2019</i>?&rdquo; he asks. That&rsquo;s when he looks up to see Stark flying down with a giant piece of rock. He raises the gauntlet up ready to destroy it with the Power stone, but he can&rsquo;t because it crashes into him. &ldquo;Piece of cake, Quill.&rdquo; you hear Stark say as he flies past Quill. &ldquo;Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.&rdquo; says Quill before pressing the button behind is ear making his helmet appear and the rockets on his boots to activate. A purple cloud of energy comes from where Thanos was crushed with the rock. You hear him yell in anger before the pieces of the rock turns into bats that start flying toward Stark making him fly away, trying to get away. &ldquo;Peter go!&rdquo; you yell. You see him shoot a web at Thanos, hitting him in the eye making him not see Drax as he attacks his legs with his daggers. You create a portal to teleport over to where Thanos is and just as you exit the portal Stephen exits his own portal. You both begin conjuring weapons and then begin attacking Thanos. You see Quill fly toward you and the others just as Thanos knocks you and Drax away from him. You roll onto your side with a grunt. </p><p>You look up just as Stephen swings his sword at Thanos but Thanos catches the blade in his hand in mid-swing. He holds it still with his free hand before yanking the web Peter shot at him earlier off of his face with his other hand. He glares at Stephen before making the blade disappear and then kicking Stephen away from him. Stephen easily catches himself with the help of his cloak. Quill shoots his blasters at Thanos as he makes his way over to him making the Titan fire at him with the Power Stone. Stephen makes platforms for him to step on as he gets closer. Quill flips over Thanos placing what looks like a bomb on his back. Thanos turns to Quill just as he flips him off. You open a portal for him to jump through. &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; he says as he jumps through the portal.</p><p>The bomb goes off making Thanos go down to his knees. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him close his fist.&rdquo; you hear Stephen say to the cloak. The cloak flies over to Thanos, wrapping around the gauntlet so that he can&rsquo;t make a fist. Stephen creates a portal and Peter jumps out of it. &ldquo;Magic.&rdquo; he says as he hits Thanos before going through another portal. &ldquo;More magic.&rdquo; he says as he comes out of another portal. &ldquo;Magic with a kick.&rdquo; he says kicking Thanos in the face. He comes through the fourth portal. &ldquo;Magic with a&hellip;&rdquo; he says but Thanos wraps his hand around his throat throwing him down onto the ground. &ldquo;<i>Insect!</i>&rdquo; Thanos growls at him before throwing him away from him and into Stephen making them both hit the ground. You rush over to them. &ldquo;You 2 alright?&rdquo; you ask as you kneel down next to Peter who had the hardest impact out of the 2 of them. </p><p>Before either of them can reply you hear an explosion behind you. You turn to see Stark firing multiple bombs at Thanos. Thanos then uses the Space stone to absorb the fire before shooting it back at Stark making Stark crash into what looks like a spaceship. You then see Peter swing behind Thanos and shoot a web at his hand pulling on it to keep Thanos in one place and not use the gauntlet. Thanos pulls against the web hitting Peter in the face before pulling the web off the gauntlet. He start to turn around when a ship crashes into him. When Thanos stops moving you see him get covered by 2 pieces of metal. He gets up to his feet, pushing the metal off him. You see a figure climb out of the ship before jumping up and attacking Thanos. <i>'This must be Nebula, Gamora&rsquo;s sister.&rsquo;</i> You think as Nebula pulls out a sword getting ready to attack again. Thanos smirks as he looks up at her. &ldquo;Well, well, well.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve killed me.&rdquo; Nebula growls at him. &ldquo;It would&rsquo;ve been a waste of parts!&rdquo; Thanos exclaims. Nebula grits her teeth before attacking him. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Gamora?&rdquo; she asks him angrily. Thanos doesn&rsquo;t answer, he just hits her with his arm making her go backwards and onto a pile of metal.</p><p>You and Stephen stand on a structure looking down at Thanos. You both conjure whips of melted metal and throw them at Thanos and making them wrap the gauntlet. Thanos struggles against the hot metal. Drax slides in behind him, kicking his leg. Quill fires a magnet to immobilize his other arm. And Peter attaches a web to his chest. You and Stephen remove the metal from the gauntlet when Stark flies over to him, grabbing the gauntlet to try and get it off. Thanos struggles against Peter and the others. Peter activates his spider legs to make him stay in one place. Once Thanos is steady you conjure a portal for Mantis to jump through. She jumps through the portal landing on Thanos&rsquo; shoulders. She places her hands on the sides of his head trying to put him under her control. Thanos yells in anger just before he goes still, signaling that he&rsquo;s under Mantis&rsquo;s control. &ldquo;Is he under? Don&rsquo;t let up.&rdquo; says Stark as he tries to get the Gauntlet off of his hand. &ldquo;Be quick. He is very strong.&rdquo; says Mantis. &ldquo;Parker, help!&rdquo; Stark calls making Peter run over to him. You then wrap metal around his chest to keep him in place. &ldquo;Get over here. She can&rsquo;t hold him much longer. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Stark says to Peter as they both begin to pull on the gauntlet.</p><p>Quill lands behind you and then turns to Thanos with a smug smile. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be hard to catch. For the record, this was my plan.&rdquo; he says pointing a finger at Stark. He walks closer to Thanos. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so strong now, huh?&rdquo; he asks Thanos. &ldquo;Where is Gamora?&rdquo; he asks softly but with some sternness in his voice. &ldquo;My Gamora.&rdquo; Thanos says. &ldquo;No, bullshit!&rdquo; Quill exclaims. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he asks angrily. &ldquo;He is in anguish.&rdquo; says Mantis making Quill look up at her. He looks back at Thanos. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; he says smugly. &ldquo;He&hellip; He mourns.&rdquo; says Mantis. &ldquo;What does this monster have to mourn?&rdquo; Drax asks as he keeps a hold on Thanos&rsquo; leg. &ldquo;Gamora.&rdquo; you hear Nebula say softly. Quill turns to her. <i>'Oh no.&rsquo;</i> you think. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asks her softly. &ldquo;He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone. But she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nebula says. &ldquo;Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?&rdquo; Stark asks Quill as he still tries to get the Gauntlet off Thanos&rsquo; hand.</p><p>Quill slowly turns to Thanos, anger and sadness in his eyes. &ldquo;Quill, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; you say sternly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t engage. We almost got this off!&rdquo; says Stark but Quill ignores both of your warnings by asking. &ldquo;Tell me she&rsquo;s lying.&rdquo; he says sternly. Thanos doesn&rsquo;t answer. &ldquo;Asshole, tell me you didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; Quill yells. &ldquo;Quill.&rdquo; you say sternly. &ldquo;I had to.&rdquo; Thanos groans out. &ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t. No, you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Quill says at the brink of tears. &ldquo;Quill.&rdquo; you say trying to make him look at you. He ignores you and his face contorts into anger and he starts hitting Thanos in the face with his blaster. &ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he exclaims as he continues to hit him and making Mantis let go of his head. Stark rushes over to him. &ldquo;Quill!&rdquo; he says grabbing his arm to make him stop. &ldquo;Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!&rdquo; he exclaims. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming, it&rsquo;s coming. I got it, I got it!&rdquo; says Peter as he continues to pull on the gauntlet. He almost gets it off when Thanos headbutts Mantis and yanks the gauntlet away from Peter. He grabs Mantis and throws her off of him. &ldquo;Oh, God.&rdquo; says Peter as he gets up and jumps to catch her. You see him land with the spider legs protecting the 2 of them. Thanos then kicks Drax off of his leg making him knock into Quill, Nebula and Stark, leaving you and Stephen still holding onto him with your ropes of melted metal. He then yanks you 2 into the air away from him. </p><p>You both land in the rubble hard. You groan in pain as you try to get up. You turn your head to see Stephen laying next to you. You crawl over to him. &ldquo;Stephen.&rdquo; you say softly. &ldquo;Stephen, wake up.&rdquo; you say shaking his shoulder. He groans in response letting you know that he&rsquo;s okay. You look back at the battle to see Thanos using the space stone to make the planet he&rsquo;s pointing at come down in several large meteors toward Stark. You see Stark try to fly away only to be blocked by a large meteorite and crashing into the ground. You create a shield around you and Stephen to protect the 2 of you from the meteors. As you hold the shield up Stephen sits up and looks around. &ldquo;Well, that didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; he says before looking at you. &ldquo;Yeah, no kidding.&rdquo; you say before a pretty large meteor hits your shield making you grunt as you hold the shield up.</p><p>Once the meteors stop landing near the 2 of you, you both get up and run to where Thanos is. You both stand on the rock staring at him for a moment before conjuring shields and slamming them to the ground making a lightning bolt that bounces against rocks that are floating to where Thanos stands. Thanos jumps off the rock just before the lightning strike hits him. As he&rsquo;s in the air he uses the Power Stone and shoots it at the 2 of you. Stephen makes a shield of glass stopping the blast from hitting the 2 of you. He pushes the glass toward Thanos. Thanos puts his fist to the glass shattering it before using the Space Stone to suck the glass in and shoot at you and Stephen in a funnel shape ball of energy. You conjure a ball of magic in your hands before making a shield to protect the 2 of you, making the funnel turn into butterflies. &ldquo;Go and help the others.&rdquo; Stephen says as Thanos looks at the butterflies in confusion. You nod and run to where the others are.</p><p>As you help the others out of the webs Peter put them in you turn and see multiple duplicates of Stephen surrounding Thanos. The duplicates conjure up whips and wrap them around Thanos&rsquo; body. You see Thanos close his fist and him using the Power Stone to reveal the real Stephen. He pulls Stephen closer to him by using the Space Stone and Reality Stone. You turn to Peter and the others who nod at you to go help him. You runs as fast as you can toward Thanos and Stephen. Thanos grabs Stephen&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re full of tricks, wizard.&rdquo; Thanos growls making Stephen struggle against his grip. He grabs the eye of Agamotto breaks the chain making Stephen yell. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.&rdquo; Thanos crushes it in his hand only to find that the stone isn&rsquo;t in the eye. &ldquo;<i>A fake.</i>&rdquo; he growls at him before throwing Stephen away from him. You watch as Stephen lands on the ground hitting his head on the ground hard. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; you scream. You turn to Thanos and charge out of anger. You swing your sword that you conjure up out of magic at him only for him to catch it in his hand. He grins at you as he begins to close his fist. You gulp in fear of what Stone he&rsquo;ll use to kill you, but he&rsquo;s not able to close his fist because a piece of metal stops him from doing so. You hear Stark land behind you and you breath out in relief. &ldquo;You throw another moon at me, and I&rsquo;m gonna lose it.&rdquo; Stark says from behind you. &ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Thanos says as he throws you off to the side making you hit the ground. &ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; Stark asks. &ldquo;I do. You&rsquo;re not the only one cursed with knowledge.&rdquo; says Thanos. &ldquo;My only curse is you.&rdquo; says Stark before deploying multiple rockets from his back. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; exclaims Thanos. </p><p>As they fight you get up and rush over to Stephen. &ldquo;Stephen.&rdquo; you say as you kneel down next to him. You shake his shoulder to wake him up. He doesn&rsquo;t move and you see blood trickling from head. &ldquo;Stephen. Stephen, wake up.&rdquo; you plead as you continue to shake him. He doesn&rsquo;t move so you look up at the battle taking place in front of you to see Stark form a large blade out of his armor as he uses his other arm to block the gauntlet from hitting him. He makes a move to stab him in the stomach but Thanos grabs the blade in his hand before breaking it and stabbing Stark in the stomach. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; you scream as you see Stark gasping for air as the blade goes through his body. Thanos back him up to where he sits down on a piece of rubble and puts his hand on his head to make Stark look at him. &ldquo;You have my respect, Stark. When I&rsquo;m done, half of humanity will still be alive.&rdquo; Thanos says to him before pushing him away and standing up straight. &ldquo;I hope they remember you.&rdquo; he says as he points the gauntlet at him, ready to use all four of the stones to kill him. You get ready to get up and save Stark but the voice of your husband, as well as a hand grabbing your wrist stops you. &ldquo;Stop.&rdquo; You turn to see Stephen sitting up now. &ldquo;Spare his life&hellip;&rdquo; he says making Stark look at him. &ldquo;And I will give you the stone.&rdquo; he says making you look at him in surprise. &ldquo;No tricks.&rdquo; Thanos says. Stephen shakes his head making Thanos turn the gauntlet on him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Stark says but Stephen begins to raise his hand. &ldquo;Stephen&hellip;&rdquo; you say softly. He turns to you. &ldquo;Trust me&hellip;&rdquo; he says softly.</p><p>As you look into his green eyes, you have to trust him on this. He summons the stone holding it in between his index finger and thumb. Thanos raises his free hand and Stephen makes the stone float over to him, landing in his hand. You all watch as Thanos puts the stone into the gauntlet. He looks down at the circle on the back of his hand where the mind stone is supposed to go and smiles. &ldquo;One to go.&rdquo; he says before 2 lasers hit the gauntlet making him look up to where Quill is flying toward him. You watch as Thanos summons a portal as Quill continues to shoot him, disappearing and going who knows where. Quill lands on the ground before pressing the button deactivating his helmet. He turns around and points his blaster in front of him. &ldquo;Where is he?!&rdquo; he yells as he looks around as if Thanos will appear again. You see Stark spray a substance into his wound to keep him alive. Quill&rsquo;s eyes widen in surprise. &ldquo;Did we just lose?&rdquo; he asks. Stark turns to Stephen. &ldquo;Why would you do that?&rdquo; he asks softly. Stephen gulps before replying. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the endgame now.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>You sit next to Stephen, placing your head on his shoulder as Peter helps Tony to his feet and the others gather around the 2 of you. You then feel a change in the atmosphere, as if something bad is happening. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo; says Mantis proving your thought. A second later, she turns to ash making you and the others look at where she stood with wide eyes. You see Drax&rsquo;s hand start to turn into dust. He looks up at Quill. &ldquo;Quill?&rdquo; he asks before his entire body turns into ash. Quill turns toward Tony, who steps forward. &ldquo;Steady, Quill.&rdquo; he says. Your eyes widen as he too starts turning into ash. &ldquo;Oh, man.&rdquo; he says softly before disappearing completely. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; (Y/N)&hellip; There was no other way&hellip;&rdquo; says Stephen as you and Stark turn to look at him. Stephen turns to you and smiles softly at you. &ldquo;I love you (Y/N).&rdquo; he says. You smile sadly back. &ldquo;I love you, too Stephen.&rdquo; He raises his left hand up to your cheek, caressing his cheek gently. You stare into his eyes before he quickly pulls you into a kiss, his hand still on your cheek.</p><p>You slowly pull away a couple moments later, your eyes widening immediately when you see Stephen turn to dust in front of you, some dust settling where your husband sat seconds ago&hellip; On the skin of your cheek you feel something. You brush your fingertips against your cheek and look down at your hand to see ash on your fingertips. You let out a small gasp as you glance at the ground to see something shiny. You pick up the small object and tears start to stream down your cheeks when you see what the small object is. Stephen&rsquo;s wedding ring. You put your free hand over your mouth as you sob uncontrollably.</p><p>When the tears slow down you turn just in time to see Peter disappear as well, leaving just you, Nebula and Tony. Tony&rsquo;s shoulders slump in sadness as he looks at his hand, looking at the ash Peter had left on it. &ldquo;He did it.&rdquo; you hear Nebula say softly. You get up to your feet and walk over to Tony. He looks up at you with tears in his eyes. You give him your hand to help him up. He takes it and you pull him up. As he stands up he wraps his arms around you and cries into your shoulder. You hug him back, also crying over the loss of Stephen and the others.</p><hr><p>As you, Nebula and Tony plan on how to get back to Earth you glare at the ground. <i>'Thanos, you will pay for what you&rsquo;ve done to my husband, my friends and all the other people you\u2019ve killed.&rsquo;</i></p>",

You turn around to see Peter hanging upside down on a web. \u201cIf aliens, wind up planting eggs in my chest or something and I eat 1 of you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d he says. \u201cI do not want another single pop-culture reference out of you for the rest of the trip, you understand?\u201d Stark asks sternly. \u201cI\u2019m trying to say that something is coming.\u201d says Peter as he points behind him.</p><p>That\u2019s when a small metal ball rolls in between the 4 of you, making all 4 of you to look down at it. Then it explodes making the 4 of you go in different directions. You land next to Stephen with a grunt. You slowly sit up just in time to see 4 figures walk into the room. You see 1 of the figures turn to you and Stephen. \u201cThanos!\u201d he yells as he throws 2 knives at the 2 of you. You easily block them with a shield, protecting you and Stephen from the knives. The figure yells in anger and that\u2019s when the cloak of levitation wraps around his head making him fall back trying to get it off. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d Stephen says. \u201cYour welcome.\u201d you say with a wink before running over to help Stark. You run over to where the masked figure is and throw a ball of energy at him. He turns to you, aiming his blasters at you. \u201cWell, hello beautiful.\u201d he says lowering his blasters. You glare at him before throwing 2 balls of energy at him. They hit him making him fly backward. \u201cNever gonna happen, hotshot!\u201d you say before turning to Stark who\u2019s suit is magnetized to the metal of the ship. \u201cHold still.\u201d you tell him. He nods and doesn\u2019t move as you make a sword between the metal and his suit. You slide the sword in between the 2 and separate them. Stark stumbles before turning to you and nodding. \u201cThanks.\u201d \u201cNo problem.\u201d you say. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d you nod toward the battle taking place. He nods and picks you up by the waist, taking you to the man that\u2019s currently fighting the cloak. \u201cDie blanket of death!\u201d yells the man yanking the cloak off of his head. Stark lands in front of him and places a foot on his chest aiming his pulsar at him while you aim your sword at the masked figure who is now holding Peter captive with a blaster pointed at his head. \u201cEverybody stay where you are! Chill the F out!\u201d the masked figure says. He presses a button on the side of his mask making it disappear revealing his face. He turns to where you and Stark stand pointing his blaster at the 2 of you. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you this one time, where is Gamora?\u201d he asks. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do you 1 better,\u201d says Stark as his helmet disappears. \u201cWho\u2019s Gamora?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019ll do you 1 better,\u201d says the man that Stark\u2019s holding down. \u201cWhy is Gamora!\u201d he says.</p><p>The man holding Peter turns to Stephen. \u201cTell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I\u2019m gonna French fry this little freak.\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d yells Stark. \u201cYou shoot my guy, and I\u2019ll blast him! Let\u2019s go!\u201d he yells making the blaster on his hand bigger. \u201cDo it Quill! I can take it.\u201d says the man under Stark. \u201cNo! He can\u2019t take it!\u201d yells a squeaky voice making you turn and see what looks like a girl with antennae on her head all tangled up by Peter\u2019s webs. \u201cShe\u2019s right. He can\u2019t.\u201d says Stephen, making you nod in agreement. \u201cOh yeah, you don\u2019t want to tell me where she is? That\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll kill all 4 of you, and I\u2019ll beat it out of Thanos myself. Starting with you!\u201d he says pressing his blaster harder into Peter\u2019s head. \u201cWait, Thanos?\u201d Stephen asks confused. \u201cAlright, let me ask this 1 time. What master do you serve?\u201d Stephen asks. \u201c<i>\u2019What master do I serve\u2019</i>?\u201d asks the man holding Peter. \u201cWhat am I supposed to say? Jesus?\u201d he asks sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019re from Earth.\u201d says Stark pointing out the obvious. \u201cI\u2019m not from Earth. I\u2019m from Missouri.\u201d says the man glaring intensely at Stark. \u201cThat\u2019s on Earth, dipshit. What are you housing on us for?\u201d Stark asks. \u201cYou\u2019re not with Thanos?\u201d Peter asks. \u201c<i>\u2019With Thanos\u2019</i>?!\u201d the man holding him asks. \u201cNo. I\u2019m here to kill Thanos. He took my girl- Wait! Who are you?!\u201d he asks looking at the 4 of you. Peter\u2019s helmet goes down. \u201cWe\u2019re the Avengers, man.\u201d says Peter making the man take his arm away from his neck as he sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re the ones Thor told us about!\u201d says the girl making you and Stark turn to her. \u201cYou know Thor?!\u201d Stark asks in surprise. \u201cYeah.\u201d the guy next to Peter says while nodding. \u201cTall guy, not that good looking, needed saving.\u201d he says. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d you ask him.</p><hr><p>You\u2019re now by The Guardian\u2019s ship trying to think of a plan for when Thanos shows up. \u201cWhat the hell happened to this planet? It\u2019s 8 degrees off its axis, gravitational pull is all over the place.\u201d says Quill as he uses some kind of meter. \u201cYeah, we got 1 advantage. He\u2019s coming to us. We\u2019ll use it.\u201d says Stark before turning to you and the others. \u201cAlright, I have a plan.\u201d he says as he walks over to where you and the others stand. \u201cOr at least the beginnings of one. It\u2019s pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don\u2019t wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.\u201d Stark says before turning to Drax who\u2019s yawning. \u201cAre you yawning? In the middle of this, while I\u2019m breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?\u201d Stark asks him. \u201cI stopped listening after you said, <i>\u2018We need a plan.\u2019</i>\u201d says Drax. \u201cOkay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.\u201d says Stark as he turns to Peter Quill or as he likes to call himself - Star-Lord. \u201cSee, <i>'not winging it\u2019</i> isn\u2019t really what they do.\u201d says Quill. \u201cUh, what exactly is it that they do?\u201d Peter asks as he points toward Mantis and Drax. \u201cKick names, take ass.\u201d says Mantis. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d says Drax agreeing with Mantis as he turns to you, Peter and Stark. Tony is silent for a moment and you turn to him to see what he\u2019s going to say. \u201cAll right, just get over here, please.\u201d he says to them. He turns to Quill. \u201cMr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?\u201d he asks. Quill chuckles. \u201c<i>'Mr. Lord.\u2019</i> Star-Lord is fine.\u201d he says nodding at Mantis and Drax to come over. \u201cWe gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude\u2026\u201d Stark says but Quill interrupts him. \u201cDude, don\u2019t call us plucky. We don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d he says. \u201cAll right, we\u2019re optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan\u2026 and that way it might be really good.\u201d he continues making you roll your eyes and sigh in annoyance. \u201cTell him about the dance-off to save the universe.\u201d says Drax. \u201cWhat dance-off?\u201d you ask confused. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d says Quill shaking his head. \u201cLike in Footloose, the movie?\u201d Peter asks confused.</p><p>Quill perks up at that. \u201cExactly like Footloose.\u201d he says. \u201cIs it still the greatest movie in history?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt never was.\u201d says Peter shaking his head making Quill squint his eyes at him. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage this, all right?\u201d Stark asks turning to Peter. \u201cOkay.\u201d says Peter. \u201cWe\u2019re getting no help - from Flash Gordon here.\u201d says Stark. \u201c<i>\u2019Flash Gordon\u2019</i>?\u201d Quill asks as he walks toward Peter and Tony. \u201cBy the way, that\u2019s a compliment.\u201d he says making Stark and Peter turn to him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I\u2019m half human.\u201d says Quill. \u201cSo that 50% of me that\u2019s stupid\u2026\u201d he continues making Stark nod slightly as if queuing him to continue. \u201cThat\u2019s 100% you.\u201d Quill pointing his finger at Stark. \u201cYour math is blowing my mind.\u201d says Stark. \u201cAlright, guys, Enough. We don\u2019t need to-\u201d you say before Mantis interrupts you by saying. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d You all turn to her. \u201cBut does your friend often do that?\u201d she asks pointing toward Stephen who has been meditating on a rock away from you and the others. Your eyes widen when you see his head moving rapidly. \u201cStrange, you all right?\u201d Stark asks as you rush over to your husband. \u201cStephen! Stephen wake up.\u201d you say as you get to him. </p><p>He breaks out of his trance, falling to the ground, breathing heavily. You grab his arm to keep him from falling forward. \u201cHey. You\u2019re okay Stephen. You\u2019re back. You\u2019re alright.\u201d you say to him as you look into his green eyes. He instantly starts to calm down. \u201cHey, what was that?\u201d Peter asks from behind you. \u201cI went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.\u201d says Stephen. \u201cHow many did you see?\u201d you ask softly. \u201c14,000,605.\u201d he says. \u201cHow many did we win?\u201d asks Stark. Stephen looks up at the others and then looks back at you. \u201cOne.\u201d he says making your eyes widen. <i>'Oh, shit.\u2019</i> you think.</p><hr><p>You watch from your hiding place behind where Stephen currently sits on a boulder as a portal opens up and who you assume is Thanos walks out of it. You watch as he looks around the barren landscape around him seeing the crashed ship you and the others used to get here. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Stephen says making Thanos turn to see him. \u201cYou\u2019re much more of a Thanos.\u201d he says. Thanos looks at the ship again. \u201cI take it the Maw is dead.\u201d he says referring to the creepy squid guy that captured Stephen and caused you and the others to be here in the first place. You see Stephen nod at Thanos\u2019 statement. Thanos turns to Stephen again and begins walking toward him. \u201cThis day extracts a heavy toll.\u201d he says. He looks at the eye of Agamotto where he thinks the Time Stone is located. \u201cStill, he accomplished his mission.\u201d he says. \u201cYou may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.\u201d says Stephen. \u201cAnd where do you think he brought you?\u201d Thanos asks. \u201cLet me guess.\u201d says Stephen as he looks around. \u201cYour home?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Thanos stops, putting one his foot on a boulder as he looks at the ground. He looks up again. \u201cIt was.\u201d he says before clenching his and activating the Reality Stone to make the surroundings disappear and appear as if Titan is still inhabited. \u201cAnd it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.\u201d says Thanos. \u201cGenocide.\u201d Stephen says. \u201cBut random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted, came to pass.\u201d says Thanos making the illusion disappear. \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re a prophet.\u201d says Stephen sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m a survivor.\u201d says Thanos making you want to make a snide remark. \u201cWho wants to murder <i>trillions</i>.\u201d says Stephen. \u201cWith all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.\u201d Thanos says snapping his fingers to demonstrate what he plans to do. \u201cThey would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.\u201d he says.</p><p>Stephen stands up from the boulder and starts walking toward him. You get ready to engage if you need to. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019d finally rest\u2026 and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.\u201d Thanos says. \u201cThe hardest choices require the strongest wills.\u201d he says as he looks down at the ground as if thinking about something. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find our will equal to yours.\u201d Stephen says forming his shields as he speaks. Thanos looks up at him. \u201c<i>\u2019Our\u2019</i>?\u201d he asks. That\u2019s when he looks up to see Stark flying down with a giant piece of rock. He raises the gauntlet up ready to destroy it with the Power stone, but he can\u2019t because it crashes into him. \u201cPiece of cake, Quill.\u201d you hear Stark say as he flies past Quill. \u201cYeah, if your goal was to piss him off.\u201d says Quill before pressing the button behind is ear making his helmet appear and the rockets on his boots to activate. A purple cloud of energy comes from where Thanos was crushed with the rock. You hear him yell in anger before the pieces of the rock turns into bats that start flying toward Stark making him fly away, trying to get away. \u201cPeter go!\u201d you yell. You see him shoot a web at Thanos, hitting him in the eye making him not see Drax as he attacks his legs with his daggers. You create a portal to teleport over to where Thanos is and just as you exit the portal Stephen exits his own portal. You both begin conjuring weapons and then begin attacking Thanos. You see Quill fly toward you and the others just as Thanos knocks you and Drax away from him. You roll onto your side with a grunt. </p><p>You look up just as Stephen swings his sword at Thanos but Thanos catches the blade in his hand in mid-swing. He holds it still with his free hand before yanking the web Peter shot at him earlier off of his face with his other hand. He glares at Stephen before making the blade disappear and then kicking Stephen away from him. Stephen easily catches himself with the help of his cloak. Quill shoots his blasters at Thanos as he makes his way over to him making the Titan fire at him with the Power Stone. Stephen makes platforms for him to step on as he gets closer. Quill flips over Thanos placing what looks like a bomb on his back. Thanos turns to Quill just as he flips him off. You open a portal for him to jump through. \u201cBoom!\u201d he says as he jumps through the portal.</p><p>The bomb goes off making Thanos go down to his knees. \u201cDon\u2019t let him close his fist.\u201d you hear Stephen say to the cloak. The cloak flies over to Thanos, wrapping around the gauntlet so that he can\u2019t make a fist. Stephen creates a portal and Peter jumps out of it. \u201cMagic.\u201d he says as he hits Thanos before going through another portal. \u201cMore magic.\u201d he says as he comes out of another portal. \u201cMagic with a kick.\u201d he says kicking Thanos in the face. He comes through the fourth portal. \u201cMagic with a\u2026\u201d he says but Thanos wraps his hand around his throat throwing him down onto the ground. \u201c<i>Insect!</i>\u201d Thanos growls at him before throwing him away from him and into Stephen making them both hit the ground. You rush over to them. \u201cYou 2 alright?\u201d you ask as you kneel down next to Peter who had the hardest impact out of the 2 of them. </p><p>Before either of them can reply you hear an explosion behind you. You turn to see Stark firing multiple bombs at Thanos. Thanos then uses the Space stone to absorb the fire before shooting it back at Stark making Stark crash into what looks like a spaceship. You then see Peter swing behind Thanos and shoot a web at his hand pulling on it to keep Thanos in one place and not use the gauntlet. Thanos pulls against the web hitting Peter in the face before pulling the web off the gauntlet. He start to turn around when a ship crashes into him. When Thanos stops moving you see him get covered by 2 pieces of metal. He gets up to his feet, pushing the metal off him. You see a figure climb out of the ship before jumping up and attacking Thanos. <i>'This must be Nebula, Gamora\u2019s sister.\u2019</i> You think as Nebula pulls out a sword getting ready to attack again. Thanos smirks as he looks up at her. \u201cWell, well, well.\u201d he says. \u201cYou should\u2019ve killed me.\u201d Nebula growls at him. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been a waste of parts!\u201d Thanos exclaims. Nebula grits her teeth before attacking him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gamora?\u201d she asks him angrily. Thanos doesn\u2019t answer, he just hits her with his arm making her go backwards and onto a pile of metal.</p><p>You and Stephen stand on a structure looking down at Thanos. You both conjure whips of melted metal and throw them at Thanos and making them wrap the gauntlet. Thanos struggles against the hot metal. Drax slides in behind him, kicking his leg. Quill fires a magnet to immobilize his other arm. And Peter attaches a web to his chest. You and Stephen remove the metal from the gauntlet when Stark flies over to him, grabbing the gauntlet to try and get it off. Thanos struggles against Peter and the others. Peter activates his spider legs to make him stay in one place. Once Thanos is steady you conjure a portal for Mantis to jump through. She jumps through the portal landing on Thanos\u2019 shoulders. She places her hands on the sides of his head trying to put him under her control. Thanos yells in anger just before he goes still, signaling that he\u2019s under Mantis\u2019s control. \u201cIs he under? Don\u2019t let up.\u201d says Stark as he tries to get the Gauntlet off of his hand. \u201cBe quick. He is very strong.\u201d says Mantis. \u201cParker, help!\u201d Stark calls making Peter run over to him. You then wrap metal around his chest to keep him in place. \u201cGet over here. She can\u2019t hold him much longer. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Stark says to Peter as they both begin to pull on the gauntlet.</p><p>Quill lands behind you and then turns to Thanos with a smug smile. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be hard to catch. For the record, this was my plan.\u201d he says pointing a finger at Stark. He walks closer to Thanos. \u201cYou\u2019re not so strong now, huh?\u201d he asks Thanos. \u201cWhere is Gamora?\u201d he asks softly but with some sternness in his voice. \u201cMy Gamora.\u201d Thanos says. \u201cNo, bullshit!\u201d Quill exclaims. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asks angrily. \u201cHe is in anguish.\u201d says Mantis making Quill look up at her. He looks back at Thanos. \u201cGood.\u201d he says smugly. \u201cHe\u2026 He mourns.\u201d says Mantis. \u201cWhat does this monster have to mourn?\u201d Drax asks as he keeps a hold on Thanos\u2019 leg. \u201cGamora.\u201d you hear Nebula say softly. Quill turns to her. <i>'Oh no.\u2019</i> you think. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks her softly. \u201cHe took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone. But she didn\u2019t.\u201d Nebula says. \u201cOkay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?\u201d Stark asks Quill as he still tries to get the Gauntlet off Thanos\u2019 hand.</p><p>Quill slowly turns to Thanos, anger and sadness in his eyes. \u201cQuill, don\u2019t.\u201d you say sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t engage. We almost got this off!\u201d says Stark but Quill ignores both of your warnings by asking. \u201cTell me she\u2019s lying.\u201d he says sternly. Thanos doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cAsshole, tell me you didn\u2019t do it!\u201d Quill yells. \u201cQuill.\u201d you say sternly. \u201cI had to.\u201d Thanos groans out. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. No, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Quill says at the brink of tears. \u201cQuill.\u201d you say trying to make him look at you. He ignores you and his face contorts into anger and he starts hitting Thanos in the face with his blaster. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t!\u201d he exclaims as he continues to hit him and making Mantis let go of his head. Stark rushes over to him. \u201cQuill!\u201d he says grabbing his arm to make him stop. \u201cHey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cIt\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming. I got it, I got it!\u201d says Peter as he continues to pull on the gauntlet. He almost gets it off when Thanos headbutts Mantis and yanks the gauntlet away from Peter. He grabs Mantis and throws her off of him. \u201cOh, God.\u201d says Peter as he gets up and jumps to catch her. You see him land with the spider legs protecting the 2 of them. Thanos then kicks Drax off of his leg making him knock into Quill, Nebula and Stark, leaving you and Stephen still holding onto him with your ropes of melted metal. He then yanks you 2 into the air away from him. </p><p>You both land in the rubble hard. You groan in pain as you try to get up. You turn your head to see Stephen laying next to you. You crawl over to him. \u201cStephen.\u201d you say softly. \u201cStephen, wake up.\u201d you say shaking his shoulder. He groans in response letting you know that he\u2019s okay. You look back at the battle to see Thanos using the space stone to make the planet he\u2019s pointing at come down in several large meteors toward Stark. You see Stark try to fly away only to be blocked by a large meteorite and crashing into the ground. You create a shield around you and Stephen to protect the 2 of you from the meteors. As you hold the shield up Stephen sits up and looks around. \u201cWell, that didn\u2019t work.\u201d he says before looking at you. \u201cYeah, no kidding.\u201d you say before a pretty large meteor hits your shield making you grunt as you hold the shield up.</p><p>Once the meteors stop landing near the 2 of you, you both get up and run to where Thanos is. You both stand on the rock staring at him for a moment before conjuring shields and slamming them to the ground making a lightning bolt that bounces against rocks that are floating to where Thanos stands. Thanos jumps off the rock just before the lightning strike hits him. As he\u2019s in the air he uses the Power Stone and shoots it at the 2 of you. Stephen makes a shield of glass stopping the blast from hitting the 2 of you. He pushes the glass toward Thanos. Thanos puts his fist to the glass shattering it before using the Space Stone to suck the glass in and shoot at you and Stephen in a funnel shape ball of energy. You conjure a ball of magic in your hands before making a shield to protect the 2 of you, making the funnel turn into butterflies. \u201cGo and help the others.\u201d Stephen says as Thanos looks at the butterflies in confusion. You nod and run to where the others are.</p><p>As you help the others out of the webs Peter put them in you turn and see multiple duplicates of Stephen surrounding Thanos. The duplicates conjure up whips and wrap them around Thanos\u2019 body. You see Thanos close his fist and him using the Power Stone to reveal the real Stephen. He pulls Stephen closer to him by using the Space Stone and Reality Stone. You turn to Peter and the others who nod at you to go help him. You runs as fast as you can toward Thanos and Stephen. Thanos grabs Stephen\u2019s throat. \u201cYou\u2019re full of tricks, wizard.\u201d Thanos growls making Stephen struggle against his grip. He grabs the eye of Agamotto breaks the chain making Stephen yell. \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cYet you never once used your greatest weapon.\u201d Thanos crushes it in his hand only to find that the stone isn\u2019t in the eye. \u201c<i>A fake.</i>\u201d he growls at him before throwing Stephen away from him. You watch as Stephen lands on the ground hitting his head on the ground hard. \u201cNo!\u201d you scream. You turn to Thanos and charge out of anger. You swing your sword that you conjure up out of magic at him only for him to catch it in his hand. He grins at you as he begins to close his fist. You gulp in fear of what Stone he\u2019ll use to kill you, but he\u2019s not able to close his fist because a piece of metal stops him from doing so. You hear Stark land behind you and you breath out in relief. \u201cYou throw another moon at me, and I\u2019m gonna lose it.\u201d Stark says from behind you. \u201cStark.\u201d Thanos says as he throws you off to the side making you hit the ground. \u201cYou know me?\u201d Stark asks. \u201cI do. You\u2019re not the only one cursed with knowledge.\u201d says Thanos. \u201cMy only curse is you.\u201d says Stark before deploying multiple rockets from his back. \u201cCome on!\u201d exclaims Thanos. </p><p>As they fight you get up and rush over to Stephen. \u201cStephen.\u201d you say as you kneel down next to him. You shake his shoulder to wake him up. He doesn\u2019t move and you see blood trickling from head. \u201cStephen. Stephen, wake up.\u201d you plead as you continue to shake him. He doesn\u2019t move so you look up at the battle taking place in front of you to see Stark form a large blade out of his armor as he uses his other arm to block the gauntlet from hitting him. He makes a move to stab him in the stomach but Thanos grabs the blade in his hand before breaking it and stabbing Stark in the stomach. \u201cNo!\u201d you scream as you see Stark gasping for air as the blade goes through his body. Thanos back him up to where he sits down on a piece of rubble and puts his hand on his head to make Stark look at him. \u201cYou have my respect, Stark. When I\u2019m done, half of humanity will still be alive.\u201d Thanos says to him before pushing him away and standing up straight. \u201cI hope they remember you.\u201d he says as he points the gauntlet at him, ready to use all four of the stones to kill him. You get ready to get up and save Stark but the voice of your husband, as well as a hand grabbing your wrist stops you. \u201cStop.\u201d You turn to see Stephen sitting up now. \u201cSpare his life\u2026\u201d he says making Stark look at him. \u201cAnd I will give you the stone.\u201d he says making you look at him in surprise. \u201cNo tricks.\u201d Thanos says. Stephen shakes his head making Thanos turn the gauntlet on him. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Stark says but Stephen begins to raise his hand. \u201cStephen\u2026\u201d you say softly. He turns to you. \u201cTrust me\u2026\u201d he says softly.</p><p>As you look into his green eyes, you have to trust him on this. He summons the stone holding it in between his index finger and thumb. Thanos raises his free hand and Stephen makes the stone float over to him, landing in his hand. You all watch as Thanos puts the stone into the gauntlet. He looks down at the circle on the back of his hand where the mind stone is supposed to go and smiles. \u201cOne to go.\u201d he says before 2 lasers hit the gauntlet making him look up to where Quill is flying toward him. You watch as Thanos summons a portal as Quill continues to shoot him, disappearing and going who knows where. Quill lands on the ground before pressing the button deactivating his helmet. He turns around and points his blaster in front of him. \u201cWhere is he?!\u201d he yells as he looks around as if Thanos will appear again. You see Stark spray a substance into his wound to keep him alive. Quill\u2019s eyes widen in surprise. \u201cDid we just lose?\u201d he asks. Stark turns to Stephen. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d he asks softly. Stephen gulps before replying. \u201cWe\u2019re in the endgame now.\u201d</p><hr><p>You sit next to Stephen, placing your head on his shoulder as Peter helps Tony to his feet and the others gather around the 2 of you. You then feel a change in the atmosphere, as if something bad is happening. \u201cSomething\u2019s happening.\u201d says Mantis proving your thought. A second later, she turns to ash making you and the others look at where she stood with wide eyes. You see Drax\u2019s hand start to turn into dust. He looks up at Quill. \u201cQuill?\u201d he asks before his entire body turns into ash. Quill turns toward Tony, who steps forward. \u201cSteady, Quill.\u201d he says. Your eyes widen as he too starts turning into ash. \u201cOh, man.\u201d he says softly before disappearing completely. \u201cTony\u2026 (Y/N)\u2026 There was no other way\u2026\u201d says Stephen as you and Stark turn to look at him. Stephen turns to you and smiles softly at you. \u201cI love you (Y/N).\u201d he says. You smile sadly back. \u201cI love you, too Stephen.\u201d He raises his left hand up to your cheek, caressing his cheek gently. You stare into his eyes before he quickly pulls you into a kiss, his hand still on your cheek.</p><p>You slowly pull away a couple moments later, your eyes widening immediately when you see Stephen turn to dust in front of you, some dust settling where your husband sat seconds ago\u2026 On the skin of your cheek you feel something. You brush your fingertips against your cheek and look down at your hand to see ash on your fingertips. You let out a small gasp as you glance at the ground to see something shiny. You pick up the small object and tears start to stream down your cheeks when you see what the small object is. Stephen\u2019s wedding ring. You put your free hand over your mouth as you sob uncontrollably.</p><p>When the tears slow down you turn just in time to see Peter disappear as well, leaving just you, Nebula and Tony. Tony\u2019s shoulders slump in sadness as he looks at his hand, looking at the ash Peter had left on it. \u201cHe did it.\u201d you hear Nebula say softly. You get up to your feet and walk over to Tony. He looks up at you with tears in his eyes. You give him your hand to help him up. He takes it and you pull him up. As he stands up he wraps his arms around you and cries into your shoulder. You hug him back, also crying over the loss of Stephen and the others.</p><hr><p>As you, Nebula and Tony plan on how to get back to Earth you glare at the ground. <i>'Thanos, you will pay for what you\u2019ve done to my husband, my friends and all the other people you\u2019ve killed.\u2019</i></p>",

I used an app that I have on my kindle to make it!!!</b>)</p><p>The spacecraft you, your husband Stephen, Tony Stark, and Peter Parker aka Spider-Man are in is going to Titan. Where Tony Stark has persuaded you and Stephen to bring the battle to Thanos before he gets to Earth to get the Mind Stone.</p><p>On the hologram in front of you, you see the surface of the barren planet, called Titan, that you assume was once Thanos\u2019 home or something along that line. \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d asks Peter from behind you, Stephen and Stark. \u201cI think we\u2019re here\u2026\u201d Stephen says. \u201cI don\u2019t think this rig has a self-park function.\u201d says Stark as he turns away from the screen to Peter. \u201cGet your hand inside this steering gimbal. Close those around it.\u201d he says to Peter closing the metal clasps around his hand as he does. Peter does the same. \u201cYou understand?\u201d Stark asks. \u201cYes.\u201d Peter answers. \u201cWe got to move it at the same time.\u201d Stark says. \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d says Peter waiting for the right moment to move his arm. The ship gets closer and closer to a giant star-shaped ship. You grab onto Stephen\u2019s arm in worry. He looks back at Stark and Peter. \u201cTurn! Turn! Turn!\u201d says Peter. You turn to see Stark\u2019s armor cover his face as they make the ship turn. They only turn it so much that the ship still hits the ship. \u201cOh boy\u2026\u201d you say as you and Stephen make shields to make the impact for the 4 of you less harmful. The ship breaks in half and the segment that the 4 of you are in lands on the ground.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Stephen turns to you as he gets to his feet. \u201c(Y/N). You alright?\u201d he asks as he helps you to your feet. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m alright.\u201d you say. He nods and walks over to Stark to help him up. \u201cYou alright?\u201d Stephen asks as he helps him up. \u201cThat was close.\u201d says Stark making Stephen nod. \u201cI owe you one.\u201d Stark says patting Stephen\u2019s arm. \u201cLet me just say,\u201d says a voice from behind you that makes you jump. You turn around to see Peter hanging upside down on a web. \u201cIf aliens, wind up planting eggs in my chest or something and I eat 1 of you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d he says. \u201cI do not want another single pop-culture reference out of you for the rest of the trip, you understand?\u201d Stark asks sternly. \u201cI\u2019m trying to say that something is coming.\u201d says Peter as he points behind him.</p><p>That\u2019s when a small metal ball rolls in between the 4 of you, making all 4 of you to look down at it. Then it explodes making the 4 of you go in different directions. You land next to Stephen with a grunt. You slowly sit up just in time to see 4 figures walk into the room. You see 1 of the figures turn to you and Stephen. \u201cThanos!\u201d he yells as he throws 2 knives at the 2 of you. You easily block them with a shield, protecting you and Stephen from the knives. The figure yells in anger and that\u2019s when the cloak of levitation wraps around his head making him fall back trying to get it off. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d Stephen says. \u201cYour welcome.\u201d you say with a wink before running over to help Stark. You run over to where the masked figure is and throw a ball of energy at him. He turns to you, aiming his blasters at you. \u201cWell, hello beautiful.\u201d he says lowering his blasters. You glare at him before throwing 2 balls of energy at him. They hit him making him fly backward. \u201cNever gonna happen, hotshot!\u201d you say before turning to Stark who\u2019s suit is magnetized to the metal of the ship. \u201cHold still.\u201d you tell him. He nods and doesn\u2019t move as you make a sword between the metal and his suit. You slide the sword in between the 2 and separate them. Stark stumbles before turning to you and nodding. \u201cThanks.\u201d \u201cNo problem.\u201d you say. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d you nod toward the battle taking place. He nods and picks you up by the waist, taking you to the man that\u2019s currently fighting the cloak. \u201cDie blanket of death!\u201d yells the man yanking the cloak off of his head. Stark lands in front of him and places a foot on his chest aiming his pulsar at him while you aim your sword at the masked figure who is now holding Peter captive with a blaster pointed at his head. \u201cEverybody stay where you are! Chill the F out!\u201d the masked figure says. He presses a button on the side of his mask making it disappear revealing his face. He turns to where you and Stark stand pointing his blaster at the 2 of you. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you this one time, where is Gamora?\u201d he asks. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do you 1 better,\u201d says Stark as his helmet disappears. \u201cWho\u2019s Gamora?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019ll do you 1 better,\u201d says the man that Stark\u2019s holding down. \u201cWhy is Gamora!\u201d he says.</p><p>The man holding Peter turns to Stephen. \u201cTell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I\u2019m gonna French fry this little freak.\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d yells Stark. \u201cYou shoot my guy, and I\u2019ll blast him! Let\u2019s go!\u201d he yells making the blaster on his hand bigger. \u201cDo it Quill! I can take it.\u201d says the man under Stark. \u201cNo! He can\u2019t take it!\u201d yells a squeaky voice making you turn and see what looks like a girl with antennae on her head all tangled up by Peter\u2019s webs. \u201cShe\u2019s right. He can\u2019t.\u201d says Stephen, making you nod in agreement. \u201cOh yeah, you don\u2019t want to tell me where she is? That\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll kill all 4 of you, and I\u2019ll beat it out of Thanos myself. Starting with you!\u201d he says pressing his blaster harder into Peter\u2019s head. \u201cWait, Thanos?\u201d Stephen asks confused. \u201cAlright, let me ask this 1 time. What master do you serve?\u201d Stephen asks. \u201c<i>\u2019What master do I serve\u2019</i>?\u201d asks the man holding Peter. \u201cWhat am I supposed to say? Jesus?\u201d he asks sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019re from Earth.\u201d says Stark pointing out the obvious. \u201cI\u2019m not from Earth. I\u2019m from Missouri.\u201d says the man glaring intensely at Stark. \u201cThat\u2019s on Earth, dipshit. What are you housing on us for?\u201d Stark asks. \u201cYou\u2019re not with Thanos?\u201d Peter asks. \u201c<i>\u2019With Thanos\u2019</i>?!\u201d the man holding him asks. \u201cNo. I\u2019m here to kill Thanos. He took my girl- Wait! Who are you?!\u201d he asks looking at the 4 of you. Peter\u2019s helmet goes down. \u201cWe\u2019re the Avengers, man.\u201d says Peter making the man take his arm away from his neck as he sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re the ones Thor told us about!\u201d says the girl making you and Stark turn to her. \u201cYou know Thor?!\u201d Stark asks in surprise. \u201cYeah.\u201d the guy next to Peter says while nodding. \u201cTall guy, not that good looking, needed saving.\u201d he says. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d you ask him.</p><hr><p>You\u2019re now by The Guardian\u2019s ship trying to think of a plan for when Thanos shows up. \u201cWhat the hell happened to this planet? It\u2019s 8 degrees off its axis, gravitational pull is all over the place.\u201d says Quill as he uses some kind of meter. \u201cYeah, we got 1 advantage. He\u2019s coming to us. We\u2019ll use it.\u201d says Stark before turning to you and the others. \u201cAlright, I have a plan.\u201d he says as he walks over to where you and the others stand. \u201cOr at least the beginnings of one. It\u2019s pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don\u2019t wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.\u201d Stark says before turning to Drax who\u2019s yawning. \u201cAre you yawning? In the middle of this, while I\u2019m breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?\u201d Stark asks him. \u201cI stopped listening after you said, <i>\u2018We need a plan.\u2019</i>\u201d says Drax. \u201cOkay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.\u201d says Stark as he turns to Peter Quill or as he likes to call himself - Star-Lord. \u201cSee, <i>'not winging it\u2019</i> isn\u2019t really what they do.\u201d says Quill. \u201cUh, what exactly is it that they do?\u201d Peter asks as he points toward Mantis and Drax. \u201cKick names, take ass.\u201d says Mantis. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d says Drax agreeing with Mantis as he turns to you, Peter and Stark. Tony is silent for a moment and you turn to him to see what he\u2019s going to say. \u201cAll right, just get over here, please.\u201d he says to them. He turns to Quill. \u201cMr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?\u201d he asks. Quill chuckles. \u201c<i>'Mr. Lord.\u2019</i> Star-Lord is fine.\u201d he says nodding at Mantis and Drax to come over. \u201cWe gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude\u2026\u201d Stark says but Quill interrupts him. \u201cDude, don\u2019t call us plucky. We don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d he says. \u201cAll right, we\u2019re optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan\u2026 and that way it might be really good.\u201d he continues making you roll your eyes and sigh in annoyance. \u201cTell him about the dance-off to save the universe.\u201d says Drax. \u201cWhat dance-off?\u201d you ask confused. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d says Quill shaking his head. \u201cLike in Footloose, the movie?\u201d Peter asks confused.</p><p>Quill perks up at that. \u201cExactly like Footloose.\u201d he says. \u201cIs it still the greatest movie in history?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt never was.\u201d says Peter shaking his head making Quill squint his eyes at him. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage this, all right?\u201d Stark asks turning to Peter. \u201cOkay.\u201d says Peter. \u201cWe\u2019re getting no help - from Flash Gordon here.\u201d says Stark. \u201c<i>\u2019Flash Gordon\u2019</i>?\u201d Quill asks as he walks toward Peter and Tony. \u201cBy the way, that\u2019s a compliment.\u201d he says making Stark and Peter turn to him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I\u2019m half human.\u201d says Quill. \u201cSo that 50% of me that\u2019s stupid\u2026\u201d he continues making Stark nod slightly as if queuing him to continue. \u201cThat\u2019s 100% you.\u201d Quill pointing his finger at Stark. \u201cYour math is blowing my mind.\u201d says Stark. \u201cAlright, guys, Enough. We don\u2019t need to-\u201d you say before Mantis interrupts you by saying. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d You all turn to her. \u201cBut does your friend often do that?\u201d she asks pointing toward Stephen who has been meditating on a rock away from you and the others. Your eyes widen when you see his head moving rapidly. \u201cStrange, you all right?\u201d Stark asks as you rush over to your husband. \u201cStephen! Stephen wake up.\u201d you say as you get to him. </p><p>He breaks out of his trance, falling to the ground, breathing heavily. You grab his arm to keep him from falling forward. \u201cHey. You\u2019re okay Stephen. You\u2019re back. You\u2019re alright.\u201d you say to him as you look into his green eyes. He instantly starts to calm down. \u201cHey, what was that?\u201d Peter asks from behind you. \u201cI went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.\u201d says Stephen. \u201cHow many did you see?\u201d you ask softly. \u201c14,000,605.\u201d he says. \u201cHow many did we win?\u201d asks Stark. Stephen looks up at the others and then looks back at you. \u201cOne.\u201d he says making your eyes widen. <i>'Oh, shit.\u2019</i> you think.</p><hr><p>You watch from your hiding place behind where Stephen currently sits on a boulder as a portal opens up and who you assume is Thanos walks out of it. You watch as he looks around the barren landscape around him seeing the crashed ship you and the others used to get here. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Stephen says making Thanos turn to see him. \u201cYou\u2019re much more of a Thanos.\u201d he says. Thanos looks at the ship again. \u201cI take it the Maw is dead.\u201d he says referring to the creepy squid guy that captured Stephen and caused you and the others to be here in the first place. You see Stephen nod at Thanos\u2019 statement. Thanos turns to Stephen again and begins walking toward him. \u201cThis day extracts a heavy toll.\u201d he says. He looks at the eye of Agamotto where he thinks the Time Stone is located. \u201cStill, he accomplished his mission.\u201d he says. \u201cYou may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.\u201d says Stephen. \u201cAnd where do you think he brought you?\u201d Thanos asks. \u201cLet me guess.\u201d says Stephen as he looks around. \u201cYour home?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Thanos stops, putting one his foot on a boulder as he looks at the ground. He looks up again. \u201cIt was.\u201d he says before clenching his and activating the Reality Stone to make the surroundings disappear and appear as if Titan is still inhabited. \u201cAnd it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.\u201d says Thanos. \u201cGenocide.\u201d Stephen says. \u201cBut random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted, came to pass.\u201d says Thanos making the illusion disappear. \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re a prophet.\u201d says Stephen sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m a survivor.\u201d says Thanos making you want to make a snide remark. \u201cWho wants to murder <i>trillions</i>.\u201d says Stephen. \u201cWith all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.\u201d Thanos says snapping his fingers to demonstrate what he plans to do. \u201cThey would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.\u201d he says.</p><p>Stephen stands up from the boulder and starts walking toward him. You get ready to engage if you need to. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019d finally rest\u2026 and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.\u201d Thanos says. \u201cThe hardest choices require the strongest wills.\u201d he says as he looks down at the ground as if thinking about something. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find our will equal to yours.\u201d Stephen says forming his shields as he speaks. Thanos looks up at him. \u201c<i>\u2019Our\u2019</i>?\u201d he asks. That\u2019s when he looks up to see Stark flying down with a giant piece of rock. He raises the gauntlet up ready to destroy it with the Power stone, but he can\u2019t because it crashes into him. \u201cPiece of cake, Quill.\u201d you hear Stark say as he flies past Quill. \u201cYeah, if your goal was to piss him off.\u201d says Quill before pressing the button behind is ear making his helmet appear and the rockets on his boots to activate. A purple cloud of energy comes from where Thanos was crushed with the rock. You hear him yell in anger before the pieces of the rock turns into bats that start flying toward Stark making him fly away, trying to get away. \u201cPeter go!\u201d you yell. You see him shoot a web at Thanos, hitting him in the eye making him not see Drax as he attacks his legs with his daggers. You create a portal to teleport over to where Thanos is and just as you exit the portal Stephen exits his own portal. You both begin conjuring weapons and then begin attacking Thanos. You see Quill fly toward you and the others just as Thanos knocks you and Drax away from him. You roll onto your side with a grunt. </p><p>You look up just as Stephen swings his sword at Thanos but Thanos catches the blade in his hand in mid-swing. He holds it still with his free hand before yanking the web Peter shot at him earlier off of his face with his other hand. He glares at Stephen before making the blade disappear and then kicking Stephen away from him. Stephen easily catches himself with the help of his cloak. Quill shoots his blasters at Thanos as he makes his way over to him making the Titan fire at him with the Power Stone. Stephen makes platforms for him to step on as he gets closer. Quill flips over Thanos placing what looks like a bomb on his back. Thanos turns to Quill just as he flips him off. You open a portal for him to jump through. \u201cBoom!\u201d he says as he jumps through the portal.</p><p>The bomb goes off making Thanos go down to his knees. \u201cDon\u2019t let him close his fist.\u201d you hear Stephen say to the cloak. The cloak flies over to Thanos, wrapping around the gauntlet so that he can\u2019t make a fist. Stephen creates a portal and Peter jumps out of it. \u201cMagic.\u201d he says as he hits Thanos before going through another portal. \u201cMore magic.\u201d he says as he comes out of another portal. \u201cMagic with a kick.\u201d he says kicking Thanos in the face. He comes through the fourth portal. \u201cMagic with a\u2026\u201d he says but Thanos wraps his hand around his throat throwing him down onto the ground. \u201c<i>Insect!</i>\u201d Thanos growls at him before throwing him away from him and into Stephen making them both hit the ground. You rush over to them. \u201cYou 2 alright?\u201d you ask as you kneel down next to Peter who had the hardest impact out of the 2 of them. </p><p>Before either of them can reply you hear an explosion behind you. You turn to see Stark firing multiple bombs at Thanos. Thanos then uses the Space stone to absorb the fire before shooting it back at Stark making Stark crash into what looks like a spaceship. You then see Peter swing behind Thanos and shoot a web at his hand pulling on it to keep Thanos in one place and not use the gauntlet. Thanos pulls against the web hitting Peter in the face before pulling the web off the gauntlet. He start to turn around when a ship crashes into him. When Thanos stops moving you see him get covered by 2 pieces of metal. He gets up to his feet, pushing the metal off him. You see a figure climb out of the ship before jumping up and attacking Thanos. <i>'This must be Nebula, Gamora\u2019s sister.\u2019</i> You think as Nebula pulls out a sword getting ready to attack again. Thanos smirks as he looks up at her. \u201cWell, well, well.\u201d he says. \u201cYou should\u2019ve killed me.\u201d Nebula growls at him. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been a waste of parts!\u201d Thanos exclaims. Nebula grits her teeth before attacking him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gamora?\u201d she asks him angrily. Thanos doesn\u2019t answer, he just hits her with his arm making her go backwards and onto a pile of metal.</p><p>You and Stephen stand on a structure looking down at Thanos. You both conjure whips of melted metal and throw them at Thanos and making them wrap the gauntlet. Thanos struggles against the hot metal. Drax slides in behind him, kicking his leg. Quill fires a magnet to immobilize his other arm. And Peter attaches a web to his chest. You and Stephen remove the metal from the gauntlet when Stark flies over to him, grabbing the gauntlet to try and get it off. Thanos struggles against Peter and the others. Peter activates his spider legs to make him stay in one place. Once Thanos is steady you conjure a portal for Mantis to jump through. She jumps through the portal landing on Thanos\u2019 shoulders. She places her hands on the sides of his head trying to put him under her control. Thanos yells in anger just before he goes still, signaling that he\u2019s under Mantis\u2019s control. \u201cIs he under? Don\u2019t let up.\u201d says Stark as he tries to get the Gauntlet off of his hand. \u201cBe quick. He is very strong.\u201d says Mantis. \u201cParker, help!\u201d Stark calls making Peter run over to him. You then wrap metal around his chest to keep him in place. \u201cGet over here. She can\u2019t hold him much longer. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Stark says to Peter as they both begin to pull on the gauntlet.</p><p>Quill lands behind you and then turns to Thanos with a smug smile. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be hard to catch. For the record, this was my plan.\u201d he says pointing a finger at Stark. He walks closer to Thanos. \u201cYou\u2019re not so strong now, huh?\u201d he asks Thanos. \u201cWhere is Gamora?\u201d he asks softly but with some sternness in his voice. \u201cMy Gamora.\u201d Thanos says. \u201cNo, bullshit!\u201d Quill exclaims. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asks angrily. \u201cHe is in anguish.\u201d says Mantis making Quill look up at her. He looks back at Thanos. \u201cGood.\u201d he says smugly. \u201cHe\u2026 He mourns.\u201d says Mantis. \u201cWhat does this monster have to mourn?\u201d Drax asks as he keeps a hold on Thanos\u2019 leg. \u201cGamora.\u201d you hear Nebula say softly. Quill turns to her. <i>'Oh no.\u2019</i> you think. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks her softly. \u201cHe took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone. But she didn\u2019t.\u201d Nebula says. \u201cOkay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?\u201d Stark asks Quill as he still tries to get the Gauntlet off Thanos\u2019 hand.</p><p>Quill slowly turns to Thanos, anger and sadness in his eyes. \u201cQuill, don\u2019t.\u201d you say sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t engage. We almost got this off!\u201d says Stark but Quill ignores both of your warnings by asking. \u201cTell me she\u2019s lying.\u201d he says sternly. Thanos doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cAsshole, tell me you didn\u2019t do it!\u201d Quill yells. \u201cQuill.\u201d you say sternly. \u201cI had to.\u201d Thanos groans out. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. No, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Quill says at the brink of tears. \u201cQuill.\u201d you say trying to make him look at you. He ignores you and his face contorts into anger and he starts hitting Thanos in the face with his blaster. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t!\u201d he exclaims as he continues to hit him and making Mantis let go of his head. Stark rushes over to him. \u201cQuill!\u201d he says grabbing his arm to make him stop. \u201cHey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cIt\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming. I got it, I got it!\u201d says Peter as he continues to pull on the gauntlet. He almost gets it off when Thanos headbutts Mantis and yanks the gauntlet away from Peter. He grabs Mantis and throws her off of him. \u201cOh, God.\u201d says Peter as he gets up and jumps to catch her. You see him land with the spider legs protecting the 2 of them. Thanos then kicks Drax off of his leg making him knock into Quill, Nebula and Stark, leaving you and Stephen still holding onto him with your ropes of melted metal. He then yanks you 2 into the air away from him. </p><p>You both land in the rubble hard. You groan in pain as you try to get up. You turn your head to see Stephen laying next to you. You crawl over to him. \u201cStephen.\u201d you say softly. \u201cStephen, wake up.\u201d you say shaking his shoulder. He groans in response letting you know that he\u2019s okay. You look back at the battle to see Thanos using the space stone to make the planet he\u2019s pointing at come down in several large meteors toward Stark. You see Stark try to fly away only to be blocked by a large meteorite and crashing into the ground. You create a shield around you and Stephen to protect the 2 of you from the meteors. As you hold the shield up Stephen sits up and looks around. \u201cWell, that didn\u2019t work.\u201d he says before looking at you. \u201cYeah, no kidding.\u201d you say before a pretty large meteor hits your shield making you grunt as you hold the shield up.</p><p>Once the meteors stop landing near the 2 of you, you both get up and run to where Thanos is. You both stand on the rock staring at him for a moment before conjuring shields and slamming them to the ground making a lightning bolt that bounces against rocks that are floating to where Thanos stands. Thanos jumps off the rock just before the lightning strike hits him. As he\u2019s in the air he uses the Power Stone and shoots it at the 2 of you. Stephen makes a shield of glass stopping the blast from hitting the 2 of you. He pushes the glass toward Thanos. Thanos puts his fist to the glass shattering it before using the Space Stone to suck the glass in and shoot at you and Stephen in a funnel shape ball of energy. You conjure a ball of magic in your hands before making a shield to protect the 2 of you, making the funnel turn into butterflies. \u201cGo and help the others.\u201d Stephen says as Thanos looks at the butterflies in confusion. You nod and run to where the others are.</p><p>As you help the others out of the webs Peter put them in you turn and see multiple duplicates of Stephen surrounding Thanos. The duplicates conjure up whips and wrap them around Thanos\u2019 body. You see Thanos close his fist and him using the Power Stone to reveal the real Stephen. He pulls Stephen closer to him by using the Space Stone and Reality Stone. You turn to Peter and the others who nod at you to go help him. You runs as fast as you can toward Thanos and Stephen. Thanos grabs Stephen\u2019s throat. \u201cYou\u2019re full of tricks, wizard.\u201d Thanos growls making Stephen struggle against his grip. He grabs the eye of Agamotto breaks the chain making Stephen yell. \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cYet you never once used your greatest weapon.\u201d Thanos crushes it in his hand only to find that the stone isn\u2019t in the eye. \u201c<i>A fake.</i>\u201d he growls at him before throwing Stephen away from him. You watch as Stephen lands on the ground hitting his head on the ground hard. \u201cNo!\u201d you scream. You turn to Thanos and charge out of anger. You swing your sword that you conjure up out of magic at him only for him to catch it in his hand. He grins at you as he begins to close his fist. You gulp in fear of what Stone he\u2019ll use to kill you, but he\u2019s not able to close his fist because a piece of metal stops him from doing so. You hear Stark land behind you and you breath out in relief. \u201cYou throw another moon at me, and I\u2019m gonna lose it.\u201d Stark says from behind you. \u201cStark.\u201d Thanos says as he throws you off to the side making you hit the ground. \u201cYou know me?\u201d Stark asks. \u201cI do. You\u2019re not the only one cursed with knowledge.\u201d says Thanos. \u201cMy only curse is you.\u201d says Stark before deploying multiple rockets from his back. \u201cCome on!\u201d exclaims Thanos. </p><p>As they fight you get up and rush over to Stephen. \u201cStephen.\u201d you say as you kneel down next to him. You shake his shoulder to wake him up. He doesn\u2019t move and you see blood trickling from head. \u201cStephen. Stephen, wake up.\u201d you plead as you continue to shake him. He doesn\u2019t move so you look up at the battle taking place in front of you to see Stark form a large blade out of his armor as he uses his other arm to block the gauntlet from hitting him. He makes a move to stab him in the stomach but Thanos grabs the blade in his hand before breaking it and stabbing Stark in the stomach. \u201cNo!\u201d you scream as you see Stark gasping for air as the blade goes through his body. Thanos back him up to where he sits down on a piece of rubble and puts his hand on his head to make Stark look at him. \u201cYou have my respect, Stark. When I\u2019m done, half of humanity will still be alive.\u201d Thanos says to him before pushing him away and standing up straight. \u201cI hope they remember you.\u201d he says as he points the gauntlet at him, ready to use all four of the stones to kill him. You get ready to get up and save Stark but the voice of your husband, as well as a hand grabbing your wrist stops you. \u201cStop.\u201d You turn to see Stephen sitting up now. \u201cSpare his life\u2026\u201d he says making Stark look at him. \u201cAnd I will give you the stone.\u201d he says making you look at him in surprise. \u201cNo tricks.\u201d Thanos says. Stephen shakes his head making Thanos turn the gauntlet on him. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Stark says but Stephen begins to raise his hand. \u201cStephen\u2026\u201d you say softly. He turns to you. \u201cTrust me\u2026\u201d he says softly.</p><p>As you look into his green eyes, you have to trust him on this. He summons the stone holding it in between his index finger and thumb. Thanos raises his free hand and Stephen makes the stone float over to him, landing in his hand. You all watch as Thanos puts the stone into the gauntlet. He looks down at the circle on the back of his hand where the mind stone is supposed to go and smiles. \u201cOne to go.\u201d he says before 2 lasers hit the gauntlet making him look up to where Quill is flying toward him. You watch as Thanos summons a portal as Quill continues to shoot him, disappearing and going who knows where. Quill lands on the ground before pressing the button deactivating his helmet. He turns around and points his blaster in front of him. \u201cWhere is he?!\u201d he yells as he looks around as if Thanos will appear again. You see Stark spray a substance into his wound to keep him alive. Quill\u2019s eyes widen in surprise. \u201cDid we just lose?\u201d he asks. Stark turns to Stephen. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d he asks softly. Stephen gulps before replying. \u201cWe\u2019re in the endgame now.\u201d</p><hr><p>You sit next to Stephen, placing your head on his shoulder as Peter helps Tony to his feet and the others gather around the 2 of you. You then feel a change in the atmosphere, as if something bad is happening. \u201cSomething\u2019s happening.\u201d says Mantis proving your thought. A second later, she turns to ash making you and the others look at where she stood with wide eyes. You see Drax\u2019s hand start to turn into dust. He looks up at Quill. \u201cQuill?\u201d he asks before his entire body turns into ash. Quill turns toward Tony, who steps forward. \u201cSteady, Quill.\u201d he says. Your eyes widen as he too starts turning into ash. \u201cOh, man.\u201d he says softly before disappearing completely. \u201cTony\u2026 (Y/N)\u2026 There was no other way\u2026\u201d says Stephen as you and Stark turn to look at him. Stephen turns to you and smiles softly at you. \u201cI love you (Y/N).\u201d he says. You smile sadly back. \u201cI love you, too Stephen.\u201d He raises his left hand up to your cheek, caressing his cheek gently. You stare into his eyes before he quickly pulls you into a kiss, his hand still on your cheek.</p><p>You slowly pull away a couple moments later, your eyes widening immediately when you see Stephen turn to dust in front of you, some dust settling where your husband sat seconds ago\u2026 On the skin of your cheek you feel something. You brush your fingertips against your cheek and look down at your hand to see ash on your fingertips. You let out a small gasp as you glance at the ground to see something shiny. You pick up the small object and tears start to stream down your cheeks when you see what the small object is. Stephen\u2019s wedding ring. You put your free hand over your mouth as you sob uncontrollably.</p><p>When the tears slow down you turn just in time to see Peter disappear as well, leaving just you, Nebula and Tony. Tony\u2019s shoulders slump in sadness as he looks at his hand, looking at the ash Peter had left on it. \u201cHe did it.\u201d you hear Nebula say softly. You get up to your feet and walk over to Tony. He looks up at you with tears in his eyes. You give him your hand to help him up. He takes it and you pull him up. As he stands up he wraps his arms around you and cries into your shoulder. You hug him back, also crying over the loss of Stephen and the others.</p><hr><p>As you, Nebula and Tony plan on how to get back to Earth you glare at the ground. <i>'Thanos, you will pay for what you\u2019ve done to my husband, my friends and all the other people you\u2019ve killed.\u2019</i></p>",

I used an app that I have on my kindle to make it!!!</b>)</p><p>The spacecraft you, your husband Stephen, Tony Stark, and Peter Parker aka Spider-Man are in is going to Titan. Where Tony Stark has persuaded you and Stephen to bring the battle to Thanos before he gets to Earth to get the Mind Stone.</p><p>On the hologram in front of you, you see the surface of the barren planet, called Titan, that you assume was once Thanos&rsquo; home or something along that line. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; asks Peter from behind you, Stephen and Stark. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re here&hellip;&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this rig has a self-park function.&rdquo; says Stark as he turns away from the screen to Peter. &ldquo;Get your hand inside this steering gimbal. Close those around it.&rdquo; he says to Peter closing the metal clasps around his hand as he does. Peter does the same. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; Stark asks. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Peter answers. &ldquo;We got to move it at the same time.&rdquo; Stark says. &ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo; says Peter waiting for the right moment to move his arm. The ship gets closer and closer to a giant star-shaped ship. You grab onto Stephen&rsquo;s arm in worry. He looks back at Stark and Peter. &ldquo;Turn! Turn! Turn!&rdquo; says Peter. You turn to see Stark&rsquo;s armor cover his face as they make the ship turn. They only turn it so much that the ship still hits the ship. &ldquo;Oh boy&hellip;&rdquo; you say as you and Stephen make shields to make the impact for the 4 of you less harmful. The ship breaks in half and the segment that the 4 of you are in lands on the ground.</p><p>Stephen turns to you as he gets to his feet. &ldquo;(Y/N). You alright?&rdquo; he asks as he helps you to your feet. &ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m alright.&rdquo; you say. He nods and walks over to Stark to help him up. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; Stephen asks as he helps him up. &ldquo;That was close.&rdquo; says Stark making Stephen nod. &ldquo;I owe you one.&rdquo; Stark says patting Stephen&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Let me just say,&rdquo; says a voice from behind you that makes you jump. You turn around to see Peter hanging upside down on a web. &ldquo;If aliens, wind up planting eggs in my chest or something and I eat 1 of you, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I do not want another single pop-culture reference out of you for the rest of the trip, you understand?&rdquo; Stark asks sternly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to say that something is coming.&rdquo; says Peter as he points behind him.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when a small metal ball rolls in between the 4 of you, making all 4 of you to look down at it. Then it explodes making the 4 of you go in different directions. You land next to Stephen with a grunt. You slowly sit up just in time to see 4 figures walk into the room. You see 1 of the figures turn to you and Stephen. &ldquo;Thanos!&rdquo; he yells as he throws 2 knives at the 2 of you. You easily block them with a shield, protecting you and Stephen from the knives. The figure yells in anger and that&rsquo;s when the cloak of levitation wraps around his head making him fall back trying to get it off. &ldquo;Thanks for that.&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;Your welcome.&rdquo; you say with a wink before running over to help Stark. You run over to where the masked figure is and throw a ball of energy at him. He turns to you, aiming his blasters at you. &ldquo;Well, hello beautiful.&rdquo; he says lowering his blasters. You glare at him before throwing 2 balls of energy at him. They hit him making him fly backward. &ldquo;Never gonna happen, hotshot!&rdquo; you say before turning to Stark who&rsquo;s suit is magnetized to the metal of the ship. &ldquo;Hold still.&rdquo; you tell him. He nods and doesn&rsquo;t move as you make a sword between the metal and his suit. You slide the sword in between the 2 and separate them. Stark stumbles before turning to you and nodding. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; you nod toward the battle taking place. He nods and picks you up by the waist, taking you to the man that&rsquo;s currently fighting the cloak. &ldquo;Die blanket of death!&rdquo; yells the man yanking the cloak off of his head. Stark lands in front of him and places a foot on his chest aiming his pulsar at him while you aim your sword at the masked figure who is now holding Peter captive with a blaster pointed at his head. &ldquo;Everybody stay where you are! Chill the F out!&rdquo; the masked figure says. He presses a button on the side of his mask making it disappear revealing his face. He turns to where you and Stark stand pointing his blaster at the 2 of you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask you this one time, where is Gamora?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll do you 1 better,&rdquo; says Stark as his helmet disappears. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Gamora?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do you 1 better,&rdquo; says the man that Stark&rsquo;s holding down. &ldquo;Why is Gamora!&rdquo; he says.</p><p>The man holding Peter turns to Stephen. &ldquo;Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I&rsquo;m gonna French fry this little freak.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; yells Stark. &ldquo;You shoot my guy, and I&rsquo;ll blast him! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; he yells making the blaster on his hand bigger. &ldquo;Do it Quill! I can take it.&rdquo; says the man under Stark. &ldquo;No! He can&rsquo;t take it!&rdquo; yells a squeaky voice making you turn and see what looks like a girl with antennae on her head all tangled up by Peter&rsquo;s webs. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right. He can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; says Stephen, making you nod in agreement. &ldquo;Oh yeah, you don&rsquo;t want to tell me where she is? That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll kill all 4 of you, and I&rsquo;ll beat it out of Thanos myself. Starting with you!&rdquo; he says pressing his blaster harder into Peter&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Wait, Thanos?&rdquo; Stephen asks confused. &ldquo;Alright, let me ask this 1 time. What master do you serve?&rdquo; Stephen asks. &ldquo;<i>&rsquo;What master do I serve&rsquo;</i>?&rdquo; asks the man holding Peter. &ldquo;What am I supposed to say? Jesus?&rdquo; he asks sarcastically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re from Earth.&rdquo; says Stark pointing out the obvious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not from Earth. I&rsquo;m from Missouri.&rdquo; says the man glaring intensely at Stark. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s on Earth, dipshit. What are you housing on us for?&rdquo; Stark asks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not with Thanos?&rdquo; Peter asks. &ldquo;<i>&rsquo;With Thanos&rsquo;</i>?!&rdquo; the man holding him asks. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m here to kill Thanos. He took my girl- Wait! Who are you?!&rdquo; he asks looking at the 4 of you. Peter&rsquo;s helmet goes down. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Avengers, man.&rdquo; says Peter making the man take his arm away from his neck as he sighs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the ones Thor told us about!&rdquo; says the girl making you and Stark turn to her. &ldquo;You know Thor?!&rdquo; Stark asks in surprise. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; the guy next to Peter says while nodding. &ldquo;Tall guy, not that good looking, needed saving.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; you ask him.</p><hr /><p>You&rsquo;re now by The Guardian&rsquo;s ship trying to think of a plan for when Thanos shows up. &ldquo;What the hell happened to this planet? It&rsquo;s 8 degrees off its axis, gravitational pull is all over the place.&rdquo; says Quill as he uses some kind of meter. &ldquo;Yeah, we got 1 advantage. He&rsquo;s coming to us. We&rsquo;ll use it.&rdquo; says Stark before turning to you and the others. &ldquo;Alright, I have a plan.&rdquo; he says as he walks over to where you and the others stand. &ldquo;Or at least the beginnings of one. It&rsquo;s pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don&rsquo;t wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.&rdquo; Stark says before turning to Drax who&rsquo;s yawning. &ldquo;Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I&rsquo;m breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?&rdquo; Stark asks him. &ldquo;I stopped listening after you said, <i>&lsquo;We need a plan.&rsquo;</i>&rdquo; says Drax. &ldquo;Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.&rdquo; says Stark as he turns to Peter Quill or as he likes to call himself - Star-Lord. &ldquo;See, <i>'not winging it&rsquo;</i> isn&rsquo;t really what they do.&rdquo; says Quill. &ldquo;Uh, what exactly is it that they do?&rdquo; Peter asks as he points toward Mantis and Drax. &ldquo;Kick names, take ass.&rdquo; says Mantis. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; says Drax agreeing with Mantis as he turns to you, Peter and Stark. Tony is silent for a moment and you turn to him to see what he&rsquo;s going to say. &ldquo;All right, just get over here, please.&rdquo; he says to them. He turns to Quill. &ldquo;Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?&rdquo; he asks. Quill chuckles. &ldquo;<i>'Mr. Lord.&rsquo;</i> Star-Lord is fine.&rdquo; he says nodding at Mantis and Drax to come over. &ldquo;We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude&hellip;&rdquo; Stark says but Quill interrupts him. &ldquo;Dude, don&rsquo;t call us plucky. We don&rsquo;t know what it means.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;re optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan&hellip; and that way it might be really good.&rdquo; he continues making you roll your eyes and sigh in annoyance. &ldquo;Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.&rdquo; says Drax. &ldquo;What dance-off?&rdquo; you ask confused. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; says Quill shaking his head. &ldquo;Like in Footloose, the movie?&rdquo; Peter asks confused.</p><p>Quill perks up at that. &ldquo;Exactly like Footloose.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Is it still the greatest movie in history?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;It never was.&rdquo; says Peter shaking his head making Quill squint his eyes at him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage this, all right?&rdquo; Stark asks turning to Peter. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting no help - from Flash Gordon here.&rdquo; says Stark. &ldquo;<i>&rsquo;Flash Gordon&rsquo;</i>?&rdquo; Quill asks as he walks toward Peter and Tony. &ldquo;By the way, that&rsquo;s a compliment.&rdquo; he says making Stark and Peter turn to him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, I&rsquo;m half human.&rdquo; says Quill. &ldquo;So that 50% of me that&rsquo;s stupid&hellip;&rdquo; he continues making Stark nod slightly as if queuing him to continue. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s 100% you.&rdquo; Quill pointing his finger at Stark. &ldquo;Your math is blowing my mind.&rdquo; says Stark. &ldquo;Alright, guys, Enough. We don&rsquo;t need to-&rdquo; you say before Mantis interrupts you by saying. &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo; You all turn to her. &ldquo;But does your friend often do that?&rdquo; she asks pointing toward Stephen who has been meditating on a rock away from you and the others. Your eyes widen when you see his head moving rapidly. &ldquo;Strange, you all right?&rdquo; Stark asks as you rush over to your husband. &ldquo;Stephen! Stephen wake up.&rdquo; you say as you get to him. </p><p>He breaks out of his trance, falling to the ground, breathing heavily. You grab his arm to keep him from falling forward. &ldquo;Hey. You&rsquo;re okay Stephen. You&rsquo;re back. You&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo; you say to him as you look into his green eyes. He instantly starts to calm down. &ldquo;Hey, what was that?&rdquo; Peter asks from behind you. &ldquo;I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.&rdquo; says Stephen. &ldquo;How many did you see?&rdquo; you ask softly. &ldquo;14,000,605.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;How many did we win?&rdquo; asks Stark. Stephen looks up at the others and then looks back at you. &ldquo;One.&rdquo; he says making your eyes widen. <i>'Oh, shit.&rsquo;</i> you think.</p><hr /><p>You watch from your hiding place behind where Stephen currently sits on a boulder as a portal opens up and who you assume is Thanos walks out of it. You watch as he looks around the barren landscape around him seeing the crashed ship you and the others used to get here. &ldquo;Oh, yeah.&rdquo; Stephen says making Thanos turn to see him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re much more of a Thanos.&rdquo; he says. Thanos looks at the ship again. &ldquo;I take it the Maw is dead.&rdquo; he says referring to the creepy squid guy that captured Stephen and caused you and the others to be here in the first place. You see Stephen nod at Thanos&rsquo; statement. Thanos turns to Stephen again and begins walking toward him. &ldquo;This day extracts a heavy toll.&rdquo; he says. He looks at the eye of Agamotto where he thinks the Time Stone is located. &ldquo;Still, he accomplished his mission.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.&rdquo; says Stephen. &ldquo;And where do you think he brought you?&rdquo; Thanos asks. &ldquo;Let me guess.&rdquo; says Stephen as he looks around. &ldquo;Your home?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>Thanos stops, putting one his foot on a boulder as he looks at the ground. He looks up again. &ldquo;It was.&rdquo; he says before clenching his and activating the Reality Stone to make the surroundings disappear and appear as if Titan is still inhabited. &ldquo;And it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.&rdquo; says Thanos. &ldquo;Genocide.&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted, came to pass.&rdquo; says Thanos making the illusion disappear. &ldquo;Congratulations, you&rsquo;re a prophet.&rdquo; says Stephen sarcastically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a survivor.&rdquo; says Thanos making you want to make a snide remark. &ldquo;Who wants to murder <i>trillions</i>.&rdquo; says Stephen. &ldquo;With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.&rdquo; Thanos says snapping his fingers to demonstrate what he plans to do. &ldquo;They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Stephen stands up from the boulder and starts walking toward him. You get ready to engage if you need to. &ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d finally rest&hellip; and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.&rdquo; Thanos says. &ldquo;The hardest choices require the strongest wills.&rdquo; he says as he looks down at the ground as if thinking about something. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find our will equal to yours.&rdquo; Stephen says forming his shields as he speaks. Thanos looks up at him. &ldquo;<i>&rsquo;Our&rsquo;</i>?&rdquo; he asks. That&rsquo;s when he looks up to see Stark flying down with a giant piece of rock. He raises the gauntlet up ready to destroy it with the Power stone, but he can&rsquo;t because it crashes into him. &ldquo;Piece of cake, Quill.&rdquo; you hear Stark say as he flies past Quill. &ldquo;Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.&rdquo; says Quill before pressing the button behind is ear making his helmet appear and the rockets on his boots to activate. A purple cloud of energy comes from where Thanos was crushed with the rock. You hear him yell in anger before the pieces of the rock turns into bats that start flying toward Stark making him fly away, trying to get away. &ldquo;Peter go!&rdquo; you yell. You see him shoot a web at Thanos, hitting him in the eye making him not see Drax as he attacks his legs with his daggers. You create a portal to teleport over to where Thanos is and just as you exit the portal Stephen exits his own portal. You both begin conjuring weapons and then begin attacking Thanos. You see Quill fly toward you and the others just as Thanos knocks you and Drax away from him. You roll onto your side with a grunt. </p><p>You look up just as Stephen swings his sword at Thanos but Thanos catches the blade in his hand in mid-swing. He holds it still with his free hand before yanking the web Peter shot at him earlier off of his face with his other hand. He glares at Stephen before making the blade disappear and then kicking Stephen away from him. Stephen easily catches himself with the help of his cloak. Quill shoots his blasters at Thanos as he makes his way over to him making the Titan fire at him with the Power Stone. Stephen makes platforms for him to step on as he gets closer. Quill flips over Thanos placing what looks like a bomb on his back. Thanos turns to Quill just as he flips him off. You open a portal for him to jump through. &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; he says as he jumps through the portal.</p><p>The bomb goes off making Thanos go down to his knees. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him close his fist.&rdquo; you hear Stephen say to the cloak. The cloak flies over to Thanos, wrapping around the gauntlet so that he can&rsquo;t make a fist. Stephen creates a portal and Peter jumps out of it. &ldquo;Magic.&rdquo; he says as he hits Thanos before going through another portal. &ldquo;More magic.&rdquo; he says as he comes out of another portal. &ldquo;Magic with a kick.&rdquo; he says kicking Thanos in the face. He comes through the fourth portal. &ldquo;Magic with a&hellip;&rdquo; he says but Thanos wraps his hand around his throat throwing him down onto the ground. &ldquo;<i>Insect!</i>&rdquo; Thanos growls at him before throwing him away from him and into Stephen making them both hit the ground. You rush over to them. &ldquo;You 2 alright?&rdquo; you ask as you kneel down next to Peter who had the hardest impact out of the 2 of them. </p><p>Before either of them can reply you hear an explosion behind you. You turn to see Stark firing multiple bombs at Thanos. Thanos then uses the Space stone to absorb the fire before shooting it back at Stark making Stark crash into what looks like a spaceship. You then see Peter swing behind Thanos and shoot a web at his hand pulling on it to keep Thanos in one place and not use the gauntlet. Thanos pulls against the web hitting Peter in the face before pulling the web off the gauntlet. He start to turn around when a ship crashes into him. When Thanos stops moving you see him get covered by 2 pieces of metal. He gets up to his feet, pushing the metal off him. You see a figure climb out of the ship before jumping up and attacking Thanos. <i>'This must be Nebula, Gamora&rsquo;s sister.&rsquo;</i> You think as Nebula pulls out a sword getting ready to attack again. Thanos smirks as he looks up at her. &ldquo;Well, well, well.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve killed me.&rdquo; Nebula growls at him. &ldquo;It would&rsquo;ve been a waste of parts!&rdquo; Thanos exclaims. Nebula grits her teeth before attacking him. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Gamora?&rdquo; she asks him angrily. Thanos doesn&rsquo;t answer, he just hits her with his arm making her go backwards and onto a pile of metal.</p><p>You and Stephen stand on a structure looking down at Thanos. You both conjure whips of melted metal and throw them at Thanos and making them wrap the gauntlet. Thanos struggles against the hot metal. Drax slides in behind him, kicking his leg. Quill fires a magnet to immobilize his other arm. And Peter attaches a web to his chest. You and Stephen remove the metal from the gauntlet when Stark flies over to him, grabbing the gauntlet to try and get it off. Thanos struggles against Peter and the others. Peter activates his spider legs to make him stay in one place. Once Thanos is steady you conjure a portal for Mantis to jump through. She jumps through the portal landing on Thanos&rsquo; shoulders. She places her hands on the sides of his head trying to put him under her control. Thanos yells in anger just before he goes still, signaling that he&rsquo;s under Mantis&rsquo;s control. &ldquo;Is he under? Don&rsquo;t let up.&rdquo; says Stark as he tries to get the Gauntlet off of his hand. &ldquo;Be quick. He is very strong.&rdquo; says Mantis. &ldquo;Parker, help!&rdquo; Stark calls making Peter run over to him. You then wrap metal around his chest to keep him in place. &ldquo;Get over here. She can&rsquo;t hold him much longer. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Stark says to Peter as they both begin to pull on the gauntlet.</p><p>Quill lands behind you and then turns to Thanos with a smug smile. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be hard to catch. For the record, this was my plan.&rdquo; he says pointing a finger at Stark. He walks closer to Thanos. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so strong now, huh?&rdquo; he asks Thanos. &ldquo;Where is Gamora?&rdquo; he asks softly but with some sternness in his voice. &ldquo;My Gamora.&rdquo; Thanos says. &ldquo;No, bullshit!&rdquo; Quill exclaims. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he asks angrily. &ldquo;He is in anguish.&rdquo; says Mantis making Quill look up at her. He looks back at Thanos. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; he says smugly. &ldquo;He&hellip; He mourns.&rdquo; says Mantis. &ldquo;What does this monster have to mourn?&rdquo; Drax asks as he keeps a hold on Thanos&rsquo; leg. &ldquo;Gamora.&rdquo; you hear Nebula say softly. Quill turns to her. <i>'Oh no.&rsquo;</i> you think. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asks her softly. &ldquo;He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone. But she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nebula says. &ldquo;Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?&rdquo; Stark asks Quill as he still tries to get the Gauntlet off Thanos&rsquo; hand.</p><p>Quill slowly turns to Thanos, anger and sadness in his eyes. &ldquo;Quill, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; you say sternly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t engage. We almost got this off!&rdquo; says Stark but Quill ignores both of your warnings by asking. &ldquo;Tell me she&rsquo;s lying.&rdquo; he says sternly. Thanos doesn&rsquo;t answer. &ldquo;Asshole, tell me you didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; Quill yells. &ldquo;Quill.&rdquo; you say sternly. &ldquo;I had to.&rdquo; Thanos groans out. &ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t. No, you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Quill says at the brink of tears. &ldquo;Quill.&rdquo; you say trying to make him look at you. He ignores you and his face contorts into anger and he starts hitting Thanos in the face with his blaster. &ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he exclaims as he continues to hit him and making Mantis let go of his head. Stark rushes over to him. &ldquo;Quill!&rdquo; he says grabbing his arm to make him stop. &ldquo;Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!&rdquo; he exclaims. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming, it&rsquo;s coming. I got it, I got it!&rdquo; says Peter as he continues to pull on the gauntlet. He almost gets it off when Thanos headbutts Mantis and yanks the gauntlet away from Peter. He grabs Mantis and throws her off of him. &ldquo;Oh, God.&rdquo; says Peter as he gets up and jumps to catch her. You see him land with the spider legs protecting the 2 of them. Thanos then kicks Drax off of his leg making him knock into Quill, Nebula and Stark, leaving you and Stephen still holding onto him with your ropes of melted metal. He then yanks you 2 into the air away from him. </p><p>You both land in the rubble hard. You groan in pain as you try to get up. You turn your head to see Stephen laying next to you. You crawl over to him. &ldquo;Stephen.&rdquo; you say softly. &ldquo;Stephen, wake up.&rdquo; you say shaking his shoulder. He groans in response letting you know that he&rsquo;s okay. You look back at the battle to see Thanos using the space stone to make the planet he&rsquo;s pointing at come down in several large meteors toward Stark. You see Stark try to fly away only to be blocked by a large meteorite and crashing into the ground. You create a shield around you and Stephen to protect the 2 of you from the meteors. As you hold the shield up Stephen sits up and looks around. &ldquo;Well, that didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; he says before looking at you. &ldquo;Yeah, no kidding.&rdquo; you say before a pretty large meteor hits your shield making you grunt as you hold the shield up.</p><p>Once the meteors stop landing near the 2 of you, you both get up and run to where Thanos is. You both stand on the rock staring at him for a moment before conjuring shields and slamming them to the ground making a lightning bolt that bounces against rocks that are floating to where Thanos stands. Thanos jumps off the rock just before the lightning strike hits him. As he&rsquo;s in the air he uses the Power Stone and shoots it at the 2 of you. Stephen makes a shield of glass stopping the blast from hitting the 2 of you. He pushes the glass toward Thanos. Thanos puts his fist to the glass shattering it before using the Space Stone to suck the glass in and shoot at you and Stephen in a funnel shape ball of energy. You conjure a ball of magic in your hands before making a shield to protect the 2 of you, making the funnel turn into butterflies. &ldquo;Go and help the others.&rdquo; Stephen says as Thanos looks at the butterflies in confusion. You nod and run to where the others are.</p><p>As you help the others out of the webs Peter put them in you turn and see multiple duplicates of Stephen surrounding Thanos. The duplicates conjure up whips and wrap them around Thanos&rsquo; body. You see Thanos close his fist and him using the Power Stone to reveal the real Stephen. He pulls Stephen closer to him by using the Space Stone and Reality Stone. You turn to Peter and the others who nod at you to go help him. You runs as fast as you can toward Thanos and Stephen. Thanos grabs Stephen&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re full of tricks, wizard.&rdquo; Thanos growls making Stephen struggle against his grip. He grabs the eye of Agamotto breaks the chain making Stephen yell. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.&rdquo; Thanos crushes it in his hand only to find that the stone isn&rsquo;t in the eye. &ldquo;<i>A fake.</i>&rdquo; he growls at him before throwing Stephen away from him. You watch as Stephen lands on the ground hitting his head on the ground hard. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; you scream. You turn to Thanos and charge out of anger. You swing your sword that you conjure up out of magic at him only for him to catch it in his hand. He grins at you as he begins to close his fist. You gulp in fear of what Stone he&rsquo;ll use to kill you, but he&rsquo;s not able to close his fist because a piece of metal stops him from doing so. You hear Stark land behind you and you breath out in relief. &ldquo;You throw another moon at me, and I&rsquo;m gonna lose it.&rdquo; Stark says from behind you. &ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Thanos says as he throws you off to the side making you hit the ground. &ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; Stark asks. &ldquo;I do. You&rsquo;re not the only one cursed with knowledge.&rdquo; says Thanos. &ldquo;My only curse is you.&rdquo; says Stark before deploying multiple rockets from his back. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; exclaims Thanos. </p><p>As they fight you get up and rush over to Stephen. &ldquo;Stephen.&rdquo; you say as you kneel down next to him. You shake his shoulder to wake him up. He doesn&rsquo;t move and you see blood trickling from head. &ldquo;Stephen. Stephen, wake up.&rdquo; you plead as you continue to shake him. He doesn&rsquo;t move so you look up at the battle taking place in front of you to see Stark form a large blade out of his armor as he uses his other arm to block the gauntlet from hitting him. He makes a move to stab him in the stomach but Thanos grabs the blade in his hand before breaking it and stabbing Stark in the stomach. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; you scream as you see Stark gasping for air as the blade goes through his body. Thanos back him up to where he sits down on a piece of rubble and puts his hand on his head to make Stark look at him. &ldquo;You have my respect, Stark. When I&rsquo;m done, half of humanity will still be alive.&rdquo; Thanos says to him before pushing him away and standing up straight. &ldquo;I hope they remember you.&rdquo; he says as he points the gauntlet at him, ready to use all four of the stones to kill him. You get ready to get up and save Stark but the voice of your husband, as well as a hand grabbing your wrist stops you. &ldquo;Stop.&rdquo; You turn to see Stephen sitting up now. &ldquo;Spare his life&hellip;&rdquo; he says making Stark look at him. &ldquo;And I will give you the stone.&rdquo; he says making you look at him in surprise. &ldquo;No tricks.&rdquo; Thanos says. Stephen shakes his head making Thanos turn the gauntlet on him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Stark says but Stephen begins to raise his hand. &ldquo;Stephen&hellip;&rdquo; you say softly. He turns to you. &ldquo;Trust me&hellip;&rdquo; he says softly.</p><p>As you look into his green eyes, you have to trust him on this. He summons the stone holding it in between his index finger and thumb. Thanos raises his free hand and Stephen makes the stone float over to him, landing in his hand. You all watch as Thanos puts the stone into the gauntlet. He looks down at the circle on the back of his hand where the mind stone is supposed to go and smiles. &ldquo;One to go.&rdquo; he says before 2 lasers hit the gauntlet making him look up to where Quill is flying toward him. You watch as Thanos summons a portal as Quill continues to shoot him, disappearing and going who knows where. Quill lands on the ground before pressing the button deactivating his helmet. He turns around and points his blaster in front of him. &ldquo;Where is he?!&rdquo; he yells as he looks around as if Thanos will appear again. You see Stark spray a substance into his wound to keep him alive. Quill&rsquo;s eyes widen in surprise. &ldquo;Did we just lose?&rdquo; he asks. Stark turns to Stephen. &ldquo;Why would you do that?&rdquo; he asks softly. Stephen gulps before replying. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the endgame now.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>You sit next to Stephen, placing your head on his shoulder as Peter helps Tony to his feet and the others gather around the 2 of you. You then feel a change in the atmosphere, as if something bad is happening. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo; says Mantis proving your thought. A second later, she turns to ash making you and the others look at where she stood with wide eyes. You see Drax&rsquo;s hand start to turn into dust. He looks up at Quill. &ldquo;Quill?&rdquo; he asks before his entire body turns into ash. Quill turns toward Tony, who steps forward. &ldquo;Steady, Quill.&rdquo; he says. Your eyes widen as he too starts turning into ash. &ldquo;Oh, man.&rdquo; he says softly before disappearing completely. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; (Y/N)&hellip; There was no other way&hellip;&rdquo; says Stephen as you and Stark turn to look at him. Stephen turns to you and smiles softly at you. &ldquo;I love you (Y/N).&rdquo; he says. You smile sadly back. &ldquo;I love you, too Stephen.&rdquo; He raises his left hand up to your cheek, caressing his cheek gently. You stare into his eyes before he quickly pulls you into a kiss, his hand still on your cheek.</p><p>You slowly pull away a couple moments later, your eyes widening immediately when you see Stephen turn to dust in front of you, some dust settling where your husband sat seconds ago&hellip; On the skin of your cheek you feel something. You brush your fingertips against your cheek and look down at your hand to see ash on your fingertips. You let out a small gasp as you glance at the ground to see something shiny. You pick up the small object and tears start to stream down your cheeks when you see what the small object is. Stephen&rsquo;s wedding ring. You put your free hand over your mouth as you sob uncontrollably.</p><p>When the tears slow down you turn just in time to see Peter disappear as well, leaving just you, Nebula and Tony. Tony&rsquo;s shoulders slump in sadness as he looks at his hand, looking at the ash Peter had left on it. &ldquo;He did it.&rdquo; you hear Nebula say softly. You get up to your feet and walk over to Tony. He looks up at you with tears in his eyes. You give him your hand to help him up. He takes it and you pull him up. As he stands up he wraps his arms around you and cries into your shoulder. You hug him back, also crying over the loss of Stephen and the others.</p><hr /><p>As you, Nebula and Tony plan on how to get back to Earth you glare at the ground. <i>'Thanos, you will pay for what you&rsquo;ve done to my husband, my friends and all the other people you&rsquo;ve killed.&rsquo;</i></p>",

I used an app that I have on my kindle to make it!!!</b>)</p>\n<p>The spacecraft you, your husband Stephen, Tony Stark, and Peter Parker aka Spider-Man are in is going to Titan. Where Tony Stark has persuaded you and Stephen to bring the battle to Thanos before he gets to Earth to get the Mind Stone.</p>\n<p>On the hologram in front of you, you see the surface of the barren planet, called Titan, that you assume was once Thanos&rsquo; home or something along that line. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; asks Peter from behind you, Stephen and Stark. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re here&hellip;&rdquo; Stephen says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this rig has a self-park function.&rdquo; says Stark as he turns away from the screen to Peter. &ldquo;Get your hand inside this steering gimbal. Close those around it.&rdquo; he says to Peter closing the metal clasps around his hand as he does. Peter does the same. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; Stark asks. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Peter answers. &ldquo;We got to move it at the same time.&rdquo; Stark says. &ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo; says Peter waiting for the right moment to move his arm. The ship gets closer and closer to a giant star-shaped ship. You grab onto Stephen&rsquo;s arm in worry. He looks back at Stark and Peter. &ldquo;Turn! Turn! Turn!&rdquo; says Peter. You turn to see Stark&rsquo;s armor cover his face as they make the ship turn. They only turn it so much that the ship still hits the ship. &ldquo;Oh boy&hellip;&rdquo; you say as you and Stephen make shields to make the impact for the 4 of you less harmful. The ship breaks in half and the segment that the 4 of you are in lands on the ground.</p>\n</p>",
