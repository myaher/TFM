He ventures a look up, going back to his phone when he fails to spot the shock of chestnut curls he\u2019s looking for. It\u2019s a few minutes later when he hears the chirp of a bright \u201chi!\u201d in front of him.</p><p>He looks up, smile inadvertently tugging at his lips when he sees the beanie, light pink pom-pom hanging off the back only adding to the cuteness of the boy\u2019s cold-flushed cheeks and red tipped nose, bundled adorably in an oversized parka that swallows him whole. \u201cPete! Finally, \u2018m freezing my ass off out here,\u201d he complains, depositing the cigarette in a nearby ashtray.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe if you didn\u2019t wear leather jackets in the winter while it\u2019s snowing, you wouldn\u2019t be cold!\u201d Peter exclaims, cheerful as ever, and Tony chuckles, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cSmartass. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go.\u201d Tony leads the way to his car, opening Peter\u2019s door for him, resisting the urge to tilt his head and go for the boy\u2019s lips when Peter places a kiss on his cheek in thanks. He shuts the door and jogs around to the other side, rubbing his hands together for warmth after he gets inside and turns on the heater.</p><p>Movement catches his attentions, and Tony turns to see Peter pull off his hat, running a hand through his hair, shaking the curls out and the snow off. Tony can\u2019t help himself, reaching out to tug lightly on the ear closest to him. \u201cAlways forget how pointy your ears are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeyyy,\u201d Peter whines, slapping Tony\u2019s hand away. \u201cI told you, all fairies have pointy ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, you\u2019re still on that? Fuck, you\u2019re lucky you\u2019re pretty, otherwise you\u2019d be at the bottom of the social ladder. I\u2019d be annihilated for just looking at you.\u201d Tony starts the car, turning over his shoulder to reverse out of the parking space. </p><p>Peter rolls his eyes, mouth pursing in distaste. \u201cYou humans. So petty.\u201d</p><p>Tony chooses not to comment on Peter\u2019s identical nature completely human. They spend the rest of the ride talking about anything and everything, jokes and banter coming quick and easy. Peter makes Tony laugh, Tony makes Peter giggle, and by the time they get home, he forgets all about Peter\u2019s \u2018eccentricities\u2019.</p><p>They make it home and up to Peter\u2019s room, skipping past the kitchen once they realize no one\u2019s home. They peel off their wet outer layers, Tony with just his leather jacket, Peter with his parka, a light jacket, a hoodie, and a sweater under that.</p><p>\u201cJesus, trynna get a heat stroke in negative ten degree weather?\u201d Tony questions from the corner, laughing.</p><p>Peter rounds on him with a pout, putting away his clothes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this, fairies get colder, quicker. It\u2019s warmer where we live.\u201d</p><p>Before Tony can respond, Peter pulls off his last sweater, light pink wings extending out behind his back. \u201cChrist, Pete, you still wear those? You should really give \u2018em back to whichever poor little girl you stole them from.\u201d</p><p>Peter takes the high road, sticking his tongue out before reaching for his laptop, the two of them beginning their work on their assignment. They research, write, and edit for hours, the sky gradually darkening as they work away. Its hours later when Tony looks up from his computer screen, cracking his neck and stretching his arms.</p><p>\u201cFuck, it\u2019s pretty dark outside, and the snow is still coming down pretty hard. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit, you\u2019re right.\u201d Peter helps Tony pack up, putting his stuff into his bag while the older boy pulls on his jacket. They walk to the front door together, Peter giving Tony a small peck on his cheek as he walks out of the door, a soft \u201cdrive safe\u201d whispered in his ear.</p><p>Tony smirks. \u201cAlways. \u2018Night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cText me when you get home!\u201d Peter calls, watching him get into the car and start it up. \u201cEven though I\u2019ll know,\u201d he mutters under his breath, shutting the door.</p><p>**</p><p>The first thing Tony sees when he manages to crack an eye open is pink. Endless amounts of pink that stretch as far as he can see, mixed in with what look like clouds of white. He sits up, doing a double take when his feet don\u2019t hit solid ground. He looks down, realizes he\u2019s <i>on </i>one of those floating cloud thingies. He looks closer to see what looks like blue grass and purple dirt and what the <i>fuck</i> is happening?!</p><p>\u201cTony! You\u2019re awake!\u201d Tony whips around to see Peter fluttering over to him, pink wings flapping behind him as he hovers a few meters off the ground. Tony blinks a few times, because he doesn\u2019t remember getting high at Peter\u2019s house, and he\u2019s never hallucinated at this level, regardless of whatever drug he\u2019s been on.</p><p>\u201cPete, what the fuck did we take?\u201d It comes out harsher than intended but Tony\u2019s mildly concerned, wants to know how fast this high is going to wear off.</p><p>Peter comes closer, cupping Tony\u2019s cheek and running a thumb across the older boy\u2019s cheekbone, eyebrows creased in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast thing I remember is being at your house, so I\u2019m assuming we took something, which is why I\u2019m high as fuck and hallucinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallucinating what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t see it too!\u201d Tony cries, panicking.</p><p>\u201cSee what, Tony?\u201d Peter looks more and more concerned with each passing minute, watching Tony morph from panicked to borderline hysterical.</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d Tony gestures wildly with his hand \u201cThe pink sky and the floating cloud and all the fucked up colours and how <i>fucking hot it is.</i>\u201d His eyes widen further when he hears Peter\u2019s airy giggle, confounded that he finds anything about the situation remotely amusing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hallucinating, silly. You got into an accident on the way home and your injuries were too severe, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to save you on Earth. So I brought you here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkayyyy,\u201d Tony intones, more than mildly concerned now that Peter had taken an even higher dose of whatever they\u2019d had than he had. \u201cAnd, for conversation\u2019s sake, where exactly is <i>here</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the fairies are from!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The bright and chipper and slightly manic smile on Peter\u2019s face is ringing all of Tony\u2019s warning bells and he just wants to get out of whatever fucking nightmare he\u2019s having. And then he\u2019s never hanging out with this kid again; honestly, the whole fairy thing should\u2019ve tipped him off. </p><p>\u201cThinking about how long it\u2019s going to take for your high to wear off? When you\u2019re going to wake up in the real world?\u201d Peter questions, breaking Tony\u2019s train of thought.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that. I believe this place is real\u201d \u2013 <i>sure he does</i> \u2013 \u201cJust wondering when you\u2019re gonna take me home,\u201d Tony finishes with a bright smile, hoping to sound convincing.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, that\u2019s easy enough to answer. Never!\u201d Peter exclaims, clapping his hands like he\u2019s just delivered the best news in the world.</p><p><i>Christ, this kid has fully lost it</i>. \u201cWhat do you mean, never?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe accident was so scary, I thought I was going to lose you for good,\u201d Peter says seriously, cupping Tony\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cSo we\u2019re staying here, where I can keep you safe forever and ever.\u201d</p><p><i>The more time that passes, the more Tony realizes this isn\u2019t a nightmare he\u2019s waking up from.</i></p>",

He ventures a look up, going back to his phone when he fails to spot the shock of chestnut curls he\u2019s looking for. It\u2019s a few minutes later when he hears the chirp of a bright \u201chi!\u201d in front of him.</p><p>He looks up, smile inadvertently tugging at his lips when he sees the beanie, light pink pom-pom hanging off the back only adding to the cuteness of the boy\u2019s cold-flushed cheeks and red tipped nose, bundled adorably in an oversized parka that swallows him whole. \u201cPete! Finally, \u2018m freezing my ass off out here,\u201d he complains, depositing the cigarette in a nearby ashtray.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe if you didn\u2019t wear leather jackets in the winter while it\u2019s snowing, you wouldn\u2019t be cold!\u201d Peter exclaims, cheerful as ever, and Tony chuckles, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cSmartass. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go.\u201d Tony leads the way to his car, opening Peter\u2019s door for him, resisting the urge to tilt his head and go for the boy\u2019s lips when Peter places a kiss on his cheek in thanks. He shuts the door and jogs around to the other side, rubbing his hands together for warmth after he gets inside and turns on the heater.</p><p>Movement catches his attentions, and Tony turns to see Peter pull off his hat, running a hand through his hair, shaking the curls out and the snow off. Tony can\u2019t help himself, reaching out to tug lightly on the ear closest to him. \u201cAlways forget how pointy your ears are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeyyy,\u201d Peter whines, slapping Tony\u2019s hand away. \u201cI told you, all fairies have pointy ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, you\u2019re still on that? Fuck, you\u2019re lucky you\u2019re pretty, otherwise you\u2019d be at the bottom of the social ladder. I\u2019d be annihilated for just looking at you.\u201d Tony starts the car, turning over his shoulder to reverse out of the parking space. </p><p>Peter rolls his eyes, mouth pursing in distaste. \u201cYou humans. So petty.\u201d</p><p>Tony chooses not to comment on Peter\u2019s identical nature completely human. They spend the rest of the ride talking about anything and everything, jokes and banter coming quick and easy. Peter makes Tony laugh, Tony makes Peter giggle, and by the time they get home, he forgets all about Peter\u2019s \u2018eccentricities\u2019.</p><p>They make it home and up to Peter\u2019s room, skipping past the kitchen once they realize no one\u2019s home. They peel off their wet outer layers, Tony with just his leather jacket, Peter with his parka, a light jacket, a hoodie, and a sweater under that.</p><p>\u201cJesus, trynna get a heat stroke in negative ten degree weather?\u201d Tony questions from the corner, laughing.</p><p>Peter rounds on him with a pout, putting away his clothes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this, fairies get colder, quicker. It\u2019s warmer where we live.\u201d</p><p>Before Tony can respond, Peter pulls off his last sweater, light pink wings extending out behind his back. \u201cChrist, Pete, you still wear those? You should really give \u2018em back to whichever poor little girl you stole them from.\u201d</p><p>Peter takes the high road, sticking his tongue out before reaching for his laptop, the two of them beginning their work on their assignment. They research, write, and edit for hours, the sky gradually darkening as they work away. Its hours later when Tony looks up from his computer screen, cracking his neck and stretching his arms.</p><p>\u201cFuck, it\u2019s pretty dark outside, and the snow is still coming down pretty hard. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit, you\u2019re right.\u201d Peter helps Tony pack up, putting his stuff into his bag while the older boy pulls on his jacket. They walk to the front door together, Peter giving Tony a small peck on his cheek as he walks out of the door, a soft \u201cdrive safe\u201d whispered in his ear.</p><p>Tony smirks. \u201cAlways. \u2018Night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cText me when you get home!\u201d Peter calls, watching him get into the car and start it up. \u201cEven though I\u2019ll know,\u201d he mutters under his breath, shutting the door.</p><p>**</p><p>The first thing Tony sees when he manages to crack an eye open is pink. Endless amounts of pink that stretch as far as he can see, mixed in with what look like clouds of white. He sits up, doing a double take when his feet don\u2019t hit solid ground. He looks down, realizes he\u2019s <i>on </i>one of those floating cloud thingies. He looks closer to see what looks like blue grass and purple dirt and what the <i>fuck</i> is happening?!</p><p>\u201cTony! You\u2019re awake!\u201d Tony whips around to see Peter fluttering over to him, pink wings flapping behind him as he hovers a few meters off the ground. Tony blinks a few times, because he doesn\u2019t remember getting high at Peter\u2019s house, and he\u2019s never hallucinated at this level, regardless of whatever drug he\u2019s been on.</p><p>\u201cPete, what the fuck did we take?\u201d It comes out harsher than intended but Tony\u2019s mildly concerned, wants to know how fast this high is going to wear off.</p><p>Peter comes closer, cupping Tony\u2019s cheek and running a thumb across the older boy\u2019s cheekbone, eyebrows creased in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast thing I remember is being at your house, so I\u2019m assuming we took something, which is why I\u2019m high as fuck and hallucinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallucinating what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t see it too!\u201d Tony cries, panicking.</p><p>\u201cSee what, Tony?\u201d Peter looks more and more concerned with each passing minute, watching Tony morph from panicked to borderline hysterical.</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d Tony gestures wildly with his hand \u201cThe pink sky and the floating cloud and all the fucked up colours and how <i>fucking hot it is.</i>\u201d His eyes widen further when he hears Peter\u2019s airy giggle, confounded that he finds anything about the situation remotely amusing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hallucinating, silly. You got into an accident on the way home and your injuries were too severe, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to save you on Earth. So I brought you here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkayyyy,\u201d Tony intones, more than mildly concerned now that Peter had taken an even higher dose of whatever they\u2019d had than he had. \u201cAnd, for conversation\u2019s sake, where exactly is <i>here</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the fairies are from!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The bright and chipper and slightly manic smile on Peter\u2019s face is ringing all of Tony\u2019s warning bells and he just wants to get out of whatever fucking nightmare he\u2019s having. And then he\u2019s never hanging out with this kid again; honestly, the whole fairy thing should\u2019ve tipped him off. </p><p>\u201cThinking about how long it\u2019s going to take for your high to wear off? When you\u2019re going to wake up in the real world?\u201d Peter questions, breaking Tony\u2019s train of thought.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that.

He folded his arms over his chest when Clint nodded. </p><p>\u201cYeah, pretty much,\u201d Clint admitted bluntly. </p><p>\u201cAnd no one of the others knows?\u201d Tony asked.

Well, and you know now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Tony asked and Clint shrugged. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Clint said and rose. \u201cI have to go back now, tormenting junior agents,\u201d he added and waggled his brows. </p><p>Tony followed him with his eyes but before he could enter the elevator, he turned back to him. \u201cOh, and just for the record,\u201d he said. \u201cI recommended you to become an Avenger.

He folded his arms over his chest when Clint nodded. </p><p>\u201cYeah, pretty much,\u201d Clint admitted bluntly. </p><p>\u201cAnd no one of the others knows?\u201d Tony asked. Clint shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cNat knows,\u201d he said. \u201cSteve knows and\u2026 I think Bruce knows, too. Well, and you know now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Tony asked and Clint shrugged. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Clint said and rose. \u201cI have to go back now, tormenting junior agents,\u201d he added and waggled his brows. </p><p>Tony followed him with his eyes but before he could enter the elevator, he turned back to him. \u201cOh, and just for the record,\u201d he said. \u201cI recommended you to become an Avenger.

Now he had them. </p><p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said and pointed at one of the pictures. &ldquo;The guy, who&rsquo;s talking with Coulson.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Agent Barton,&rdquo; Pepper said and Tony nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Agent Barton,&rdquo; he confirmed.

Not only did Ned keep calling Mr. Stark his father but he had made a playlist dedicated to father and son songs that he would play whenever Peter was around. He had gone so far as to hack Karen to play the playlist whenever Peter got near Mr. Stark.<br/>Now he was standing in the compound after more or less baring in bouncing and ranting about how he had won the science fair.

And War Machine was there too, and he laughed. He laughed. God, I&rsquo;m so screwed.&rdquo;</p><p>When Peter and Ned finally hung up it was near midnight and Peter made his way home. He curled up in his bed and grieved the unavoidable loss of another parental figure.</p><p>As Peter had expected he didn&rsquo;t hear from Mr. Stark all week. He guessed his days in the lab with him was over. Peter cursed himself for ruining everything. He was probably just some guilt case and now he had scared Mr. Stark away because he was incapable of controlling his emotions. He walked out of the school on Friday, wondering what excuse he would make up to May for not going to the compound over the weekend like usual, only to find Happy waiting for him in the parking lot. Peter had never been more relived and confused in his life. But he got in the car without saying anything and found a great happiness that Happy didn&rsquo;t treat him any different. At least he wouldn&rsquo;t lose him.</p><p>He got so caught up on talking to Happy he forgot to be nervous about meeting Mr. Stark again. When he got to the compound though, Mr. Stark didn&rsquo;t treat him any different. They sat there working on their separate stuff and just when Peter thought that maybe, maybe they could just brush Peter&rsquo;s mistake aside and never talk about him again Mr. Stark spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, about what you said on Monday &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to talk about it. We really, really don&rsquo;t have to talk about it. I&rsquo;m sorry, it won&rsquo;t happen again, I promise -.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;- you do know I love you right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;- again, I&rsquo;m sorry and you know what I&rsquo;ll just leave&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, did you hear what I said? I love you. I don&rsquo;t mind you calling me dad. I really don&rsquo;t. I mean the amount of times I&rsquo;ve called you my kid in front of Rhodey is quite frankly embarrassing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it is.&rdquo; Mr. Rhodes suddenly turned up. &ldquo;At this point I&rsquo;m surprised he hasn&rsquo;t applied for adoption.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rhodey!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know Peter, after you ran out of the building after calling Tony Dad, he cried. I have never seen him so happy. Well, until he started panicking about you not meaning it and it being a mistake. It took three hours to calm him down and then he called Pepper about it to panic some more.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stared at Mr. Rhodes completely floored. This had to be a joke. It was a joke.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on you two, hug already. You know you want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Stark spread his arms. &ldquo;Come here, son.&rdquo;</p><p>And Peter gratefully stepped in to his arms.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>\n\nSummary:</p>\n<p><i>Peter Parker had made the direst mistake of his life. He would never forgive himself for this. He had called Mr. Stark Dad. Peter blamed Ned. Not only did Ned keep calling Mr. Stark his father but he had made a playlist dedicated to father and son songs that he would play whenever Peter was around. He had gone so far as to hack Karen to play the playlist whenever Peter got near Mr. Stark.<br />Now he was standing in the compound after more or less baring in bouncing and ranting about how he had won the science fair. Too late he realised he had started that sentence with &ldquo;Dad&rdquo;. And in classic Peter Parker luck Tony wasn&rsquo;t even alone. Mr. Rhodes was there, currently looking as a kid who got the news that Christmas came early.
