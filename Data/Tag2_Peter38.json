That said, nothing creepy will come out of it. This age difference will become important later on in the story.

He had slipped it off of his wrist and he was about to fall backwards when he felt that it was finally off of his hand when Thanos grabbed hold of the gauntlet just in time, making Peter fall backwards, onto the ground. He was so close. He nearly had it. If it were not for Star-Lord\u2014no, Peter did not have time to think about that because Mantis had been thrown away like she was nothing and he is pretty sure she is not conscious. He leaps to his feet and goes after her, wrapping her in his arms and activating the Iron Spider\u2019s legs to help break their fall.</p><p>They land far away from the main fight and Peter can only watch the moment happen before him because the reality that maybe this is not the one outcome out of fourteen million that they win is hitting him so hard that he feels like he cannot breathe.</p><p>If he knew that this was going to be the end, he would have spent more time with Aunt May and Ned instead of going out at night, waiting for crime to happen. He would have visited you more at the X-Mansion, learned more about your time there, about your powers. Maybe he could have helped you out more, be it school or otherwise. He would have made more of an effort in school, maybe he would not have quit as many clubs as he did. Maybe he would have told MJ how he felt, maybe even hinted at it.</p><p>Peter thinks that he is too young to have so many regrets and he cannot bring himself to believe that this is the end of it all.</p><p>He is just about to gather his bearings, force himself to rejoin the fight, to help the adults out (oh my God, he really is just a kid compared to everyone here), when something crashes into the planet and sends everything and everyone flying. The gravitational pull of the planet seems to have been disturbed and Peter works fast to save his unconscious companions. He brings Mantis around with him, swinging around and avoiding debris, until he finds a place to web her to. He does the same for the others, quickly webbing them before the fly into orbit.</p><p>He regrets not knowing anyone\u2019s names.</p><!-- more --><p>\u2026</p><p>Visions falls in a heap next to you and, for a moment, he thinks that the two of you are done for. Both your wounds are fatal and the alien monster has the upper hand. He need only to attack him once more, hit him where it would really hurt. Vision thinks he has just enough power in him to hold him off, he just has to, but Vision is not confident that he will last long. He thinks of a game plan, a way to save not only himself but you, when Captain Rogers appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and tackles the alien down.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d Captain Rogers orders him before he turns back to his opponent. Vision does not need to be told twice but he finds that he does not have it in him to push himself off the ground. He is in too much pain, too damaged. You are still unconscious next to him, eyes closed and barely breathing. You probably\u2014desperately need medical attention.</p><p>Even if Vision could get himself to stand, he cannot bring you along with him if he manages to even walk.</p><p>\u201cGO!\u201d Captain Rogers urges when he sees that Vision is still in the same spot. Vision supposes that Captain Rogers has not caught sight of you or else he would have done something to help.</p><p>Vision forces himself to move once more, thinking of how to bring you along with him. It is his fault, really, that you are in the situation that you are in now. He thinks that, if you were awake, like all the other heroes, himself included, you would insist that it was your job.</p><p>If he makes it out of this fight alive, he makes a note to talk to Wanda about entrusting such a heavy responsibility to thirteen year olds.</p><p>Then again, if you were not around to help him, Vision does not think he would have made it this far.</p><p>Captain Rogers is able to disarm the alien, forcing the weapon to the ground. They fight hand to hand, moving further away from the weapon and Visions sees this as his chance. Instead of escaping, because honestly there is no way he can take you along with him, he makes a move towards the weapon, forcing himself to ignore the sharp shooting pain all over his body.</p><p>The alien pushes Captain Rogers to the ground and it looks like the hero is struggling to get himself free. Vision grabs hold of the weapon and in one swift movement, stabs the alien through his back. He pushes it further in, making sure that the blade is deep, and lifts him off of Captain Rogers before letting him fall to the side. The mere act takes all of Vision\u2019s energy and he falls to his knees.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to go,\u201d Captain Rogers says as he helps Vision to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t trade lives, Captain,\u201d Vision tells him and although he is directing the comment to the hero, he is also talking about you. He jerks his head towards your direction and Captain Rogers swears under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIs\u2026is she alive?\u201d He asks and Visions does not know how he would react if he heard otherwise.</p><p>\u201cJust barely,\u201d Visions replies. \u201cShe really held her own out here.\u201d</p><p>Captain Rogers shakes his head, not accepting the complement Vision pays you.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><p>And it is true. Vision cannot deny this especially when he sees you bleeding on the ground, very far away from home and everything that is familiar to you.</p><p>\u201cI do not think that matters during a war, Captain.\u201d</p><p>Captain Rogers\u2019 lips form a tight line and Vision thinks that maybe he should have kept his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cIt should.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>There really was no way for Peter to jump into the fight Dr. Strange and Mr. Stark had with Thanos, but, by the end of it all, he really wished that he had at least tried. He was so far away, watching over the unconscious Guardians, and he honestly did not have a lot of fight left in him, but goddammit he should have been there.</p><p>If he had, maybe Mr. Stark would not have been stabbed.</p><p>If he had, maybe Dr. Strange would not have felt like he had no option but to give the Time stone to Thanos.</p><p>All the ifs and maybe circled Peter\u2019s mind as he, Mantis, and Drax followed Star-Lord\u2019s lead and made their way to Mr. Stark and Dr. Strange. Thanos is nowhere to be seen and all they can do now is sit on this blasted planet and lick their wounds.</p><p>This is not how Peter imagined his first fight as an Avenger to play out.</p><p>He wants to go home, he really, truly wants to go home, but he cannot start whining like a child when everyone is helpless and defeated. He thinks how they can make it back to Earth but their original spaceship is bust and he is pretty sure that they cannot just build something out of all the metal bits and pieces scattered around. He wants to ask Mr. Stark what they should do next, what can they do next, but he keeps quiet. He has never seen Mr. Stark look so lost and afraid and, frankly, he needs to tear his eyes away because no one should see their hero look like that.</p><p>The entire time he had been in the ship and on this planet, Peter had forced himself not to dwell too much on thoughts of home, friends, and family. He needed to focus on the mission but now that they have failed, he could not help but let his thoughts go straight to those three things.</p><p>Peter cannot believe how much he misses Aunt May\u2019s (attempt at) cooking, Ned\u2019s constant movie references and eagerness to be the \u201cguy in the chair,\u201d and your complaints about your schoolmates and lessons. He does not want to think that there is no going back from this planet but after everything that is happened, Peter cannot find it in himself to be hopeful.</p><p>This is so bad. This is the worst thing that ever could have happened.</p><p>And it could have been prevented.</p><p>If only he had been stronger.</p><p>Peter has his head in his hands because he does not want his companions to see the look of utter defeat and despair on his face. Never mind the fact that they probably look the same way. He just needs to be alone with his thoughts right now. He tries to really focus on his memories, find comfort in dancing in the living room with Aunt May, beating Ned at a game of Mario Kart, and seeing juggle things in the air using your powers. He tries to remember the sounds of laughter, cheers of triumph, and whispers of promises.</p><p><i>Forever.</i></p><p>Peter cannot believe that he is breaking his promise to you.</p><p><i>Peter\u2026</i></p><p>Great, now you are haunting him.</p><p><i>Pe&hellip;Peter\u2026</i></p><p>He looks up from his hands and turns around to scan his surroundings.</p><p>Doctor Strange. Mr. Stark. Mantis. Drax. New Blue Robot Lady. Star-Lord.</p><p><i>I\u2026I\u2026Peter\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a memory,\u201d Peter mumbles to himself and maybe his companions heard him but he cannot bring himself to meet their gaze because he can hear your voice and you are nowhere on this planet.</p><p><i>Lo\u2026ou\u2026Peter\u2026</i></p><p>Peter feels his heart fall to his stomach and he settles back down on his seat. He feels sick and not in the way that he has felt the entire time in space.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, kid?\u201d Mr. Stark asks and Peter looks at the man and suddenly he cannot stay strong anymore.</p><p>\u201cI lost,\u201d Peter whispers and he cannot believe how hard it is to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mr. Stark says and it sounds like an apology. \u201cWe all did.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head but cannot bring himself to explain that yes, they lost the fight, but it feels like he has lost something more.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>You do not think you are dead because not only do you have a splitting headache (damn, what did you do before you passed out?), your mind is also filled with numerous thoughts that belong to you and those around. You feel nothing but pain and you think that maybe you should just stay wherever you are lest you injure yourself further. The voices in your head grow stronger, some of them shouts of victory and adrenaline while others are that off concern and exhaustion.</p><p>You feel a warmth on your belly and you feel Wanda\u2019s presence. You feel the pain in your side ebb away and you suddenly remember the tricks she has taught you during your time on the jet. You will your power to go to your wound and you help Wanda stitch you back together.</p><p>You are clumsy and you feel yourself let out gasps of pain but Wanda helps and before you know it, you feel yourself opening your eyes.</p><p>Everything is blurry and your throat feels dry. You are not sure if you are just thirsty or maybe you ate some dirt when you fell down. You do not want to think too much about it. You might just throw up.</p><p>The voices in your head seem far off now and you focus your attention to those closest to you.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d You hear Captain America ask and you do not need to read his mind to know that he is very tired.</p><p>\u201cShe will be,\u201d Wanda says and you feel like you could sleep for a hundred years. Maybe when you wake up, you could be the next Captain America.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid,\u201d Captain America says when you push yourself off the ground, keeping your cries muffled. \u201cYou can stand down now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll do that,\u201d you say with much effort and you try to relax against whatever it is that is behind you when you hear Vision let out a cry out pain. Wanda is immediately by his side and you feel a sense of dread wash over you, numbing you to your wounds.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Wanda asks and Vision lets out another sound of pain. \u201cWhat\u2026What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Vision replies, eyes wide and scanning the area.</p><p>You do not need to ask who it is. The wind patterns change and you look around the forest, trying to find out where Thanos is going to pop out from. Your eyes land on the space behind Dr. Banner and you watch as a blue portal appears behind him. Wanda is prepared to fight, red energy forming at her fingertips, and you force yourself to your feet, looking for things to use to attack.</p><p>Now is not the time to stand down.</p><p>Not while this monster is still around.</p><p>\u201cEyes up,\u201d Captain America says as he begins to make his way towards Thanos, \u201cStay sharp.\u201d</p><p>You watch from your place as Thanos easily defeats the Avengers, trapping Dr. Banner in stone, tossing Captain America aside, knocking out the Black Panther, and destroying the Falcon\u2019s wings. You immediately lose concentration and are scared. These are Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes and Thanos is going through them like they are nothing. You look to Wanda and Vision and see that although you are near them, you are not close enough to protect or be protected.</p><p>You see that the other Avengers are coming closer and you try to buy them some time by using all that is left in you to create a force field to keep Thanos from coming any closer.

He does the same for the others, quickly webbing them before the fly into orbit.</p><p>He regrets not knowing anyone\u2019s names.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2026</p><p>Visions falls in a heap next to you and, for a moment, he thinks that the two of you are done for. Both your wounds are fatal and the alien monster has the upper hand. He need only to attack him once more, hit him where it would really hurt. Vision thinks he has just enough power in him to hold him off, he just has to, but Vision is not confident that he will last long. He thinks of a game plan, a way to save not only himself but you, when Captain Rogers appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and tackles the alien down.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d Captain Rogers orders him before he turns back to his opponent. Vision does not need to be told twice but he finds that he does not have it in him to push himself off the ground. He is in too much pain, too damaged. You are still unconscious next to him, eyes closed and barely breathing. You probably\u2014desperately need medical attention.</p><p>Even if Vision could get himself to stand, he cannot bring you along with him if he manages to even walk.</p><p>\u201cGO!\u201d Captain Rogers urges when he sees that Vision is still in the same spot. Vision supposes that Captain Rogers has not caught sight of you or else he would have done something to help.</p><p>Vision forces himself to move once more, thinking of how to bring you along with him. It is his fault, really, that you are in the situation that you are in now. He thinks that, if you were awake, like all the other heroes, himself included, you would insist that it was your job.</p><p>If he makes it out of this fight alive, he makes a note to talk to Wanda about entrusting such a heavy responsibility to thirteen year olds.</p><p>Then again, if you were not around to help him, Vision does not think he would have made it this far.</p><p>Captain Rogers is able to disarm the alien, forcing the weapon to the ground. They fight hand to hand, moving further away from the weapon and Visions sees this as his chance. Instead of escaping, because honestly there is no way he can take you along with him, he makes a move towards the weapon, forcing himself to ignore the sharp shooting pain all over his body.</p><p>The alien pushes Captain Rogers to the ground and it looks like the hero is struggling to get himself free. Vision grabs hold of the weapon and in one swift movement, stabs the alien through his back. He pushes it further in, making sure that the blade is deep, and lifts him off of Captain Rogers before letting him fall to the side. The mere act takes all of Vision\u2019s energy and he falls to his knees.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to go,\u201d Captain Rogers says as he helps Vision to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t trade lives, Captain,\u201d Vision tells him and although he is directing the comment to the hero, he is also talking about you. He jerks his head towards your direction and Captain Rogers swears under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIs\u2026is she alive?\u201d He asks and Visions does not know how he would react if he heard otherwise.</p><p>\u201cJust barely,\u201d Visions replies. \u201cShe really held her own out here.\u201d</p><p>Captain Rogers shakes his head, not accepting the complement Vision pays you.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><p>And it is true. Vision cannot deny this especially when he sees you bleeding on the ground, very far away from home and everything that is familiar to you.</p><p>\u201cI do not think that matters during a war, Captain.\u201d</p><p>Captain Rogers\u2019 lips form a tight line and Vision thinks that maybe he should have kept his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cIt should.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>There really was no way for Peter to jump into the fight Dr. Strange and Mr. Stark had with Thanos, but, by the end of it all, he really wished that he had at least tried. He was so far away, watching over the unconscious Guardians, and he honestly did not have a lot of fight left in him, but goddammit he should have been there.</p><p>If he had, maybe Mr. Stark would not have been stabbed.</p><p>If he had, maybe Dr. Strange would not have felt like he had no option but to give the Time stone to Thanos.</p><p>All the ifs and maybe circled Peter\u2019s mind as he, Mantis, and Drax followed Star-Lord\u2019s lead and made their way to Mr. Stark and Dr. Strange. Thanos is nowhere to be seen and all they can do now is sit on this blasted planet and lick their wounds.</p><p>This is not how Peter imagined his first fight as an Avenger to play out.</p><p>He wants to go home, he really, truly wants to go home, but he cannot start whining like a child when everyone is helpless and defeated. He thinks how they can make it back to Earth but their original spaceship is bust and he is pretty sure that they cannot just build something out of all the metal bits and pieces scattered around. He wants to ask Mr. Stark what they should do next, what can they do next, but he keeps quiet. He has never seen Mr. Stark look so lost and afraid and, frankly, he needs to tear his eyes away because no one should see their hero look like that.</p><p>The entire time he had been in the ship and on this planet, Peter had forced himself not to dwell too much on thoughts of home, friends, and family. He needed to focus on the mission but now that they have failed, he could not help but let his thoughts go straight to those three things.</p><p>Peter cannot believe how much he misses Aunt May\u2019s (attempt at) cooking, Ned\u2019s constant movie references and eagerness to be the \u201cguy in the chair,\u201d and your complaints about your schoolmates and lessons. He does not want to think that there is no going back from this planet but after everything that is happened, Peter cannot find it in himself to be hopeful.</p><p>This is so bad. This is the worst thing that ever could have happened.</p><p>And it could have been prevented.</p><p>If only he had been stronger.</p><p>Peter has his head in his hands because he does not want his companions to see the look of utter defeat and despair on his face. Never mind the fact that they probably look the same way. He just needs to be alone with his thoughts right now. He tries to really focus on his memories, find comfort in dancing in the living room with Aunt May, beating Ned at a game of Mario Kart, and seeing juggle things in the air using your powers. He tries to remember the sounds of laughter, cheers of triumph, and whispers of promises.</p><p><i>Forever.</i></p><p>Peter cannot believe that he is breaking his promise to you.</p><p><i>Peter\u2026</i></p><p>Great, now you are haunting him.</p><p><i>Pe\u2026Peter\u2026</i></p><p>He looks up from his hands and turns around to scan his surroundings.</p><p>Doctor Strange. Mr. Stark. Mantis. Drax. New Blue Robot Lady. Star-Lord.</p><p><i>I\u2026I\u2026Peter\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a memory,\u201d Peter mumbles to himself and maybe his companions heard him but he cannot bring himself to meet their gaze because he can hear your voice and you are nowhere on this planet.</p><p><i>Lo\u2026ou\u2026Peter\u2026</i></p><p>Peter feels his heart fall to his stomach and he settles back down on his seat. He feels sick and not in the way that he has felt the entire time in space.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, kid?\u201d Mr. Stark asks and Peter looks at the man and suddenly he cannot stay strong anymore.</p><p>\u201cI lost,\u201d Peter whispers and he cannot believe how hard it is to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mr. Stark says and it sounds like an apology. \u201cWe all did.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head but cannot bring himself to explain that yes, they lost the fight, but it feels like he has lost something more.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>You do not think you are dead because not only do you have a splitting headache (damn, what did you do before you passed out?), your mind is also filled with numerous thoughts that belong to you and those around. You feel nothing but pain and you think that maybe you should just stay wherever you are lest you injure yourself further. The voices in your head grow stronger, some of them shouts of victory and adrenaline while others are that off concern and exhaustion.</p><p>You feel a warmth on your belly and you feel Wanda\u2019s presence. You feel the pain in your side ebb away and you suddenly remember the tricks she has taught you during your time on the jet. You will your power to go to your wound and you help Wanda stitch you back together.</p><p>You are clumsy and you feel yourself let out gasps of pain but Wanda helps and before you know it, you feel yourself opening your eyes.</p><p>Everything is blurry and your throat feels dry. You are not sure if you are just thirsty or maybe you ate some dirt when you fell down. You do not want to think too much about it. You might just throw up.</p><p>The voices in your head seem far off now and you focus your attention to those closest to you.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d You hear Captain America ask and you do not need to read his mind to know that he is very tired.</p><p>\u201cShe will be,\u201d Wanda says and you feel like you could sleep for a hundred years. Maybe when you wake up, you could be the next Captain America.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid,\u201d Captain America says when you push yourself off the ground, keeping your cries muffled. \u201cYou can stand down now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll do that,\u201d you say with much effort and you try to relax against whatever it is that is behind you when you hear Vision let out a cry out pain. Wanda is immediately by his side and you feel a sense of dread wash over you, numbing you to your wounds.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Wanda asks and Vision lets out another sound of pain. \u201cWhat\u2026What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Vision replies, eyes wide and scanning the area.</p><p>You do not need to ask who it is. The wind patterns change and you look around the forest, trying to find out where Thanos is going to pop out from. Your eyes land on the space behind Dr. Banner and you watch as a blue portal appears behind him. Wanda is prepared to fight, red energy forming at her fingertips, and you force yourself to your feet, looking for things to use to attack.</p><p>Now is not the time to stand down.</p><p>Not while this monster is still around.</p><p>\u201cEyes up,\u201d Captain America says as he begins to make his way towards Thanos, \u201cStay sharp.\u201d</p><p>You watch from your place as Thanos easily defeats the Avengers, trapping Dr. Banner in stone, tossing Captain America aside, knocking out the Black Panther, and destroying the Falcon\u2019s wings. You immediately lose concentration and are scared. These are Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes and Thanos is going through them like they are nothing. You look to Wanda and Vision and see that although you are near them, you are not close enough to protect or be protected.</p><p>You see that the other Avengers are coming closer and you try to buy them some time by using all that is left in you to create a force field to keep Thanos from coming any closer. He nearly stops in his tracks, sensing the invisible barrier, and you almost feel victories when looks eyes with you. You try to push him back, you really do, but it is a futile attempt. He moves his hand in a motion that causes you to fly the opposite direction and land painfully on the ground. You try to get up but you feel the roots of the trees wrap around your arms, legs, and neck, and you know that you are defeated.</p><p>All you can do is listen to the grunts of pain from the Avengers as well as the cries from Wanda and Vision.</p><p>You close your eyes, waiting for the end to come.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/185061194901/its-hard-when-youre-young-peter-parker-x-reader\"></a><a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/185061194901/its-hard-when-youre-young-peter-parker-x-reader\">Part 22: Powerless</a></p><hr><hr><p><i>Taglist:</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIj52RC0XuSI6RcDC3_avug\">@xazu-ravenx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CmXuriy8t5caMStNuDaoQ\">@call-me-latte</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1P3msgsxO-Noc_jKlZKaPg\">@a-sunflower-sun</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbWnoS8kcQ-mmjGIamDWURg\">@duliz2014</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw4VjWrJEWr6WwBBMVBykcw\">@arisu003</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jpsUIfZHmT4_9ISd-kVKQ\">@slideseok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTY7MShbhiNb3Hauh3PpZA\">@niiamh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVRFoZYlCu8XDZ0nMvI8adw\">@intoomuchfandoms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzisYX8eqaV2l0raAyirelA\">@naturallyspontaneous</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnEBBWEAS-ky9AAIvck1ezQ\">@jimenatateyama</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-MFXpt1YV2wmNXQw0C9gQ\">@le-yona</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGs7qK6Vo81-rq7k3q4tONA\">@clint-bartxn99</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\">@kewl-r</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnoSxDk7r4DKrNxtGOj5jlw\">@autobotgirl15-blog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8RopNrvvyXKaF265RSVNXw\">@peter-spider-parker-man</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfkPfAyQgusMXCuj6SCob5A\">@redgemsposts</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muvpc7UiYHeXGUf5LhZj3MA\">@shantayok</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3fiyOXF_Q2PcFTV-Xi-2cg\">@throughlytired</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNX5ZZN90g-LRU5oJlZg6AQ\">@sk-o-mp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCSNlsBXojzIby9-m21lQTw\">@amb-q</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnJc3qUZdf4ThjsWqbDC1MQ\">@justfuxxingkillmealready</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjGA2SF0yjFFzEHVftwHPjg\">@spidey-quackson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBCr_bgyyEWgP4rzIVbOkQ\">@sketchcole</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJSpsgywe-IH9XI2oxhBqsQ\">@patat-boi</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWe-Gim3fCT58hc3c2V62yA\">@waywaya</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV155O6iryeIB1bzRvtXHXw\">@akira-0229</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFeag8NmH4_6GfQ2hXDmArg\">@yunggenoalpha</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL5ioo93YPr5IXYLdpa_N9w\">@alina-margaret</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnGf32jLkXSykoj5olbM7hg\">@astromilku</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnqojvhOI5PW669I4MMuSKA\">@thewaywarddaughter1967</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msGaFxudFWLw_ENpXzP1AJQ\">@minetticatinwonderland</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://softcrybabyboy.tumblr.com/\" title=\"ants and my ex's PP are the same size\">softcrybabyboy</a>\u00a0 @<a href=\"https://jeonginorjeongjin.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I was a daydreamer, but now I'm just lost in you\">jeonginorjeongjin</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://bees-are-so-great.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Bees\ud83d\udc1d\">bees-are-so-great</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://holyhumorliteraturelight.tumblr.com/\" title=\"BUCKY IS NOT A VILLAIN\">holyhumorliteraturelight</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://quirkyepicgamer.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Dumb\">quirkyepicgamer</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://shortpeoplematter.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Shorty\">shortpeoplematter</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://ipomea-alba-moonvine.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Untitled\">ipomea-alba-moonvine</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://shirukitsune.tumblr.com/\">shirukitsune</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://lilah427.tumblr.com/\">lilah427</a></i></p><p><i>Want to join the <a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/184700973876/fan-fic-taglist\">taglist</a>?</i></p>",

He had slipped it off of his wrist and he was about to fall backwards when he felt that it was finally off of his hand when Thanos grabbed hold of the gauntlet just in time, making Peter fall backwards, onto the ground. He was so close. He nearly had it. If it were not for Star-Lord\u2014no, Peter did not have time to think about that because Mantis had been thrown away like she was nothing and he is pretty sure she is not conscious. He leaps to his feet and goes after her, wrapping her in his arms and activating the Iron Spider\u2019s legs to help break their fall.</p><p>They land far away from the main fight and Peter can only watch the moment happen before him because the reality that maybe this is not the one outcome out of fourteen million that they win is hitting him so hard that he feels like he cannot breathe.</p><p>If he knew that this was going to be the end, he would have spent more time with Aunt May and Ned instead of going out at night, waiting for crime to happen. He would have visited you more at the X-Mansion, learned more about your time there, about your powers. Maybe he could have helped you out more, be it school or otherwise. He would have made more of an effort in school, maybe he would not have quit as many clubs as he did. Maybe he would have told MJ how he felt, maybe even hinted at it.</p><p>Peter thinks that he is too young to have so many regrets and he cannot bring himself to believe that this is the end of it all.</p><p>He is just about to gather his bearings, force himself to rejoin the fight, to help the adults out (oh my God, he really is just a kid compared to everyone here), when something crashes into the planet and sends everything and everyone flying. The gravitational pull of the planet seems to have been disturbed and Peter works fast to save his unconscious companions. He brings Mantis around with him, swinging around and avoiding debris, until he finds a place to web her to. He does the same for the others, quickly webbing them before the fly into orbit.</p><p>He regrets not knowing anyone\u2019s names.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2026</p><p>Visions falls in a heap next to you and, for a moment, he thinks that the two of you are done for. Both your wounds are fatal and the alien monster has the upper hand. He need only to attack him once more, hit him where it would really hurt. Vision thinks he has just enough power in him to hold him off, he just has to, but Vision is not confident that he will last long. He thinks of a game plan, a way to save not only himself but you, when Captain Rogers appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and tackles the alien down.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d Captain Rogers orders him before he turns back to his opponent. Vision does not need to be told twice but he finds that he does not have it in him to push himself off the ground. He is in too much pain, too damaged. You are still unconscious next to him, eyes closed and barely breathing. You probably\u2014desperately need medical attention.</p><p>Even if Vision could get himself to stand, he cannot bring you along with him if he manages to even walk.</p><p>\u201cGO!\u201d Captain Rogers urges when he sees that Vision is still in the same spot. Vision supposes that Captain Rogers has not caught sight of you or else he would have done something to help.</p><p>Vision forces himself to move once more, thinking of how to bring you along with him. It is his fault, really, that you are in the situation that you are in now. He thinks that, if you were awake, like all the other heroes, himself included, you would insist that it was your job.</p><p>If he makes it out of this fight alive, he makes a note to talk to Wanda about entrusting such a heavy responsibility to thirteen year olds.</p><p>Then again, if you were not around to help him, Vision does not think he would have made it this far.</p><p>Captain Rogers is able to disarm the alien, forcing the weapon to the ground. They fight hand to hand, moving further away from the weapon and Visions sees this as his chance. Instead of escaping, because honestly there is no way he can take you along with him, he makes a move towards the weapon, forcing himself to ignore the sharp shooting pain all over his body.</p><p>The alien pushes Captain Rogers to the ground and it looks like the hero is struggling to get himself free. Vision grabs hold of the weapon and in one swift movement, stabs the alien through his back. He pushes it further in, making sure that the blade is deep, and lifts him off of Captain Rogers before letting him fall to the side. The mere act takes all of Vision\u2019s energy and he falls to his knees.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to go,\u201d Captain Rogers says as he helps Vision to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t trade lives, Captain,\u201d Vision tells him and although he is directing the comment to the hero, he is also talking about you. He jerks his head towards your direction and Captain Rogers swears under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIs\u2026is she alive?\u201d He asks and Visions does not know how he would react if he heard otherwise.</p><p>\u201cJust barely,\u201d Visions replies. \u201cShe really held her own out here.\u201d</p><p>Captain Rogers shakes his head, not accepting the complement Vision pays you.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><p>And it is true. Vision cannot deny this especially when he sees you bleeding on the ground, very far away from home and everything that is familiar to you.</p><p>\u201cI do not think that matters during a war, Captain.\u201d</p><p>Captain Rogers\u2019 lips form a tight line and Vision thinks that maybe he should have kept his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cIt should.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>There really was no way for Peter to jump into the fight Dr. Strange and Mr. Stark had with Thanos, but, by the end of it all, he really wished that he had at least tried. He was so far away, watching over the unconscious Guardians, and he honestly did not have a lot of fight left in him, but goddammit he should have been there.</p><p>If he had, maybe Mr. Stark would not have been stabbed.</p><p>If he had, maybe Dr. Strange would not have felt like he had no option but to give the Time stone to Thanos.</p><p>All the ifs and maybe circled Peter\u2019s mind as he, Mantis, and Drax followed Star-Lord\u2019s lead and made their way to Mr. Stark and Dr. Strange. Thanos is nowhere to be seen and all they can do now is sit on this blasted planet and lick their wounds.</p><p>This is not how Peter imagined his first fight as an Avenger to play out.</p><p>He wants to go home, he really, truly wants to go home, but he cannot start whining like a child when everyone is helpless and defeated. He thinks how they can make it back to Earth but their original spaceship is bust and he is pretty sure that they cannot just build something out of all the metal bits and pieces scattered around. He wants to ask Mr. Stark what they should do next, what can they do next, but he keeps quiet. He has never seen Mr. Stark look so lost and afraid and, frankly, he needs to tear his eyes away because no one should see their hero look like that.</p><p>The entire time he had been in the ship and on this planet, Peter had forced himself not to dwell too much on thoughts of home, friends, and family. He needed to focus on the mission but now that they have failed, he could not help but let his thoughts go straight to those three things.</p><p>Peter cannot believe how much he misses Aunt May\u2019s (attempt at) cooking, Ned\u2019s constant movie references and eagerness to be the \u201cguy in the chair,\u201d and your complaints about your schoolmates and lessons. He does not want to think that there is no going back from this planet but after everything that is happened, Peter cannot find it in himself to be hopeful.</p><p>This is so bad. This is the worst thing that ever could have happened.</p><p>And it could have been prevented.</p><p>If only he had been stronger.</p><p>Peter has his head in his hands because he does not want his companions to see the look of utter defeat and despair on his face. Never mind the fact that they probably look the same way. He just needs to be alone with his thoughts right now. He tries to really focus on his memories, find comfort in dancing in the living room with Aunt May, beating Ned at a game of Mario Kart, and seeing juggle things in the air using your powers. He tries to remember the sounds of laughter, cheers of triumph, and whispers of promises.</p><p><i>Forever.</i></p><p>Peter cannot believe that he is breaking his promise to you.</p><p><i>Peter\u2026</i></p><p>Great, now you are haunting him.</p><p><i>Pe\u2026Peter\u2026</i></p><p>He looks up from his hands and turns around to scan his surroundings.</p><p>Doctor Strange. Mr. Stark. Mantis. Drax. New Blue Robot Lady. Star-Lord.</p><p><i>I\u2026I\u2026Peter\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a memory,\u201d Peter mumbles to himself and maybe his companions heard him but he cannot bring himself to meet their gaze because he can hear your voice and you are nowhere on this planet.</p><p><i>Lo\u2026ou\u2026Peter\u2026</i></p><p>Peter feels his heart fall to his stomach and he settles back down on his seat. He feels sick and not in the way that he has felt the entire time in space.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, kid?\u201d Mr. Stark asks and Peter looks at the man and suddenly he cannot stay strong anymore.</p><p>\u201cI lost,\u201d Peter whispers and he cannot believe how hard it is to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mr. Stark says and it sounds like an apology. \u201cWe all did.\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head but cannot bring himself to explain that yes, they lost the fight, but it feels like he has lost something more.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>You do not think you are dead because not only do you have a splitting headache (damn, what did you do before you passed out?), your mind is also filled with numerous thoughts that belong to you and those around. You feel nothing but pain and you think that maybe you should just stay wherever you are lest you injure yourself further. The voices in your head grow stronger, some of them shouts of victory and adrenaline while others are that off concern and exhaustion.</p><p>You feel a warmth on your belly and you feel Wanda\u2019s presence. You feel the pain in your side ebb away and you suddenly remember the tricks she has taught you during your time on the jet. You will your power to go to your wound and you help Wanda stitch you back together.</p><p>You are clumsy and you feel yourself let out gasps of pain but Wanda helps and before you know it, you feel yourself opening your eyes.</p><p>Everything is blurry and your throat feels dry. You are not sure if you are just thirsty or maybe you ate some dirt when you fell down. You do not want to think too much about it. You might just throw up.</p><p>The voices in your head seem far off now and you focus your attention to those closest to you.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d You hear Captain America ask and you do not need to read his mind to know that he is very tired.</p><p>\u201cShe will be,\u201d Wanda says and you feel like you could sleep for a hundred years. Maybe when you wake up, you could be the next Captain America.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid,\u201d Captain America says when you push yourself off the ground, keeping your cries muffled. \u201cYou can stand down now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll do that,\u201d you say with much effort and you try to relax against whatever it is that is behind you when you hear Vision let out a cry out pain. Wanda is immediately by his side and you feel a sense of dread wash over you, numbing you to your wounds.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Wanda asks and Vision lets out another sound of pain. \u201cWhat\u2026What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Vision replies, eyes wide and scanning the area.</p><p>You do not need to ask who it is. The wind patterns change and you look around the forest, trying to find out where Thanos is going to pop out from. Your eyes land on the space behind Dr. Banner and you watch as a blue portal appears behind him. Wanda is prepared to fight, red energy forming at her fingertips, and you force yourself to your feet, looking for things to use to attack.</p><p>Now is not the time to stand down.</p><p>Not while this monster is still around.</p><p>\u201cEyes up,\u201d Captain America says as he begins to make his way towards Thanos, \u201cStay sharp.\u201d</p><p>You watch from your place as Thanos easily defeats the Avengers, trapping Dr. Banner in stone, tossing Captain America aside, knocking out the Black Panther, and destroying the Falcon\u2019s wings. You immediately lose concentration and are scared. These are Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes and Thanos is going through them like they are nothing. You look to Wanda and Vision and see that although you are near them, you are not close enough to protect or be protected.</p><p>You see that the other Avengers are coming closer and you try to buy them some time by using all that is left in you to create a force field to keep Thanos from coming any closer.

He had slipped it off of his wrist and he was about to fall backwards when he felt that it was finally off of his hand when Thanos grabbed hold of the gauntlet just in time, making Peter fall backwards, onto the ground. He was so close. He nearly had it. If it were not for Star-Lord&mdash;no, Peter did not have time to think about that because Mantis had been thrown away like she was nothing and he is pretty sure she is not conscious. He leaps to his feet and goes after her, wrapping her in his arms and activating the Iron Spider&rsquo;s legs to help break their fall.</p><p>They land far away from the main fight and Peter can only watch the moment happen before him because the reality that maybe this is not the one outcome out of fourteen million that they win is hitting him so hard that he feels like he cannot breathe.</p><p>If he knew that this was going to be the end, he would have spent more time with Aunt May and Ned instead of going out at night, waiting for crime to happen. He would have visited you more at the X-Mansion, learned more about your time there, about your powers. Maybe he could have helped you out more, be it school or otherwise. He would have made more of an effort in school, maybe he would not have quit as many clubs as he did. Maybe he would have told MJ how he felt, maybe even hinted at it.</p><p>Peter thinks that he is too young to have so many regrets and he cannot bring himself to believe that this is the end of it all.</p><p>He is just about to gather his bearings, force himself to rejoin the fight, to help the adults out (oh my God, he really is just a kid compared to everyone here), when something crashes into the planet and sends everything and everyone flying. The gravitational pull of the planet seems to have been disturbed and Peter works fast to save his unconscious companions. He brings Mantis around with him, swinging around and avoiding debris, until he finds a place to web her to. He does the same for the others, quickly webbing them before the fly into orbit.</p><p>He regrets not knowing anyone&rsquo;s names.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Visions falls in a heap next to you and, for a moment, he thinks that the two of you are done for. Both your wounds are fatal and the alien monster has the upper hand. He need only to attack him once more, hit him where it would really hurt. Vision thinks he has just enough power in him to hold him off, he just has to, but Vision is not confident that he will last long. He thinks of a game plan, a way to save not only himself but you, when Captain Rogers appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and tackles the alien down.</p><p>&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; Captain Rogers orders him before he turns back to his opponent. Vision does not need to be told twice but he finds that he does not have it in him to push himself off the ground. He is in too much pain, too damaged. You are still unconscious next to him, eyes closed and barely breathing. You probably&mdash;desperately need medical attention.</p><p>Even if Vision could get himself to stand, he cannot bring you along with him if he manages to even walk.</p><p>&ldquo;GO!&rdquo; Captain Rogers urges when he sees that Vision is still in the same spot. Vision supposes that Captain Rogers has not caught sight of you or else he would have done something to help.</p><p>Vision forces himself to move once more, thinking of how to bring you along with him. It is his fault, really, that you are in the situation that you are in now. He thinks that, if you were awake, like all the other heroes, himself included, you would insist that it was your job.</p><p>If he makes it out of this fight alive, he makes a note to talk to Wanda about entrusting such a heavy responsibility to thirteen year olds.</p><p>Then again, if you were not around to help him, Vision does not think he would have made it this far.</p><p>Captain Rogers is able to disarm the alien, forcing the weapon to the ground. They fight hand to hand, moving further away from the weapon and Visions sees this as his chance. Instead of escaping, because honestly there is no way he can take you along with him, he makes a move towards the weapon, forcing himself to ignore the sharp shooting pain all over his body.</p><p>The alien pushes Captain Rogers to the ground and it looks like the hero is struggling to get himself free. Vision grabs hold of the weapon and in one swift movement, stabs the alien through his back. He pushes it further in, making sure that the blade is deep, and lifts him off of Captain Rogers before letting him fall to the side. The mere act takes all of Vision&rsquo;s energy and he falls to his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I told you to go,&rdquo; Captain Rogers says as he helps Vision to his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t trade lives, Captain,&rdquo; Vision tells him and although he is directing the comment to the hero, he is also talking about you. He jerks his head towards your direction and Captain Rogers swears under his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Is&hellip;is she alive?&rdquo; He asks and Visions does not know how he would react if he heard otherwise.</p><p>&ldquo;Just barely,&rdquo; Visions replies. &ldquo;She really held her own out here.&rdquo;</p><p>Captain Rogers shakes his head, not accepting the complement Vision pays you.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a kid.&rdquo;</p><p>And it is true. Vision cannot deny this especially when he sees you bleeding on the ground, very far away from home and everything that is familiar to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not think that matters during a war, Captain.&rdquo;</p><p>Captain Rogers&rsquo; lips form a tight line and Vision thinks that maybe he should have kept his mouth shut.</p><p>&ldquo;It should.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>There really was no way for Peter to jump into the fight Dr. Strange and Mr. Stark had with Thanos, but, by the end of it all, he really wished that he had at least tried. He was so far away, watching over the unconscious Guardians, and he honestly did not have a lot of fight left in him, but goddammit he should have been there.</p><p>If he had, maybe Mr. Stark would not have been stabbed.</p><p>If he had, maybe Dr. Strange would not have felt like he had no option but to give the Time stone to Thanos.</p><p>All the ifs and maybe circled Peter&rsquo;s mind as he, Mantis, and Drax followed Star-Lord&rsquo;s lead and made their way to Mr. Stark and Dr. Strange. Thanos is nowhere to be seen and all they can do now is sit on this blasted planet and lick their wounds.</p><p>This is not how Peter imagined his first fight as an Avenger to play out.</p><p>He wants to go home, he really, truly wants to go home, but he cannot start whining like a child when everyone is helpless and defeated. He thinks how they can make it back to Earth but their original spaceship is bust and he is pretty sure that they cannot just build something out of all the metal bits and pieces scattered around. He wants to ask Mr. Stark what they should do next, what can they do next, but he keeps quiet. He has never seen Mr. Stark look so lost and afraid and, frankly, he needs to tear his eyes away because no one should see their hero look like that.</p><p>The entire time he had been in the ship and on this planet, Peter had forced himself not to dwell too much on thoughts of home, friends, and family. He needed to focus on the mission but now that they have failed, he could not help but let his thoughts go straight to those three things.</p><p>Peter cannot believe how much he misses Aunt May&rsquo;s (attempt at) cooking, Ned&rsquo;s constant movie references and eagerness to be the &ldquo;guy in the chair,&rdquo; and your complaints about your schoolmates and lessons. He does not want to think that there is no going back from this planet but after everything that is happened, Peter cannot find it in himself to be hopeful.</p><p>This is so bad. This is the worst thing that ever could have happened.</p><p>And it could have been prevented.</p><p>If only he had been stronger.</p><p>Peter has his head in his hands because he does not want his companions to see the look of utter defeat and despair on his face. Never mind the fact that they probably look the same way. He just needs to be alone with his thoughts right now. He tries to really focus on his memories, find comfort in dancing in the living room with Aunt May, beating Ned at a game of Mario Kart, and seeing juggle things in the air using your powers. He tries to remember the sounds of laughter, cheers of triumph, and whispers of promises.</p><p><i>Forever.</i></p><p>Peter cannot believe that he is breaking his promise to you.</p><p><i>Peter&hellip;</i></p><p>Great, now you are haunting him.</p><p><i>Pe&hellip;Peter&hellip;</i></p><p>He looks up from his hands and turns around to scan his surroundings.</p><p>Doctor Strange. Mr. Stark. Mantis. Drax. New Blue Robot Lady. Star-Lord.</p><p><i>I&hellip;I&hellip;Peter&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a memory,&rdquo; Peter mumbles to himself and maybe his companions heard him but he cannot bring himself to meet their gaze because he can hear your voice and you are nowhere on this planet.</p><p><i>Lo&hellip;ou&hellip;Peter&hellip;</i></p><p>Peter feels his heart fall to his stomach and he settles back down on his seat. He feels sick and not in the way that he has felt the entire time in space.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay, kid?&rdquo; Mr. Stark asks and Peter looks at the man and suddenly he cannot stay strong anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;I lost,&rdquo; Peter whispers and he cannot believe how hard it is to get the words out.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Mr. Stark says and it sounds like an apology. &ldquo;We all did.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shakes his head but cannot bring himself to explain that yes, they lost the fight, but it feels like he has lost something more.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>You do not think you are dead because not only do you have a splitting headache (damn, what did you do before you passed out?), your mind is also filled with numerous thoughts that belong to you and those around. You feel nothing but pain and you think that maybe you should just stay wherever you are lest you injure yourself further. The voices in your head grow stronger, some of them shouts of victory and adrenaline while others are that off concern and exhaustion.</p><p>You feel a warmth on your belly and you feel Wanda&rsquo;s presence. You feel the pain in your side ebb away and you suddenly remember the tricks she has taught you during your time on the jet. You will your power to go to your wound and you help Wanda stitch you back together.</p><p>You are clumsy and you feel yourself let out gasps of pain but Wanda helps and before you know it, you feel yourself opening your eyes.</p><p>Everything is blurry and your throat feels dry. You are not sure if you are just thirsty or maybe you ate some dirt when you fell down. You do not want to think too much about it. You might just throw up.</p><p>The voices in your head seem far off now and you focus your attention to those closest to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Is she going to be okay?&rdquo; You hear Captain America ask and you do not need to read his mind to know that he is very tired.</p><p>&ldquo;She will be,&rdquo; Wanda says and you feel like you could sleep for a hundred years. Maybe when you wake up, you could be the next Captain America.</p><p>&ldquo;You did good, kid,&rdquo; Captain America says when you push yourself off the ground, keeping your cries muffled. &ldquo;You can stand down now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; you say with much effort and you try to relax against whatever it is that is behind you when you hear Vision let out a cry out pain. Wanda is immediately by his side and you feel a sense of dread wash over you, numbing you to your wounds.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Wanda asks and Vision lets out another sound of pain. &ldquo;What&hellip;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Vision replies, eyes wide and scanning the area.</p><p>You do not need to ask who it is. The wind patterns change and you look around the forest, trying to find out where Thanos is going to pop out from. Your eyes land on the space behind Dr. Banner and you watch as a blue portal appears behind him. Wanda is prepared to fight, red energy forming at her fingertips, and you force yourself to your feet, looking for things to use to attack.</p><p>Now is not the time to stand down.</p><p>Not while this monster is still around.</p><p>&ldquo;Eyes up,&rdquo; Captain America says as he begins to make his way towards Thanos, &ldquo;Stay sharp.&rdquo;</p><p>You watch from your place as Thanos easily defeats the Avengers, trapping Dr. Banner in stone, tossing Captain America aside, knocking out the Black Panther, and destroying the Falcon&rsquo;s wings. You immediately lose concentration and are scared. These are Earth&rsquo;s Mightiest Heroes and Thanos is going through them like they are nothing. You look to Wanda and Vision and see that although you are near them, you are not close enough to protect or be protected.</p><p>You see that the other Avengers are coming closer and you try to buy them some time by using all that is left in you to create a force field to keep Thanos from coming any closer. He nearly stops in his tracks, sensing the invisible barrier, and you almost feel victories when looks eyes with you. You try to push him back, you really do, but it is a futile attempt. He moves his hand in a motion that causes you to fly the opposite direction and land painfully on the ground. You try to get up but you feel the roots of the trees wrap around your arms, legs, and neck, and you know that you are defeated.</p><p>All you can do is listen to the grunts of pain from the Avengers as well as the cries from Wanda and Vision.</p><p>You close your eyes, waiting for the end to come.</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/185061194901/its-hard-when-youre-young-peter-parker-x-reader\"></a><a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/185061194901/its-hard-when-youre-young-peter-parker-x-reader\">Part 22: Powerless</a></p><hr /><hr /><p><i>Taglist:</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIj52RC0XuSI6RcDC3_avug\">@xazu-ravenx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CmXuriy8t5caMStNuDaoQ\">@call-me-latte</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1P3msgsxO-Noc_jKlZKaPg\">@a-sunflower-sun</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbWnoS8kcQ-mmjGIamDWURg\">@duliz2014</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw4VjWrJEWr6WwBBMVBykcw\">@arisu003</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jpsUIfZHmT4_9ISd-kVKQ\">@slideseok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTY7MShbhiNb3Hauh3PpZA\">@niiamh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVRFoZYlCu8XDZ0nMvI8adw\">@intoomuchfandoms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzisYX8eqaV2l0raAyirelA\">@naturallyspontaneous</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnEBBWEAS-ky9AAIvck1ezQ\">@jimenatateyama</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-MFXpt1YV2wmNXQw0C9gQ\">@le-yona</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGs7qK6Vo81-rq7k3q4tONA\">@clint-bartxn99</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\">@kewl-r</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnoSxDk7r4DKrNxtGOj5jlw\">@autobotgirl15-blog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8RopNrvvyXKaF265RSVNXw\">@peter-spider-parker-man</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfkPfAyQgusMXCuj6SCob5A\">@redgemsposts</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muvpc7UiYHeXGUf5LhZj3MA\">@shantayok</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3fiyOXF_Q2PcFTV-Xi-2cg\">@throughlytired</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNX5ZZN90g-LRU5oJlZg6AQ\">@sk-o-mp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCSNlsBXojzIby9-m21lQTw\">@amb-q</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnJc3qUZdf4ThjsWqbDC1MQ\">@justfuxxingkillmealready</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjGA2SF0yjFFzEHVftwHPjg\">@spidey-quackson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBCr_bgyyEWgP4rzIVbOkQ\">@sketchcole</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJSpsgywe-IH9XI2oxhBqsQ\">@patat-boi</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWe-Gim3fCT58hc3c2V62yA\">@waywaya</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV155O6iryeIB1bzRvtXHXw\">@akira-0229</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFeag8NmH4_6GfQ2hXDmArg\">@yunggenoalpha</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL5ioo93YPr5IXYLdpa_N9w\">@alina-margaret</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnGf32jLkXSykoj5olbM7hg\">@astromilku</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnqojvhOI5PW669I4MMuSKA\">@thewaywarddaughter1967</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msGaFxudFWLw_ENpXzP1AJQ\">@minetticatinwonderland</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://softcrybabyboy.tumblr.com/\" title=\"ants and my ex's PP are the same size\">softcrybabyboy</a>&nbsp; @<a href=\"https://jeonginorjeongjin.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I was a daydreamer, but now I'm just lost in you\">jeonginorjeongjin</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://bees-are-so-great.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Bees&#128029;\">bees-are-so-great</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://holyhumorliteraturelight.tumblr.com/\" title=\"BUCKY IS NOT A VILLAIN\">holyhumorliteraturelight</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://quirkyepicgamer.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Dumb\">quirkyepicgamer</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://shortpeoplematter.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Shorty\">shortpeoplematter</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://ipomea-alba-moonvine.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Untitled\">ipomea-alba-moonvine</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://shirukitsune.tumblr.com/\">shirukitsune</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://lilah427.tumblr.com/\">lilah427</a></i></p><p><i>Want to join the <a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/184700973876/fan-fic-taglist\">taglist</a>?</i></p>",

You wince when\nyour bruised hip brushes against your desk as you walk towards the door and\nimmediately put on an impassive face to hide the fact that your entire body is\naching.</p><p>Walking out the door,\nyou smile at your dad and notice the person sitting next to him on the couch.\nWhen he turns around to wave at you, your jaw drops.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re\nTony Stark. The real Tony Stark, holy cow,\u201d you blurt out, eyes wide. \u201cDad,\nthat\u2019s Tony Stark sitting next to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am Tony Stark,\u201d he says through a grin as\nthough it\u2019s obvious. Well, now that you think about it, it\u00a0<i>is</i>\u00a0obvious and you\u2019ve just made a fool of yourself\nin front of Tony <i>freaking</i> Stark. \u201cI\u2019m\nhere about the internship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternship?\u201d you\nmumble, confused. \u201cLike the actual Stark internship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, isn\u2019t Peter\ndoing that?\u201d your dad pipes in.</p><p>\u201cUh, Peter\u00a0<i>Parker</i>? A little\nawkward, talks a lot, loves making pop culture references?\u201d asks Tony, shifting\nuncomfortably. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my best\nfriend,\u201d you nod, a pit of guilt forming in your stomach at the mention of\nPeter. You\u2019ve been neglecting him for weeks because you\u2019re always too bruised\nup or tired to hang out recently. He probably feels the distance considering he\nhasn\u2019t been asking to meet up either, you note. \u201cYou want me to do that\ninternship?\u201d you ask dubiously. You haven\u2019t even signed up for it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been emailing each other about it, remember? I decided to\ntake you up on it,\u201d Tony smiles, glancing at your Dad quickly to see that he\u2019s\nlooking at you, perplexed. And then Tony winks at you frantically. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you start off slowly, eyes narrowed. \u201cThe\u2026 the emails,\nyeah. I applied for the internship as well. I, uh, didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get it so I\ndidn\u2019t bother telling you, Dad. S-surprise?\u201d you try for a casual chuckle.</p><p>To your shock, he just shrugs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy for you, it sounds\ngood!\u201d your dad nods encouragingly. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, would it be okay to speak to Y/N alone?\u201d Tony\npolitely asks, standing up from the couch.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll just be in the kitchen,\u201d your Dad responds, shaking\nTony Stark\u2019s hand before making his way out. </p><p>Looking at Tony suspiciously, you say, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in my room if you\nneed us.\u201d </p><p>Gesturing for him to follow you, the two of you walk towards your\ndoor and you swallow nervously about why he\u2019s here. It\u2019s a good thing you\nremembered to put concealer on your face today.</p><p>As you take a seat nervously on the edge of your bed, Tony shuts\nthe door behind him. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve probably guessed there\u2019s no internship for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Really?\u201d you feign ignorance. \u201cThat\u2019s surprising\nconsidering the fact that I <i>never applied</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that,\u201d he sighs, forming a temple with his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m\njust going to get straight to it. I know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of assumed that when you said my name,\u201d you roll\nyour eyes to fake nonchalance when in actuality, your heart is pounding against\nyour chest. He can\u2019t mean what you think he means.</p><p>\u201cFunny. You\u2019re a funny one, you remind me of Peter,\u201d he\nsays, but you guess that he\u2019s being sarcastic. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d you keep an impassive face, causing Tony to\nsnort. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>A knowing smirk on his face, Tony pulls out his phone and\ntypes for a few seconds. Then, with a flick of his finger, he pulls up a\nrecording of New York city at night. </p><p>Your palms become clammy when a lithe and slender figure\ncomes into view, standing on the edge of a building. Dressed in all black, the\nfigure jumps from the building and lands perfectly before an electronics store\nand walking in. You watch with bated breath as the video cuts to when a glowing\nlight fills up the store and a couple of thieves walk out, empty handed. </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s the, uh, Supernova girl,\u201d you swallow, squinting\nat the video. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so how\u2019d you do that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d you splutter, eyes wide. \u201cThat\u2019s not me, I\u2019m just a\nhigh school student!\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tony takes a seat next to you. \u201cDoes Peter\nknow? Does your Dad even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d you shout, without thinking. Wincing at how you just\ngave yourself a way, you bury your face in your hands. \u201cNeither of them can\nknow anything. They\u2019d be so worried, you don\u2019t even understand. Everyone <i>know</i>s you\u2019re Iron-Man. People at school would\nfreak out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that, you don\u2019t have to tell them,\u201d he nods, looking\nas though he wants to say something else. \u201cDo you know Spider-Man, by any\nchance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of him and I\u2019ve seen him around,\u201d you furrow your\nbrows at the odd question. \u201cBut I work alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow <i>do</i> you work?\u201d\nTony asks, crossing his arms and looking curious. \u201cLike, what makes people just\nlisten to you and stop being criminals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you simply shrug, being truthful. \u201cOne day,\nI went out late at night to sit in the park and draw. Then I saw some weird,\nglowing piece of debris fell out of the sky and went to see. As soon as I\ntouched it, I blacked out and woke up in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Tony wrinkles his nose, dismissive. \u201cNot the weirdest\nthing I\u2019ve ever heard. So, what? You stare into people\u2019s eyes and they just do\nwhat you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and all my senses are heightened. It\u2019s\u2026 really weird,\nbut all I do is help little thefts and things around the neighbourhood. Nothing\nlike Spider-Man and you with the Avengers,\u201d you clarify hastily. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking of that, how would you feel about joining the\nAvengers?\u201d</p><p>You blink. </p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d you mumble, not believing your ears. \u201cYou want\nme to join the <i>Avengers</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d he states, looking expectant. \u201cI won\u2019t ask\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you exhale, heart racing. \u201cYes, of course, a thousand\ntimes yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a lot easier than he was,\u201d Tony mutters, raising\nan eyebrow. You decide not to question who he\u2019s talking about, still a little\nshaken. \u201cWhere\u2019s your suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-my suit? I just wear a black hoodie and leggings most of\nthe time\u2026\u201d you trail off when you spot the horrified look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou go around fighting criminals in <i>a hoodie and leggings</i>? You do realise you could get hurt in this\njob,\u201d his demeanour becomes serious and almost parental as though he\u2019s scolding\nyou. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to send a suit then, be prepared to get one in the\nmail.\u201d</p><p>Before you have any chance to speak or even thank him for\nmaking you a suit, Tony stands up and walks towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll send you\ndetails via an actual email this time and we\u2019ll see if you\u2019re fit to be an\nAvenger, kid.\u201d</p><p>Stomach churning- from excitement or nerves, you don\u2019t know-\nyou quickly stop him before he turns the handle. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell my Dad, will\nyou?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he assures you, but then adds as an\nafterthought, \u201cunless you get seriously hurt. You gotta remember that I\u2019m\nresponsible for your life now and I can\u2019t take any risks with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair, but\u2026 you won\u2019t tell Peter either, right? I\nmean, he probably sees you guys whenever he goes there for the internship. I\ncan\u2019t let him know either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony nods his head, awkwardly tapping his hands\nagainst the handle of your door. \u201cThe internship. Your secret is safe with me,\u201d\nhe mimes zipping his mouth and throwing away the key which causes you to let\nout a sigh of relief. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr Stark,\u201d you offer him a smile as you open your door.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s go and lie our asses off to my Dad.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prviqpgPMi1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"/></figure><p>For someone who jumps off of buildings and faces numerous\ncriminals who hold guns to your face, you really shouldn\u2019t be this nervous. </p><p><i>They\u2019re just the\nAvengers</i>, you tell yourself. How intimidating can they possibly be?</p><p>Using the pass that Tony gave you, along with the protective\nsuit he made, you make your way into the building known as the Avengers Tower. </p><p>As you pass into the elevator, you catch sight of your\nreflection. The new outfit feels foreign, but at the same time it feels like <i>you</i>. The all black theme of the\nfigure-hugging suit makes you feel light and weightless- not as restrictive as your\nhoodie, but it\u2019s paired with a thin hood that veils your hair, staying in place\nand a mask that covers the lower part of your face. </p><p>For dramatic purposes only, you decided to outline your eyes\nin a deep, black liner as soon as you got home from school, which is a huge\ncontrast to your usually makeup free face. Admiring how different you look from\nyour usual self, you almost don\u2019t notice the elevator stop and the agent waiting\noutside. </p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Agent Hill,\u201d the woman extends her hand to you with\na polite smile as you step outside the elevator. \u201cTony has told me all about\nyou, and the team are highly anticipating your arrival.\u201d</p><p>She starts a brisk pace and you quickly run to catch up,\nstomach fluttering from anxiety. \u201cA-all of them?\u201d you say, but curse inwardly\nas soon as you realise you sound like a little kid. So much for showing you can\nbe mature. </p><p>\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t worry,\u201d she laughs, waving it off. \u201cYou\naren\u2019t the only teenager, remember?\u201d</p><p>Furrowing your brows, your silence causes Agent Hill to\nglance at you when you turn a corner. \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d she says as though the one\nname is an explanation. A shake of your head leads her to elaborate. \u201cHe\u2019s the\nsame age as you, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d you laugh, nervously. You\u2019re glad your face is\nmostly covered by your mask so that Hill can\u2019t see your shock written plain as\nday all over your face. \u201cI do know that Peter Parker is around here a lot\nbecause of the Stark Internship, do you know him by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014You don\u2019t\u2026 Uhm. Yeah,\u201d she stumbles over her words,\nclearing her throat quickly. \u201cYes, I do know him.\u201d</p><p>Her short and confusing response does nothing to calm you\nabout the possibility that your identity may accidentally be revealed to your\nunknowing best friend. \u201cJust a small favour\u2026 If Peter is ever here, he can\u2019t\nknow my real name.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep, understood,\u201d her answer comes clipped and she starts\nwalking faster. You soon reach a large door, which Agent Hill stops in front of.\n\u201cHere we are. Ready?\u201d</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, you nod, bracing yourself for this\nmeeting. Agent Hill opens the door after muttering a couple words into her\nearpiece that you don\u2019t quite catch.</p><p>As soon as the Avengers come into sight, you have to physically\nforce yourself not to let out a scream. </p><p>\u201cHey, Supernova,\u201d Tony smiles proudly when he sees the powerful\neffect his suit seems to have in making you look like an actual superhero.\n\u201cMeet the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d you mutter, barely audible as you wave an awkward hand\nin lieu of greeting. \u201cI-I\u2019m Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve Rogers,\u201d says Captain America, stepping forward to\nshake your hand. </p><p><i>Holy crap, you just\nshook hands with Captain America. </i>\u201cOh, I know all of your names already,\u201d you\nclarify, bringing forth laughter from them all. </p><p>Sweeping a quick gaze across the room, you notice that apart\nfrom the original six Avengers, there\u2019s Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Scarlet Witch and\nVision. Most of them being preoccupied with their own business, you inch a\nlittle closer to Tony who\u2019s the only person you know well.</p><p>Before you can think about who\u2019s missing, Natasha cuts in.\n\u201cTony, isn\u2019t she a little young? You want her to come on the latest mission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d you quickly defend, not wanting\nto be labelled as a little kid on your first day of being here. </p><p>\u201cWe have no doubts about that,\u201d Steve adds kindly. \u201cBut you\nhave family and friends and school to think about too. You aren\u2019t as expendable\nas some of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually the same age as\u2014\u201d Tony starts off but is\ninterrupted by someone running into the room. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>You notice that the person rushing down with his backpack on\nhis bag is none other than the red and blue clad figure of Spider-Man. </p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, I just got off school and had to stop some\ncreep in an alleyway from annoying this woman, so I got a little held up and\u2014 woah,\nwho\u2019s this?\u201d he comes at a stop in front of you. </p><p>His voice is so familiar that you don\u2019t answer. Instead, you\nstare, dumbfounded at who\u2019s voice you think you\u2019re hearing. No\u2026 It can\u2019t be. </p><p>Vaguely in the background you hear someone introduce you as\nSupernova, to which he responds with, \u201cOh, cool, they told me you\u2019d be coming!\nI\u2019m Spider-Man, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Taking off his mask, you find yourself face to face with\nnone other than your best friend himself.</p><p>\u201cP-peter?\u201d you exhale, finding yourself paralysed. </p><p>He raises a brow, perplexed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my name. Why do\nyou sound so shocked?\u201d he asks, chuckling.</p><p>Hands trembling, you lift your hands to your mask,\nhesitating for a second before removing it. </p><p>He stares for a second, smile fading.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he whispers, his mask falling out of his grasp and\nonto the floor. \u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> Supernova? Wha\u2014\nwhy the fuck didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he exclaims, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Why didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019re Spider-Man?\u201d you fire\nback, equally as irked. </p><p>\u201cI asked first!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2014?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you two know each other?\u201d Sam cuts you off, looking\namused. </p><p>Glaring daggers into Peter once more before looking to Sam,\nyou cross your arms. \u201cYes, he\u2019s my supposed best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s gotta be awkward,\u201d Clint shakes his head in\nsympathy of your situation and the others hum in agreement. </p><p>\u201c<i>Supposed</i>?\u201d Peter\nscoffs and you stare him straight in the eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that you\u2019ve been lying to your best friend about\nthe Stark Internship! Speaking of that,\u201d you look at Tony to see he\u2019s\npretending to be preoccupied with some gadget. \u201cMr Stark, would you like to\nexplain yourself now? Why didn\u2019t you tell me you knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, Tony knew?\u201d Bruce pipes up, momentarily looking over\nfrom his table and raising his eyebrows, at the man in question. \u201cThis is on\nyou, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey!\u201d he raises his hands in surrender, wincing when\nhe sees you and Peter looking expectantly for an answer. \u201cIn my defence, I knew\nyou\u2019d find out eventually and you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t exactly doing me a favour,\u201d you scowl, blood\nboiling at the fact that he kept such a huge secret from you. Well, so did you,\nbut that\u2019s not the point.</p><p>Whipping around to look at you, Peter looks furious, but\nafter knowing him for so long you can tell that he\u2019s also little hurt. \u201cWe\naren\u2019t going to talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a little pissed if you hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d you reply,\ncurtly and he laughs without a trace of humour at this.</p><p>\u201cOh, you think I\u2019m happy that one of the people most\nimportant to me is risking her life every day and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Peter asks\nthis with a disbelieving tone and your heart aches with a pang. </p><p>Okay, <i>now</i> you feel\nguilty. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realise you\u2019re also important to me? And you\u2019re\nconstantly in greater danger, so how am I meant to live with that?\u201d</p><p>Natasha lowers her voice and mumbles something to Steve, but\nyou manage to make it out anyway. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re arguing or making\nup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d he sighs, walking closer to you. \u201cAnd unless\nyou guys sort something out, neither of you are coming on this mission. I\u2019m\npairing you together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Peter says with a serious expression at the same\ntime that you exclaim otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you throw your hands up in frustration. \u201cDo you know\nwhat that\u2019s gonna be like? He literally acts like my mother half the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not just say that, Y/N, <i>tell</i> me you did not just say that,\u201d Peter groans, covering his face\nwith one hand in exasperation. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t so annoyingly protective when I\u2019m\nperfectly capable of looking out for myself\u2026\u201d you trail off, shooting him a\nlook. </p><p>Steve rolls his eyes at your back and forth argument and\nTony just lets out a low whistle. When you catch Natasha\u2019s eye, she has a little\nsmirk playing on her face. She raises her eyebrows. Before you can inquire,\nBruce walks over from his table of maps and papers along with the rest of the\nteam. </p><p>\u201cAlright, we have a plan and we just have to debrief you all\non it now. The general idea is that we go in and disable the HYDRA weapon\nwhilst also taking out any agents on the outside. I don\u2019t know if we can even\ncall them HYDRA, they\u2019re just a bunch of psychos trying to keep the\norganisation going, but they\u2019re dangerous nonetheless. Y/N, listen closely\nsince this is your first time,\u201d Bruce informs you and the excitement makes you\nhold in a smile. </p><p>\n \n \n\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvirm7XAc1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"/></figure><p>\u201cI TOLD YOU TO GO LEFT!\u201d Peter screams through the earpiece\nwhen you land with a thump on your side next to a tree. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go <i>left</i>\nwhen there\u2019s someone with a gun trying to shoot at me <i>from the same side</i>,\u201d you groan, lifting yourself up from the ground\nand immediately whipping around to stop a blow from an agent, locking his arm\nin your hold and staring him in the eyes. Straight away his own pupils begin to\nglow and his hold relaxes, posture straightening and you can now tell him what\nto do. </p><p>\u201cBe a sweetheart and take down some of your own men, will\nyou?\u201d you smile and he nods in a trance, walking away with his gun. </p><p>\u201cGood job, Y/N,\u201d Steve says from inside the building,\npanting from exertion. \u201cWe\u2019re almost done so try and stay low now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Cap,\u201d you respond, just as Peter lands next to\nyou from goodness knows where. </p><p>Taking off his mask, Peter stares at you in amazement. \u201cThat\nwas awesome! All you have to do is look at them? Do they even remember\nafterwards? Wait, have you ever tried to do that to me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, no and no,\u201d you list off the answers to his question,\nbut then add with a teasing tone, \u201cbut who\u2019s to say I won\u2019t do it in the future?\nWatch out, Parker,\u201d you whisper the last bit and Peter\u2019s eyes widen as he stays\nsilent. </p><p>Suddenly a voice sounds through the earpiece and makes you\ncrack a smile. \u201cY/N, you\u2019re scaring the kid,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice sounds vaguely\npreoccupied and you hear a few grunts and shots going off in the background. </p><p>\u201cMr Stark, do you need help?\u201d Peter asks, worry lacing his\nvoice and the two of you straighten up, ready to go and help. </p><p>\u201cNope, just finishing up.\u201d A loud clang of metal resounds\nmaking you and Peter wince. \u201cGetting ready to leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, web-slinger, can you grab Y/N and bring her to the\nship?\u201d Natasha yells over the sound of whirring machinery which makes you\nassume she\u2019s already on board. </p><p>Putting his mask back on, Peter wraps a hand around your waist\ntightly and you cling on for dear life. Where his hands are placed, you feel heat\nsearing through the material of your suit and it makes your cheeks warm up.\nConsidering this isn\u2019t the first time, you push the feeling down and swallow\nharshly. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asks, hand extended upwards. </p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d And then he shoots, lifting you off the ground to\nweb his way to the ship. You keep your eyes shut the entire way, wind blowing\naround your hood. Within seconds you find yourself standing inside the ship as\nthe exit closes slowly. </p><p>You lean on Peter for support as you get your bearings\nstraight, swaying from slight dizziness. \u201cOkay I never want to do that again.\u201d</p><p>He just chuckles in response and the two of you walk into\nthe main room where the others are gathered, most of them seated from the\nexhaustion of the mission. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are getting old,\u201d Peter snickers into his fist as\nyou and him seem to be the only ones who aren\u2019t showing effects of running\naround in combat. \u201cAlso, web-slinger? Really?\u201d he directs this at Natasha with\nraised eyebrows and an unimpressed air while she just smirks, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid,\u201d Tony nods at you, seeming to be\nsatisfied with your work and pride blooms in your chest at his praise. You get\nthe feeling he doesn\u2019t offer it much. \u201cWelcome to the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean she gets to stay over whenever she wants?\u201d\nPeter asks hopefully, but the question makes you fold your arms and furrow your\nbrows.</p><p>\u201cHang on, is this why you\u2019re never home anymore? You stay\nhere all the time?\u201d you scoff, shaking your head in irritation. The amount of\ntimes you decided to pay him a visit when you had a spare moment just to find\nout he wasn\u2019t home is ridiculous, you think to yourself. </p><p>\u201cNot all the time!\u201d he\u2019s quick to defend himself, raising\nhis hands as though you\u2019re pointing a gun at him. \u201cI can\u2019t just leave May by\nherself all the time, I\u2019m only here some weekends! Plus, she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Aunt May before me?\u201d you narrow your eyes\nsuspiciously and you can feel everyone\u2019s eyes moving from you to Peter, back\nand forth as you talk. \u201cWho else knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe found out by accident and so did Ned!\u201d he rushes to\nexplain, but upon realising what he just said, he stops and looks like a deer\ncaught in the headlights.</p><p>Taken aback, you inhale once deeply. \u201c<i>Ned knows</i>? And you didn\u2019t tell <i>me</i>?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHave I fucked up?\u201d Peter whispers frightfully to no one in\nparticular as you glare at him with all the anger you can muster. </p><p>Before you can say that yes, he has fucked up, Natasha\ninterrupts. \u201cCareful, Steve doesn\u2019t like that kind of language, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNat, I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n \n \n\u201c<i>Language</i>.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvirtMIQG1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"/></figure><p>Sweat drips down your forehead as you continuously fire\npunches in Peter\u2019s direction, only to be met with air as he dodges them,\nturning up behind you to sweep you off your feet. Literally. </p><p>You grunt, twisting around to lie on your back for what\nfeels like the hundredth time. This isn\u2019t your first training session after you\njoined the Avengers and you definitely underestimated how hard it would be.\nFrom missions to sparring with Nat to surprise scenarios to test you it was physically\ndraining, but you had to admit that you were starting to feel at home in the\nfamily like environment. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if this was a real fight, I\u2019d just look at you\nand make you walk away,\u201d you complain, taking his hand when he offers it to\nlift you off the ground. </p><p>He shrugs at this, giving you an apologetic smile. \u201cCap says\nyou have to be prepared to fight without your powers, so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d you roll your shoulders and stand in a\nfighting stance. You gotta say you\u2019re getting tired of this. \u201cCap can\u2019t control\npeople with his eyes now, can he?\u201d</p><p>Then, you lunge. </p><p>Peter catches your first fist in one hand, but stumbles when\nyou kick into his side before grabbing hold of your leg and pulling you\nforward. </p><p>\u201cWoah,\u201d you gasp, falling into his chest with a force that\nknocks your breath away. That, combined with the fact his face is only inches\nfrom yours. </p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d he whispers, lightly chuckling. With your leg\nwrapped around him and his hand on your thigh you can\u2019t seem to think straight\nand you stutter, at a loss for words. When his eyes flicker down to your lips\nfor a split second, your mind goes into overdrive and a bubble of nervous\nlaughter escapes you. </p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d you whisper, eyes wide and stomach fluttering.\n\u201cIf this was in the middle of a fight, we\u2019d be dead by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing we\u2019re alone then, huh?\u201d Peter exhales and when\nhis nose brushes against yours, you realise how little the space between you\nhas become and how his lips are too far from yours for your liking. </p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s good because\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it means I can kiss you,\u201d he says and then\nimmediately closes the distance that was separating you by pressing his lips\nagainst yours. </p><p>As his hand travels up your thigh to rest on your hip, the\nother cupping the side of your face as he kisses you, you fight back a shiver.\nTrailing a hand up his abdomen, you grip his shoulder as he deepens the kiss\nand you melt into his hold, humming contentedly.</p><p>You feel him smiling into the kiss before he breaks away to\nrest his forehead against your own. </p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t out of line, was it?\u201d Peter asks a little\nbreathlessly, looking up at you through his eyelashes. \u201cI mean, you didn\u2019t push\nme away, so that\u2019s gotta count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I kissed you back, dumbass,\u201d you respond, playfully rolling\nyour eyes as you nudge his shoulder with your hand that rests there. \u201cIt kind\nof means that I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you do?\u201d he repeats with wide eyes as if he\u2019s a little\nunsure. You can also tell that underlying his expression of uncertainty is a\nsmile that\u2019s waiting to break through. </p><p>Grinning widely at this, you take his hand in your own and\nintertwine your fingers. \u201cYeah, I would have thought it was pretty obvious by\nnow, but clearly you\u2019re just as clueless! But\u2026this isn\u2019t going to be weird now,\nis it? We haven\u2019t ruined our friendship now, have we?\u201d your smile fades a little\nas you add this on, suddenly considering the situation. Your friendship with Peter\nis the most important thing you share and you\u2019d never do anything to put it at\nrisk. </p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t weird unless you make it weird,\u201d he reassures you,\nreciprocating your exuberance at the newfound confession that hangs between\nyou. \u201cAnd yeah, we have ruined our friendship, but that can be easily fixed.\u201d</p><p>You tilt your head in questioning, furrowing your brows. \u201cHow\u2019s\nthat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my girlfriend?\u201d his voice comes out slightly doubtful, making\nit sound like a question as he sheepishly runs a hand through his hair. </p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re my boyfriend then,\u201d you fight back a smile,\nbut fail as soon as Peter\u2019s eyes light up and he laughs with delight, leaning\nin to press another kiss against your lips.</p><p>Just as your eyes flutter shut and Peter\u2019s hands thread into\nyour hair, you hear a voice that makes you jump, startling you out of Peter\u2019s\nhold.</p><p>\u201cClint, you owe me ten bucks!\u201d you hear Natasha call out\nfrom somewhere outside the training room and your jaw drops, appalled that the Earth\u2019s\nMightiest Heroes <i>bet on you</i>.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2013 l don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d you can\u2019t help but shake\nyour head and laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of the situation. </p><p>\u201cAre you honestly surprised?\u201d </p><p> \u201cNah, not really.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvis0VChu1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"/></figure><p><b>\n\n\u00a9 spideystans | 2019. no copying or reposting without permission on any platforms</b><br/></p>",

You\u2019ve been neglecting him for weeks because you\u2019re always too bruised\nup or tired to hang out recently. He probably feels the distance considering he\nhasn\u2019t been asking to meet up either, you note. \u201cYou want me to do that\ninternship?\u201d you ask dubiously. You haven\u2019t even signed up for it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been emailing each other about it, remember? I decided to\ntake you up on it,\u201d Tony smiles, glancing at your Dad quickly to see that he\u2019s\nlooking at you, perplexed. And then Tony winks at you frantically. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you start off slowly, eyes narrowed. \u201cThe\u2026 the emails,\nyeah. I applied for the internship as well. I, uh, didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get it so I\ndidn\u2019t bother telling you, Dad. S-surprise?\u201d you try for a casual chuckle.</p><p>To your shock, he just shrugs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy for you, it sounds\ngood!\u201d your dad nods encouragingly. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, would it be okay to speak to Y/N alone?\u201d Tony\npolitely asks, standing up from the couch.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll just be in the kitchen,\u201d your Dad responds, shaking\nTony Stark\u2019s hand before making his way out. </p><p>Looking at Tony suspiciously, you say, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in my room if you\nneed us.\u201d </p><p>Gesturing for him to follow you, the two of you walk towards your\ndoor and you swallow nervously about why he\u2019s here. It\u2019s a good thing you\nremembered to put concealer on your face today.</p><p>As you take a seat nervously on the edge of your bed, Tony shuts\nthe door behind him. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve probably guessed there\u2019s no internship for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Really?\u201d you feign ignorance. \u201cThat\u2019s surprising\nconsidering the fact that I <i>never applied</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that,\u201d he sighs, forming a temple with his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m\njust going to get straight to it. I know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of assumed that when you said my name,\u201d you roll\nyour eyes to fake nonchalance when in actuality, your heart is pounding against\nyour chest. He can\u2019t mean what you think he means.</p><p>\u201cFunny. You\u2019re a funny one, you remind me of Peter,\u201d he\nsays, but you guess that he\u2019s being sarcastic. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d you keep an impassive face, causing Tony to\nsnort. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>A knowing smirk on his face, Tony pulls out his phone and\ntypes for a few seconds. Then, with a flick of his finger, he pulls up a\nrecording of New York city at night. </p><p>Your palms become clammy when a lithe and slender figure\ncomes into view, standing on the edge of a building. Dressed in all black, the\nfigure jumps from the building and lands perfectly before an electronics store\nand walking in. You watch with bated breath as the video cuts to when a glowing\nlight fills up the store and a couple of thieves walk out, empty handed. </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s the, uh, Supernova girl,\u201d you swallow, squinting\nat the video. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so how\u2019d you do that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d you splutter, eyes wide. \u201cThat\u2019s not me, I\u2019m just a\nhigh school student!\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tony takes a seat next to you. \u201cDoes Peter\nknow? Does your Dad even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d you shout, without thinking. Wincing at how you just\ngave yourself a way, you bury your face in your hands. \u201cNeither of them can\nknow anything. They\u2019d be so worried, you don\u2019t even understand. Everyone <i>know</i>s you\u2019re Iron-Man. People at school would\nfreak out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that, you don\u2019t have to tell them,\u201d he nods, looking\nas though he wants to say something else. \u201cDo you know Spider-Man, by any\nchance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of him and I\u2019ve seen him around,\u201d you furrow your\nbrows at the odd question. \u201cBut I work alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow <i>do</i> you work?\u201d\nTony asks, crossing his arms and looking curious. \u201cLike, what makes people just\nlisten to you and stop being criminals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you simply shrug, being truthful. \u201cOne day,\nI went out late at night to sit in the park and draw. Then I saw some weird,\nglowing piece of debris fell out of the sky and went to see. As soon as I\ntouched it, I blacked out and woke up in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Tony wrinkles his nose, dismissive. \u201cNot the weirdest\nthing I\u2019ve ever heard. So, what? You stare into people\u2019s eyes and they just do\nwhat you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and all my senses are heightened. It\u2019s\u2026 really weird,\nbut all I do is help little thefts and things around the neighbourhood. Nothing\nlike Spider-Man and you with the Avengers,\u201d you clarify hastily. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking of that, how would you feel about joining the\nAvengers?\u201d</p><p>You blink. </p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d you mumble, not believing your ears. \u201cYou want\nme to join the <i>Avengers</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d he states, looking expectant. \u201cI won\u2019t ask\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you exhale, heart racing. \u201cYes, of course, a thousand\ntimes yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a lot easier than he was,\u201d Tony mutters, raising\nan eyebrow. You decide not to question who he\u2019s talking about, still a little\nshaken. \u201cWhere\u2019s your suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-my suit? I just wear a black hoodie and leggings most of\nthe time\u2026\u201d you trail off when you spot the horrified look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou go around fighting criminals in <i>a hoodie and leggings</i>? You do realise you could get hurt in this\njob,\u201d his demeanour becomes serious and almost parental as though he\u2019s scolding\nyou. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to send a suit then, be prepared to get one in the\nmail.\u201d</p><p>Before you have any chance to speak or even thank him for\nmaking you a suit, Tony stands up and walks towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll send you\ndetails via an actual email this time and we\u2019ll see if you\u2019re fit to be an\nAvenger, kid.\u201d</p><p>Stomach churning- from excitement or nerves, you don\u2019t know-\nyou quickly stop him before he turns the handle. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell my Dad, will\nyou?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he assures you, but then adds as an\nafterthought, \u201cunless you get seriously hurt. You gotta remember that I\u2019m\nresponsible for your life now and I can\u2019t take any risks with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair, but\u2026 you won\u2019t tell Peter either, right? I\nmean, he probably sees you guys whenever he goes there for the internship. I\ncan\u2019t let him know either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony nods his head, awkwardly tapping his hands\nagainst the handle of your door. \u201cThe internship. Your secret is safe with me,\u201d\nhe mimes zipping his mouth and throwing away the key which causes you to let\nout a sigh of relief. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr Stark,\u201d you offer him a smile as you open your door.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s go and lie our asses off to my Dad.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prviqpgPMi1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"></figure><p>For someone who jumps off of buildings and faces numerous\ncriminals who hold guns to your face, you really shouldn\u2019t be this nervous. </p><p><i>They\u2019re just the\nAvengers</i>, you tell yourself. How intimidating can they possibly be?</p><p>Using the pass that Tony gave you, along with the protective\nsuit he made, you make your way into the building known as the Avengers Tower. </p><p>As you pass into the elevator, you catch sight of your\nreflection. The new outfit feels foreign, but at the same time it feels like <i>you</i>. The all black theme of the\nfigure-hugging suit makes you feel light and weightless- not as restrictive as your\nhoodie, but it\u2019s paired with a thin hood that veils your hair, staying in place\nand a mask that covers the lower part of your face. </p><p>For dramatic purposes only, you decided to outline your eyes\nin a deep, black liner as soon as you got home from school, which is a huge\ncontrast to your usually makeup free face. Admiring how different you look from\nyour usual self, you almost don\u2019t notice the elevator stop and the agent waiting\noutside. </p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Agent Hill,\u201d the woman extends her hand to you with\na polite smile as you step outside the elevator. \u201cTony has told me all about\nyou, and the team are highly anticipating your arrival.\u201d</p><p>She starts a brisk pace and you quickly run to catch up,\nstomach fluttering from anxiety. \u201cA-all of them?\u201d you say, but curse inwardly\nas soon as you realise you sound like a little kid. So much for showing you can\nbe mature. </p><p>\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t worry,\u201d she laughs, waving it off. \u201cYou\naren\u2019t the only teenager, remember?\u201d</p><p>Furrowing your brows, your silence causes Agent Hill to\nglance at you when you turn a corner. \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d she says as though the one\nname is an explanation. A shake of your head leads her to elaborate. \u201cHe\u2019s the\nsame age as you, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d you laugh, nervously. You\u2019re glad your face is\nmostly covered by your mask so that Hill can\u2019t see your shock written plain as\nday all over your face. \u201cI do know that Peter Parker is around here a lot\nbecause of the Stark Internship, do you know him by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014You don\u2019t\u2026 Uhm. Yeah,\u201d she stumbles over her words,\nclearing her throat quickly. \u201cYes, I do know him.\u201d</p><p>Her short and confusing response does nothing to calm you\nabout the possibility that your identity may accidentally be revealed to your\nunknowing best friend. \u201cJust a small favour\u2026 If Peter is ever here, he can\u2019t\nknow my real name.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep, understood,\u201d her answer comes clipped and she starts\nwalking faster. You soon reach a large door, which Agent Hill stops in front of.\n\u201cHere we are. Ready?\u201d</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, you nod, bracing yourself for this\nmeeting. Agent Hill opens the door after muttering a couple words into her\nearpiece that you don\u2019t quite catch.</p><p>As soon as the Avengers come into sight, you have to physically\nforce yourself not to let out a scream. </p><p>\u201cHey, Supernova,\u201d Tony smiles proudly when he sees the powerful\neffect his suit seems to have in making you look like an actual superhero.\n\u201cMeet the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d you mutter, barely audible as you wave an awkward hand\nin lieu of greeting. \u201cI-I\u2019m Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve Rogers,\u201d says Captain America, stepping forward to\nshake your hand. </p><p><i>Holy crap, you just\nshook hands with Captain America. </i>\u201cOh, I know all of your names already,\u201d you\nclarify, bringing forth laughter from them all. </p><p>Sweeping a quick gaze across the room, you notice that apart\nfrom the original six Avengers, there\u2019s Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Scarlet Witch and\nVision. Most of them being preoccupied with their own business, you inch a\nlittle closer to Tony who\u2019s the only person you know well.</p><p>Before you can think about who\u2019s missing, Natasha cuts in.\n\u201cTony, isn\u2019t she a little young? You want her to come on the latest mission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d you quickly defend, not wanting\nto be labelled as a little kid on your first day of being here. </p><p>\u201cWe have no doubts about that,\u201d Steve adds kindly. \u201cBut you\nhave family and friends and school to think about too. You aren\u2019t as expendable\nas some of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually the same age as\u2014\u201d Tony starts off but is\ninterrupted by someone running into the room. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>You notice that the person rushing down with his backpack on\nhis bag is none other than the red and blue clad figure of Spider-Man. </p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, I just got off school and had to stop some\ncreep in an alleyway from annoying this woman, so I got a little held up and\u2014 woah,\nwho\u2019s this?\u201d he comes at a stop in front of you. </p><p>His voice is so familiar that you don\u2019t answer. Instead, you\nstare, dumbfounded at who\u2019s voice you think you\u2019re hearing. No\u2026 It can\u2019t be. </p><p>Vaguely in the background you hear someone introduce you as\nSupernova, to which he responds with, \u201cOh, cool, they told me you\u2019d be coming!\nI\u2019m Spider-Man, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Taking off his mask, you find yourself face to face with\nnone other than your best friend himself.</p><p>\u201cP-peter?\u201d you exhale, finding yourself paralysed. </p><p>He raises a brow, perplexed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my name. Why do\nyou sound so shocked?\u201d he asks, chuckling.</p><p>Hands trembling, you lift your hands to your mask,\nhesitating for a second before removing it. </p><p>He stares for a second, smile fading.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he whispers, his mask falling out of his grasp and\nonto the floor. \u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> Supernova? Wha\u2014\nwhy the fuck didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he exclaims, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Why didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019re Spider-Man?\u201d you fire\nback, equally as irked. </p><p>\u201cI asked first!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2014?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you two know each other?\u201d Sam cuts you off, looking\namused. </p><p>Glaring daggers into Peter once more before looking to Sam,\nyou cross your arms. \u201cYes, he\u2019s my supposed best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s gotta be awkward,\u201d Clint shakes his head in\nsympathy of your situation and the others hum in agreement. </p><p>\u201c<i>Supposed</i>?\u201d Peter\nscoffs and you stare him straight in the eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that you\u2019ve been lying to your best friend about\nthe Stark Internship! Speaking of that,\u201d you look at Tony to see he\u2019s\npretending to be preoccupied with some gadget. \u201cMr Stark, would you like to\nexplain yourself now? Why didn\u2019t you tell me you knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, Tony knew?\u201d Bruce pipes up, momentarily looking over\nfrom his table and raising his eyebrows, at the man in question. \u201cThis is on\nyou, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey!\u201d he raises his hands in surrender, wincing when\nhe sees you and Peter looking expectantly for an answer. \u201cIn my defence, I knew\nyou\u2019d find out eventually and you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t exactly doing me a favour,\u201d you scowl, blood\nboiling at the fact that he kept such a huge secret from you. Well, so did you,\nbut that\u2019s not the point.</p><p>Whipping around to look at you, Peter looks furious, but\nafter knowing him for so long you can tell that he\u2019s also little hurt. \u201cWe\naren\u2019t going to talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a little pissed if you hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d you reply,\ncurtly and he laughs without a trace of humour at this.</p><p>\u201cOh, you think I\u2019m happy that one of the people most\nimportant to me is risking her life every day and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Peter asks\nthis with a disbelieving tone and your heart aches with a pang. </p><p>Okay, <i>now</i> you feel\nguilty. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realise you\u2019re also important to me? And you\u2019re\nconstantly in greater danger, so how am I meant to live with that?\u201d</p><p>Natasha lowers her voice and mumbles something to Steve, but\nyou manage to make it out anyway. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re arguing or making\nup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d he sighs, walking closer to you. \u201cAnd unless\nyou guys sort something out, neither of you are coming on this mission. I\u2019m\npairing you together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Peter says with a serious expression at the same\ntime that you exclaim otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you throw your hands up in frustration. \u201cDo you know\nwhat that\u2019s gonna be like? He literally acts like my mother half the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not just say that, Y/N, <i>tell</i> me you did not just say that,\u201d Peter groans, covering his face\nwith one hand in exasperation. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t so annoyingly protective when I\u2019m\nperfectly capable of looking out for myself\u2026\u201d you trail off, shooting him a\nlook. </p><p>Steve rolls his eyes at your back and forth argument and\nTony just lets out a low whistle. When you catch Natasha\u2019s eye, she has a little\nsmirk playing on her face. She raises her eyebrows. Before you can inquire,\nBruce walks over from his table of maps and papers along with the rest of the\nteam. </p><p>\u201cAlright, we have a plan and we just have to debrief you all\non it now. The general idea is that we go in and disable the HYDRA weapon\nwhilst also taking out any agents on the outside. I don\u2019t know if we can even\ncall them HYDRA, they\u2019re just a bunch of psychos trying to keep the\norganisation going, but they\u2019re dangerous nonetheless. Y/N, listen closely\nsince this is your first time,\u201d Bruce informs you and the excitement makes you\nhold in a smile. </p><p>\n \n \n\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvirm7XAc1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"></figure><p>\u201cI TOLD YOU TO GO LEFT!\u201d Peter screams through the earpiece\nwhen you land with a thump on your side next to a tree. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go <i>left</i>\nwhen there\u2019s someone with a gun trying to shoot at me <i>from the same side</i>,\u201d you groan, lifting yourself up from the ground\nand immediately whipping around to stop a blow from an agent, locking his arm\nin your hold and staring him in the eyes. Straight away his own pupils begin to\nglow and his hold relaxes, posture straightening and you can now tell him what\nto do. </p><p>\u201cBe a sweetheart and take down some of your own men, will\nyou?\u201d you smile and he nods in a trance, walking away with his gun. </p><p>\u201cGood job, Y/N,\u201d Steve says from inside the building,\npanting from exertion. \u201cWe\u2019re almost done so try and stay low now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Cap,\u201d you respond, just as Peter lands next to\nyou from goodness knows where. </p><p>Taking off his mask, Peter stares at you in amazement. \u201cThat\nwas awesome! All you have to do is look at them? Do they even remember\nafterwards? Wait, have you ever tried to do that to me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, no and no,\u201d you list off the answers to his question,\nbut then add with a teasing tone, \u201cbut who\u2019s to say I won\u2019t do it in the future?\nWatch out, Parker,\u201d you whisper the last bit and Peter\u2019s eyes widen as he stays\nsilent. </p><p>Suddenly a voice sounds through the earpiece and makes you\ncrack a smile. \u201cY/N, you\u2019re scaring the kid,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice sounds vaguely\npreoccupied and you hear a few grunts and shots going off in the background. </p><p>\u201cMr Stark, do you need help?\u201d Peter asks, worry lacing his\nvoice and the two of you straighten up, ready to go and help. </p><p>\u201cNope, just finishing up.\u201d A loud clang of metal resounds\nmaking you and Peter wince. \u201cGetting ready to leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, web-slinger, can you grab Y/N and bring her to the\nship?\u201d Natasha yells over the sound of whirring machinery which makes you\nassume she\u2019s already on board. </p><p>Putting his mask back on, Peter wraps a hand around your waist\ntightly and you cling on for dear life. Where his hands are placed, you feel heat\nsearing through the material of your suit and it makes your cheeks warm up.\nConsidering this isn\u2019t the first time, you push the feeling down and swallow\nharshly. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asks, hand extended upwards. </p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d And then he shoots, lifting you off the ground to\nweb his way to the ship. You keep your eyes shut the entire way, wind blowing\naround your hood. Within seconds you find yourself standing inside the ship as\nthe exit closes slowly. </p><p>You lean on Peter for support as you get your bearings\nstraight, swaying from slight dizziness. \u201cOkay I never want to do that again.\u201d</p><p>He just chuckles in response and the two of you walk into\nthe main room where the others are gathered, most of them seated from the\nexhaustion of the mission. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are getting old,\u201d Peter snickers into his fist as\nyou and him seem to be the only ones who aren\u2019t showing effects of running\naround in combat. \u201cAlso, web-slinger? Really?\u201d he directs this at Natasha with\nraised eyebrows and an unimpressed air while she just smirks, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid,\u201d Tony nods at you, seeming to be\nsatisfied with your work and pride blooms in your chest at his praise. You get\nthe feeling he doesn\u2019t offer it much. \u201cWelcome to the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean she gets to stay over whenever she wants?\u201d\nPeter asks hopefully, but the question makes you fold your arms and furrow your\nbrows.</p><p>\u201cHang on, is this why you\u2019re never home anymore? You stay\nhere all the time?\u201d you scoff, shaking your head in irritation. The amount of\ntimes you decided to pay him a visit when you had a spare moment just to find\nout he wasn\u2019t home is ridiculous, you think to yourself. </p><p>\u201cNot all the time!\u201d he\u2019s quick to defend himself, raising\nhis hands as though you\u2019re pointing a gun at him. \u201cI can\u2019t just leave May by\nherself all the time, I\u2019m only here some weekends! Plus, she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Aunt May before me?\u201d you narrow your eyes\nsuspiciously and you can feel everyone\u2019s eyes moving from you to Peter, back\nand forth as you talk. \u201cWho else knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe found out by accident and so did Ned!\u201d he rushes to\nexplain, but upon realising what he just said, he stops and looks like a deer\ncaught in the headlights.</p><p>Taken aback, you inhale once deeply. \u201c<i>Ned knows</i>? And you didn\u2019t tell <i>me</i>?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHave I fucked up?\u201d Peter whispers frightfully to no one in\nparticular as you glare at him with all the anger you can muster. </p><p>Before you can say that yes, he has fucked up, Natasha\ninterrupts. \u201cCareful, Steve doesn\u2019t like that kind of language, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNat, I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n \n \n\u201c<i>Language</i>.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvirtMIQG1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"></figure><p>Sweat drips down your forehead as you continuously fire\npunches in Peter\u2019s direction, only to be met with air as he dodges them,\nturning up behind you to sweep you off your feet. Literally. </p><p>You grunt, twisting around to lie on your back for what\nfeels like the hundredth time. This isn\u2019t your first training session after you\njoined the Avengers and you definitely underestimated how hard it would be.\nFrom missions to sparring with Nat to surprise scenarios to test you it was physically\ndraining, but you had to admit that you were starting to feel at home in the\nfamily like environment. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if this was a real fight, I\u2019d just look at you\nand make you walk away,\u201d you complain, taking his hand when he offers it to\nlift you off the ground. </p><p>He shrugs at this, giving you an apologetic smile. \u201cCap says\nyou have to be prepared to fight without your powers, so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d you roll your shoulders and stand in a\nfighting stance. You gotta say you\u2019re getting tired of this. \u201cCap can\u2019t control\npeople with his eyes now, can he?\u201d</p><p>Then, you lunge. </p><p>Peter catches your first fist in one hand, but stumbles when\nyou kick into his side before grabbing hold of your leg and pulling you\nforward. </p><p>\u201cWoah,\u201d you gasp, falling into his chest with a force that\nknocks your breath away. That, combined with the fact his face is only inches\nfrom yours. </p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d he whispers, lightly chuckling. With your leg\nwrapped around him and his hand on your thigh you can\u2019t seem to think straight\nand you stutter, at a loss for words. When his eyes flicker down to your lips\nfor a split second, your mind goes into overdrive and a bubble of nervous\nlaughter escapes you. </p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d you whisper, eyes wide and stomach fluttering.\n\u201cIf this was in the middle of a fight, we\u2019d be dead by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing we\u2019re alone then, huh?\u201d Peter exhales and when\nhis nose brushes against yours, you realise how little the space between you\nhas become and how his lips are too far from yours for your liking. </p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s good because\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it means I can kiss you,\u201d he says and then\nimmediately closes the distance that was separating you by pressing his lips\nagainst yours. </p><p>As his hand travels up your thigh to rest on your hip, the\nother cupping the side of your face as he kisses you, you fight back a shiver.\nTrailing a hand up his abdomen, you grip his shoulder as he deepens the kiss\nand you melt into his hold, humming contentedly.</p><p>You feel him smiling into the kiss before he breaks away to\nrest his forehead against your own. </p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t out of line, was it?\u201d Peter asks a little\nbreathlessly, looking up at you through his eyelashes. \u201cI mean, you didn\u2019t push\nme away, so that\u2019s gotta count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I kissed you back, dumbass,\u201d you respond, playfully rolling\nyour eyes as you nudge his shoulder with your hand that rests there. \u201cIt kind\nof means that I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you do?\u201d he repeats with wide eyes as if he\u2019s a little\nunsure. You can also tell that underlying his expression of uncertainty is a\nsmile that\u2019s waiting to break through. </p><p>Grinning widely at this, you take his hand in your own and\nintertwine your fingers. \u201cYeah, I would have thought it was pretty obvious by\nnow, but clearly you\u2019re just as clueless! But\u2026this isn\u2019t going to be weird now,\nis it? We haven\u2019t ruined our friendship now, have we?\u201d your smile fades a little\nas you add this on, suddenly considering the situation.

You wince when\nyour bruised hip brushes against your desk as you walk towards the door and\nimmediately put on an impassive face to hide the fact that your entire body is\naching.</p><p>Walking out the door,\nyou smile at your dad and notice the person sitting next to him on the couch.\nWhen he turns around to wave at you, your jaw drops.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re\nTony Stark. The real Tony Stark, holy cow,\u201d you blurt out, eyes wide. \u201cDad,\nthat\u2019s Tony Stark sitting next to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am Tony Stark,\u201d he says through a grin as\nthough it\u2019s obvious. Well, now that you think about it, it\u00a0<i>is</i>\u00a0obvious and you\u2019ve just made a fool of yourself\nin front of Tony <i>freaking</i> Stark. \u201cI\u2019m\nhere about the internship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternship?\u201d you\nmumble, confused. \u201cLike the actual Stark internship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, isn\u2019t Peter\ndoing that?\u201d your dad pipes in.</p><p>\u201cUh, Peter\u00a0<i>Parker</i>? A little\nawkward, talks a lot, loves making pop culture references?\u201d asks Tony, shifting\nuncomfortably. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my best\nfriend,\u201d you nod, a pit of guilt forming in your stomach at the mention of\nPeter. You\u2019ve been neglecting him for weeks because you\u2019re always too bruised\nup or tired to hang out recently. He probably feels the distance considering he\nhasn\u2019t been asking to meet up either, you note. \u201cYou want me to do that\ninternship?\u201d you ask dubiously. You haven\u2019t even signed up for it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been emailing each other about it, remember? I decided to\ntake you up on it,\u201d Tony smiles, glancing at your Dad quickly to see that he\u2019s\nlooking at you, perplexed. And then Tony winks at you frantically. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you start off slowly, eyes narrowed. \u201cThe\u2026 the emails,\nyeah. I applied for the internship as well. I, uh, didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get it so I\ndidn\u2019t bother telling you, Dad. S-surprise?\u201d you try for a casual chuckle.</p><p>To your shock, he just shrugs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy for you, it sounds\ngood!\u201d your dad nods encouragingly. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, would it be okay to speak to Y/N alone?\u201d Tony\npolitely asks, standing up from the couch.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll just be in the kitchen,\u201d your Dad responds, shaking\nTony Stark\u2019s hand before making his way out. </p><p>Looking at Tony suspiciously, you say, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in my room if you\nneed us.\u201d </p><p>Gesturing for him to follow you, the two of you walk towards your\ndoor and you swallow nervously about why he\u2019s here. It\u2019s a good thing you\nremembered to put concealer on your face today.</p><p>As you take a seat nervously on the edge of your bed, Tony shuts\nthe door behind him. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve probably guessed there\u2019s no internship for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Really?\u201d you feign ignorance. \u201cThat\u2019s surprising\nconsidering the fact that I <i>never applied</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that,\u201d he sighs, forming a temple with his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m\njust going to get straight to it. I know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of assumed that when you said my name,\u201d you roll\nyour eyes to fake nonchalance when in actuality, your heart is pounding against\nyour chest. He can\u2019t mean what you think he means.</p><p>\u201cFunny. You\u2019re a funny one, you remind me of Peter,\u201d he\nsays, but you guess that he\u2019s being sarcastic. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d you keep an impassive face, causing Tony to\nsnort. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>A knowing smirk on his face, Tony pulls out his phone and\ntypes for a few seconds. Then, with a flick of his finger, he pulls up a\nrecording of New York city at night. </p><p>Your palms become clammy when a lithe and slender figure\ncomes into view, standing on the edge of a building. Dressed in all black, the\nfigure jumps from the building and lands perfectly before an electronics store\nand walking in. You watch with bated breath as the video cuts to when a glowing\nlight fills up the store and a couple of thieves walk out, empty handed. </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s the, uh, Supernova girl,\u201d you swallow, squinting\nat the video. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so how\u2019d you do that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d you splutter, eyes wide. \u201cThat\u2019s not me, I\u2019m just a\nhigh school student!\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tony takes a seat next to you. \u201cDoes Peter\nknow? Does your Dad even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d you shout, without thinking. Wincing at how you just\ngave yourself a way, you bury your face in your hands. \u201cNeither of them can\nknow anything. They\u2019d be so worried, you don\u2019t even understand. Everyone <i>know</i>s you\u2019re Iron-Man. People at school would\nfreak out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that, you don\u2019t have to tell them,\u201d he nods, looking\nas though he wants to say something else. \u201cDo you know Spider-Man, by any\nchance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of him and I\u2019ve seen him around,\u201d you furrow your\nbrows at the odd question. \u201cBut I work alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow <i>do</i> you work?\u201d\nTony asks, crossing his arms and looking curious. \u201cLike, what makes people just\nlisten to you and stop being criminals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you simply shrug, being truthful. \u201cOne day,\nI went out late at night to sit in the park and draw. Then I saw some weird,\nglowing piece of debris fell out of the sky and went to see. As soon as I\ntouched it, I blacked out and woke up in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Tony wrinkles his nose, dismissive. \u201cNot the weirdest\nthing I\u2019ve ever heard. So, what? You stare into people\u2019s eyes and they just do\nwhat you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and all my senses are heightened. It\u2019s\u2026 really weird,\nbut all I do is help little thefts and things around the neighbourhood. Nothing\nlike Spider-Man and you with the Avengers,\u201d you clarify hastily. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking of that, how would you feel about joining the\nAvengers?\u201d</p><p>You blink. </p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d you mumble, not believing your ears. \u201cYou want\nme to join the <i>Avengers</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d he states, looking expectant. \u201cI won\u2019t ask\nagain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you exhale, heart racing. \u201cYes, of course, a thousand\ntimes yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a lot easier than he was,\u201d Tony mutters, raising\nan eyebrow. You decide not to question who he\u2019s talking about, still a little\nshaken. \u201cWhere\u2019s your suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-my suit? I just wear a black hoodie and leggings most of\nthe time\u2026\u201d you trail off when you spot the horrified look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou go around fighting criminals in <i>a hoodie and leggings</i>? You do realise you could get hurt in this\njob,\u201d his demeanour becomes serious and almost parental as though he\u2019s scolding\nyou. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to send a suit then, be prepared to get one in the\nmail.\u201d</p><p>Before you have any chance to speak or even thank him for\nmaking you a suit, Tony stands up and walks towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll send you\ndetails via an actual email this time and we\u2019ll see if you\u2019re fit to be an\nAvenger, kid.\u201d</p><p>Stomach churning- from excitement or nerves, you don\u2019t know-\nyou quickly stop him before he turns the handle. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell my Dad, will\nyou?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he assures you, but then adds as an\nafterthought, \u201cunless you get seriously hurt. You gotta remember that I\u2019m\nresponsible for your life now and I can\u2019t take any risks with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair, but\u2026 you won\u2019t tell Peter either, right? I\nmean, he probably sees you guys whenever he goes there for the internship. I\ncan\u2019t let him know either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony nods his head, awkwardly tapping his hands\nagainst the handle of your door. \u201cThe internship. Your secret is safe with me,\u201d\nhe mimes zipping his mouth and throwing away the key which causes you to let\nout a sigh of relief. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr Stark,\u201d you offer him a smile as you open your door.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s go and lie our asses off to my Dad.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prviqpgPMi1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"></figure><p>For someone who jumps off of buildings and faces numerous\ncriminals who hold guns to your face, you really shouldn\u2019t be this nervous. </p><p><i>They\u2019re just the\nAvengers</i>, you tell yourself. How intimidating can they possibly be?</p><p>Using the pass that Tony gave you, along with the protective\nsuit he made, you make your way into the building known as the Avengers Tower. </p><p>As you pass into the elevator, you catch sight of your\nreflection. The new outfit feels foreign, but at the same time it feels like <i>you</i>. The all black theme of the\nfigure-hugging suit makes you feel light and weightless- not as restrictive as your\nhoodie, but it\u2019s paired with a thin hood that veils your hair, staying in place\nand a mask that covers the lower part of your face. </p><p>For dramatic purposes only, you decided to outline your eyes\nin a deep, black liner as soon as you got home from school, which is a huge\ncontrast to your usually makeup free face. Admiring how different you look from\nyour usual self, you almost don\u2019t notice the elevator stop and the agent waiting\noutside. </p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Agent Hill,\u201d the woman extends her hand to you with\na polite smile as you step outside the elevator. \u201cTony has told me all about\nyou, and the team are highly anticipating your arrival.\u201d</p><p>She starts a brisk pace and you quickly run to catch up,\nstomach fluttering from anxiety. \u201cA-all of them?\u201d you say, but curse inwardly\nas soon as you realise you sound like a little kid. So much for showing you can\nbe mature. </p><p>\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t worry,\u201d she laughs, waving it off. \u201cYou\naren\u2019t the only teenager, remember?\u201d</p><p>Furrowing your brows, your silence causes Agent Hill to\nglance at you when you turn a corner. \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d she says as though the one\nname is an explanation. A shake of your head leads her to elaborate. \u201cHe\u2019s the\nsame age as you, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d you laugh, nervously. You\u2019re glad your face is\nmostly covered by your mask so that Hill can\u2019t see your shock written plain as\nday all over your face. \u201cI do know that Peter Parker is around here a lot\nbecause of the Stark Internship, do you know him by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014You don\u2019t\u2026 Uhm. Yeah,\u201d she stumbles over her words,\nclearing her throat quickly. \u201cYes, I do know him.\u201d</p><p>Her short and confusing response does nothing to calm you\nabout the possibility that your identity may accidentally be revealed to your\nunknowing best friend. \u201cJust a small favour\u2026 If Peter is ever here, he can\u2019t\nknow my real name.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep, understood,\u201d her answer comes clipped and she starts\nwalking faster. You soon reach a large door, which Agent Hill stops in front of.\n\u201cHere we are. Ready?\u201d</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, you nod, bracing yourself for this\nmeeting. Agent Hill opens the door after muttering a couple words into her\nearpiece that you don\u2019t quite catch.</p><p>As soon as the Avengers come into sight, you have to physically\nforce yourself not to let out a scream. </p><p>\u201cHey, Supernova,\u201d Tony smiles proudly when he sees the powerful\neffect his suit seems to have in making you look like an actual superhero.\n\u201cMeet the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d you mutter, barely audible as you wave an awkward hand\nin lieu of greeting. \u201cI-I\u2019m Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve Rogers,\u201d says Captain America, stepping forward to\nshake your hand. </p><p><i>Holy crap, you just\nshook hands with Captain America. </i>\u201cOh, I know all of your names already,\u201d you\nclarify, bringing forth laughter from them all. </p><p>Sweeping a quick gaze across the room, you notice that apart\nfrom the original six Avengers, there\u2019s Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Scarlet Witch and\nVision. Most of them being preoccupied with their own business, you inch a\nlittle closer to Tony who\u2019s the only person you know well.</p><p>Before you can think about who\u2019s missing, Natasha cuts in.\n\u201cTony, isn\u2019t she a little young? You want her to come on the latest mission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d you quickly defend, not wanting\nto be labelled as a little kid on your first day of being here. </p><p>\u201cWe have no doubts about that,\u201d Steve adds kindly. \u201cBut you\nhave family and friends and school to think about too. You aren\u2019t as expendable\nas some of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually the same age as\u2014\u201d Tony starts off but is\ninterrupted by someone running into the room. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>You notice that the person rushing down with his backpack on\nhis bag is none other than the red and blue clad figure of Spider-Man. </p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, I just got off school and had to stop some\ncreep in an alleyway from annoying this woman, so I got a little held up and\u2014 woah,\nwho\u2019s this?\u201d he comes at a stop in front of you. </p><p>His voice is so familiar that you don\u2019t answer. Instead, you\nstare, dumbfounded at who\u2019s voice you think you\u2019re hearing. No\u2026 It can\u2019t be. </p><p>Vaguely in the background you hear someone introduce you as\nSupernova, to which he responds with, \u201cOh, cool, they told me you\u2019d be coming!\nI\u2019m Spider-Man, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Taking off his mask, you find yourself face to face with\nnone other than your best friend himself.</p><p>\u201cP-peter?\u201d you exhale, finding yourself paralysed. </p><p>He raises a brow, perplexed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my name. Why do\nyou sound so shocked?\u201d he asks, chuckling.</p><p>Hands trembling, you lift your hands to your mask,\nhesitating for a second before removing it. </p><p>He stares for a second, smile fading.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he whispers, his mask falling out of his grasp and\nonto the floor. \u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> Supernova? Wha\u2014\nwhy the fuck didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he exclaims, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Why didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019re Spider-Man?\u201d you fire\nback, equally as irked. </p><p>\u201cI asked first!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2014?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you two know each other?\u201d Sam cuts you off, looking\namused. </p><p>Glaring daggers into Peter once more before looking to Sam,\nyou cross your arms. \u201cYes, he\u2019s my supposed best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s gotta be awkward,\u201d Clint shakes his head in\nsympathy of your situation and the others hum in agreement. </p><p>\u201c<i>Supposed</i>?\u201d Peter\nscoffs and you stare him straight in the eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that you\u2019ve been lying to your best friend about\nthe Stark Internship! Speaking of that,\u201d you look at Tony to see he\u2019s\npretending to be preoccupied with some gadget. \u201cMr Stark, would you like to\nexplain yourself now? Why didn\u2019t you tell me you knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, Tony knew?\u201d Bruce pipes up, momentarily looking over\nfrom his table and raising his eyebrows, at the man in question. \u201cThis is on\nyou, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey!\u201d he raises his hands in surrender, wincing when\nhe sees you and Peter looking expectantly for an answer. \u201cIn my defence, I knew\nyou\u2019d find out eventually and you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t exactly doing me a favour,\u201d you scowl, blood\nboiling at the fact that he kept such a huge secret from you. Well, so did you,\nbut that\u2019s not the point.</p><p>Whipping around to look at you, Peter looks furious, but\nafter knowing him for so long you can tell that he\u2019s also little hurt. \u201cWe\naren\u2019t going to talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a little pissed if you hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d you reply,\ncurtly and he laughs without a trace of humour at this.</p><p>\u201cOh, you think I\u2019m happy that one of the people most\nimportant to me is risking her life every day and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Peter asks\nthis with a disbelieving tone and your heart aches with a pang. </p><p>Okay, <i>now</i> you feel\nguilty. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realise you\u2019re also important to me? And you\u2019re\nconstantly in greater danger, so how am I meant to live with that?\u201d</p><p>Natasha lowers her voice and mumbles something to Steve, but\nyou manage to make it out anyway. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re arguing or making\nup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d he sighs, walking closer to you. \u201cAnd unless\nyou guys sort something out, neither of you are coming on this mission. I\u2019m\npairing you together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Peter says with a serious expression at the same\ntime that you exclaim otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you throw your hands up in frustration. \u201cDo you know\nwhat that\u2019s gonna be like? He literally acts like my mother half the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not just say that, Y/N, <i>tell</i> me you did not just say that,\u201d Peter groans, covering his face\nwith one hand in exasperation. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t so annoyingly protective when I\u2019m\nperfectly capable of looking out for myself\u2026\u201d you trail off, shooting him a\nlook. </p><p>Steve rolls his eyes at your back and forth argument and\nTony just lets out a low whistle. When you catch Natasha\u2019s eye, she has a little\nsmirk playing on her face. She raises her eyebrows. Before you can inquire,\nBruce walks over from his table of maps and papers along with the rest of the\nteam. </p><p>\u201cAlright, we have a plan and we just have to debrief you all\non it now. The general idea is that we go in and disable the HYDRA weapon\nwhilst also taking out any agents on the outside. I don\u2019t know if we can even\ncall them HYDRA, they\u2019re just a bunch of psychos trying to keep the\norganisation going, but they\u2019re dangerous nonetheless. Y/N, listen closely\nsince this is your first time,\u201d Bruce informs you and the excitement makes you\nhold in a smile. </p><p>\n \n \n\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvirm7XAc1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"></figure><p>\u201cI TOLD YOU TO GO LEFT!\u201d Peter screams through the earpiece\nwhen you land with a thump on your side next to a tree. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go <i>left</i>\nwhen there\u2019s someone with a gun trying to shoot at me <i>from the same side</i>,\u201d you groan, lifting yourself up from the ground\nand immediately whipping around to stop a blow from an agent, locking his arm\nin your hold and staring him in the eyes. Straight away his own pupils begin to\nglow and his hold relaxes, posture straightening and you can now tell him what\nto do. </p><p>\u201cBe a sweetheart and take down some of your own men, will\nyou?\u201d you smile and he nods in a trance, walking away with his gun. </p><p>\u201cGood job, Y/N,\u201d Steve says from inside the building,\npanting from exertion. \u201cWe\u2019re almost done so try and stay low now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Cap,\u201d you respond, just as Peter lands next to\nyou from goodness knows where. </p><p>Taking off his mask, Peter stares at you in amazement. \u201cThat\nwas awesome! All you have to do is look at them? Do they even remember\nafterwards? Wait, have you ever tried to do that to me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, no and no,\u201d you list off the answers to his question,\nbut then add with a teasing tone, \u201cbut who\u2019s to say I won\u2019t do it in the future?\nWatch out, Parker,\u201d you whisper the last bit and Peter\u2019s eyes widen as he stays\nsilent. </p><p>Suddenly a voice sounds through the earpiece and makes you\ncrack a smile. \u201cY/N, you\u2019re scaring the kid,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice sounds vaguely\npreoccupied and you hear a few grunts and shots going off in the background. </p><p>\u201cMr Stark, do you need help?\u201d Peter asks, worry lacing his\nvoice and the two of you straighten up, ready to go and help. </p><p>\u201cNope, just finishing up.\u201d A loud clang of metal resounds\nmaking you and Peter wince. \u201cGetting ready to leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, web-slinger, can you grab Y/N and bring her to the\nship?\u201d Natasha yells over the sound of whirring machinery which makes you\nassume she\u2019s already on board. </p><p>Putting his mask back on, Peter wraps a hand around your waist\ntightly and you cling on for dear life. Where his hands are placed, you feel heat\nsearing through the material of your suit and it makes your cheeks warm up.\nConsidering this isn\u2019t the first time, you push the feeling down and swallow\nharshly. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asks, hand extended upwards. </p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d And then he shoots, lifting you off the ground to\nweb his way to the ship. You keep your eyes shut the entire way, wind blowing\naround your hood. Within seconds you find yourself standing inside the ship as\nthe exit closes slowly. </p><p>You lean on Peter for support as you get your bearings\nstraight, swaying from slight dizziness. \u201cOkay I never want to do that again.\u201d</p><p>He just chuckles in response and the two of you walk into\nthe main room where the others are gathered, most of them seated from the\nexhaustion of the mission. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are getting old,\u201d Peter snickers into his fist as\nyou and him seem to be the only ones who aren\u2019t showing effects of running\naround in combat. \u201cAlso, web-slinger? Really?\u201d he directs this at Natasha with\nraised eyebrows and an unimpressed air while she just smirks, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid,\u201d Tony nods at you, seeming to be\nsatisfied with your work and pride blooms in your chest at his praise. You get\nthe feeling he doesn\u2019t offer it much. \u201cWelcome to the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean she gets to stay over whenever she wants?\u201d\nPeter asks hopefully, but the question makes you fold your arms and furrow your\nbrows.</p><p>\u201cHang on, is this why you\u2019re never home anymore? You stay\nhere all the time?\u201d you scoff, shaking your head in irritation. The amount of\ntimes you decided to pay him a visit when you had a spare moment just to find\nout he wasn\u2019t home is ridiculous, you think to yourself. </p><p>\u201cNot all the time!\u201d he\u2019s quick to defend himself, raising\nhis hands as though you\u2019re pointing a gun at him. \u201cI can\u2019t just leave May by\nherself all the time, I\u2019m only here some weekends!

And you didn\u2019t tell <i>me</i>?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHave I fucked up?\u201d Peter whispers frightfully to no one in\nparticular as you glare at him with all the anger you can muster. </p><p>Before you can say that yes, he has fucked up, Natasha\ninterrupts. \u201cCareful, Steve doesn\u2019t like that kind of language, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNat, I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n \n \n\u201c<i>Language</i>.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvirtMIQG1v49vpe_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"601\" data-orig-height=\"5\"></figure><p>Sweat drips down your forehead as you continuously fire\npunches in Peter\u2019s direction, only to be met with air as he dodges them,\nturning up behind you to sweep you off your feet. Literally. </p><p>You grunt, twisting around to lie on your back for what\nfeels like the hundredth time. This isn\u2019t your first training session after you\njoined the Avengers and you definitely underestimated how hard it would be.\nFrom missions to sparring with Nat to surprise scenarios to test you it was physically\ndraining, but you had to admit that you were starting to feel at home in the\nfamily like environment. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if this was a real fight, I\u2019d just look at you\nand make you walk away,\u201d you complain, taking his hand when he offers it to\nlift you off the ground. </p><p>He shrugs at this, giving you an apologetic smile. \u201cCap says\nyou have to be prepared to fight without your powers, so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d you roll your shoulders and stand in a\nfighting stance.

That, combined with the fact his face is only inches\nfrom yours. </p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d he whispers, lightly chuckling. With your leg\nwrapped around him and his hand on your thigh you can\u2019t seem to think straight\nand you stutter, at a loss for words. When his eyes flicker down to your lips\nfor a split second, your mind goes into overdrive and a bubble of nervous\nlaughter escapes you. </p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d you whisper, eyes wide and stomach fluttering.\n\u201cIf this was in the middle of a fight, we\u2019d be dead by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing we\u2019re alone then, huh?\u201d Peter exhales and when\nhis nose brushes against yours, you realise how little the space between you\nhas become and how his lips are too far from yours for your liking. </p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s good because\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it means I can kiss you,\u201d he says and then\nimmediately closes the distance that was separating you by pressing his lips\nagainst yours. </p><p>As his hand travels up your thigh to rest on your hip, the\nother cupping the side of your face as he kisses you, you fight back a shiver.\nTrailing a hand up his abdomen, you grip his shoulder as he deepens the kiss\nand you melt into his hold, humming contentedly.</p><p>You feel him smiling into the kiss before he breaks away to\nrest his forehead against your own. </p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t out of line, was it?\u201d Peter asks a little\nbreathlessly, looking up at you through his eyelashes. \u201cI mean, you didn\u2019t push\nme away, so that\u2019s gotta count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I kissed you back, dumbass,\u201d you respond, playfully rolling\nyour eyes as you nudge his shoulder with your hand that rests there. \u201cIt kind\nof means that I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you do?\u201d he repeats with wide eyes as if he\u2019s a little\nunsure. You can also tell that underlying his expression of uncertainty is a\nsmile that\u2019s waiting to break through. </p><p>Grinning widely at this, you take his hand in your own and\nintertwine your fingers. \u201cYeah, I would have thought it was pretty obvious by\nnow, but clearly you\u2019re just as clueless! But\u2026this isn\u2019t going to be weird now,\nis it? We haven\u2019t ruined our friendship now, have we?\u201d your smile fades a little\nas you add this on, suddenly considering the situation.

A little\nawkward, talks a lot, loves making pop culture references?&rdquo; asks Tony, shifting\nuncomfortably. &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s my best\nfriend,&rdquo; you nod, a pit of guilt forming in your stomach at the mention of\nPeter. You&rsquo;ve been neglecting him for weeks because you&rsquo;re always too bruised\nup or tired to hang out recently. He probably feels the distance considering he\nhasn&rsquo;t been asking to meet up either, you note. &ldquo;You want me to do that\ninternship?&rdquo; you ask dubiously. You haven&rsquo;t even signed up for it.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been emailing each other about it, remember? I decided to\ntake you up on it,&rdquo; Tony smiles, glancing at your Dad quickly to see that he&rsquo;s\nlooking at you, perplexed. And then Tony winks at you frantically. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you start off slowly, eyes narrowed. &ldquo;The&hellip; the emails,\nyeah. I applied for the internship as well. I, uh, didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d get it so I\ndidn&rsquo;t bother telling you, Dad. S-surprise?&rdquo; you try for a casual chuckle.</p><p>To your shock, he just shrugs. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m happy for you, it sounds\ngood!&rdquo; your dad nods encouragingly. </p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, would it be okay to speak to Y/N alone?&rdquo; Tony\npolitely asks, standing up from the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll just be in the kitchen,&rdquo; your Dad responds, shaking\nTony Stark&rsquo;s hand before making his way out. </p><p>Looking at Tony suspiciously, you say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in my room if you\nneed us.&rdquo; </p><p>Gesturing for him to follow you, the two of you walk towards your\ndoor and you swallow nervously about why he&rsquo;s here. It&rsquo;s a good thing you\nremembered to put concealer on your face today.</p><p>As you take a seat nervously on the edge of your bed, Tony shuts\nthe door behind him. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;ve probably guessed there&rsquo;s no internship for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Really?&rdquo; you feign ignorance. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s surprising\nconsidering the fact that I <i>never applied</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About that,&rdquo; he sighs, forming a temple with his fingers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\njust going to get straight to it. I know who you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I kind of assumed that when you said my name,&rdquo; you roll\nyour eyes to fake nonchalance when in actuality, your heart is pounding against\nyour chest. He can&rsquo;t mean what you think he means.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny. You&rsquo;re a funny one, you remind me of Peter,&rdquo; he\nsays, but you guess that he&rsquo;s being sarcastic. &ldquo;Does he know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; you keep an impassive face, causing Tony to\nsnort. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p><p>A knowing smirk on his face, Tony pulls out his phone and\ntypes for a few seconds. Then, with a flick of his finger, he pulls up a\nrecording of New York city at night. </p><p>Your palms become clammy when a lithe and slender figure\ncomes into view, standing on the edge of a building. Dressed in all black, the\nfigure jumps from the building and lands perfectly before an electronics store\nand walking in. You watch with bated breath as the video cuts to when a glowing\nlight fills up the store and a couple of thieves walk out, empty handed. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the, uh, Supernova girl,&rdquo; you swallow, squinting\nat the video. &ldquo;Right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, so how&rsquo;d you do that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; you splutter, eyes wide. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not me, I&rsquo;m just a\nhigh school student!&rdquo;</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tony takes a seat next to you. &ldquo;Does Peter\nknow? Does your Dad even know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; you shout, without thinking. Wincing at how you just\ngave yourself a way, you bury your face in your hands. &ldquo;Neither of them can\nknow anything. They&rsquo;d be so worried, you don&rsquo;t even understand. Everyone <i>know</i>s you&rsquo;re Iron-Man. People at school would\nfreak out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I get that, you don&rsquo;t have to tell them,&rdquo; he nods, looking\nas though he wants to say something else. &ldquo;Do you know Spider-Man, by any\nchance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know of him and I&rsquo;ve seen him around,&rdquo; you furrow your\nbrows at the odd question. &ldquo;But I work alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How <i>do</i> you work?&rdquo;\nTony asks, crossing his arms and looking curious. &ldquo;Like, what makes people just\nlisten to you and stop being criminals?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you simply shrug, being truthful. &ldquo;One day,\nI went out late at night to sit in the park and draw. Then I saw some weird,\nglowing piece of debris fell out of the sky and went to see. As soon as I\ntouched it, I blacked out and woke up in my bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; Tony wrinkles his nose, dismissive. &ldquo;Not the weirdest\nthing I&rsquo;ve ever heard. So, what? You stare into people&rsquo;s eyes and they just do\nwhat you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and all my senses are heightened. It&rsquo;s&hellip; really weird,\nbut all I do is help little thefts and things around the neighbourhood. Nothing\nlike Spider-Man and you with the Avengers,&rdquo; you clarify hastily. </p><p>&ldquo;Speaking of that, how would you feel about joining the\nAvengers?&rdquo;</p><p>You blink. </p><p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; you mumble, not believing your ears. &ldquo;You want\nme to join the <i>Avengers</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes or no?&rdquo; he states, looking expectant. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask\nagain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; you exhale, heart racing. &ldquo;Yes, of course, a thousand\ntimes yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was a lot easier than he was,&rdquo; Tony mutters, raising\nan eyebrow. You decide not to question who he&rsquo;s talking about, still a little\nshaken. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your suit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M-my suit? I just wear a black hoodie and leggings most of\nthe time&hellip;&rdquo; you trail off when you spot the horrified look on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You go around fighting criminals in <i>a hoodie and leggings</i>? You do realise you could get hurt in this\njob,&rdquo; his demeanour becomes serious and almost parental as though he&rsquo;s scolding\nyou. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to send a suit then, be prepared to get one in the\nmail.&rdquo;</p><p>Before you have any chance to speak or even thank him for\nmaking you a suit, Tony stands up and walks towards the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you\ndetails via an actual email this time and we&rsquo;ll see if you&rsquo;re fit to be an\nAvenger, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Stomach churning- from excitement or nerves, you don&rsquo;t know-\nyou quickly stop him before he turns the handle. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell my Dad, will\nyou?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he assures you, but then adds as an\nafterthought, &ldquo;unless you get seriously hurt. You gotta remember that I&rsquo;m\nresponsible for your life now and I can&rsquo;t take any risks with that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair, but&hellip; you won&rsquo;t tell Peter either, right? I\nmean, he probably sees you guys whenever he goes there for the internship. I\ncan&rsquo;t let him know either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Tony nods his head, awkwardly tapping his hands\nagainst the handle of your door. &ldquo;The internship. Your secret is safe with me,&rdquo;\nhe mimes zipping his mouth and throwing away the key which causes you to let\nout a sigh of relief. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mr Stark,&rdquo; you offer him a smile as you open your door.\n&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go and lie our asses off to my Dad.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prviqpgPMi1v49vpe_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>For someone who jumps off of buildings and faces numerous\ncriminals who hold guns to your face, you really shouldn&rsquo;t be this nervous. </p><p><i>They&rsquo;re just the\nAvengers</i>, you tell yourself.

The new outfit feels foreign, but at the same time it feels like <i>you</i>. The all black theme of the\nfigure-hugging suit makes you feel light and weightless- not as restrictive as your\nhoodie, but it&rsquo;s paired with a thin hood that veils your hair, staying in place\nand a mask that covers the lower part of your face. </p><p>For dramatic purposes only, you decided to outline your eyes\nin a deep, black liner as soon as you got home from school, which is a huge\ncontrast to your usually makeup free face. Admiring how different you look from\nyour usual self, you almost don&rsquo;t notice the elevator stop and the agent waiting\noutside. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Agent Hill,&rdquo; the woman extends her hand to you with\na polite smile as you step outside the elevator. &ldquo;Tony has told me all about\nyou, and the team are highly anticipating your arrival.&rdquo;</p><p>She starts a brisk pace and you quickly run to catch up,\nstomach fluttering from anxiety. &ldquo;A-all of them?&rdquo; you say, but curse inwardly\nas soon as you realise you sound like a little kid. So much for showing you can\nbe mature. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she laughs, waving it off. &ldquo;You\naren&rsquo;t the only teenager, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>Furrowing your brows, your silence causes Agent Hill to\nglance at you when you turn a corner. &ldquo;Spider-Man,&rdquo; she says as though the one\nname is an explanation. A shake of your head leads her to elaborate. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the\nsame age as you, didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; you laugh, nervously. You&rsquo;re glad your face is\nmostly covered by your mask so that Hill can&rsquo;t see your shock written plain as\nday all over your face. &ldquo;I do know that Peter Parker is around here a lot\nbecause of the Stark Internship, do you know him by any chance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;You don&rsquo;t&hellip; Uhm. Yeah,&rdquo; she stumbles over her words,\nclearing her throat quickly. &ldquo;Yes, I do know him.&rdquo;</p><p>Her short and confusing response does nothing to calm you\nabout the possibility that your identity may accidentally be revealed to your\nunknowing best friend. &ldquo;Just a small favour&hellip; If Peter is ever here, he can&rsquo;t\nknow my real name.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep, understood,&rdquo; her answer comes clipped and she starts\nwalking faster. You soon reach a large door, which Agent Hill stops in front of.\n&ldquo;Here we are. Ready?&rdquo;</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, you nod, bracing yourself for this\nmeeting. Agent Hill opens the door after muttering a couple words into her\nearpiece that you don&rsquo;t quite catch.</p><p>As soon as the Avengers come into sight, you have to physically\nforce yourself not to let out a scream. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Supernova,&rdquo; Tony smiles proudly when he sees the powerful\neffect his suit seems to have in making you look like an actual superhero.\n&ldquo;Meet the Avengers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; you mutter, barely audible as you wave an awkward hand\nin lieu of greeting. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Steve Rogers,&rdquo; says Captain America, stepping forward to\nshake your hand. </p><p><i>Holy crap, you just\nshook hands with Captain America. </i>&ldquo;Oh, I know all of your names already,&rdquo; you\nclarify, bringing forth laughter from them all. </p><p>Sweeping a quick gaze across the room, you notice that apart\nfrom the original six Avengers, there&rsquo;s Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Scarlet Witch and\nVision. Most of them being preoccupied with their own business, you inch a\nlittle closer to Tony who&rsquo;s the only person you know well.</p><p>Before you can think about who&rsquo;s missing, Natasha cuts in.\n&ldquo;Tony, isn&rsquo;t she a little young? You want her to come on the latest mission?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can take care of myself,&rdquo; you quickly defend, not wanting\nto be labelled as a little kid on your first day of being here. </p><p>&ldquo;We have no doubts about that,&rdquo; Steve adds kindly. &ldquo;But you\nhave family and friends and school to think about too. You aren&rsquo;t as expendable\nas some of us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s actually the same age as&mdash;&rdquo; Tony starts off but is\ninterrupted by someone running into the room. &ldquo;Speak of the devil.&rdquo;</p><p>You notice that the person rushing down with his backpack on\nhis bag is none other than the red and blue clad figure of Spider-Man. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late, I just got off school and had to stop some\ncreep in an alleyway from annoying this woman, so I got a little held up and&mdash; woah,\nwho&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he comes at a stop in front of you. </p><p>His voice is so familiar that you don&rsquo;t answer. Instead, you\nstare, dumbfounded at who&rsquo;s voice you think you&rsquo;re hearing. No&hellip; It can&rsquo;t be. </p><p>Vaguely in the background you hear someone introduce you as\nSupernova, to which he responds with, &ldquo;Oh, cool, they told me you&rsquo;d be coming!\nI&rsquo;m Spider-Man, nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>Taking off his mask, you find yourself face to face with\nnone other than your best friend himself.</p><p>&ldquo;P-peter?&rdquo; you exhale, finding yourself paralysed. </p><p>He raises a brow, perplexed. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s my name. Why do\nyou sound so shocked?&rdquo; he asks, chuckling.</p><p>Hands trembling, you lift your hands to your mask,\nhesitating for a second before removing it. </p><p>He stares for a second, smile fading.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; he whispers, his mask falling out of his grasp and\nonto the floor. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> Supernova? Wha&mdash;\nwhy the fuck didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; he exclaims, incredulous. </p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash; Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you&rsquo;re Spider-Man?&rdquo; you fire\nback, equally as irked. </p><p>&ldquo;I asked first!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, what&mdash;?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you two know each other?&rdquo; Sam cuts you off, looking\namused. </p><p>Glaring daggers into Peter once more before looking to Sam,\nyou cross your arms. &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s my supposed best friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s gotta be awkward,&rdquo; Clint shakes his head in\nsympathy of your situation and the others hum in agreement. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Supposed</i>?&rdquo; Peter\nscoffs and you stare him straight in the eyes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means that you&rsquo;ve been lying to your best friend about\nthe Stark Internship! Speaking of that,&rdquo; you look at Tony to see he&rsquo;s\npretending to be preoccupied with some gadget. &ldquo;Mr Stark, would you like to\nexplain yourself now? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you knew?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, Tony knew?&rdquo; Bruce pipes up, momentarily looking over\nfrom his table and raising his eyebrows, at the man in question. &ldquo;This is on\nyou, dude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey!&rdquo; he raises his hands in surrender, wincing when\nhe sees you and Peter looking expectantly for an answer. &ldquo;In my defence, I knew\nyou&rsquo;d find out eventually and you did!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t exactly doing me a favour,&rdquo; you scowl, blood\nboiling at the fact that he kept such a huge secret from you. Well, so did you,\nbut that&rsquo;s not the point.</p><p>Whipping around to look at you, Peter looks furious, but\nafter knowing him for so long you can tell that he&rsquo;s also little hurt. &ldquo;We\naren&rsquo;t going to talk about this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a little pissed if you hadn&rsquo;t noticed,&rdquo; you reply,\ncurtly and he laughs without a trace of humour at this.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you think I&rsquo;m happy that one of the people most\nimportant to me is risking her life every day and didn&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo; Peter asks\nthis with a disbelieving tone and your heart aches with a pang. </p><p>Okay, <i>now</i> you feel\nguilty. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realise you&rsquo;re also important to me? And you&rsquo;re\nconstantly in greater danger, so how am I meant to live with that?&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha lowers her voice and mumbles something to Steve, but\nyou manage to make it out anyway. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell if they&rsquo;re arguing or making\nup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; he sighs, walking closer to you. &ldquo;And unless\nyou guys sort something out, neither of you are coming on this mission. I&rsquo;m\npairing you together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Peter says with a serious expression at the same\ntime that you exclaim otherwise.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you throw your hands up in frustration. &ldquo;Do you know\nwhat that&rsquo;s gonna be like? He literally acts like my mother half the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did not just say that, Y/N, <i>tell</i> me you did not just say that,&rdquo; Peter groans, covering his face\nwith one hand in exasperation. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if you weren&rsquo;t so annoyingly protective when I&rsquo;m\nperfectly capable of looking out for myself&hellip;&rdquo; you trail off, shooting him a\nlook. </p><p>Steve rolls his eyes at your back and forth argument and\nTony just lets out a low whistle. When you catch Natasha&rsquo;s eye, she has a little\nsmirk playing on her face. She raises her eyebrows. Before you can inquire,\nBruce walks over from his table of maps and papers along with the rest of the\nteam. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, we have a plan and we just have to debrief you all\non it now. The general idea is that we go in and disable the HYDRA weapon\nwhilst also taking out any agents on the outside. I don&rsquo;t know if we can even\ncall them HYDRA, they&rsquo;re just a bunch of psychos trying to keep the\norganisation going, but they&rsquo;re dangerous nonetheless. Y/N, listen closely\nsince this is your first time,&rdquo; Bruce informs you and the excitement makes you\nhold in a smile. </p><p>\n \n \n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvirm7XAc1v49vpe_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;I TOLD YOU TO GO LEFT!&rdquo; Peter screams through the earpiece\nwhen you land with a thump on your side next to a tree. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go <i>left</i>\nwhen there&rsquo;s someone with a gun trying to shoot at me <i>from the same side</i>,&rdquo; you groan, lifting yourself up from the ground\nand immediately whipping around to stop a blow from an agent, locking his arm\nin your hold and staring him in the eyes. Straight away his own pupils begin to\nglow and his hold relaxes, posture straightening and you can now tell him what\nto do. </p><p>&ldquo;Be a sweetheart and take down some of your own men, will\nyou?&rdquo; you smile and he nods in a trance, walking away with his gun. </p><p>&ldquo;Good job, Y/N,&rdquo; Steve says from inside the building,\npanting from exertion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost done so try and stay low now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got it, Cap,&rdquo; you respond, just as Peter lands next to\nyou from goodness knows where. </p><p>Taking off his mask, Peter stares at you in amazement. &ldquo;That\nwas awesome! All you have to do is look at them? Do they even remember\nafterwards? Wait, have you ever tried to do that to me before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, no and no,&rdquo; you list off the answers to his question,\nbut then add with a teasing tone, &ldquo;but who&rsquo;s to say I won&rsquo;t do it in the future?\nWatch out, Parker,&rdquo; you whisper the last bit and Peter&rsquo;s eyes widen as he stays\nsilent. </p><p>Suddenly a voice sounds through the earpiece and makes you\ncrack a smile. &ldquo;Y/N, you&rsquo;re scaring the kid,&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice sounds vaguely\npreoccupied and you hear a few grunts and shots going off in the background. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark, do you need help?&rdquo; Peter asks, worry lacing his\nvoice and the two of you straighten up, ready to go and help. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope, just finishing up.&rdquo; A loud clang of metal resounds\nmaking you and Peter wince. &ldquo;Getting ready to leave now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, web-slinger, can you grab Y/N and bring her to the\nship?&rdquo; Natasha yells over the sound of whirring machinery which makes you\nassume she&rsquo;s already on board. </p><p>Putting his mask back on, Peter wraps a hand around your waist\ntightly and you cling on for dear life. Where his hands are placed, you feel heat\nsearing through the material of your suit and it makes your cheeks warm up.\nConsidering this isn&rsquo;t the first time, you push the feeling down and swallow\nharshly. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he asks, hand extended upwards. </p><p>&ldquo;No, not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo; And then he shoots, lifting you off the ground to\nweb his way to the ship. You keep your eyes shut the entire way, wind blowing\naround your hood. Within seconds you find yourself standing inside the ship as\nthe exit closes slowly. </p><p>You lean on Peter for support as you get your bearings\nstraight, swaying from slight dizziness. &ldquo;Okay I never want to do that again.&rdquo;</p><p>He just chuckles in response and the two of you walk into\nthe main room where the others are gathered, most of them seated from the\nexhaustion of the mission. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys are getting old,&rdquo; Peter snickers into his fist as\nyou and him seem to be the only ones who aren&rsquo;t showing effects of running\naround in combat. &ldquo;Also, web-slinger? Really?&rdquo; he directs this at Natasha with\nraised eyebrows and an unimpressed air while she just smirks, shrugging.</p><p>&ldquo;You did good, kid,&rdquo; Tony nods at you, seeming to be\nsatisfied with your work and pride blooms in your chest at his praise. You get\nthe feeling he doesn&rsquo;t offer it much. &ldquo;Welcome to the Avengers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does this mean she gets to stay over whenever she wants?&rdquo;\nPeter asks hopefully, but the question makes you fold your arms and furrow your\nbrows.</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on, is this why you&rsquo;re never home anymore? You stay\nhere all the time?&rdquo; you scoff, shaking your head in irritation. The amount of\ntimes you decided to pay him a visit when you had a spare moment just to find\nout he wasn&rsquo;t home is ridiculous, you think to yourself. </p><p>&ldquo;Not all the time!&rdquo; he&rsquo;s quick to defend himself, raising\nhis hands as though you&rsquo;re pointing a gun at him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just leave May by\nherself all the time, I&rsquo;m only here some weekends! Plus, she knows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told Aunt May before me?&rdquo; you narrow your eyes\nsuspiciously and you can feel everyone&rsquo;s eyes moving from you to Peter, back\nand forth as you talk. &ldquo;Who else knows?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She found out by accident and so did Ned!&rdquo; he rushes to\nexplain, but upon realising what he just said, he stops and looks like a deer\ncaught in the headlights.</p><p>Taken aback, you inhale once deeply. &ldquo;<i>Ned knows</i>? And you didn&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Have I fucked up?&rdquo; Peter whispers frightfully to no one in\nparticular as you glare at him with all the anger you can muster. </p><p>Before you can say that yes, he has fucked up, Natasha\ninterrupts. &ldquo;Careful, Steve doesn&rsquo;t like that kind of language, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nat, I swear to God&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n \n \n&ldquo;<i>Language</i>.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvirtMIQG1v49vpe_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sweat drips down your forehead as you continuously fire\npunches in Peter&rsquo;s direction, only to be met with air as he dodges them,\nturning up behind you to sweep you off your feet. Literally. </p><p>You grunt, twisting around to lie on your back for what\nfeels like the hundredth time. This isn&rsquo;t your first training session after you\njoined the Avengers and you definitely underestimated how hard it would be.\nFrom missions to sparring with Nat to surprise scenarios to test you it was physically\ndraining, but you had to admit that you were starting to feel at home in the\nfamily like environment. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, if this was a real fight, I&rsquo;d just look at you\nand make you walk away,&rdquo; you complain, taking his hand when he offers it to\nlift you off the ground. </p><p>He shrugs at this, giving you an apologetic smile. &ldquo;Cap says\nyou have to be prepared to fight without your powers, so it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well,&rdquo; you roll your shoulders and stand in a\nfighting stance. You gotta say you&rsquo;re getting tired of this. &ldquo;Cap can&rsquo;t control\npeople with his eyes now, can he?&rdquo;</p><p>Then, you lunge. </p><p>Peter catches your first fist in one hand, but stumbles when\nyou kick into his side before grabbing hold of your leg and pulling you\nforward. </p><p>&ldquo;Woah,&rdquo; you gasp, falling into his chest with a force that\nknocks your breath away. That, combined with the fact his face is only inches\nfrom yours. </p><p>&ldquo;I got you,&rdquo; he whispers, lightly chuckling. With your leg\nwrapped around him and his hand on your thigh you can&rsquo;t seem to think straight\nand you stutter, at a loss for words. When his eyes flicker down to your lips\nfor a split second, your mind goes into overdrive and a bubble of nervous\nlaughter escapes you. </p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; you whisper, eyes wide and stomach fluttering.\n&ldquo;If this was in the middle of a fight, we&rsquo;d be dead by now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good thing we&rsquo;re alone then, huh?&rdquo; Peter exhales and when\nhis nose brushes against yours, you realise how little the space between you\nhas become and how his lips are too far from yours for your liking. </p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s good because&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it means I can kiss you,&rdquo; he says and then\nimmediately closes the distance that was separating you by pressing his lips\nagainst yours. </p><p>As his hand travels up your thigh to rest on your hip, the\nother cupping the side of your face as he kisses you, you fight back a shiver.\nTrailing a hand up his abdomen, you grip his shoulder as he deepens the kiss\nand you melt into his hold, humming contentedly.</p><p>You feel him smiling into the kiss before he breaks away to\nrest his forehead against your own. </p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t out of line, was it?&rdquo; Peter asks a little\nbreathlessly, looking up at you through his eyelashes. &ldquo;I mean, you didn&rsquo;t push\nme away, so that&rsquo;s gotta count for something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I kissed you back, dumbass,&rdquo; you respond, playfully rolling\nyour eyes as you nudge his shoulder with your hand that rests there. &ldquo;It kind\nof means that I like you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-you do?&rdquo; he repeats with wide eyes as if he&rsquo;s a little\nunsure. You can also tell that underlying his expression of uncertainty is a\nsmile that&rsquo;s waiting to break through. </p><p>Grinning widely at this, you take his hand in your own and\nintertwine your fingers. &ldquo;Yeah, I would have thought it was pretty obvious by\nnow, but clearly you&rsquo;re just as clueless! But&hellip;this isn&rsquo;t going to be weird now,\nis it? We haven&rsquo;t ruined our friendship now, have we?&rdquo; your smile fades a little\nas you add this on, suddenly considering the situation. Your friendship with Peter\nis the most important thing you share and you&rsquo;d never do anything to put it at\nrisk. </p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t weird unless you make it weird,&rdquo; he reassures you,\nreciprocating your exuberance at the newfound confession that hangs between\nyou. &ldquo;And yeah, we have ruined our friendship, but that can be easily fixed.&rdquo;</p><p>You tilt your head in questioning, furrowing your brows. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s\nthat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be my girlfriend?&rdquo; his voice comes out slightly doubtful, making\nit sound like a question as he sheepishly runs a hand through his hair. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re my boyfriend then,&rdquo; you fight back a smile,\nbut fail as soon as Peter&rsquo;s eyes light up and he laughs with delight, leaning\nin to press another kiss against your lips.</p><p>Just as your eyes flutter shut and Peter&rsquo;s hands thread into\nyour hair, you hear a voice that makes you jump, startling you out of Peter&rsquo;s\nhold.</p><p>&ldquo;Clint, you owe me ten bucks!&rdquo; you hear Natasha call out\nfrom somewhere outside the training room and your jaw drops, appalled that the Earth&rsquo;s\nMightiest Heroes <i>bet on you</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&ndash; l don&rsquo;t even know what to say,&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t help but shake\nyour head and laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of the situation. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you honestly surprised?&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;Nah, not really.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502e1f03fd428966a55c158fc04d7538/tumblr_inline_prvis0VChu1v49vpe_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>\n\n&copy; spideystans | 2019. no copying or reposting without permission on any platforms</b><br /></p></p>",
