He knows he should be glad they\u2019re finally getting along, but he can\u2019t ignore the tightening knot of jealousy in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, Driscoll,\u201d TJ says. \u201cWhen I first became captain, my team was a wreck. Just give them some time, and they\u2019ll improve. And if you need any help, you know where to find me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus winces. Those were some of the first words of friendship he\u2019d ever offered to TJ, and now he was passing them down to Buffy. Why did that hurt so much?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you turn so soft?\u201d Buffy asks with a teasing (and slightly sceptical) smile.</p>\n<p>TJ shrugs, flicking a look at Cyrus \u2013 so quick, he might\u2019ve imagined it \u2013 then gives Buffy one last pat on the shoulder before pulling away.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople change,\u201d he says simply.</p>\n<p>The wariness dissolves from Buffy\u2019s face, replaced with a strange sort of understanding that makes Cyrus feel out of the loop.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose they do,\u201d Buffy says. She stares at TJ for a moment longer, the two of them seemingly exchanging silent words through their eyes alone. After a while, she gives TJ a small, cryptic nod. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ says. He\u2019s still staring at Buffy, as if contemplating the secret conversation they just had right in front of him, and Cyrus wishes the floor would swallow him up. \u201cSeya.\u201d</p>\n<p>The heavy silence is pierced by the chiming of Buffy\u2019s phone, vibrating against the pocket of her shorts. She fishes it out and smiles giddily down at the text she just received. Cyrus can tell immediately who it is, just by the rare blush dusting her cheeks. He risks a glance at TJ, expecting to see a flicker of jealousy cross his face, but the older boy seems completely indifferent. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Walker,\u201d Buffy says, confirming his suspicions. \u201cHe wants to know how the try-outs went. I\u2019m meeting him at The Spoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoy your date,\u201d Cyrus offers weakly.</p>\n<p>Buffy shoots him a questioning look, but another text from Walker distracts her from whatever she was about to say. After another round of goodbyes, she walks away, still smiling down at her phone, and leaves him and TJ alone in the gym together.</p>\n<p>For too long, he doesn\u2019t know what to say. Usually, with TJ, he\u2019s at his most comfortable, but after the awkward situation that just transpired, he doesn\u2019t know how to act around him. And what\u2019s worse, TJ doesn\u2019t even seem to realise anything awkward\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>happen. He\u2019s looking at Cyrus expectantly, his eyebrows raised as he waits for him to speak. But when Cyrus simply stares down at his feet and keeps his mouth shut, TJ decides to initiate the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay, Underdog?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou seem a little\u2026 quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus scuffs his toes against the basketball court, cringing at the squeaking noise it makes, and lifts his shoulder in a half-hearted shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, I just\u2026\u201d He sucks in a deep breath and looks up at TJ. \u201cHow do you feel about Buffy and Walker dating?\u201d</p><!-- more -->\n<p>TJ frowns, so deep it cuts a crease between his brows. \u201cI don\u2019t really have an opinion, I guess. I mean, I haven\u2019t even met the guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how do you feel about Buffy\u00a0<i>dating</i>? You know, in general.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t really care?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cyrus says, trying his best to keep his voice from quivering with sadness. If he wants to support his friend, he needs to stay strong. This isn\u2019t about him. \u201cI know it sucks, having feelings for someone who doesn\u2019t like you back. If you ever wanna talk about it, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ slowly shakes his head. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour crush on Buffy,\u201d Cyrus clarifies. \u201cI know it\u2019s tough, but it gets better, I promise \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a crush on Buffy,\u201d TJ says, half choking on a startled laugh. \u201cWhy the hell would you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus deflates, all the pent-up heartbreak punching out of him like a burst balloon. He could\u2019ve sworn, based on all the soft, secretive smiles he and Buffy had been sharing during try-outs, that TJ had feelings for her. But now his mind is forced to reconsider every misinterpreted flirtation that\u2019s occurred over the past few hours. If TJ doesn\u2019t have a crush on Buffy, then why was he acting so weird around her? And why was Buffy looking at him like she knew something Cyrus didn\u2019t?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>TJ takes his arm and gives it a gentle shake. \u201cWhy did you think I had a crush on Buffy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he says, shrugging helplessly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re both sporty and confident and attractive? And it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? The captain of the boys\u2019 basketball team dating the captain of the girls\u2019 basketball team. You\u2019d be like the\u00a0<i>ultimate\u00a0</i>power couple!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do remember Buffy\u2019s got a boyfriend, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean in theory!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie, Cy. Just because me and Buffy like the same sport, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re secretly in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Buffy, okay?\u201d TJ takes him by the shoulders and stares him straight in the eye, grounding him with his steady gaze. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends. And we probably wouldn\u2019t even be\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus allows himself to breathe, his shoulders slumping beneath TJ\u2019s large hands. He\u2019s still looking into TJ\u2019s eyes, privately picking out the flecks of blue and brown swimming in the pools of pale green. For a big, scary jock, TJ is unfairly pretty. He has to hold back a dreamy sigh as he continues to stare, any shame he should be feeling clouded by the undeniable beauty of the boy standing before him. If he were braver, he\u2019d tell TJ how handsome he is. He wonders if anyone has told him that before. It seems unlikely that he\u2019s the first person to notice how stunning he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d he says, his words slightly groggy as he shakes himself out of his daze.</p>\n<p>TJ quirks an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s a relief?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou not liking Buffy,\u201d Cyrus says. It\u2019s only when TJ\u2019s eyes widen that he realises how that might sound, like he\u2019s glad TJ doesn\u2019t have a crush on Buffy because, well\u2026 It\u2019s exactly how it sounds, but he doesn\u2019t want TJ to know that, so he adds, \u201cBuffy really likes Walker, so it\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have feelings for her. You\u2019d only get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d TJ says. He sounds slightly disappointed, but that\u2019s probably just Cyrus hearing what he wants to hear.</p>\n<p>A few minutes pass in silence. TJ lets his hands slip from Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and hang by his sides, twitching with the urge to do something. That\u2019s a nervous habit of TJ\u2019s: when he\u2019s feeling anxious or stressed, he likes to keep his hands occupied to distract himself. Cyrus has always found it endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you mean before?\u201d TJ suddenly asks, making him jump. \u201cWhen you said you knew it sucks, having feelings for someone who doesn\u2019t like you back. Have you\u2026 been through that before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus wrings his hands together, mirroring TJ\u2019s nervousness. \u201cI, um\u2026 Yeah. I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJonah,\u201d he says, not giving himself a chance to reconsider telling TJ the truth. \u201cIt was Jonah Beck. When he and Andi started dating, we became friends, and I\u2026 Well, I kind of became infatuated with him.\u201d He tries to laugh, but it comes out as a gargled and pitiful squeak instead. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ presses his lips together. The expression on his face is unreadable, but if Cyrus had to take a guess, he\u2019d say he was upset for some reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pathetic,\u201d TJ says, his voice small and broken. \u201cDo you\u2026 Do you still like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cyrus says. He can\u2019t help but smile at how easy it is to say that now. A few months ago, the idea of getting over Jonah seemed impossible, like an eternal prison inside his mind, but now his heart doesn\u2019t so much as pinch at the thought of Jonah being with someone else.</p>\n<p>TJ swallows thickly, his fingers flexing and unflexing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Cyrus frowns. \u201cBecause Jonah likes Andi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d TJ clenches his fists and takes a step closer, his eyes flitting back and forth across Cyrus\u2019 face. Up close, he can see his jaw is trembling, and Cyrus has to refrain from reaching forward and easing his nerves with the brush of his fingertips. He\u2019s\u00a0<i>this\u00a0</i>close to caving in and touching him when TJ takes him by surprise and says, \u201cBecause\u00a0<i>I\u00a0</i>like\u00a0<i>you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He freezes, his heart ceasing in his chest. All he can do is open and close his mouth, but no sound comes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like me back,\u201d TJ says before Cyrus can remember how to speak again. \u201cI mean, five minutes ago you thought I had a thing for Buffy, so\u2026 you obviously think I\u2019m straight.\u201d</p>\n<p>The complete and utter defeat on TJ\u2019s face is enough to snap him out of his stupor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0think you were straight,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like you! I tried not to at first, because of what happened with Jonah, but I couldn\u2019t help it. And since you and Buffy became friends, you\u2019ve been really weird and secretive around each other, so I just assumed\u2026 I mean, I never even\u00a0<i>hoped</i>\u00a0you might like me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ looks at him in stunned silence for a moment, and then a blinding grin breaks across his face. He ducks his head, dirty-blond hair flopping over his forehead, and chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuffy knows I like you,\u201d he says, his words wobbly with laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been acting weird around her. She figured it out a few weeks ago, and she\u2019s been trying to convince me to tell you ever since. Today, before try-outs, I told her I was gonna tell you after everyone was gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>The meaningful smiles and nods suddenly make sense.

I mean, I haven\u2019t even met the guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how do you feel about Buffy\u00a0<i>dating</i>? You know, in general.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t really care?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cyrus says, trying his best to keep his voice from quivering with sadness. If he wants to support his friend, he needs to stay strong. This isn\u2019t about him. \u201cI know it sucks, having feelings for someone who doesn\u2019t like you back. If you ever wanna talk about it, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ slowly shakes his head. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour crush on Buffy,\u201d Cyrus clarifies. \u201cI know it\u2019s tough, but it gets better, I promise \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a crush on Buffy,\u201d TJ says, half choking on a startled laugh. \u201cWhy the hell would you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus deflates, all the pent-up heartbreak punching out of him like a burst balloon. He could\u2019ve sworn, based on all the soft, secretive smiles he and Buffy had been sharing during try-outs, that TJ had feelings for her. But now his mind is forced to reconsider every misinterpreted flirtation that\u2019s occurred over the past few hours. If TJ doesn\u2019t have a crush on Buffy, then why was he acting so weird around her? And why was Buffy looking at him like she knew something Cyrus didn\u2019t?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>TJ takes his arm and gives it a gentle shake. \u201cWhy did you think I had a crush on Buffy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he says, shrugging helplessly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re both sporty and confident and attractive? And it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? The captain of the boys\u2019 basketball team dating the captain of the girls\u2019 basketball team. You\u2019d be like the\u00a0<i>ultimate\u00a0</i>power couple!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do remember Buffy\u2019s got a boyfriend, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean in theory!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie, Cy. Just because me and Buffy like the same sport, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re secretly in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Buffy, okay?\u201d TJ takes him by the shoulders and stares him straight in the eye, grounding him with his steady gaze. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends. And we probably wouldn\u2019t even be\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus allows himself to breathe, his shoulders slumping beneath TJ\u2019s large hands. He\u2019s still looking into TJ\u2019s eyes, privately picking out the flecks of blue and brown swimming in the pools of pale green. For a big, scary jock, TJ is unfairly pretty. He has to hold back a dreamy sigh as he continues to stare, any shame he should be feeling clouded by the undeniable beauty of the boy standing before him. If he were braver, he\u2019d tell TJ how handsome he is. He wonders if anyone has told him that before. It seems unlikely that he\u2019s the first person to notice how stunning he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d he says, his words slightly groggy as he shakes himself out of his daze.</p>\n<p>TJ quirks an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s a relief?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou not liking Buffy,\u201d Cyrus says. It\u2019s only when TJ\u2019s eyes widen that he realises how that might sound, like he\u2019s glad TJ doesn\u2019t have a crush on Buffy because, well\u2026 It\u2019s exactly how it sounds, but he doesn\u2019t want TJ to know that, so he adds, \u201cBuffy really likes Walker, so it\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have feelings for her. You\u2019d only get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d TJ says. He sounds slightly disappointed, but that\u2019s probably just Cyrus hearing what he wants to hear.</p>\n<p>A few minutes pass in silence. TJ lets his hands slip from Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and hang by his sides, twitching with the urge to do something. That\u2019s a nervous habit of TJ\u2019s: when he\u2019s feeling anxious or stressed, he likes to keep his hands occupied to distract himself. Cyrus has always found it endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you mean before?\u201d TJ suddenly asks, making him jump. \u201cWhen you said you knew it sucks, having feelings for someone who doesn\u2019t like you back. Have you\u2026 been through that before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus wrings his hands together, mirroring TJ\u2019s nervousness. \u201cI, um\u2026 Yeah. I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJonah,\u201d he says, not giving himself a chance to reconsider telling TJ the truth. \u201cIt was Jonah Beck. When he and Andi started dating, we became friends, and I\u2026 Well, I kind of became infatuated with him.\u201d He tries to laugh, but it comes out as a gargled and pitiful squeak instead. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ presses his lips together. The expression on his face is unreadable, but if Cyrus had to take a guess, he\u2019d say he was upset for some reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pathetic,\u201d TJ says, his voice small and broken. \u201cDo you\u2026 Do you still like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cyrus says. He can\u2019t help but smile at how easy it is to say that now. A few months ago, the idea of getting over Jonah seemed impossible, like an eternal prison inside his mind, but now his heart doesn\u2019t so much as pinch at the thought of Jonah being with someone else.</p>\n<p>TJ swallows thickly, his fingers flexing and unflexing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Cyrus frowns. \u201cBecause Jonah likes Andi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d TJ clenches his fists and takes a step closer, his eyes flitting back and forth across Cyrus\u2019 face. Up close, he can see his jaw is trembling, and Cyrus has to refrain from reaching forward and easing his nerves with the brush of his fingertips. He\u2019s\u00a0<i>this\u00a0</i>close to caving in and touching him when TJ takes him by surprise and says, \u201cBecause\u00a0<i>I\u00a0</i>like\u00a0<i>you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He freezes, his heart ceasing in his chest. All he can do is open and close his mouth, but no sound comes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like me back,\u201d TJ says before Cyrus can remember how to speak again. \u201cI mean, five minutes ago you thought I had a thing for Buffy, so\u2026 you obviously think I\u2019m straight.\u201d</p>\n<p>The complete and utter defeat on TJ\u2019s face is enough to snap him out of his stupor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0think you were straight,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like you! I tried not to at first, because of what happened with Jonah, but I couldn\u2019t help it. And since you and Buffy became friends, you\u2019ve been really weird and secretive around each other, so I just assumed\u2026 I mean, I never even\u00a0<i>hoped</i>\u00a0you might like me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ looks at him in stunned silence for a moment, and then a blinding grin breaks across his face. He ducks his head, dirty-blond hair flopping over his forehead, and chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuffy knows I like you,\u201d he says, his words wobbly with laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been acting weird around her. She figured it out a few weeks ago, and she\u2019s been trying to convince me to tell you ever since. Today, before try-outs, I told her I was gonna tell you after everyone was gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>The meaningful smiles and nods suddenly make sense. Buffy and TJ weren\u2019t flirting with each other; TJ was looking to Buffy for encouragement, and Buffy was offering her support through quiet gestures. Looking back, it was so obvious. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, this is a twist,\u201d he says, a hesitant smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve been stressing over this for weeks! I thought I was gonna have to console you about Buffy, and I was\u00a0<i>not\u00a0</i>looking forward to it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ gives him a lopsided grin, stepping closer until the toes of their shoes are touching.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might still need consoling,\u201d he says teasingly, \u201cdepending on your answer to my next question.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus tilts his head to the side. \u201cWhat question?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Before the situation has even fully registered in his brain, Cyrus flings his arms around TJ, giggling like a pre-schooler as the older boy lifts him up and spins him around. The gym melts into a brown blur around them, and all he can see is the sparkle in TJ\u2019s eyes, staring up at him with so much affection, it makes his heart ache. He buries his face in the crook of TJ\u2019s neck and grins wider than he\u2019s ever grinned before. By the time TJ lowers him back to the ground, his jaw is sore from smiling so much, but he couldn\u2019t care less, not when TJ is smiling just as brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn case I wasn\u2019t clear,\u201d he says, slightly out of breath, \u201cthat was a \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ takes his hand and kisses it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p>",

Those were some of the first words of friendship he\u2019d ever offered to TJ, and now he was passing them down to Buffy. Why did that hurt so much?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you turn so soft?\u201d Buffy asks with a teasing (and slightly sceptical) smile.</p>\n<p>TJ shrugs, flicking a look at Cyrus \u2013 so quick, he might\u2019ve imagined it \u2013 then gives Buffy one last pat on the shoulder before pulling away.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople change,\u201d he says simply.</p>\n<p>The wariness dissolves from Buffy\u2019s face, replaced with a strange sort of understanding that makes Cyrus feel out of the loop.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose they do,\u201d Buffy says. She stares at TJ for a moment longer, the two of them seemingly exchanging silent words through their eyes alone. After a while, she gives TJ a small, cryptic nod. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ says. He\u2019s still staring at Buffy, as if contemplating the secret conversation they just had right in front of him, and Cyrus wishes the floor would swallow him up. \u201cSeya.\u201d</p>\n<p>The heavy silence is pierced by the chiming of Buffy\u2019s phone, vibrating against the pocket of her shorts. She fishes it out and smiles giddily down at the text she just received. Cyrus can tell immediately who it is, just by the rare blush dusting her cheeks. He risks a glance at TJ, expecting to see a flicker of jealousy cross his face, but the older boy seems completely indifferent. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Walker,\u201d Buffy says, confirming his suspicions. \u201cHe wants to know how the try-outs went. I\u2019m meeting him at The Spoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoy your date,\u201d Cyrus offers weakly.</p>\n<p>Buffy shoots him a questioning look, but another text from Walker distracts her from whatever she was about to say. After another round of goodbyes, she walks away, still smiling down at her phone, and leaves him and TJ alone in the gym together.</p>\n<p>For too long, he doesn\u2019t know what to say. Usually, with TJ, he\u2019s at his most comfortable, but after the awkward situation that just transpired, he doesn\u2019t know how to act around him. And what\u2019s worse, TJ doesn\u2019t even seem to realise anything awkward\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>happen. He\u2019s looking at Cyrus expectantly, his eyebrows raised as he waits for him to speak. But when Cyrus simply stares down at his feet and keeps his mouth shut, TJ decides to initiate the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay, Underdog?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou seem a little\u2026 quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus scuffs his toes against the basketball court, cringing at the squeaking noise it makes, and lifts his shoulder in a half-hearted shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, I just\u2026\u201d He sucks in a deep breath and looks up at TJ. \u201cHow do you feel about Buffy and Walker dating?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]\n<p>TJ frowns, so deep it cuts a crease between his brows. \u201cI don\u2019t really have an opinion, I guess. I mean, I haven\u2019t even met the guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how do you feel about Buffy\u00a0<i>dating</i>? You know, in general.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t really care?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cyrus says, trying his best to keep his voice from quivering with sadness. If he wants to support his friend, he needs to stay strong. This isn\u2019t about him. \u201cI know it sucks, having feelings for someone who doesn\u2019t like you back. If you ever wanna talk about it, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ slowly shakes his head. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour crush on Buffy,\u201d Cyrus clarifies. \u201cI know it\u2019s tough, but it gets better, I promise \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a crush on Buffy,\u201d TJ says, half choking on a startled laugh. \u201cWhy the hell would you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus deflates, all the pent-up heartbreak punching out of him like a burst balloon. He could\u2019ve sworn, based on all the soft, secretive smiles he and Buffy had been sharing during try-outs, that TJ had feelings for her. But now his mind is forced to reconsider every misinterpreted flirtation that\u2019s occurred over the past few hours. If TJ doesn\u2019t have a crush on Buffy, then why was he acting so weird around her? And why was Buffy looking at him like she knew something Cyrus didn\u2019t?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>TJ takes his arm and gives it a gentle shake. \u201cWhy did you think I had a crush on Buffy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he says, shrugging helplessly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re both sporty and confident and attractive? And it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? The captain of the boys\u2019 basketball team dating the captain of the girls\u2019 basketball team. You\u2019d be like the\u00a0<i>ultimate\u00a0</i>power couple!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do remember Buffy\u2019s got a boyfriend, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean in theory!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie, Cy. Just because me and Buffy like the same sport, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re secretly in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Buffy, okay?\u201d TJ takes him by the shoulders and stares him straight in the eye, grounding him with his steady gaze. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends. And we probably wouldn\u2019t even be\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus allows himself to breathe, his shoulders slumping beneath TJ\u2019s large hands. He\u2019s still looking into TJ\u2019s eyes, privately picking out the flecks of blue and brown swimming in the pools of pale green. For a big, scary jock, TJ is unfairly pretty. He has to hold back a dreamy sigh as he continues to stare, any shame he should be feeling clouded by the undeniable beauty of the boy standing before him. If he were braver, he\u2019d tell TJ how handsome he is. He wonders if anyone has told him that before. It seems unlikely that he\u2019s the first person to notice how stunning he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d he says, his words slightly groggy as he shakes himself out of his daze.</p>\n<p>TJ quirks an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s a relief?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou not liking Buffy,\u201d Cyrus says. It\u2019s only when TJ\u2019s eyes widen that he realises how that might sound, like he\u2019s glad TJ doesn\u2019t have a crush on Buffy because, well\u2026 It\u2019s exactly how it sounds, but he doesn\u2019t want TJ to know that, so he adds, \u201cBuffy really likes Walker, so it\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have feelings for her. You\u2019d only get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d TJ says. He sounds slightly disappointed, but that\u2019s probably just Cyrus hearing what he wants to hear.</p>\n<p>A few minutes pass in silence. TJ lets his hands slip from Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and hang by his sides, twitching with the urge to do something. That\u2019s a nervous habit of TJ\u2019s: when he\u2019s feeling anxious or stressed, he likes to keep his hands occupied to distract himself. Cyrus has always found it endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you mean before?\u201d TJ suddenly asks, making him jump. \u201cWhen you said you knew it sucks, having feelings for someone who doesn\u2019t like you back. Have you\u2026 been through that before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus wrings his hands together, mirroring TJ\u2019s nervousness. \u201cI, um\u2026 Yeah. I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJonah,\u201d he says, not giving himself a chance to reconsider telling TJ the truth. \u201cIt was Jonah Beck. When he and Andi started dating, we became friends, and I\u2026 Well, I kind of became infatuated with him.\u201d He tries to laugh, but it comes out as a gargled and pitiful squeak instead. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ presses his lips together. The expression on his face is unreadable, but if Cyrus had to take a guess, he\u2019d say he was upset for some reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pathetic,\u201d TJ says, his voice small and broken. \u201cDo you\u2026 Do you still like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cyrus says. He can\u2019t help but smile at how easy it is to say that now. A few months ago, the idea of getting over Jonah seemed impossible, like an eternal prison inside his mind, but now his heart doesn\u2019t so much as pinch at the thought of Jonah being with someone else.</p>\n<p>TJ swallows thickly, his fingers flexing and unflexing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Cyrus frowns. \u201cBecause Jonah likes Andi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d TJ clenches his fists and takes a step closer, his eyes flitting back and forth across Cyrus\u2019 face. Up close, he can see his jaw is trembling, and Cyrus has to refrain from reaching forward and easing his nerves with the brush of his fingertips. He\u2019s\u00a0<i>this\u00a0</i>close to caving in and touching him when TJ takes him by surprise and says, \u201cBecause\u00a0<i>I\u00a0</i>like\u00a0<i>you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He freezes, his heart ceasing in his chest. All he can do is open and close his mouth, but no sound comes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like me back,\u201d TJ says before Cyrus can remember how to speak again. \u201cI mean, five minutes ago you thought I had a thing for Buffy, so\u2026 you obviously think I\u2019m straight.\u201d</p>\n<p>The complete and utter defeat on TJ\u2019s face is enough to snap him out of his stupor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0think you were straight,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like you! I tried not to at first, because of what happened with Jonah, but I couldn\u2019t help it. And since you and Buffy became friends, you\u2019ve been really weird and secretive around each other, so I just assumed\u2026 I mean, I never even\u00a0<i>hoped</i>\u00a0you might like me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ looks at him in stunned silence for a moment, and then a blinding grin breaks across his face. He ducks his head, dirty-blond hair flopping over his forehead, and chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuffy knows I like you,\u201d he says, his words wobbly with laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been acting weird around her. She figured it out a few weeks ago, and she\u2019s been trying to convince me to tell you ever since. Today, before try-outs, I told her I was gonna tell you after everyone was gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>The meaningful smiles and nods suddenly make sense. Buffy and TJ weren\u2019t flirting with each other; TJ was looking to Buffy for encouragement, and Buffy was offering her support through quiet gestures. Looking back, it was so obvious. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, this is a twist,\u201d he says, a hesitant smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve been stressing over this for weeks! I thought I was gonna have to console you about Buffy, and I was\u00a0<i>not\u00a0</i>looking forward to it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ gives him a lopsided grin, stepping closer until the toes of their shoes are touching.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might still need consoling,\u201d he says teasingly, \u201cdepending on your answer to my next question.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cyrus tilts his head to the side. \u201cWhat question?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Before the situation has even fully registered in his brain, Cyrus flings his arms around TJ, giggling like a pre-schooler as the older boy lifts him up and spins him around. The gym melts into a brown blur around them, and all he can see is the sparkle in TJ\u2019s eyes, staring up at him with so much affection, it makes his heart ache. He buries his face in the crook of TJ\u2019s neck and grins wider than he\u2019s ever grinned before. By the time TJ lowers him back to the ground, his jaw is sore from smiling so much, but he couldn\u2019t care less, not when TJ is smiling just as brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn case I wasn\u2019t clear,\u201d he says, slightly out of breath, \u201cthat was a \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>TJ takes his hand and kisses it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p>",

I thought I was gonna have to console you about Buffy, and I was&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>looking forward to it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>TJ gives him a lopsided grin, stepping closer until the toes of their shoes are touching.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I might still need consoling,&rdquo; he says teasingly, &ldquo;depending on your answer to my next question.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus tilts his head to the side. &ldquo;What question?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Will you go out with me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Before the situation has even fully registered in his brain, Cyrus flings his arms around TJ, giggling like a pre-schooler as the older boy lifts him up and spins him around. The gym melts into a brown blur around them, and all he can see is the sparkle in TJ&rsquo;s eyes, staring up at him with so much affection, it makes his heart ache. He buries his face in the crook of TJ&rsquo;s neck and grins wider than he&rsquo;s ever grinned before. By the time TJ lowers him back to the ground, his jaw is sore from smiling so much, but he couldn&rsquo;t care less, not when TJ is smiling just as brightly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In case I wasn&rsquo;t clear,&rdquo; he says, slightly out of breath, &ldquo;that was a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>TJ takes his hand and kisses it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief.&rdquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><i>Seeing my boy TJ in the promo gave me enough energy to write this in half the time it usually takes me&nbsp;</i>&#128517;</p>\n<p><i>Summary ~&nbsp;When TJ and Buffy start acting strangely around each other, Cyrus misinterprets the situation and thinks TJ has a crush on Buffy.<br /></i></p>\n<p><i>Also available on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16380533\">AO3</a> &hearts;</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Buffy says, slinging her gym bag over her shoulder, &ldquo;that was&hellip; interesting.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>TJ huffs a laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll get better.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I certainly don&rsquo;t think it could get any&nbsp;<i>worse</i>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus watches as TJ reaches forward and squeezes Buffy&rsquo;s shoulder, a reassuring smile softening his face. He knows he should be glad they&rsquo;re finally getting along, but he can&rsquo;t ignore the tightening knot of jealousy in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Trust me, Driscoll,&rdquo; TJ says. &ldquo;When I first became captain, my team was a wreck. Just give them some time, and they&rsquo;ll improve. And if you need any help, you know where to find me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus winces. Those were some of the first words of friendship he&rsquo;d ever offered to TJ, and now he was passing them down to Buffy. Why did that hurt so much?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When did you turn so soft?&rdquo; Buffy asks with a teasing (and slightly sceptical) smile.</p>\n<p>TJ shrugs, flicking a look at Cyrus &ndash; so quick, he might&rsquo;ve imagined it &ndash; then gives Buffy one last pat on the shoulder before pulling away.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People change,&rdquo; he says simply.</p>\n<p>The wariness dissolves from Buffy&rsquo;s face, replaced with a strange sort of understanding that makes Cyrus feel out of the loop.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I suppose they do,&rdquo; Buffy says. She stares at TJ for a moment longer, the two of them seemingly exchanging silent words through their eyes alone. After a while, she gives TJ a small, cryptic nod. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll see you guys tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; TJ says. He&rsquo;s still staring at Buffy, as if contemplating the secret conversation they just had right in front of him, and Cyrus wishes the floor would swallow him up. &ldquo;Seya.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The heavy silence is pierced by the chiming of Buffy&rsquo;s phone, vibrating against the pocket of her shorts. She fishes it out and smiles giddily down at the text she just received. Cyrus can tell immediately who it is, just by the rare blush dusting her cheeks. He risks a glance at TJ, expecting to see a flicker of jealousy cross his face, but the older boy seems completely indifferent. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Walker,&rdquo; Buffy says, confirming his suspicions. &ldquo;He wants to know how the try-outs went. I&rsquo;m meeting him at The Spoon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Enjoy your date,&rdquo; Cyrus offers weakly.</p>\n<p>Buffy shoots him a questioning look, but another text from Walker distracts her from whatever she was about to say. After another round of goodbyes, she walks away, still smiling down at her phone, and leaves him and TJ alone in the gym together.</p>\n<p>For too long, he doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. Usually, with TJ, he&rsquo;s at his most comfortable, but after the awkward situation that just transpired, he doesn&rsquo;t know how to act around him. And what&rsquo;s worse, TJ doesn&rsquo;t even seem to realise anything awkward&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>happen. He&rsquo;s looking at Cyrus expectantly, his eyebrows raised as he waits for him to speak. But when Cyrus simply stares down at his feet and keeps his mouth shut, TJ decides to initiate the conversation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You okay, Underdog?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;You seem a little&hellip; quiet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus scuffs his toes against the basketball court, cringing at the squeaking noise it makes, and lifts his shoulder in a half-hearted shrug.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I just&hellip;&rdquo; He sucks in a deep breath and looks up at TJ. &ldquo;How do you feel about Buffy and Walker dating?&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
