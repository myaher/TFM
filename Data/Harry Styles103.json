        "body": "<p><i>You\u2019ve been struggling with insomnia and forget a very important date.</i></p><p><b><i>A/N: Hi loves! I wrote this like a month ago just before I started posting when I was struggling to sleep, and it\u2019s become a problem for me again so I thought I\u2019d put it out there for you! It\u2019s not very long, 1k of half angst half fluff. LOVE AND HUGS &lt;3 Kate xx</i></b></p><p><i></i><b></b><b></b><i></i>Five nights in a row now you\u2019ve struggled sleeping. You\u2019re not sure why, and you\u2019re not sure how to help it, but you know it\u2019s beginning to be a bit of a piss take. You\u2019d have no trouble getting to sleep, it had always taken you a while anyway, maybe an hour or so to succumb to unconsciousness, that was normal. But every night for almost a week now you\u2019ve woken at around the same time - between midnight and one-ish - to find yourself wide awake for hours, rolling around the bed for no reason other than that you\u2019re uncomfortable and wanted to find a good position to sleep in. That and that your brain for some reason wouldn\u2019t keep its noise down.</p><p>There was only one solution you\u2019ve come up with to get over it. It might seem a little obvious now but you don\u2019t like to drink in the week for various reasons. So as Friday night finally roll around, you force yourself to stay awake later than usual, open a bottle of red you\u2019ve been saving, and stick your boyfriend\u2019s face on the telly.</p><p>It\u2019s already nine o\u2019clock by this point, and you can feel your eyes drooping before your love\u2019s face has even appeared on the screen.</p><p>What you\u2019re not expecting was the sound of a key turning in your front door. Only one person had a key for your flat, and that one person wasn\u2019t due to visit for another week. Or so you thought anyway.</p><p>Harry\u2019s lanky frame peers around the doorway with an adorable smile, dimples on full display and teeth peeking through his lips. \u201cHey you.\u201d</p><p>You stare up at him for a moment, eyebrows knitting together as you blink over and over in utter confusion. <i>It was another week right..? He\u2019s not supposed to be here until a weeks time. That was the plan. The weekend before his birthday?</i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Harry asks into your silence, standing straight and stepping into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a week early?\u201d You speak quietly, because you\u2019re not even certain of yourself with your question.</p><p>Harry frowns at you, eyes burning with worry as he approaches your frame that\u2019s buried between blankets and cushions in the corner of your sofa. \u201cNo&hellip; it\u2019s the twenty-fifth, love. Like we said.\u201d He crouches down as he speaks, his voice so lovely and warm but thick with concern.</p><p>You look from Harry to the digital clock on the wall in her kitchen. And there it is; Friday 25th January, 21:30. \u201cHoly fucking shit balls.\u201d You grumble. You\u2019ve lost an entire fucking week.</p><p>The bags under your eyes are obvious now as Harry watches her, a sickening feeling growing in the pit of his stomach. You look exhausted, like you haven\u2019t slept for a month, or overworked to the point you might collapse.

And there it is; Friday 25th January, 21:30. &ldquo;Holy fucking shit balls.&rdquo; You grumble. You&rsquo;ve lost an entire fucking week.</p><p>The bags under your eyes are obvious now as Harry watches her, a sickening feeling growing in the pit of his stomach. You look exhausted, like you haven&rsquo;t slept for a month, or overworked to the point you might collapse. And just as he was about to ask you what&rsquo;s wrong you begin to flood with tears, your entire being shaking from your wracking sobs.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Harry coos, shuffling around you to bring you into his lap, one arm around your middle as the other hand pushes through your soft hair, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happened, love?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck is happening to me.&rdquo; You cry, wiping your wet face with the back of your hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost an entire week of my life, I&rsquo;ve barely slept all week, work has been <i>fucking tedious</i>, and now you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can go back home if y-,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You scream, your head hitting his chest in frustration. &ldquo;Fuck, H, that&rsquo;s the last thing I want.&rdquo; You whimper, your hand roaming his chest and neck, eventually bunching into the hair at the back of his neck. &ldquo;Even put you on the fucking telly because I missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>A soft chuckle escapes him as he glances at the TV to see <i>Dunkirk</i> paused fairly early on. &ldquo;Then help me out a bit &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m confused.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had so much planned for when you came home, well not home but here.&rdquo; You sigh, pulling away slightly to look at him properly. &ldquo;Was gonna have dinner ready for you, I had a whole list of things to go and get for you and I don&rsquo;t know what the hell happened but I just fucking forgot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, lovie.&rdquo; Harry assures you, wiping another stray tear from your cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;It matters to me though, H.&rdquo; You stress, unable to stop your hand fiddling with a stray curl by his ear. &ldquo;You absolutely spoiled me on my birthday and I wanted to do the same for you, especially since I can&rsquo;t come with you to celebrate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late anyway.&rdquo; He brushes the subject, placing a sweet kiss to your forehead. &ldquo;We agreed eight and it&rsquo;s already nine-thirty. So you carry on watching me on the telly like you planned, I&rsquo;ll make myself something to eat and we can finish the evening the way you had planned <i>today</i>. <i>Tomorrow</i> maybe you can do what you&rsquo;d originally planned?&rdquo;</p><p>You watch him for a while, not really sure how to respond. Your exhaustion is making you stupid. <i>That was a perfectly sound plan wasn&rsquo;t it? It sounds like it&hellip; </i>You nod slowly, your hand automatically reaching up to bite your nails.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi,&rdquo; Harry scolds, snatching your hand away from your mouth, &ldquo;told you to stop doing that.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re about to protest but you know he&rsquo;s right. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; You mumble, curling into him.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, you know.&rdquo; He hums as his chin rests on your head. &ldquo;Hate it when you&rsquo;re not with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; You say with more confidence than anything else you&rsquo;ve said all evening. Your hand slips between the fabric of his shirt to rest against his warm skin. &ldquo;Maybe one day we&rsquo;ll spend every day together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that sounds a reasonable idea.&rdquo; Harry agrees, pecking the top of your head again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to see what I can do about it.&rdquo;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>~~~</p><p>Mwah!</p>",
