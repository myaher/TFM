Plain and simple, average features with a little more to love around the edges and it always made you so insecure to stand next to these model thin women with their slim flutes of champagne. You sighed and brushed your hands down your front, trying to smooth away non-existent wrinkles in the fabric of your dress; it was a <a href=\"https://www.ericdress.com/product/One-Shoulder-Sequins-A-Line-Evening-Dress-13087614.html\">gold sequined number</a> with a scoop neckline that accentuated your breasts in the best possible way, it hugged you perfectly to give you that classic hourglass figure that guys claimed to fall down over but you still found yourself as single. But no matter how much you hated the parties, being on the direct Stark payroll meant your mandatory attendance.<br/></p><p>Your phone chirped on the desk and you hit the home button to bring up the text message. It was from your boss, Tony Stark, wondering where you were. You smiled softly and returned to your mirror where you replied a coat of your favorite shade of lipstick before throwing it in your little black clutch and headed up to the rooftop where this shindig was being thrown. You took a deep breath to steel your nerves and put your pleasant Stark assistant face on as the elevator opened up to the rooftop. You looked up from the entrance platform out on the sea of perfectly trimmed topiary and fairy lights.

Tony Stark stood in front of you in a navy blue suit with a silvery silk shirt underneath. The top few buttons were open, flashing a bit of chest hair and the soft glow from his arc reactor. His brown hair was gelled to a perfectly tousled mess and his black rimmed glasses were void of the rosy hue the lenses normally had to hide the red of his eyes from lack of sleep. </p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Stark,\u201d you responded stiffly, raising your glass to your painted lips once more. </p><p>Tony frowned and fiddled with the cuff links on his jacket. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s been three months now and every day I tell you to call me Tony.\u201d</p><p>Your smile falters for a moment before you nod in understanding. \u201cSure thing, boss,\u201d you tease, skirting around getting too informal with the man himself. He rolls his eyes, knowing what you were doing. \u201cAre there any important people here that I should be taking note of?\u201d You ask to distract him as you open your clutch to fish your phone out. No matter how tiny your purse was it never ceased to amaze you how your phone always got lost in them. </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand reached out and settled gently on yours. \u201cYou\u2019re off duty tonight, Y/N. Come dance with me.\u201d You opened your mouth to protest but he held his hand out. \u201cCome on, it\u2019ll show them I still have good taste.\u201d </p><p>You snorted inelegantly, but placed your hand in his none the less. Tony pulled you out onto the dance floor and even with your hand folded in his and your other arm draped around his neck you couldn\u2019t help but anxiously cast your eyes around and focus in on the women who did double takes every time they noticed who Tony Stark was bothering to dance with. You flushed and dipped your head slightly, your hair falling to hide your face as Tony spun you both slowly around the floor.</p><p>Tony pulled away from you a little to look at you properly and brushed the hair out of your face to tuck it behind your ear. \u201cI can\u2019t be that bad of a dancer,\u201d Tony teased, trying to lighten whatever mood had you suddenly downtrodden. </p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like everyone staring,\u201d you murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re just trying to figure out where I hide the super suit,\u201d Tony continued to joke.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re trying to figure out if I\u2019m going to be the next woman to try and tame Tony Stark. They\u2019re either feeling bad for me or brushing me off because I\u2019m very obviously not your type,\u201d you answer with a little more venom then you meant, it shocked you a little the ferociousness of it but it didn\u2019t seem to faze Tony in the slightest. </p><p>One of Tony\u2019s eyebrows raised and the corner of his mouth quirked up in a boyish smirk. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I had a type.\u201d </p><p>The tempo of the band had picked up, but Tony continued to move around the dance floor at his own pace. It was a such a Tony Stark thing, it didn\u2019t matter what everyone else around him was doing he was always going to do what he thinks is best regardless. </p><p>You laughed at what you assumed was his feigned ignorance. \u201cPlease, Tony. Look,<b> I have 99 problems and my curves ain\u2019t one</b>, but they obviously aren\u2019t your type. That\u2019s okay, everyone has a type.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s brows furrowed in contemplation and he simply hummed in understanding, his lips pursed slightly. You were about to apologize, afraid to have offended the man, when the cloudy look disappeared from his face and he retrained his laser vision to you. </p><p>\u201cWell, I can assume short aging men aren\u2019t your type. So maybe they\u2019re all pitying me,\u201d Tony shot at you. You narrowed your eyes, his tone came off as him trying a little too hard to be flippant. </p><p>\u201cShows what you know. Silver foxes are very much my thing.\u201d You laugh at his attempt to hide his shock at your comment and he tries to hide it further by dipping you down suddenly and whisking you back up. </p><p>You laugh more and push him away slightly so you can get your hair unstuck from your lipstick and back in order. You thank Rihanna for the wonderful bra that kept the ladies snugly in place during that move of his. Tony chuckles at you and helps dislodge a lock of hair from your fake eyelashes without pulling them off. Without skipping a beat he has you back in place in his arms, but this time a little closer than before. </p><p>\u201cSo if after three months I don\u2019t have you figured out, what has you so sure you have me figured out?\u201d Tony asks suddenly.</p><p>You pause and run your tongue over your lips, missing how Tony\u2019s eyes followed the movement with rapt attention. \u201cForgive me if this sounds too forward, Mr. Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026But you have a bit of a paper trail. You\u2019ve never been off the publicity radar and they don\u2019t really build super models and bottle girls and high class reporters like me. I mean, look at Ms. Potts, she\u2019s gorgeous. It\u2019s not exactly a secret that you hired me as her replacement because I\u2019m less distraction,\u201d you admit freely, the vodka finally catching up to you and making you a little loose lipped. </p><p>Tony cocked his head to the side and sucked his lips against his teeth in thought. You quirked an eye at his intense gaze and stopped letting him lead you along the dance floor, he stopped easily as if you had been leading him the entire time which you very might have been now that you thought about it. </p><p>\u201cI find you incredibly distracting,\u201d Tony admitted blinking rapidly at you in confusion. \u201cI find it distracting how you carry yourself with such a dominating confidence. I find it distracting that in three months of working with me you know my needs better than anyone ever has. I find it distracting that someone as stunning and bright as you lets herself get knocked down by snarky comments. I find it distracting that apparently you have 99 problems and haven\u2019t bothered to come to me with any of them.\u201d </p><p>You were acutely aware that the two of you were stood still in the middle of dancing couples, some of them had even stopped to watch you while the others simply stared as they danced past. But you ignored them in favor of the man in front of you. You licked your lips nervously and ran your hands down his suit jacket lapels to smooth them. You were too aware of the weight and warmth of his hands on your hips, his fingers digging into your flesh softly to stop you from escaping. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t come to people with problems that can\u2019t be fixed, Tony,\u201d you chuckled darkly, trying to gloss over his admission. </p><p>Tony pursed his lips and nodded and with a smooth step you were both moving again, your arms wrapped around his neck as his hands hadn\u2019t left your sides. </p><p>\u201cI think the world needs more women like you, Y/N. You\u2019re strong and you\u2019re confident, even when you\u2019re mentally beating yourself up. I wish you\u2019d be a little more take charge, but I guess that\u2019s just going to have to come with a position of authority,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cAre you firing me, Tony?\u201d you asked, stopping the dance once more. </p><p>\u201cAs my assistant? Yes. But that\u2019s because you\u2019ll be too busy heading the public relations team,\u201d Tony said simply, taking your hand and leading you off the dance floor and out of the way of the couples that had started subtly glaring at the two of you. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d you gasped and took the flute of champagne he offered you.</p><p>\u201cI filed the papers with Pep this morning. You\u2019ll get dinner with me tomorrow to discuss the details?\u201d </p><p>You took a shaky gulp and nodded. \u201cY-yeah. Yeah, I can do tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Tony nodded and smiled brilliantly. \u201cGreat. Maybe now that you aren\u2019t my assistant you\u2019d like to accompany me to a gala I have to go to on Saturday as my plus one. I\u2019d hate for the rumor mill to start saying my type is my assistants.\u201d </p><p>With a wink he was whisked away into another business conversation. You made your way back to the bar where you started and smiled as Natasha approached you from the shadows. </p><p>\u201cYou seem to be having a good night,\u201d she commented coyly. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, this is a pretty good party,\u201d you answer with a smile and watch Tony from across the rooftop, already planning what to wear on your upcoming date.</p>",

It was from your boss, Tony Stark, wondering where you were. You smiled softly and returned to your mirror where you replied a coat of your favorite shade of lipstick before throwing it in your little black clutch and headed up to the rooftop where this shindig was being thrown. You took a deep breath to steel your nerves and put your pleasant Stark assistant face on as the elevator opened up to the rooftop. You looked up from the entrance platform out on the sea of perfectly trimmed topiary and fairy lights. It had been a painstaking week of planning the soiree to every minute detail, Tony had given you free reign to take some of the burden off of Pepper\u2019s busy schedule. </p><p>You made your way down the stairs and headed straight for the bar, giving a little wave to Steve and Sam as you passed and quickly ordered yourself a martini and a shot of Svedka. Shooting back the shot quickly you winced at the rubbing alcohol like burn before chasing it with a swallow of martini, the dry vermouth not doing much to take the sensation away. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHey, sweet cheeks, getting good and party ready?\u201d the familiar voice had you plastering on your best smile before turning and facing him. Tony Stark stood in front of you in a navy blue suit with a silvery silk shirt underneath. The top few buttons were open, flashing a bit of chest hair and the soft glow from his arc reactor. His brown hair was gelled to a perfectly tousled mess and his black rimmed glasses were void of the rosy hue the lenses normally had to hide the red of his eyes from lack of sleep. </p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Stark,\u201d you responded stiffly, raising your glass to your painted lips once more. </p><p>Tony frowned and fiddled with the cuff links on his jacket. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s been three months now and every day I tell you to call me Tony.\u201d</p><p>Your smile falters for a moment before you nod in understanding. \u201cSure thing, boss,\u201d you tease, skirting around getting too informal with the man himself. He rolls his eyes, knowing what you were doing. \u201cAre there any important people here that I should be taking note of?\u201d You ask to distract him as you open your clutch to fish your phone out. No matter how tiny your purse was it never ceased to amaze you how your phone always got lost in them. </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand reached out and settled gently on yours. \u201cYou\u2019re off duty tonight, Y/N. Come dance with me.\u201d You opened your mouth to protest but he held his hand out. \u201cCome on, it\u2019ll show them I still have good taste.\u201d </p><p>You snorted inelegantly, but placed your hand in his none the less. Tony pulled you out onto the dance floor and even with your hand folded in his and your other arm draped around his neck you couldn\u2019t help but anxiously cast your eyes around and focus in on the women who did double takes every time they noticed who Tony Stark was bothering to dance with. You flushed and dipped your head slightly, your hair falling to hide your face as Tony spun you both slowly around the floor.</p><p>Tony pulled away from you a little to look at you properly and brushed the hair out of your face to tuck it behind your ear. \u201cI can\u2019t be that bad of a dancer,\u201d Tony teased, trying to lighten whatever mood had you suddenly downtrodden. </p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like everyone staring,\u201d you murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re just trying to figure out where I hide the super suit,\u201d Tony continued to joke.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re trying to figure out if I\u2019m going to be the next woman to try and tame Tony Stark. They\u2019re either feeling bad for me or brushing me off because I\u2019m very obviously not your type,\u201d you answer with a little more venom then you meant, it shocked you a little the ferociousness of it but it didn\u2019t seem to faze Tony in the slightest. </p><p>One of Tony\u2019s eyebrows raised and the corner of his mouth quirked up in a boyish smirk. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I had a type.\u201d </p><p>The tempo of the band had picked up, but Tony continued to move around the dance floor at his own pace. It was a such a Tony Stark thing, it didn\u2019t matter what everyone else around him was doing he was always going to do what he thinks is best regardless. </p><p>You laughed at what you assumed was his feigned ignorance. \u201cPlease, Tony. Look,<b> I have 99 problems and my curves ain\u2019t one</b>, but they obviously aren\u2019t your type. That\u2019s okay, everyone has a type.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s brows furrowed in contemplation and he simply hummed in understanding, his lips pursed slightly. You were about to apologize, afraid to have offended the man, when the cloudy look disappeared from his face and he retrained his laser vision to you. </p><p>\u201cWell, I can assume short aging men aren\u2019t your type. So maybe they\u2019re all pitying me,\u201d Tony shot at you. You narrowed your eyes, his tone came off as him trying a little too hard to be flippant. </p><p>\u201cShows what you know. Silver foxes are very much my thing.\u201d You laugh at his attempt to hide his shock at your comment and he tries to hide it further by dipping you down suddenly and whisking you back up. </p><p>You laugh more and push him away slightly so you can get your hair unstuck from your lipstick and back in order. You thank Rihanna for the wonderful bra that kept the ladies snugly in place during that move of his. Tony chuckles at you and helps dislodge a lock of hair from your fake eyelashes without pulling them off. Without skipping a beat he has you back in place in his arms, but this time a little closer than before. </p><p>\u201cSo if after three months I don\u2019t have you figured out, what has you so sure you have me figured out?\u201d Tony asks suddenly.</p><p>You pause and run your tongue over your lips, missing how Tony\u2019s eyes followed the movement with rapt attention. \u201cForgive me if this sounds too forward, Mr. Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026But you have a bit of a paper trail. You\u2019ve never been off the publicity radar and they don\u2019t really build super models and bottle girls and high class reporters like me. I mean, look at Ms. Potts, she\u2019s gorgeous. It\u2019s not exactly a secret that you hired me as her replacement because I\u2019m less distraction,\u201d you admit freely, the vodka finally catching up to you and making you a little loose lipped. </p><p>Tony cocked his head to the side and sucked his lips against his teeth in thought. You quirked an eye at his intense gaze and stopped letting him lead you along the dance floor, he stopped easily as if you had been leading him the entire time which you very might have been now that you thought about it. </p><p>\u201cI find you incredibly distracting,\u201d Tony admitted blinking rapidly at you in confusion. \u201cI find it distracting how you carry yourself with such a dominating confidence. I find it distracting that in three months of working with me you know my needs better than anyone ever has. I find it distracting that someone as stunning and bright as you lets herself get knocked down by snarky comments. I find it distracting that apparently you have 99 problems and haven\u2019t bothered to come to me with any of them.\u201d </p><p>You were acutely aware that the two of you were stood still in the middle of dancing couples, some of them had even stopped to watch you while the others simply stared as they danced past. But you ignored them in favor of the man in front of you. You licked your lips nervously and ran your hands down his suit jacket lapels to smooth them. You were too aware of the weight and warmth of his hands on your hips, his fingers digging into your flesh softly to stop you from escaping. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t come to people with problems that can\u2019t be fixed, Tony,\u201d you chuckled darkly, trying to gloss over his admission. </p><p>Tony pursed his lips and nodded and with a smooth step you were both moving again, your arms wrapped around his neck as his hands hadn\u2019t left your sides. </p><p>\u201cI think the world needs more women like you, Y/N. You\u2019re strong and you\u2019re confident, even when you\u2019re mentally beating yourself up. I wish you\u2019d be a little more take charge, but I guess that\u2019s just going to have to come with a position of authority,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cAre you firing me, Tony?\u201d you asked, stopping the dance once more. </p><p>\u201cAs my assistant? Yes. But that\u2019s because you\u2019ll be too busy heading the public relations team,\u201d Tony said simply, taking your hand and leading you off the dance floor and out of the way of the couples that had started subtly glaring at the two of you. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d you gasped and took the flute of champagne he offered you.</p><p>\u201cI filed the papers with Pep this morning. You\u2019ll get dinner with me tomorrow to discuss the details?\u201d </p><p>You took a shaky gulp and nodded. \u201cY-yeah. Yeah, I can do tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Tony nodded and smiled brilliantly. \u201cGreat. Maybe now that you aren\u2019t my assistant you\u2019d like to accompany me to a gala I have to go to on Saturday as my plus one. I\u2019d hate for the rumor mill to start saying my type is my assistants.\u201d </p><p>With a wink he was whisked away into another business conversation. You made your way back to the bar where you started and smiled as Natasha approached you from the shadows. </p><p>\u201cYou seem to be having a good night,\u201d she commented coyly. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, this is a pretty good party,\u201d you answer with a smile and watch Tony from across the rooftop, already planning what to wear on your upcoming date.</p>",
