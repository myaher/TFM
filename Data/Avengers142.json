But, it did \u2013 it always did. Battles had been won on the blood spilt from both friend and foe, each life lost a harsh weight that grew heavier and heavier throughout your life.</p><p>And then, came Loki\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>The fall of New York still haunted you. Months passed, life drifted on, uncaring and forgetful; new horrors, new concerns to focus on. But you, <i>you </i>could never forget.</p><p>Thor\u2019s search for Loki had brought him to Midgard, and you, the brothers\u2019 closest childhood confidante, had followed. That God of Mischief, to whom you had once promised your heart, loved and cherished and almost worshipped, <i>infuriated </i>you beyond belief now. His hunger for greatness, for a crown and people to subjugate, had overcome the memory of the sweet prince you had fallen in love with. There, where at last you witnessed Midgardian mortality, you saw Loki in a new light: <i>monster</i>, you recoiled, <i>snake, murderer\u2014</i></p><p><i>Laufeyson!</i></p><p>Where your heart ached for mankind\u2019s suffering, and loved them for their courage and tenacity, Loki had come to think them beneath him \u2013 and you hated him for it.</p><p>After returning to Asgard with him in chains, you resolved to never see his face again, to never take his name, to never even think of him. But Thor had different ideas.</p><p>Trailing behind Jane, with Lady Sif at your side, the three of you happened upon Thor in the corridors of the palace. The shock hit you at once, its crushing weight halting your steps and pushing the air out from your lungs. For there, standing beside him, was no one else, but <i>Loki</i>.</p><p>He was supposed to rot in his cell. Far from the world, imprisoned so he could not be unleashed and wreak havoc once more. Had he escaped, you thought. But then why was Thor not detaining him immediately?</p><p>You watched from afar as Jane and Sif walked on, the mortal woman\u2019s strides determined, each footfall heavy with fury. Suddenly, her fist lashed out. The punch landed, its collision with Loki\u2019s face leaving you all stunned. And, though you were dazed, you found yourself snickering.</p><p>\u201cThat was for New York,\u201d Jane bit out. She glowered up at the god.</p><p>It was no surprise that the god of mischief answered with a smile, a grin that would have once excited you, made your heart flutter. No, not <i>once..</i>.</p><p>Despite yourself, you felt your heart flutter again.</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d he said. You hadn\u2019t heard his voice in so long. It was still smooth, like velvet and silk, a soft caress that you felt even from where you stood.</p><p>His gaze strayed, in curiosity shifting to the lone figure he spied from the corner of his eyes \u2013 and he froze. Much to your displeasure, your eyes locked. In a moment his smile had waned. He blinked, and he blinked again, again and again and again, as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe he was seeing you. As if you were a ghost, an apparition\u2026 a vision he had conjured up in his cell far too often\u2026 who now walked the halls, whole, solid, <i>real</i>.</p><p>The crack of your knuckles was almost too loud in the quiet that befell the hall as you clenched your hands. You glared at him; but could not find the courage to approach \u2013 to shout at him, to curse him, to hit him.</p><p>Never would you admit it, but you didn\u2019t just hate him for his tyranny, for his blind hunger for power\u2026 you hated him, <i>most</i>, for breaking your heart. How long had you mourned his fall from the Bifrost, before discovering he had not died? Before realising he had not, and would not, return for you. That he chose not to.</p><p>It dawned on you in those minutes as the tense atmosphere in the hall thickened, that this was why Thor had not asked for your help against the Dark Elves. Thor, ever an attentive friend, did not want Loki anywhere near you. Because, to subject you to Loki\u2019s presence, when your heart was not yet mended, would be <i>torture</i>.</p><p>When Thor followed Loki\u2019s gaze, feeling the shift in the air, he saw you. The Crown Prince lowered his face, both a bow in greeting, and an attempt to hide his guilt, as you returned the gesture, unable to shake the stiffness from your form. Then, in a hurry, you left the hall, striding through its labyrinths to your chambers far from the group \u2013 far from <i>him</i>.</p><p>As the doors slammed shut behind you, the groan of the ancient wood echoing your ire, you hissed, \u201cI hope that snake dies.\u201d</p><p>And he did.</p><p>There was a weight on Thor\u2019s shoulders that far outweighed what burdens he had carried in his past when he returned after the war. He pulled you close, silent for what felt like eons, face buried so tight against your neck that you felt the touch of his tears as if they were a part of your own skin.</p><p>\u201cLoki is gone, [Y/N],\u201d he at last whispered, hesitant, broken. \u201cHe protected me. And he\u2026 he <i>died</i>.\u201d</p><p>The relief you had expected to feel did not come. He was dead, you told yourself, as your feet carried you to a destination you were not quite aware of, he could no longer hurt others, could no longer cause mischief, could no longer plot and scheme and stab those who loved him in the back\u2014</p><p>But, no, you did not feel at ease.</p><p>Instead, you found yourself in Loki\u2019s old chambers, sinking to the floor of the balcony, where his and your childhood drawings still remained. And, you cried. Mourning him once had been difficult enough; twice was crushing, twice was <i>cruel</i>.</p><p>Despite Loki\u2019s faults, he was loved. He had always been loved; by Frigga; by Thor. And, gods, you had loved him too.</p><p>Perhaps, while tracing the drawing of you and him from eons passed, as children holding hands and smiling, you realised you <i>still love him</i>\u2026 and, having redeemed himself, you <i>always would</i>.</p><p>With Thor you mourned Loki. But, then, Thor was gone, disappeared to Midgard, and then to find answers to questions you were not even aware of. Loneliness bit deep. Then, there was a shift in the All-Father. He became softer, gentler, tender in his attentions, as if he were your own father. He grieved with you, and there was a sorrow you did not often see in the militant king that spoke, silently, of a broken heart.</p><p>He would often send you gifts, fruits and meats, silks among shield and swords, and books to keep you company when you were sad. \u00a0</p><p>It surprised you. The king had never been quite so attentive before.</p><p>But, you did not know. It was not <i>Odin</i>.</p><p>It was Loki.</p><p>From his throne, Loki watched beneath his mask of magic, noting the pull of facial muscles that showed each emotion that flickered over your features, hands clenching and unclenching around his armrests, restless in his desire to hold you, to tell you he was alive, to apologise and tell you he loved you more than anything else in existence.</p><p>Your eyes met. And there was the unmistakeable glint of tears in the king\u2019s unwounded eye.</p><p><i>You cannot let [Y/N] go</i>, Loki thought. He struggled to keep the magic up in a moment of distress. <i>Not again. If I do, I\u2019ll lose [her/him/them], </i>forever<i>.</i></p><p>You smiled, inclined your head in respect, and returned to your dinner, turning to the warrior beside you to resume your conversation.</p><p><i>Fool!</i> Loki might have slammed his sceptre onto the marble floor if he was not accustomed to reining in his emotions. <i>I </i>have <i>lost [her/him/them]. I lost [Y/N] long ago. There is nothing I can do. [She/He/They] [respects/respect] you again after the staged sacrifice. If I showed myself to [her/him/them] now, I will return to a villain in [her/his/their] eyes. There is nothing I can do now, not as [her/his/their] beloved.</i></p><p>But, as Odin, as the All-Father, he could watch over you, protect you, make sure you were content and happy. He treated you as Odin might have, had you been his own. It was the only way Loki could be near you; be kind to atone for his sins.</p><p>And it hurt him, to see you move on, to not be able to confess his feelings. Remaining dead in your eyes when he was alive and in love was <i>excruciating</i>. But, perhaps, it was his most fitting punishment, for all that he had done.</p><p>If, even behind an illusion, Loki could make you smile, see you safe, then maybe he <i>could </i>finally be content after all.</p><hr><p><b><sub>will probably edit. stay tuned. :)</sub></b> </p>",

Months passed, life drifted on, uncaring and forgetful; new horrors, new concerns to focus on. But you, <i>you </i>could never forget.</p><p>Thor\u2019s search for Loki had brought him to Midgard, and you, the brothers\u2019 closest childhood confidante, had followed. That God of Mischief, to whom you had once promised your heart, loved and cherished and almost worshipped, <i>infuriated </i>you beyond belief now. His hunger for greatness, for a crown and people to subjugate, had overcome the memory of the sweet prince you had fallen in love with. There, where at last you witnessed Midgardian mortality, you saw Loki in a new light: <i>monster</i>, you recoiled, <i>snake, murderer\u2014</i></p><p><i>Laufeyson!</i></p><p>Where your heart ached for mankind\u2019s suffering, and loved them for their courage and tenacity, Loki had come to think them beneath him \u2013 and you hated him for it.</p><p>After returning to Asgard with him in chains, you resolved to never see his face again, to never take his name, to never even think of him. But Thor had different ideas.</p><p>Trailing behind Jane, with Lady Sif at your side, the three of you happened upon Thor in the corridors of the palace. The shock hit you at once, its crushing weight halting your steps and pushing the air out from your lungs. For there, standing beside him, was no one else, but <i>Loki</i>.</p><p>He was supposed to rot in his cell. Far from the world, imprisoned so he could not be unleashed and wreak havoc once more. Had he escaped, you thought. But then why was Thor not detaining him immediately?</p><p>You watched from afar as Jane and Sif walked on, the mortal woman\u2019s strides determined, each footfall heavy with fury. Suddenly, her fist lashed out. The punch landed, its collision with Loki\u2019s face leaving you all stunned. And, though you were dazed, you found yourself snickering.</p><p>\u201cThat was for New York,\u201d Jane bit out. She glowered up at the god.</p><p>It was no surprise that the god of mischief answered with a smile, a grin that would have once excited you, made your heart flutter. No, not <i>once..</i>.</p><p>Despite yourself, you felt your heart flutter again.</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d he said. You hadn\u2019t heard his voice in so long. It was still smooth, like velvet and silk, a soft caress that you felt even from where you stood.</p><p>His gaze strayed, in curiosity shifting to the lone figure he spied from the corner of his eyes \u2013 and he froze. Much to your displeasure, your eyes locked. In a moment his smile had waned. He blinked, and he blinked again, again and again and again, as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe he was seeing you. As if you were a ghost, an apparition\u2026 a vision he had conjured up in his cell far too often\u2026 who now walked the halls, whole, solid, <i>real</i>.</p><p>The crack of your knuckles was almost too loud in the quiet that befell the hall as you clenched your hands. You glared at him; but could not find the courage to approach \u2013 to shout at him, to curse him, to hit him.</p><p>Never would you admit it, but you didn\u2019t just hate him for his tyranny, for his blind hunger for power\u2026 you hated him, <i>most</i>, for breaking your heart. How long had you mourned his fall from the Bifrost, before discovering he had not died? Before realising he had not, and would not, return for you. That he chose not to.</p><p>It dawned on you in those minutes as the tense atmosphere in the hall thickened, that this was why Thor had not asked for your help against the Dark Elves. Thor, ever an attentive friend, did not want Loki anywhere near you. Because, to subject you to Loki\u2019s presence, when your heart was not yet mended, would be <i>torture</i>.</p><p>When Thor followed Loki\u2019s gaze, feeling the shift in the air, he saw you. The Crown Prince lowered his face, both a bow in greeting, and an attempt to hide his guilt, as you returned the gesture, unable to shake the stiffness from your form. Then, in a hurry, you left the hall, striding through its labyrinths to your chambers far from the group \u2013 far from <i>him</i>.</p><p>As the doors slammed shut behind you, the groan of the ancient wood echoing your ire, you hissed, \u201cI hope that snake dies.\u201d</p><p>And he did.</p><p>There was a weight on Thor\u2019s shoulders that far outweighed what burdens he had carried in his past when he returned after the war. He pulled you close, silent for what felt like eons, face buried so tight against your neck that you felt the touch of his tears as if they were a part of your own skin.</p><p>\u201cLoki is gone, [Y/N],\u201d he at last whispered, hesitant, broken. \u201cHe protected me. And he\u2026 he <i>died</i>.\u201d</p><p>The relief you had expected to feel did not come. He was dead, you told yourself, as your feet carried you to a destination you were not quite aware of, he could no longer hurt others, could no longer cause mischief, could no longer plot and scheme and stab those who loved him in the back\u2014</p><p>But, no, you did not feel at ease.</p><p>Instead, you found yourself in Loki\u2019s old chambers, sinking to the floor of the balcony, where his and your childhood drawings still remained. And, you cried. Mourning him once had been difficult enough; twice was crushing, twice was <i>cruel</i>.</p><p>Despite Loki\u2019s faults, he was loved. He had always been loved; by Frigga; by Thor. And, gods, you had loved him too.</p><p>Perhaps, while tracing the drawing of you and him from eons passed, as children holding hands and smiling, you realised you <i>still love him</i>\u2026 and, having redeemed himself, you <i>always would</i>.</p><p>With Thor you mourned Loki. But, then, Thor was gone, disappeared to Midgard, and then to find answers to questions you were not even aware of. Loneliness bit deep. Then, there was a shift in the All-Father. He became softer, gentler, tender in his attentions, as if he were your own father. He grieved with you, and there was a sorrow you did not often see in the militant king that spoke, silently, of a broken heart.</p><p>He would often send you gifts, fruits and meats, silks among shield and swords, and books to keep you company when you were sad. \u00a0</p><p>It surprised you. The king had never been quite so attentive before.</p><p>But, you did not know. It was not <i>Odin</i>.</p><p>It was Loki.</p><p>From his throne, Loki watched beneath his mask of magic, noting the pull of facial muscles that showed each emotion that flickered over your features, hands clenching and unclenching around his armrests, restless in his desire to hold you, to tell you he was alive, to apologise and tell you he loved you more than anything else in existence.</p><p>Your eyes met. And there was the unmistakeable glint of tears in the king\u2019s unwounded eye.</p><p><i>You cannot let [Y/N] go</i>, Loki thought. He struggled to keep the magic up in a moment of distress. <i>Not again. If I do, I\u2019ll lose [her/him/them], </i>forever<i>.</i></p><p>You smiled, inclined your head in respect, and returned to your dinner, turning to the warrior beside you to resume your conversation.</p><p><i>Fool!</i> Loki might have slammed his sceptre onto the marble floor if he was not accustomed to reining in his emotions. <i>I </i>have <i>lost [her/him/them]. I lost [Y/N] long ago. There is nothing I can do. [She/He/They] [respects/respect] you again after the staged sacrifice.

Remaining dead in your eyes when he was alive and in love was <i>excruciating</i>. But, perhaps, it was his most fitting punishment, for all that he had done.</p><p>If, even behind an illusion, Loki could make you smile, see you safe, then maybe he <i>could </i>finally be content after all.</p><hr><p><b><sub>will probably edit. stay tuned. :)</sub></b> </p>",

Hastily you retrieved the weapons assigned to you and fit them into their holsters. Desperately you tried to regulate your breathing. Your stomach protested. Despite all the training, and the trust S.H.I.E.L.D. had bestowed upon your competence, you felt dread gnawing at your insides. Whispers, harsh and relentless, promised from the back of your head that you would fail \u2013 your first mission would end in tragedy. No matter how hard you tried to suppress them, they only grew stronger.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid,\u201d came a voice, like velvet, from the doorway.</p><p>There she stood, red hair ablaze in the sunlight: The Black Widow. Never before had you seen her this close. Having caught only glimpses of her from afar, and heard tales of her lethality, you were stunned to find that \u2013 something no one had told you \u2013 she was <i>beautiful</i>.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d As she asked the question, in a voice soft and yet strong, the corners of her lips arched upward.</p><p>\u201cY\u2014Yeah.\u201d The fumble of your voice caused her smirk to deepen. Cursing yourself intensely, you focused on preparing your weapons for the oncoming mission.</p><p>She approached you; the small heels of her shoes sounded like power against the metal floor. Once she had her guns and her gadgets, she turned to you and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>You glanced at her, fleetingly. Loading her gun, she began to leave. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>Barely above a whisper, you replied, \u201cBye\u2026\u201d</p><p>The sun set and plunged Russia into darkness. Hours had dragged by; which you spent in silence; within an armoured car alongside your team.</p><p>The car stopped. It was in the middle of nowhere, and yet you still had to walk the rest of the way. The mission was strictly <i>quiet</i>. The assassination of Ivan Petrov, one of Russia\u2019s most ruthless black market mobsters, was like dancing with danger \u2013 a dance that surely invited death. As you trudged through the snow, eyes squinted in the heavy snowfall, a scarf wrapped tight around your neck most of your face, the weight of your weapons troubled you; they dragged you down, to an early grave.</p><p>In the snow, standing large and proud was Petrov\u2019s holiday home. Even from afar you could tell it was <i>opulent</i> \u2013 a snobbish reminder of his immense wealth.</p><p>Your team\u2019s assignment was to neutralise the ground through immobilising the enemy\u2019s security. \u201cProtect Agent Romanoff,\u201d Fury had said. \u201cMake sure she gets out.\u201d</p><p>Petrov and his beating heart were at the mercy of The Widow.</p><p>Snow covered the immaculate garden\u2019s bush-art; no doubt the artistic intention. Clad in snow-white, your team darted through the garden, hiding behind the white bushes, swimming through the night\u2019s shadows; searching with your guns for the private security.</p><p>The men stood monstrously large; but not even Hercules could stop a bullet. The silencers softened each gunshot. The bullets ripped through the air; piercing flesh. There was a heaviness in your chest when the men crumpled to the ground. Shooting a gun was profoundly different when it was aimed at a living, breathing being; was it right to hold another\u2019s life in your hands?</p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by gunshots. The mansion came alive. \u00a0</p><p>Your team leader, Mike, gestured for you all to move inside. Footsteps covered the snow. From within, harsh sounds of shooting filled the air. Men descended the grand staircase as if out of nowhere. Shouts, Russian curses, were soon followed by gunshots. No longer able to contemplate whether it was right or wrong to take a life, you raised your gun and, taking aim, pulled the trigger.</p><p>The sound invaded your ears.</p><p>The bullet disappeared into his forehead.</p><p>\u201cFind cover!\u201d Mike grabbed your arm and pulled you behind a wall.</p><p>The symphony of gunshots continued; muffled by the blood roaring in your ears. A nearby vase shattered as a bullet flew through the wall past you. Glancing towards the bullet hole, heart sinking in horror, you realised just how close it was from hitting your head.</p><p>Shocked, you gripped your firearm to your chest and pushed yourself back against the wall. Breaths fell from your lips in heavy pants. In the rain of bullets fell the bodies of the unfortunate. Before you could snap out of your daze and stop him, Mike ran from cover with a shout. Down went your enemies, falling at the mercy (or lack thereof) of your team. Mikes yelling sounded distant.</p><p>Then, suddenly, it all stopped.</p><p>The scream came next. Glancing past the corner of the wall, you realised what had happened. Among the fallen lay Mike; already gone; his once warm brown eyes staring, emptily, at the ceiling. Blood covered his glistening dark skin. Leaning over him was Luke: Mike\u2019s best friend. His wails broke your heart.</p><p>Jane, a woman you often sparred with, crouched down beside the body and placed her fingers \u2013 hesitantly, as if fearing the inevitable result \u2013 at Mike\u2019s throat.</p><p>Everyone knew the truth. And yet, Jane\u2019s face fell, and she shook her head disappointedly.</p><p>It was as if you felt numb and yet restless. Your gun began to slip from your fingers; you did not bother to tighten your grip. It fell to your lap. It was in that moment, as Mike\u2019s body blurred in your tear-filled eyes, that you realised just how fleeting life was; how it felt to witness a comrade die.</p><p>A strange bitterness rose in your mouth. <i>This is my life now</i>, you thought. Luke sobbed, rocking Mike back and forth in his arms. <i>Killing\u2026 and waiting to die.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvz4mQIO1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"/></figure><p>It was said that Ivan Petrov was assassinated as if by a vengeful God (a Goddess); swiftly, and without mercy. The chaos that followed afterward, those who fell among its storm of bullets, went unmentioned.<br/></p><p>That mission was your past \u2013 having occurred several months ago. However, Mike\u2019s funeral still haunted your mind. While training with him, you had never known that he had a family: a husband and a little daughter. Death had not frightened you before, and you thought it never would. But, after that night it began to follow you like a shadow.</p><p>It was raining the day you accompanied Luke to Mike\u2019s grave. He and Mike had been brothers: not by blood, but by heart. And in their last moment together, Mike had been Luke\u2019s shield.</p><p>Luke dreamt often that he took the bullets that had been meant for him, and that after he said goodbye to his brother, Mike would return home to his family and raise his daughter. When he woke, he would bury his face in his pillow, and <i>scream</i>. The screams would turn to wails.</p><p>As you both stood before Mike\u2019s gravestone, his daughter\u2019s letters soaked and ruined in the rain, you held Luke\u2019s hand and squeezed it in reassurance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re like pawns, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>His words dazed you. He had barely spoken since Mike\u2019s death. It was as if his voice disappeared with Mike\u2019s spirit. As the rain fell like tears around you, Luke turned towards you with tears in his own eyes, a frown creased into his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the Avengers,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even special agents. We\u2019re<i> disposable</i>. And they will never weep for us.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s words plagued you for a long time. It whispered from the back of your mind. They were drowned only once, by screams, on the day he died; your arms were painted with his blood as he took his last breath. Only you and your team wept for him. Nick Fury impassively addressed his death; he had seen so much death, and sent so many into destruction, that it was just another soldier sacrificing their life for their country. It was just another soldier sacrificing their lives for the powerful.</p><p>It was just <i>another </i>name.</p><p>Your sorrow turned to rage. And you frequently unleashed it in training. You grew deadlier. You were a storm, hungry for the wicked. Concern turned to fear. Your team remained faithful and constantly at your side. Jane no longer sparred with you \u2013 she was not ashamed to admit she found you intimidating in the training room \u2013 but instead would often sleep-over at your apartment and offer you whatever support you required.</p><p>Eventually, you gained the attention of your superiors; and, the eye of a certain red-haired assassin.</p><p>In her mind, she thought of the nervous recruit she had once reassured before a mission. But who she saw now barely reminded her of that person.</p><p>She watched you fight. There was a raw brutality in your moves. At first, the assassin felt impressed. Until, Clint wondered aloud, \u201cWhat tragedy did [he/she/they] go through to end up like that?\u201d</p><p>The Widow watched you more carefully with Clint\u2019s words in her mind; noticing the gloom in your eyes, the heaviness at your shoulders.</p><p><i>Like us?</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvzf8GxJ1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"/></figure><p>Classic rock played in the background amongst gentle chatter. You rattled the ice cubes in your glass, watching them drown in amber liquid.<br/></p><p>You did not often go to the bar, but tonight you were feeling particularly in need of a drink \u2013 a strong one.</p><p>Director Fury had offered you a promotion. He wanted you to be a special agent. He had asked you <i>in person</i>. Though it was more of an order, you had dared to refuse.</p><p>Mike and Luke died unhonoured, bleeding for their country in the shadows; you would never forget that, or them. If you had to remain in the shadows to notice and respect your peers, then you gladly would.</p><p>As your surroundings became gradually blurrier and blurrier, a red-headed woman approached you at the counter. She went unnoticed as she took the seat by your side, a smirk at her lips when she realised the extent of your intoxication.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid.\u201d</p><p>Even in a drunken haze, your mind registered her voice, her words. A rapid rhythm overcame your heart and, although you were curious as to why<i> the Black Widow </i>was at your side at a bar, you intently focused your eyes on your drink. The ice cubes were melting \u2013 like your brain.</p><p>\u201cI know you remember me.\u201d Her smirk was yet to leave her lips.</p><p>The words slipped from your tongue before you could stop them. \u201cIt would be impossible not to.\u201d</p><p><i>Red hair in the shadows: crimson like the blood of Ivan Petrov.</i> <i>Carnage in her beautiful eyes.</i></p><p>\u201cI could say the same about you.\u201d From your peripheral vision you saw her slide a file towards you.

However, your file is extraordinarily impressive, and he would like you to know that the offer is still available. He just wants you to take some time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d Without even looking at her, you pushed the file away from you. \u201cThe answer is still no. It will always be no.\u201d</p><p>Silence was expected; anything else would have been a surprise to you. Assuming that the Avenger would leave, you ordered another drink and returned your attention to numbing your soul.</p><p>However, she did not leave. And, after a pause in which she watched you with her sharp, dissecting eyes, she spoke one simple word.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The unexpected outcome left you in a stupor; though, even if it hadn\u2019t, your drunken mind would still be incompetent at forming an answer. Finally, you turned towards her, your wide eyes merely staring straight back. She was still scrutinising you, taking you apart and putting you back together; the thought of having no privacy, of being sifted through, left a bitter taste in your mouth.</p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re not the Avengers.\u201d</i></p><p>Luke\u2019s voice rose through the haze in your mind.<i> </i>Resentment burned in you as you stared into her eyes, the same eyes you feared that night when you had watched her walk past fallen bodies with only the trace of murder in her soul.</p><p><i>\u201cAnd they will never weep for us.\u201d</i></p><p>Your intoxication provided a courage you could never have mustered before, in the face of an <i>assassin</i>, of someone far more important than you could ever be. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like you,\u201d you almost spat.</p><p>The shock, and traces of distress in her eyes offered a jolt of guilt in you; but your tongue was like lead, unable to move, unable to apologise. And you did not want to. <i>They</i> never apologised. They never noticed people like you \u2013 people like Mike and Luke. The pawns would forever be unimportant to them, unworthy of notice.</p><p>Knocking back the remainder of your liquor, you gathered your belongings and trudged out of the bar. Into the embrace of the night; where no one would see your tears. Where no one in the world cared.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvzuwmkC1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"/></figure><p>It was the first time you were assigned to a mission with <i>them</i>: The Avengers. You had your suspicions that Fury was trying to tempt you to accept his promotion. You refused to even meet his eye during briefing.<br/></p><p>The <i>heroes</i> barely noticed your troop, as was expected. Once, you would have been as star-struck as your peers were in that moment. But all you felt now was sick.</p><p>Until <i>he</i> approached you. Agent Barton was as much a master assassin as The Widow was; but he was also a sarcastic jester. He held a mug each in his hands, filled to the brim with coffee, spilling <i>none</i> as he sat beside you. The frown of confusion on your face was instantaneous, and, no matter how hard you tried, it would not retreat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he greeted you lightly.</p><p>You watched him cautiously. \u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant some coffee?\u201d</p><p>A moment transpired. Too shocked to speak, you could only stare; but a bubble of laughter began to brew inside of you. You had assumed both mugs were for himself. It was not a farfetched assumption: many of you had witnessed him drink coffee straight from the coffee pot \u2013 on <i>frequent </i>occasions<i>.</i></p><p>\u201cNo one wants to drink coffee as black as your soul, Clint.\u201d It was her, jabbing her friend from where she stood \u2013 with<i> the Captain </i>himself.</p><p>Your smile was small; but did not go unnoticed by The Widow. There was a glint in her eyes as she turned away.</p><p>\u201cHardy-har-har.\u201d Clint glared good-naturedly in her direction before swiftly downing his coffee. Your frown returned; he did not flinch in the least from the bitterness.</p><p>To be honest, you were impressed.</p><p>It was then you realised the lower-ranked troops were not being ignored. It was typical for the low ranks to be brushed aside. But, as you glanced around, you noticed Captain Rogers had left Agent Romanoff\u2019s side and was now conversing with six soldiers, smiling as he recalled his days as one of them during the war. The \u201cGreat\u201d Tony Stark was taking selfies with a group of your acquaintances, a trace of grief in his eyes when he saw some of them raising the peace sign.</p><p>When your gaze found hers, you found her smiling \u2013 directly at you. Her arm felt warm when she came to sit \u2013 closely \u2013 beside you.</p><p>Guilt gnawed at your insides.</p><p>\u201cYou are all important.\u201d Her eyes were once more peering into your soul, but not selfishly nor carelessly; but with a tenderness that startled you. \u201cEvery single one of you. You have each other, but now you have us too. I talked to them\u2014\u201d she nodded her head towards her fellow Avengers\u2014 \u201cand we realised that we <i>have </i>been taking you all for granted. And we are <i>sincerely </i>sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>She was <i>beautiful</i>, but you realised, though she often smothered it, that her soul was what made her a so breath-taking. Despite the physical and mental scars, and the blood on her hands\u2026 she remained <i>kind</i>.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2013 about your friends. Michael and Luke were heroes. The bravest I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>There was a sorrow in her eyes, a deep understanding.</p><p><i>\u201cThey will never weep for us.\u201d</i></p><p>You smiled sadly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d</p><p>She understood, she was wise. You were apologising for something else. And she smiled back.</p><p><i>Yes, Luke, they will.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzw094Vtn1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"/></figure><p>You grunted, collapsing against the wall. Blood seeped out of your shoulder wound, trickling between your fingers. Breath heaving, unsteady and faltering alongside your heartbeat, you listened carefully for her footsteps.<br/></p><p>The assassin drew nearer, her deadly heels clicking against the floorboards. Better there than in your shoulder.</p><p>Gripping your shoulder tighter, you lifted your gun with your other hand, waiting\u2026 waiting\u2026 waiting\u2014</p><p>\u201c<i>Nat,\u201d </i>you whispered softly, closing your eyes. \u201c<i>Nat\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</i></p><p>From beyond the wall where you were leaning, she sneered, lifting her own gun.</p><p><i>It\u2019s now or never.</i></p><p>Abruptly, you got to your feet and jumped out from behind the wall, aiming your gun at her head. You saw her smirk, noticed her gun rising. Both triggers were pulled at the same time, the <i>bang</i>s echoing within the walls. As you fell, as if in slow motion, crying from the pain, you saw the droplets of blood spurt from the red hole in her forehead; watched her fall backwards along with you.</p><p>Your eyelids grew heavier. Darkness washed over the white ceiling. As you slipped away, her name rose to your lips, thrown out among the fading of your mind.</p><p>\u201c<i>Nat.</i>\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzw0rpBgd1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"/></figure><p><i>\u201cWakey wakey, eggs and bakey.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d There was a throbbing ache spread throughout your body as you rose from the blackness of oblivion, blinking the grogginess from your eyes. A face loomed above you, smiling. Your heart leapt into your throat and you gave a small cry, startling the person. They stumbled back.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to stand too close.\u201d You recognised the dry and unimpressed voice: Tony Stark.</p><p>Continuing to blink as you returned to reality, you turned your head to gather your surroundings. The med-bay walls were far too recognisable, startlingly white. Gathered within the room was Clint, who you realised had been the one leaning over you, and Mr Stark. The latter was scrutinising the medical machines, making you fear for your life.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d you managed to say through your aching throat.</p><p>\u201cYou took her down, [Y/N],\u201d Clint replied, looking grim. \u201cBut you got hurt. Stab to the shoulder, bullet in the chest. Nowhere near your heart, thank god. You must have shot first; she most likely panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were nearby.\u201d Clint took your hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. You smiled; you needed it.</p><p>The door opened, but it was not in your range of vision. Footfalls grew closer to your bed, a breathless laughter approaching you. Tears welled in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou came for me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Natasha reached your side and immediately took your hand. You were surprised to see the glint of tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014 Of course I did.\u201d She lifted your hand to her lips, pressing a gentle kiss to your skin.</p><p>Her name had been at your lips in the chaos of your fight; a prayer; your hope. You remembered thinking that if you passed, you would do so with her in your thoughts, so you could die happy.</p><p>Your heart pattered wildly when she continued to hold your hand, a determination in her eyes that refused to let you go.</p><p>Even when she finally released her physical hold on you, she did not leave your side. Between missions she was always there, a selfless support that kept you afloat in a tumultuous ocean. Her calculating gaze watched you every second, either to determine what you required in order to swiftly recover, or simply to admire the determination etched across your face, the captivating way you smiled through the pain \u2013 and oh, what a smile you had.</p><p>Natasha held your hand every night before you went to sleep, promising you she was there at your side, silently vowing no one would hurt you again.</p><p>Praying to whomever ruled the skies that <i>no one would take you from her</i>. And in those moments, when you slipped into your sea of dreams, when she held her fingers to your throat in fear that you were gone, she tightened her grip on your hand and cried.</p><p><i>Love is for children. </i>But her heart would not stop aching, <i>pining</i> for you. She could not lose you, not to death, not even to life. <i>Love is for children, Natalia</i>.</p><p>Maybe, she thought, it wasn\u2019t love. Not the typical romantic emotion a living being would feel, but something <i>so much more</i>, something heavenly, perhaps even hellish \u2013 something <i>ethereal</i>.</p><p>As The Widow lifted your hand and kissed your knuckles, she finally consented to the truth of the matter: you had stolen her heart; or at least what was left of it.</p><p>And beneath your closed eyelids, you dreamt of her, red hair ablaze beneath the sunlight, smiling like an angel. In your sleep, you whispered her name.</p><p>\u201c<i>Natalia</i>.\u201d</p><hr><p><b><sub>will probably edit. stay tuned. :)</sub></b></p>",

Hastily you retrieved the weapons assigned to you and fit them into their holsters. Desperately you tried to regulate your breathing. Your stomach protested. Despite all the training, and the trust S.H.I.E.L.D. had bestowed upon your competence, you felt dread gnawing at your insides. Whispers, harsh and relentless, promised from the back of your head that you would fail \u2013 your first mission would end in tragedy. No matter how hard you tried to suppress them, they only grew stronger.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid,\u201d came a voice, like velvet, from the doorway.</p><p>There she stood, red hair ablaze in the sunlight: The Black Widow. Never before had you seen her this close. Having caught only glimpses of her from afar, and heard tales of her lethality, you were stunned to find that \u2013 something no one had told you \u2013 she was <i>beautiful</i>.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d As she asked the question, in a voice soft and yet strong, the corners of her lips arched upward.</p><p>\u201cY\u2014Yeah.\u201d The fumble of your voice caused her smirk to deepen. Cursing yourself intensely, you focused on preparing your weapons for the oncoming mission.</p><p>She approached you; the small heels of her shoes sounded like power against the metal floor. Once she had her guns and her gadgets, she turned to you and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>You glanced at her, fleetingly. Loading her gun, she began to leave. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>Barely above a whisper, you replied, \u201cBye\u2026\u201d</p><p>The sun set and plunged Russia into darkness. Hours had dragged by; which you spent in silence; within an armoured car alongside your team.</p><p>The car stopped. It was in the middle of nowhere, and yet you still had to walk the rest of the way. The mission was strictly <i>quiet</i>. The assassination of Ivan Petrov, one of Russia\u2019s most ruthless black market mobsters, was like dancing with danger \u2013 a dance that surely invited death. As you trudged through the snow, eyes squinted in the heavy snowfall, a scarf wrapped tight around your neck most of your face, the weight of your weapons troubled you; they dragged you down, to an early grave.</p><p>In the snow, standing large and proud was Petrov\u2019s holiday home. Even from afar you could tell it was <i>opulent</i> \u2013 a snobbish reminder of his immense wealth.</p><p>Your team\u2019s assignment was to neutralise the ground through immobilising the enemy\u2019s security. \u201cProtect Agent Romanoff,\u201d Fury had said. \u201cMake sure she gets out.\u201d</p><p>Petrov and his beating heart were at the mercy of The Widow.</p><p>Snow covered the immaculate garden\u2019s bush-art; no doubt the artistic intention. Clad in snow-white, your team darted through the garden, hiding behind the white bushes, swimming through the night\u2019s shadows; searching with your guns for the private security.</p><p>The men stood monstrously large; but not even Hercules could stop a bullet. The silencers softened each gunshot. The bullets ripped through the air; piercing flesh. There was a heaviness in your chest when the men crumpled to the ground. Shooting a gun was profoundly different when it was aimed at a living, breathing being; was it right to hold another\u2019s life in your hands?</p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by gunshots. The mansion came alive. \u00a0</p><p>Your team leader, Mike, gestured for you all to move inside. Footsteps covered the snow. From within, harsh sounds of shooting filled the air. Men descended the grand staircase as if out of nowhere. Shouts, Russian curses, were soon followed by gunshots. No longer able to contemplate whether it was right or wrong to take a life, you raised your gun and, taking aim, pulled the trigger.</p><p>The sound invaded your ears.</p><p>The bullet disappeared into his forehead.</p><p>\u201cFind cover!\u201d Mike grabbed your arm and pulled you behind a wall.</p><p>The symphony of gunshots continued; muffled by the blood roaring in your ears. A nearby vase shattered as a bullet flew through the wall past you. Glancing towards the bullet hole, heart sinking in horror, you realised just how close it was from hitting your head.</p><p>Shocked, you gripped your firearm to your chest and pushed yourself back against the wall. Breaths fell from your lips in heavy pants. In the rain of bullets fell the bodies of the unfortunate. Before you could snap out of your daze and stop him, Mike ran from cover with a shout. Down went your enemies, falling at the mercy (or lack thereof) of your team. Mikes yelling sounded distant.</p><p>Then, suddenly, it all stopped.</p><p>The scream came next. Glancing past the corner of the wall, you realised what had happened. Among the fallen lay Mike; already gone; his once warm brown eyes staring, emptily, at the ceiling. Blood covered his glistening dark skin. Leaning over him was Luke: Mike\u2019s best friend. His wails broke your heart.</p><p>Jane, a woman you often sparred with, crouched down beside the body and placed her fingers \u2013 hesitantly, as if fearing the inevitable result \u2013 at Mike\u2019s throat.</p><p>Everyone knew the truth. And yet, Jane\u2019s face fell, and she shook her head disappointedly.</p><p>It was as if you felt numb and yet restless. Your gun began to slip from your fingers; you did not bother to tighten your grip. It fell to your lap. It was in that moment, as Mike\u2019s body blurred in your tear-filled eyes, that you realised just how fleeting life was; how it felt to witness a comrade die.</p><p>A strange bitterness rose in your mouth. <i>This is my life now</i>, you thought. Luke sobbed, rocking Mike back and forth in his arms. <i>Killing\u2026 and waiting to die.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvz4mQIO1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"></figure><p>It was said that Ivan Petrov was assassinated as if by a vengeful God (a Goddess); swiftly, and without mercy. The chaos that followed afterward, those who fell among its storm of bullets, went unmentioned.<br></p><p>That mission was your past \u2013 having occurred several months ago. However, Mike\u2019s funeral still haunted your mind. While training with him, you had never known that he had a family: a husband and a little daughter. Death had not frightened you before, and you thought it never would. But, after that night it began to follow you like a shadow.</p><p>It was raining the day you accompanied Luke to Mike\u2019s grave. He and Mike had been brothers: not by blood, but by heart. And in their last moment together, Mike had been Luke\u2019s shield.</p><p>Luke dreamt often that he took the bullets that had been meant for him, and that after he said goodbye to his brother, Mike would return home to his family and raise his daughter. When he woke, he would bury his face in his pillow, and <i>scream</i>. The screams would turn to wails.</p><p>As you both stood before Mike\u2019s gravestone, his daughter\u2019s letters soaked and ruined in the rain, you held Luke\u2019s hand and squeezed it in reassurance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re like pawns, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>His words dazed you. He had barely spoken since Mike\u2019s death. It was as if his voice disappeared with Mike\u2019s spirit. As the rain fell like tears around you, Luke turned towards you with tears in his own eyes, a frown creased into his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the Avengers,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even special agents. We\u2019re<i> disposable</i>. And they will never weep for us.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s words plagued you for a long time. It whispered from the back of your mind. They were drowned only once, by screams, on the day he died; your arms were painted with his blood as he took his last breath. Only you and your team wept for him. Nick Fury impassively addressed his death; he had seen so much death, and sent so many into destruction, that it was just another soldier sacrificing their life for their country. It was just another soldier sacrificing their lives for the powerful.</p><p>It was just <i>another </i>name.</p><p>Your sorrow turned to rage. And you frequently unleashed it in training. You grew deadlier. You were a storm, hungry for the wicked. Concern turned to fear. Your team remained faithful and constantly at your side. Jane no longer sparred with you \u2013 she was not ashamed to admit she found you intimidating in the training room \u2013 but instead would often sleep-over at your apartment and offer you whatever support you required.</p><p>Eventually, you gained the attention of your superiors; and, the eye of a certain red-haired assassin.</p><p>In her mind, she thought of the nervous recruit she had once reassured before a mission. But who she saw now barely reminded her of that person.</p><p>She watched you fight. There was a raw brutality in your moves. At first, the assassin felt impressed. Until, Clint wondered aloud, \u201cWhat tragedy did [he/she/they] go through to end up like that?\u201d</p><p>The Widow watched you more carefully with Clint\u2019s words in her mind; noticing the gloom in your eyes, the heaviness at your shoulders.</p><p><i>Like us?</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvzf8GxJ1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"></figure><p>Classic rock played in the background amongst gentle chatter.

And you did not want to. <i>They</i> never apologised. They never noticed people like you \u2013 people like Mike and Luke. The pawns would forever be unimportant to them, unworthy of notice.</p><p>Knocking back the remainder of your liquor, you gathered your belongings and trudged out of the bar. Into the embrace of the night; where no one would see your tears. Where no one in the world cared.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvzuwmkC1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"></figure><p>It was the first time you were assigned to a mission with <i>them</i>: The Avengers. You had your suspicions that Fury was trying to tempt you to accept his promotion. You refused to even meet his eye during briefing.<br></p><p>The <i>heroes</i> barely noticed your troop, as was expected. Once, you would have been as star-struck as your peers were in that moment. But all you felt now was sick.</p><p>Until <i>he</i> approached you. Agent Barton was as much a master assassin as The Widow was; but he was also a sarcastic jester. He held a mug each in his hands, filled to the brim with coffee, spilling <i>none</i> as he sat beside you. The frown of confusion on your face was instantaneous, and, no matter how hard you tried, it would not retreat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he greeted you lightly.</p><p>You watched him cautiously. \u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant some coffee?\u201d</p><p>A moment transpired. Too shocked to speak, you could only stare; but a bubble of laughter began to brew inside of you. You had assumed both mugs were for himself. It was not a farfetched assumption: many of you had witnessed him drink coffee straight from the coffee pot \u2013 on <i>frequent </i>occasions<i>.</i></p><p>\u201cNo one wants to drink coffee as black as your soul, Clint.\u201d It was her, jabbing her friend from where she stood \u2013 with<i> the Captain </i>himself.</p><p>Your smile was small; but did not go unnoticed by The Widow. There was a glint in her eyes as she turned away.</p><p>\u201cHardy-har-har.\u201d Clint glared good-naturedly in her direction before swiftly downing his coffee. Your frown returned; he did not flinch in the least from the bitterness.</p><p>To be honest, you were impressed.</p><p>It was then you realised the lower-ranked troops were not being ignored. It was typical for the low ranks to be brushed aside. But, as you glanced around, you noticed Captain Rogers had left Agent Romanoff\u2019s side and was now conversing with six soldiers, smiling as he recalled his days as one of them during the war. The \u201cGreat\u201d Tony Stark was taking selfies with a group of your acquaintances, a trace of grief in his eyes when he saw some of them raising the peace sign.</p><p>When your gaze found hers, you found her smiling \u2013 directly at you. Her arm felt warm when she came to sit \u2013 closely \u2013 beside you.</p><p>Guilt gnawed at your insides.</p><p>\u201cYou are all important.\u201d Her eyes were once more peering into your soul, but not selfishly nor carelessly; but with a tenderness that startled you. \u201cEvery single one of you. You have each other, but now you have us too. I talked to them\u2014\u201d she nodded her head towards her fellow Avengers\u2014 \u201cand we realised that we <i>have </i>been taking you all for granted. And we are <i>sincerely </i>sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>She was <i>beautiful</i>, but you realised, though she often smothered it, that her soul was what made her a so breath-taking. Despite the physical and mental scars, and the blood on her hands\u2026 she remained <i>kind</i>.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2013 about your friends. Michael and Luke were heroes. The bravest I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>There was a sorrow in her eyes, a deep understanding.</p><p><i>\u201cThey will never weep for us.\u201d</i></p><p>You smiled sadly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d</p><p>She understood, she was wise. You were apologising for something else. And she smiled back.</p><p><i>Yes, Luke, they will.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzw094Vtn1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"></figure><p>You grunted, collapsing against the wall. Blood seeped out of your shoulder wound, trickling between your fingers. Breath heaving, unsteady and faltering alongside your heartbeat, you listened carefully for her footsteps.<br></p><p>The assassin drew nearer, her deadly heels clicking against the floorboards. Better there than in your shoulder.</p><p>Gripping your shoulder tighter, you lifted your gun with your other hand, waiting\u2026 waiting\u2026 waiting\u2014</p><p>\u201c<i>Nat,\u201d </i>you whispered softly, closing your eyes. \u201c<i>Nat\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</i></p><p>From beyond the wall where you were leaning, she sneered, lifting her own gun.</p><p><i>It\u2019s now or never.</i></p><p>Abruptly, you got to your feet and jumped out from behind the wall, aiming your gun at her head. You saw her smirk, noticed her gun rising. Both triggers were pulled at the same time, the <i>bang</i>s echoing within the walls. As you fell, as if in slow motion, crying from the pain, you saw the droplets of blood spurt from the red hole in her forehead; watched her fall backwards along with you.</p><p>Your eyelids grew heavier. Darkness washed over the white ceiling. As you slipped away, her name rose to your lips, thrown out among the fading of your mind.</p><p>\u201c<i>Nat.</i>\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzw0rpBgd1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"></figure><p><i>\u201cWakey wakey, eggs and bakey.\u201d</i><br></p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d There was a throbbing ache spread throughout your body as you rose from the blackness of oblivion, blinking the grogginess from your eyes. A face loomed above you, smiling. Your heart leapt into your throat and you gave a small cry, startling the person. They stumbled back.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to stand too close.\u201d You recognised the dry and unimpressed voice: Tony Stark.</p><p>Continuing to blink as you returned to reality, you turned your head to gather your surroundings. The med-bay walls were far too recognisable, startlingly white. Gathered within the room was Clint, who you realised had been the one leaning over you, and Mr Stark. The latter was scrutinising the medical machines, making you fear for your life.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d you managed to say through your aching throat.</p><p>\u201cYou took her down, [Y/N],\u201d Clint replied, looking grim. \u201cBut you got hurt. Stab to the shoulder, bullet in the chest. Nowhere near your heart, thank god. You must have shot first; she most likely panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were nearby.\u201d Clint took your hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. You smiled; you needed it.</p><p>The door opened, but it was not in your range of vision. Footfalls grew closer to your bed, a breathless laughter approaching you. Tears welled in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou came for me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Natasha reached your side and immediately took your hand. You were surprised to see the glint of tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014 Of course I did.\u201d She lifted your hand to her lips, pressing a gentle kiss to your skin.</p><p>Her name had been at your lips in the chaos of your fight; a prayer; your hope. You remembered thinking that if you passed, you would do so with her in your thoughts, so you could die happy.</p><p>Your heart pattered wildly when she continued to hold your hand, a determination in her eyes that refused to let you go.</p><p>Even when she finally released her physical hold on you, she did not leave your side. Between missions she was always there, a selfless support that kept you afloat in a tumultuous ocean. Her calculating gaze watched you every second, either to determine what you required in order to swiftly recover, or simply to admire the determination etched across your face, the captivating way you smiled through the pain \u2013 and oh, what a smile you had.</p><p>Natasha held your hand every night before you went to sleep, promising you she was there at your side, silently vowing no one would hurt you again.</p><p>Praying to whomever ruled the skies that <i>no one would take you from her</i>. And in those moments, when you slipped into your sea of dreams, when she held her fingers to your throat in fear that you were gone, she tightened her grip on your hand and cried.</p><p><i>Love is for children. </i>But her heart would not stop aching, <i>pining</i> for you. She could not lose you, not to death, not even to life. <i>Love is for children, Natalia</i>.</p><p>Maybe, she thought, it wasn\u2019t love. Not the typical romantic emotion a living being would feel, but something <i>so much more</i>, something heavenly, perhaps even hellish \u2013 something <i>ethereal</i>.</p><p>As The Widow lifted your hand and kissed your knuckles, she finally consented to the truth of the matter: you had stolen her heart; or at least what was left of it.</p><p>And beneath your closed eyelids, you dreamt of her, red hair ablaze beneath the sunlight, smiling like an angel. In your sleep, you whispered her name.</p><p>\u201c<i>Natalia</i>.\u201d</p><hr><p><b><sub>will probably edit. stay tuned. :)</sub></b></p></p>",

Hastily you retrieved the weapons assigned to you and fit them into their holsters. Desperately you tried to regulate your breathing. Your stomach protested. Despite all the training, and the trust S.H.I.E.L.D. had bestowed upon your competence, you felt dread gnawing at your insides. Whispers, harsh and relentless, promised from the back of your head that you would fail \u2013 your first mission would end in tragedy. No matter how hard you tried to suppress them, they only grew stronger.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid,\u201d came a voice, like velvet, from the doorway.</p><p>There she stood, red hair ablaze in the sunlight: The Black Widow. Never before had you seen her this close. Having caught only glimpses of her from afar, and heard tales of her lethality, you were stunned to find that \u2013 something no one had told you \u2013 she was <i>beautiful</i>.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d As she asked the question, in a voice soft and yet strong, the corners of her lips arched upward.</p><p>\u201cY\u2014Yeah.\u201d The fumble of your voice caused her smirk to deepen. Cursing yourself intensely, you focused on preparing your weapons for the oncoming mission.</p><p>She approached you; the small heels of her shoes sounded like power against the metal floor. Once she had her guns and her gadgets, she turned to you and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>You glanced at her, fleetingly. Loading her gun, she began to leave. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>Barely above a whisper, you replied, \u201cBye\u2026\u201d</p><p>The sun set and plunged Russia into darkness. Hours had dragged by; which you spent in silence; within an armoured car alongside your team.</p><p>The car stopped. It was in the middle of nowhere, and yet you still had to walk the rest of the way. The mission was strictly <i>quiet</i>. The assassination of Ivan Petrov, one of Russia\u2019s most ruthless black market mobsters, was like dancing with danger \u2013 a dance that surely invited death. As you trudged through the snow, eyes squinted in the heavy snowfall, a scarf wrapped tight around your neck most of your face, the weight of your weapons troubled you; they dragged you down, to an early grave.</p><p>In the snow, standing large and proud was Petrov\u2019s holiday home. Even from afar you could tell it was <i>opulent</i> \u2013 a snobbish reminder of his immense wealth.</p><p>Your team\u2019s assignment was to neutralise the ground through immobilising the enemy\u2019s security. \u201cProtect Agent Romanoff,\u201d Fury had said. \u201cMake sure she gets out.\u201d</p><p>Petrov and his beating heart were at the mercy of The Widow.</p><p>Snow covered the immaculate garden\u2019s bush-art; no doubt the artistic intention. Clad in snow-white, your team darted through the garden, hiding behind the white bushes, swimming through the night\u2019s shadows; searching with your guns for the private security.</p><p>The men stood monstrously large; but not even Hercules could stop a bullet. The silencers softened each gunshot. The bullets ripped through the air; piercing flesh. There was a heaviness in your chest when the men crumpled to the ground. Shooting a gun was profoundly different when it was aimed at a living, breathing being; was it right to hold another\u2019s life in your hands?</p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by gunshots. The mansion came alive. \u00a0</p><p>Your team leader, Mike, gestured for you all to move inside. Footsteps covered the snow. From within, harsh sounds of shooting filled the air. Men descended the grand staircase as if out of nowhere. Shouts, Russian curses, were soon followed by gunshots. No longer able to contemplate whether it was right or wrong to take a life, you raised your gun and, taking aim, pulled the trigger.</p><p>The sound invaded your ears.</p><p>The bullet disappeared into his forehead.</p><p>\u201cFind cover!\u201d Mike grabbed your arm and pulled you behind a wall.</p><p>The symphony of gunshots continued; muffled by the blood roaring in your ears. A nearby vase shattered as a bullet flew through the wall past you. Glancing towards the bullet hole, heart sinking in horror, you realised just how close it was from hitting your head.</p><p>Shocked, you gripped your firearm to your chest and pushed yourself back against the wall. Breaths fell from your lips in heavy pants. In the rain of bullets fell the bodies of the unfortunate. Before you could snap out of your daze and stop him, Mike ran from cover with a shout. Down went your enemies, falling at the mercy (or lack thereof) of your team. Mikes yelling sounded distant.</p><p>Then, suddenly, it all stopped.</p><p>The scream came next. Glancing past the corner of the wall, you realised what had happened. Among the fallen lay Mike; already gone; his once warm brown eyes staring, emptily, at the ceiling. Blood covered his glistening dark skin. Leaning over him was Luke: Mike\u2019s best friend. His wails broke your heart.</p><p>Jane, a woman you often sparred with, crouched down beside the body and placed her fingers \u2013 hesitantly, as if fearing the inevitable result \u2013 at Mike\u2019s throat.</p><p>Everyone knew the truth. And yet, Jane\u2019s face fell, and she shook her head disappointedly.</p><p>It was as if you felt numb and yet restless. Your gun began to slip from your fingers; you did not bother to tighten your grip. It fell to your lap. It was in that moment, as Mike\u2019s body blurred in your tear-filled eyes, that you realised just how fleeting life was; how it felt to witness a comrade die.</p><p>A strange bitterness rose in your mouth. <i>This is my life now</i>, you thought. Luke sobbed, rocking Mike back and forth in his arms. <i>Killing\u2026 and waiting to die.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvz4mQIO1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"></figure><p>It was said that Ivan Petrov was assassinated as if by a vengeful God (a Goddess); swiftly, and without mercy. The chaos that followed afterward, those who fell among its storm of bullets, went unmentioned.<br></p><p>That mission was your past \u2013 having occurred several months ago. However, Mike\u2019s funeral still haunted your mind. While training with him, you had never known that he had a family: a husband and a little daughter. Death had not frightened you before, and you thought it never would. But, after that night it began to follow you like a shadow.</p><p>It was raining the day you accompanied Luke to Mike\u2019s grave. He and Mike had been brothers: not by blood, but by heart. And in their last moment together, Mike had been Luke\u2019s shield.</p><p>Luke dreamt often that he took the bullets that had been meant for him, and that after he said goodbye to his brother, Mike would return home to his family and raise his daughter. When he woke, he would bury his face in his pillow, and <i>scream</i>. The screams would turn to wails.</p><p>As you both stood before Mike\u2019s gravestone, his daughter\u2019s letters soaked and ruined in the rain, you held Luke\u2019s hand and squeezed it in reassurance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re like pawns, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>His words dazed you. He had barely spoken since Mike\u2019s death. It was as if his voice disappeared with Mike\u2019s spirit. As the rain fell like tears around you, Luke turned towards you with tears in his own eyes, a frown creased into his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the Avengers,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even special agents. We\u2019re<i> disposable</i>. And they will never weep for us.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s words plagued you for a long time. It whispered from the back of your mind. They were drowned only once, by screams, on the day he died; your arms were painted with his blood as he took his last breath. Only you and your team wept for him. Nick Fury impassively addressed his death; he had seen so much death, and sent so many into destruction, that it was just another soldier sacrificing their life for their country. It was just another soldier sacrificing their lives for the powerful.</p><p>It was just <i>another </i>name.</p><p>Your sorrow turned to rage. And you frequently unleashed it in training. You grew deadlier. You were a storm, hungry for the wicked. Concern turned to fear. Your team remained faithful and constantly at your side. Jane no longer sparred with you \u2013 she was not ashamed to admit she found you intimidating in the training room \u2013 but instead would often sleep-over at your apartment and offer you whatever support you required.</p><p>Eventually, you gained the attention of your superiors; and, the eye of a certain red-haired assassin.</p><p>In her mind, she thought of the nervous recruit she had once reassured before a mission. But who she saw now barely reminded her of that person.</p><p>She watched you fight. There was a raw brutality in your moves. At first, the assassin felt impressed. Until, Clint wondered aloud, \u201cWhat tragedy did [he/she/they] go through to end up like that?\u201d</p><p>The Widow watched you more carefully with Clint\u2019s words in her mind; noticing the gloom in your eyes, the heaviness at your shoulders.</p><p><i>Like us?</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvzf8GxJ1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"916\"></figure><p>Classic rock played in the background amongst gentle chatter. You rattled the ice cubes in your glass, watching them drown in amber liquid.<br></p><p>You did not often go to the bar, but tonight you were feeling particularly in need of a drink \u2013 a strong one.</p><p>Director Fury had offered you a promotion. He wanted you to be a special agent. He had asked you <i>in person</i>. Though it was more of an order, you had dared to refuse.</p><p>Mike and Luke died unhonoured, bleeding for their country in the shadows; you would never forget that, or them. If you had to remain in the shadows to notice and respect your peers, then you gladly would.</p><p>As your surroundings became gradually blurrier and blurrier, a red-headed woman approached you at the counter. She went unnoticed as she took the seat by your side, a smirk at her lips when she realised the extent of your intoxication.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid.\u201d</p><p>Even in a drunken haze, your mind registered her voice, her words. A rapid rhythm overcame your heart and, although you were curious as to why<i> the Black Widow </i>was at your side at a bar, you intently focused your eyes on your drink. The ice cubes were melting \u2013 like your brain.</p><p>\u201cI know you remember me.\u201d Her smirk was yet to leave her lips.</p><p>The words slipped from your tongue before you could stop them. \u201cIt would be impossible not to.\u201d</p><p><i>Red hair in the shadows: crimson like the blood of Ivan Petrov.</i> <i>Carnage in her beautiful eyes.</i></p><p>\u201cI could say the same about you.\u201d From your peripheral vision you saw her slide a file towards you.

Finally, you turned towards her, your wide eyes merely staring straight back. She was still scrutinising you, taking you apart and putting you back together; the thought of having no privacy, of being sifted through, left a bitter taste in your mouth.</p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re not the Avengers.\u201d</i></p><p>Luke\u2019s voice rose through the haze in your mind.<i> </i>Resentment burned in you as you stared into her eyes, the same eyes you feared that night when you had watched her walk past fallen bodies with only the trace of murder in her soul.</p><p><i>\u201cAnd they will never weep for us.\u201d</i></p><p>Your intoxication provided a courage you could never have mustered before, in the face of an <i>assassin</i>, of someone far more important than you could ever be. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like you,\u201d you almost spat.</p><p>The shock, and traces of distress in her eyes offered a jolt of guilt in you; but your tongue was like lead, unable to move, unable to apologise.

You saw her smirk, noticed her gun rising. Both triggers were pulled at the same time, the <i>bang</i>s echoing within the walls. As you fell, as if in slow motion, crying from the pain, you saw the droplets of blood spurt from the red hole in her forehead; watched her fall backwards along with you.</p><p>Your eyelids grew heavier.

A face loomed above you, smiling. Your heart leapt into your throat and you gave a small cry, startling the person. They stumbled back.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to stand too close.\u201d You recognised the dry and unimpressed voice: Tony Stark.</p><p>Continuing to blink as you returned to reality, you turned your head to gather your surroundings. The med-bay walls were far too recognisable, startlingly white. Gathered within the room was Clint, who you realised had been the one leaning over you, and Mr Stark. The latter was scrutinising the medical machines, making you fear for your life.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d you managed to say through your aching throat.</p><p>\u201cYou took her down, [Y/N],\u201d Clint replied, looking grim. \u201cBut you got hurt.

You smiled; you needed it.</p><p>The door opened, but it was not in your range of vision. Footfalls grew closer to your bed, a breathless laughter approaching you. Tears welled in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou came for me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Natasha reached your side and immediately took your hand. You were surprised to see the glint of tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014 Of course I did.\u201d She lifted your hand to her lips, pressing a gentle kiss to your skin.</p><p>Her name had been at your lips in the chaos of your fight; a prayer; your hope. You remembered thinking that if you passed, you would do so with her in your thoughts, so you could die happy.</p><p>Your heart pattered wildly when she continued to hold your hand, a determination in her eyes that refused to let you go.</p><p>Even when she finally released her physical hold on you, she did not leave your side. Between missions she was always there, a selfless support that kept you afloat in a tumultuous ocean. Her calculating gaze watched you every second, either to determine what you required in order to swiftly recover, or simply to admire the determination etched across your face, the captivating way you smiled through the pain \u2013 and oh, what a smile you had.</p><p>Natasha held your hand every night before you went to sleep, promising you she was there at your side, silently vowing no one would hurt you again.</p><p>Praying to whomever ruled the skies that <i>no one would take you from her</i>. And in those moments, when you slipped into your sea of dreams, when she held her fingers to your throat in fear that you were gone, she tightened her grip on your hand and cried.</p><p><i>Love is for children. </i>But her heart would not stop aching, <i>pining</i> for you. She could not lose you, not to death, not even to life. <i>Love is for children, Natalia</i>.</p><p>Maybe, she thought, it wasn\u2019t love.

Hastily you retrieved the weapons assigned to you and fit them into their holsters. Desperately you tried to regulate your breathing. Your stomach protested. Despite all the training, and the trust S.H.I.E.L.D. had bestowed upon your competence, you felt dread gnawing at your insides. Whispers, harsh and relentless, promised from the back of your head that you would fail &ndash; your first mission would end in tragedy. No matter how hard you tried to suppress them, they only grew stronger.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, kid,&rdquo; came a voice, like velvet, from the doorway.</p><p>There she stood, red hair ablaze in the sunlight: The Black Widow. Never before had you seen her this close. Having caught only glimpses of her from afar, and heard tales of her lethality, you were stunned to find that &ndash; something no one had told you &ndash; she was <i>beautiful</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo; As she asked the question, in a voice soft and yet strong, the corners of her lips arched upward.</p><p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;Yeah.&rdquo; The fumble of your voice caused her smirk to deepen. Cursing yourself intensely, you focused on preparing your weapons for the oncoming mission.</p><p>She approached you; the small heels of her shoes sounded like power against the metal floor. Once she had her guns and her gadgets, she turned to you and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>You glanced at her, fleetingly. Loading her gun, she began to leave. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</p><p>Barely above a whisper, you replied, &ldquo;Bye&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The sun set and plunged Russia into darkness. Hours had dragged by; which you spent in silence; within an armoured car alongside your team.</p><p>The car stopped. It was in the middle of nowhere, and yet you still had to walk the rest of the way. The mission was strictly <i>quiet</i>. The assassination of Ivan Petrov, one of Russia&rsquo;s most ruthless black market mobsters, was like dancing with danger &ndash; a dance that surely invited death. As you trudged through the snow, eyes squinted in the heavy snowfall, a scarf wrapped tight around your neck most of your face, the weight of your weapons troubled you; they dragged you down, to an early grave.</p><p>In the snow, standing large and proud was Petrov&rsquo;s holiday home. Even from afar you could tell it was <i>opulent</i> &ndash; a snobbish reminder of his immense wealth.</p><p>Your team&rsquo;s assignment was to neutralise the ground through immobilising the enemy&rsquo;s security. &ldquo;Protect Agent Romanoff,&rdquo; Fury had said. &ldquo;Make sure she gets out.&rdquo;</p><p>Petrov and his beating heart were at the mercy of The Widow.</p><p>Snow covered the immaculate garden&rsquo;s bush-art; no doubt the artistic intention. Clad in snow-white, your team darted through the garden, hiding behind the white bushes, swimming through the night&rsquo;s shadows; searching with your guns for the private security.</p><p>The men stood monstrously large; but not even Hercules could stop a bullet. The silencers softened each gunshot. The bullets ripped through the air; piercing flesh. There was a heaviness in your chest when the men crumpled to the ground. Shooting a gun was profoundly different when it was aimed at a living, breathing being; was it right to hold another&rsquo;s life in your hands?</p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by gunshots. The mansion came alive. &nbsp;</p><p>Your team leader, Mike, gestured for you all to move inside. Footsteps covered the snow. From within, harsh sounds of shooting filled the air. Men descended the grand staircase as if out of nowhere. Shouts, Russian curses, were soon followed by gunshots. No longer able to contemplate whether it was right or wrong to take a life, you raised your gun and, taking aim, pulled the trigger.</p><p>The sound invaded your ears.</p><p>The bullet disappeared into his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Find cover!&rdquo; Mike grabbed your arm and pulled you behind a wall.</p><p>The symphony of gunshots continued; muffled by the blood roaring in your ears. A nearby vase shattered as a bullet flew through the wall past you. Glancing towards the bullet hole, heart sinking in horror, you realised just how close it was from hitting your head.</p><p>Shocked, you gripped your firearm to your chest and pushed yourself back against the wall. Breaths fell from your lips in heavy pants. In the rain of bullets fell the bodies of the unfortunate. Before you could snap out of your daze and stop him, Mike ran from cover with a shout. Down went your enemies, falling at the mercy (or lack thereof) of your team. Mikes yelling sounded distant.</p><p>Then, suddenly, it all stopped.</p><p>The scream came next. Glancing past the corner of the wall, you realised what had happened. Among the fallen lay Mike; already gone; his once warm brown eyes staring, emptily, at the ceiling. Blood covered his glistening dark skin. Leaning over him was Luke: Mike&rsquo;s best friend. His wails broke your heart.</p><p>Jane, a woman you often sparred with, crouched down beside the body and placed her fingers &ndash; hesitantly, as if fearing the inevitable result &ndash; at Mike&rsquo;s throat.</p><p>Everyone knew the truth. And yet, Jane&rsquo;s face fell, and she shook her head disappointedly.</p><p>It was as if you felt numb and yet restless. Your gun began to slip from your fingers; you did not bother to tighten your grip. It fell to your lap. It was in that moment, as Mike&rsquo;s body blurred in your tear-filled eyes, that you realised just how fleeting life was; how it felt to witness a comrade die.</p><p>A strange bitterness rose in your mouth. <i>This is my life now</i>, you thought. Luke sobbed, rocking Mike back and forth in his arms. <i>Killing&hellip; and waiting to die.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvz4mQIO1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It was said that Ivan Petrov was assassinated as if by a vengeful God (a Goddess); swiftly, and without mercy. The chaos that followed afterward, those who fell among its storm of bullets, went unmentioned.<br /></p><p>That mission was your past &ndash; having occurred several months ago. However, Mike&rsquo;s funeral still haunted your mind. While training with him, you had never known that he had a family: a husband and a little daughter. Death had not frightened you before, and you thought it never would. But, after that night it began to follow you like a shadow.</p><p>It was raining the day you accompanied Luke to Mike&rsquo;s grave. He and Mike had been brothers: not by blood, but by heart. And in their last moment together, Mike had been Luke&rsquo;s shield.</p><p>Luke dreamt often that he took the bullets that had been meant for him, and that after he said goodbye to his brother, Mike would return home to his family and raise his daughter. When he woke, he would bury his face in his pillow, and <i>scream</i>. The screams would turn to wails.</p><p>As you both stood before Mike&rsquo;s gravestone, his daughter&rsquo;s letters soaked and ruined in the rain, you held Luke&rsquo;s hand and squeezed it in reassurance.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re like pawns, [Y/N].&rdquo;</p><p>His words dazed you. He had barely spoken since Mike&rsquo;s death. It was as if his voice disappeared with Mike&rsquo;s spirit. As the rain fell like tears around you, Luke turned towards you with tears in his own eyes, a frown creased into his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the Avengers,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t even special agents. We&rsquo;re<i> disposable</i>. And they will never weep for us.&rdquo;</p><p>Luke&rsquo;s words plagued you for a long time. It whispered from the back of your mind. They were drowned only once, by screams, on the day he died; your arms were painted with his blood as he took his last breath. Only you and your team wept for him. Nick Fury impassively addressed his death; he had seen so much death, and sent so many into destruction, that it was just another soldier sacrificing their life for their country. It was just another soldier sacrificing their lives for the powerful.</p><p>It was just <i>another </i>name.</p><p>Your sorrow turned to rage. And you frequently unleashed it in training. You grew deadlier. You were a storm, hungry for the wicked. Concern turned to fear. Your team remained faithful and constantly at your side. Jane no longer sparred with you &ndash; she was not ashamed to admit she found you intimidating in the training room &ndash; but instead would often sleep-over at your apartment and offer you whatever support you required.</p><p>Eventually, you gained the attention of your superiors; and, the eye of a certain red-haired assassin.</p><p>In her mind, she thought of the nervous recruit she had once reassured before a mission. But who she saw now barely reminded her of that person.</p><p>She watched you fight. There was a raw brutality in your moves. At first, the assassin felt impressed. Until, Clint wondered aloud, &ldquo;What tragedy did [he/she/they] go through to end up like that?&rdquo;</p><p>The Widow watched you more carefully with Clint&rsquo;s words in her mind; noticing the gloom in your eyes, the heaviness at your shoulders.</p><p><i>Like us?</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzvzf8GxJ1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Classic rock played in the background amongst gentle chatter. You rattled the ice cubes in your glass, watching them drown in amber liquid.<br /></p><p>You did not often go to the bar, but tonight you were feeling particularly in need of a drink &ndash; a strong one.</p><p>Director Fury had offered you a promotion. He wanted you to be a special agent. He had asked you <i>in person</i>. Though it was more of an order, you had dared to refuse.</p><p>Mike and Luke died unhonoured, bleeding for their country in the shadows; you would never forget that, or them. If you had to remain in the shadows to notice and respect your peers, then you gladly would.</p><p>As your surroundings became gradually blurrier and blurrier, a red-headed woman approached you at the counter. She went unnoticed as she took the seat by your side, a smirk at her lips when she realised the extent of your intoxication.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Even in a drunken haze, your mind registered her voice, her words. A rapid rhythm overcame your heart and, although you were curious as to why<i> the Black Widow </i>was at your side at a bar, you intently focused your eyes on your drink. The ice cubes were melting &ndash; like your brain.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you remember me.&rdquo; Her smirk was yet to leave her lips.</p><p>The words slipped from your tongue before you could stop them. &ldquo;It would be impossible not to.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Red hair in the shadows: crimson like the blood of Ivan Petrov.</i> <i>Carnage in her beautiful eyes.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I could say the same about you.&rdquo; From your peripheral vision you saw her slide a file towards you.

I talked to them&mdash;&rdquo; she nodded her head towards her fellow Avengers&mdash; &ldquo;and we realised that we <i>have </i>been taking you all for granted. And we are <i>sincerely </i>sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Without you,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t win.&rdquo;</p><p>She was <i>beautiful</i>, but you realised, though she often smothered it, that her soul was what made her a so breath-taking. Despite the physical and mental scars, and the blood on her hands&hellip; she remained <i>kind</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry &ndash; about your friends. Michael and Luke were heroes. The bravest I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a sorrow in her eyes, a deep understanding.</p><p><i>&ldquo;They will never weep for us.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You smiled sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, too.&rdquo;</p><p>She understood, she was wise. You were apologising for something else. And she smiled back.</p><p><i>Yes, Luke, they will.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzw094Vtn1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You grunted, collapsing against the wall. Blood seeped out of your shoulder wound, trickling between your fingers. Breath heaving, unsteady and faltering alongside your heartbeat, you listened carefully for her footsteps.<br /></p><p>The assassin drew nearer, her deadly heels clicking against the floorboards. Better there than in your shoulder.</p><p>Gripping your shoulder tighter, you lifted your gun with your other hand, waiting&hellip; waiting&hellip; waiting&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Nat,&rdquo; </i>you whispered softly, closing your eyes. &ldquo;<i>Nat&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</i></p><p>From beyond the wall where you were leaning, she sneered, lifting her own gun.</p><p><i>It&rsquo;s now or never.</i></p><p>Abruptly, you got to your feet and jumped out from behind the wall, aiming your gun at her head. You saw her smirk, noticed her gun rising. Both triggers were pulled at the same time, the <i>bang</i>s echoing within the walls. As you fell, as if in slow motion, crying from the pain, you saw the droplets of blood spurt from the red hole in her forehead; watched her fall backwards along with you.</p><p>Your eyelids grew heavier. Darkness washed over the white ceiling. As you slipped away, her name rose to your lips, thrown out among the fading of your mind.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Nat.</i>&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e88742fdb26a840202a1ee70ecac35fc/tumblr_inline_pkzw0rpBgd1sc7hcw_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>&ldquo;Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; There was a throbbing ache spread throughout your body as you rose from the blackness of oblivion, blinking the grogginess from your eyes. A face loomed above you, smiling. Your heart leapt into your throat and you gave a small cry, startling the person. They stumbled back.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you not to stand too close.&rdquo; You recognised the dry and unimpressed voice: Tony Stark.</p><p>Continuing to blink as you returned to reality, you turned your head to gather your surroundings. The med-bay walls were far too recognisable, startlingly white. Gathered within the room was Clint, who you realised had been the one leaning over you, and Mr Stark. The latter was scrutinising the medical machines, making you fear for your life.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; you managed to say through your aching throat.</p><p>&ldquo;You took her down, [Y/N],&rdquo; Clint replied, looking grim. &ldquo;But you got hurt. Stab to the shoulder, bullet in the chest. Nowhere near your heart, thank god. You must have shot first; she most likely panicked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did I get out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were nearby.&rdquo; Clint took your hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. You smiled; you needed it.</p><p>The door opened, but it was not in your range of vision. Footfalls grew closer to your bed, a breathless laughter approaching you. Tears welled in your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You came for me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha reached your side and immediately took your hand. You were surprised to see the glint of tears in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash; Of course I did.&rdquo; She lifted your hand to her lips, pressing a gentle kiss to your skin.</p><p>Her name had been at your lips in the chaos of your fight; a prayer; your hope. You remembered thinking that if you passed, you would do so with her in your thoughts, so you could die happy.</p><p>Your heart pattered wildly when she continued to hold your hand, a determination in her eyes that refused to let you go.</p><p>Even when she finally released her physical hold on you, she did not leave your side. Between missions she was always there, a selfless support that kept you afloat in a tumultuous ocean. Her calculating gaze watched you every second, either to determine what you required in order to swiftly recover, or simply to admire the determination etched across your face, the captivating way you smiled through the pain &ndash; and oh, what a smile you had.</p><p>Natasha held your hand every night before you went to sleep, promising you she was there at your side, silently vowing no one would hurt you again.</p><p>Praying to whomever ruled the skies that <i>no one would take you from her</i>. And in those moments, when you slipped into your sea of dreams, when she held her fingers to your throat in fear that you were gone, she tightened her grip on your hand and cried.</p><p><i>Love is for children. </i>But her heart would not stop aching, <i>pining</i> for you. She could not lose you, not to death, not even to life. <i>Love is for children, Natalia</i>.</p><p>Maybe, she thought, it wasn&rsquo;t love. Not the typical romantic emotion a living being would feel, but something <i>so much more</i>, something heavenly, perhaps even hellish &ndash; something <i>ethereal</i>.</p><p>As The Widow lifted your hand and kissed your knuckles, she finally consented to the truth of the matter: you had stolen her heart; or at least what was left of it.</p><p>And beneath your closed eyelids, you dreamt of her, red hair ablaze beneath the sunlight, smiling like an angel. In your sleep, you whispered her name.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Natalia</i>.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><b><sub>will probably edit. stay tuned. :)</sub></b></p></p>",

Thanks very much.\u201d</i></p><p><i>With his legs comfortably crossed and his shoulder draped with a small hotel towel, Sam breathed in the warm and humid air of Puerto Vallarta.\u00a0 It was much thicker than the air in Cuba, much warmer than the air in South Korea, and much more relaxing than the air in Los Angeles. Perhaps it felt\u00a0\u2018much better\u2019 simply because he finally left his long-term girlfriend from high school, won $20,000 on the slots in Hong Kong, or because he was absolutely alone.\u00a0 Whatever it was, Sam sipped his brand-new sangria as he pondered the options. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Traveling wasn\u2019t all glamour and big bucks. It took connections and some great taste in all things expensive. It didn\u2019t make much difference to Sam if he was rich or poor. He was enjoying the freedom.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>If Sam was questioned about it, he would claim he traveled better alone, experienced things with a greater mind that way. If it were up to him, he would only speak to another human being when needed. But he didn\u2019t have to- not when everything was so perfect.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It was obviously some much needed\u00a0\u2018alone time\u2019 after such an abrupt end to yet another strong relationship, but that\u2019s what was foreshadowed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He would never admit it to anyone yet and probably would always keep it locked away in the confines of his chest, growing and expanding. He would never find peace with himself, no matter how many times he sipped on delicious drinks and got the accurate daily dose of vitamin D.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He was extremely close to coming out to Dylan, the pool boy for his second cousin in England. He got close to telling Phil, the nice and rhythmic Jamaican that lived in the apartment next to his one summer. Sam had even told the fireman in France that he was \u2018 heating up in places he shouldn\u2019t be\u2019, but quickly averted that awkward conversation to pointing at his neck and the oxygen tank instead. Sam almost mentioned it once or twice to Steve but decided against it- he, himself, simply wasn\u2019t ready.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>So, Sam quickly packed his suitcase and left a lovely, hand-written note to his latest love, Dave. Carefully placing the note in-between Dave\u2019s medication and the cup of water on his nightstand, Sam debated once more.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>A kiss goodbye? Should he just not leave?</i></p><p><i>Maybe he\u2019d stay and tear the note and switch to\u00a0\u2018loving boyfriend\u2019 mode and make Dave\u2019s studio apartment smell like those burnt pancakes he loves so much. Or maybe Sam could visit Venice, Italy- he had never been there.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Sam eventually went with the second option, like always, and left the apartment with a glum expression and an even tighter chest than before.\u00a0</i></p><hr><p><b>THREE YEARS LATER</b></p><p><b></b>\u201cHow\u2019s the couch treating yuh?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s little quip almost ruined Bucky\u2019s morning, but after breathing in the cool, Christmas morning air he quickly kicked off the three blankets with a happy look on his face. All red nosed and tangled curls sitting on top of his head, Bucky simply stuck his tongue out Sam and walked past him to start the coffee for five people.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fantastic, actually. How was your night?\u201d Bucky replied.\u00a0</p><p>Sam raised his eyebrows for a couple of seconds, but quickly set them down when he realized Bucky was only trying to fit into the holiday morning. Just the other night Bucky had almost blown someone\u2019s head off and today he was actually trying to act less frightened.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI slept great as well,\u201d Sam smiled, gently clapping the table once and made his way to the balcony. Steve had been there for about fifteen minutes before Sam had woken, enjoying the morning breeze.\u00a0</p><p>The sound of the window creaking open snapped Steve from his original gaze and landed on Sam instead.\u00a0 Sam raised his hands as an apology for the harsh sound but moved to stand next to his best friend. The two stood for a couple minutes without a sound, listening to the calmness of Brooklyn before people began getting up to start the Christmas day. By the time the fourth bird sang its song, Sam gently shoved Steve\u2019s shoulder to alert him of his morning greeting.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled as a reply, a quiet sigh exiting his nose followed by a breeze of cold air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI hope you weren\u2019t expecting a Christmas present. But I think my presence is enough. So, it counts.\u201d</p><p>It was Steve\u2019s turn to shove Sam to the side. Steve hugged the blanket tighter to his body and once he noticed Sam wore no warm cover, he suggested they head back inside.\u00a0\u201cAs much as this morning calms me, I think we should freeze inside the building instead.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded in agreement, following the tall blonde through the creaking window. As they stepped back into the living room, you had emerged in your\u00a0\u2018angel\u2019 uniform. It\u2019s description could be kept short considering Steve had already scanned every single detail during your first encounter. But the diamonds and white silk still made him weak in the knees. Sam choked on his spit loudly, instantly covering himself with the same blanket Steve was wrapped in. He squeezed himself against Steve and stared at you in astonishment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGirl, what are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>You chuckled, lugging your suitcase and large coat in both hands. You dropped them on the couch and did a slight twirl to your audience.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas.\u00a0 Perhaps one of the busiest days of the year. Besides Valentine\u2019s Day and Super Bowl Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Bucky had stopped pouring his coffee to stare at you in awe. He was quiet, deciding to listen to the conversation rather than intrude.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut&hellip; it\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Sam whined, snuggling closer to Steve. Steve decided to join the dramatics, just in case you were to change your mind. He snuggled closer to Sam as well, and made a puppy-dog face to entice you with the idea of warmth. You rolled your eyes at the men and waved them off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the main set today. Tips will be flooding at the doorway, gentleman,\u201d you laughed and put on your oversized coat.\u00a0\u201cYou gotta learn from this hard-working woman.\u201d</p><p>Steve continued to shake his head,\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want some rent money or not?\u201d</p><p>Steve puckered his lips and raised his eyebrows in an exaggerated look of understanding.\u00a0\u201cCool, cool, cool, cool, cool. No doubt, no doubt, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you would ever want me to miss out on all the guilty dough from sad men celebrating Christmas in a strip club,\u201d you twirled again, this way making your way to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>Christmas, no matter how lonely it was in the mornings and the nights you returned, was always your biggest hit.\u00a0It was as if the momentary dancing and singing and money being thrown at you was enough to numb your pain for a long while. You had always made enough money to buy a new needle or alcohol. If you had dressed better than the months before, or danced greater, or showed a little more skin, the men always gave you enough to buy some more smack. \u00a0</p><p>But you had quit. You had thrown away all of your needles. You didn\u2019t have the temptation anymore. The more you worked, however, the more temptation would itch.</p><p>But this was for rent money. Something you were always behind on, anyway.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys come hang? There\u2019s nothing here to get you in the spirit,\u201d you laughed, grabbing yourself a styrofoam cup to pour some cream and coffee in.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky smiled as you twirled around him, still hesitant about interrupting a conversation.\u00a0</p><p>You stopped in front of him,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to make it to my set, right?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes widened slightly. He had seen you dance on his drunken nights in the city when he used to visit Steve, but never had he voluntarily watched while sober.</p><p>Sam answered instead,\u00a0\u201cUs? Watch you&hellip; strip?\u201d</p><p>For the second time that joyous morning, you rolled your eyes.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll probably see just a little nip slip. Don\u2019t worry too much about it.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled brightly, teeth showing and everything.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to be the loudest and grandest tipper there!\u201d</p><p>Your expression of delight turned into confusion.\u00a0\u201cWhy would you waste your money, when it\u2019s gonna go into my pocket, and then back into this apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sam sighed. After a few chuckles, the sound of the door unlocking caught everyone\u2019s attention. Peggy scurried inside with a tray of chocolate chip cookies and her\u00a0\u2018Best Cook\u2019 apron wrapped around her waist.\u00a0The four of you cheered and lunged at her, devouring her treats and locking her into the previous conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou gonna enjoy this miracle with us, Peggy?\u201d Steve asked, mouth full of cookie. Peggy smiled at him and handed him a tiny napkin.</p><p>\u201cSure! I appreciate any form of dance! Just ask Steve.\u201d</p><p>Sam grabbed his cup of black coffee and took a long sip before he replied to Peggy\u2019s comment.\u00a0\u201cYou managed to teach Steve something besides the sidestep?\u201d</p><hr><p>You quickly fixed your bra backstage, grinning at the constant muttering of the guys at the front of the stage. If you heard correctly, Bucky wanted to give the taxpayers their seats because they weren\u2019t going to throw anything anyway.\u00a0 And you briefly heard Steve say\u00a0\u2018shut the fuck up\u2019 once in a while.\u00a0</p><p>The girls backstage wished you luck, a wider smile than usual on all of their faces. As sad as it was, Christmas day brought more customers and with that, more money. With one final stretch of the arms, you walked onto the stage in the dark.\u00a0 A mic was strung from the back of your bra and through your hair, the tip reaching the beginning of your forehead. You held onto the pole as the drums started to pound and the lights brightened you up.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s the time? Well, it\u2019s gotta be close to midnight!\u201d</i><br/></p><p>You danced and sang your heart out like you would any other day. Your voice vibrated off the walls beautifully and the men reacted like any straight man would be.\u00a0</p><p>You reached the end of the stage and rolled over on your stomach, extending your legs outwards and then rolled over onto your back.\u00a0 Pushing yourself up, you leaned out into the crowd and smiled at your new roommates. So engrossed in your little dance, they were simply staring at you and then the wall&hellip; then you&hellip; then the wall.\u00a0</p><p>To get the best tips possible and as a silent\u00a0<i>\u201cI got this\u201d </i>to your friends, you hit the floor once again. Belting and following rhythm, you ended up on your back once again. You had it, you certainly did as any of the boys would exclaim, when you lifted your legs into the air and unlocked them, spreading them wide open for the whole audience.\u00a0 A cheeky look was all it was and it gave you breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the whole apartment for three whole days.\u00a0</p><p>You wrapped up and headed back behind the curtain, wishing the next girl luck as you caught your breath.\u00a0</p><p>The girls were all acquaintances and you knew everyone\u2019s first and last name. There were no strangers. Every girl knew you and every girl spoke with Luke. It was a small community. However, no backstories were ever shared.\u00a0 No one knew how many siblings each person had or if they were sleeping under a roof every night. So, it would make sense that no one knew each other\u2019s past addictions. You stopped in your tracks as you saw a suspicious teenage boy hand a little baggy to one of the girls who had already performed. You swallowed hard and averted your eyes quickly, heading over to your table to grab your clothes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter,\u201d the girl muttered, wiping her nose in the process. The boy looked at the woman with a hint of sympathy before he nodded and slipped out the back door. She turned around and almost yelped when she saw you staring.\u00a0<br/></p><p>She looked to the floor,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I, um&hellip; needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain anything to me,\u201d you smiled slightly. She nodded quickly and grabbed her purse, exiting the same back door.\u00a0</p><p>You could feel the itch in your throat and a headache aching to break through. Without a second thought, you ran to the back door and squinted at the afternoon light. She was gone and so was the itch. Almost.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNeed something?\u201d<br/></p><p>You turned and saw the boy near the door smoking a cigarette. You cleared your throat uncomfortably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a little young to deal?\u201d<br/></p><p>The boy chuckled,\u00a0\u201cHave to pay the bills in New York some way, right? I\u2019m guessing you understand completely.\u201d</p><p>His response was sort of backhanded but you ignored it. Instead, you left to reenter the building.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot gonna buy anything?\u201d<br/></p><p>You stopped in your tracks, looking at his pale green eyes. You always knew a dealer\u2019s number one rule was to never try out the product. But you could tell her enjoyed it more than he should.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d you stuttered. It was then that you felt so cold, the afternoon air biting you in the face. Peter smiled and grabbed your arm quickly, making you jolt. You felt his hand slide into your jacket pocket and slide back out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFree handout.\u201d<br/></p><p>Before you could reject, he sprinted down the alley and out of sight. You let out a heavy breath, feeling the unbelievable weight of the tiny bag.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Steve exited the bathroom after taking his medication, joining his friends at the kitchen table. Everyone was eating the takeout you had bought right after your set.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat blonde chick&hellip; ugh- I can\u2019t&hellip; I can\u2019t stop thinking about her,\u201d Peggy joked. You laughed and told Peggy her name, also adding that she was most likely single.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Steve joined,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t go giving Peggy girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows and ate a mouthful of kung-pao chicken before speaking.\u00a0\u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Steve answered immediately,\u00a0\u201cBecause I think she\u2019s interested in someone else anyway.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes and saw Peggy\u2019s eyes leave Steve\u2019s to hide her blush. You chewed with your new found knowledge, deciding to change the subject.\u00a0\u201cSo, what did everyone think of the set?\u201d</p><p>Bucky answered first.\u00a0\u201cIt was surprisingly great.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed quietly,\u00a0\u201cSurprisingly?\u201d</p><p>Sam rolled his eyes and nudged your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cBucky meant the surprise in his jeans.\u201d</p><p>Bucky almost catapulted from his seat to pounce on Sam but he held himself together. He opted for a shy shake of the head instead. To save him as well, you brought your attention back to Sam.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Sam? Any girl catch your eye besides me? I could tell you loved me the most by how much fidgeting you were doing,\u201d you teased, lying about the last part.\u00a0\u201cI could always get someone\u2019s number.\u201d<br/></p><p>Sam continued to eat his noodles,\u00a0\u201cNot really. You did great, of course.\u201d</p><hr><p>The room was filled with laughter for a couple more hours before nightfall came. Before everyone retreated back to their rooms and Peggy back to her apartment, Sam presented a number of bags from behind the couch. Everyone\u2019s mouth fell open.\u00a0</p><p>Steve almost let a tear slip.\u00a0\u201cSam, you didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Bucky also agreed with Steve,\u00a0\u201cYou really didn\u2019t. Dude&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Sam raised the bags in the air,\u00a0\u201cYeah, yeah. But it\u2019s Christmas! Here\u2019s one for you&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He handed a bag to everyone, including you. You looked at him in disbelief.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did you even have time?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know when the orange-haired chick had that ten minute set?\u201d<br/></p><p>Everyone muttered in recognition.\u00a0\u201cYeah, I left for a good thirty minutes after she took the stage.\u201d</p><p>You snorted silently, covering your mouth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOpen them! Open them!\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve went first, ripping the paper out from the bag and looking inside. He released a heavy sigh and pulled a first-aid kit.\u00a0\u201cWow, thanks. Just what I needed.\u201d</p><p>Sam brushed off Steve\u2019s silent muttering of the word\u00a0\u201cdick\u201d. Bucky opened his next, pulling out a new can of pepper spray. He scrunched his eyebrows and waited for Sam to explain.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, that shit\u2019s for when you wake up ready to kill us in the mornings.\u201d<br/></p><p>Everyone shared a tiny chuckle and pushed back the memory of a gun in their face.\u00a0</p><p>You pulled the paper from your bag and found a bag of Doritos.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou need carbs. Okay! Peggy! You\u2019re last!\u201d You pushed your tongue to the roof of your mouth to restrain yourself from both beating Sam and laughing out loud.\u00a0</p><p>Peggy pulled a key from her bag. She pursed her lips and thought about what it could be for.\u00a0</p><p>Sam asked for it to show her. She handed the key to him and everyone watched as he went up to the front door, opened it, and locked and unlocked it from the front. Peggy\u2019s eyes widened, as did everyone else\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>Sam threw the key back at her,\u00a0\u201cWhenever you get too lonely, or want to see Steve or anyone one of us, which is highly unlikely.\u201d Steve just stood shaking his head at his best friend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr when you finally decide to move-in.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peggy remained silent but threw herself at Sam and gave him a big hug. It was a grand gesture, one that no one was opposed to.\u00a0</p><p>And just like that, a nice moment was ruined when a knock at the door disturbed you. The face behind the door was not really unexpected, especially since he popped up out of nowhere all the time. If it wasn\u2019t for a packed apartment, Steve would have punched T\u2019Challa for ruining a nice night.\u00a0</p><p>Instead, T\u2019Challa stood and apologized for his presence right away.\u00a0\u201cI apologize for my showing. I just wanted to deliver the news instead of having a poster strung up on your door.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s heart fell. A slight ping pinched at his chest but the loud voices behind him made him forget about it. There was protesting already before T\u2019Challa had even delivered the news.\u00a0</p><p>T\u2019Challa stepped into the apartment and shut the door behind him. He waited until an opening in the argument allowed him to speak.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to tell you in person that I had to sign the contracts. But I promise that I will push this project as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scoffed,\u00a0\u201cSo, instead of kicking us out right away you want us to wait and wonder when all your pushing is going to finally fail?\u201d</p><p>It was silent. T\u2019Challa sighed and reached into his pocket. Before he could pull anything out, Steve stormed out with Bucky and Peggy following him.\u00a0</p><p>You and Sam stood in the middle of the kitchen awkwardly, looking at each other and back at T\u2019Challa. Sam looked T\u2019Challa up and down while you fiddled with the interior of your jacket pocket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere. Take it. Please,\u201d T\u2019Challa said, holding out an envelope that looked to be filled with money. Sam furrowed his eyebrows and continued to stare at T\u2019Challa.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou want us to take money from the one evicting us? Is it going to change anything?\u201d</p><p>T\u2019Challa slowly shook his head but proceeded to place the envelope on the kitchen counter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust say it was from work. A bonus,\u201d he said, looking at you to see if you understood. You stared in confusion and watched as he left the apartment, shutting the door quietly on his way out.\u00a0</p><p>Both you and Sam just stared at the money.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShould we take it?\u201d you asked, still fiddling with the bag in your pocket. Sam reached out to take the envelope and count it. With a silent scoff, he threw it back onto the counter and retreated to his room.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You cursed the end of this wonderful day and cursed the money. The one thing you needed most was right in front of you. By the looks of it, you could take that amount and leave the state to start over. But would you really do that to your friends?</p><p>With one last flip of the baggy in your pocket, you began to go to your room to sleep. The door opened to reveal Bucky returning, wet and dripping from the rain outside.\u00a0</p><p>It was quiet as you two stared at each other. He eyed the envelope and raised is eyebrows. You swallowed hard and spoke.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCigarette?\u201d</p><hr><p><b>A/N:</b> OH MY GOD, HI THERE!!!!!\u00a0 I MISSED YOU ALL!!!!!! I\u2019M BACK!!!!!

Thanks very much.\u201d</i></p><p><i>With his legs comfortably crossed and his shoulder draped with a small hotel towel, Sam breathed in the warm and humid air of Puerto Vallarta.\u00a0 It was much thicker than the air in Cuba, much warmer than the air in South Korea, and much more relaxing than the air in Los Angeles. Perhaps it felt\u00a0\u2018much better\u2019 simply because he finally left his long-term girlfriend from high school, won $20,000 on the slots in Hong Kong, or because he was absolutely alone.\u00a0 Whatever it was, Sam sipped his brand-new sangria as he pondered the options. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Traveling wasn\u2019t all glamour and big bucks. It took connections and some great taste in all things expensive. It didn\u2019t make much difference to Sam if he was rich or poor. He was enjoying the freedom.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>If Sam was questioned about it, he would claim he traveled better alone, experienced things with a greater mind that way. If it were up to him, he would only speak to another human being when needed. But he didn\u2019t have to- not when everything was so perfect.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It was obviously some much needed\u00a0\u2018alone time\u2019 after such an abrupt end to yet another strong relationship, but that\u2019s what was foreshadowed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He would never admit it to anyone yet and probably would always keep it locked away in the confines of his chest, growing and expanding. He would never find peace with himself, no matter how many times he sipped on delicious drinks and got the accurate daily dose of vitamin D.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He was extremely close to coming out to Dylan, the pool boy for his second cousin in England. He got close to telling Phil, the nice and rhythmic Jamaican that lived in the apartment next to his one summer. Sam had even told the fireman in France that he was \u2018 heating up in places he shouldn\u2019t be\u2019, but quickly averted that awkward conversation to pointing at his neck and the oxygen tank instead. Sam almost mentioned it once or twice to Steve but decided against it- he, himself, simply wasn\u2019t ready.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>So, Sam quickly packed his suitcase and left a lovely, hand-written note to his latest love, Dave. Carefully placing the note in-between Dave\u2019s medication and the cup of water on his nightstand, Sam debated once more.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>A kiss goodbye? Should he just not leave?</i></p><p><i>Maybe he\u2019d stay and tear the note and switch to\u00a0\u2018loving boyfriend\u2019 mode and make Dave\u2019s studio apartment smell like those burnt pancakes he loves so much. Or maybe Sam could visit Venice, Italy- he had never been there.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Sam eventually went with the second option, like always, and left the apartment with a glum expression and an even tighter chest than before.\u00a0</i></p><hr><p><b>THREE YEARS LATER</b></p><p><b></b>\u201cHow\u2019s the couch treating yuh?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s little quip almost ruined Bucky\u2019s morning, but after breathing in the cool, Christmas morning air he quickly kicked off the three blankets with a happy look on his face. All red nosed and tangled curls sitting on top of his head, Bucky simply stuck his tongue out Sam and walked past him to start the coffee for five people.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fantastic, actually. How was your night?\u201d Bucky replied.\u00a0</p><p>Sam raised his eyebrows for a couple of seconds, but quickly set them down when he realized Bucky was only trying to fit into the holiday morning. Just the other night Bucky had almost blown someone\u2019s head off and today he was actually trying to act less frightened.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI slept great as well,\u201d Sam smiled, gently clapping the table once and made his way to the balcony. Steve had been there for about fifteen minutes before Sam had woken, enjoying the morning breeze.\u00a0</p><p>The sound of the window creaking open snapped Steve from his original gaze and landed on Sam instead.\u00a0 Sam raised his hands as an apology for the harsh sound but moved to stand next to his best friend. The two stood for a couple minutes without a sound, listening to the calmness of Brooklyn before people began getting up to start the Christmas day. By the time the fourth bird sang its song, Sam gently shoved Steve\u2019s shoulder to alert him of his morning greeting.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled as a reply, a quiet sigh exiting his nose followed by a breeze of cold air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI hope you weren\u2019t expecting a Christmas present. But I think my presence is enough. So, it counts.\u201d</p><p>It was Steve\u2019s turn to shove Sam to the side. Steve hugged the blanket tighter to his body and once he noticed Sam wore no warm cover, he suggested they head back inside.\u00a0\u201cAs much as this morning calms me, I think we should freeze inside the building instead.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded in agreement, following the tall blonde through the creaking window. As they stepped back into the living room, you had emerged in your\u00a0\u2018angel\u2019 uniform. It\u2019s description could be kept short considering Steve had already scanned every single detail during your first encounter. But the diamonds and white silk still made him weak in the knees. Sam choked on his spit loudly, instantly covering himself with the same blanket Steve was wrapped in. He squeezed himself against Steve and stared at you in astonishment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGirl, what are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>You chuckled, lugging your suitcase and large coat in both hands. You dropped them on the couch and did a slight twirl to your audience.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas.\u00a0 Perhaps one of the busiest days of the year. Besides Valentine\u2019s Day and Super Bowl Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Bucky had stopped pouring his coffee to stare at you in awe. He was quiet, deciding to listen to the conversation rather than intrude.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Sam whined, snuggling closer to Steve. Steve decided to join the dramatics, just in case you were to change your mind. He snuggled closer to Sam as well, and made a puppy-dog face to entice you with the idea of warmth. You rolled your eyes at the men and waved them off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the main set today. Tips will be flooding at the doorway, gentleman,\u201d you laughed and put on your oversized coat.\u00a0\u201cYou gotta learn from this hard-working woman.\u201d</p><p>Steve continued to shake his head,\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want some rent money or not?\u201d</p><p>Steve puckered his lips and raised his eyebrows in an exaggerated look of understanding.\u00a0\u201cCool, cool, cool, cool, cool. No doubt, no doubt, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you would ever want me to miss out on all the guilty dough from sad men celebrating Christmas in a strip club,\u201d you twirled again, this way making your way to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>Christmas, no matter how lonely it was in the mornings and the nights you returned, was always your biggest hit.\u00a0It was as if the momentary dancing and singing and money being thrown at you was enough to numb your pain for a long while. You had always made enough money to buy a new needle or alcohol. If you had dressed better than the months before, or danced greater, or showed a little more skin, the men always gave you enough to buy some more smack. \u00a0</p><p>But you had quit. You had thrown away all of your needles. You didn\u2019t have the temptation anymore. The more you worked, however, the more temptation would itch.</p><p>But this was for rent money. Something you were always behind on, anyway.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys come hang? There\u2019s nothing here to get you in the spirit,\u201d you laughed, grabbing yourself a styrofoam cup to pour some cream and coffee in.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky smiled as you twirled around him, still hesitant about interrupting a conversation.\u00a0</p><p>You stopped in front of him,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to make it to my set, right?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes widened slightly. He had seen you dance on his drunken nights in the city when he used to visit Steve, but never had he voluntarily watched while sober.</p><p>Sam answered instead,\u00a0\u201cUs? Watch you\u2026 strip?\u201d</p><p>For the second time that joyous morning, you rolled your eyes.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll probably see just a little nip slip. Don\u2019t worry too much about it.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled brightly, teeth showing and everything.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to be the loudest and grandest tipper there!\u201d</p><p>Your expression of delight turned into confusion.\u00a0\u201cWhy would you waste your money, when it\u2019s gonna go into my pocket, and then back into this apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sam sighed. After a few chuckles, the sound of the door unlocking caught everyone\u2019s attention. Peggy scurried inside with a tray of chocolate chip cookies and her\u00a0\u2018Best Cook\u2019 apron wrapped around her waist.\u00a0The four of you cheered and lunged at her, devouring her treats and locking her into the previous conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou gonna enjoy this miracle with us, Peggy?\u201d Steve asked, mouth full of cookie. Peggy smiled at him and handed him a tiny napkin.</p><p>\u201cSure! I appreciate any form of dance! Just ask Steve.\u201d</p><p>Sam grabbed his cup of black coffee and took a long sip before he replied to Peggy\u2019s comment.\u00a0\u201cYou managed to teach Steve something besides the sidestep?\u201d</p><hr><p>You quickly fixed your bra backstage, grinning at the constant muttering of the guys at the front of the stage. If you heard correctly, Bucky wanted to give the taxpayers their seats because they weren\u2019t going to throw anything anyway.\u00a0 And you briefly heard Steve say\u00a0\u2018shut the fuck up\u2019 once in a while.\u00a0</p><p>The girls backstage wished you luck, a wider smile than usual on all of their faces. As sad as it was, Christmas day brought more customers and with that, more money. With one final stretch of the arms, you walked onto the stage in the dark.\u00a0 A mic was strung from the back of your bra and through your hair, the tip reaching the beginning of your forehead. You held onto the pole as the drums started to pound and the lights brightened you up.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s the time? Well, it\u2019s gotta be close to midnight!\u201d</i><br></p><p>You danced and sang your heart out like you would any other day. Your voice vibrated off the walls beautifully and the men reacted like any straight man would be.\u00a0</p><p>You reached the end of the stage and rolled over on your stomach, extending your legs outwards and then rolled over onto your back.\u00a0 Pushing yourself up, you leaned out into the crowd and smiled at your new roommates. So engrossed in your little dance, they were simply staring at you and then the wall\u2026 then you\u2026 then the wall.\u00a0</p><p>To get the best tips possible and as a silent\u00a0<i>\u201cI got this\u201d </i>to your friends, you hit the floor once again. Belting and following rhythm, you ended up on your back once again. You had it, you certainly did as any of the boys would exclaim, when you lifted your legs into the air and unlocked them, spreading them wide open for the whole audience.\u00a0 A cheeky look was all it was and it gave you breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the whole apartment for three whole days.\u00a0</p><p>You wrapped up and headed back behind the curtain, wishing the next girl luck as you caught your breath.\u00a0</p><p>The girls were all acquaintances and you knew everyone\u2019s first and last name. There were no strangers. Every girl knew you and every girl spoke with Luke. It was a small community. However, no backstories were ever shared.\u00a0 No one knew how many siblings each person had or if they were sleeping under a roof every night. So, it would make sense that no one knew each other\u2019s past addictions. You stopped in your tracks as you saw a suspicious teenage boy hand a little baggy to one of the girls who had already performed. You swallowed hard and averted your eyes quickly, heading over to your table to grab your clothes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter,\u201d the girl muttered, wiping her nose in the process. The boy looked at the woman with a hint of sympathy before he nodded and slipped out the back door. She turned around and almost yelped when she saw you staring.\u00a0<br></p><p>She looked to the floor,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I, um\u2026 needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain anything to me,\u201d you smiled slightly. She nodded quickly and grabbed her purse, exiting the same back door.\u00a0</p><p>You could feel the itch in your throat and a headache aching to break through. Without a second thought, you ran to the back door and squinted at the afternoon light. She was gone and so was the itch. Almost.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNeed something?\u201d<br></p><p>You turned and saw the boy near the door smoking a cigarette. You cleared your throat uncomfortably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a little young to deal?\u201d<br></p><p>The boy chuckled,\u00a0\u201cHave to pay the bills in New York some way, right? I\u2019m guessing you understand completely.\u201d</p><p>His response was sort of backhanded but you ignored it. Instead, you left to reenter the building.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot gonna buy anything?\u201d<br></p><p>You stopped in your tracks, looking at his pale green eyes. You always knew a dealer\u2019s number one rule was to never try out the product. But you could tell her enjoyed it more than he should.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d you stuttered. It was then that you felt so cold, the afternoon air biting you in the face. Peter smiled and grabbed your arm quickly, making you jolt. You felt his hand slide into your jacket pocket and slide back out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFree handout.\u201d<br></p><p>Before you could reject, he sprinted down the alley and out of sight. You let out a heavy breath, feeling the unbelievable weight of the tiny bag.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Steve exited the bathroom after taking his medication, joining his friends at the kitchen table. Everyone was eating the takeout you had bought right after your set.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat blonde chick\u2026 ugh- I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t stop thinking about her,\u201d Peggy joked. You laughed and told Peggy her name, also adding that she was most likely single.\u00a0<br></p><p>Steve joined,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t go giving Peggy girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows and ate a mouthful of kung-pao chicken before speaking.\u00a0\u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Steve answered immediately,\u00a0\u201cBecause I think she\u2019s interested in someone else anyway.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes and saw Peggy\u2019s eyes leave Steve\u2019s to hide her blush. You chewed with your new found knowledge, deciding to change the subject.\u00a0\u201cSo, what did everyone think of the set?\u201d</p><p>Bucky answered first.\u00a0\u201cIt was surprisingly great.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed quietly,\u00a0\u201cSurprisingly?\u201d</p><p>Sam rolled his eyes and nudged your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cBucky meant the surprise in his jeans.\u201d</p><p>Bucky almost catapulted from his seat to pounce on Sam but he held himself together. He opted for a shy shake of the head instead. To save him as well, you brought your attention back to Sam.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Sam? Any girl catch your eye besides me? I could tell you loved me the most by how much fidgeting you were doing,\u201d you teased, lying about the last part.\u00a0\u201cI could always get someone\u2019s number.\u201d<br></p><p>Sam continued to eat his noodles,\u00a0\u201cNot really. You did great, of course.\u201d</p><hr><p>The room was filled with laughter for a couple more hours before nightfall came. Before everyone retreated back to their rooms and Peggy back to her apartment, Sam presented a number of bags from behind the couch. Everyone\u2019s mouth fell open.\u00a0</p><p>Steve almost let a tear slip.\u00a0\u201cSam, you didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Bucky also agreed with Steve,\u00a0\u201cYou really didn\u2019t. Dude\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sam raised the bags in the air,\u00a0\u201cYeah, yeah. But it\u2019s Christmas! Here\u2019s one for you\u2026\u201d</p><p>He handed a bag to everyone, including you. You looked at him in disbelief.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did you even have time?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know when the orange-haired chick had that ten minute set?\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone muttered in recognition.\u00a0\u201cYeah, I left for a good thirty minutes after she took the stage.\u201d</p><p>You snorted silently, covering your mouth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOpen them! Open them!\u201d<br></p><p>Steve went first, ripping the paper out from the bag and looking inside. He released a heavy sigh and pulled a first-aid kit.\u00a0\u201cWow, thanks. Just what I needed.\u201d</p><p>Sam brushed off Steve\u2019s silent muttering of the word\u00a0\u201cdick\u201d. Bucky opened his next, pulling out a new can of pepper spray. He scrunched his eyebrows and waited for Sam to explain.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, that shit\u2019s for when you wake up ready to kill us in the mornings.\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone shared a tiny chuckle and pushed back the memory of a gun in their face.\u00a0</p><p>You pulled the paper from your bag and found a bag of Doritos.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou need carbs. Okay! Peggy! You\u2019re last!\u201d You pushed your tongue to the roof of your mouth to restrain yourself from both beating Sam and laughing out loud.\u00a0</p><p>Peggy pulled a key from her bag. She pursed her lips and thought about what it could be for.\u00a0</p><p>Sam asked for it to show her. She handed the key to him and everyone watched as he went up to the front door, opened it, and locked and unlocked it from the front. Peggy\u2019s eyes widened, as did everyone else\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>Sam threw the key back at her,\u00a0\u201cWhenever you get too lonely, or want to see Steve or anyone one of us, which is highly unlikely.\u201d Steve just stood shaking his head at his best friend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr when you finally decide to move-in.\u201d<br></p><p>Peggy remained silent but threw herself at Sam and gave him a big hug. It was a grand gesture, one that no one was opposed to.\u00a0</p><p>And just like that, a nice moment was ruined when a knock at the door disturbed you. The face behind the door was not really unexpected, especially since he popped up out of nowhere all the time. If it wasn\u2019t for a packed apartment, Steve would have punched T\u2019Challa for ruining a nice night.\u00a0</p><p>Instead, T\u2019Challa stood and apologized for his presence right away.\u00a0\u201cI apologize for my showing. I just wanted to deliver the news instead of having a poster strung up on your door.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s heart fell. A slight ping pinched at his chest but the loud voices behind him made him forget about it. There was protesting already before T\u2019Challa had even delivered the news.\u00a0</p><p>T\u2019Challa stepped into the apartment and shut the door behind him. He waited until an opening in the argument allowed him to speak.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to tell you in person that I had to sign the contracts. But I promise that I will push this project as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scoffed,\u00a0\u201cSo, instead of kicking us out right away you want us to wait and wonder when all your pushing is going to finally fail?\u201d</p><p>It was silent. T\u2019Challa sighed and reached into his pocket. Before he could pull anything out, Steve stormed out with Bucky and Peggy following him.\u00a0</p><p>You and Sam stood in the middle of the kitchen awkwardly, looking at each other and back at T\u2019Challa. Sam looked T\u2019Challa up and down while you fiddled with the interior of your jacket pocket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere. Take it. Please,\u201d T\u2019Challa said, holding out an envelope that looked to be filled with money. Sam furrowed his eyebrows and continued to stare at T\u2019Challa.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou want us to take money from the one evicting us? Is it going to change anything?\u201d</p><p>T\u2019Challa slowly shook his head but proceeded to place the envelope on the kitchen counter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust say it was from work. A bonus,\u201d he said, looking at you to see if you understood. You stared in confusion and watched as he left the apartment, shutting the door quietly on his way out.\u00a0</p><p>Both you and Sam just stared at the money.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShould we take it?\u201d you asked, still fiddling with the bag in your pocket. Sam reached out to take the envelope and count it. With a silent scoff, he threw it back onto the counter and retreated to his room.\u00a0<br></p><p>You cursed the end of this wonderful day and cursed the money. The one thing you needed most was right in front of you. By the looks of it, you could take that amount and leave the state to start over. But would you really do that to your friends?</p><p>With one last flip of the baggy in your pocket, you began to go to your room to sleep. The door opened to reveal Bucky returning, wet and dripping from the rain outside.\u00a0</p><p>It was quiet as you two stared at each other. He eyed the envelope and raised is eyebrows. You swallowed hard and spoke.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCigarette?\u201d</p><hr><p><b>A/N:</b> OH MY GOD, HI THERE!!!!!\u00a0 I MISSED YOU ALL!!!!!! I\u2019M BACK!!!!!

Thanks very much.\u201d</i></p><p><i>With his legs comfortably crossed and his shoulder draped with a small hotel towel, Sam breathed in the warm and humid air of Puerto Vallarta.\u00a0 It was much thicker than the air in Cuba, much warmer than the air in South Korea, and much more relaxing than the air in Los Angeles. Perhaps it felt\u00a0\u2018much better\u2019 simply because he finally left his long-term girlfriend from high school, won $20,000 on the slots in Hong Kong, or because he was absolutely alone.\u00a0 Whatever it was, Sam sipped his brand-new sangria as he pondered the options. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Traveling wasn\u2019t all glamour and big bucks. It took connections and some great taste in all things expensive. It didn\u2019t make much difference to Sam if he was rich or poor. He was enjoying the freedom.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>If Sam was questioned about it, he would claim he traveled better alone, experienced things with a greater mind that way. If it were up to him, he would only speak to another human being when needed. But he didn\u2019t have to- not when everything was so perfect.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It was obviously some much needed\u00a0\u2018alone time\u2019 after such an abrupt end to yet another strong relationship, but that\u2019s what was foreshadowed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He would never admit it to anyone yet and probably would always keep it locked away in the confines of his chest, growing and expanding. He would never find peace with himself, no matter how many times he sipped on delicious drinks and got the accurate daily dose of vitamin D.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He was extremely close to coming out to Dylan, the pool boy for his second cousin in England. He got close to telling Phil, the nice and rhythmic Jamaican that lived in the apartment next to his one summer. Sam had even told the fireman in France that he was \u2018 heating up in places he shouldn\u2019t be\u2019, but quickly averted that awkward conversation to pointing at his neck and the oxygen tank instead. Sam almost mentioned it once or twice to Steve but decided against it- he, himself, simply wasn\u2019t ready.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>So, Sam quickly packed his suitcase and left a lovely, hand-written note to his latest love, Dave. Carefully placing the note in-between Dave\u2019s medication and the cup of water on his nightstand, Sam debated once more.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>A kiss goodbye? Should he just not leave?</i></p><p><i>Maybe he\u2019d stay and tear the note and switch to\u00a0\u2018loving boyfriend\u2019 mode and make Dave\u2019s studio apartment smell like those burnt pancakes he loves so much. Or maybe Sam could visit Venice, Italy- he had never been there.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Sam eventually went with the second option, like always, and left the apartment with a glum expression and an even tighter chest than before.\u00a0</i></p><hr><p><b>THREE YEARS LATER</b></p><p><b></b>\u201cHow\u2019s the couch treating yuh?\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s little quip almost ruined Bucky\u2019s morning, but after breathing in the cool, Christmas morning air he quickly kicked off the three blankets with a happy look on his face. All red nosed and tangled curls sitting on top of his head, Bucky simply stuck his tongue out Sam and walked past him to start the coffee for five people.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fantastic, actually. How was your night?\u201d Bucky replied.\u00a0</p><p>Sam raised his eyebrows for a couple of seconds, but quickly set them down when he realized Bucky was only trying to fit into the holiday morning. Just the other night Bucky had almost blown someone\u2019s head off and today he was actually trying to act less frightened.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI slept great as well,\u201d Sam smiled, gently clapping the table once and made his way to the balcony. Steve had been there for about fifteen minutes before Sam had woken, enjoying the morning breeze.\u00a0</p><p>The sound of the window creaking open snapped Steve from his original gaze and landed on Sam instead.\u00a0 Sam raised his hands as an apology for the harsh sound but moved to stand next to his best friend. The two stood for a couple minutes without a sound, listening to the calmness of Brooklyn before people began getting up to start the Christmas day. By the time the fourth bird sang its song, Sam gently shoved Steve\u2019s shoulder to alert him of his morning greeting.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled as a reply, a quiet sigh exiting his nose followed by a breeze of cold air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI hope you weren\u2019t expecting a Christmas present. But I think my presence is enough. So, it counts.\u201d</p><p>It was Steve\u2019s turn to shove Sam to the side. Steve hugged the blanket tighter to his body and once he noticed Sam wore no warm cover, he suggested they head back inside.\u00a0\u201cAs much as this morning calms me, I think we should freeze inside the building instead.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded in agreement, following the tall blonde through the creaking window. As they stepped back into the living room, you had emerged in your\u00a0\u2018angel\u2019 uniform. It\u2019s description could be kept short considering Steve had already scanned every single detail during your first encounter. But the diamonds and white silk still made him weak in the knees. Sam choked on his spit loudly, instantly covering himself with the same blanket Steve was wrapped in. He squeezed himself against Steve and stared at you in astonishment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGirl, what are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>You chuckled, lugging your suitcase and large coat in both hands. You dropped them on the couch and did a slight twirl to your audience.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas.\u00a0 Perhaps one of the busiest days of the year. Besides Valentine\u2019s Day and Super Bowl Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Bucky had stopped pouring his coffee to stare at you in awe. He was quiet, deciding to listen to the conversation rather than intrude.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Sam whined, snuggling closer to Steve. Steve decided to join the dramatics, just in case you were to change your mind. He snuggled closer to Sam as well, and made a puppy-dog face to entice you with the idea of warmth. You rolled your eyes at the men and waved them off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the main set today. Tips will be flooding at the doorway, gentleman,\u201d you laughed and put on your oversized coat.\u00a0\u201cYou gotta learn from this hard-working woman.\u201d</p><p>Steve continued to shake his head,\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want some rent money or not?\u201d</p><p>Steve puckered his lips and raised his eyebrows in an exaggerated look of understanding.\u00a0\u201cCool, cool, cool, cool, cool. No doubt, no doubt, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you would ever want me to miss out on all the guilty dough from sad men celebrating Christmas in a strip club,\u201d you twirled again, this way making your way to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>Christmas, no matter how lonely it was in the mornings and the nights you returned, was always your biggest hit.\u00a0It was as if the momentary dancing and singing and money being thrown at you was enough to numb your pain for a long while. You had always made enough money to buy a new needle or alcohol. If you had dressed better than the months before, or danced greater, or showed a little more skin, the men always gave you enough to buy some more smack. \u00a0</p><p>But you had quit. You had thrown away all of your needles. You didn\u2019t have the temptation anymore. The more you worked, however, the more temptation would itch.</p><p>But this was for rent money. Something you were always behind on, anyway.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys come hang? There\u2019s nothing here to get you in the spirit,\u201d you laughed, grabbing yourself a styrofoam cup to pour some cream and coffee in.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky smiled as you twirled around him, still hesitant about interrupting a conversation.\u00a0</p><p>You stopped in front of him,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to make it to my set, right?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes widened slightly. He had seen you dance on his drunken nights in the city when he used to visit Steve, but never had he voluntarily watched while sober.</p><p>Sam answered instead,\u00a0\u201cUs? Watch you\u2026 strip?\u201d</p><p>For the second time that joyous morning, you rolled your eyes.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll probably see just a little nip slip. Don\u2019t worry too much about it.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled brightly, teeth showing and everything.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to be the loudest and grandest tipper there!\u201d</p><p>Your expression of delight turned into confusion.\u00a0\u201cWhy would you waste your money, when it\u2019s gonna go into my pocket, and then back into this apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sam sighed. After a few chuckles, the sound of the door unlocking caught everyone\u2019s attention. Peggy scurried inside with a tray of chocolate chip cookies and her\u00a0\u2018Best Cook\u2019 apron wrapped around her waist.\u00a0The four of you cheered and lunged at her, devouring her treats and locking her into the previous conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou gonna enjoy this miracle with us, Peggy?\u201d Steve asked, mouth full of cookie. Peggy smiled at him and handed him a tiny napkin.</p><p>\u201cSure! I appreciate any form of dance! Just ask Steve.\u201d</p><p>Sam grabbed his cup of black coffee and took a long sip before he replied to Peggy\u2019s comment.\u00a0\u201cYou managed to teach Steve something besides the sidestep?\u201d</p><hr><p>You quickly fixed your bra backstage, grinning at the constant muttering of the guys at the front of the stage. If you heard correctly, Bucky wanted to give the taxpayers their seats because they weren\u2019t going to throw anything anyway.\u00a0 And you briefly heard Steve say\u00a0\u2018shut the fuck up\u2019 once in a while.\u00a0</p><p>The girls backstage wished you luck, a wider smile than usual on all of their faces. As sad as it was, Christmas day brought more customers and with that, more money. With one final stretch of the arms, you walked onto the stage in the dark.\u00a0 A mic was strung from the back of your bra and through your hair, the tip reaching the beginning of your forehead. You held onto the pole as the drums started to pound and the lights brightened you up.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s the time? Well, it\u2019s gotta be close to midnight!\u201d</i><br></p><p>You danced and sang your heart out like you would any other day. Your voice vibrated off the walls beautifully and the men reacted like any straight man would be.\u00a0</p><p>You reached the end of the stage and rolled over on your stomach, extending your legs outwards and then rolled over onto your back.\u00a0 Pushing yourself up, you leaned out into the crowd and smiled at your new roommates. So engrossed in your little dance, they were simply staring at you and then the wall\u2026 then you\u2026 then the wall.\u00a0</p><p>To get the best tips possible and as a silent\u00a0<i>\u201cI got this\u201d </i>to your friends, you hit the floor once again. Belting and following rhythm, you ended up on your back once again. You had it, you certainly did as any of the boys would exclaim, when you lifted your legs into the air and unlocked them, spreading them wide open for the whole audience.\u00a0 A cheeky look was all it was and it gave you breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the whole apartment for three whole days.\u00a0</p><p>You wrapped up and headed back behind the curtain, wishing the next girl luck as you caught your breath.\u00a0</p><p>The girls were all acquaintances and you knew everyone\u2019s first and last name. There were no strangers. Every girl knew you and every girl spoke with Luke. It was a small community. However, no backstories were ever shared.\u00a0 No one knew how many siblings each person had or if they were sleeping under a roof every night. So, it would make sense that no one knew each other\u2019s past addictions. You stopped in your tracks as you saw a suspicious teenage boy hand a little baggy to one of the girls who had already performed. You swallowed hard and averted your eyes quickly, heading over to your table to grab your clothes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter,\u201d the girl muttered, wiping her nose in the process. The boy looked at the woman with a hint of sympathy before he nodded and slipped out the back door. She turned around and almost yelped when she saw you staring.\u00a0<br></p><p>She looked to the floor,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I, um\u2026 needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain anything to me,\u201d you smiled slightly. She nodded quickly and grabbed her purse, exiting the same back door.\u00a0</p><p>You could feel the itch in your throat and a headache aching to break through. Without a second thought, you ran to the back door and squinted at the afternoon light. She was gone and so was the itch. Almost.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNeed something?\u201d<br></p><p>You turned and saw the boy near the door smoking a cigarette. You cleared your throat uncomfortably.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a little young to deal?\u201d<br></p><p>The boy chuckled,\u00a0\u201cHave to pay the bills in New York some way, right? I\u2019m guessing you understand completely.\u201d</p><p>His response was sort of backhanded but you ignored it. Instead, you left to reenter the building.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot gonna buy anything?\u201d<br></p><p>You stopped in your tracks, looking at his pale green eyes. You always knew a dealer\u2019s number one rule was to never try out the product. But you could tell her enjoyed it more than he should.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d you stuttered. It was then that you felt so cold, the afternoon air biting you in the face. Peter smiled and grabbed your arm quickly, making you jolt. You felt his hand slide into your jacket pocket and slide back out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFree handout.\u201d<br></p><p>Before you could reject, he sprinted down the alley and out of sight. You let out a heavy breath, feeling the unbelievable weight of the tiny bag.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Steve exited the bathroom after taking his medication, joining his friends at the kitchen table. Everyone was eating the takeout you had bought right after your set.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat blonde chick\u2026 ugh- I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t stop thinking about her,\u201d Peggy joked. You laughed and told Peggy her name, also adding that she was most likely single.\u00a0<br></p><p>Steve joined,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t go giving Peggy girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows and ate a mouthful of kung-pao chicken before speaking.\u00a0\u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Steve answered immediately,\u00a0\u201cBecause I think she\u2019s interested in someone else anyway.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes and saw Peggy\u2019s eyes leave Steve\u2019s to hide her blush. You chewed with your new found knowledge, deciding to change the subject.\u00a0\u201cSo, what did everyone think of the set?\u201d</p><p>Bucky answered first.\u00a0\u201cIt was surprisingly great.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed quietly,\u00a0\u201cSurprisingly?\u201d</p><p>Sam rolled his eyes and nudged your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cBucky meant the surprise in his jeans.\u201d</p><p>Bucky almost catapulted from his seat to pounce on Sam but he held himself together. He opted for a shy shake of the head instead. To save him as well, you brought your attention back to Sam.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Sam? Any girl catch your eye besides me? I could tell you loved me the most by how much fidgeting you were doing,\u201d you teased, lying about the last part.\u00a0\u201cI could always get someone\u2019s number.\u201d<br></p><p>Sam continued to eat his noodles,\u00a0\u201cNot really. You did great, of course.\u201d</p><hr><p>The room was filled with laughter for a couple more hours before nightfall came. Before everyone retreated back to their rooms and Peggy back to her apartment, Sam presented a number of bags from behind the couch. Everyone\u2019s mouth fell open.\u00a0</p><p>Steve almost let a tear slip.\u00a0\u201cSam, you didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Bucky also agreed with Steve,\u00a0\u201cYou really didn\u2019t. Dude\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sam raised the bags in the air,\u00a0\u201cYeah, yeah. But it\u2019s Christmas! Here\u2019s one for you\u2026\u201d</p><p>He handed a bag to everyone, including you. You looked at him in disbelief.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did you even have time?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know when the orange-haired chick had that ten minute set?\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone muttered in recognition.\u00a0\u201cYeah, I left for a good thirty minutes after she took the stage.\u201d</p><p>You snorted silently, covering your mouth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOpen them! Open them!\u201d<br></p><p>Steve went first, ripping the paper out from the bag and looking inside. He released a heavy sigh and pulled a first-aid kit.\u00a0\u201cWow, thanks. Just what I needed.\u201d</p><p>Sam brushed off Steve\u2019s silent muttering of the word\u00a0\u201cdick\u201d. Bucky opened his next, pulling out a new can of pepper spray. He scrunched his eyebrows and waited for Sam to explain.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, that shit\u2019s for when you wake up ready to kill us in the mornings.\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone shared a tiny chuckle and pushed back the memory of a gun in their face.\u00a0</p><p>You pulled the paper from your bag and found a bag of Doritos.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou need carbs. Okay! Peggy! You\u2019re last!\u201d You pushed your tongue to the roof of your mouth to restrain yourself from both beating Sam and laughing out loud.\u00a0</p><p>Peggy pulled a key from her bag. She pursed her lips and thought about what it could be for.\u00a0</p><p>Sam asked for it to show her. She handed the key to him and everyone watched as he went up to the front door, opened it, and locked and unlocked it from the front. Peggy\u2019s eyes widened, as did everyone else\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>Sam threw the key back at her,\u00a0\u201cWhenever you get too lonely, or want to see Steve or anyone one of us, which is highly unlikely.\u201d Steve just stood shaking his head at his best friend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr when you finally decide to move-in.\u201d<br></p><p>Peggy remained silent but threw herself at Sam and gave him a big hug. It was a grand gesture, one that no one was opposed to.\u00a0</p><p>And just like that, a nice moment was ruined when a knock at the door disturbed you. The face behind the door was not really unexpected, especially since he popped up out of nowhere all the time. If it wasn\u2019t for a packed apartment, Steve would have punched T\u2019Challa for ruining a nice night.\u00a0</p><p>Instead, T\u2019Challa stood and apologized for his presence right away.\u00a0\u201cI apologize for my showing. I just wanted to deliver the news instead of having a poster strung up on your door.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s heart fell. A slight ping pinched at his chest but the loud voices behind him made him forget about it. There was protesting already before T\u2019Challa had even delivered the news.\u00a0</p><p>T\u2019Challa stepped into the apartment and shut the door behind him. He waited until an opening in the argument allowed him to speak.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to tell you in person that I had to sign the contracts. But I promise that I will push this project as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scoffed,\u00a0\u201cSo, instead of kicking us out right away you want us to wait and wonder when all your pushing is going to finally fail?\u201d</p><p>It was silent. T\u2019Challa sighed and reached into his pocket. Before he could pull anything out, Steve stormed out with Bucky and Peggy following him.\u00a0</p><p>You and Sam stood in the middle of the kitchen awkwardly, looking at each other and back at T\u2019Challa. Sam looked T\u2019Challa up and down while you fiddled with the interior of your jacket pocket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere. Take it. Please,\u201d T\u2019Challa said, holding out an envelope that looked to be filled with money. Sam furrowed his eyebrows and continued to stare at T\u2019Challa.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou want us to take money from the one evicting us? Is it going to change anything?\u201d</p><p>T\u2019Challa slowly shook his head but proceeded to place the envelope on the kitchen counter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust say it was from work. A bonus,\u201d he said, looking at you to see if you understood. You stared in confusion and watched as he left the apartment, shutting the door quietly on his way out.\u00a0</p><p>Both you and Sam just stared at the money.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShould we take it?\u201d you asked, still fiddling with the bag in your pocket. Sam reached out to take the envelope and count it. With a silent scoff, he threw it back onto the counter and retreated to his room.\u00a0<br></p><p>You cursed the end of this wonderful day and cursed the money. The one thing you needed most was right in front of you. By the looks of it, you could take that amount and leave the state to start over. But would you really do that to your friends?</p><p>With one last flip of the baggy in your pocket, you began to go to your room to sleep. The door opened to reveal Bucky returning, wet and dripping from the rain outside.\u00a0</p><p>It was quiet as you two stared at each other. He eyed the envelope and raised is eyebrows. You swallowed hard and spoke.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCigarette?\u201d</p><hr><p><b>A/N:</b> OH MY GOD, HI THERE!!!!!\u00a0 I MISSED YOU ALL!!!!!! I\u2019M BACK!!!!!

Thanks very much.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>With his legs comfortably crossed and his shoulder draped with a small hotel towel, Sam breathed in the warm and humid air of Puerto Vallarta.&nbsp; It was much thicker than the air in Cuba, much warmer than the air in South Korea, and much more relaxing than the air in Los Angeles. Perhaps it felt&nbsp;&lsquo;much better&rsquo; simply because he finally left his long-term girlfriend from high school, won $20,000 on the slots in Hong Kong, or because he was absolutely alone.&nbsp; Whatever it was, Sam sipped his brand-new sangria as he pondered the options. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Traveling wasn&rsquo;t all glamour and big bucks. It took connections and some great taste in all things expensive. It didn&rsquo;t make much difference to Sam if he was rich or poor. He was enjoying the freedom.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>If Sam was questioned about it, he would claim he traveled better alone, experienced things with a greater mind that way. If it were up to him, he would only speak to another human being when needed. But he didn&rsquo;t have to- not when everything was so perfect.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>It was obviously some much needed&nbsp;&lsquo;alone time&rsquo; after such an abrupt end to yet another strong relationship, but that&rsquo;s what was foreshadowed.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He would never admit it to anyone yet and probably would always keep it locked away in the confines of his chest, growing and expanding. He would never find peace with himself, no matter how many times he sipped on delicious drinks and got the accurate daily dose of vitamin D.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He was extremely close to coming out to Dylan, the pool boy for his second cousin in England. He got close to telling Phil, the nice and rhythmic Jamaican that lived in the apartment next to his one summer. Sam had even told the fireman in France that he was &lsquo; heating up in places he shouldn&rsquo;t be&rsquo;, but quickly averted that awkward conversation to pointing at his neck and the oxygen tank instead. Sam almost mentioned it once or twice to Steve but decided against it- he, himself, simply wasn&rsquo;t ready.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>So, Sam quickly packed his suitcase and left a lovely, hand-written note to his latest love, Dave. Carefully placing the note in-between Dave&rsquo;s medication and the cup of water on his nightstand, Sam debated once more.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>A kiss goodbye? Should he just not leave?</i></p><p><i>Maybe he&rsquo;d stay and tear the note and switch to&nbsp;&lsquo;loving boyfriend&rsquo; mode and make Dave&rsquo;s studio apartment smell like those burnt pancakes he loves so much. Or maybe Sam could visit Venice, Italy- he had never been there.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Sam eventually went with the second option, like always, and left the apartment with a glum expression and an even tighter chest than before.&nbsp;</i></p><hr /><p><b>THREE YEARS LATER</b></p><p><b></b>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the couch treating yuh?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam&rsquo;s little quip almost ruined Bucky&rsquo;s morning, but after breathing in the cool, Christmas morning air he quickly kicked off the three blankets with a happy look on his face. All red nosed and tangled curls sitting on top of his head, Bucky simply stuck his tongue out Sam and walked past him to start the coffee for five people.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing fantastic, actually. How was your night?&rdquo; Bucky replied.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam raised his eyebrows for a couple of seconds, but quickly set them down when he realized Bucky was only trying to fit into the holiday morning. Just the other night Bucky had almost blown someone&rsquo;s head off and today he was actually trying to act less frightened.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I slept great as well,&rdquo; Sam smiled, gently clapping the table once and made his way to the balcony. Steve had been there for about fifteen minutes before Sam had woken, enjoying the morning breeze.&nbsp;</p><p>The sound of the window creaking open snapped Steve from his original gaze and landed on Sam instead.&nbsp; Sam raised his hands as an apology for the harsh sound but moved to stand next to his best friend. The two stood for a couple minutes without a sound, listening to the calmness of Brooklyn before people began getting up to start the Christmas day. By the time the fourth bird sang its song, Sam gently shoved Steve&rsquo;s shoulder to alert him of his morning greeting.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled as a reply, a quiet sigh exiting his nose followed by a breeze of cold air.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you weren&rsquo;t expecting a Christmas present. But I think my presence is enough. So, it counts.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Steve&rsquo;s turn to shove Sam to the side. Steve hugged the blanket tighter to his body and once he noticed Sam wore no warm cover, he suggested they head back inside.&nbsp;&ldquo;As much as this morning calms me, I think we should freeze inside the building instead.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam nodded in agreement, following the tall blonde through the creaking window. As they stepped back into the living room, you had emerged in your&nbsp;&lsquo;angel&rsquo; uniform. It&rsquo;s description could be kept short considering Steve had already scanned every single detail during your first encounter. But the diamonds and white silk still made him weak in the knees. Sam choked on his spit loudly, instantly covering himself with the same blanket Steve was wrapped in. He squeezed himself against Steve and stared at you in astonishment.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Girl, what are you wearing?&rdquo;</p><p>You chuckled, lugging your suitcase and large coat in both hands. You dropped them on the couch and did a slight twirl to your audience.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Christmas.&nbsp; Perhaps one of the busiest days of the year. Besides Valentine&rsquo;s Day and Super Bowl Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky had stopped pouring his coffee to stare at you in awe. He was quiet, deciding to listen to the conversation rather than intrude.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; it&rsquo;s Christmas,&rdquo; Sam whined, snuggling closer to Steve. Steve decided to join the dramatics, just in case you were to change your mind. He snuggled closer to Sam as well, and made a puppy-dog face to entice you with the idea of warmth. You rolled your eyes at the men and waved them off.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the main set today. Tips will be flooding at the doorway, gentleman,&rdquo; you laughed and put on your oversized coat.&nbsp;&ldquo;You gotta learn from this hard-working woman.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve continued to shake his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want some rent money or not?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve puckered his lips and raised his eyebrows in an exaggerated look of understanding.&nbsp;&ldquo;Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. No doubt, no doubt, no doubt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy if you would ever want me to miss out on all the guilty dough from sad men celebrating Christmas in a strip club,&rdquo; you twirled again, this way making your way to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>Christmas, no matter how lonely it was in the mornings and the nights you returned, was always your biggest hit.&nbsp;It was as if the momentary dancing and singing and money being thrown at you was enough to numb your pain for a long while. You had always made enough money to buy a new needle or alcohol. If you had dressed better than the months before, or danced greater, or showed a little more skin, the men always gave you enough to buy some more smack. &nbsp;</p><p>But you had quit. You had thrown away all of your needles. You didn&rsquo;t have the temptation anymore. The more you worked, however, the more temptation would itch.</p><p>But this was for rent money. Something you were always behind on, anyway.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you guys come hang? There&rsquo;s nothing here to get you in the spirit,&rdquo; you laughed, grabbing yourself a styrofoam cup to pour some cream and coffee in.&nbsp;</p><p>Bucky smiled as you twirled around him, still hesitant about interrupting a conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>You stopped in front of him,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to make it to my set, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly. He had seen you dance on his drunken nights in the city when he used to visit Steve, but never had he voluntarily watched while sober.</p><p>Sam answered instead,&nbsp;&ldquo;Us? Watch you&hellip; strip?&rdquo;</p><p>For the second time that joyous morning, you rolled your eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably see just a little nip slip. Don&rsquo;t worry too much about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam smiled brightly, teeth showing and everything.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure to be the loudest and grandest tipper there!&rdquo;</p><p>Your expression of delight turned into confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why would you waste your money, when it&rsquo;s gonna go into my pocket, and then back into this apartment?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Sam sighed. After a few chuckles, the sound of the door unlocking caught everyone&rsquo;s attention. Peggy scurried inside with a tray of chocolate chip cookies and her&nbsp;&lsquo;Best Cook&rsquo; apron wrapped around her waist.&nbsp;The four of you cheered and lunged at her, devouring her treats and locking her into the previous conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You gonna enjoy this miracle with us, Peggy?&rdquo; Steve asked, mouth full of cookie. Peggy smiled at him and handed him a tiny napkin.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure! I appreciate any form of dance! Just ask Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam grabbed his cup of black coffee and took a long sip before he replied to Peggy&rsquo;s comment.&nbsp;&ldquo;You managed to teach Steve something besides the sidestep?&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>You quickly fixed your bra backstage, grinning at the constant muttering of the guys at the front of the stage. If you heard correctly, Bucky wanted to give the taxpayers their seats because they weren&rsquo;t going to throw anything anyway.&nbsp; And you briefly heard Steve say&nbsp;&lsquo;shut the fuck up&rsquo; once in a while.&nbsp;</p><p>The girls backstage wished you luck, a wider smile than usual on all of their faces. As sad as it was, Christmas day brought more customers and with that, more money. With one final stretch of the arms, you walked onto the stage in the dark.&nbsp; A mic was strung from the back of your bra and through your hair, the tip reaching the beginning of your forehead. You held onto the pole as the drums started to pound and the lights brightened you up.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the time? Well, it&rsquo;s gotta be close to midnight!&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>You danced and sang your heart out like you would any other day. Your voice vibrated off the walls beautifully and the men reacted like any straight man would be.&nbsp;</p><p>You reached the end of the stage and rolled over on your stomach, extending your legs outwards and then rolled over onto your back.&nbsp; Pushing yourself up, you leaned out into the crowd and smiled at your new roommates. So engrossed in your little dance, they were simply staring at you and then the wall&hellip; then you&hellip; then the wall.&nbsp;</p><p>To get the best tips possible and as a silent&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;I got this&rdquo; </i>to your friends, you hit the floor once again. Belting and following rhythm, you ended up on your back once again. You had it, you certainly did as any of the boys would exclaim, when you lifted your legs into the air and unlocked them, spreading them wide open for the whole audience.&nbsp; A cheeky look was all it was and it gave you breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the whole apartment for three whole days.&nbsp;</p><p>You wrapped up and headed back behind the curtain, wishing the next girl luck as you caught your breath.&nbsp;</p><p>The girls were all acquaintances and you knew everyone&rsquo;s first and last name. There were no strangers. Every girl knew you and every girl spoke with Luke. It was a small community. However, no backstories were ever shared.&nbsp; No one knew how many siblings each person had or if they were sleeping under a roof every night. So, it would make sense that no one knew each other&rsquo;s past addictions. You stopped in your tracks as you saw a suspicious teenage boy hand a little baggy to one of the girls who had already performed. You swallowed hard and averted your eyes quickly, heading over to your table to grab your clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Peter,&rdquo; the girl muttered, wiping her nose in the process. The boy looked at the woman with a hint of sympathy before he nodded and slipped out the back door. She turned around and almost yelped when she saw you staring.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She looked to the floor,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I, um&hellip; needed it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to explain anything to me,&rdquo; you smiled slightly. She nodded quickly and grabbed her purse, exiting the same back door.&nbsp;</p><p>You could feel the itch in your throat and a headache aching to break through. Without a second thought, you ran to the back door and squinted at the afternoon light. She was gone and so was the itch. Almost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Need something?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You turned and saw the boy near the door smoking a cigarette. You cleared your throat uncomfortably.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little young to deal?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The boy chuckled,&nbsp;&ldquo;Have to pay the bills in New York some way, right? I&rsquo;m guessing you understand completely.&rdquo;</p><p>His response was sort of backhanded but you ignored it. Instead, you left to reenter the building.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not gonna buy anything?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You stopped in your tracks, looking at his pale green eyes. You always knew a dealer&rsquo;s number one rule was to never try out the product. But you could tell her enjoyed it more than he should.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested,&rdquo; you stuttered. It was then that you felt so cold, the afternoon air biting you in the face. Peter smiled and grabbed your arm quickly, making you jolt. You felt his hand slide into your jacket pocket and slide back out.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Free handout.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Before you could reject, he sprinted down the alley and out of sight. You let out a heavy breath, feeling the unbelievable weight of the tiny bag.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Steve exited the bathroom after taking his medication, joining his friends at the kitchen table. Everyone was eating the takeout you had bought right after your set.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That blonde chick&hellip; ugh- I can&rsquo;t&hellip; I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about her,&rdquo; Peggy joked. You laughed and told Peggy her name, also adding that she was most likely single.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Steve joined,&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go giving Peggy girlfriends.&rdquo;</p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows and ate a mouthful of kung-pao chicken before speaking.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve answered immediately,&nbsp;&ldquo;Because I think she&rsquo;s interested in someone else anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes and saw Peggy&rsquo;s eyes leave Steve&rsquo;s to hide her blush. You chewed with your new found knowledge, deciding to change the subject.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, what did everyone think of the set?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky answered first.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was surprisingly great.&rdquo;</p><p>You scoffed quietly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Surprisingly?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam rolled his eyes and nudged your shoulder,&nbsp;&ldquo;Bucky meant the surprise in his jeans.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky almost catapulted from his seat to pounce on Sam but he held himself together. He opted for a shy shake of the head instead. To save him as well, you brought your attention back to Sam.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And what about you, Sam? Any girl catch your eye besides me? I could tell you loved me the most by how much fidgeting you were doing,&rdquo; you teased, lying about the last part.&nbsp;&ldquo;I could always get someone&rsquo;s number.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sam continued to eat his noodles,&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really. You did great, of course.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>The room was filled with laughter for a couple more hours before nightfall came. Before everyone retreated back to their rooms and Peggy back to her apartment, Sam presented a number of bags from behind the couch. Everyone&rsquo;s mouth fell open.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve almost let a tear slip.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sam, you didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky also agreed with Steve,&nbsp;&ldquo;You really didn&rsquo;t. Dude&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Sam raised the bags in the air,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. But it&rsquo;s Christmas! Here&rsquo;s one for you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He handed a bag to everyone, including you. You looked at him in disbelief.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you even have time?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know when the orange-haired chick had that ten minute set?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Everyone muttered in recognition.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I left for a good thirty minutes after she took the stage.&rdquo;</p><p>You snorted silently, covering your mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Open them! Open them!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve went first, ripping the paper out from the bag and looking inside. He released a heavy sigh and pulled a first-aid kit.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wow, thanks. Just what I needed.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam brushed off Steve&rsquo;s silent muttering of the word&nbsp;&ldquo;dick&rdquo;. Bucky opened his next, pulling out a new can of pepper spray. He scrunched his eyebrows and waited for Sam to explain.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that shit&rsquo;s for when you wake up ready to kill us in the mornings.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Everyone shared a tiny chuckle and pushed back the memory of a gun in their face.&nbsp;</p><p>You pulled the paper from your bag and found a bag of Doritos.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You need carbs. Okay! Peggy! You&rsquo;re last!&rdquo; You pushed your tongue to the roof of your mouth to restrain yourself from both beating Sam and laughing out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>Peggy pulled a key from her bag. She pursed her lips and thought about what it could be for.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam asked for it to show her. She handed the key to him and everyone watched as he went up to the front door, opened it, and locked and unlocked it from the front. Peggy&rsquo;s eyes widened, as did everyone else&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam threw the key back at her,&nbsp;&ldquo;Whenever you get too lonely, or want to see Steve or anyone one of us, which is highly unlikely.&rdquo; Steve just stood shaking his head at his best friend.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Or when you finally decide to move-in.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peggy remained silent but threw herself at Sam and gave him a big hug. It was a grand gesture, one that no one was opposed to.&nbsp;</p><p>And just like that, a nice moment was ruined when a knock at the door disturbed you. The face behind the door was not really unexpected, especially since he popped up out of nowhere all the time. If it wasn&rsquo;t for a packed apartment, Steve would have punched T&rsquo;Challa for ruining a nice night.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, T&rsquo;Challa stood and apologized for his presence right away.&nbsp;&ldquo;I apologize for my showing. I just wanted to deliver the news instead of having a poster strung up on your door.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s heart fell. A slight ping pinched at his chest but the loud voices behind him made him forget about it. There was protesting already before T&rsquo;Challa had even delivered the news.&nbsp;</p><p>T&rsquo;Challa stepped into the apartment and shut the door behind him. He waited until an opening in the argument allowed him to speak.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted to tell you in person that I had to sign the contracts. But I promise that I will push this project as much as I can.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky scoffed,&nbsp;&ldquo;So, instead of kicking us out right away you want us to wait and wonder when all your pushing is going to finally fail?&rdquo;</p><p>It was silent. T&rsquo;Challa sighed and reached into his pocket. Before he could pull anything out, Steve stormed out with Bucky and Peggy following him.&nbsp;</p><p>You and Sam stood in the middle of the kitchen awkwardly, looking at each other and back at T&rsquo;Challa. Sam looked T&rsquo;Challa up and down while you fiddled with the interior of your jacket pocket.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Here. Take it. Please,&rdquo; T&rsquo;Challa said, holding out an envelope that looked to be filled with money. Sam furrowed his eyebrows and continued to stare at T&rsquo;Challa.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You want us to take money from the one evicting us? Is it going to change anything?&rdquo;</p><p>T&rsquo;Challa slowly shook his head but proceeded to place the envelope on the kitchen counter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just say it was from work. A bonus,&rdquo; he said, looking at you to see if you understood. You stared in confusion and watched as he left the apartment, shutting the door quietly on his way out.&nbsp;</p><p>Both you and Sam just stared at the money.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Should we take it?&rdquo; you asked, still fiddling with the bag in your pocket. Sam reached out to take the envelope and count it. With a silent scoff, he threw it back onto the counter and retreated to his room.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You cursed the end of this wonderful day and cursed the money. The one thing you needed most was right in front of you. By the looks of it, you could take that amount and leave the state to start over. But would you really do that to your friends?</p><p>With one last flip of the baggy in your pocket, you began to go to your room to sleep. The door opened to reveal Bucky returning, wet and dripping from the rain outside.&nbsp;</p><p>It was quiet as you two stared at each other. He eyed the envelope and raised is eyebrows. You swallowed hard and spoke.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Cigarette?&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><b>A/N:</b> OH MY GOD, HI THERE!!!!!&nbsp; I MISSED YOU ALL!!!!!! I&rsquo;M BACK!!!!!
