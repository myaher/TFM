He likes to moisturise you, that&rsquo;s how aftercare works for the first three months. He blathers his hand in a thick moisturiser then run your own body. You&rsquo;ve never had softer skin in your own life. After those three months, he begins kissing and rubbing learning those soothe you a lot easier than rubbing liquid all over you.</p><p>B = Body part (Their favourite body part of theirs and also their partner\u2019s)</p><p>Draco likes your legs, the way they good, they are gorgeous, you enjoy swimming which means you naturally have nice legs, he could touch them all day. He likes his white blonde hair, everyone always compliments him on it, and it\u2019s slowly become his favourite. He likes it the most when your hands are tangled in it, whimpering as he desperately pleasures you.</p><p>C = Cum (Anything to do with cum basically.)</p><p>Draco believes there is only one place cum should belong, that&rsquo;s inside a woman, but when you expressed your worries he agreed that maybe it is early to risk a family. That&rsquo;s why he wears protection, to make you both happy, he gets to stay inside and your risk of pregnancy is a lot lower.</p><p>D = Dirty Secret (Pretty self-explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)</p><p>Draco likes to say he&rsquo;s been sleeping around, claims three girls in the same night, but you know it&rsquo;s only you. Draco is literally a blushing virgin when you get him alone, he buckled when you questioned him. He just wants to be cool, you two chatted and he promised to lie a little less. But the rumours are always going around.</p><p>E = Experience (How experienced are they? Do they know what they\u2019re doing?)</p><p>Draco has zero experiences, he didn&rsquo;t know where to put it on the first time, he then finished in about two minutes and you weren&rsquo;t very happy. But you love him so you trained his stamina and now he is pretty good, almost being an expert, he will happily take you on any surface, bed, table, floor, wall, door. There is no stopping him.</p><p>F = Favourite Position (This goes without saying. Will probably include a visual)</p><p>Draco likes to be in control, holding your hips and jerking into you, he&rsquo;s got to be on top, or free to move around. He has you on the edge of his bed most the time because he can&rsquo;t watch you kicking your legs around trying to get traction but he&rsquo;s in control. He may have some power play kinks going through his head. Don&rsquo;t tell him but you love it really.</p><p>G = Goofy (Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc)</p><p>Draco can accidentally be funny, but God help you if you laugh, he&rsquo;s in a foul mood for hours. The first time he was fingering you he found your cervix, \u201dwhat in Merlin&rsquo;s beard is this!\u201d Trying to poke it. And of course, you&rsquo;re helpless, laughing till the point of tears. Well, he stormed out in a huff, researched it in himself, but you couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing still.</p><p>H = Hair (How well groomed are they, does the carpet match the drapes, etc.)</p><p>Draco\u2019s carpet is lighter than his drapes, practically a glowing white, he doesn&rsquo;t like the thought of shaving so asked you to let it grow as well, you will trim to keep things in order. But Draco says it\u2019s more natural and nicer, he also claims it makes you look really hot as well.</p><p>I = Intimacy (How are they during the moment, romantic aspect\u2026)</p><p>Sex is often a stress relief, studying for exams is hard, romance doesn&rsquo;t often come into it, except on special occasions, birthday, Valentines, and good grades. Only then will he worship every inch of your body, kiss you and lick, leave love bites and tease, only then after you&rsquo;re begging with he make love to you in ways you didn\u2019t think Draco was comfortable with.</p><p>J = Jack Off (Masturbation headcanon)</p><p>Draco isn&rsquo;t great, he hasn&rsquo;t got a technique, the kind of jerks his hips and hopes it will all work out, which means it takes him twenty minutes which he normally gives up on and just ignores the problem.</p><p>K = Kink (One or more of their kinks)</p><p>Praise kink: he loves it, drives him crazy, telling him he is doing great, that he feels amazing stretching you out and that he&rsquo;s making you so happy, it\u2019s unreal has fast he will move his hips to make you keep saying those words.</p><p>Rope kink: seeing you tied up does something to him, watching how your hands struggle and how your body contours under the control of the rope, he can&rsquo;t handle himself, he feels ultimately in control.</p><p>L = Location (Favourite places to do the do)</p><p>To Draco Malfoy, every place is a good place to have sex. (eg. Snape&rsquo;s desk, Dumbledore\u2019s desk, Harry\u2019s bed, Ron\u2019s bed, grand hall, prefect bathrooms etc)</p><p>M = Motivation (What turns them on, gets them going)</p><p>Legs are a massive part of it for Draco, if you wear a skirt to class he is touching them under the desk, feeling the smooth skin and touching higher then he\u2019s meant too. When your confident, it gets him all sorts of aroused, when you stand up to Ron who\u2019s being an arse, he gets the largest erection going, when you beat him at duelling, that really gets him going. You barely make it out the classroom before he\u2019s trying to mount you. Your confidence makes you sexy and Draco likes when you\u2019re empowered.</p><p>N = NO (Something they wouldn\u2019t do, turn-offs)</p><p>Anything to do with death, he\u2019s already seen too much, it\u2019s terrible, he must protect you, it\u2019s vital, he goes through who rituals to protect you, follows you around like a puppy, sits with you at meals, he even tried to convince you to stop eating seafood. Apparently, it\u2019s very dangerous.</p><p>O = Oral (Preference for giving or receiving, skill, etc)</p><p>Draco loves to give you oral, he thinks its weird that someone would want to suck a penis, but him giving you oral is A-okay. He pulled your legs open, licks down your slit tasting you, and easy time you see a gorgeous fire burning in his eyes. He will gently suck on your clit, nibble your inner thigh, he&rsquo;s a master at it.</p><p>P = Pace (Are they fast and rough? Slow and sensual? etc.)</p><p>Generally, he&rsquo;s fast and rough, forcing all his stress out in a physical way, but on those few events, then he will make love to you all night long, kissing and gentle touches, Draco likes to be successful at everything he does, so unless you&rsquo;re fully satisfied he won&rsquo;t stop, you are priority number one.</p><p>Q = Quickie (Their opinions on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)</p><p>Yes, any way to relieve stress is something he wants to do, he also doesn&rsquo;t really care were it in, as long as he is inside you, giving you love, the caring he doesn&rsquo;t mind.</p><p>R = Risk (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)</p><p>With Draco, it isn&rsquo;t about the risk, it&rsquo;s about being desperate, he can&rsquo;t control himself, he will have do you where ever he is, but he is always careful, spells conceal the sound the two of you make just to make sure you&rsquo;re harder to catch in the act.</p><p>S = Stamina (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last\u2026)</p><p>For the first few times, he only lasted around five minutes before you started helping him, now he can last hours, he has found a good pattern, it offers you two pleasure and really is quite nice. You really don&rsquo;t mind that he needs it on a nightly basis, you skipped it one night and he was so uptight the next day he nearly killed Harry is potions.</p><p>T = Toy (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)</p><p>Draco was shy when it came to toys, never quite wanted to use them, but when he did, my God he loves them, his favourite is vibrators, he has you begging in minutes and that&rsquo;s what he wants.</p><p>U = Unfair (how much they like to tease)</p><p>Draco is often described as a bully, you&rsquo;d call him a bully after sex. During the rough stress relief, he hardly has time to tease you, but when you two are together and relaxing, he is all over you, teasing with licks and kisses and nibbled. There really is no stopping him.</p><p>V = Volume (How loud they are, what sounds they make)</p><p>Draco is more of a grunter then a moaner, he grunts about all sorts, sometimes he whimpers if he is really desperate, he is normally quiet, he&rsquo;s only noisy when you are really enjoying it. That forces his voice up, and sometimes he has to cast spells to hide the noise the two of you make.</p><p>W = Wild Card (Get a random headcanon for the character of your choice)</p><p>Condom: Draco was quite freaked out, the muggle invention described to catch semen and cum and all that stuff. He didn&rsquo;t trust them to begin with, got used to them, once he got used to them he loved them.</p><p>X = X-Ray (Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on in those pants, picture or words)</p><p>He has a nice girth, his length pretty average, but he knows what to do with his average, the flesh is so pale and soft, almost mesmerising.</p><p>Y = Yearning (How high is their sex drive?)</p><p>To begin with, Draco was finishing within five minutes and then looking at you confused. Now, however, he is all over you, three hours is his best record and he plans on breaking it in the holidays when he knows there are no distractions he devourers you mercilessly, and you love every minute.</p><p>Z = ZZZ (\u2026 how quickly they fall asleep afterwards)</p><p>Draco is a troubled sleeper, but after sex, he will hold you close, kiss your head as he talks about the happy memories he has and before you realise he&rsquo;s fast off to sleep, heads pressed together and tangled</p>",

He likes to moisturise you, that\u2019s how aftercare works for the first three months. He blathers his hand in a thick moisturiser then run your own body. You\u2019ve never had softer skin in your own life. After those three months, he begins kissing and rubbing learning those soothe you a lot easier than rubbing liquid all over you.</p><p>B = Body part (Their favourite body part of theirs and also their partner\u2019s)</p><p>Draco likes your legs, the way they good, they are gorgeous, you enjoy swimming which means you naturally have nice legs, he could touch them all day. He likes his white blonde hair, everyone always compliments him on it, and it\u2019s slowly become his favourite. He likes it the most when your hands are tangled in it, whimpering as he desperately pleasures you.</p><p>C = Cum (Anything to do with cum basically.)</p><p>Draco believes there is only one place cum should belong, that\u2019s inside a woman, but when you expressed your worries he agreed that maybe it is early to risk a family. That\u2019s why he wears protection, to make you both happy, he gets to stay inside and your risk of pregnancy is a lot lower.</p><p>D = Dirty Secret (Pretty self-explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)</p><p>Draco likes to say he\u2019s been sleeping around, claims three girls in the same night, but you know it\u2019s only you. Draco is literally a blushing virgin when you get him alone, he buckled when you questioned him. He just wants to be cool, you two chatted and he promised to lie a little less. But the rumours are always going around.</p><p>E = Experience (How experienced are they? Do they know what they\u2019re doing?)</p><p>Draco has zero experiences, he didn\u2019t know where to put it on the first time, he then finished in about two minutes and you weren\u2019t very happy. But you love him so you trained his stamina and now he is pretty good, almost being an expert, he will happily take you on any surface, bed, table, floor, wall, door. There is no stopping him.</p><p>F = Favourite Position (This goes without saying. Will probably include a visual)</p><p>Draco likes to be in control, holding your hips and jerking into you, he\u2019s got to be on top, or free to move around. He has you on the edge of his bed most the time because he can\u2019t watch you kicking your legs around trying to get traction but he\u2019s in control. He may have some power play kinks going through his head. Don\u2019t tell him but you love it really.</p><p>G = Goofy (Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc)</p><p>Draco can accidentally be funny, but God help you if you laugh, he\u2019s in a foul mood for hours. The first time he was fingering you he found your cervix, \u201dwhat in Merlin\u2019s beard is this!\u201d Trying to poke it. And of course, you\u2019re helpless, laughing till the point of tears. Well, he stormed out in a huff, researched it in himself, but you couldn\u2019t stop laughing still.</p><p>H = Hair (How well groomed are they, does the carpet match the drapes, etc.)</p><p>Draco\u2019s carpet is lighter than his drapes, practically a glowing white, he doesn\u2019t like the thought of shaving so asked you to let it grow as well, you will trim to keep things in order. But Draco says it\u2019s more natural and nicer, he also claims it makes you look really hot as well.</p><p>I = Intimacy (How are they during the moment, romantic aspect\u2026)</p><p>Sex is often a stress relief, studying for exams is hard, romance doesn\u2019t often come into it, except on special occasions, birthday, Valentines, and good grades. Only then will he worship every inch of your body, kiss you and lick, leave love bites and tease, only then after you\u2019re begging with he make love to you in ways you didn\u2019t think Draco was comfortable with.</p><p>J = Jack Off (Masturbation headcanon)</p><p>Draco isn\u2019t great, he hasn\u2019t got a technique, the kind of jerks his hips and hopes it will all work out, which means it takes him twenty minutes which he normally gives up on and just ignores the problem.</p><p>K = Kink (One or more of their kinks)</p><p>Praise kink: he loves it, drives him crazy, telling him he is doing great, that he feels amazing stretching you out and that he\u2019s making you so happy, it\u2019s unreal has fast he will move his hips to make you keep saying those words.</p><p>Rope kink: seeing you tied up does something to him, watching how your hands struggle and how your body contours under the control of the rope, he can\u2019t handle himself, he feels ultimately in control.</p><p>L = Location (Favourite places to do the do)</p><p>To Draco Malfoy, every place is a good place to have sex. (eg. Snape\u2019s desk, Dumbledore\u2019s desk, Harry\u2019s bed, Ron\u2019s bed, grand hall, prefect bathrooms etc)</p><p>M = Motivation (What turns them on, gets them going)</p><p>Legs are a massive part of it for Draco, if you wear a skirt to class he is touching them under the desk, feeling the smooth skin and touching higher then he\u2019s meant too. When your confident, it gets him all sorts of aroused, when you stand up to Ron who\u2019s being an arse, he gets the largest erection going, when you beat him at duelling, that really gets him going. You barely make it out the classroom before he\u2019s trying to mount you. Your confidence makes you sexy and Draco likes when you\u2019re empowered.</p><p>N = NO (Something they wouldn\u2019t do, turn-offs)</p><p>Anything to do with death, he\u2019s already seen too much, it\u2019s terrible, he must protect you, it\u2019s vital, he goes through who rituals to protect you, follows you around like a puppy, sits with you at meals, he even tried to convince you to stop eating seafood. Apparently, it\u2019s very dangerous.</p><p>O = Oral (Preference for giving or receiving, skill, etc)</p><p>Draco loves to give you oral, he thinks its weird that someone would want to suck a penis, but him giving you oral is A-okay. He pulled your legs open, licks down your slit tasting you, and easy time you see a gorgeous fire burning in his eyes. He will gently suck on your clit, nibble your inner thigh, he\u2019s a master at it.</p><p>P = Pace (Are they fast and rough? Slow and sensual? etc.)</p><p>Generally, he\u2019s fast and rough, forcing all his stress out in a physical way, but on those few events, then he will make love to you all night long, kissing and gentle touches, Draco likes to be successful at everything he does, so unless you\u2019re fully satisfied he won\u2019t stop, you are priority number one.</p><p>Q = Quickie (Their opinions on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)</p><p>Yes, any way to relieve stress is something he wants to do, he also doesn\u2019t really care were it in, as long as he is inside you, giving you love, the caring he doesn\u2019t mind.</p><p>R = Risk (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)</p><p>With Draco, it isn\u2019t about the risk, it\u2019s about being desperate, he can\u2019t control himself, he will have do you where ever he is, but he is always careful, spells conceal the sound the two of you make just to make sure you\u2019re harder to catch in the act.</p><p>S = Stamina (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last\u2026)</p><p>For the first few times, he only lasted around five minutes before you started helping him, now he can last hours, he has found a good pattern, it offers you two pleasure and really is quite nice. You really don\u2019t mind that he needs it on a nightly basis, you skipped it one night and he was so uptight the next day he nearly killed Harry is potions.</p><p>T = Toy (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)</p><p>Draco was shy when it came to toys, never quite wanted to use them, but when he did, my God he loves them, his favourite is vibrators, he has you begging in minutes and that\u2019s what he wants.</p><p>U = Unfair (how much they like to tease)</p><p>Draco is often described as a bully, you\u2019d call him a bully after sex. During the rough stress relief, he hardly has time to tease you, but when you two are together and relaxing, he is all over you, teasing with licks and kisses and nibbled. There really is no stopping him.</p><p>V = Volume (How loud they are, what sounds they make)</p><p>Draco is more of a grunter then a moaner, he grunts about all sorts, sometimes he whimpers if he is really desperate, he is normally quiet, he\u2019s only noisy when you are really enjoying it. That forces his voice up, and sometimes he has to cast spells to hide the noise the two of you make.</p><p>W = Wild Card (Get a random headcanon for the character of your choice)</p><p>Condom: Draco was quite freaked out, the muggle invention described to catch semen and cum and all that stuff. He didn\u2019t trust them to begin with, got used to them, once he got used to them he loved them.</p><p>X = X-Ray (Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on in those pants, picture or words)</p><p>He has a nice girth, his length pretty average, but he knows what to do with his average, the flesh is so pale and soft, almost mesmerising.</p><p>Y = Yearning (How high is their sex drive?)</p><p>To begin with, Draco was finishing within five minutes and then looking at you confused. Now, however, he is all over you, three hours is his best record and he plans on breaking it in the holidays when he knows there are no distractions he devourers you mercilessly, and you love every minute.</p><p>Z = ZZZ (\u2026 how quickly they fall asleep afterwards)</p><p>Draco is a troubled sleeper, but after sex, he will hold you close, kiss your head as he talks about the happy memories he has and before you realise he\u2019s fast off to sleep, heads pressed together and tangled</p>",

He has a gift for an old colleague who is a resident there.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>As he makes his way upstairs with the gift,the anxious chief care-giver of St Oswald&rsquo;s Home For Old Witches and Wizards whispers, &ldquo;Mr.Weasley,are you sure? Your friend&hellip;He is indeed very ill, and cannot recall or recognize anyone or anything;save for the fact that none of us are&hellip;well,none of us are his son,Sir. At night,he screams for his son in his sleep.The Healer has said that he would have been long dead,but somewhere in his delirious brain still lurks the desire to see his son,and that is what keeps him alive.I am aware of the Minister&rsquo;s orders,but I doubt very much that your efforts will be fruitful,Sir.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Arthur smiles,some of his old genial self peeking through,and simply says,&ldquo;And yet we must try our best,Ma'am&rdquo;,and enters the highest room of the mansion,the ajar door pushed opened to reveal a lavish,but old-fashioned room.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>A king-sized bed with spider-web-thin muslin drapes lay close to one of the walls,by the bay window. An ancient,almost-battered-by-use sofa set stood in the centre,with a griffin-claw footed mahogany table bearing the vestiges of a nearly uneaten breakfast in silver and china utensils,lying upon an Occamy feather rug in front of the stone fireplace crackling merrily with alit pine branches,the air heavy with the aroma. A couple of once-exquisite,now-discoloured tapestries hung above the huge mantlepiece-one depicting Merlin and King Arthur with the Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake,the other depicting Morgane La Faye&rsquo;s tryst with Sir Lancelot,while the corpse of Lady Elaine of Shalot floated down on a boat to Camelot,as Queen Guinevere watched from the shadows. The raw silk curtains and dragon-skin upholstery,along with the lone occupant of the room,completed the poignant look that grandeur leaves when it is silently,progressively replaced by decay.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The frail,senile,seriously sick wizard lies on the bed with his eyes closed,oblivious to the very first visitors in his decades long stay at the old age home. A simple glance at him would be enough to say that the good care-giver was indeed mincing her words when it came to relaying her boarder&rsquo;s true condition to his friend.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The Gift walks over,looks down to the bed,trembles for a moment and then,after what seems like an eternity,calls out to the dozing old man,&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>In an instant,as though by magic,Amos Diggory wakes up,his eyes rather shiny. His fatigued,cataractous vision merely grazes the countenance of his visitor,before his eyes seem to be able to grasp the enormity of the situation.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>&ldquo;Ced?My Boy,is that you?But,they told me,they said&hellip;The Triwizard Tournament&hellip;the third task&hellip; Dumbledore&hellip;Moody&hellip;You-Know-Who&hellip;Fudge said that&hellip;you are&hellip;you are&hellip;oh my son&hellip;Ced,where were you all this time,my precious child?&rdquo; Amos&rsquo; voice chokes as decades worth of tears drop down his cheeks,and he reaches out to touch his son&rsquo;s forever-17 year old handsome face.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The Gift smiles,his eyes welling up,&ldquo;It is okay,Dad. I am here,we are here,it is alright. We will be together now. Everything is fine.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Cedric,or rather this stranger who looks like Amos&rsquo; long dead son Cedric Diggory,proceeds to sit comfortably on one of the armchairs by the fire,and begins to patiently listen to all that the old man has to say,all his little whims,all his party plans for Cedric&rsquo;s graduation from Hogwarts,all the times Amos exclaims,&ldquo;Harry Potter,Ced!You beat him again!Tell that to your children,won&rsquo;t you Ced,won&rsquo;t you,son,won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;,all the times he teases him about someone called &lsquo;Your special lady-friend Cho&rsquo;. Not once does he let the waves of confusion inside him get to the old man,who surprisingly seems to be alive with a different fervour today,as though he has had a boon of immortality bestowed upon him all of a sudden.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>At lunch-time,The Gift opens a lunch-box full of a delicious meal cooked by none other than Molly Weasley herself-a sumptuous chocolate Christmas cake with vanilla and blueberry icing,lamb mince pies,garlic bread with herb encrusted cottage cheese,gin punch,roast turkey,beef Wellington,pot roast,pork chops,tripe,eggnog,treacle tart,fudge,custard creams and Christmas pudding. Amos has his first taste of home-cooked food since his grieving wife&rsquo;s premature death many years ago. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>At sundown,when the care-givers come with Amos&rsquo; daily dose of medication,and to say that it is time for the visitors to leave,causing Amos to enter into a renewed frenzy of anxiety,The Gift tucks Amos in his bed,kisses him on the forehead,and says,&ldquo;Goodnight Dad. I will be back tomorrow. I promise.&rdquo; That promise was all that took to calm the otherwise inconsolable old man,into a resting night&rsquo;s sleep from which,unknown to the Gift,he would never wake up again.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Once he is out of the room,Ted Remus Lupin,one of the very few living Metamorphmagi in England and indeed,the world,turns back from Cedric Diggory to his own true self. He hastily makes his way down the staircase to the waiting room,where Arthur Weasley had been patiently sitting all day on a similar battered armchair by the fire,reading a Muggle newspaper. The two men,green and grey,bid goodbye to the chief care giver,and walk out of the front door,a deafening silence in the shape of Christmas Day creeping up between them.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>As they walked away from the house and towards the main street,Ted is the first one to break the lurking quiet.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>&ldquo;Was it a good thing to do,Grandfather Arthur?Was it the right thing?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Arthur looks into his Grandson-In-Law&rsquo;s confused,and evidently pained face,the considerable experience of his many years raining down as compassion on this orphaned and infinitely kind young man,whose face often reminded him of another unfortunate young and brilliant man,and a jubilant but brave young woman,both of whom Arthur had known a long time ago.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Ted presses on.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what is on the other side,none of us do. What if,what if&hellip;Amos,if one day he meets his Cedric,his true Cedric on the other side&hellip;he would know we played a trick,Grandfather Weasley,he would know&hellip;and he would never forgive us.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Arthur smiles.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>&ldquo;One day,Ted,when you are as old as I am,you will realise how badly Amos wants to leave this world of pains,this life that has been so unkind to him,and for that,he needed a last glance at Cedric. No one knows whether Amos shall ever see Cedric again. No one knows whether I shall see your Uncle Fred again. But the day&hellip;the day we won,the day I lost Fred,I too felt what Amos had felt 3 years previously. Then I knew,Ted and I pray that you never know what that feels like. But know this,yes of course,Amos will forgive us. He will forgive us because he wanted desperately to get out of this cruel world where he was little better than a prisoner,and you helped him face his desire in peace.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Ted Lupin keeps walking in silence. A week ago,he had been summoned to his godfather&rsquo;s home to find that the Minister For Magic was present there too. He wasn&rsquo;t too surprised,for Madam Granger-Weasley was now Aunt Hermione to him by his marriage to Victoire Weasley. Still,he was dazed,as always to see the trio,the heroes of the Second Wizarding War together. His Godfather-now Uncle Harry,Uncle Ron,Aunt Hermione,and Aunt Ginny&hellip;the Pinnacle of Glory brought about by a disaster that had left wizardkind shaken to the core.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Slowly,Hermione explained to him her request.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>A rather silent Harry James Potter handed him a picture taken from a very old news report published years ago in The Daily Prophet-Uncle Harry,Ted&rsquo;s Mother-in-Law Fleur Delacour,Bulgarian Quidditch Player Viktor Krum,and Hogwarts Star Student and Prefect Cedric Diggory-the four champions at the Wand Weighing Ceremony before the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament,the tournament which would end with Cedric Diggory&rsquo;s murder by Voldemort. There was another report with another picture,stating the 'unfortunate accidental death of Cedric Diggory during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament.&rsquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Uncle Ron and Aunt Ginny had only watched in silence,ashen faced.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>&ldquo;We shall not force you if you don&rsquo;t want to,Ted. But you are the best man for the job,and maybe we could give Amos Diggory a last chance to be happy for once&rdquo;,Hermione had said,ever so gently.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Uncle Harry had seemed uninterested in facing the rest of the occupants of the room,keeping his face to the fire,his face a shroud.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Ted Lupin did not want to,initially. He considered it an act of great treachery to take the advantage of a helpless senile man-was this what his only gift from his long-dead mother Nymphadora Tonks,would be reduced to?A ploy for deceit?</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>He had finally changed his mind after a lot of pleading from the entire family,but his disappointment had often kept surging to the surface throughout the days. It was over,they had it all,all the glory,the exalted greatness,the fame of being some sort of alternate royalty amongst British Wizards,the tag of 'First Family&rsquo; of Magic Britain as popularised by tabloids-they had it all,why now pretend as though all that had come at no cost? The prices paid were very real. Ted was living proof of that. The Weasley Family clock with only 8 moving hands,Fred&rsquo;s being fixed at 'dead&rsquo;-that was another daily reminder and concrete proof. Another proof was an absent-minded Grandmother Molly often getting startled at a sudden sight of Uncle George and exclaiming &ldquo;Oh Fr&hellip;I mean George,come and sit down for dinner,dear.&rdquo; The sudden pallor on Uncle George&rsquo;s face when he heard that was proof enough. There were other innumerable proofs,hidden in every corner,in every household,in each family of the country. Why then show them this profound disregard?</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>However,very late that night,as he awakes from a deep sleep with a start,initiated by a shapeless,soundless maze that are his dreams,Ted realises that he is glad,having agreed to do his last bit for Amos Diggory.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>For the first time,Ted Lupin is really glad that he went to see Amos as Cedric,because it had made him stop pondering. In doing it,He had found closure to a question that kept prodding at the back of his all these years,a question that,inspite of the presence of so many paternal figures in his life,was never really answered.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>For the first time in nearly three decades of his walking the Earth,Edward Remus Lupin now knows what it would be like,to meet his own father,Remus John Lupin,werewolf and martyr of the Battle of Hogwarts,and that gives him contentment enough. He wants little else now. Looking out the window,he notices that the crisp snowfall of the morning has once again turned into the usual blizzard and rainfall of the past few days,but the storm in his own soul has been calmed once and for all.</p>",

Amos has his first taste of home-cooked food since his grieving wife\u2019s premature death many years ago. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>At sundown,when the care-givers come with Amos\u2019 daily dose of medication,and to say that it is time for the visitors to leave,causing Amos to enter into a renewed frenzy of anxiety,The Gift tucks Amos in his bed,kisses him on the forehead,and says,\u201cGoodnight Dad. I will be back tomorrow. I promise.\u201d That promise was all that took to calm the otherwise inconsolable old man,into a resting night\u2019s sleep from which,unknown to the Gift,he would never wake up again.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Once he is out of the room,Ted Remus Lupin,one of the very few living Metamorphmagi in England and indeed,the world,turns back from Cedric Diggory to his own true self. He hastily makes his way down the staircase to the waiting room,where Arthur Weasley had been patiently sitting all day on a similar battered armchair by the fire,reading a Muggle newspaper. The two men,green and grey,bid goodbye to the chief care giver,and walk out of the front door,a deafening silence in the shape of Christmas Day creeping up between them.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>As they walked away from the house and towards the main street,Ted is the first one to break the lurking quiet.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cWas it a good thing to do,Grandfather Arthur?Was it the right thing?\u201d</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Arthur looks into his Grandson-In-Law\u2019s confused,and evidently pained face,the considerable experience of his many years raining down as compassion on this orphaned and infinitely kind young man,whose face often reminded him of another unfortunate young and brilliant man,and a jubilant but brave young woman,both of whom Arthur had known a long time ago.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Ted presses on.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is on the other side,none of us do. What if,what if\u2026Amos,if one day he meets his Cedric,his true Cedric on the other side\u2026he would know we played a trick,Grandfather Weasley,he would know\u2026and he would never forgive us.\u201d</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Arthur smiles.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cOne day,Ted,when you are as old as I am,you will realise how badly Amos wants to leave this world of pains,this life that has been so unkind to him,and for that,he needed a last glance at Cedric. No one knows whether Amos shall ever see Cedric again. No one knows whether I shall see your Uncle Fred again. But the day\u2026the day we won,the day I lost Fred,I too felt what Amos had felt 3 years previously. Then I knew,Ted and I pray that you never know what that feels like. But know this,yes of course,Amos will forgive us. He will forgive us because he wanted desperately to get out of this cruel world where he was little better than a prisoner,and you helped him face his desire in peace.\u201d</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Ted Lupin keeps walking in silence. A week ago,he had been summoned to his godfather\u2019s home to find that the Minister For Magic was present there too. He wasn\u2019t too surprised,for Madam Granger-Weasley was now Aunt Hermione to him by his marriage to Victoire Weasley. Still,he was dazed,as always to see the trio,the heroes of the Second Wizarding War together. His Godfather-now Uncle Harry,Uncle Ron,Aunt Hermione,and Aunt Ginny\u2026the Pinnacle of Glory brought about by a disaster that had left wizardkind shaken to the core.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Slowly,Hermione explained to him her request.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>A rather silent Harry James Potter handed him a picture taken from a very old news report published years ago in The Daily Prophet-Uncle Harry,Ted\u2019s Mother-in-Law Fleur Delacour,Bulgarian Quidditch Player Viktor Krum,and Hogwarts Star Student and Prefect Cedric Diggory-the four champions at the Wand Weighing Ceremony before the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament,the tournament which would end with Cedric Diggory\u2019s murder by Voldemort. There was another report with another picture,stating the 'unfortunate accidental death of Cedric Diggory during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament.\u2019</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Uncle Ron and Aunt Ginny had only watched in silence,ashen faced.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u201cWe shall not force you if you don\u2019t want to,Ted. But you are the best man for the job,and maybe we could give Amos Diggory a last chance to be happy for once\u201d,Hermione had said,ever so gently.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Uncle Harry had seemed uninterested in facing the rest of the occupants of the room,keeping his face to the fire,his face a shroud.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>Ted Lupin did not want to,initially. He considered it an act of great treachery to take the advantage of a helpless senile man-was this what his only gift from his long-dead mother Nymphadora Tonks,would be reduced to?A ploy for deceit?</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>He had finally changed his mind after a lot of pleading from the entire family,but his disappointment had often kept surging to the surface throughout the days. It was over,they had it all,all the glory,the exalted greatness,the fame of being some sort of alternate royalty amongst British Wizards,the tag of 'First Family\u2019 of Magic Britain as popularised by tabloids-they had it all,why now pretend as though all that had come at no cost? The prices paid were very real. Ted was living proof of that. The Weasley Family clock with only 8 moving hands,Fred\u2019s being fixed at 'dead\u2019-that was another daily reminder and concrete proof. Another proof was an absent-minded Grandmother Molly often getting startled at a sudden sight of Uncle George and exclaiming \u201cOh Fr\u2026I mean George,come and sit down for dinner,dear.\u201d The sudden pallor on Uncle George\u2019s face when he heard that was proof enough. There were other innumerable proofs,hidden in every corner,in every household,in each family of the country. Why then show them this profound disregard?</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>However,very late that night,as he awakes from a deep sleep with a start,initiated by a shapeless,soundless maze that are his dreams,Ted realises that he is glad,having agreed to do his last bit for Amos Diggory.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>For the first time,Ted Lupin is really glad that he went to see Amos as Cedric,because it had made him stop pondering. In doing it,He had found closure to a question that kept prodding at the back of his all these years,a question that,inspite of the presence of so many paternal figures in his life,was never really answered.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>For the first time in nearly three decades of his walking the Earth,Edward Remus Lupin now knows what it would be like,to meet his own father,Remus John Lupin,werewolf and martyr of the Battle of Hogwarts,and that gives him contentment enough. He wants little else now. Looking out the window,he notices that the crisp snowfall of the morning has once again turned into the usual blizzard and rainfall of the past few days,but the storm in his own soul has been calmed once and for all.</p></p>",

An ancient,almost-battered-by-use sofa set stood in the centre,with a griffin-claw footed mahogany table bearing the vestiges of a nearly uneaten breakfast in silver and china utensils,lying upon an Occamy feather rug in front of the stone fireplace crackling merrily with alit pine branches,the air heavy with the aroma. A couple of once-exquisite,now-discoloured tapestries hung above the huge mantlepiece-one depicting Merlin and King Arthur with the Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake,the other depicting Morgane La Faye\u2019s tryst with Sir Lancelot,while the corpse of Lady Elaine of Shalot floated down on a boat to Camelot,as Queen Guinevere watched from the shadows. The raw silk curtains and dragon-skin upholstery,along with the lone occupant of the room,completed the poignant look that grandeur leaves when it is silently,progressively replaced by decay.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>The frail,senile,seriously sick wizard lies on the bed with his eyes closed,oblivious to the very first visitors in his decades long stay at the old age home.

An ancient,almost-battered-by-use sofa set stood in the centre,with a griffin-claw footed mahogany table bearing the vestiges of a nearly uneaten breakfast in silver and china utensils,lying upon an Occamy feather rug in front of the stone fireplace crackling merrily with alit pine branches,the air heavy with the aroma. A couple of once-exquisite,now-discoloured tapestries hung above the huge mantlepiece-one depicting Merlin and King Arthur with the Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake,the other depicting Morgane La Faye&rsquo;s tryst with Sir Lancelot,while the corpse of Lady Elaine of Shalot floated down on a boat to Camelot,as Queen Guinevere watched from the shadows. The raw silk curtains and dragon-skin upholstery,along with the lone occupant of the room,completed the poignant look that grandeur leaves when it is silently,progressively replaced by decay.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">The frail,senile,seriously sick wizard lies on the bed with his eyes closed,oblivious to the very first visitors in his decades long stay at the old age home. A simple glance at him would be enough to say that the good care-giver was indeed mincing her words when it came to relaying her boarder&rsquo;s true condition to his friend.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">The Gift walks over,looks down to the bed,trembles for a moment and then,after what seems like an eternity,calls out to the dozing old man,&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">In an instant,as though by magic,Amos Diggory wakes up,his eyes rather shiny. His fatigued,cataractous vision merely grazes the countenance of his visitor,before his eyes seem to be able to grasp the enormity of the situation.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;Ced?My Boy,is that you?But,they told me,they said&hellip;The Triwizard Tournament&hellip;the third task&hellip; Dumbledore&hellip;Moody&hellip;You-Know-Who&hellip;Fudge said that&hellip;you are&hellip;you are&hellip;oh my son&hellip;Ced,where were you all this time,my precious child?&rdquo; Amos&rsquo; voice chokes as decades worth of tears drop down his cheeks,and he reaches out to touch his son&rsquo;s forever-17 year old handsome face.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">The Gift smiles,his eyes welling up,&ldquo;It is okay,Dad. I am here,we are here,it is alright. We will be together now. Everything is fine.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Cedric,or rather this stranger who looks like Amos&rsquo; long dead son Cedric Diggory,proceeds to sit comfortably on one of the armchairs by the fire,and begins to patiently listen to all that the old man has to say,all his little whims,all his party plans for Cedric&rsquo;s graduation from Hogwarts,all the times Amos exclaims,&ldquo;Harry Potter,Ced!You beat him again!Tell that to your children,won&rsquo;t you Ced,won&rsquo;t you,son,won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;,all the times he teases him about someone called &lsquo;Your special lady-friend Cho&rsquo;. Not once does he let the waves of confusion inside him get to the old man,who surprisingly seems to be alive with a different fervour today,as though he has had a boon of immortality bestowed upon him all of a sudden.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">At lunch-time,The Gift opens a lunch-box full of a delicious meal cooked by none other than Molly Weasley herself-a sumptuous chocolate Christmas cake with vanilla and blueberry icing,lamb mince pies,garlic bread with herb encrusted cottage cheese,gin punch,roast turkey,beef Wellington,pot roast,pork chops,tripe,eggnog,treacle tart,fudge,custard creams and Christmas pudding. Amos has his first taste of home-cooked food since his grieving wife&rsquo;s premature death many years ago. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">At sundown,when the care-givers come with Amos&rsquo; daily dose of medication,and to say that it is time for the visitors to leave,causing Amos to enter into a renewed frenzy of anxiety,The Gift tucks Amos in his bed,kisses him on the forehead,and says,&ldquo;Goodnight Dad. I will be back tomorrow. I promise.&rdquo; That promise was all that took to calm the otherwise inconsolable old man,into a resting night&rsquo;s sleep from which,unknown to the Gift,he would never wake up again.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Once he is out of the room,Ted Remus Lupin,one of the very few living Metamorphmagi in England and indeed,the world,turns back from Cedric Diggory to his own true self. He hastily makes his way down the staircase to the waiting room,where Arthur Weasley had been patiently sitting all day on a similar battered armchair by the fire,reading a Muggle newspaper. The two men,green and grey,bid goodbye to the chief care giver,and walk out of the front door,a deafening silence in the shape of Christmas Day creeping up between them.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">As they walked away from the house and towards the main street,Ted is the first one to break the lurking quiet.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;Was it a good thing to do,Grandfather Arthur?Was it the right thing?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Arthur looks into his Grandson-In-Law&rsquo;s confused,and evidently pained face,the considerable experience of his many years raining down as compassion on this orphaned and infinitely kind young man,whose face often reminded him of another unfortunate young and brilliant man,and a jubilant but brave young woman,both of whom Arthur had known a long time ago.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Ted presses on.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what is on the other side,none of us do. What if,what if&hellip;Amos,if one day he meets his Cedric,his true Cedric on the other side&hellip;he would know we played a trick,Grandfather Weasley,he would know&hellip;and he would never forgive us.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Arthur smiles.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;One day,Ted,when you are as old as I am,you will realise how badly Amos wants to leave this world of pains,this life that has been so unkind to him,and for that,he needed a last glance at Cedric. No one knows whether Amos shall ever see Cedric again. No one knows whether I shall see your Uncle Fred again. But the day&hellip;the day we won,the day I lost Fred,I too felt what Amos had felt 3 years previously. Then I knew,Ted and I pray that you never know what that feels like. But know this,yes of course,Amos will forgive us. He will forgive us because he wanted desperately to get out of this cruel world where he was little better than a prisoner,and you helped him face his desire in peace.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Ted Lupin keeps walking in silence. A week ago,he had been summoned to his godfather&rsquo;s home to find that the Minister For Magic was present there too. He wasn&rsquo;t too surprised,for Madam Granger-Weasley was now Aunt Hermione to him by his marriage to Victoire Weasley. Still,he was dazed,as always to see the trio,the heroes of the Second Wizarding War together. His Godfather-now Uncle Harry,Uncle Ron,Aunt Hermione,and Aunt Ginny&hellip;the Pinnacle of Glory brought about by a disaster that had left wizardkind shaken to the core.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Slowly,Hermione explained to him her request.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">A rather silent Harry James Potter handed him a picture taken from a very old news report published years ago in The Daily Prophet-Uncle Harry,Ted&rsquo;s Mother-in-Law Fleur Delacour,Bulgarian Quidditch Player Viktor Krum,and Hogwarts Star Student and Prefect Cedric Diggory-the four champions at the Wand Weighing Ceremony before the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament,the tournament which would end with Cedric Diggory&rsquo;s murder by Voldemort. There was another report with another picture,stating the 'unfortunate accidental death of Cedric Diggory during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament.&rsquo;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Uncle Ron and Aunt Ginny had only watched in silence,ashen faced.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&ldquo;We shall not force you if you don&rsquo;t want to,Ted. But you are the best man for the job,and maybe we could give Amos Diggory a last chance to be happy for once&rdquo;,Hermione had said,ever so gently.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Uncle Harry had seemed uninterested in facing the rest of the occupants of the room,keeping his face to the fire,his face a shroud.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Ted Lupin did not want to,initially. He considered it an act of great treachery to take the advantage of a helpless senile man-was this what his only gift from his long-dead mother Nymphadora Tonks,would be reduced to?A ploy for deceit?</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">He had finally changed his mind after a lot of pleading from the entire family,but his disappointment had often kept surging to the surface throughout the days. It was over,they had it all,all the glory,the exalted greatness,the fame of being some sort of alternate royalty amongst British Wizards,the tag of 'First Family&rsquo; of Magic Britain as popularised by tabloids-they had it all,why now pretend as though all that had come at no cost? The prices paid were very real. Ted was living proof of that. The Weasley Family clock with only 8 moving hands,Fred&rsquo;s being fixed at 'dead&rsquo;-that was another daily reminder and concrete proof. Another proof was an absent-minded Grandmother Molly often getting startled at a sudden sight of Uncle George and exclaiming &ldquo;Oh Fr&hellip;I mean George,come and sit down for dinner,dear.&rdquo; The sudden pallor on Uncle George&rsquo;s face when he heard that was proof enough. There were other innumerable proofs,hidden in every corner,in every household,in each family of the country. Why then show them this profound disregard?</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">However,very late that night,as he awakes from a deep sleep with a start,initiated by a shapeless,soundless maze that are his dreams,Ted realises that he is glad,having agreed to do his last bit for Amos Diggory.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">For the first time,Ted Lupin is really glad that he went to see Amos as Cedric,because it had made him stop pondering. In doing it,He had found closure to a question that kept prodding at the back of his all these years,a question that,inspite of the presence of so many paternal figures in his life,was never really answered.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">For the first time in nearly three decades of his walking the Earth,Edward Remus Lupin now knows what it would be like,to meet his own father,Remus John Lupin,werewolf and martyr of the Battle of Hogwarts,and that gives him contentment enough. He wants little else now. Looking out the window,he notices that the crisp snowfall of the morning has once again turned into the usual blizzard and rainfall of the past few days,but the storm in his own soul has been calmed once and for all.</p></p>",
