The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most. </i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a></p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p>After Dan and Mona have served breakfast to the two - yes, just two - couples staying at the hotel, they clear everything away, leaving the tablecloths out for the lunch service in a few hours. As they are pretty much cut off from civilisation up here, guests are served three meals a day, along with optional extra nibbles sent to their rooms upon request. It takes Dan a full day of quietly observing, but he eventually comes to understand that The Secret of the Alps is not a place people come for adventure, or entertainment.<br/></p><p>The hotel is instead a serene, atmospheric getaway, isolated high up in the scenic Swiss Alps, away from the stresses of civilisation. People come here not for planned activities, but to spend time alone, or with each other, reading books by the fire, playing scrabble, or taking the occasional guided walk around the safe paths of the mountain. These walks are led by Kaspar, who can be called up a day in advance. There\u2019s a jacuzzi and sauna outside at the back of the hotel for guests to enjoy, a small gym, and a lounge stocked with a wide range of books and board games as Dan has seen. Louise is available for cooking classes if guests are interested, and each night Mona puts on a film for the guests in the mezzanine area; Louise makes buttery popcorn and Bailey\u2019s hot chocolate for everyone, and if people are feeling social, sometimes they loiter there well into the night, chatting. </p><!-- more --><p>It\u2019s probably not what Dan would choose for a holiday, but he understands the appeal. If you were some corporate lawyer-type drowning in fast-paced city life, it would be tempting to come somewhere remote and distant, where the WiFi is shocking enough that nobody can really contact you. </p><p>\u201cSo, for this week, I\u2019m just going to have you follow me around, like you have been today,\u201d Mona explains to Dan in a hushed voice. His shift is almost over, and the evening film is just starting for the guests. She and Dan are at the back of the mezzanine lounge, stood next to the serving hatch, through which Louise is leaning, chin in her hand as she watches the opening credits roll. \u201cThat way you\u2019ll get used to the routine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0</p><p>He met Louise earlier, as he brought through the dirty plates after dinner, and though their exchange was only brief, he feels that she\u2019s the type of dry, sarcastic person he could eventually be friends with.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou say that, but Mona\u2019s a tyrant,\u201d Louise mutters, and Mona shoots her a stern look. \u201cIf you need a break from the whip-cracking, come find me. I\u2019ll keep you caffeinated, it\u2019ll make the week go faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Anyway,</i>\u201d Mona says pointedly, \u201cthings don\u2019t differ much day-to-day here, as you\u2019ll come to learn.\u201d Louise makes a grunting sound of assent. \u201cBy the end of the week, I reckon you\u2019ll have the routine down, and then we can start giving you some more independence. Manning reception on your own, that kind of thing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says, stifling a yawn. \u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think Dan might be about to fall asleep on his feet,\u201d Louise says amusedly, making Dan straighten up. </p><p>\u201cN-no, I\u2019m awake,\u201d he says hurriedly. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just not used to the long days yet, and it\u2019s dark in here-\u201d</p><p>Mona laughs, then pats him on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Dan. This job can be boring and somehow exhausting at once. You can call it a night, I\u2019ll see you bright and early.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiles at her gratefully, then yelps as Louise reaches out and pinches his arm. Two of the guests watching the movie turn around at the high-pitched squeal, making Louise giggle. </p><p>\u201cNight, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d he says, and then scurries towards the stairs. </p><p>By the time he gets to the top floor his knees are about to give way; he pauses in the hallway, digging in his pocket for his room key, more than ready for this day to be over. It hasn\u2019t been <i>awful</i>, just long and strenuous. As he pulls out the key, he notices a sliver of yellow light beneath the door of room eight, the one beside his. For a long moment, Dan stares at this light, his overtired brain struggling to work out what it could mean. Mona mentioned that she sleeps on the ground floor, in a room attached to the office. Louise and all of the other guests are still downstairs watching the film, so it can\u2019t be any of them, unless one of them inexplicably left their light on. </p><p>Too tired to consider this further, Dan lets himself into his own room, deciding he\u2019ll just ask Mona about it tomorrow. Once again, he barely makes it to the bed - though this time he does manage to pull on pyjamas - before curling up in the thick covers and letting the tears fall. </p><p>He\u2019s well into becoming a gross mess - nose running heavily, eyes piggy and sore - when he hears something odd enough to make him pause. A waft of soft, calming notes, shaping a sweet melody, filtering into his room through the wall behind his bed. He sits up against the pillows, ears straining, his face damp. He\u2019s so puzzled by the music that he forgets why he\u2019s crying, and just listens. In the stillness of the night, the music is the sole sound, worming its way beneath Dan\u2019s skin, and settling into his weary bones. </p><p>He has just enough wakefulness left in his brain to wonder how classical music could be playing at a range close enough for him to hear right now, considering everyone else is supposedly downstairs watching <i>Ocean\u2019s Eleven</i>. Before he can think of any answer, however, he is slipping down into the mattress, and then right through it, until he\u2019s floating into a sea of dream. </p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock in the evening, and Dan\u2019s second day is winding down. He is at the front desk, which he&rsquo;s beginning to recognise as his base camp for the times of day when he\u2019s without pressing tasks - which is often. Mona\u2019s base camp is the office behind the reception desk, where she does scary managerial business like handling the accounts and speaking to investors.\u00a0</p><p>At the moment Mona is upstairs in the kitchen, asking Louise to make she and Dan something to eat, as the dinner rush is over now. Just as Dan is about to give in and dig in his pocket for his phone to alleviate the boredom, he hears the back door that leads to the jacuzzi and sauna opening. The door is around the corner from the reception desk, hidden from Dan\u2019s view, but he straightens in his seat nonetheless, preparing to make polite small talk with one of the guests. </p><p>To his total astonishment, a man walks into the lobby that he has never seen before. He\u2019s wearing one of the robes left for guests in each room, as well as the complimentary slippers. The robe is loosely tied around his waist, as if it might undo itself any moment, and reveal the long, toned, naked body beneath. His black hair is wet, dripping to his shoulders. As he passes the desk, he aims a vague smile at what he clearly assumes will be Mona, as when he sees Dan sat there, he does a double take. </p><p>Fixed in place by two inhumanly blue eyes, Dan cannot find a single word to utter. This man is an apparition, serene and impossible. How is he here? Dan has met all of the guests and staff. Mona would surely have told him if there were anyone else by this point. They are up the side of a mountain, with no means of being reached save for a private plane or a death-defying cable car ride, so he can\u2019t be an intruder, yet Dan cannot think of another explanation. He thinks of shouting for Mona, but still he cannot summon his voice. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the man says, half-mumbled. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t stop walking, so Dan has no chance to respond even if he could, and then the man is climbing the stairs to the mezzanine, and disappearing out of sight. Ten minutes later, when Mona reappears, Dan explains to her what just happened in a rush, the words spilling out as if whatever had stoppered them up before has been violently uncorked at her reappearance. </p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Mona says, clearing her throat. She hands him a bowl of what looks like chilli, with a slice of crusty bread. \u201cThat\u2019s Mr Novokoric,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s our\u2026 special guest. Don\u2019t concern yourself with him right now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guest?\u201d </p><p>Mona hesitates. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t come for breakfast,\u201d Dan points out, bewildered. \u201cOr lunch, or dinner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Novokoric has his meals in his room,\u201d Mona says briskly, fidgeting with obvious discomfort. \u201cWhen he eats at all, that is,\u201d she mutters, lower. \u201cI will explain about all that later, Dan,\u201d she promises. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s just focus on the main aspects of the job, getting your routine in place&hellip;\u201d </p><p>She rambles on about the responsibilities he\u2019s still getting to terms with, and he half-listens, unable to stop the hundreds of questions about this mysterious \u2018other\u2019 guest from swooshing around in his mind. With a lot of effort, and mostly because he feels his and Mona\u2019s professional relationship is still in its infancy, he swallows his curiosity down with a spoonful of piping hot chilli. </p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Dan\u2019s third working at The Secret of the Alps, he is up even earlier than usual. He\u2019d gotten more sleep than his previous two nights, thanks to the music that again drifted through the wall to staunch his free-flowing tears.\u00a0</p><p>The light filtering through the window is still too startling to ignore however, so he abandons any attempt at staying in bed, and dresses quickly, hoping to impress Mona with his work ethic by getting an extra early start. Sure enough, he\u2019s the first one to reach the front desk, though he can hear Mona in her room at the back of the office shuffling around - perhaps gluing her unmoving bun in position with industrial strength adhesive. Whatever she\u2019s up to, Dan knows he doesn\u2019t have long before she emerges, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, so he sets himself up at the desk and attempts to look productive. As he skims through the hotel brochure, scanning photos of happy families in bobble-hats, and wine-flushed couples in front of log fires, his mind wanders back down the mountain, to his old life - his real life - which lurks menacingly below him, claws outstretched, ready to snatch him back the moment he peeks over the precipice. </p><p>He hears vague footsteps on the stairs, and assumes it must be Louise, as she\u2019s the only other person he could conceive might be up this early. He and Louise have struck up an instant colloquial rapport which he\u2019s grateful for, even in the few days he\u2019s been here, so Dan says, without looking up, \u201cunngh, need caffeine, Lou. I\u2019ll tip my head back and you just pour the coffee down my throat, kay?\u201d </p><p>He expects, of course, one of Louise\u2019s snarky yet fond comebacks, probably focused on how inadvertently sexual that request sounded. He waits for the cut of her steel tongue, but it doesn\u2019t come. \u00a0Dan looks up, and meets the two vibrant blue eyes he remembers from yesterday evening, over which two dark eyebrows are arched high on a pale, exposed forehead. At once, Dan flushes, shutting the brochure with a slap, and sitting up straighter in his chair. </p><p>\u201cOh, God, sorry, I thought you were someone else. Um, good morning-\u201d Dan struggles to recall the name Mona had given this man last night - Novak? Novorak? He\u2019s not sure. \u201c&hellip;Sir.\u201d Best to be on the safe side. \u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d </p><p>The blue-eyed man doesn\u2019t pause, crossing the lobby towards the door, but he does shake his head slightly in response to Dan\u2019s question. He\u2019s a startling thing to behold so early in the morning. His shock of onyx hair contrasts against the scarlet snow-jacket he\u2019s wearing. It takes Dan a moment for his eyes to adjust to the sheer vibrancy of him, and an even longer moment to realise that tucked beneath his arm are two cherry-red skis. </p><p><i>Skiing and snowboarding is not a good idea up here</i>, Mona\u2019s voice echoes in his head. <i>The mountain is treacherous and unpredictable, so stress that to guests&hellip;</i></p><p>Dan jumps to his feet at once, heart already in his throat as he watches the man nearing the front door, apparently about to walk outside and strap those skis to his feet, then most likely hurl himself to his untimely death. </p><p>\u201cOh, S-Sir, hold on,\u201d Dan calls out, jogging out from the desk and over towards the man, who has turned to him with such an expression of astonishment that it\u2019s as if Dan had begun to perform a striptease right in the middle of the lobby. \u201cS-sorry,\u201d Dan says, stepping towards him more cautiously now, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not allowed to ski here.\u201d </p><p>One of those dark eyebrows arches upwards again. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not permitted for guests to ski,\u201d Dan says hurriedly; he can feel a steady blossoming of burst capillaries in either cheek. \u201cThe mountain is, um,\u201d what did Mona say? \u201c&hellip;treacherous. You could be hurt.\u201d</p><p>A long moment passes, during which time Dan begins to wonder if maybe he should repeat himself, slower, as perhaps this man doesn\u2019t understand English very well. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d the man asks eventually, in the sort of voice Dan recognises from all the times he\u2019s dealt with petulant, \u2018I-want-to-speak-to-the-manager\u2019 type middle-aged women in the retail jobs he\u2019s worked. </p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he replies, swallowing. </p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re the new concierge, Dan?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 yes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The man hitches his skis up into the crook of his arm. \u201cI suggest that next time you decide you have any right to come up and reprimand me, that you consult with your boss before making a fool of yourself.\u201d </p><p>He says this in such a calm monotone that it takes Dan a few seconds to realise how rudely he\u2019s just been spoken to. He blushes again, absurdly. \u201cI-I\u2019m really very sorry, Sir, but I can\u2019t allow you to leave the hotel with those skis.\u201d</p><p>The man fixes him with a glare that would put the Real Housewives to shame. \u201cAnd what is it that you\u2019re going to do to stop me, Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ll, um-\u201d </p><p>Dan is saved from finishing this sentence by the sound of Mona\u2019s kitten heels tapping hurriedly across the wooden floor. As she gets closer, Dan can hear that she is muttering \u201coh, dear god\u201d repeatedly under her breath. Relieved that he is no longer on his own in this situation, Dan takes a subtle step backwards from the hostile guest. He averts his gaze from those hard, cold blue eyes as he waits for Mona to assert her prim, managerial dominance over this man, and confiscate his forbidden sports equipment. </p><p>\u201cI am <i>so</i> sorry Mr Novokoric,\u201d she blurts, much to Dan\u2019s horror. \u201cPlease forgive Dan, he only arrived yesterday and isn\u2019t yet aware of your special circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Mr Novokoric huffs an impatient sigh, but nods tightly. \u201cMight I recommend offering treats to help him learn faster.\u201d </p><p>\u201cVery funny, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Mona says with a polite, false-sounding laugh. Dan\u2019s cheeks are now rivalling the man\u2019s jacket, he\u2019s certain. Surely he can\u2019t have just implied Dan were a <i>dog</i>, and Mona is simply <i>laughing</i>. To Dan\u2019s abject bafflement, she then seems to actually give a small bow of her head. Where is his stern, no-nonsense, manageress in shining armour? This is not the same woman he recognises from the last two days. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Dan up to speed in no time. This won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric nods again, sliding a final, disapproving look towards Dan for good measure before muttering something like \u2018alright then\u2019, and slipping out of the door. As soon as Dan is relatively sure the man is out of earshot, he turns to Mona, scandalised. </p><p>\u201cPlease explain to me what just happened,\u201d he says, as calmly as he can manage given that he is utterly seething. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mona says, then considers this. \u201cWell, yes, but you weren\u2019t to know. It\u2019s my fault, I was trying to ease you in, but I should have discussed Mr Novokoric\u2019s special case sooner. I apologise for that. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d have the chance to speak to him without me being there.\u201d </p><p>Dan waits for her to continue, but she simply turns away, strolling determinedly back towards the desk, and nimbly side-stepping the entire issue. \u201cWell, I would appreciate being filled in now,\u201d Dan says, hot on her heels. \u201cI don\u2019t fancy being on the receiving end of one of Mr Nobby-whatsit\u2019s glacial stares again any time soon.\u201d </p><p>Mona sighs, smoothing down the non-existent stray hairs from her high bun. \u201cAll right,\u201d she says after a moment of deliberation. She gestures for him to follow her, and moves towards the stairs up to the mezzanine. \u201cCome up and have some breakfast. We can discuss it - briefly - as we eat.\u201d </p><p>For some reason, Dan\u2019s heart is fluttering in his chest. He tries to imagine what possible secrets are about to be revealed to him surrounding this mysterious, moody ski-enthusiast. Perhaps Mr Novo-whatever is some sort of secret agent, using his skis to swoop from mission to mission. Or perhaps he\u2019s a mentally-unstable ex-patient of some nearby facility that could no longer afford to keep him due to his hostile nature. </p><p>He\u2019s so caught up in these various possibilities that he doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s followed Mona into the kitchen until Louise is pushing a bowl of porridge into his hands. The letter \u2018D\u2019 is drizzled on top in syrup, and there are blueberries scattered across the surface. </p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d he says, chuffed. He aims a grateful smile at Louise. \u201cD for Dan?\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head to one side, frowning. \u201cHuh. Didn\u2019t think of that. I was going for Dick-brain.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, but digs straight in; it\u2019s thick, warm and sweet. \u201cOrgasmic as usual, Lou. Got any coffee to go with it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s blueberry, honey and cinnamon,\u201d Louise tells him enthusiastically, her front two gap-teeth bared. She\u2019s already at the coffee machine, turning vials and spurting steam without needing to look at what she\u2019s doing. \u201cIs it the best porridge you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d</p><p>He considers this for a moment, then bites down on a blueberry, which bursts out a tangy, tart flavour that mixes so deliciously with the sweet syrup, that Dan actually moans. \u201cOh, hands down.\u201d </p><p>Pleased with this response, Louise makes his coffee double strength, which Dan notices, and hopes Mona doesn\u2019t. \u201cI like this one, Mo,\u201d Louise calls over the hissing of steam as she makes Mona a cappuccino. \u201cDon\u2019t go scaring him off like you did the last one.\u201d </p><p>Dan wonders if the failure and possible trauma of his predecessor should alarm him, but finds that he\u2019s too busy enjoying the blissful experience of Louise\u2019s porridge to really care. Besides, he\u2019s already here now, has already given up his life back in England to do this; it\u2019s going to have to be something really stupendously terrifying to chase him back to the ruins of what he left behind. </p><p>\u201cI did not scare that little nitwit off,\u201d Mona says sniffily. \u201cShe was far too sensitive. I only told her she couldn\u2019t fold a towel to save her life. Which is not true of Dan, so it\u2019s all fine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Louise says, pouring foam. She walks over and hands the cappuccino to Mona, giving her a look. \u201cJust don\u2019t hurl him into the deep end without a life raft.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I <i>was</i> trying to ease him in,\u201d Mona says with a heavy sigh. She blows on the coffee, then plucks a teaspoon from nearby and scoops some froth into her mouth. \u201cBut I took my eye off him for two seconds and he went squaring up to the beast.\u201d </p><p>Louise makes a face halfway between a grimace and a grin, turning to Dan. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve met His Lordship, then?\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts into his near-empty bowl. \u201cIs that what you call him? He does act as if he\u2019s Royalty.\u201d Mona and Louise exchange a look so loaded with unspoken <i>somethings</i> that Dan actually pauses, spoon of porridge halfway to his mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Louise chuckles, seemingly to herself, and turns to uncover what looks like a delicious homemade loaf of bread, which she immediately begins sawing into thick slices for the guest breakfast. Dan turns to Mona, sensing that Louise is not going to be the forthcoming one here. Mona\u2019s fidgeting, which seems unusual for her, not that Dan is the best judge given that he\u2019s only known her forty-eight hours. </p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d she says eventually, seeming to navigate some internal minefield of appropriate phrasing. \u201cI know we\u2019ve only just met, but there\u2019s something I need to ask of you.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods slowly, aware that Louise is watching him, though she\u2019s trying very hard to pretend she\u2019s focused solely on the bread. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says warily. </p><p>\u201cI understand it\u2019s a bit early to ask you to commit, but\u2026 do you think you\u2019d be interested in permanently accepting this job?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 yes,\u201d Dan says. Briefly, he thinks of his final discussion with his father, the gist of which had been <i>\u2018if you do something as stupid and reckless as pissing off to waste your time up the top of a snowy hill, I\u2019ll disown you\u2019</i>. Even that lovely parting sentiment hadn\u2019t managed to dissuade Dan from coming here though, so he supposes he must really be serious about his decision to do this. \u201cI\u2019m not going to back out, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d </p><p>Mona casts a brief, relieved look in Louise\u2019s direction, which is happily returned. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s very good to hear, Dan. Okay then,\u201d she says, placing her cup of coffee down carefully in order to clasp her hands together at her waist. \u201cWhat I need to ask you, in that case, is for your total discretion. I need your word, unwaveringly, to keep quiet about a certain matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about Mr Novocaine?\u201d </p><p>Louise\u2019s bark of laughter is shrill and high. \u201cAt last! I have someone on my level of comedic talent to witticise with. It\u2019s been an arduous few years attempting to engage Mo in banter. No offense.\u201d </p><p>Rolling her eyes a bit, Mona corrects Dan, \u201cMr <i>Novokoric</i>. And yes, it\u2019s about him. I\u2019m assuming, from your reaction earlier this morning, that you don\u2019t recognise him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr\u2026 no.\u201d </p><p>Mona clears her throat, nodding. \u201cAnd have you ever heard of Sir Nikolai Novokoric of Swtizerland?\u201d</p><p>Some distant bell rings in the back of Dan\u2019s mind. He tries to dredge up the memory that accompanies it, wrinkling his nose. \u201cIs he that party-Prince that\u2019s always in all the papers? The heir of some nobleman\u2019s fortune or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a Prince, but he is connected to the Swiss monarchy,\u201d Mona replies carefully. \u201cAnd yes, his exploits are often splashed across international entertainment news.\u201d</p><p>Not being the sort of person to indulge in celebrity gossip, Dan has only a vague sense of Sir Nikolai, but his general impression of the man is that he\u2019s a spoiled, disgustingly rich little brat, squandering his inherited fortune on hundred-thousand euro bottles of champagne to fuel his obscene sex parties in exotic locations. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really follow him,\u201d Dan says with a shrug. He\u2019s already bored just thinking about the vapid excuse for a man. He sees no reason why he should be under discussion, aside from the fact he\u2019s apparently Swiss, and they\u2019re currently atop a Swiss mountain. \u201cWhy\u2019d you bring him up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou may or may not be aware that Sir Nikolai\u2019s most recent scandal was to come out as publicly bisexual,\u201d Mona says, checking her watch and speeding up the tempo of her explanation. \u201cAnd when the scandal of this statement proved to be virtually non-existent-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwitzerland\u2019s rather blas\u00e9 about that sort of thing,\u201d Louise butts in, cheerily. \u201cSexualities and whatnot. People just sort of get on with it, round here. Doesn\u2019t matter whose pants you\u2019ve got your hand down.\u201d </p><p>\u201c-he <i>then</i> decided,\u201d Mona continues, aiming a sharp look at Louise, \u201cto hype up the scandal by eloping with a male student he met during a brief stint at a British university.\u201d </p><p>Mona\u2019s expression is carefully neutral, but from her rigid stance and the way her lips purse around the words, it\u2019s more than clear what she thinks of this impulsive, erratic behaviour. </p><p>\u201cElope?\u201d Dan asks, mildly intrigued. He\u2019d been under the impression that this rich playboy was a renowned perpetual-bachelor. \u201cSo he\u2019s married now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Dan,\u201d Louise says with a tinkling laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t know how you could\u2019ve missed it! When the media found out he\u2019d run off and wedded some nobody from Manchester they had a field day! Even I heard about it, all the way up here, where the newspapers are only delivered once a week, and that\u2019s if Kaspar even remembers to bring them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Dan says uncomfortably. \u201cI don\u2019t really follow that stuff.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, now might be the time to catch yourself up to speed,\u201d Mona says, one eyebrow raised as she surveys him, unimpressed. \u201cAs the gentleman you just attempted to accost in our lobby is Sir Nikolai\u2019s recent groom, and therefore a distant member of the Royal family.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face pales, and he places the empty bowl in his hands down, feeling suddenly nauseous. \u201cHe\u2026<i> that guy</i>?\u201d </p><p>Louise laughs, radiant and bright, bouncing off the chrome surfaces of the kitchen. Dan tries to wrap his head around the new information, feeling de-stabled. He supposes that he understands the physical appeal of the man he met just now, but surely even Sir Nikolai would be put off by the resting bitch-face, or the general rudeness. Dan expects that young men like Sir Nikolai are used to having people fawn over them; he can\u2019t imagine Mr NovaScotia-or-whatever doing anything akin to fawning. </p><p>When Dan focuses back on Mona, she\u2019s fighting an amused smile. \u201cMr Novokoric is actually quite sweet, I\u2019ve found. But he does have a rather\u2026 spiky set of barriers up, until you get to know him.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts quietly, thinking privately that he would have phrased it a little differently. Possibly he would have adopted Louise\u2019s imaginative term \u2018dick-brain\u2019. In no circumstance can Dan ever imagine being as rude to customer service staff as that man had been to him earlier. Having worked in retail and hospitality all his life, Dan is painfully aware of how shit it is to deal with irate customers; he feels that working those jobs at least once should be a rite of passage for anyone to go through, so that they can learn how to be decent human beings. He\u2019d bet that Mr Nobby-ski-head has never set foot on the other side of the till. Like his husband, he\u2019s probably an elitist twat, privately educated and living off his parents\u2019 money. </p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cYou said he was a permanent guest?\u201d </p><p>Mona nods, glancing at her watch; they\u2019ve been discussing this for too long for her liking, evidently. \u201cMore or less, yes. Our only suite is permanently rented out under Sir Nikolai\u2019s name, but his husband is the one who lives there most of the time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he have a mansion somewhere to lounge around in?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the ins and outs of it, Dan,\u201d Mona says, impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly my place to pry into such matters. All I know is that he\u2019s married to a Royal, and for whatever reason, he spends most of his days alone here, either in the suite on the top floor, or out on the slopes somewhere.\u201d </p><p>He nods, feeling strangely guilty for his probing question. He has no idea why he\u2019s interested at all, really. What\u2019s interesting about a severe, cold dick-brain with a superiority complex and no manners? Sure, he\u2019s\u2026 striking to behold, but that doesn\u2019t make him worthy of dwelling upon. </p><p>He\u2019s about to say something dismissive to this effect, but then he notices that Mona is already heading for the door. He grabs his bowl, about to speedily wash it up in the sink, but Louise snatches it from him and makes a shooing motion, then winks at him. He grins, grateful, and chucks the remains of his coffee down his throat before following Mona out of the kitchen. </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three!</a>)</b></p>",

If you were some corporate lawyer-type drowning in fast-paced city life, it would be tempting to come somewhere remote and distant, where the WiFi is shocking enough that nobody can really contact you. </p><p>\u201cSo, for this week, I\u2019m just going to have you follow me around, like you have been today,\u201d Mona explains to Dan in a hushed voice. His shift is almost over, and the evening film is just starting for the guests. She and Dan are at the back of the mezzanine lounge, stood next to the serving hatch, through which Louise is leaning, chin in her hand as she watches the opening credits roll. \u201cThat way you\u2019ll get used to the routine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0</p><p>He met Louise earlier, as he brought through the dirty plates after dinner, and though their exchange was only brief, he feels that she\u2019s the type of dry, sarcastic person he could eventually be friends with.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou say that, but Mona\u2019s a tyrant,\u201d Louise mutters, and Mona shoots her a stern look. \u201cIf you need a break from the whip-cracking, come find me. I\u2019ll keep you caffeinated, it\u2019ll make the week go faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Anyway,</i>\u201d Mona says pointedly, \u201cthings don\u2019t differ much day-to-day here, as you\u2019ll come to learn.\u201d Louise makes a grunting sound of assent. \u201cBy the end of the week, I reckon you\u2019ll have the routine down, and then we can start giving you some more independence. Manning reception on your own, that kind of thing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says, stifling a yawn. \u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think Dan might be about to fall asleep on his feet,\u201d Louise says amusedly, making Dan straighten up. </p><p>\u201cN-no, I\u2019m awake,\u201d he says hurriedly. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just not used to the long days yet, and it\u2019s dark in here-\u201d</p><p>Mona laughs, then pats him on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Dan. This job can be boring and somehow exhausting at once. You can call it a night, I\u2019ll see you bright and early.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiles at her gratefully, then yelps as Louise reaches out and pinches his arm. Two of the guests watching the movie turn around at the high-pitched squeal, making Louise giggle. </p><p>\u201cNight, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d he says, and then scurries towards the stairs. </p><p>By the time he gets to the top floor his knees are about to give way; he pauses in the hallway, digging in his pocket for his room key, more than ready for this day to be over. It hasn\u2019t been <i>awful</i>, just long and strenuous. As he pulls out the key, he notices a sliver of yellow light beneath the door of room eight, the one beside his. For a long moment, Dan stares at this light, his overtired brain struggling to work out what it could mean. Mona mentioned that she sleeps on the ground floor, in a room attached to the office. Louise and all of the other guests are still downstairs watching the film, so it can\u2019t be any of them, unless one of them inexplicably left their light on. </p><p>Too tired to consider this further, Dan lets himself into his own room, deciding he\u2019ll just ask Mona about it tomorrow. Once again, he barely makes it to the bed - though this time he does manage to pull on pyjamas - before curling up in the thick covers and letting the tears fall. </p><p>He\u2019s well into becoming a gross mess - nose running heavily, eyes piggy and sore - when he hears something odd enough to make him pause. A waft of soft, calming notes, shaping a sweet melody, filtering into his room through the wall behind his bed. He sits up against the pillows, ears straining, his face damp. He\u2019s so puzzled by the music that he forgets why he\u2019s crying, and just listens. In the stillness of the night, the music is the sole sound, worming its way beneath Dan\u2019s skin, and settling into his weary bones. </p><p>He has just enough wakefulness left in his brain to wonder how classical music could be playing at a range close enough for him to hear right now, considering everyone else is supposedly downstairs watching <i>Ocean\u2019s Eleven</i>. Before he can think of any answer, however, he is slipping down into the mattress, and then right through it, until he\u2019s floating into a sea of dream. </p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock in the evening, and Dan\u2019s second day is winding down. He is at the front desk, which he\u2019s beginning to recognise as his base camp for the times of day when he\u2019s without pressing tasks - which is often. Mona\u2019s base camp is the office behind the reception desk, where she does scary managerial business like handling the accounts and speaking to investors.\u00a0</p><p>At the moment Mona is upstairs in the kitchen, asking Louise to make she and Dan something to eat, as the dinner rush is over now. Just as Dan is about to give in and dig in his pocket for his phone to alleviate the boredom, he hears the back door that leads to the jacuzzi and sauna opening. The door is around the corner from the reception desk, hidden from Dan\u2019s view, but he straightens in his seat nonetheless, preparing to make polite small talk with one of the guests. </p><p>To his total astonishment, a man walks into the lobby that he has never seen before. He\u2019s wearing one of the robes left for guests in each room, as well as the complimentary slippers. The robe is loosely tied around his waist, as if it might undo itself any moment, and reveal the long, toned, naked body beneath. His black hair is wet, dripping to his shoulders. As he passes the desk, he aims a vague smile at what he clearly assumes will be Mona, as when he sees Dan sat there, he does a double take. </p><p>Fixed in place by two inhumanly blue eyes, Dan cannot find a single word to utter. This man is an apparition, serene and impossible. How is he here? Dan has met all of the guests and staff. Mona would surely have told him if there were anyone else by this point. They are up the side of a mountain, with no means of being reached save for a private plane or a death-defying cable car ride, so he can\u2019t be an intruder, yet Dan cannot think of another explanation. He thinks of shouting for Mona, but still he cannot summon his voice. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the man says, half-mumbled. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t stop walking, so Dan has no chance to respond even if he could, and then the man is climbing the stairs to the mezzanine, and disappearing out of sight. Ten minutes later, when Mona reappears, Dan explains to her what just happened in a rush, the words spilling out as if whatever had stoppered them up before has been violently uncorked at her reappearance. </p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Mona says, clearing her throat. She hands him a bowl of what looks like chilli, with a slice of crusty bread. \u201cThat\u2019s Mr Novokoric,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s our\u2026 special guest. Don\u2019t concern yourself with him right now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guest?\u201d </p><p>Mona hesitates. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t come for breakfast,\u201d Dan points out, bewildered. \u201cOr lunch, or dinner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Novokoric has his meals in his room,\u201d Mona says briskly, fidgeting with obvious discomfort. \u201cWhen he eats at all, that is,\u201d she mutters, lower. \u201cI will explain about all that later, Dan,\u201d she promises. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s just focus on the main aspects of the job, getting your routine in place\u2026\u201d </p><p>She rambles on about the responsibilities he\u2019s still getting to terms with, and he half-listens, unable to stop the hundreds of questions about this mysterious \u2018other\u2019 guest from swooshing around in his mind. With a lot of effort, and mostly because he feels his and Mona\u2019s professional relationship is still in its infancy, he swallows his curiosity down with a spoonful of piping hot chilli. </p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Dan\u2019s third working at The Secret of the Alps, he is up even earlier than usual. He\u2019d gotten more sleep than his previous two nights, thanks to the music that again drifted through the wall to staunch his free-flowing tears.\u00a0</p><p>The light filtering through the window is still too startling to ignore however, so he abandons any attempt at staying in bed, and dresses quickly, hoping to impress Mona with his work ethic by getting an extra early start. Sure enough, he\u2019s the first one to reach the front desk, though he can hear Mona in her room at the back of the office shuffling around - perhaps gluing her unmoving bun in position with industrial strength adhesive. Whatever she\u2019s up to, Dan knows he doesn\u2019t have long before she emerges, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, so he sets himself up at the desk and attempts to look productive. As he skims through the hotel brochure, scanning photos of happy families in bobble-hats, and wine-flushed couples in front of log fires, his mind wanders back down the mountain, to his old life - his real life - which lurks menacingly below him, claws outstretched, ready to snatch him back the moment he peeks over the precipice. </p><p>He hears vague footsteps on the stairs, and assumes it must be Louise, as she\u2019s the only other person he could conceive might be up this early. He and Louise have struck up an instant colloquial rapport which he\u2019s grateful for, even in the few days he\u2019s been here, so Dan says, without looking up, \u201cunngh, need caffeine, Lou. I\u2019ll tip my head back and you just pour the coffee down my throat, kay?\u201d </p><p>He expects, of course, one of Louise\u2019s snarky yet fond comebacks, probably focused on how inadvertently sexual that request sounded. He waits for the cut of her steel tongue, but it doesn\u2019t come. \u00a0Dan looks up, and meets the two vibrant blue eyes he remembers from yesterday evening, over which two dark eyebrows are arched high on a pale, exposed forehead. At once, Dan flushes, shutting the brochure with a slap, and sitting up straighter in his chair. </p><p>\u201cOh, God, sorry, I thought you were someone else. Um, good morning-\u201d Dan struggles to recall the name Mona had given this man last night - Novak? Novorak? He\u2019s not sure. \u201c\u2026Sir.\u201d Best to be on the safe side. \u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d </p><p>The blue-eyed man doesn\u2019t pause, crossing the lobby towards the door, but he does shake his head slightly in response to Dan\u2019s question. He\u2019s a startling thing to behold so early in the morning. His shock of onyx hair contrasts against the scarlet snow-jacket he\u2019s wearing. It takes Dan a moment for his eyes to adjust to the sheer vibrancy of him, and an even longer moment to realise that tucked beneath his arm are two cherry-red skis. </p><p><i>Skiing and snowboarding is not a good idea up here</i>, Mona\u2019s voice echoes in his head. <i>The mountain is treacherous and unpredictable, so stress that to guests\u2026</i></p><p>Dan jumps to his feet at once, heart already in his throat as he watches the man nearing the front door, apparently about to walk outside and strap those skis to his feet, then most likely hurl himself to his untimely death. </p><p>\u201cOh, S-Sir, hold on,\u201d Dan calls out, jogging out from the desk and over towards the man, who has turned to him with such an expression of astonishment that it\u2019s as if Dan had begun to perform a striptease right in the middle of the lobby. \u201cS-sorry,\u201d Dan says, stepping towards him more cautiously now, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not allowed to ski here.\u201d </p><p>One of those dark eyebrows arches upwards again. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not permitted for guests to ski,\u201d Dan says hurriedly; he can feel a steady blossoming of burst capillaries in either cheek. \u201cThe mountain is, um,\u201d what did Mona say? \u201c\u2026treacherous. You could be hurt.\u201d</p><p>A long moment passes, during which time Dan begins to wonder if maybe he should repeat himself, slower, as perhaps this man doesn\u2019t understand English very well. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d the man asks eventually, in the sort of voice Dan recognises from all the times he\u2019s dealt with petulant, \u2018I-want-to-speak-to-the-manager\u2019 type middle-aged women in the retail jobs he\u2019s worked. </p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he replies, swallowing. </p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re the new concierge, Dan?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 yes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The man hitches his skis up into the crook of his arm. \u201cI suggest that next time you decide you have any right to come up and reprimand me, that you consult with your boss before making a fool of yourself.\u201d </p><p>He says this in such a calm monotone that it takes Dan a few seconds to realise how rudely he\u2019s just been spoken to. He blushes again, absurdly. \u201cI-I\u2019m really very sorry, Sir, but I can\u2019t allow you to leave the hotel with those skis.\u201d</p><p>The man fixes him with a glare that would put the Real Housewives to shame. \u201cAnd what is it that you\u2019re going to do to stop me, Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ll, um-\u201d </p><p>Dan is saved from finishing this sentence by the sound of Mona\u2019s kitten heels tapping hurriedly across the wooden floor. As she gets closer, Dan can hear that she is muttering \u201coh, dear god\u201d repeatedly under her breath. Relieved that he is no longer on his own in this situation, Dan takes a subtle step backwards from the hostile guest. He averts his gaze from those hard, cold blue eyes as he waits for Mona to assert her prim, managerial dominance over this man, and confiscate his forbidden sports equipment. </p><p>\u201cI am <i>so</i> sorry Mr Novokoric,\u201d she blurts, much to Dan\u2019s horror. \u201cPlease forgive Dan, he only arrived yesterday and isn\u2019t yet aware of your special circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Mr Novokoric huffs an impatient sigh, but nods tightly. \u201cMight I recommend offering treats to help him learn faster.\u201d </p><p>\u201cVery funny, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Mona says with a polite, false-sounding laugh. Dan\u2019s cheeks are now rivalling the man\u2019s jacket, he\u2019s certain. Surely he can\u2019t have just implied Dan were a <i>dog</i>, and Mona is simply <i>laughing</i>. To Dan\u2019s abject bafflement, she then seems to actually give a small bow of her head. Where is his stern, no-nonsense, manageress in shining armour? This is not the same woman he recognises from the last two days. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Dan up to speed in no time. This won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric nods again, sliding a final, disapproving look towards Dan for good measure before muttering something like \u2018alright then\u2019, and slipping out of the door. As soon as Dan is relatively sure the man is out of earshot, he turns to Mona, scandalised. </p><p>\u201cPlease explain to me what just happened,\u201d he says, as calmly as he can manage given that he is utterly seething. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mona says, then considers this. \u201cWell, yes, but you weren\u2019t to know. It\u2019s my fault, I was trying to ease you in, but I should have discussed Mr Novokoric\u2019s special case sooner. I apologise for that. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d have the chance to speak to him without me being there.\u201d </p><p>Dan waits for her to continue, but she simply turns away, strolling determinedly back towards the desk, and nimbly side-stepping the entire issue. \u201cWell, I would appreciate being filled in now,\u201d Dan says, hot on her heels. \u201cI don\u2019t fancy being on the receiving end of one of Mr Nobby-whatsit\u2019s glacial stares again any time soon.\u201d </p><p>Mona sighs, smoothing down the non-existent stray hairs from her high bun. \u201cAll right,\u201d she says after a moment of deliberation. She gestures for him to follow her, and moves towards the stairs up to the mezzanine. \u201cCome up and have some breakfast. We can discuss it - briefly - as we eat.\u201d </p><p>For some reason, Dan\u2019s heart is fluttering in his chest. He tries to imagine what possible secrets are about to be revealed to him surrounding this mysterious, moody ski-enthusiast. Perhaps Mr Novo-whatever is some sort of secret agent, using his skis to swoop from mission to mission. Or perhaps he\u2019s a mentally-unstable ex-patient of some nearby facility that could no longer afford to keep him due to his hostile nature. </p><p>He\u2019s so caught up in these various possibilities that he doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s followed Mona into the kitchen until Louise is pushing a bowl of porridge into his hands. The letter \u2018D\u2019 is drizzled on top in syrup, and there are blueberries scattered across the surface. </p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d he says, chuffed. He aims a grateful smile at Louise. \u201cD for Dan?\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head to one side, frowning. \u201cHuh. Didn\u2019t think of that. I was going for Dick-brain.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, but digs straight in; it\u2019s thick, warm and sweet. \u201cOrgasmic as usual, Lou. Got any coffee to go with it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s blueberry, honey and cinnamon,\u201d Louise tells him enthusiastically, her front two gap-teeth bared. She\u2019s already at the coffee machine, turning vials and spurting steam without needing to look at what she\u2019s doing. \u201cIs it the best porridge you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d</p><p>He considers this for a moment, then bites down on a blueberry, which bursts out a tangy, tart flavour that mixes so deliciously with the sweet syrup, that Dan actually moans. \u201cOh, hands down.\u201d </p><p>Pleased with this response, Louise makes his coffee double strength, which Dan notices, and hopes Mona doesn\u2019t. \u201cI like this one, Mo,\u201d Louise calls over the hissing of steam as she makes Mona a cappuccino. \u201cDon\u2019t go scaring him off like you did the last one.\u201d </p><p>Dan wonders if the failure and possible trauma of his predecessor should alarm him, but finds that he\u2019s too busy enjoying the blissful experience of Louise\u2019s porridge to really care. Besides, he\u2019s already here now, has already given up his life back in England to do this; it\u2019s going to have to be something really stupendously terrifying to chase him back to the ruins of what he left behind. </p><p>\u201cI did not scare that little nitwit off,\u201d Mona says sniffily. \u201cShe was far too sensitive. I only told her she couldn\u2019t fold a towel to save her life. Which is not true of Dan, so it\u2019s all fine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Louise says, pouring foam. She walks over and hands the cappuccino to Mona, giving her a look. \u201cJust don\u2019t hurl him into the deep end without a life raft.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I <i>was</i> trying to ease him in,\u201d Mona says with a heavy sigh. She blows on the coffee, then plucks a teaspoon from nearby and scoops some froth into her mouth. \u201cBut I took my eye off him for two seconds and he went squaring up to the beast.\u201d </p><p>Louise makes a face halfway between a grimace and a grin, turning to Dan. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve met His Lordship, then?\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts into his near-empty bowl. \u201cIs that what you call him? He does act as if he\u2019s Royalty.\u201d Mona and Louise exchange a look so loaded with unspoken <i>somethings</i> that Dan actually pauses, spoon of porridge halfway to his mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Louise chuckles, seemingly to herself, and turns to uncover what looks like a delicious homemade loaf of bread, which she immediately begins sawing into thick slices for the guest breakfast. Dan turns to Mona, sensing that Louise is not going to be the forthcoming one here. Mona\u2019s fidgeting, which seems unusual for her, not that Dan is the best judge given that he\u2019s only known her forty-eight hours. </p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d she says eventually, seeming to navigate some internal minefield of appropriate phrasing. \u201cI know we\u2019ve only just met, but there\u2019s something I need to ask of you.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods slowly, aware that Louise is watching him, though she\u2019s trying very hard to pretend she\u2019s focused solely on the bread. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says warily. </p><p>\u201cI understand it\u2019s a bit early to ask you to commit, but\u2026 do you think you\u2019d be interested in permanently accepting this job?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 yes,\u201d Dan says. Briefly, he thinks of his final discussion with his father, the gist of which had been <i>\u2018if you do something as stupid and reckless as pissing off to waste your time up the top of a snowy hill, I\u2019ll disown you\u2019</i>. Even that lovely parting sentiment hadn\u2019t managed to dissuade Dan from coming here though, so he supposes he must really be serious about his decision to do this. \u201cI\u2019m not going to back out, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d </p><p>Mona casts a brief, relieved look in Louise\u2019s direction, which is happily returned. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s very good to hear, Dan. Okay then,\u201d she says, placing her cup of coffee down carefully in order to clasp her hands together at her waist. \u201cWhat I need to ask you, in that case, is for your total discretion. I need your word, unwaveringly, to keep quiet about a certain matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about Mr Novocaine?\u201d </p><p>Louise\u2019s bark of laughter is shrill and high. \u201cAt last! I have someone on my level of comedic talent to witticise with. It\u2019s been an arduous few years attempting to engage Mo in banter. No offense.\u201d </p><p>Rolling her eyes a bit, Mona corrects Dan, \u201cMr <i>Novokoric</i>. And yes, it\u2019s about him. I\u2019m assuming, from your reaction earlier this morning, that you don\u2019t recognise him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr\u2026 no.\u201d </p><p>Mona clears her throat, nodding. \u201cAnd have you ever heard of Sir Nikolai Novokoric of Swtizerland?\u201d</p><p>Some distant bell rings in the back of Dan\u2019s mind. He tries to dredge up the memory that accompanies it, wrinkling his nose. \u201cIs he that party-Prince that\u2019s always in all the papers? The heir of some nobleman\u2019s fortune or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a Prince, but he is connected to the Swiss monarchy,\u201d Mona replies carefully. \u201cAnd yes, his exploits are often splashed across international entertainment news.\u201d</p><p>Not being the sort of person to indulge in celebrity gossip, Dan has only a vague sense of Sir Nikolai, but his general impression of the man is that he\u2019s a spoiled, disgustingly rich little brat, squandering his inherited fortune on hundred-thousand euro bottles of champagne to fuel his obscene sex parties in exotic locations. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really follow him,\u201d Dan says with a shrug. He\u2019s already bored just thinking about the vapid excuse for a man. He sees no reason why he should be under discussion, aside from the fact he\u2019s apparently Swiss, and they\u2019re currently atop a Swiss mountain. \u201cWhy\u2019d you bring him up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou may or may not be aware that Sir Nikolai\u2019s most recent scandal was to come out as publicly bisexual,\u201d Mona says, checking her watch and speeding up the tempo of her explanation. \u201cAnd when the scandal of this statement proved to be virtually non-existent-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwitzerland\u2019s rather blas\u00e9 about that sort of thing,\u201d Louise butts in, cheerily. \u201cSexualities and whatnot. People just sort of get on with it, round here. Doesn\u2019t matter whose pants you\u2019ve got your hand down.\u201d </p><p>\u201c-he <i>then</i> decided,\u201d Mona continues, aiming a sharp look at Louise, \u201cto hype up the scandal by eloping with a male student he met during a brief stint at a British university.\u201d </p><p>Mona\u2019s expression is carefully neutral, but from her rigid stance and the way her lips purse around the words, it\u2019s more than clear what she thinks of this impulsive, erratic behaviour. </p><p>\u201cElope?\u201d Dan asks, mildly intrigued. He\u2019d been under the impression that this rich playboy was a renowned perpetual-bachelor. \u201cSo he\u2019s married now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Dan,\u201d Louise says with a tinkling laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t know how you could\u2019ve missed it! When the media found out he\u2019d run off and wedded some nobody from Manchester they had a field day! Even I heard about it, all the way up here, where the newspapers are only delivered once a week, and that\u2019s if Kaspar even remembers to bring them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Dan says uncomfortably. \u201cI don\u2019t really follow that stuff.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, now might be the time to catch yourself up to speed,\u201d Mona says, one eyebrow raised as she surveys him, unimpressed. \u201cAs the gentleman you just attempted to accost in our lobby is Sir Nikolai\u2019s recent groom, and therefore a distant member of the Royal family.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face pales, and he places the empty bowl in his hands down, feeling suddenly nauseous. \u201cHe\u2026<i> that guy</i>?\u201d </p><p>Louise laughs, radiant and bright, bouncing off the chrome surfaces of the kitchen. Dan tries to wrap his head around the new information, feeling de-stabled. He supposes that he understands the physical appeal of the man he met just now, but surely even Sir Nikolai would be put off by the resting bitch-face, or the general rudeness. Dan expects that young men like Sir Nikolai are used to having people fawn over them; he can\u2019t imagine Mr NovaScotia-or-whatever doing anything akin to fawning. </p><p>When Dan focuses back on Mona, she\u2019s fighting an amused smile. \u201cMr Novokoric is actually quite sweet, I\u2019ve found. But he does have a rather\u2026 spiky set of barriers up, until you get to know him.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts quietly, thinking privately that he would have phrased it a little differently. Possibly he would have adopted Louise\u2019s imaginative term \u2018dick-brain\u2019. In no circumstance can Dan ever imagine being as rude to customer service staff as that man had been to him earlier. Having worked in retail and hospitality all his life, Dan is painfully aware of how shit it is to deal with irate customers; he feels that working those jobs at least once should be a rite of passage for anyone to go through, so that they can learn how to be decent human beings. He\u2019d bet that Mr Nobby-ski-head has never set foot on the other side of the till. Like his husband, he\u2019s probably an elitist twat, privately educated and living off his parents\u2019 money. </p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cYou said he was a permanent guest?\u201d </p><p>Mona nods, glancing at her watch; they\u2019ve been discussing this for too long for her liking, evidently. \u201cMore or less, yes. Our only suite is permanently rented out under Sir Nikolai\u2019s name, but his husband is the one who lives there most of the time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he have a mansion somewhere to lounge around in?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the ins and outs of it, Dan,\u201d Mona says, impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly my place to pry into such matters. All I know is that he\u2019s married to a Royal, and for whatever reason, he spends most of his days alone here, either in the suite on the top floor, or out on the slopes somewhere.\u201d </p><p>He nods, feeling strangely guilty for his probing question. He has no idea why he\u2019s interested at all, really. What\u2019s interesting about a severe, cold dick-brain with a superiority complex and no manners? Sure, he\u2019s\u2026 striking to behold, but that doesn\u2019t make him worthy of dwelling upon. </p><p>He\u2019s about to say something dismissive to this effect, but then he notices that Mona is already heading for the door. He grabs his bowl, about to speedily wash it up in the sink, but Louise snatches it from him and makes a shooing motion, then winks at him. He grins, grateful, and chucks the remains of his coffee down his throat before following Mona out of the kitchen. </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three!</a>)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most. </i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a></p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p>After Dan and Mona have served breakfast to the two - yes, just two - couples staying at the hotel, they clear everything away, leaving the tablecloths out for the lunch service in a few hours. As they are pretty much cut off from civilisation up here, guests are served three meals a day, along with optional extra nibbles sent to their rooms upon request. It takes Dan a full day of quietly observing, but he eventually comes to understand that The Secret of the Alps is not a place people come for adventure, or entertainment.<br></p><p>The hotel is instead a serene, atmospheric getaway, isolated high up in the scenic Swiss Alps, away from the stresses of civilisation. People come here not for planned activities, but to spend time alone, or with each other, reading books by the fire, playing scrabble, or taking the occasional guided walk around the safe paths of the mountain. These walks are led by Kaspar, who can be called up a day in advance. There\u2019s a jacuzzi and sauna outside at the back of the hotel for guests to enjoy, a small gym, and a lounge stocked with a wide range of books and board games as Dan has seen. Louise is available for cooking classes if guests are interested, and each night Mona puts on a film for the guests in the mezzanine area; Louise makes buttery popcorn and Bailey\u2019s hot chocolate for everyone, and if people are feeling social, sometimes they loiter there well into the night, chatting. </p>[[MORE]]<p>It\u2019s probably not what Dan would choose for a holiday, but he understands the appeal. If you were some corporate lawyer-type drowning in fast-paced city life, it would be tempting to come somewhere remote and distant, where the WiFi is shocking enough that nobody can really contact you. </p><p>\u201cSo, for this week, I\u2019m just going to have you follow me around, like you have been today,\u201d Mona explains to Dan in a hushed voice. His shift is almost over, and the evening film is just starting for the guests. She and Dan are at the back of the mezzanine lounge, stood next to the serving hatch, through which Louise is leaning, chin in her hand as she watches the opening credits roll. \u201cThat way you\u2019ll get used to the routine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0</p><p>He met Louise earlier, as he brought through the dirty plates after dinner, and though their exchange was only brief, he feels that she\u2019s the type of dry, sarcastic person he could eventually be friends with.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou say that, but Mona\u2019s a tyrant,\u201d Louise mutters, and Mona shoots her a stern look. \u201cIf you need a break from the whip-cracking, come find me. I\u2019ll keep you caffeinated, it\u2019ll make the week go faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Anyway,</i>\u201d Mona says pointedly, \u201cthings don\u2019t differ much day-to-day here, as you\u2019ll come to learn.\u201d Louise makes a grunting sound of assent. \u201cBy the end of the week, I reckon you\u2019ll have the routine down, and then we can start giving you some more independence. Manning reception on your own, that kind of thing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan says, stifling a yawn. \u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think Dan might be about to fall asleep on his feet,\u201d Louise says amusedly, making Dan straighten up. </p><p>\u201cN-no, I\u2019m awake,\u201d he says hurriedly. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just not used to the long days yet, and it\u2019s dark in here-\u201d</p><p>Mona laughs, then pats him on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Dan. This job can be boring and somehow exhausting at once. You can call it a night, I\u2019ll see you bright and early.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiles at her gratefully, then yelps as Louise reaches out and pinches his arm. Two of the guests watching the movie turn around at the high-pitched squeal, making Louise giggle. </p><p>\u201cNight, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d he says, and then scurries towards the stairs. </p><p>By the time he gets to the top floor his knees are about to give way; he pauses in the hallway, digging in his pocket for his room key, more than ready for this day to be over. It hasn\u2019t been <i>awful</i>, just long and strenuous. As he pulls out the key, he notices a sliver of yellow light beneath the door of room eight, the one beside his. For a long moment, Dan stares at this light, his overtired brain struggling to work out what it could mean. Mona mentioned that she sleeps on the ground floor, in a room attached to the office. Louise and all of the other guests are still downstairs watching the film, so it can\u2019t be any of them, unless one of them inexplicably left their light on. </p><p>Too tired to consider this further, Dan lets himself into his own room, deciding he\u2019ll just ask Mona about it tomorrow. Once again, he barely makes it to the bed - though this time he does manage to pull on pyjamas - before curling up in the thick covers and letting the tears fall. </p><p>He\u2019s well into becoming a gross mess - nose running heavily, eyes piggy and sore - when he hears something odd enough to make him pause. A waft of soft, calming notes, shaping a sweet melody, filtering into his room through the wall behind his bed. He sits up against the pillows, ears straining, his face damp. He\u2019s so puzzled by the music that he forgets why he\u2019s crying, and just listens. In the stillness of the night, the music is the sole sound, worming its way beneath Dan\u2019s skin, and settling into his weary bones. </p><p>He has just enough wakefulness left in his brain to wonder how classical music could be playing at a range close enough for him to hear right now, considering everyone else is supposedly downstairs watching <i>Ocean\u2019s Eleven</i>. Before he can think of any answer, however, he is slipping down into the mattress, and then right through it, until he\u2019s floating into a sea of dream. </p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock in the evening, and Dan\u2019s second day is winding down. He is at the front desk, which he\u2019s beginning to recognise as his base camp for the times of day when he\u2019s without pressing tasks - which is often. Mona\u2019s base camp is the office behind the reception desk, where she does scary managerial business like handling the accounts and speaking to investors.\u00a0</p><p>At the moment Mona is upstairs in the kitchen, asking Louise to make she and Dan something to eat, as the dinner rush is over now. Just as Dan is about to give in and dig in his pocket for his phone to alleviate the boredom, he hears the back door that leads to the jacuzzi and sauna opening. The door is around the corner from the reception desk, hidden from Dan\u2019s view, but he straightens in his seat nonetheless, preparing to make polite small talk with one of the guests. </p><p>To his total astonishment, a man walks into the lobby that he has never seen before. He\u2019s wearing one of the robes left for guests in each room, as well as the complimentary slippers. The robe is loosely tied around his waist, as if it might undo itself any moment, and reveal the long, toned, naked body beneath. His black hair is wet, dripping to his shoulders. As he passes the desk, he aims a vague smile at what he clearly assumes will be Mona, as when he sees Dan sat there, he does a double take. </p><p>Fixed in place by two inhumanly blue eyes, Dan cannot find a single word to utter. This man is an apparition, serene and impossible. How is he here? Dan has met all of the guests and staff. Mona would surely have told him if there were anyone else by this point. They are up the side of a mountain, with no means of being reached save for a private plane or a death-defying cable car ride, so he can\u2019t be an intruder, yet Dan cannot think of another explanation. He thinks of shouting for Mona, but still he cannot summon his voice. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the man says, half-mumbled. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t stop walking, so Dan has no chance to respond even if he could, and then the man is climbing the stairs to the mezzanine, and disappearing out of sight. Ten minutes later, when Mona reappears, Dan explains to her what just happened in a rush, the words spilling out as if whatever had stoppered them up before has been violently uncorked at her reappearance. </p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Mona says, clearing her throat. She hands him a bowl of what looks like chilli, with a slice of crusty bread. \u201cThat\u2019s Mr Novokoric,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s our\u2026 special guest. Don\u2019t concern yourself with him right now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guest?\u201d </p><p>Mona hesitates. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t come for breakfast,\u201d Dan points out, bewildered. \u201cOr lunch, or dinner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Novokoric has his meals in his room,\u201d Mona says briskly, fidgeting with obvious discomfort. \u201cWhen he eats at all, that is,\u201d she mutters, lower. \u201cI will explain about all that later, Dan,\u201d she promises. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s just focus on the main aspects of the job, getting your routine in place\u2026\u201d </p><p>She rambles on about the responsibilities he\u2019s still getting to terms with, and he half-listens, unable to stop the hundreds of questions about this mysterious \u2018other\u2019 guest from swooshing around in his mind. With a lot of effort, and mostly because he feels his and Mona\u2019s professional relationship is still in its infancy, he swallows his curiosity down with a spoonful of piping hot chilli. </p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Dan\u2019s third working at The Secret of the Alps, he is up even earlier than usual. He\u2019d gotten more sleep than his previous two nights, thanks to the music that again drifted through the wall to staunch his free-flowing tears.\u00a0</p><p>The light filtering through the window is still too startling to ignore however, so he abandons any attempt at staying in bed, and dresses quickly, hoping to impress Mona with his work ethic by getting an extra early start. Sure enough, he\u2019s the first one to reach the front desk, though he can hear Mona in her room at the back of the office shuffling around - perhaps gluing her unmoving bun in position with industrial strength adhesive. Whatever she\u2019s up to, Dan knows he doesn\u2019t have long before she emerges, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, so he sets himself up at the desk and attempts to look productive. As he skims through the hotel brochure, scanning photos of happy families in bobble-hats, and wine-flushed couples in front of log fires, his mind wanders back down the mountain, to his old life - his real life - which lurks menacingly below him, claws outstretched, ready to snatch him back the moment he peeks over the precipice. </p><p>He hears vague footsteps on the stairs, and assumes it must be Louise, as she\u2019s the only other person he could conceive might be up this early. He and Louise have struck up an instant colloquial rapport which he\u2019s grateful for, even in the few days he\u2019s been here, so Dan says, without looking up, \u201cunngh, need caffeine, Lou. I\u2019ll tip my head back and you just pour the coffee down my throat, kay?\u201d </p><p>He expects, of course, one of Louise\u2019s snarky yet fond comebacks, probably focused on how inadvertently sexual that request sounded. He waits for the cut of her steel tongue, but it doesn\u2019t come. \u00a0Dan looks up, and meets the two vibrant blue eyes he remembers from yesterday evening, over which two dark eyebrows are arched high on a pale, exposed forehead. At once, Dan flushes, shutting the brochure with a slap, and sitting up straighter in his chair. </p><p>\u201cOh, God, sorry, I thought you were someone else. Um, good morning-\u201d Dan struggles to recall the name Mona had given this man last night - Novak? Novorak? He\u2019s not sure. \u201c\u2026Sir.\u201d Best to be on the safe side. \u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d </p><p>The blue-eyed man doesn\u2019t pause, crossing the lobby towards the door, but he does shake his head slightly in response to Dan\u2019s question. He\u2019s a startling thing to behold so early in the morning. His shock of onyx hair contrasts against the scarlet snow-jacket he\u2019s wearing. It takes Dan a moment for his eyes to adjust to the sheer vibrancy of him, and an even longer moment to realise that tucked beneath his arm are two cherry-red skis. </p><p><i>Skiing and snowboarding is not a good idea up here</i>, Mona\u2019s voice echoes in his head. <i>The mountain is treacherous and unpredictable, so stress that to guests\u2026</i></p><p>Dan jumps to his feet at once, heart already in his throat as he watches the man nearing the front door, apparently about to walk outside and strap those skis to his feet, then most likely hurl himself to his untimely death. </p><p>\u201cOh, S-Sir, hold on,\u201d Dan calls out, jogging out from the desk and over towards the man, who has turned to him with such an expression of astonishment that it\u2019s as if Dan had begun to perform a striptease right in the middle of the lobby. \u201cS-sorry,\u201d Dan says, stepping towards him more cautiously now, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not allowed to ski here.\u201d </p><p>One of those dark eyebrows arches upwards again. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not permitted for guests to ski,\u201d Dan says hurriedly; he can feel a steady blossoming of burst capillaries in either cheek. \u201cThe mountain is, um,\u201d what did Mona say? \u201c\u2026treacherous. You could be hurt.\u201d</p><p>A long moment passes, during which time Dan begins to wonder if maybe he should repeat himself, slower, as perhaps this man doesn\u2019t understand English very well. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d the man asks eventually, in the sort of voice Dan recognises from all the times he\u2019s dealt with petulant, \u2018I-want-to-speak-to-the-manager\u2019 type middle-aged women in the retail jobs he\u2019s worked. </p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d he replies, swallowing. </p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re the new concierge, Dan?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 yes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The man hitches his skis up into the crook of his arm. \u201cI suggest that next time you decide you have any right to come up and reprimand me, that you consult with your boss before making a fool of yourself.\u201d </p><p>He says this in such a calm monotone that it takes Dan a few seconds to realise how rudely he\u2019s just been spoken to. He blushes again, absurdly. \u201cI-I\u2019m really very sorry, Sir, but I can\u2019t allow you to leave the hotel with those skis.\u201d</p><p>The man fixes him with a glare that would put the Real Housewives to shame. \u201cAnd what is it that you\u2019re going to do to stop me, Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ll, um-\u201d </p><p>Dan is saved from finishing this sentence by the sound of Mona\u2019s kitten heels tapping hurriedly across the wooden floor. As she gets closer, Dan can hear that she is muttering \u201coh, dear god\u201d repeatedly under her breath. Relieved that he is no longer on his own in this situation, Dan takes a subtle step backwards from the hostile guest. He averts his gaze from those hard, cold blue eyes as he waits for Mona to assert her prim, managerial dominance over this man, and confiscate his forbidden sports equipment. </p><p>\u201cI am <i>so</i> sorry Mr Novokoric,\u201d she blurts, much to Dan\u2019s horror. \u201cPlease forgive Dan, he only arrived yesterday and isn\u2019t yet aware of your special circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Mr Novokoric huffs an impatient sigh, but nods tightly. \u201cMight I recommend offering treats to help him learn faster.\u201d </p><p>\u201cVery funny, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Mona says with a polite, false-sounding laugh. Dan\u2019s cheeks are now rivalling the man\u2019s jacket, he\u2019s certain. Surely he can\u2019t have just implied Dan were a <i>dog</i>, and Mona is simply <i>laughing</i>. To Dan\u2019s abject bafflement, she then seems to actually give a small bow of her head. Where is his stern, no-nonsense, manageress in shining armour? This is not the same woman he recognises from the last two days. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Dan up to speed in no time. This won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric nods again, sliding a final, disapproving look towards Dan for good measure before muttering something like \u2018alright then\u2019, and slipping out of the door. As soon as Dan is relatively sure the man is out of earshot, he turns to Mona, scandalised. </p><p>\u201cPlease explain to me what just happened,\u201d he says, as calmly as he can manage given that he is utterly seething. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mona says, then considers this. \u201cWell, yes, but you weren\u2019t to know. It\u2019s my fault, I was trying to ease you in, but I should have discussed Mr Novokoric\u2019s special case sooner. I apologise for that. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d have the chance to speak to him without me being there.\u201d </p><p>Dan waits for her to continue, but she simply turns away, strolling determinedly back towards the desk, and nimbly side-stepping the entire issue. \u201cWell, I would appreciate being filled in now,\u201d Dan says, hot on her heels. \u201cI don\u2019t fancy being on the receiving end of one of Mr Nobby-whatsit\u2019s glacial stares again any time soon.\u201d </p><p>Mona sighs, smoothing down the non-existent stray hairs from her high bun. \u201cAll right,\u201d she says after a moment of deliberation. She gestures for him to follow her, and moves towards the stairs up to the mezzanine. \u201cCome up and have some breakfast. We can discuss it - briefly - as we eat.\u201d </p><p>For some reason, Dan\u2019s heart is fluttering in his chest. He tries to imagine what possible secrets are about to be revealed to him surrounding this mysterious, moody ski-enthusiast. Perhaps Mr Novo-whatever is some sort of secret agent, using his skis to swoop from mission to mission. Or perhaps he\u2019s a mentally-unstable ex-patient of some nearby facility that could no longer afford to keep him due to his hostile nature. </p><p>He\u2019s so caught up in these various possibilities that he doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s followed Mona into the kitchen until Louise is pushing a bowl of porridge into his hands. The letter \u2018D\u2019 is drizzled on top in syrup, and there are blueberries scattered across the surface. </p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d he says, chuffed. He aims a grateful smile at Louise. \u201cD for Dan?\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head to one side, frowning. \u201cHuh. Didn\u2019t think of that. I was going for Dick-brain.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, but digs straight in; it\u2019s thick, warm and sweet. \u201cOrgasmic as usual, Lou. Got any coffee to go with it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s blueberry, honey and cinnamon,\u201d Louise tells him enthusiastically, her front two gap-teeth bared. She\u2019s already at the coffee machine, turning vials and spurting steam without needing to look at what she\u2019s doing. \u201cIs it the best porridge you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d</p><p>He considers this for a moment, then bites down on a blueberry, which bursts out a tangy, tart flavour that mixes so deliciously with the sweet syrup, that Dan actually moans. \u201cOh, hands down.\u201d </p><p>Pleased with this response, Louise makes his coffee double strength, which Dan notices, and hopes Mona doesn\u2019t. \u201cI like this one, Mo,\u201d Louise calls over the hissing of steam as she makes Mona a cappuccino. \u201cDon\u2019t go scaring him off like you did the last one.\u201d </p><p>Dan wonders if the failure and possible trauma of his predecessor should alarm him, but finds that he\u2019s too busy enjoying the blissful experience of Louise\u2019s porridge to really care. Besides, he\u2019s already here now, has already given up his life back in England to do this; it\u2019s going to have to be something really stupendously terrifying to chase him back to the ruins of what he left behind. </p><p>\u201cI did not scare that little nitwit off,\u201d Mona says sniffily. \u201cShe was far too sensitive. I only told her she couldn\u2019t fold a towel to save her life. Which is not true of Dan, so it\u2019s all fine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Louise says, pouring foam. She walks over and hands the cappuccino to Mona, giving her a look. \u201cJust don\u2019t hurl him into the deep end without a life raft.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I <i>was</i> trying to ease him in,\u201d Mona says with a heavy sigh. She blows on the coffee, then plucks a teaspoon from nearby and scoops some froth into her mouth. \u201cBut I took my eye off him for two seconds and he went squaring up to the beast.\u201d </p><p>Louise makes a face halfway between a grimace and a grin, turning to Dan. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve met His Lordship, then?\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts into his near-empty bowl. \u201cIs that what you call him? He does act as if he\u2019s Royalty.\u201d Mona and Louise exchange a look so loaded with unspoken <i>somethings</i> that Dan actually pauses, spoon of porridge halfway to his mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Louise chuckles, seemingly to herself, and turns to uncover what looks like a delicious homemade loaf of bread, which she immediately begins sawing into thick slices for the guest breakfast. Dan turns to Mona, sensing that Louise is not going to be the forthcoming one here. Mona\u2019s fidgeting, which seems unusual for her, not that Dan is the best judge given that he\u2019s only known her forty-eight hours. </p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d she says eventually, seeming to navigate some internal minefield of appropriate phrasing. \u201cI know we\u2019ve only just met, but there\u2019s something I need to ask of you.\u201d </p><p>Dan nods slowly, aware that Louise is watching him, though she\u2019s trying very hard to pretend she\u2019s focused solely on the bread. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says warily. </p><p>\u201cI understand it\u2019s a bit early to ask you to commit, but\u2026 do you think you\u2019d be interested in permanently accepting this job?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 yes,\u201d Dan says. Briefly, he thinks of his final discussion with his father, the gist of which had been <i>\u2018if you do something as stupid and reckless as pissing off to waste your time up the top of a snowy hill, I\u2019ll disown you\u2019</i>. Even that lovely parting sentiment hadn\u2019t managed to dissuade Dan from coming here though, so he supposes he must really be serious about his decision to do this. \u201cI\u2019m not going to back out, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d </p><p>Mona casts a brief, relieved look in Louise\u2019s direction, which is happily returned. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s very good to hear, Dan. Okay then,\u201d she says, placing her cup of coffee down carefully in order to clasp her hands together at her waist. \u201cWhat I need to ask you, in that case, is for your total discretion. I need your word, unwaveringly, to keep quiet about a certain matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about Mr Novocaine?\u201d </p><p>Louise\u2019s bark of laughter is shrill and high. \u201cAt last! I have someone on my level of comedic talent to witticise with. It\u2019s been an arduous few years attempting to engage Mo in banter. No offense.\u201d </p><p>Rolling her eyes a bit, Mona corrects Dan, \u201cMr <i>Novokoric</i>. And yes, it\u2019s about him. I\u2019m assuming, from your reaction earlier this morning, that you don\u2019t recognise him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr\u2026 no.\u201d </p><p>Mona clears her throat, nodding. \u201cAnd have you ever heard of Sir Nikolai Novokoric of Swtizerland?\u201d</p><p>Some distant bell rings in the back of Dan\u2019s mind. He tries to dredge up the memory that accompanies it, wrinkling his nose. \u201cIs he that party-Prince that\u2019s always in all the papers? The heir of some nobleman\u2019s fortune or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a Prince, but he is connected to the Swiss monarchy,\u201d Mona replies carefully. \u201cAnd yes, his exploits are often splashed across international entertainment news.\u201d</p><p>Not being the sort of person to indulge in celebrity gossip, Dan has only a vague sense of Sir Nikolai, but his general impression of the man is that he\u2019s a spoiled, disgustingly rich little brat, squandering his inherited fortune on hundred-thousand euro bottles of champagne to fuel his obscene sex parties in exotic locations. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really follow him,\u201d Dan says with a shrug. He\u2019s already bored just thinking about the vapid excuse for a man. He sees no reason why he should be under discussion, aside from the fact he\u2019s apparently Swiss, and they\u2019re currently atop a Swiss mountain. \u201cWhy\u2019d you bring him up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou may or may not be aware that Sir Nikolai\u2019s most recent scandal was to come out as publicly bisexual,\u201d Mona says, checking her watch and speeding up the tempo of her explanation. \u201cAnd when the scandal of this statement proved to be virtually non-existent-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwitzerland\u2019s rather blas\u00e9 about that sort of thing,\u201d Louise butts in, cheerily. \u201cSexualities and whatnot. People just sort of get on with it, round here. Doesn\u2019t matter whose pants you\u2019ve got your hand down.\u201d </p><p>\u201c-he <i>then</i> decided,\u201d Mona continues, aiming a sharp look at Louise, \u201cto hype up the scandal by eloping with a male student he met during a brief stint at a British university.\u201d </p><p>Mona\u2019s expression is carefully neutral, but from her rigid stance and the way her lips purse around the words, it\u2019s more than clear what she thinks of this impulsive, erratic behaviour. </p><p>\u201cElope?\u201d Dan asks, mildly intrigued. He\u2019d been under the impression that this rich playboy was a renowned perpetual-bachelor. \u201cSo he\u2019s married now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Dan,\u201d Louise says with a tinkling laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t know how you could\u2019ve missed it! When the media found out he\u2019d run off and wedded some nobody from Manchester they had a field day! Even I heard about it, all the way up here, where the newspapers are only delivered once a week, and that\u2019s if Kaspar even remembers to bring them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Dan says uncomfortably. \u201cI don\u2019t really follow that stuff.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, now might be the time to catch yourself up to speed,\u201d Mona says, one eyebrow raised as she surveys him, unimpressed. \u201cAs the gentleman you just attempted to accost in our lobby is Sir Nikolai\u2019s recent groom, and therefore a distant member of the Royal family.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face pales, and he places the empty bowl in his hands down, feeling suddenly nauseous. \u201cHe\u2026<i> that guy</i>?\u201d </p><p>Louise laughs, radiant and bright, bouncing off the chrome surfaces of the kitchen. Dan tries to wrap his head around the new information, feeling de-stabled. He supposes that he understands the physical appeal of the man he met just now, but surely even Sir Nikolai would be put off by the resting bitch-face, or the general rudeness. Dan expects that young men like Sir Nikolai are used to having people fawn over them; he can\u2019t imagine Mr NovaScotia-or-whatever doing anything akin to fawning. </p><p>When Dan focuses back on Mona, she\u2019s fighting an amused smile. \u201cMr Novokoric is actually quite sweet, I\u2019ve found. But he does have a rather\u2026 spiky set of barriers up, until you get to know him.\u201d</p><p>Dan snorts quietly, thinking privately that he would have phrased it a little differently. Possibly he would have adopted Louise\u2019s imaginative term \u2018dick-brain\u2019. In no circumstance can Dan ever imagine being as rude to customer service staff as that man had been to him earlier. Having worked in retail and hospitality all his life, Dan is painfully aware of how shit it is to deal with irate customers; he feels that working those jobs at least once should be a rite of passage for anyone to go through, so that they can learn how to be decent human beings. He\u2019d bet that Mr Nobby-ski-head has never set foot on the other side of the till. Like his husband, he\u2019s probably an elitist twat, privately educated and living off his parents\u2019 money. </p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Dan mutters. \u201cYou said he was a permanent guest?\u201d </p><p>Mona nods, glancing at her watch; they\u2019ve been discussing this for too long for her liking, evidently. \u201cMore or less, yes. Our only suite is permanently rented out under Sir Nikolai\u2019s name, but his husband is the one who lives there most of the time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he have a mansion somewhere to lounge around in?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the ins and outs of it, Dan,\u201d Mona says, impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly my place to pry into such matters. All I know is that he\u2019s married to a Royal, and for whatever reason, he spends most of his days alone here, either in the suite on the top floor, or out on the slopes somewhere.\u201d </p><p>He nods, feeling strangely guilty for his probing question. He has no idea why he\u2019s interested at all, really. What\u2019s interesting about a severe, cold dick-brain with a superiority complex and no manners? Sure, he\u2019s\u2026 striking to behold, but that doesn\u2019t make him worthy of dwelling upon. </p><p>He\u2019s about to say something dismissive to this effect, but then he notices that Mona is already heading for the door. He grabs his bowl, about to speedily wash it up in the sink, but Louise snatches it from him and makes a shooing motion, then winks at him. He grins, grateful, and chucks the remains of his coffee down his throat before following Mona out of the kitchen. </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three!</a>)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most. </i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a></p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p>After Dan and Mona have served breakfast to the two - yes, just two - couples staying at the hotel, they clear everything away, leaving the tablecloths out for the lunch service in a few hours. As they are pretty much cut off from civilisation up here, guests are served three meals a day, along with optional extra nibbles sent to their rooms upon request. It takes Dan a full day of quietly observing, but he eventually comes to understand that The Secret of the Alps is not a place people come for adventure, or entertainment.<br /></p><p>The hotel is instead a serene, atmospheric getaway, isolated high up in the scenic Swiss Alps, away from the stresses of civilisation. People come here not for planned activities, but to spend time alone, or with each other, reading books by the fire, playing scrabble, or taking the occasional guided walk around the safe paths of the mountain. These walks are led by Kaspar, who can be called up a day in advance. There&rsquo;s a jacuzzi and sauna outside at the back of the hotel for guests to enjoy, a small gym, and a lounge stocked with a wide range of books and board games as Dan has seen. Louise is available for cooking classes if guests are interested, and each night Mona puts on a film for the guests in the mezzanine area; Louise makes buttery popcorn and Bailey&rsquo;s hot chocolate for everyone, and if people are feeling social, sometimes they loiter there well into the night, chatting. </p><p>It&rsquo;s probably not what Dan would choose for a holiday, but he understands the appeal. If you were some corporate lawyer-type drowning in fast-paced city life, it would be tempting to come somewhere remote and distant, where the WiFi is shocking enough that nobody can really contact you. </p><p>&ldquo;So, for this week, I&rsquo;m just going to have you follow me around, like you have been today,&rdquo; Mona explains to Dan in a hushed voice. His shift is almost over, and the evening film is just starting for the guests. She and Dan are at the back of the mezzanine lounge, stood next to the serving hatch, through which Louise is leaning, chin in her hand as she watches the opening credits roll. &ldquo;That way you&rsquo;ll get used to the routine.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; Dan says.&nbsp;</p><p>He met Louise earlier, as he brought through the dirty plates after dinner, and though their exchange was only brief, he feels that she&rsquo;s the type of dry, sarcastic person he could eventually be friends with.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You say that, but Mona&rsquo;s a tyrant,&rdquo; Louise mutters, and Mona shoots her a stern look. &ldquo;If you need a break from the whip-cracking, come find me. I&rsquo;ll keep you caffeinated, it&rsquo;ll make the week go faster.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Anyway,</i>&rdquo; Mona says pointedly, &ldquo;things don&rsquo;t differ much day-to-day here, as you&rsquo;ll come to learn.&rdquo; Louise makes a grunting sound of assent. &ldquo;By the end of the week, I reckon you&rsquo;ll have the routine down, and then we can start giving you some more independence. Manning reception on your own, that kind of thing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Dan says, stifling a yawn. &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think Dan might be about to fall asleep on his feet,&rdquo; Louise says amusedly, making Dan straighten up. </p><p>&ldquo;N-no, I&rsquo;m awake,&rdquo; he says hurriedly. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m just not used to the long days yet, and it&rsquo;s dark in here-&rdquo;</p><p>Mona laughs, then pats him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, Dan. This job can be boring and somehow exhausting at once. You can call it a night, I&rsquo;ll see you bright and early.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan smiles at her gratefully, then yelps as Louise reaches out and pinches his arm. Two of the guests watching the movie turn around at the high-pitched squeal, making Louise giggle. </p><p>&ldquo;Night, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night,&rdquo; he says, and then scurries towards the stairs. </p><p>By the time he gets to the top floor his knees are about to give way; he pauses in the hallway, digging in his pocket for his room key, more than ready for this day to be over. It hasn&rsquo;t been <i>awful</i>, just long and strenuous. As he pulls out the key, he notices a sliver of yellow light beneath the door of room eight, the one beside his. For a long moment, Dan stares at this light, his overtired brain struggling to work out what it could mean. Mona mentioned that she sleeps on the ground floor, in a room attached to the office. Louise and all of the other guests are still downstairs watching the film, so it can&rsquo;t be any of them, unless one of them inexplicably left their light on. </p><p>Too tired to consider this further, Dan lets himself into his own room, deciding he&rsquo;ll just ask Mona about it tomorrow. Once again, he barely makes it to the bed - though this time he does manage to pull on pyjamas - before curling up in the thick covers and letting the tears fall. </p><p>He&rsquo;s well into becoming a gross mess - nose running heavily, eyes piggy and sore - when he hears something odd enough to make him pause. A waft of soft, calming notes, shaping a sweet melody, filtering into his room through the wall behind his bed. He sits up against the pillows, ears straining, his face damp. He&rsquo;s so puzzled by the music that he forgets why he&rsquo;s crying, and just listens. In the stillness of the night, the music is the sole sound, worming its way beneath Dan&rsquo;s skin, and settling into his weary bones. </p><p>He has just enough wakefulness left in his brain to wonder how classical music could be playing at a range close enough for him to hear right now, considering everyone else is supposedly downstairs watching <i>Ocean&rsquo;s Eleven</i>. Before he can think of any answer, however, he is slipping down into the mattress, and then right through it, until he&rsquo;s floating into a sea of dream. </p><p>*</p><p>It&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and Dan&rsquo;s second day is winding down. He is at the front desk, which he&rsquo;s beginning to recognise as his base camp for the times of day when he&rsquo;s without pressing tasks - which is often. Mona&rsquo;s base camp is the office behind the reception desk, where she does scary managerial business like handling the accounts and speaking to investors.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment Mona is upstairs in the kitchen, asking Louise to make she and Dan something to eat, as the dinner rush is over now. Just as Dan is about to give in and dig in his pocket for his phone to alleviate the boredom, he hears the back door that leads to the jacuzzi and sauna opening. The door is around the corner from the reception desk, hidden from Dan&rsquo;s view, but he straightens in his seat nonetheless, preparing to make polite small talk with one of the guests. </p><p>To his total astonishment, a man walks into the lobby that he has never seen before. He&rsquo;s wearing one of the robes left for guests in each room, as well as the complimentary slippers. The robe is loosely tied around his waist, as if it might undo itself any moment, and reveal the long, toned, naked body beneath. His black hair is wet, dripping to his shoulders. As he passes the desk, he aims a vague smile at what he clearly assumes will be Mona, as when he sees Dan sat there, he does a double take. </p><p>Fixed in place by two inhumanly blue eyes, Dan cannot find a single word to utter. This man is an apparition, serene and impossible. How is he here? Dan has met all of the guests and staff. Mona would surely have told him if there were anyone else by this point. They are up the side of a mountain, with no means of being reached save for a private plane or a death-defying cable car ride, so he can&rsquo;t be an intruder, yet Dan cannot think of another explanation. He thinks of shouting for Mona, but still he cannot summon his voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; the man says, half-mumbled. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t stop walking, so Dan has no chance to respond even if he could, and then the man is climbing the stairs to the mezzanine, and disappearing out of sight. Ten minutes later, when Mona reappears, Dan explains to her what just happened in a rush, the words spilling out as if whatever had stoppered them up before has been violently uncorked at her reappearance. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Mona says, clearing her throat. She hands him a bowl of what looks like chilli, with a slice of crusty bread. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mr Novokoric,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our&hellip; special guest. Don&rsquo;t concern yourself with him right now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a guest?&rdquo; </p><p>Mona hesitates. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t come for breakfast,&rdquo; Dan points out, bewildered. &ldquo;Or lunch, or dinner.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Novokoric has his meals in his room,&rdquo; Mona says briskly, fidgeting with obvious discomfort. &ldquo;When he eats at all, that is,&rdquo; she mutters, lower. &ldquo;I will explain about all that later, Dan,&rdquo; she promises. &ldquo;For now, let&rsquo;s just focus on the main aspects of the job, getting your routine in place&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>She rambles on about the responsibilities he&rsquo;s still getting to terms with, and he half-listens, unable to stop the hundreds of questions about this mysterious &lsquo;other&rsquo; guest from swooshing around in his mind. With a lot of effort, and mostly because he feels his and Mona&rsquo;s professional relationship is still in its infancy, he swallows his curiosity down with a spoonful of piping hot chilli. </p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Dan&rsquo;s third working at The Secret of the Alps, he is up even earlier than usual. He&rsquo;d gotten more sleep than his previous two nights, thanks to the music that again drifted through the wall to staunch his free-flowing tears.&nbsp;</p><p>The light filtering through the window is still too startling to ignore however, so he abandons any attempt at staying in bed, and dresses quickly, hoping to impress Mona with his work ethic by getting an extra early start. Sure enough, he&rsquo;s the first one to reach the front desk, though he can hear Mona in her room at the back of the office shuffling around - perhaps gluing her unmoving bun in position with industrial strength adhesive. Whatever she&rsquo;s up to, Dan knows he doesn&rsquo;t have long before she emerges, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, so he sets himself up at the desk and attempts to look productive. As he skims through the hotel brochure, scanning photos of happy families in bobble-hats, and wine-flushed couples in front of log fires, his mind wanders back down the mountain, to his old life - his real life - which lurks menacingly below him, claws outstretched, ready to snatch him back the moment he peeks over the precipice. </p><p>He hears vague footsteps on the stairs, and assumes it must be Louise, as she&rsquo;s the only other person he could conceive might be up this early. He and Louise have struck up an instant colloquial rapport which he&rsquo;s grateful for, even in the few days he&rsquo;s been here, so Dan says, without looking up, &ldquo;unngh, need caffeine, Lou. I&rsquo;ll tip my head back and you just pour the coffee down my throat, kay?&rdquo; </p><p>He expects, of course, one of Louise&rsquo;s snarky yet fond comebacks, probably focused on how inadvertently sexual that request sounded. He waits for the cut of her steel tongue, but it doesn&rsquo;t come. &nbsp;Dan looks up, and meets the two vibrant blue eyes he remembers from yesterday evening, over which two dark eyebrows are arched high on a pale, exposed forehead. At once, Dan flushes, shutting the brochure with a slap, and sitting up straighter in his chair. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God, sorry, I thought you were someone else. Um, good morning-&rdquo; Dan struggles to recall the name Mona had given this man last night - Novak? Novorak? He&rsquo;s not sure. &ldquo;&hellip;Sir.&rdquo; Best to be on the safe side. &ldquo;Is there anything I can help you with?&rdquo; </p><p>The blue-eyed man doesn&rsquo;t pause, crossing the lobby towards the door, but he does shake his head slightly in response to Dan&rsquo;s question. He&rsquo;s a startling thing to behold so early in the morning. His shock of onyx hair contrasts against the scarlet snow-jacket he&rsquo;s wearing. It takes Dan a moment for his eyes to adjust to the sheer vibrancy of him, and an even longer moment to realise that tucked beneath his arm are two cherry-red skis. </p><p><i>Skiing and snowboarding is not a good idea up here</i>, Mona&rsquo;s voice echoes in his head. <i>The mountain is treacherous and unpredictable, so stress that to guests&hellip;</i></p><p>Dan jumps to his feet at once, heart already in his throat as he watches the man nearing the front door, apparently about to walk outside and strap those skis to his feet, then most likely hurl himself to his untimely death. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, S-Sir, hold on,&rdquo; Dan calls out, jogging out from the desk and over towards the man, who has turned to him with such an expression of astonishment that it&rsquo;s as if Dan had begun to perform a striptease right in the middle of the lobby. &ldquo;S-sorry,&rdquo; Dan says, stepping towards him more cautiously now, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re not allowed to ski here.&rdquo; </p><p>One of those dark eyebrows arches upwards again. &ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; not permitted for guests to ski,&rdquo; Dan says hurriedly; he can feel a steady blossoming of burst capillaries in either cheek. &ldquo;The mountain is, um,&rdquo; what did Mona say? &ldquo;&hellip;treacherous. You could be hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>A long moment passes, during which time Dan begins to wonder if maybe he should repeat himself, slower, as perhaps this man doesn&rsquo;t understand English very well. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; the man asks eventually, in the sort of voice Dan recognises from all the times he&rsquo;s dealt with petulant, &lsquo;I-want-to-speak-to-the-manager&rsquo; type middle-aged women in the retail jobs he&rsquo;s worked. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he replies, swallowing. </p><p>&ldquo;I assume you&rsquo;re the new concierge, Dan?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; yes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; The man hitches his skis up into the crook of his arm. &ldquo;I suggest that next time you decide you have any right to come up and reprimand me, that you consult with your boss before making a fool of yourself.&rdquo; </p><p>He says this in such a calm monotone that it takes Dan a few seconds to realise how rudely he&rsquo;s just been spoken to. He blushes again, absurdly. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m really very sorry, Sir, but I can&rsquo;t allow you to leave the hotel with those skis.&rdquo;</p><p>The man fixes him with a glare that would put the Real Housewives to shame. &ldquo;And what is it that you&rsquo;re going to do to stop me, Dan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; I&rsquo;ll, um-&rdquo; </p><p>Dan is saved from finishing this sentence by the sound of Mona&rsquo;s kitten heels tapping hurriedly across the wooden floor. As she gets closer, Dan can hear that she is muttering &ldquo;oh, dear god&rdquo; repeatedly under her breath. Relieved that he is no longer on his own in this situation, Dan takes a subtle step backwards from the hostile guest. He averts his gaze from those hard, cold blue eyes as he waits for Mona to assert her prim, managerial dominance over this man, and confiscate his forbidden sports equipment. </p><p>&ldquo;I am <i>so</i> sorry Mr Novokoric,&rdquo; she blurts, much to Dan&rsquo;s horror. &ldquo;Please forgive Dan, he only arrived yesterday and isn&rsquo;t yet aware of your special circumstances.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr Novokoric huffs an impatient sigh, but nods tightly. &ldquo;Might I recommend offering treats to help him learn faster.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Very funny, Mr Novokoric,&rdquo; Mona says with a polite, false-sounding laugh. Dan&rsquo;s cheeks are now rivalling the man&rsquo;s jacket, he&rsquo;s certain. Surely he can&rsquo;t have just implied Dan were a <i>dog</i>, and Mona is simply <i>laughing</i>. To Dan&rsquo;s abject bafflement, she then seems to actually give a small bow of her head. Where is his stern, no-nonsense, manageress in shining armour? This is not the same woman he recognises from the last two days. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have Dan up to speed in no time. This won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; </p><p>Mr Novokoric nods again, sliding a final, disapproving look towards Dan for good measure before muttering something like &lsquo;alright then&rsquo;, and slipping out of the door. As soon as Dan is relatively sure the man is out of earshot, he turns to Mona, scandalised. </p><p>&ldquo;Please explain to me what just happened,&rdquo; he says, as calmly as he can manage given that he is utterly seething. &ldquo;Did I do something wrong?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mona says, then considers this. &ldquo;Well, yes, but you weren&rsquo;t to know. It&rsquo;s my fault, I was trying to ease you in, but I should have discussed Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s special case sooner. I apologise for that. I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have the chance to speak to him without me being there.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan waits for her to continue, but she simply turns away, strolling determinedly back towards the desk, and nimbly side-stepping the entire issue. &ldquo;Well, I would appreciate being filled in now,&rdquo; Dan says, hot on her heels. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy being on the receiving end of one of Mr Nobby-whatsit&rsquo;s glacial stares again any time soon.&rdquo; </p><p>Mona sighs, smoothing down the non-existent stray hairs from her high bun. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she says after a moment of deliberation. She gestures for him to follow her, and moves towards the stairs up to the mezzanine. &ldquo;Come up and have some breakfast. We can discuss it - briefly - as we eat.&rdquo; </p><p>For some reason, Dan&rsquo;s heart is fluttering in his chest. He tries to imagine what possible secrets are about to be revealed to him surrounding this mysterious, moody ski-enthusiast. Perhaps Mr Novo-whatever is some sort of secret agent, using his skis to swoop from mission to mission. Or perhaps he&rsquo;s a mentally-unstable ex-patient of some nearby facility that could no longer afford to keep him due to his hostile nature. </p><p>He&rsquo;s so caught up in these various possibilities that he doesn&rsquo;t realise he&rsquo;s followed Mona into the kitchen until Louise is pushing a bowl of porridge into his hands. The letter &lsquo;D&rsquo; is drizzled on top in syrup, and there are blueberries scattered across the surface. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, wow,&rdquo; he says, chuffed. He aims a grateful smile at Louise. &ldquo;D for Dan?&rdquo;</p><p>She cocks her head to one side, frowning. &ldquo;Huh. Didn&rsquo;t think of that. I was going for Dick-brain.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan snorts, but digs straight in; it&rsquo;s thick, warm and sweet. &ldquo;Orgasmic as usual, Lou. Got any coffee to go with it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s blueberry, honey and cinnamon,&rdquo; Louise tells him enthusiastically, her front two gap-teeth bared. She&rsquo;s already at the coffee machine, turning vials and spurting steam without needing to look at what she&rsquo;s doing. &ldquo;Is it the best porridge you&rsquo;ve ever had?&rdquo;</p><p>He considers this for a moment, then bites down on a blueberry, which bursts out a tangy, tart flavour that mixes so deliciously with the sweet syrup, that Dan actually moans. &ldquo;Oh, hands down.&rdquo; </p><p>Pleased with this response, Louise makes his coffee double strength, which Dan notices, and hopes Mona doesn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;I like this one, Mo,&rdquo; Louise calls over the hissing of steam as she makes Mona a cappuccino. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go scaring him off like you did the last one.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan wonders if the failure and possible trauma of his predecessor should alarm him, but finds that he&rsquo;s too busy enjoying the blissful experience of Louise&rsquo;s porridge to really care. Besides, he&rsquo;s already here now, has already given up his life back in England to do this; it&rsquo;s going to have to be something really stupendously terrifying to chase him back to the ruins of what he left behind. </p><p>&ldquo;I did not scare that little nitwit off,&rdquo; Mona says sniffily. &ldquo;She was far too sensitive. I only told her she couldn&rsquo;t fold a towel to save her life. Which is not true of Dan, so it&rsquo;s all fine.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah yeah,&rdquo; Louise says, pouring foam. She walks over and hands the cappuccino to Mona, giving her a look. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t hurl him into the deep end without a life raft.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well I <i>was</i> trying to ease him in,&rdquo; Mona says with a heavy sigh. She blows on the coffee, then plucks a teaspoon from nearby and scoops some froth into her mouth. &ldquo;But I took my eye off him for two seconds and he went squaring up to the beast.&rdquo; </p><p>Louise makes a face halfway between a grimace and a grin, turning to Dan. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;ve met His Lordship, then?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan snorts into his near-empty bowl. &ldquo;Is that what you call him? He does act as if he&rsquo;s Royalty.&rdquo; Mona and Louise exchange a look so loaded with unspoken <i>somethings</i> that Dan actually pauses, spoon of porridge halfway to his mouth. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Louise chuckles, seemingly to herself, and turns to uncover what looks like a delicious homemade loaf of bread, which she immediately begins sawing into thick slices for the guest breakfast. Dan turns to Mona, sensing that Louise is not going to be the forthcoming one here. Mona&rsquo;s fidgeting, which seems unusual for her, not that Dan is the best judge given that he&rsquo;s only known her forty-eight hours. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; she says eventually, seeming to navigate some internal minefield of appropriate phrasing. &ldquo;I know we&rsquo;ve only just met, but there&rsquo;s something I need to ask of you.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nods slowly, aware that Louise is watching him, though she&rsquo;s trying very hard to pretend she&rsquo;s focused solely on the bread. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he says warily. </p><p>&ldquo;I understand it&rsquo;s a bit early to ask you to commit, but&hellip; do you think you&rsquo;d be interested in permanently accepting this job?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; yes,&rdquo; Dan says. Briefly, he thinks of his final discussion with his father, the gist of which had been <i>&lsquo;if you do something as stupid and reckless as pissing off to waste your time up the top of a snowy hill, I&rsquo;ll disown you&rsquo;</i>. Even that lovely parting sentiment hadn&rsquo;t managed to dissuade Dan from coming here though, so he supposes he must really be serious about his decision to do this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to back out, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo; </p><p>Mona casts a brief, relieved look in Louise&rsquo;s direction, which is happily returned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. That&rsquo;s very good to hear, Dan. Okay then,&rdquo; she says, placing her cup of coffee down carefully in order to clasp her hands together at her waist. &ldquo;What I need to ask you, in that case, is for your total discretion. I need your word, unwaveringly, to keep quiet about a certain matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is this about Mr Novocaine?&rdquo; </p><p>Louise&rsquo;s bark of laughter is shrill and high. &ldquo;At last! I have someone on my level of comedic talent to witticise with. It&rsquo;s been an arduous few years attempting to engage Mo in banter. No offense.&rdquo; </p><p>Rolling her eyes a bit, Mona corrects Dan, &ldquo;Mr <i>Novokoric</i>. And yes, it&rsquo;s about him. I&rsquo;m assuming, from your reaction earlier this morning, that you don&rsquo;t recognise him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er&hellip; no.&rdquo; </p><p>Mona clears her throat, nodding. &ldquo;And have you ever heard of Sir Nikolai Novokoric of Swtizerland?&rdquo;</p><p>Some distant bell rings in the back of Dan&rsquo;s mind. He tries to dredge up the memory that accompanies it, wrinkling his nose. &ldquo;Is he that party-Prince that&rsquo;s always in all the papers? The heir of some nobleman&rsquo;s fortune or something?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a Prince, but he is connected to the Swiss monarchy,&rdquo; Mona replies carefully. &ldquo;And yes, his exploits are often splashed across international entertainment news.&rdquo;</p><p>Not being the sort of person to indulge in celebrity gossip, Dan has only a vague sense of Sir Nikolai, but his general impression of the man is that he&rsquo;s a spoiled, disgustingly rich little brat, squandering his inherited fortune on hundred-thousand euro bottles of champagne to fuel his obscene sex parties in exotic locations. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really follow him,&rdquo; Dan says with a shrug. He&rsquo;s already bored just thinking about the vapid excuse for a man. He sees no reason why he should be under discussion, aside from the fact he&rsquo;s apparently Swiss, and they&rsquo;re currently atop a Swiss mountain. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you bring him up?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You may or may not be aware that Sir Nikolai&rsquo;s most recent scandal was to come out as publicly bisexual,&rdquo; Mona says, checking her watch and speeding up the tempo of her explanation. &ldquo;And when the scandal of this statement proved to be virtually non-existent-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Switzerland&rsquo;s rather blas&eacute; about that sort of thing,&rdquo; Louise butts in, cheerily. &ldquo;Sexualities and whatnot. People just sort of get on with it, round here. Doesn&rsquo;t matter whose pants you&rsquo;ve got your hand down.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;-he <i>then</i> decided,&rdquo; Mona continues, aiming a sharp look at Louise, &ldquo;to hype up the scandal by eloping with a male student he met during a brief stint at a British university.&rdquo; </p><p>Mona&rsquo;s expression is carefully neutral, but from her rigid stance and the way her lips purse around the words, it&rsquo;s more than clear what she thinks of this impulsive, erratic behaviour. </p><p>&ldquo;Elope?&rdquo; Dan asks, mildly intrigued. He&rsquo;d been under the impression that this rich playboy was a renowned perpetual-bachelor. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s married now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, Dan,&rdquo; Louise says with a tinkling laugh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how you could&rsquo;ve missed it! When the media found out he&rsquo;d run off and wedded some nobody from Manchester they had a field day! Even I heard about it, all the way up here, where the newspapers are only delivered once a week, and that&rsquo;s if Kaspar even remembers to bring them.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like I said,&rdquo; Dan says uncomfortably. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really follow that stuff.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, now might be the time to catch yourself up to speed,&rdquo; Mona says, one eyebrow raised as she surveys him, unimpressed. &ldquo;As the gentleman you just attempted to accost in our lobby is Sir Nikolai&rsquo;s recent groom, and therefore a distant member of the Royal family.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s face pales, and he places the empty bowl in his hands down, feeling suddenly nauseous. &ldquo;He&hellip;<i> that guy</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>Louise laughs, radiant and bright, bouncing off the chrome surfaces of the kitchen. Dan tries to wrap his head around the new information, feeling de-stabled. He supposes that he understands the physical appeal of the man he met just now, but surely even Sir Nikolai would be put off by the resting bitch-face, or the general rudeness. Dan expects that young men like Sir Nikolai are used to having people fawn over them; he can&rsquo;t imagine Mr NovaScotia-or-whatever doing anything akin to fawning. </p><p>When Dan focuses back on Mona, she&rsquo;s fighting an amused smile. &ldquo;Mr Novokoric is actually quite sweet, I&rsquo;ve found. But he does have a rather&hellip; spiky set of barriers up, until you get to know him.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan snorts quietly, thinking privately that he would have phrased it a little differently. Possibly he would have adopted Louise&rsquo;s imaginative term &lsquo;dick-brain&rsquo;. In no circumstance can Dan ever imagine being as rude to customer service staff as that man had been to him earlier. Having worked in retail and hospitality all his life, Dan is painfully aware of how shit it is to deal with irate customers; he feels that working those jobs at least once should be a rite of passage for anyone to go through, so that they can learn how to be decent human beings. He&rsquo;d bet that Mr Nobby-ski-head has never set foot on the other side of the till. Like his husband, he&rsquo;s probably an elitist twat, privately educated and living off his parents&rsquo; money. </p><p>&ldquo;If you say so,&rdquo; Dan mutters. &ldquo;You said he was a permanent guest?&rdquo; </p><p>Mona nods, glancing at her watch; they&rsquo;ve been discussing this for too long for her liking, evidently. &ldquo;More or less, yes. Our only suite is permanently rented out under Sir Nikolai&rsquo;s name, but his husband is the one who lives there most of the time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he have a mansion somewhere to lounge around in?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the ins and outs of it, Dan,&rdquo; Mona says, impatiently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly my place to pry into such matters. All I know is that he&rsquo;s married to a Royal, and for whatever reason, he spends most of his days alone here, either in the suite on the top floor, or out on the slopes somewhere.&rdquo; </p><p>He nods, feeling strangely guilty for his probing question. He has no idea why he&rsquo;s interested at all, really. What&rsquo;s interesting about a severe, cold dick-brain with a superiority complex and no manners? Sure, he&rsquo;s&hellip; striking to behold, but that doesn&rsquo;t make him worthy of dwelling upon. </p><p>He&rsquo;s about to say something dismissive to this effect, but then he notices that Mona is already heading for the door. He grabs his bowl, about to speedily wash it up in the sink, but Louise snatches it from him and makes a shooing motion, then winks at him. He grins, grateful, and chucks the remains of his coffee down his throat before following Mona out of the kitchen. </p><p><b>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three!</a>)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most. </i></p>\n<p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a></p>\n<p><b>Chapter Two</b></p>\n<p>After Dan and Mona have served breakfast to the two - yes, just two - couples staying at the hotel, they clear everything away, leaving the tablecloths out for the lunch service in a few hours. As they are pretty much cut off from civilisation up here, guests are served three meals a day, along with optional extra nibbles sent to their rooms upon request. It takes Dan a full day of quietly observing, but he eventually comes to understand that The Secret of the Alps is not a place people come for adventure, or entertainment.<br /></p>\n<p>The hotel is instead a serene, atmospheric getaway, isolated high up in the scenic Swiss Alps, away from the stresses of civilisation. People come here not for planned activities, but to spend time alone, or with each other, reading books by the fire, playing scrabble, or taking the occasional guided walk around the safe paths of the mountain. These walks are led by Kaspar, who can be called up a day in advance. There&rsquo;s a jacuzzi and sauna outside at the back of the hotel for guests to enjoy, a small gym, and a lounge stocked with a wide range of books and board games as Dan has seen. Louise is available for cooking classes if guests are interested, and each night Mona puts on a film for the guests in the mezzanine area; Louise makes buttery popcorn and Bailey&rsquo;s hot chocolate for everyone, and if people are feeling social, sometimes they loiter there well into the night, chatting. </p>\n</p>",
