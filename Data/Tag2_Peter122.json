        "answer": "<p>Well the guy at the post credits scene was Miguel O\u2019Hara AKA Spider-man 2099. Given how fleshed out and unique his universe is, as well as his personality compared to everyone else. I would totally expect him to join the mini spider army that\u2019s being made.</p><p>But then we look at the last scenes of Spiderverse as a whole. Miles and Gwen are able to communicate across dimensions and Miguel is clearly trying to stop an different interdimensional crisis from happening. So first we need to ask, what could Miguel be trying to stop?</p><p>Well the obvious answer would be the villains of the original Spiderverse comic, the Inheritors <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"220\" data-orig-height=\"330\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f713c1adbf26baf14da23398a6ffe379/tumblr_inline_pnjywgvFeC1tnes7u_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"220\" data-orig-height=\"330\"/></figure><p>To put it simply, they\u2019re vampires who feed on animal and human totems and were prophesied that a spider-totem would overthrow them. They were the big bads of Spiderverse the comic and its sequel spidergeddon. So it would not be too surprising if they decide to follow\u00a0 that for the movie. Maybe make them less goofy and more interesting maybe.</p><p>With Miles possibly going to hang out with Gwen or Gwen going to hang out with him, it is possible that it will attract multiple Inheritors to their universe.

The group of friends picked a table nearest to the large windows, wanting to feel that good spring warmth on their skin. Everyone seemed to be relaxed, talking about their previous day, and making plans for today. Peter only half listened to the conversation. His eyes kept drifting off to wherever y/n was, checking up on her to see if she was doing alright after he had calmed her down earlier. She seemed to be doing better, keeping a gentle smile on her face as she gathered the leftover dishes from empty tables. She was avoiding Flash\u2019s side of the room, and at some point even went as far as asking one of her coworkers to take care of it.</p><p>Ned nudged his leg underneath the table, bringing Peter back to reality. He looked over at him, and Ned jutted his chin in MJ\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cSorry Em, what were you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asking if you wanted to help me with a piece I\u2019m doing. I want to go to the city\u2019s main square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for your portfolio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t be more than a few hours at the most. I already asked these two but the lovers already have a date planned for their afternoon.\u201d MJ wrinkled her nose playfully towards Ned and Beth as she says the last part, earning a \u2018hey!\u2019 from Beth, who playfully hits her with her napkin. Peter hesitates as he looks over in the direction he had last seen y/n, which was near the kitchen entrance.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not. Just let me know what time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter brunch? I need to gather my things but I\u2019ll meet you by the front fountain.\u201d</p><p>Once the plans were set, the group continues on with brunch. Y/N swoops by gracefully, gathering the empty plates from their table before heading straight to the kitchen. Beth and Ned get up to go get ready for their date, and MJ goes to gather her art things for the afternoon. Peter looks around the room, making sure Flash wasn\u2019t around before making his way to the kitchen entrance.</p><p>The sound of the dishes being washed in soap and sanitizer got louder the closer Peter got. There were quick italian words being exchanged between the employees, mostly male, and some laughter here and there. Y/N catches sight of the boy and smiles as she makes her way towards him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Buongiorno solare/Good morning, sunshine.</i>\u201d y/n leans in to peck both of Peter\u2019s cheeks, leaving him a rosy cheeked mess.</p><p>\u201cBuongiorno principessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Hai qualche piano con i tuoi amici/Do you have plans with your friends?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cSto aiutando un'amica con la sua arte oggi. E tu/I\u2019m helping a friend with her art today. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Only work. I hope you have fun, my Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see you later? When I get back?\u201d</p><p>Y/N shakes her head and gives him an apologetic smile. \u201c<i>Devo finire i compiti prima di domani. Ma forse domani pomeriggio?/I have homework to finish before tomorrow. But maybe tomorrow afternoon?</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a sigh and nods. \u201cIt\u2019s a date then.\u201d he says, causing her to smile.</p><!-- more --><p>After receiving a text from MJ saying she was on her way down, the two exchange a quick goodbye before going to their respective destinations; y/n back to work and Peter to the fountain in front of the hotel.</p><p>The ride into the city was gorgeous. The scenery was so green and alive, the sky was a bright blue, and there wasn\u2019t a single cloud in the sky. Peter sat next to MJ silently, who was busy sketching something out in her journal. She was in her own world, leaving Peter to busy himself on his own. His mind wandered back to y/n. It had been a week and a half since they\u2019d been keeping their little secret to themselves. That meant they only had three more weeks together, but in retrospect that was very little time. Being busy with his daytime schooling activities and class dinners meant less time with y/n as well. Aside from this, Peter couldn\u2019t help but feel warm for the girl, as if he had known her his entire life. There was no awkward beginning phase between the two of them. The two just\u2026 clicked. This made everything happen so much easier. Truly the only bump in the road had been Flash. He was\u2026 something.</p><p>MJ and Peter unboard at the city station and discuss where to go. They made a plan to go to the park first, then end their outing at a cafe nearby before they\u2019d go back to the hotel. With the sun out, this meant a busier park, which was perfect for MJ. She was doing a realism piece, and she had an idea in her mind on what she wanted that to look like. Her plan was to sketch something out in an indoor location and outdoor location, emphasizing the way the surroundings seemed to encourage people\u2019s behavior. It wasn\u2019t too long before MJ\u2019s chatter died down to silence as she began concentrating once more.</p><p>Peter spent most of his time at the park people watching, from the lone elderly man walking his chihuahua to the young couple watching their toddler run through the grass to chase the birds. The sunshine was putting everyone in a good mood. Eventually after growing bored of his phone and watching people, Peter lays back on the grass and looks up at the cloudless sky. He ends up napping, arms crossed behind his head as the sun kissed his skin. Although he was simply here to keep MJ company, Peter felt relaxed in his own head. The only indication that there was someone there with him was the quick scratching of pencil and paper beside him, and the occasional seated shifting.</p><p>After the two friends\u2019 day ends with a two hour stay at a nearby cafe, they make their way back to the hotel for dinner. They were meeting Ned and Beth near the Venetian walls first to help them with pictures to commemorate the trip, then together the four of them would head to the hotel, where they were hoping to snag a table outside in the green to watch the sunset as they ate. All in all, their Sunday evening would have a pretty uneventful ending.</p><p>\u201cI am starving.\u201d Ned groans as he plops onto his bed after a long day out with their class. They had taken the train to another city that was an hour ride away, and there they had a full day cooking class. The class consisted of a lecture on the history of Italian cuisine, some sampling, as well as a walking tour of the michelin star restaurant they were at. Tomorrow would be when they would dip into some food and cook something themselves.</p><p>Peter throws his backpack next to his head and yawns, looking at the time on his watch. They had about half an hour before dinner, which meant he would need to figure out a way to discreetly leave with y/n before then. His friends would know immediately if he was gone; they would obviously notice him not present during dinner. And although Ned somewhat knew the situation, he didn\u2019t necessarily want to tell him what was going on.</p><p>Peter paced back and forth nervously, running a hand through his hair as he kept glancing at the time. Ned eyes his friend for a moment before saying anything.</p><p>\u201cDude, are you okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d Peter blurts out. He covers his mouth with his hand, blushing. Ned furrows his brows and sits up.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m going on a date with y/n, you know the girl who works here? And I just need to make it not look suspicious.\u201d Peter tells his friend.</p><p>\u201cI can just say you have a stomach ache so you\u2019re not hungry.\u201d Ned shrugs at the boy. Peter\u2019s shoulders drop when he realizes that the solution to his dilemma was truly that easy. He wasn\u2019t sure why he had been overthinking it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ned says, waggling his eyebrows. \u201cwhere are you guys going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner. I googled this restaurant where they serve you dinner under the stars and they have those twinkling lights on trees and stuff and I thought she might like it.\u201d</p><p>Ned gives Peter an approving nod. The two chat for a bit more, then Peter changes into a dress shirt and some slacks. He checks his hair in the mirror for the last time that day, then heads out to pick up y/n at her house. He roughly remembered where she lived, except the difference now was that he was walking there during daylight hours. There were people still out and about, and the town wasn\u2019t dead yet.</p><p>Peter knocks on the front door and an older woman answers. She has the same kind eyes that y/n has, except she looks a bit more aged. The woman\u2019s graying black hair is cut in a blunt bob, which shaped her face nicely.</p><p>\u201cCiao, sono qui per y/n/Hi, I\u2019m here for y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, vieni vieni, non c'\u00e8 bisogno di essere nervoso/Ah, come come, no need to be nervous.\u201d the woman smiles. She ushers Peter inside then calls out for y/n up the stairs. She disappears for a moment, before coming and offering Peter some tea or coffee, both of which Peter declines politely. It wasn\u2019t really to save space for dinner; if anything the boy was too nervous to know if he could stomach anything down.</p><p>A few moments later, y/n\u2019s footsteps down the stairway become clearer, and she steps into the living room where Peter waits for her. She\u2019s taken his breath away, that was how beautiful she looked. Y/N\u2019s hair was curled loosely around her shoulders, and she wore a deep red sundress with thin straps. Her skin was glittery from her makeup, and she had a red lipstick on as well. She looked at Peter shyly as he gawked at her.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d he finally let out. Y/N giggled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cVoi due state bene, okay/You two be safe, okay?\u201d the woman says as the two make their way out.</p><p>\u201c<i>Okay mamma.</i>\u201d</p><p>It is a silent walk to the nearby restaurant. The warm breeze bristled past the pair, past their hands that just brushed against each other as they walked. The hostess checks them in and seats them at one of the many round tables, handing them menus before leaving them alone. Soft music plays from somewhere nearby, creating a relaxing but slightly romantic atmosphere. When Peter looked up at y/n, he saw the sun setting behind her. He couldn\u2019t help but whip out his phone and snap a picture of y/n, with the sun hitting her at a great angle. The last one Peter gets is one of her looking up at him, the cutest smile playing on her lips. Satisfied, he puts his phone away.</p><p>Dinner is full of conversation. Y/N seems very interested in learning about Peter\u2019s life, so he tells her about him living with his aunt May, whom he adores. He tells her about uncle Ben and his parents, about living in New York, his internship at Stark Industries, etc. Y/N in turn tells Peter about her family, which includes her two older brothers and a baby sister on the way, as well as a cat and a dog. She tells him about her school, the friends she has there, what her dreams are. The conversation just flows and flows, and they find it hard to stop.</p><p>They decide to pop into the park they\u2019d gone to before at night, the one with the lake that reflects the moon perfectly. At this point, since it is a little chilly, Peter gives y/n the coat he\u2019d brought along, draping it over her shoulders. The walk to the park is lovely, with lush flower bushes lining the walkway. Peter stops to pluck a pink flower, tucking it behind y/n\u2019s ear. She thanks him and kisses his cheek.</p><p>Peter and y/n sit on the grass. Since it had been such a nice day, it wasn\u2019t dewy or gross. The grass was soft against Peter\u2019s palms as he leaned back, looking up at the stars. Y/N leans her head on Peter\u2019s shoulders, scooting right next to him. He wraps his arm around her, rubbing her arm comfortingly. There was no conversation in this moment. Just a calm silence between the two of them.</p><p>\u201c<i>Sai, mi piaci davvero Peter. Un sacco/You know, I really like you Peter. A lot</i>.\u201d</p><p>Y/N is looking up at him now. Her face is awfully close to Peter\u2019s, and realizing that makes Peter\u2019s heart palpitate nervously. He couldn\u2019t think of anything to say as he moved a strand of her hair away from her face. When he touched her face, y/n leaned into the palm of his hand, never breaking eye contact with the boy. Before he could overthink this, he moves in and kisses y/n. There lips meeting sends a jolt of electricity through his body, and his senses are on overdrive. He brings up his other hand to hold her face, and y/n wraps her arms loosely around his neck. Her lips taste faintly of the chocolate tarte they\u2019d shared, rich and buttery. Peter could feel her heart racing in her chest, just like his. She was nervous too.</p><p>When they finally pull away, with the moonlight shining down on their faces, they both blush and smile at each other. There wasn\u2019t anything to say; that kiss had said it all.</p><p><i>taglist below the cut</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\"

The scenery was so green and alive, the sky was a bright blue, and there wasn\u2019t a single cloud in the sky. Peter sat next to MJ silently, who was busy sketching something out in her journal. She was in her own world, leaving Peter to busy himself on his own. His mind wandered back to y/n. It had been a week and a half since they\u2019d been keeping their little secret to themselves. That meant they only had three more weeks together, but in retrospect that was very little time. Being busy with his daytime schooling activities and class dinners meant less time with y/n as well. Aside from this, Peter couldn\u2019t help but feel warm for the girl, as if he had known her his entire life. There was no awkward beginning phase between the two of them. The two just\u2026 clicked. This made everything happen so much easier. Truly the only bump in the road had been Flash. He was\u2026 something.</p><p>MJ and Peter unboard at the city station and discuss where to go. They made a plan to go to the park first, then end their outing at a cafe nearby before they\u2019d go back to the hotel. With the sun out, this meant a busier park, which was perfect for MJ. She was doing a realism piece, and she had an idea in her mind on what she wanted that to look like. Her plan was to sketch something out in an indoor location and outdoor location, emphasizing the way the surroundings seemed to encourage people\u2019s behavior. It wasn\u2019t too long before MJ\u2019s chatter died down to silence as she began concentrating once more.</p><p>Peter spent most of his time at the park people watching, from the lone elderly man walking his chihuahua to the young couple watching their toddler run through the grass to chase the birds. The sunshine was putting everyone in a good mood. Eventually after growing bored of his phone and watching people, Peter lays back on the grass and looks up at the cloudless sky. He ends up napping, arms crossed behind his head as the sun kissed his skin. Although he was simply here to keep MJ company, Peter felt relaxed in his own head. The only indication that there was someone there with him was the quick scratching of pencil and paper beside him, and the occasional seated shifting.</p><p>After the two friends\u2019 day ends with a two hour stay at a nearby cafe, they make their way back to the hotel for dinner. They were meeting Ned and Beth near the Venetian walls first to help them with pictures to commemorate the trip, then together the four of them would head to the hotel, where they were hoping to snag a table outside in the green to watch the sunset as they ate. All in all, their Sunday evening would have a pretty uneventful ending.</p><p>\u201cI am starving.\u201d Ned groans as he plops onto his bed after a long day out with their class. They had taken the train to another city that was an hour ride away, and there they had a full day cooking class. The class consisted of a lecture on the history of Italian cuisine, some sampling, as well as a walking tour of the michelin star restaurant they were at. Tomorrow would be when they would dip into some food and cook something themselves.</p><p>Peter throws his backpack next to his head and yawns, looking at the time on his watch. They had about half an hour before dinner, which meant he would need to figure out a way to discreetly leave with y/n before then. His friends would know immediately if he was gone; they would obviously notice him not present during dinner. And although Ned somewhat knew the situation, he didn\u2019t necessarily want to tell him what was going on.</p><p>Peter paced back and forth nervously, running a hand through his hair as he kept glancing at the time. Ned eyes his friend for a moment before saying anything.</p><p>\u201cDude, are you okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d Peter blurts out. He covers his mouth with his hand, blushing. Ned furrows his brows and sits up.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m going on a date with y/n, you know the girl who works here? And I just need to make it not look suspicious.\u201d Peter tells his friend.</p><p>\u201cI can just say you have a stomach ache so you\u2019re not hungry.\u201d Ned shrugs at the boy. Peter\u2019s shoulders drop when he realizes that the solution to his dilemma was truly that easy. He wasn\u2019t sure why he had been overthinking it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ned says, waggling his eyebrows. \u201cwhere are you guys going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner. I googled this restaurant where they serve you dinner under the stars and they have those twinkling lights on trees and stuff and I thought she might like it.\u201d</p><p>Ned gives Peter an approving nod. The two chat for a bit more, then Peter changes into a dress shirt and some slacks. He checks his hair in the mirror for the last time that day, then heads out to pick up y/n at her house. He roughly remembered where she lived, except the difference now was that he was walking there during daylight hours. There were people still out and about, and the town wasn\u2019t dead yet.</p><p>Peter knocks on the front door and an older woman answers. She has the same kind eyes that y/n has, except she looks a bit more aged. The woman\u2019s graying black hair is cut in a blunt bob, which shaped her face nicely.</p><p>\u201cCiao, sono qui per y/n/Hi, I\u2019m here for y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, vieni vieni, non c'\u00e8 bisogno di essere nervoso/Ah, come come, no need to be nervous.\u201d the woman smiles. She ushers Peter inside then calls out for y/n up the stairs. She disappears for a moment, before coming and offering Peter some tea or coffee, both of which Peter declines politely. It wasn\u2019t really to save space for dinner; if anything the boy was too nervous to know if he could stomach anything down.</p><p>A few moments later, y/n\u2019s footsteps down the stairway become clearer, and she steps into the living room where Peter waits for her. She\u2019s taken his breath away, that was how beautiful she looked. Y/N\u2019s hair was curled loosely around her shoulders, and she wore a deep red sundress with thin straps. Her skin was glittery from her makeup, and she had a red lipstick on as well. She looked at Peter shyly as he gawked at her.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d he finally let out. Y/N giggled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cVoi due state bene, okay/You two be safe, okay?\u201d the woman says as the two make their way out.</p><p>\u201c<i>Okay mamma.</i>\u201d</p><p>It is a silent walk to the nearby restaurant. The warm breeze bristled past the pair, past their hands that just brushed against each other as they walked. The hostess checks them in and seats them at one of the many round tables, handing them menus before leaving them alone. Soft music plays from somewhere nearby, creating a relaxing but slightly romantic atmosphere. When Peter looked up at y/n, he saw the sun setting behind her. He couldn\u2019t help but whip out his phone and snap a picture of y/n, with the sun hitting her at a great angle. The last one Peter gets is one of her looking up at him, the cutest smile playing on her lips. Satisfied, he puts his phone away.</p><p>Dinner is full of conversation. Y/N seems very interested in learning about Peter\u2019s life, so he tells her about him living with his aunt May, whom he adores. He tells her about uncle Ben and his parents, about living in New York, his internship at Stark Industries, etc. Y/N in turn tells Peter about her family, which includes her two older brothers and a baby sister on the way, as well as a cat and a dog. She tells him about her school, the friends she has there, what her dreams are. The conversation just flows and flows, and they find it hard to stop.</p><p>They decide to pop into the park they\u2019d gone to before at night, the one with the lake that reflects the moon perfectly. At this point, since it is a little chilly, Peter gives y/n the coat he\u2019d brought along, draping it over her shoulders. The walk to the park is lovely, with lush flower bushes lining the walkway. Peter stops to pluck a pink flower, tucking it behind y/n\u2019s ear. She thanks him and kisses his cheek.</p><p>Peter and y/n sit on the grass. Since it had been such a nice day, it wasn\u2019t dewy or gross. The grass was soft against Peter\u2019s palms as he leaned back, looking up at the stars. Y/N leans her head on Peter\u2019s shoulders, scooting right next to him. He wraps his arm around her, rubbing her arm comfortingly. There was no conversation in this moment. Just a calm silence between the two of them.</p><p>\u201c<i>Sai, mi piaci davvero Peter. Un sacco/You know, I really like you Peter. A lot</i>.\u201d</p><p>Y/N is looking up at him now. Her face is awfully close to Peter\u2019s, and realizing that makes Peter\u2019s heart palpitate nervously. He couldn\u2019t think of anything to say as he moved a strand of her hair away from her face. When he touched her face, y/n leaned into the palm of his hand, never breaking eye contact with the boy. Before he could overthink this, he moves in and kisses y/n. There lips meeting sends a jolt of electricity through his body, and his senses are on overdrive. He brings up his other hand to hold her face, and y/n wraps her arms loosely around his neck. Her lips taste faintly of the chocolate tarte they\u2019d shared, rich and buttery. Peter could feel her heart racing in her chest, just like his. She was nervous too.</p><p>When they finally pull away, with the moonlight shining down on their faces, they both blush and smile at each other. There wasn\u2019t anything to say; that kiss had said it all.</p><p><i>taglist below the cut</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\"

The group of friends picked a table nearest to the large windows, wanting to feel that good spring warmth on their skin. Everyone seemed to be relaxed, talking about their previous day, and making plans for today. Peter only half listened to the conversation. His eyes kept drifting off to wherever y/n was, checking up on her to see if she was doing alright after he had calmed her down earlier. She seemed to be doing better, keeping a gentle smile on her face as she gathered the leftover dishes from empty tables. She was avoiding Flash\u2019s side of the room, and at some point even went as far as asking one of her coworkers to take care of it.</p><p>Ned nudged his leg underneath the table, bringing Peter back to reality. He looked over at him, and Ned jutted his chin in MJ\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cSorry Em, what were you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asking if you wanted to help me with a piece I\u2019m doing. I want to go to the city\u2019s main square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for your portfolio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t be more than a few hours at the most. I already asked these two but the lovers already have a date planned for their afternoon.\u201d MJ wrinkled her nose playfully towards Ned and Beth as she says the last part, earning a \u2018hey!\u2019 from Beth, who playfully hits her with her napkin. Peter hesitates as he looks over in the direction he had last seen y/n, which was near the kitchen entrance.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not. Just let me know what time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter brunch? I need to gather my things but I\u2019ll meet you by the front fountain.\u201d</p><p>Once the plans were set, the group continues on with brunch. Y/N swoops by gracefully, gathering the empty plates from their table before heading straight to the kitchen. Beth and Ned get up to go get ready for their date, and MJ goes to gather her art things for the afternoon. Peter looks around the room, making sure Flash wasn\u2019t around before making his way to the kitchen entrance.</p><p>The sound of the dishes being washed in soap and sanitizer got louder the closer Peter got. There were quick italian words being exchanged between the employees, mostly male, and some laughter here and there. Y/N catches sight of the boy and smiles as she makes her way towards him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Buongiorno solare/Good morning, sunshine.</i>\u201d y/n leans in to peck both of Peter\u2019s cheeks, leaving him a rosy cheeked mess.</p><p>\u201cBuongiorno principessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Hai qualche piano con i tuoi amici/Do you have plans with your friends?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cSto aiutando un'amica con la sua arte oggi.

Ma forse domani pomeriggio?/I have homework to finish before tomorrow. But maybe tomorrow afternoon?</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter lets out a sigh and nods. \u201cIt\u2019s a date then.\u201d he says, causing her to smile.</p>[[MORE]]<p>After receiving a text from MJ saying she was on her way down, the two exchange a quick goodbye before going to their respective destinations; y/n back to work and Peter to the fountain in front of the hotel.</p><p>The ride into the city was gorgeous. The scenery was so green and alive, the sky was a bright blue, and there wasn\u2019t a single cloud in the sky. Peter sat next to MJ silently, who was busy sketching something out in her journal. She was in her own world, leaving Peter to busy himself on his own. His mind wandered back to y/n. It had been a week and a half since they\u2019d been keeping their little secret to themselves. That meant they only had three more weeks together, but in retrospect that was very little time. Being busy with his daytime schooling activities and class dinners meant less time with y/n as well. Aside from this, Peter couldn\u2019t help but feel warm for the girl, as if he had known her his entire life. There was no awkward beginning phase between the two of them. The two just\u2026 clicked. This made everything happen so much easier. Truly the only bump in the road had been Flash. He was\u2026 something.</p><p>MJ and Peter unboard at the city station and discuss where to go. They made a plan to go to the park first, then end their outing at a cafe nearby before they\u2019d go back to the hotel. With the sun out, this meant a busier park, which was perfect for MJ. She was doing a realism piece, and she had an idea in her mind on what she wanted that to look like. Her plan was to sketch something out in an indoor location and outdoor location, emphasizing the way the surroundings seemed to encourage people\u2019s behavior. It wasn\u2019t too long before MJ\u2019s chatter died down to silence as she began concentrating once more.</p><p>Peter spent most of his time at the park people watching, from the lone elderly man walking his chihuahua to the young couple watching their toddler run through the grass to chase the birds. The sunshine was putting everyone in a good mood. Eventually after growing bored of his phone and watching people, Peter lays back on the grass and looks up at the cloudless sky. He ends up napping, arms crossed behind his head as the sun kissed his skin. Although he was simply here to keep MJ company, Peter felt relaxed in his own head. The only indication that there was someone there with him was the quick scratching of pencil and paper beside him, and the occasional seated shifting.</p><p>After the two friends\u2019 day ends with a two hour stay at a nearby cafe, they make their way back to the hotel for dinner. They were meeting Ned and Beth near the Venetian walls first to help them with pictures to commemorate the trip, then together the four of them would head to the hotel, where they were hoping to snag a table outside in the green to watch the sunset as they ate. All in all, their Sunday evening would have a pretty uneventful ending.</p><p>\u201cI am starving.\u201d Ned groans as he plops onto his bed after a long day out with their class. They had taken the train to another city that was an hour ride away, and there they had a full day cooking class. The class consisted of a lecture on the history of Italian cuisine, some sampling, as well as a walking tour of the michelin star restaurant they were at. Tomorrow would be when they would dip into some food and cook something themselves.</p><p>Peter throws his backpack next to his head and yawns, looking at the time on his watch. They had about half an hour before dinner, which meant he would need to figure out a way to discreetly leave with y/n before then. His friends would know immediately if he was gone; they would obviously notice him not present during dinner. And although Ned somewhat knew the situation, he didn\u2019t necessarily want to tell him what was going on.</p><p>Peter paced back and forth nervously, running a hand through his hair as he kept glancing at the time. Ned eyes his friend for a moment before saying anything.</p><p>\u201cDude, are you okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d Peter blurts out. He covers his mouth with his hand, blushing. Ned furrows his brows and sits up.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m going on a date with y/n, you know the girl who works here? And I just need to make it not look suspicious.\u201d Peter tells his friend.</p><p>\u201cI can just say you have a stomach ache so you\u2019re not hungry.\u201d Ned shrugs at the boy. Peter\u2019s shoulders drop when he realizes that the solution to his dilemma was truly that easy. He wasn\u2019t sure why he had been overthinking it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ned says, waggling his eyebrows. \u201cwhere are you guys going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner. I googled this restaurant where they serve you dinner under the stars and they have those twinkling lights on trees and stuff and I thought she might like it.\u201d</p><p>Ned gives Peter an approving nod. The two chat for a bit more, then Peter changes into a dress shirt and some slacks. He checks his hair in the mirror for the last time that day, then heads out to pick up y/n at her house. He roughly remembered where she lived, except the difference now was that he was walking there during daylight hours. There were people still out and about, and the town wasn\u2019t dead yet.</p><p>Peter knocks on the front door and an older woman answers. She has the same kind eyes that y/n has, except she looks a bit more aged. The woman\u2019s graying black hair is cut in a blunt bob, which shaped her face nicely.</p><p>\u201cCiao, sono qui per y/n/Hi, I\u2019m here for y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, vieni vieni, non c'\u00e8 bisogno di essere nervoso/Ah, come come, no need to be nervous.\u201d the woman smiles. She ushers Peter inside then calls out for y/n up the stairs. She disappears for a moment, before coming and offering Peter some tea or coffee, both of which Peter declines politely. It wasn\u2019t really to save space for dinner; if anything the boy was too nervous to know if he could stomach anything down.</p><p>A few moments later, y/n\u2019s footsteps down the stairway become clearer, and she steps into the living room where Peter waits for her. She\u2019s taken his breath away, that was how beautiful she looked. Y/N\u2019s hair was curled loosely around her shoulders, and she wore a deep red sundress with thin straps. Her skin was glittery from her makeup, and she had a red lipstick on as well. She looked at Peter shyly as he gawked at her.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d he finally let out. Y/N giggled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cVoi due state bene, okay/You two be safe, okay?\u201d the woman says as the two make their way out.</p><p>\u201c<i>Okay mamma.</i>\u201d</p><p>It is a silent walk to the nearby restaurant. The warm breeze bristled past the pair, past their hands that just brushed against each other as they walked. The hostess checks them in and seats them at one of the many round tables, handing them menus before leaving them alone. Soft music plays from somewhere nearby, creating a relaxing but slightly romantic atmosphere. When Peter looked up at y/n, he saw the sun setting behind her. He couldn\u2019t help but whip out his phone and snap a picture of y/n, with the sun hitting her at a great angle. The last one Peter gets is one of her looking up at him, the cutest smile playing on her lips. Satisfied, he puts his phone away.</p><p>Dinner is full of conversation. Y/N seems very interested in learning about Peter\u2019s life, so he tells her about him living with his aunt May, whom he adores. He tells her about uncle Ben and his parents, about living in New York, his internship at Stark Industries, etc. Y/N in turn tells Peter about her family, which includes her two older brothers and a baby sister on the way, as well as a cat and a dog. She tells him about her school, the friends she has there, what her dreams are. The conversation just flows and flows, and they find it hard to stop.</p><p>They decide to pop into the park they\u2019d gone to before at night, the one with the lake that reflects the moon perfectly. At this point, since it is a little chilly, Peter gives y/n the coat he\u2019d brought along, draping it over her shoulders. The walk to the park is lovely, with lush flower bushes lining the walkway. Peter stops to pluck a pink flower, tucking it behind y/n\u2019s ear. She thanks him and kisses his cheek.</p><p>Peter and y/n sit on the grass. Since it had been such a nice day, it wasn\u2019t dewy or gross. The grass was soft against Peter\u2019s palms as he leaned back, looking up at the stars. Y/N leans her head on Peter\u2019s shoulders, scooting right next to him. He wraps his arm around her, rubbing her arm comfortingly. There was no conversation in this moment. Just a calm silence between the two of them.</p><p>\u201c<i>Sai, mi piaci davvero Peter. Un sacco/You know, I really like you Peter. A lot</i>.\u201d</p><p>Y/N is looking up at him now. Her face is awfully close to Peter\u2019s, and realizing that makes Peter\u2019s heart palpitate nervously. He couldn\u2019t think of anything to say as he moved a strand of her hair away from her face. When he touched her face, y/n leaned into the palm of his hand, never breaking eye contact with the boy. Before he could overthink this, he moves in and kisses y/n. There lips meeting sends a jolt of electricity through his body, and his senses are on overdrive. He brings up his other hand to hold her face, and y/n wraps her arms loosely around his neck. Her lips taste faintly of the chocolate tarte they\u2019d shared, rich and buttery. Peter could feel her heart racing in her chest, just like his. She was nervous too.</p><p>When they finally pull away, with the moonlight shining down on their faces, they both blush and smile at each other. There wasn\u2019t anything to say; that kiss had said it all.</p><p><i>taglist below the cut</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\"

The group of friends picked a table nearest to the large windows, wanting to feel that good spring warmth on their skin. Everyone seemed to be relaxed, talking about their previous day, and making plans for today. Peter only half listened to the conversation. His eyes kept drifting off to wherever y/n was, checking up on her to see if she was doing alright after he had calmed her down earlier. She seemed to be doing better, keeping a gentle smile on her face as she gathered the leftover dishes from empty tables. She was avoiding Flash&rsquo;s side of the room, and at some point even went as far as asking one of her coworkers to take care of it.</p><p>Ned nudged his leg underneath the table, bringing Peter back to reality. He looked over at him, and Ned jutted his chin in MJ&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Em, what were you saying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was asking if you wanted to help me with a piece I&rsquo;m doing. I want to go to the city&rsquo;s main square.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, for your portfolio?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, wouldn&rsquo;t be more than a few hours at the most. I already asked these two but the lovers already have a date planned for their afternoon.&rdquo; MJ wrinkled her nose playfully towards Ned and Beth as she says the last part, earning a &lsquo;hey!&rsquo; from Beth, who playfully hits her with her napkin. Peter hesitates as he looks over in the direction he had last seen y/n, which was near the kitchen entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, why not. Just let me know what time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After brunch? I need to gather my things but I&rsquo;ll meet you by the front fountain.&rdquo;</p><p>Once the plans were set, the group continues on with brunch. Y/N swoops by gracefully, gathering the empty plates from their table before heading straight to the kitchen. Beth and Ned get up to go get ready for their date, and MJ goes to gather her art things for the afternoon. Peter looks around the room, making sure Flash wasn&rsquo;t around before making his way to the kitchen entrance.</p><p>The sound of the dishes being washed in soap and sanitizer got louder the closer Peter got. There were quick italian words being exchanged between the employees, mostly male, and some laughter here and there. Y/N catches sight of the boy and smiles as she makes her way towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Buongiorno solare/Good morning, sunshine.</i>&rdquo; y/n leans in to peck both of Peter&rsquo;s cheeks, leaving him a rosy cheeked mess.</p><p>&ldquo;Buongiorno principessa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hai qualche piano con i tuoi amici/Do you have plans with your friends?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sto aiutando un'amica con la sua arte oggi. E tu/I&rsquo;m helping a friend with her art today. And you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Only work. I hope you have fun, my Peter.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I see you later? When I get back?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shakes her head and gives him an apologetic smile. &ldquo;<i>Devo finire i compiti prima di domani. Ma forse domani pomeriggio?/I have homework to finish before tomorrow. But maybe tomorrow afternoon?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter lets out a sigh and nods. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date then.&rdquo; he says, causing her to smile.</p><p>After receiving a text from MJ saying she was on her way down, the two exchange a quick goodbye before going to their respective destinations; y/n back to work and Peter to the fountain in front of the hotel.</p><p>The ride into the city was gorgeous. The scenery was so green and alive, the sky was a bright blue, and there wasn&rsquo;t a single cloud in the sky. Peter sat next to MJ silently, who was busy sketching something out in her journal. She was in her own world, leaving Peter to busy himself on his own. His mind wandered back to y/n. It had been a week and a half since they&rsquo;d been keeping their little secret to themselves.

The two just&hellip; clicked. This made everything happen so much easier. Truly the only bump in the road had been Flash. He was&hellip; something.</p><p>MJ and Peter unboard at the city station and discuss where to go. They made a plan to go to the park first, then end their outing at a cafe nearby before they&rsquo;d go back to the hotel. With the sun out, this meant a busier park, which was perfect for MJ. She was doing a realism piece, and she had an idea in her mind on what she wanted that to look like. Her plan was to sketch something out in an indoor location and outdoor location, emphasizing the way the surroundings seemed to encourage people&rsquo;s behavior. It wasn&rsquo;t too long before MJ&rsquo;s chatter died down to silence as she began concentrating once more.</p><p>Peter spent most of his time at the park people watching, from the lone elderly man walking his chihuahua to the young couple watching their toddler run through the grass to chase the birds. The sunshine was putting everyone in a good mood. Eventually after growing bored of his phone and watching people, Peter lays back on the grass and looks up at the cloudless sky. He ends up napping, arms crossed behind his head as the sun kissed his skin. Although he was simply here to keep MJ company, Peter felt relaxed in his own head. The only indication that there was someone there with him was the quick scratching of pencil and paper beside him, and the occasional seated shifting.</p><p>After the two friends&rsquo; day ends with a two hour stay at a nearby cafe, they make their way back to the hotel for dinner. They were meeting Ned and Beth near the Venetian walls first to help them with pictures to commemorate the trip, then together the four of them would head to the hotel, where they were hoping to snag a table outside in the green to watch the sunset as they ate. All in all, their Sunday evening would have a pretty uneventful ending.</p><p>&ldquo;I am starving.&rdquo; Ned groans as he plops onto his bed after a long day out with their class. They had taken the train to another city that was an hour ride away, and there they had a full day cooking class. The class consisted of a lecture on the history of Italian cuisine, some sampling, as well as a walking tour of the michelin star restaurant they were at. Tomorrow would be when they would dip into some food and cook something themselves.</p><p>Peter throws his backpack next to his head and yawns, looking at the time on his watch. They had about half an hour before dinner, which meant he would need to figure out a way to discreetly leave with y/n before then. His friends would know immediately if he was gone; they would obviously notice him not present during dinner. And although Ned somewhat knew the situation, he didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to tell him what was going on.</p><p>Peter paced back and forth nervously, running a hand through his hair as he kept glancing at the time. Ned eyes his friend for a moment before saying anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, are you okay?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I need your help.&rdquo; Peter blurts out. He covers his mouth with his hand, blushing. Ned furrows his brows and sits up.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m going on a date with y/n, you know the girl who works here? And I just need to make it not look suspicious.&rdquo; Peter tells his friend.</p><p>&ldquo;I can just say you have a stomach ache so you&rsquo;re not hungry.&rdquo; Ned shrugs at the boy. Peter&rsquo;s shoulders drop when he realizes that the solution to his dilemma was truly that easy. He wasn&rsquo;t sure why he had been overthinking it.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Ned says, waggling his eyebrows. &ldquo;where are you guys going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dinner. I googled this restaurant where they serve you dinner under the stars and they have those twinkling lights on trees and stuff and I thought she might like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned gives Peter an approving nod. The two chat for a bit more, then Peter changes into a dress shirt and some slacks. He checks his hair in the mirror for the last time that day, then heads out to pick up y/n at her house. He roughly remembered where she lived, except the difference now was that he was walking there during daylight hours. There were people still out and about, and the town wasn&rsquo;t dead yet.</p><p>Peter knocks on the front door and an older woman answers. She has the same kind eyes that y/n has, except she looks a bit more aged. The woman&rsquo;s graying black hair is cut in a blunt bob, which shaped her face nicely.</p><p>&ldquo;Ciao, sono qui per y/n/Hi, I&rsquo;m here for y/n?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, vieni vieni, non c'&egrave; bisogno di essere nervoso/Ah, come come, no need to be nervous.&rdquo; the woman smiles. She ushers Peter inside then calls out for y/n up the stairs. She disappears for a moment, before coming and offering Peter some tea or coffee, both of which Peter declines politely. It wasn&rsquo;t really to save space for dinner; if anything the boy was too nervous to know if he could stomach anything down.</p><p>A few moments later, y/n&rsquo;s footsteps down the stairway become clearer, and she steps into the living room where Peter waits for her. She&rsquo;s taken his breath away, that was how beautiful she looked. Y/N&rsquo;s hair was curled loosely around her shoulders, and she wore a deep red sundress with thin straps. Her skin was glittery from her makeup, and she had a red lipstick on as well. She looked at Peter shyly as he gawked at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; he finally let out. Y/N giggled and shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Voi due state bene, okay/You two be safe, okay?&rdquo; the woman says as the two make their way out.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Okay mamma.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>It is a silent walk to the nearby restaurant. The warm breeze bristled past the pair, past their hands that just brushed against each other as they walked. The hostess checks them in and seats them at one of the many round tables, handing them menus before leaving them alone. Soft music plays from somewhere nearby, creating a relaxing but slightly romantic atmosphere. When Peter looked up at y/n, he saw the sun setting behind her. He couldn&rsquo;t help but whip out his phone and snap a picture of y/n, with the sun hitting her at a great angle. The last one Peter gets is one of her looking up at him, the cutest smile playing on her lips. Satisfied, he puts his phone away.</p><p>Dinner is full of conversation. Y/N seems very interested in learning about Peter&rsquo;s life, so he tells her about him living with his aunt May, whom he adores. He tells her about uncle Ben and his parents, about living in New York, his internship at Stark Industries, etc. Y/N in turn tells Peter about her family, which includes her two older brothers and a baby sister on the way, as well as a cat and a dog. She tells him about her school, the friends she has there, what her dreams are. The conversation just flows and flows, and they find it hard to stop.</p><p>They decide to pop into the park they&rsquo;d gone to before at night, the one with the lake that reflects the moon perfectly. At this point, since it is a little chilly, Peter gives y/n the coat he&rsquo;d brought along, draping it over her shoulders. The walk to the park is lovely, with lush flower bushes lining the walkway. Peter stops to pluck a pink flower, tucking it behind y/n&rsquo;s ear. She thanks him and kisses his cheek.</p><p>Peter and y/n sit on the grass. Since it had been such a nice day, it wasn&rsquo;t dewy or gross. The grass was soft against Peter&rsquo;s palms as he leaned back, looking up at the stars. Y/N leans her head on Peter&rsquo;s shoulders, scooting right next to him. He wraps his arm around her, rubbing her arm comfortingly. There was no conversation in this moment. Just a calm silence between the two of them.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Sai, mi piaci davvero Peter. Un sacco/You know, I really like you Peter. A lot</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N is looking up at him now. Her face is awfully close to Peter&rsquo;s, and realizing that makes Peter&rsquo;s heart palpitate nervously. He couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to say as he moved a strand of her hair away from her face. When he touched her face, y/n leaned into the palm of his hand, never breaking eye contact with the boy. Before he could overthink this, he moves in and kisses y/n. There lips meeting sends a jolt of electricity through his body, and his senses are on overdrive. He brings up his other hand to hold her face, and y/n wraps her arms loosely around his neck. Her lips taste faintly of the chocolate tarte they&rsquo;d shared, rich and buttery. Peter could feel her heart racing in her chest, just like his. She was nervous too.</p><p>When they finally pull away, with the moonlight shining down on their faces, they both blush and smile at each other. There wasn&rsquo;t anything to say; that kiss had said it all.</p><p><i>taglist below the cut</i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\"

The group of friends picked a table nearest to the large windows, wanting to feel that good spring warmth on their skin. Everyone seemed to be relaxed, talking about their previous day, and making plans for today. Peter only half listened to the conversation. His eyes kept drifting off to wherever y/n was, checking up on her to see if she was doing alright after he had calmed her down earlier. She seemed to be doing better, keeping a gentle smile on her face as she gathered the leftover dishes from empty tables. She was avoiding Flash&rsquo;s side of the room, and at some point even went as far as asking one of her coworkers to take care of it.</p>\n<p>Ned nudged his leg underneath the table, bringing Peter back to reality. He looked over at him, and Ned jutted his chin in MJ&rsquo;s direction.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry Em, what were you saying?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was asking if you wanted to help me with a piece I&rsquo;m doing. I want to go to the city&rsquo;s main square.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, for your portfolio?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, wouldn&rsquo;t be more than a few hours at the most. I already asked these two but the lovers already have a date planned for their afternoon.&rdquo; MJ wrinkled her nose playfully towards Ned and Beth as she says the last part, earning a &lsquo;hey!&rsquo; from Beth, who playfully hits her with her napkin. Peter hesitates as he looks over in the direction he had last seen y/n, which was near the kitchen entrance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, why not. Just let me know what time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;After brunch? I need to gather my things but I&rsquo;ll meet you by the front fountain.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Once the plans were set, the group continues on with brunch. Y/N swoops by gracefully, gathering the empty plates from their table before heading straight to the kitchen. Beth and Ned get up to go get ready for their date, and MJ goes to gather her art things for the afternoon. Peter looks around the room, making sure Flash wasn&rsquo;t around before making his way to the kitchen entrance.</p>\n<p>The sound of the dishes being washed in soap and sanitizer got louder the closer Peter got. There were quick italian words being exchanged between the employees, mostly male, and some laughter here and there. Y/N catches sight of the boy and smiles as she makes her way towards him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Buongiorno solare/Good morning, sunshine.</i>&rdquo; y/n leans in to peck both of Peter&rsquo;s cheeks, leaving him a rosy cheeked mess.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Buongiorno principessa.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Hai qualche piano con i tuoi amici/Do you have plans with your friends?</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sto aiutando un'amica con la sua arte oggi. E tu/I&rsquo;m helping a friend with her art today. And you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Only work. I hope you have fun, my Peter.</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can I see you later? When I get back?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Y/N shakes her head and gives him an apologetic smile. &ldquo;<i>Devo finire i compiti prima di domani. Ma forse domani pomeriggio?/I have homework to finish before tomorrow. But maybe tomorrow afternoon?</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter lets out a sigh and nods. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date then.&rdquo; he says, causing her to smile.</p>\n</p>",

You\u2019ll sometimes be woken up by crashing into the floor because somehow he simultaneously kicked and punched you off the bed. But y\u2019all\u00a0can get competitive so the night turns into a weird subconscious competition to see who would end up in the strangest position (don\u2019t) and you\u2019ll wake up with the sun streaming in and Thor\u2019s calf in your face.

He\u2019s usually face down and snoring gently with his ass slightly raised in the air (he sleeps like a baby tbh), but usually, if the two of you are together in the morning he would have found a way to snuggle into the crook of your neck and you\u2019ll usually wake up before him and see him snoring into your neck wondering how the hell he got there. You\u2019ll normally run your hands through his hair a few times while looking at his peaceful face (he\u2019s protective and dominant during the day but during the night you usually end up cradling him because he has vUlNerAbILItiEs and he feels comfortable around you) but necessity would require you to get up and just when you think you\u2019re in the clear once out of bed he\u2019ll miraculously wake up and in a blue blur you\u2019ll find yourself back in bed again (*wink wink* Pietro is horny 24/7 and sexytimes in the morning is very common but let\u2019s not get into that today.)</p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"471\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3cbe442b52c2fef680ba83d66fa29d57/tumblr_inline_pq8herma9z1txtl2u_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"471\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><ul><li><b>Bucky</b></li></ul><p>Kind of like Steve in that despite him having his memories the trauma of being HYDRA\u2019s personal lapdog and the rigorous\u00a0routine he was put through would still affect him so he would often wake up way earlier than you. He\u2019ll either wake up normally or wake up a sweaty and panting mess during which you\u2019d wake up as well and bring him back to Earth, in these situations you\u2019d also end up sorta cradling him and soothing him. But other than that he\u2019ll wake up, go for a workout, make breakfast, go for a run, have a shower and be back in the bedroom before you even start to stir.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"268\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e073643796cef46ba1d3ce9ab41fa30/tumblr_inline_pnk0747dkR1txtl2u_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"268\"/></figure><ul><li><b>Bruce</b></li></ul><p>Bruce stirs easily, frequently waking up in the middle of the night just to make sure you\u2019re still with him. You almost always wake up, resting your head against his chest. Normally when he\u2019s by himself he\u2019d be an early riser but with you he simply can\u2019t look away from you or even attempt to move for fear of waking you up. Sometimes if he\u2019s been up all night working and crashing into bed at 3am you\u2019ll wake up before him and get up to make breakfast. Then you two chat like an old married couple (you\u2019re both old souls) talking about the other Avengers as if they were your rambunctious children, both of you leaning against the headboard with your cups of coffee contentedly.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"295\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/782250b22a67939c09c29fbff4fc844d/tumblr_inline_pnk0anjsno1txtl2u_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"295\"/></figure><ul><li><b>Peter</b></li></ul><p>(Y\u2019all are of age in this but let\u2019s face it, teenagers can do the do we all know it goes down sometimes but anyways)</p><p>So Peter and you normally wake up in two positions. A) He is lying into your neck or on your chest with you craning your neck slightly to meet the shape of his head. Or B) You are both facing each other, your foreheads centimetres apart and your hands gracing each other, almost as if they gravitated toward one another during the night. Either way, you both normally wake up at the same time and chat together about whatever because conversation comes easy to you guys. You\u2019ll then get up and make breakfast together, sometimes there\u2019ll be a cheeky food fight but like you guys normally are smart enough to think ahead and see the mess you\u2019ll have to clean up. You two have developed this routine which is Peter\u2019s favourite time of day because A) He gets to wake up next to you and B) It adds a sense of normality to his chaotic world.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"350\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ccf84e03be57223ccd8b89219a6e6bb/tumblr_inline_pnk0e8S8EE1txtl2u_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"350\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><ul><li><b>Clint</b></li></ul><p>Clint is very protective of you so he always puts and arm around you or is holding you as close as possible (one time he literally wrapped you in his legs). He\u2019ll wake up before you but you follow shortly, often trying to escape your Clint-Prison before resigning to your fate. Quite like Bruce, you two get up and have breakfast at the table and chat about what\u2019s on the agenda and getting on like an old married couple. While he is witty and sarcastic he can also be quiet and guarded but he always loosens up around you, sometimes you\u2019ll scoot your chair next to his and lean on his shoulder with your cups of coffee in your hands, simply existing in a comfortable silence.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"185\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6a3d3ec3081d704800592e29b17f77cd/tumblr_inline_pnjxd0Fb6p1txtl2u_250.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"185\"/></figure>",

Then you two chat like an old married couple (you&rsquo;re both old souls) talking about the other Avengers as if they were your rambunctious children, both of you leaning against the headboard with your cups of coffee contentedly.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/782250b22a67939c09c29fbff4fc844d/tumblr_inline_pnk0anjsno1txtl2u_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><ul><li><b>Peter</b></li></ul><p>(Y&rsquo;all are of age in this but let&rsquo;s face it, teenagers can do the do we all know it goes down sometimes but anyways)</p><p>So Peter and you normally wake up in two positions. A) He is lying into your neck or on your chest with you craning your neck slightly to meet the shape of his head. Or B) You are both facing each other, your foreheads centimetres apart and your hands gracing each other, almost as if they gravitated toward one another during the night. Either way, you both normally wake up at the same time and chat together about whatever because conversation comes easy to you guys. You&rsquo;ll then get up and make breakfast together, sometimes there&rsquo;ll be a cheeky food fight but like you guys normally are smart enough to think ahead and see the mess you&rsquo;ll have to clean up. You two have developed this routine which is Peter&rsquo;s favourite time of day because A) He gets to wake up next to you and B) It adds a sense of normality to his chaotic world.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ccf84e03be57223ccd8b89219a6e6bb/tumblr_inline_pnk0e8S8EE1txtl2u_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><ul><li><b>Clint</b></li></ul><p>Clint is very protective of you so he always puts and arm around you or is holding you as close as possible (one time he literally wrapped you in his legs). He&rsquo;ll wake up before you but you follow shortly, often trying to escape your Clint-Prison before resigning to your fate. Quite like Bruce, you two get up and have breakfast at the table and chat about what&rsquo;s on the agenda and getting on like an old married couple. While he is witty and sarcastic he can also be quiet and guarded but he always loosens up around you, sometimes you&rsquo;ll scoot your chair next to his and lean on his shoulder with your cups of coffee in your hands, simply existing in a comfortable silence.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6a3d3ec3081d704800592e29b17f77cd/tumblr_inline_pnjxd0Fb6p1txtl2u_250.png\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",
