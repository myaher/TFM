They used that Draco being sickly in Half Blood Prince and how he has never had a death eater mark shown in the movies/books and how a wolf was a friend of Draco&rsquo;s family. One, I haven&rsquo;t reached Half Blood Prince but with the power of spoilers and wiki, its confirmed Draco was looking sickly at that point in time as he was suddenly afraid of the task at hand- aka kill Dumbledore- and therefore, was mentally stressed out and a bit terrified, which combined, can make you look sickly but stress alone can make you go pale. Two, the books are in Harrys POV we must remember here and therefore maybe he never saw Draco&rsquo;s mark, but also he may be an unofficial death eater who never got his mark, but again Pottermore confirmed years ago actually, that he was a death eater so he does have a mark, he just doesn&rsquo;t show it. Three, a wearwolf being the family friend doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;d bite the family unless reasons, which apparently according to this video was punishment for Lucious but again&hellip;.why bite Draco.

I ask, would even five hundred points would have been enough for the way he bravely agreed to sacrifice himself during the game of wizard chess? He could have gotten seriously hurt or worse died. Also, he managed to beat McGonagall&rsquo;s chess set which isn&rsquo;t a small accomplishment at all. </p><p>- You people complain about Hermione being awarded fifty points. I ask, would even five hundred points would have been enough for the way she solved Snape&rsquo;s potion riddle? It wasn&rsquo;t an easy task. They could have gotten poisoned if she had been wrong. So she definitely deserved her share of points. </p><p>- You people complain about Neville being awarded ten points, I ask would even hundred points be enough for the type of courage he showed? He was standing up to his own friends. Probably the only friends he had made in the school because he didn&rsquo;t wanted them to lose any more house points. Isn&rsquo;t that deserving of points? </p><p>- Finally, you complain about Harry being awarded sixty points. I ask whether even six hundred points would have been enough for the level of courage he displayed. He went to face Voldemort alone, knowing that he wasn&rsquo;t trained enough or ready for that. Knowing fully well that he could die. All because he wanted to stop Voldemort. Did Harry really not deserve the points he got? </p><p>So there is no need to shit on Gryffindor just because your favorite house didn&rsquo;t won the house cup. I am sick of all those jokes made about this last scene from the movie or the book. It feels like people are shitting on everything done by Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville on that day, just because they are salty about Slytherin not winning. </p>",

I ask, would even five hundred points would have been enough for the way he bravely agreed to sacrifice himself during the game of wizard chess? He could have gotten seriously hurt or worse died. Also, he managed to beat McGonagall\u2019s chess set which isn\u2019t a small accomplishment at all. </p><p>- You people complain about Hermione being awarded fifty points. I ask, would even five hundred points would have been enough for the way she solved Snape\u2019s potion riddle? It wasn\u2019t an easy task. They could have gotten poisoned if she had been wrong. So she definitely deserved her share of points. </p><p>- You people complain about Neville being awarded ten points, I ask would even hundred points be enough for the type of courage he showed? He was standing up to his own friends. Probably the only friends he had made in the school because he didn\u2019t wanted them to lose any more house points. Isn\u2019t that deserving of points? </p><p>- Finally, you complain about Harry being awarded sixty points. I ask whether even six hundred points would have been enough for the level of courage he displayed. He went to face Voldemort alone, knowing that he wasn\u2019t trained enough or ready for that. Knowing fully well that he could die. All because he wanted to stop Voldemort. Did Harry really not deserve the points he got? </p><p>So there is no need to shit on Gryffindor just because your favorite house didn\u2019t won the house cup. I am sick of all those jokes made about this last scene from the movie or the book. It feels like people are shitting on everything done by Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville on that day, just because they are salty about Slytherin not winning. </p>",
