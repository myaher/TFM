He was walking towards the window past the table Taehyung had placed it on after Mark had tried to contact you as you slept, ironically so it wouldn\u2019t get lost. He saw the screen light up and reached out to hold it up for his friend. <b>\u201cWho\u2019s phone is this?\u201d</b></p><p>Taehyung raised his eyes at the question and then leapt instantly and clumsily from his seat as his gaze fell on the unfamiliar handset. He snatched it from Jimin and gawked open-mouthed at the phone, seemingly a thousand thoughts jumping to his mind all at once. This was his way to find you, right? But, what if it was Mark trying to call you again? The image of his face wasn\u2019t smirking back at him from the screen as it had before though, and this number didn\u2019t have any name or photo attached to it.</p><p>Jimin stared dumbfounded at his inaction. \u201c<b>Are you going to answer it or stare at it?\u201d</b> but it was as if he hadn\u2019t heard the question, and he cradled it in his hand, gazing mutely at the illuminated display. <b>\u201cTaehyung-ah!\u201d</b> finally having enough he grabbed the phone back from him, startling him back in to reality, just in time for the phone to go dark as the caller gave up.</p><p><b>\u201cWhat do I do, Jimin?\u201d</b></p><p>He recognised the baffled expression on Taehyung\u2019s face, he had seen it often, his eyes widened to almost twice their normal size, his lips slightly pouted. <b>\u201cWell, you usually pick them up when they ring. There\u2019s a little green picture of a phone and you \u2013 \u201d</b></p><!-- more --><p><b>\u201cJimin-ah! It\u2019s her phone!\u201d</b> He was at a loss, a spark of hope ignited in him when Jimin held up your phone, and he all of a sudden forgot what to do with his hands, flexing and relaxing his fingers uselessly and shifting his gaze between the handset and Jimin\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t know exactly what it was he was hoping for, he just knew that if he didn\u2019t at least get the chance to see you again, it would play on his mind for far too long.</p><p><b>\u201cLook, here\u2019s the number that called,\u201d</b> Taehyung nodded at Jimin\u2019s soothing tone, and though a blank expression still dominated his face, he found himself more grateful than usual that his dearest friend was there with him. <b>\u201cCall it, they might know how to find her.\u201d</b></p><p>Both men held their breath without realising as the dialling tone commenced on the other end of the phone, the otherwise silent room lending itself well to the soft thud of Taehyung\u2019s pulse beating in his ears. Then, after what felt like hours the ringing stopped and he heard your voice again. It occurred to him that the last time he had heard you speak was when you said his name for the first time. He inhaled deeply in an effort to calm his pounding heart \u201cHello&hellip;y/n?\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cIs it her?\u201d</b> Jimin bounded up to where Taehyung was standing stock-still, gripping the phone in his hand impossibly tight. In his attempt to push his head near the speaker to finally hear the voice of the girl he had heard so much about, he almost knocked it from Taehyung\u2019s hand. Scrambling to regain his grasp on the handset, he pushed Jimin only lightly, but enough to catch him off balance and he stumbled backwards in to the large sideboard on which the television set sat. <b>\u201cYa!\u201d</b> he cried out indignantly, but his smitten friend, ignorant to the distress he had caused, simply repeated your name again with a sigh, his eyes closing slowly in a display of relief.</p><p>Later, Jimin would ask him how it felt when he realised it was you on the other end of the line. Taehyung would struggle to describe accurately how the sensation shook his entire body, how he somehow wanted to laugh and cry with relief at the same time. He would only just be able to articulate the emotion he felt when he finally heard you say his name again: joy.</p><p> ~~~</p><p>The entire conversation felt utterly surreal. You cringed at your voice involuntary increasing in volume when it seemed like he was having difficulty taking in what you were saying, and you felt guilty that it was him having to adjust to you and not more of a mutual exchange. </p><p>The task at hand, at least on the surface, was to arrange a way for Taehyung to return your phone to you.</p><p>\u201cYou are coming back?\u201d You could picture him enunciating the words carefully, the image all too vivid in your head of how his lips looked when his forehead pressed against your own, telling you how he wanted to kiss you.</p><p>Grateful that there was no one to see the blood rush to your face at the memory, you answered his question. \u201cYes, I need to get my car too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour car&hellip;when?\u201d You could still hear incoherent muttering in the background as Taehyung spoke, and you were almost certain you could hear him hiss under his breath to whomever was in the room with him as he tried to concentrate on your conversation.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t had more than a sip of the beer that Ronnie had offered you on your arrival, but you thought it may be a couple more hours at least before you attempted to get back behind the steering wheel. \u201cUm, maybe about four o\u2019clock.\u201d That should give you plenty of time to get back to the bar and start your shift at six that night, having agreed last minute to work that evening, so Ronnie could go out and meet his friends he sometimes played cards with.</p><p><i>\u201cMyeossie sijagae?\u201d</i> You could tell he\u2019d moved his face away from the phone to pose the phantom mutterer a question, and you heard him hum softly in acknowledgment to whatever the answer had been. \u201cNot later?\u201d He spoke in to the mic again and asked you, with what sounded like hope lacing the question. \u201cI can see you at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work at six,\u201d you responded, regret clear in your tone. You briefly wondered if you could wait till the next day to get your phone back, just so you could still use it as an excuse to see him again. Then you remembered that you needed to collect everything you owned that following day, and to delay that just to meet a virtual stranger for a few moments just seemed so frivolous, no matter how much your heart might be crying out for it. \u201cYou could leave it at the front desk for me,\u201d you suggested reluctantly, still uncertain if he was as keen to see you as you were him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d You had barely finished the sentence before Taehyung blurted out his disagreement. \u201cI will come to you.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, but pleasantly so, at his adamance to hand you your device back in person, you arranged to use Ronnie\u2019s phone to text him the address, both of you knowing it would be far easier than trying to explain it verbally.</p><p>You hung up the bar phone again, pins and needles shooting through your fingers as a result of gripping the handset too tight, and looked at the clock, assessing how much time you had physically and mentally to prepare yourself.</p><p>~~~ </p><p>Later that evening, your car retrieved and around ten minutes until eight o\u2019clock, you checked your reflection as discreetly as you were able in the mirror which made up the back of the bar, between half empty bottles of scotch and brandy for the tenth time that minute.</p><p>Ronnie, who was waiting for his ride to the card game, sat perched on a stool with his elbows resting on the bar top, eyeballing you with thinly-veiled amusement as he took a swig from his beer bottle. \u201cYou expecting to see someone special, y/n?\u201d he enquired curiously, nudging one of the regulars \u2013 Peter \u2013 beside him.</p><p>In all the time you had worked at the bar you had been with Mark, and Ronnie had certainly never seen you this twitchy about him arriving. He had vaguely heard your side of the conversation on the bar phone earlier, but aside from a few stutters here and there and maybe a solitary giggle escaping you, it hardly sounded like you were arranging some great, passionate rendezvous. Even if you had, he highly doubted you would arrange it at the bar on a night you were working.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d You pulled your eyes away from a particularly stubborn tuft of hair which stuck out ludicrously on one side of your head and turned to where he was sitting, an uncertain grimace plastered across your face.</p><p>\u201cThis person bringing your phone, is it someone you know well?\u201d Ronnie was asking in a teasing tone, but the questioning boiled down to the fact that he was concerned about you. </p><p>He had always worried about you. You were too soft, too trusting, too quick to put other&rsquo;s needs before your own. Ronnie knew that \u2013 on paper \u2013 this was not necessarily a bad thing, but he had seen one too many people take advantage of your gentle nature and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to stop himself from retaliating on your behalf this time, the way he had restrained himself with Mark countless times, and with your own parents years ago.</p><p>You leant over the bar and, recognising the concealed paternal fretting beneath the taunting colour of his question, grasped his free hand in both of your own. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, Ronnie. He\u2019s just someone I met last night. He helped me after&hellip;everything.\u201d</p><p>You felt your ears heat up at the recollection, and the coy expression on your face was not lost on your boss. \u201cOh right, okay. And what is it exactly he wants your help with?\u201d You clapped your hands around his in an &lsquo;I\u2019m done talking about this with you&rsquo; kind of gesture and he saw your eyes dart up to the clock: almost seven fifty-five.</p><p>Before he could make any further comment, Ronnie\u2019s phone vibrated loudly across the bar top, signalling the arrival of his ride. He leant over the bar and ruffled your hair, causing a second tuft to rise up in sympathy on the other side of your head, and asked you to be careful. </p><p>As usual you promised you would be and vowed to call the police and him (in that order) should anything occur. Not like any of the guys who drank in here would ever allow anything to happen \u2013 though they would swear gruffly that was more for the bar\u2019s sake than for yours. Frowning slightly and turning back to your reflection behind you, you tried again to smooth down the unruly mop on your head.</p><p>Draining the rest of his bottle, Ronnie dragged his jacket from the stool beside him and headed towards the front door. Just before he reached the exit, the door was pushed open from the outside and two young men walked in. The head of the taller of the two came to just above Ronnie\u2019s jawline and the shorter one just about reached his shoulder. Based on the fact that the apparent age of the new arrivals was perhaps just about a third of the bar&rsquo;s usual clientele, Ronnie assumed that these boys were here to return your phone.</p><p>Which one was responsible for your blushed cheeks and sudden interest in your own appearance, though? He hoped it was the shorter of the two, he seemed to have the correct combination of apprehension and respect on his face when he\u2019d almost walked in to Ronnie just a moment ago. The taller boy however, was seemingly oblivious to his presence, his eyes scanning the bar keenly until his gaze fell on you, a large breath escaping him as he did so. And the second Ronnie saw you whip your head around to meet the young man\u2019s eyes, it was glaringly apparent whose arrival you had spent the whole evening \u2013 perhaps longer - waiting for.<br/></p><p><b><i>A/N (another one!) - Hi again, truly thank you to those of you who are taking the time to read this, I really am thankful for every single note!

He was walking towards the window past the table Taehyung had placed it on after Mark had tried to contact you as you slept, ironically so it wouldn\u2019t get lost. He saw the screen light up and reached out to hold it up for his friend. <b>\u201cWho\u2019s phone is this?\u201d</b></p><p>Taehyung raised his eyes at the question and then leapt instantly and clumsily from his seat as his gaze fell on the unfamiliar handset. He snatched it from Jimin and gawked open-mouthed at the phone, seemingly a thousand thoughts jumping to his mind all at once. This was his way to find you, right? But, what if it was Mark trying to call you again? The image of his face wasn\u2019t smirking back at him from the screen as it had before though, and this number didn\u2019t have any name or photo attached to it.</p><p>Jimin stared dumbfounded at his inaction. \u201c<b>Are you going to answer it or stare at it?\u201d</b> but it was as if he hadn\u2019t heard the question, and he cradled it in his hand, gazing mutely at the illuminated display. <b>\u201cTaehyung-ah!\u201d</b> finally having enough he grabbed the phone back from him, startling him back in to reality, just in time for the phone to go dark as the caller gave up.</p><p><b>\u201cWhat do I do, Jimin?\u201d</b></p><p>He recognised the baffled expression on Taehyung\u2019s face, he had seen it often, his eyes widened to almost twice their normal size, his lips slightly pouted. <b>\u201cWell, you usually pick them up when they ring. There\u2019s a little green picture of a phone and you \u2013 \u201d</b></p>[[MORE]]<p><b>\u201cJimin-ah! It\u2019s her phone!\u201d</b> He was at a loss, a spark of hope ignited in him when Jimin held up your phone, and he all of a sudden forgot what to do with his hands, flexing and relaxing his fingers uselessly and shifting his gaze between the handset and Jimin\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t know exactly what it was he was hoping for, he just knew that if he didn\u2019t at least get the chance to see you again, it would play on his mind for far too long.</p><p><b>\u201cLook, here\u2019s the number that called,\u201d</b> Taehyung nodded at Jimin\u2019s soothing tone, and though a blank expression still dominated his face, he found himself more grateful than usual that his dearest friend was there with him. <b>\u201cCall it, they might know how to find her.\u201d</b></p><p>Both men held their breath without realising as the dialling tone commenced on the other end of the phone, the otherwise silent room lending itself well to the soft thud of Taehyung\u2019s pulse beating in his ears. Then, after what felt like hours the ringing stopped and he heard your voice again. It occurred to him that the last time he had heard you speak was when you said his name for the first time. He inhaled deeply in an effort to calm his pounding heart \u201cHello\u2026y/n?\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cIs it her?\u201d</b> Jimin bounded up to where Taehyung was standing stock-still, gripping the phone in his hand impossibly tight. In his attempt to push his head near the speaker to finally hear the voice of the girl he had heard so much about, he almost knocked it from Taehyung\u2019s hand. Scrambling to regain his grasp on the handset, he pushed Jimin only lightly, but enough to catch him off balance and he stumbled backwards in to the large sideboard on which the television set sat. <b>\u201cYa!\u201d</b> he cried out indignantly, but his smitten friend, ignorant to the distress he had caused, simply repeated your name again with a sigh, his eyes closing slowly in a display of relief.</p><p>Later, Jimin would ask him how it felt when he realised it was you on the other end of the line. Taehyung would struggle to describe accurately how the sensation shook his entire body, how he somehow wanted to laugh and cry with relief at the same time. He would only just be able to articulate the emotion he felt when he finally heard you say his name again: joy.</p><p> ~~~</p><p>The entire conversation felt utterly surreal. You cringed at your voice involuntary increasing in volume when it seemed like he was having difficulty taking in what you were saying, and you felt guilty that it was him having to adjust to you and not more of a mutual exchange. </p><p>The task at hand, at least on the surface, was to arrange a way for Taehyung to return your phone to you.</p><p>\u201cYou are coming back?\u201d You could picture him enunciating the words carefully, the image all too vivid in your head of how his lips looked when his forehead pressed against your own, telling you how he wanted to kiss you.</p><p>Grateful that there was no one to see the blood rush to your face at the memory, you answered his question. \u201cYes, I need to get my car too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour car\u2026when?\u201d You could still hear incoherent muttering in the background as Taehyung spoke, and you were almost certain you could hear him hiss under his breath to whomever was in the room with him as he tried to concentrate on your conversation.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t had more than a sip of the beer that Ronnie had offered you on your arrival, but you thought it may be a couple more hours at least before you attempted to get back behind the steering wheel. \u201cUm, maybe about four o\u2019clock.\u201d That should give you plenty of time to get back to the bar and start your shift at six that night, having agreed last minute to work that evening, so Ronnie could go out and meet his friends he sometimes played cards with.</p><p><i>\u201cMyeossie sijagae?\u201d</i> You could tell he\u2019d moved his face away from the phone to pose the phantom mutterer a question, and you heard him hum softly in acknowledgment to whatever the answer had been. \u201cNot later?\u201d He spoke in to the mic again and asked you, with what sounded like hope lacing the question. \u201cI can see you at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work at six,\u201d you responded, regret clear in your tone. You briefly wondered if you could wait till the next day to get your phone back, just so you could still use it as an excuse to see him again. Then you remembered that you needed to collect everything you owned that following day, and to delay that just to meet a virtual stranger for a few moments just seemed so frivolous, no matter how much your heart might be crying out for it. \u201cYou could leave it at the front desk for me,\u201d you suggested reluctantly, still uncertain if he was as keen to see you as you were him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d You had barely finished the sentence before Taehyung blurted out his disagreement. \u201cI will come to you.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, but pleasantly so, at his adamance to hand you your device back in person, you arranged to use Ronnie\u2019s phone to text him the address, both of you knowing it would be far easier than trying to explain it verbally.</p><p>You hung up the bar phone again, pins and needles shooting through your fingers as a result of gripping the handset too tight, and looked at the clock, assessing how much time you had physically and mentally to prepare yourself.</p><p>~~~ </p><p>Later that evening, your car retrieved and around ten minutes until eight o\u2019clock, you checked your reflection as discreetly as you were able in the mirror which made up the back of the bar, between half empty bottles of scotch and brandy for the tenth time that minute.</p><p>Ronnie, who was waiting for his ride to the card game, sat perched on a stool with his elbows resting on the bar top, eyeballing you with thinly-veiled amusement as he took a swig from his beer bottle. \u201cYou expecting to see someone special, y/n?\u201d he enquired curiously, nudging one of the regulars \u2013 Peter \u2013 beside him.</p><p>In all the time you had worked at the bar you had been with Mark, and Ronnie had certainly never seen you this twitchy about him arriving. He had vaguely heard your side of the conversation on the bar phone earlier, but aside from a few stutters here and there and maybe a solitary giggle escaping you, it hardly sounded like you were arranging some great, passionate rendezvous. Even if you had, he highly doubted you would arrange it at the bar on a night you were working.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d You pulled your eyes away from a particularly stubborn tuft of hair which stuck out ludicrously on one side of your head and turned to where he was sitting, an uncertain grimace plastered across your face.</p><p>\u201cThis person bringing your phone, is it someone you know well?\u201d Ronnie was asking in a teasing tone, but the questioning boiled down to the fact that he was concerned about you. </p><p>He had always worried about you. You were too soft, too trusting, too quick to put other\u2019s needs before your own. Ronnie knew that \u2013 on paper \u2013 this was not necessarily a bad thing, but he had seen one too many people take advantage of your gentle nature and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to stop himself from retaliating on your behalf this time, the way he had restrained himself with Mark countless times, and with your own parents years ago.</p><p>You leant over the bar and, recognising the concealed paternal fretting beneath the taunting colour of his question, grasped his free hand in both of your own. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, Ronnie. He\u2019s just someone I met last night. He helped me after\u2026everything.\u201d</p><p>You felt your ears heat up at the recollection, and the coy expression on your face was not lost on your boss. \u201cOh right, okay. And what is it exactly he wants your help with?\u201d You clapped your hands around his in an \u2018I\u2019m done talking about this with you\u2019 kind of gesture and he saw your eyes dart up to the clock: almost seven fifty-five.</p><p>Before he could make any further comment, Ronnie\u2019s phone vibrated loudly across the bar top, signalling the arrival of his ride. He leant over the bar and ruffled your hair, causing a second tuft to rise up in sympathy on the other side of your head, and asked you to be careful. </p><p>As usual you promised you would be and vowed to call the police and him (in that order) should anything occur. Not like any of the guys who drank in here would ever allow anything to happen \u2013 though they would swear gruffly that was more for the bar\u2019s sake than for yours. Frowning slightly and turning back to your reflection behind you, you tried again to smooth down the unruly mop on your head.</p><p>Draining the rest of his bottle, Ronnie dragged his jacket from the stool beside him and headed towards the front door. Just before he reached the exit, the door was pushed open from the outside and two young men walked in. The head of the taller of the two came to just above Ronnie\u2019s jawline and the shorter one just about reached his shoulder. Based on the fact that the apparent age of the new arrivals was perhaps just about a third of the bar\u2019s usual clientele, Ronnie assumed that these boys were here to return your phone.</p><p>Which one was responsible for your blushed cheeks and sudden interest in your own appearance, though? He hoped it was the shorter of the two, he seemed to have the correct combination of apprehension and respect on his face when he\u2019d almost walked in to Ronnie just a moment ago. The taller boy however, was seemingly oblivious to his presence, his eyes scanning the bar keenly until his gaze fell on you, a large breath escaping him as he did so. And the second Ronnie saw you whip your head around to meet the young man\u2019s eyes, it was glaringly apparent whose arrival you had spent the whole evening \u2013 perhaps longer - waiting for.<br></p><p><b><i>A/N (another one!) - Hi again, truly thank you to those of you who are taking the time to read this, I really am thankful for every single note!

There\u2019s a little green picture of a phone and you \u2013 \u201d</b></p>[[MORE]]<p><b>\u201cJimin-ah! It\u2019s her phone!\u201d</b> He was at a loss, a spark of hope ignited in him when Jimin held up your phone, and he all of a sudden forgot what to do with his hands, flexing and relaxing his fingers uselessly and shifting his gaze between the handset and Jimin\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t know exactly what it was he was hoping for, he just knew that if he didn\u2019t at least get the chance to see you again, it would play on his mind for far too long.</p><p><b>\u201cLook, here\u2019s the number that called,\u201d</b> Taehyung nodded at Jimin\u2019s soothing tone, and though a blank expression still dominated his face, he found himself more grateful than usual that his dearest friend was there with him. <b>\u201cCall it, they might know how to find her.\u201d</b></p><p>Both men held their breath without realising as the dialling tone commenced on the other end of the phone, the otherwise silent room lending itself well to the soft thud of Taehyung\u2019s pulse beating in his ears. Then, after what felt like hours the ringing stopped and he heard your voice again. It occurred to him that the last time he had heard you speak was when you said his name for the first time. He inhaled deeply in an effort to calm his pounding heart \u201cHello\u2026y/n?\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cIs it her?\u201d</b> Jimin bounded up to where Taehyung was standing stock-still, gripping the phone in his hand impossibly tight. In his attempt to push his head near the speaker to finally hear the voice of the girl he had heard so much about, he almost knocked it from Taehyung\u2019s hand. Scrambling to regain his grasp on the handset, he pushed Jimin only lightly, but enough to catch him off balance and he stumbled backwards in to the large sideboard on which the television set sat. <b>\u201cYa!\u201d</b> he cried out indignantly, but his smitten friend, ignorant to the distress he had caused, simply repeated your name again with a sigh, his eyes closing slowly in a display of relief.</p><p>Later, Jimin would ask him how it felt when he realised it was you on the other end of the line. Taehyung would struggle to describe accurately how the sensation shook his entire body, how he somehow wanted to laugh and cry with relief at the same time. He would only just be able to articulate the emotion he felt when he finally heard you say his name again: joy.</p><p> ~~~</p><p>The entire conversation felt utterly surreal. You cringed at your voice involuntary increasing in volume when it seemed like he was having difficulty taking in what you were saying, and you felt guilty that it was him having to adjust to you and not more of a mutual exchange. </p><p>The task at hand, at least on the surface, was to arrange a way for Taehyung to return your phone to you.</p><p>\u201cYou are coming back?\u201d You could picture him enunciating the words carefully, the image all too vivid in your head of how his lips looked when his forehead pressed against your own, telling you how he wanted to kiss you.</p><p>Grateful that there was no one to see the blood rush to your face at the memory, you answered his question. \u201cYes, I need to get my car too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour car\u2026when?\u201d You could still hear incoherent muttering in the background as Taehyung spoke, and you were almost certain you could hear him hiss under his breath to whomever was in the room with him as he tried to concentrate on your conversation.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t had more than a sip of the beer that Ronnie had offered you on your arrival, but you thought it may be a couple more hours at least before you attempted to get back behind the steering wheel. \u201cUm, maybe about four o\u2019clock.\u201d That should give you plenty of time to get back to the bar and start your shift at six that night, having agreed last minute to work that evening, so Ronnie could go out and meet his friends he sometimes played cards with.</p><p><i>\u201cMyeossie sijagae?\u201d</i> You could tell he\u2019d moved his face away from the phone to pose the phantom mutterer a question, and you heard him hum softly in acknowledgment to whatever the answer had been. \u201cNot later?\u201d He spoke in to the mic again and asked you, with what sounded like hope lacing the question. \u201cI can see you at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work at six,\u201d you responded, regret clear in your tone. You briefly wondered if you could wait till the next day to get your phone back, just so you could still use it as an excuse to see him again. Then you remembered that you needed to collect everything you owned that following day, and to delay that just to meet a virtual stranger for a few moments just seemed so frivolous, no matter how much your heart might be crying out for it. \u201cYou could leave it at the front desk for me,\u201d you suggested reluctantly, still uncertain if he was as keen to see you as you were him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d You had barely finished the sentence before Taehyung blurted out his disagreement. \u201cI will come to you.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, but pleasantly so, at his adamance to hand you your device back in person, you arranged to use Ronnie\u2019s phone to text him the address, both of you knowing it would be far easier than trying to explain it verbally.</p><p>You hung up the bar phone again, pins and needles shooting through your fingers as a result of gripping the handset too tight, and looked at the clock, assessing how much time you had physically and mentally to prepare yourself.</p><p>~~~ </p><p>Later that evening, your car retrieved and around ten minutes until eight o\u2019clock, you checked your reflection as discreetly as you were able in the mirror which made up the back of the bar, between half empty bottles of scotch and brandy for the tenth time that minute.</p><p>Ronnie, who was waiting for his ride to the card game, sat perched on a stool with his elbows resting on the bar top, eyeballing you with thinly-veiled amusement as he took a swig from his beer bottle. \u201cYou expecting to see someone special, y/n?\u201d he enquired curiously, nudging one of the regulars \u2013 Peter \u2013 beside him.</p><p>In all the time you had worked at the bar you had been with Mark, and Ronnie had certainly never seen you this twitchy about him arriving. He had vaguely heard your side of the conversation on the bar phone earlier, but aside from a few stutters here and there and maybe a solitary giggle escaping you, it hardly sounded like you were arranging some great, passionate rendezvous. Even if you had, he highly doubted you would arrange it at the bar on a night you were working.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d You pulled your eyes away from a particularly stubborn tuft of hair which stuck out ludicrously on one side of your head and turned to where he was sitting, an uncertain grimace plastered across your face.</p><p>\u201cThis person bringing your phone, is it someone you know well?\u201d Ronnie was asking in a teasing tone, but the questioning boiled down to the fact that he was concerned about you. </p><p>He had always worried about you. You were too soft, too trusting, too quick to put other\u2019s needs before your own. Ronnie knew that \u2013 on paper \u2013 this was not necessarily a bad thing, but he had seen one too many people take advantage of your gentle nature and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to stop himself from retaliating on your behalf this time, the way he had restrained himself with Mark countless times, and with your own parents years ago.</p><p>You leant over the bar and, recognising the concealed paternal fretting beneath the taunting colour of his question, grasped his free hand in both of your own. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, Ronnie. He\u2019s just someone I met last night. He helped me after\u2026everything.\u201d</p><p>You felt your ears heat up at the recollection, and the coy expression on your face was not lost on your boss. \u201cOh right, okay. And what is it exactly he wants your help with?\u201d You clapped your hands around his in an \u2018I\u2019m done talking about this with you\u2019 kind of gesture and he saw your eyes dart up to the clock: almost seven fifty-five.</p><p>Before he could make any further comment, Ronnie\u2019s phone vibrated loudly across the bar top, signalling the arrival of his ride. He leant over the bar and ruffled your hair, causing a second tuft to rise up in sympathy on the other side of your head, and asked you to be careful. </p><p>As usual you promised you would be and vowed to call the police and him (in that order) should anything occur. Not like any of the guys who drank in here would ever allow anything to happen \u2013 though they would swear gruffly that was more for the bar\u2019s sake than for yours.

The head of the taller of the two came to just above Ronnie\u2019s jawline and the shorter one just about reached his shoulder.

He was walking towards the window past the table Taehyung had placed it on after Mark had tried to contact you as you slept, ironically so it wouldn&rsquo;t get lost. He saw the screen light up and reached out to hold it up for his friend. <b>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s phone is this?&rdquo;</b></p><p>Taehyung raised his eyes at the question and then leapt instantly and clumsily from his seat as his gaze fell on the unfamiliar handset. He snatched it from Jimin and gawked open-mouthed at the phone, seemingly a thousand thoughts jumping to his mind all at once. This was his way to find you, right?

He was walking towards the window past the table Taehyung had placed it on after Mark had tried to contact you as you slept, ironically so it wouldn&rsquo;t get lost. He saw the screen light up and reached out to hold it up for his friend. <b>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s phone is this?&rdquo;</b></p>\n<p>Taehyung raised his eyes at the question and then leapt instantly and clumsily from his seat as his gaze fell on the unfamiliar handset. He snatched it from Jimin and gawked open-mouthed at the phone, seemingly a thousand thoughts jumping to his mind all at once. This was his way to find you, right? But, what if it was Mark trying to call you again? The image of his face wasn&rsquo;t smirking back at him from the screen as it had before though, and this number didn&rsquo;t have any name or photo attached to it.</p>\n<p>Jimin stared dumbfounded at his inaction. &ldquo;<b>Are you going to answer it or stare at it?&rdquo;</b> but it was as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard the question, and he cradled it in his hand, gazing mutely at the illuminated display. <b>&ldquo;Taehyung-ah!&rdquo;</b> finally having enough he grabbed the phone back from him, startling him back in to reality, just in time for the phone to go dark as the caller gave up.</p>\n<p><b>&ldquo;What do I do, Jimin?&rdquo;</b></p>\n<p>He recognised the baffled expression on Taehyung&rsquo;s face, he had seen it often, his eyes widened to almost twice their normal size, his lips slightly pouted. <b>&ldquo;Well, you usually pick them up when they ring. There&rsquo;s a little green picture of a phone and you &ndash; &rdquo;</b></p>\n</p>",

I&rsquo;d love for one of them (preferably Hoseok) to be in a shitty relationship and have a bad breakup and for the other to be there for emotional support and to help him through it at the start. With time, they fall for each other, but not right after the breakup. (Maybe jungkook even had a crush on Hoseok before the breakup, but since Hoseok was dating he never acted on it.
