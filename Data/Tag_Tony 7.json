                "content": "<p>The five times Tony thought he&rsquo;d let Yinsen down and the one time he made him proud.</p><p>Gravel and rock fell as the cave settled from \nthe last explosion, but Tony didn&rsquo;t register it. His attention was on \nthe man laid out against the ammunition crates.</p><p>As he tried to \nurge the man to his feet, Yinsen confessed the truth, and for a moment, \nTony&rsquo;s grip on reality faltered. It had always been the other man&rsquo;s plan\n to meet his family again&mdash;except it wasn&rsquo;t in life Yinsen had planned on\n greeting them. It was in death.</p><p>He&rsquo;d planned to give his life to save Tony&rsquo;s from the start.</p><p>He\n found himself blinking, stunned at the notion someone would give \nthemselves to let him live. He wasn&rsquo;t the type of man who deserved that \nkind of sacrifice.</p><p>He was brought back from his thoughts by \nYinsen&rsquo;s catching breaths. He didn&rsquo;t need to be a doctor to know the \nother man was close to his last breath.</p><p>Tony had never watched \ndeath take someone so intimately before. His weapons had taken life, but\n that was different&mdash;this was someone he knew.</p><p>Part of him wanted \nto shy away, to close his eyes, but that seemed like dishonoring his \nsacrifice, so instead he watched as the doctor&rsquo;s eyes struggled to stay \nopen.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for saving me,&rdquo; Tony said before it was too late, knowing it would never be enough.</p><p>The\n other man drew a choking breath, eyes blinking open so his gaze could \nfall on him one last time. His voice was quiet as he spoke, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste\n it. Don&rsquo;t waste your life.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s mouth twitched but he gave a \nsmall nod, knowing that those words would never leave him. It was in \nthat moment his life changed forever.</p><p>He needed to make Yinsen proud. He needed to make his life worth it. No more wasting his chances. He had to be a better man.</p><p> 1.</p><p>Yinsen&rsquo;s words were never far from his thoughts&mdash;there in the background, reminding him of his pledge to do better, to be better.</p><p>He knew the moment he got home from the desert what he needed to be done first, shutting down weapons manufacturing.</p><p>No more blood on his hands. He already had enough of that.</p><p>It seemed like a tiny step, a mere drop in the bucket, but it was a start.</p><p>There\n was so much he wanted to do to honor the doctor&rsquo;s memory, but before he\n had the chance to begin, his heart was yanked from his chest.</p><p>He watched, paralyzed, as Obadiah walked from the room, reactor in hand, and a feeling of failure washed over him.</p><p>If Obadiah got away, if he died, then Yinsen sacrificed his life for nothing.</p><p>As he lay there struggling, his thoughts were on Yinsen and the promise he had made to himself that day.</p><p>\n &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t waste your life. \n</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t done enough yet. It couldn&rsquo;t be his time.</p><p>A fire \nbegan to burn inside him, and he pulled himself forward, clawing his way\n across the room to the workbench where the gift from Pepper sat. A \nglass case that contained his first heart&mdash;the heart Yinsen had helped \nput in his chest.</p><p>Smashing it be floor, he took it in hand and thought of the doctor as he placed it in his chest.</p><p>As life began to return to him, he vowed to do better</p><p>He&rsquo;d\n watched death take the last breath from Yinsen and tasted his own death\n twice. There was no telling how much time he had to become a better \nman. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to waste another day.</p><p>2.</p><p>Like a specter in the shadows, death seemed to follow Tony, brushing against his life.</p><p>Eight\n months had passed since the day he&rsquo;d been betrayed by Obadiah, since \nthe man he knew like family had torn the reactor from his chest.</p><p>Obadiah\n was dead and life moved on.

She rushed into Mr. Stark\u2019s office and once\nyou were on your own, you started looking at what was inside the box. To your\nsurprise, you found some of her stuff, and not only old papers that needed to\nbe recycled. Happy\u2019s words took a whole new meaning to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done, Tony!\u201d You could hear Pepper yelling\nfrom the inside of Mr. Stark\u2019s office. \u201cI\u2019m sick of worrying all day long about\nyou. I just can\u2019t do this anymore\u2026 You\u2019re gonna kill me one day, and if it\u2019s\nnot you, it\u2019s the people you fight against\u2026\u201d her voice softened and you\ncouldn\u2019t hear what else she was saying. </p><p>They must\u2019ve been having a big fight, and for\nTony\u2019s sake, you hoped that it was only that, and not that they broke up. Or\nworse, that she left the company. That would surely destroy him, and then you\u2019d\nbe hopeless trying to do your job, because he would most definitely fall into a\npit of despair and drink his life away. It used to be like that, before Pepper\nmade her way into his heart for good. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N), leave, run,\u201d she pressed her hands against\nthe glass surface of your desk. \u201cHe is not worth it.

The\npeople from the offices around you all came out because the noise was not\nnormal. The murmuring could be heard literally in every corner of the place,\nand it wasn\u2019t until Tony came out of his office that it quieted down. </p><p>He looked at you with wide eyes and his mouth\nslightly hanging open. He must\u2019ve been as shaken as you were, but he was the\none who got yelled at. You wanted to say something, but you were so terrified\nnow that you couldn\u2019t even think of a thing to make things better. He sighed\nheavily and turned on his heels to go back inside.</p><p>\n\nHis peace, and yours, was quaking.\n\n\n\n</p>",
