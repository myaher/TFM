That\u2019s a real classic.\u201d</p><p>Jester lets go of her elbow as if she\u2019s been burned. \u201cWhat\u2014what\nthe fuck, Beau, that\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You <i>know </i>I don\u2019t\nthink of you that way, you asshole.\u201d Her hurt quickly melts into indignation,\nanger. \u201cAnd don\u2019t pretend that you don\u2019t do the exact same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Beau says hotly, but all of a sudden she won\u2019t quite look Jester in the eye.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI know you got super happy that time Yasha asked me if you\nand I were, like, a <i>thing.</i>\u201d Jester\nfolds her arms, takes a step closer to her, but Beau doesn\u2019t flinch or back away.\n\u201cAnd then, you, you hug me more when Yasha is around, you\u2019re all cuddly with me\nand touch-y and nice all while you\u2019re trying so hard to flirt with <i>her</i>.\u201d</p><p>Now Beau flinches. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d she splutters, scrubs a hand\nacross her face. \u201cFuck you, Jester, that\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we? I thought\u2014best\nfriends. You said.\u201d</p><p>They both know she\u2019s dodging the point. Beau and Jester have\nalways been physically affectionate, but it\u2019s true that Beau is normally\nuncomfortable about initiating, instead letting Jester drag her into bear hugs\nand cuddle piles unless slaver kidnappers are involved. But when Yasha\u2019s there,\nwhen Yasha\u2019s watching, Beau suddenly has no problem draping an arm around\nJester\u2019s shoulders, dropping a kiss on her head when she stands to get more\nbeer, holding hands when they\u2019re strolling through the marketplace together.\nHer gaze trained on the aasimar\u2019s inscrutable face all the while.</p><p>\u201cWe are. We\u2019re friends.\u201d Jester\u2019s tone is steely, but there\u2019s\na tiny hitch of vulnerability there, too. They\u2019re standing so close together\nnow, eyes alight with anger, that Beau can count every freckle spilled across\nJester\u2019s face. \u201cBest friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest friends,\u201d Beau repeats, and Jester can see the muscle\nunder Beau\u2019s left eye twitching, just a little. She can see the faint, wobbly\ndiscoloration of a days-old bruise on her cheek, healed enough to be hard to\ndetect against the warm brown of her skin.</p><p>They hold their position, practically nose to nose, barely an\ninch gapping their bodies. Then finally Beau is the one who darts her gaze\naway, takes a small step back. Room to breathe.<i></i></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Jester, voice smaller now. \u201cSo, like, best\nfriends hug each other and cuddle and hold hands, and we do those things. And\nwe do those things in front of Fjord, and in front of Yasha, so I don\u2019t know\nwhy you got all\u2014freaked out this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou <i>kissed</i> me,\nJester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve kissed before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on the mouth. Not\u2014not like <i>that.</i>\u201d</p><p>(Jester yanking her in by the collar, mouths meeting\nclose-lipped and chaste, until Beau settles a gentle hand on the small of her\nback and Jester surges forward and suddenly there\u2019s tongue, and the faintest\nhint of sharp teeth. Then they pull apart, and Beau\u2019s looking at her but Jester\u2019s\nlooking at something above and behind Beau\u2019s shoulder, eyes blazing with a challenge. Her hands rest, still, on Beau\u2019s collarbone.)</p><p>They hold their stare-off for another moment before Jester\ndeflates. Neither of them are glaring, now, but they\u2019re standing farther away\nfrom each other than they were just a few moments ago, and an inexplicable part\nof Jester yearns to say, <i>come back. Come\nback to me.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI should have\nasked, Beau. That was a super shitty thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, Beau melts. \u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbles, awkward and\nuncertain now that they\u2019ve moved from the realm of argument to apology. \u201cBut,\nuh\u2014you\u2019re right. We wingman for each other. I made too big a deal out of it,\njust\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jester insists, and abruptly she\u2019s reaching out to\nsqueeze the monk\u2019s wrist in an iron grip. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. It was a big deal,\nand I shouldn\u2019t have done it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a point, though,\u201d Beau counters. \u201cFriends hug.\nFriends even kiss. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She eyes her cautiously. Doesn\u2019t pull\nher arm away. \u201cBecause we\u2019re friends. Right, Jes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d Jester repeats. The word hangs taut in the air\nbetween them. She can feel Beau\u2019s rapid heartbeat pulse through the vein of her\nwrist. \u201cFriends,\u201d she says again. \u201cBut I think it matters, still, a little. A\nlot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Beau. Jester\u2019s grip is starting to hurt, almost.</p><p>They hold their breath. Neither move. Caught in stasis.</p><p>Beau settles a gentle hand on the small of Jester\u2019s back.</p>",

But when Yasha\u2019s there,\nwhen Yasha\u2019s watching, Beau suddenly has no problem draping an arm around\nJester\u2019s shoulders, dropping a kiss on her head when she stands to get more\nbeer, holding hands when they\u2019re strolling through the marketplace together.\nHer gaze trained on the aasimar\u2019s inscrutable face all the while.</p><p>\u201cWe are.

She can see the faint, wobbly\ndiscoloration of a days-old bruise on her cheek, healed enough to be hard to\ndetect against the warm brown of her skin.</p><p>They hold their position, practically nose to nose, barely an\ninch gapping their bodies. Then finally Beau is the one who darts her gaze\naway, takes a small step back. Room to breathe.<i></i></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Jester, voice smaller now. \u201cSo, like, best\nfriends hug each other and cuddle and hold hands, and we do those things. And\nwe do those things in front of Fjord, and in front of Yasha, so I don\u2019t know\nwhy you got all\u2014freaked out this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou <i>kissed</i> me,\nJester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve kissed before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on the mouth.

Then they pull apart, and Beau\u2019s looking at her but Jester\u2019s\nlooking at something above and behind Beau\u2019s shoulder, eyes blazing with a challenge. Her hands rest, still, on Beau\u2019s collarbone.)</p><p>They hold their stare-off for another moment before Jester\ndeflates. Neither of them are glaring, now, but they\u2019re standing farther away\nfrom each other than they were just a few moments ago, and an inexplicable part\nof Jester yearns to say, <i>come back. Come\nback to me.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI should have\nasked, Beau. That was a super shitty thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, Beau melts. \u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbles, awkward and\nuncertain now that they\u2019ve moved from the realm of argument to apology. \u201cBut,\nuh\u2014you\u2019re right.

I made too big a deal out of it,\njust\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jester insists, and abruptly she\u2019s reaching out to\nsqueeze the monk\u2019s wrist in an iron grip. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. It was a big deal,\nand I shouldn\u2019t have done it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a point, though,\u201d Beau counters. \u201cFriends hug.\nFriends even kiss. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She eyes her cautiously. Doesn\u2019t pull\nher arm away. \u201cBecause we\u2019re friends. Right, Jes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d Jester repeats.

She can feel Beau\u2019s rapid heartbeat pulse through the vein of her\nwrist. \u201cFriends,\u201d she says again. \u201cBut I think it matters, still, a little. A\nlot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Beau. Jester\u2019s grip is starting to hurt, almost.</p><p>They hold their breath. Neither move.
