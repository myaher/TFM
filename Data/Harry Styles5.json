        "answer": "<p>Oooh GIRL \ud83d\udc4c</p><p>It was the 16 hour plane ride home that did it for you. Harry was looking so good and maybe you thought it was because you were bored and that&rsquo;s why you were feeling the wetness spread between your thighs. His hair was in a tiny pony tail on the top of his head and he had the perfect amount of stubble. His eyes were glued to his book as his legs touched yours. </p><p>&ldquo; Harry&rdquo; you quietly whispered in his ear. </p><p>&ldquo; What love? &rdquo; He asked, not even looking up from his book. </p><p>&ldquo; Nothing, nevermind &rdquo; you shrugged. </p><p>You slowly moved your hand to his thigh and started rubbing. His eyes peaked up at you and you gave him a small smile. </p><p>&ldquo; What are you doing love&rdquo; he asked, setting the book to the side. You didn&rsquo;t answer, instead you slowly rid you hand higher up and before you could get to his goods he grabbed your hand. </p><p>&ldquo; Are you being a bad girl? I asked you a question&rdquo; His tone was striked. </p><p>&ldquo; I want you, Daddy. &rdquo; </p><p>You unbuckled your seatbelt and made your way to the bathroom. Today was the lucky day, you hadn&rsquo;t worn panties because none of them were clean. </p><p>A couple minutes later a small knock on the door interrupted your thoughts and Soon Harry made his way in the bathroom. The small stall made you a little anxious. </p><p>&ldquo; Now you bad girl, let&rsquo;s finish what you started shall we. &rdquo; His hands made his way up your shorts and slowly he pulled them down. </p><p>&ldquo; Let me do something for you first&rdquo; you begged. </p><p>&ldquo; Alright get to it&rdquo; he laughed. </p><p>Your hands fumbled with the botons on his pants and you soon disgarded them along with his boxers. </p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s not gonna suck itself, pretty girl&rdquo; his words killed you, in a good way. </p><p>You grabbed his length and started kissing the head, it was red and full of pre cum. His wimperes made you even hornier. </p><p>You started pumping him faster and faster, you took him in your mouth a few times and that&rsquo;s what did it for him, your soft pink lips wrapped around his hard thick cock and soon he shot his cum in your face. </p><p>&ldquo; alright my turn, we&rsquo;ve been in here to long. They&rsquo;ll get suspicious. &rdquo; </p><p>He lifted you up on the tiny counter, his hands wrapped around your thighs. He pumped himself a couple times before positioning himself by your entrance and slowly he pushed himself in.
