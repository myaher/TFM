Hope you enjoy my Christmas mini-series!</b></p><hr><p><a href=\"http://daniactuallysnuffledthatpopcorn.tumblr.com/post/181326626495/home-for-christmas-part-2-of-4\" target=\"_blank\">part two &ndash;&gt;</a></p><hr><p>Schools looked weird in the evening.</p><p>The hallways were dark, lit up only by Ms Collins\u2019\nflashlight as she led the group of teenagers to her classroom. On top of it\nbeing close to seven pm, it was also December 23, the day before Christmas Eve.\nTwenty-two teenagers had dragged themselves out of their warm and comfortable\nhouse for the night to go watch some ballet performance of the Nutcracker with\ntheir drama teacher; something they\u2019d signed up for back in September when it\nwas warm out and they were optimistic and excited for Christmas. </p><p>At the back of the line Dan Howell was looking at Snapchats\nof a party he\u2019d been invited to that night. Eleanor Prince was dragging him\nalong by his arm, occasionally looking over his shoulder at his phone screen.\n\u201cHold up, is that Sophie? She said she couldn\u2019t come to the Nutcracker because\nshe\u2019s sick. The bitch.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cNo offense, but if my mum hadn\u2019t literally walked us to the\ndoors I would have done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too late to say I\u2019m sick now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me here alone, El. Tough it out.\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t need to look over to her to know she was rolling her eyes at him.</p><p>At the end of the hallway the Emergency Exit sign lit up\ngreen and dimly illuminated the door below it. They took a left into a\nclassroom just before it, piling onto tables and chatting quietly. The dark and\nsilent school demanded a sort of respect that no one could explain. It felt\nalmost ominous. Ms Collins had apparently not received this memo, as she\nslammed the door so hard every student in the room flinched. \u201cBefore we go to\nthe show, I\u2019d like to discuss the themes and story of the Nutcracker with you\nguys. Have any of you been to a performance before?\u201d</p><p>If teenagers weren\u2019t eager to speak up during actual\nclasses, they sure as hell weren\u2019t on Christmas break. Twenty-two sets of eyes\nwandered purposelessly around the room, avoiding Ms Collins\u2019 stare at every\ncost. \u201cDaniel?\u201d She tried.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He responded curtly.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what it might be about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She moved on to the next person with a hint of desperation,\n\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>With his hand shielding the screen from being spotted by the\nteacher Dan showed Eleanor a string of pictures one of their friends had sent\nhim. From their group, the two of them were the only ones who\u2019d been dumb enough\nto sign up for the trip. Eleanor had even been mildly excited at first,\ncarrying her enthusiasm over to Dan who\u2019d agreed to sign up with her. She was a\nfervent hip-hop dancer and had thought that watching a performance of a\ndifferent type of dance would be cool. That was, however, before she\u2019d learnt\nthat Tia Samson was throwing a party for the entirety of their college that\nexact night. Tia Samson, whose parents owned a record company and who lived in\na penthouse in St John\u2019s Wood. Whom Eleanor had been trying desperately to\nbefriend all year. </p><p>Unfortunately, Eleanor\u2019s parents had entrusted her to the\ncare of Dan\u2019s mum, who had insisted on driving them and even walking them to\nthe building to \u2018make sure they would get inside safe\u2019 because it was dark and\nshe was overprotective. </p><p>In the twenty-five minutes it took Ms Collins to get all the\nanswers she wanted from her unwilling students Dan caught up with exactly what\nhad happened at the party so far. It had started around six with a large pizza\nbuffet orchestrated by the Samsons\u2019 \u2018help\u2019 -which was another word for\n\u2018butler\u2019, really- and as they were finishing up the pizzas Tia was letting\npeople add songs to the playlist for the night and ice cream was being brought\nout. Dan and Eleanor had quickly eaten some pasta before leaving for school and\nreally, life was unfair. </p><p>By the time the group made their way back to the doors\nthrough the dark hallways of Quenten Secondary School Dan was stuffing a Mars\nbar in his mouth that he\u2019d found in his pocket. A sort of silent protest\nagainst Tia\u2019s dumb party and her dumb pizza. </p><p>The school hadn\u2019t even gotten them a bus or anything; they\nhad to walk fifteen minutes to the theatre in the freezing cold. Eleanor hopped\nfrom one leg to the other as they waited for Ms Collins to lock the gates\nbehind them. </p><p>At the front of the group were a couple of kids who seemed\ngenuinely excited to be going to the ballet performance, but most them were\njust angry with themselves for signing up for the thing in the first place.\nThey trotted along the pavement in the dark, hugging themselves for warmth or\nshoving their hands as deep into their pockets as they would go.</p><p>Dan was grumbling to himself but Eleanor paid him no mind.\nShe pulled her woolly hat over her ears and quietly followed the crowd. </p><p>The theatre was beautifully decorated with colourful fairy\nlights and a huge Christmas tree in the front lobby. Dan distractedly ran his\nfingers over the wreath on the front desk while they were being briefed on\nproper behaviour during the show. He was going through the motions without\nlistening- following his classmates to the cloakroom, hanging up his coat, and\nwandering after them to their seats. </p><p>He sensed that now that they were inside and warm Eleanor\nwas starting to get excited again. She upright, slightly leaning over the chair\nin front of her to get a better view of the stage. Dan himself was slouched in\nhis chair, eyes still trained on his phone. \u201cOkay, this is kind of cool.\u201d\nEleanor said after a few minutes, grabbing Dan\u2019s arm and shaking him slightly.\n\u201cPut your phone away, it\u2019ll start soon.\u201d</p><p>He groaned but did as she asked. Truth be told, apart from\nthe fact that it was making him miss Tia Samson\u2019s party, Dan didn\u2019t actually\nhate being there that much. He would never admit that much though, preferring\nto keep his image intact. </p><p>The lights went down. The bottom left of the curtain moved\nslightly, catching Dan\u2019s eye and keeping his gaze there as the stage became\nvisible and the dancers appeared. A boy about his own age with dark hair and a\nbeautiful red blazer stood in the place that had caught Dan\u2019s attention. Dan\nwatched him as he danced for a little while before letting his gaze shift to\nthe other dancers. He didn\u2019t actually know the story of the Nutcracker and\nmaybe he should\u2019ve listened to Ms Collins\u2019 explanation, but it was a little\nlate for that now. \u00a0</p><p>The performance was beautiful, but Dan kept that to himself.\nEleanor was clearly enjoying it too, keeping a tight grasp on his arm and\nshaking him every time one of the dancers did a particularly difficult move.\nThe fact that this was making her so happy was in turn making Dan happy. He\ngrinned and shook his head as she squealed quietly, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d</p><p>When the break started and the lights went on Dan was almost\ndisappointed. Almost. He dug his phone out of his pocket and caught up with the\nparty on snapchat. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a drink. Do you want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a coke please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled his legs under his chair so Eleanor could shuffle\npast him, and he quickly glanced at their classmates around him before\nreturning to his screen. They all seemed to have gotten over their initial\nannoyance with being there, as he and Eleanor had. Ms Collins was engaging a\ncouple of students in a conversation, and for once her subjects did not seem to\nbe completely loathing their existence in that moment.</p><p>At Tia\u2019s party the karaoke machine had been broken out and\nDan watched a shaky recording of his friend Alex singing Africa by Toto. He was\nholding a beer bottle and clearly already tipsy. By the time Dan would be home\nfrom the ballet performance he might just have enough time to get changed and\nhead over there too. He\u2019d missed the dinner and ice cream, but he wasn\u2019t too\nlate to get drunk and sing karaoke. </p><p>Eleanor returned after ten minutes with two bottles of coke\nand a mischievous grin plastered on her face. Dan couldn\u2019t help but raise his\neyebrow at her, \u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got invited to a party by one of the cute dancers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA party? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. They\u2019re having an afterparty at their hotel. Want\nto come?\u201d</p><p>Dan hesitated, glancing back at his phone screen where a new\nsnap from Sophie had just come in. A Tia Samson party was epic, but he\u2019d never\nbeen to a hotel party before, and this might be the only chance he\u2019d get. Plus,\nthere\u2019d be loads of cute girls. Worth it. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Phil at the backdoors about an hour after the\nshow, so that gives us enough time to go home and change. I could even do some\neyeliner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, huh?\u201d Dan laughed, he pulled a face at her and she\nstuck out her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because I\u2019m getting laid tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hook up with someone.\u201d Dan huffed. </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Eleanor said, theatrically flipping her hair over\nher shoulder and taking a sip of her coke.</p><p>\u201cShut up, you\u2019re such a bully.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan\u2019s mum picked the two of them back up after the show. At\nthe theatre, thank God, so they didn\u2019t have to walk the fifteen minutes back to\nschool in the freezing cold. </p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d She asked as they got in the car.</p><p>\u201cSo good, Mrs Howell,\u201d Eleanor beamed, \u201cWe\u2019ve been invited\nto go hang out with the dancers for a bit actually. They\u2019re really lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That sounds fun. Will there be alcohol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of the dancers are of age so they might be\ndrinking, but we won\u2019t, of course.\u201d</p><p>Mrs Howell nodded contently. She had a sweet spot for\nEleanor, and the teenagers loved to use that to their advantage. By the time\nthey got home she had even agreed to pay for an Uber. </p><p>Eleanor slept over so often that she kept a little\ncollection of makeup and clothes in the bottom drawer of Dan\u2019s wardrobe. She\nwas the only girl Dan\u2019s parents would let sleep in his room with him, and\nalthough they probably hoped the two of them would end up together, Dan and\nEleanor shuddered at the thought. They had been friends for as long as Dan\ncould remember and kissing her would be like making out with his twin. </p><p>She sat at his desk as she applied a new layer of mascara.\nDan, long done putting on a clean shirt and running a hand through his hair,\nwas seated on the table beside her makeup, feet propped up on the chair. \u201cWhat\ntime are you coming over tomorrow?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cBefore lunch.\u201d She responded. She blinked a few times and\nheld the pocket mirror closer to her eye. \u201cIt\u2019s not Christmas Eve if I miss\nyour mum\u2019s pigs in blankets.\u201d</p><p>On the day of Christmas Eve Eleanor always came over to eat\npigs in blankets and make Christmas ornaments with Dan and his mum. They\u2019d\nstarted the tradition back when doing crafts with your mum was still cool, but\nby the time they\u2019d grown out of crafts in general, they had also grown attached\nto their tradition. And so the Howells\u2019 tree was filled with homemade\nornaments, and the mantle over the fireplace featured a line-up of clay\nfigurines. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Just after eleven the Uber dropped them off at the hotel.\nOne of the dancers, Mia Bright picked them up in the lobby and took them\nupstairs to the hallway all their rooms were on. The main party was taking\nplace in the room of the boy who danced the part of the Nutcracker and one of\nthe background dancers. At first glance it looked pretty chilled; teens\nlounging around with drinks and some music playing in the background, but on\ntop of the mini fridge were three bottles of liquor. The night was young and\nthe cards were open.</p><p>Eleanor sat down on the floor with some boys and was\nimmediately handed a drink. Just as Dan was looking around the room to see\nwhere the most girls were gathered, he was invited to join the people on the\nbed. Half boys, half girls. Could be worse. He picked up a beer and leaned back\nagainst the headboard.</p><p>He chatted to them for a while, complimenting them on their\nperformance and asking about their tour. One of the girls did some dance moves\nfor him, putting on a show and obviously flirting. She was pretty, with long\nblonde hair and a lowcut top, and Dan didn\u2019t mind in the slightest. </p><p>The emptier the bottles of liquor got, the looser the group.\nSome other people squeezed themselves between the teens on the bed and they\nstarted playing a half-hearted game of Truth or Dare. Dan was tipsy, grinning\nwidely as two girls kissed each other on a dare. The boys cheered, apart from\none who shushed them and told the boy next to Dan, \u201cI dare you to kiss him.\u201d He\npointed at Dan, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d The boy turned to him, \u201cBut I\u2019m a gentleman. I don\u2019t\nkiss people whose names I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dan. My name is Phil.\u201d</p><p>For a second Dan thought about the fact that this boy in\nfront of him was probably the one Eleanor had her eye on. Then his thoughts\nwere interrupted by his lips. </p><p>Phil put his hand on the back of Dan\u2019s neck and pulled him\nin. He kept him close for a good few seconds, and when they finally pulled\napart they grinned at each other. Kissing boys was very different from kissing\ngirls, but not in a bad way. Over Phil\u2019s shoulder Dan saw Eleanor watching\nthem. He mouthed a \u2018sorry\u2019 at her, but as a response she pointed to the boy\nnext to her and shrugged. She\u2019d moved on.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol coursing through his veins, but for\nthe next fifteen minutes Dan was awfully aware of the fact that his leg was\ntouching Phil\u2019s. He kept glancing over to him, and his dumb intoxicated brain\nwas noticing things he usually only noticed in girls. Like the wrinkles by his\neyes when he laughed, and the way he bit the inside of his cheek\nabsentmindedly. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of booze.\u201d A bottle was chucked at the bed and\nsome of the teenagers ducked to dodge it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more in mine and Cal\u2019s room. Dan and I will go get\nit.\u201d Phil didn\u2019t give Dan the chance to speak for himself, simply getting off\nthe bed and expecting him to follow. He did.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Phil pulled a keycard out of his pocket and led\nthem into a room.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man.\u201d</p><p>The room was messy, clothes strewn about the place and an\nopen suitcase lying on one of the beds. </p><p>\u201cYou into guys?\u201d</p><p>It was a sudden question to which the answer should\u2019ve been\na decisive \u2018no\u2019, but Dan found himself shrugging, not able to get the negation\nover his lips after he\u2019d just had those thoughts about this boy\u2019s features. </p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Phil took some bottles out from under a bed and put\nthem on top of the duvet. \u201cYou, included.\u201d</p><p>Dan was flustered but didn\u2019t let it show, \u201cI tend to have\nthat kind of effect on people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you like guys, are you?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug.</p><p>\u201cWant to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose that wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Before he knew it he was backed against the bathroom door\nwith hands on his waist and Phil\u2019s forehead pressed against his own. \u201cI feel\nlike you might be.\u201d Phil said softly, pushing his hips forward.</p><p>Dan\u2019s breath caught in his throat. \u201cConvince me.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed him. Messily and aggressively, with Dan\nstruggling to keep up. </p><p>Fingers teased at the hem of his jumper and caught bits of\nexposed skin here and there. Goosebumps rose up on his abdomen as a familiar\nwarmth tugged at the bottom of his stomach. He finally regathered his own agency,\nlifting his hands and experimentally putting them on Phil\u2019s shoulders first. He\nwasn\u2019t sure where you were supposed to touch a boy when kissing them. Girls\nwere easy: you just touched their boobs. He racked his brain in an attempt to\nremember where girls usually touched him, and eventually just settled for\nrunning his hands down from Phil\u2019s shoulders to his chest, and then down to his\nbelly. He was toned, a dancer\u2019s body, muscles hard under Dan\u2019s fingertips. </p><p>Phil easily took control over him. He\u2019d never expected that\nhe would be so eager to give it up, especially to another boy. </p><p>There was a knock on the door that scared them both out of\ntheir excited daze. Phil backed away, straightening his shirt before checking\nthe peephole, \u201cFriends.\u201d He said. </p><p>Dan picked up the bottles as the other opened the door. A\nfew of the dancers tumbled into the room, grumbling about the lack of alcohol\nin the party room. \u201cSeriously, what\u2019s taking you guys so long?\u201d</p><p>But the girl at the back of the group grinned and winked knowingly\nat Dan when he handed her the liquor. His cheeks turned pink, quickly turning\naway. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming with us?\u201d A boy asked. </p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Phil said, a mischievous smile decorating his\npretty features. He closed the door behind his friends and turned back to Dan,\n\u201cSo, where were we?\u201d</p><p>The interruption had given Dan time to think. A moment for\nhis brain to catch up with what his body had been doing. \u201cEh, maybe we should\nget back to the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Phil didn\u2019t seem disappointed as much as genuinely\nsurprised.</p><p>Dan tugged at the hem of his jumper, \u201cThey\u2019ll think we\nhooked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe can go back if you want. I\u2019ll deny anything happened\nbetween us.\u201d</p><p>It was the Out Dan thought he wanted, but now that it was on\nthe table it didn\u2019t feel right. He glanced at the door. He could leave if he\nwanted; Phil wasn\u2019t keeping him here. But passing up the opportunity to mess\naround with this hot person who was literally offering himself to him, even\nthough that hot person was a guy, felt like a wholly irresponsible decision.\nAnd so he made a dismissive gesture with his hand and said, \u201cWell, they already\nthink we hooked up. Might as well actually do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? We don\u2019t have to do anything if you don\u2019t\nwant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen yourself? Rejecting you would be a crime.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned, \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself.\u201d He stepped\ncloser and reached up, fingers brushing the side of Dan\u2019s neck. That alone was\nenough to make Dan feel like the whole interruption had never happened. He was\nas wound up and desperate as he\u2019d been just a few minutes before, and he\ngrabbed Phil\u2019s hips and pulled him close as he started kissing him. </p><p>This time it didn\u2019t take long for them to stumble towards\nthe bed. Dan fell onto his back, Phil leaning over him on his elbows. They were\nboth more confident now, and Dan slipped his hands under Phil\u2019s shirt without\nhesitating. Guys\u2019 bodies were so different from girls\u2019 bodies and his fingers\nexplored the new landscape. Phil dropped his hips, his lower body now fully leaning\non Dan\u2019s, and the latter could feel his cock twitch against his own through\ntheir jeans. A shiver went up his spine as he pulled him closer. </p><p>Phil rolled off him, and Dan was about to protest when the\nother\u2019s hands moved to his jeans and made quick work of his belt. They were\nboth impatient, pulling at each other\u2019s clothes until they decided to just do\nit themselves. Dan kicked off his jeans and pulled his shirt over his head.\nWhen he looked back to Phil the latter had just pulled a bottle of lube out of\none of the suitcases on the floor. \u201cMove to that bed,\u201d he instructed, \u201cmaking\nout on Ryan\u2019s bed is something, but taking off trousers is a whole other\nthing.\u201d</p><p>They kissed for a few seconds but then Phil was tired of\nwaiting and wrapped his fingers around Dan\u2019s cock. Dan shivered and followed\nhis lead after a moment. He may not know where to put his hands on a boy\u2019s\ntorso, but he definitely knew what to do with his hands near a penis. He moved\nslowly, slower than he would for himself, and softly brushed his thumb over the\ntip. Phil made a sound that echoed through Dan\u2019s body and made his abdomen\ntighten. </p><p>Their foreheads touched, breaths mixing together in the air\nbetween them as they touched each other. Both were too out of breath to kiss,\nbut that didn\u2019t stop them from trying a few times, exchanging sloppy kisses and\nmoaning into them. </p><p>When Dan\u2019s hand started stuttering, Phil pushed him onto his\nback and kissed his way down the boy\u2019s torso as he sped up his hand. </p><p>Dan\u2019s head fell back as he came onto his own stomach,\npanting and grabbing at the sheets. Phil worked him through it until the boy\nunder him relaxed. He took a second to collect himself, then turned his\nattention back to Phil.</p><p>He made quick work of him, leaning over him and moving fast.\nPhil\u2019s hands traced the muscles on his back, and when he got close his nails\ndug into Dan\u2019s skin. Dan didn\u2019t mind, biting his lip and resting his forehead\nin the nook of Phil\u2019s shoulder. He didn\u2019t raise his head until Phil came, and\nhe watched the pleasure wash over him, his jaw slacking and eyes closing. </p><p>Dan rolled off him and for a few minutes they quietly lied\non their backs next to each other. </p><p>\u201cThat was good.\u201d Dan broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil laughed. He reached out and brushed the back of\nDan\u2019s hand with his fingertips. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe I\u2019m kind of into guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m irresistible.\u201d Phil said.</p><p>They pushed themselves up off the bed and headed into the\nbathroom to clean themselves up. They moved slowly, lazily splashing water on\nthemselves and brushing arms whenever they moved by each other. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>When they walked back into the main party room all eyes were\non them, knowing looks being cast their way. Eleanor, now sat on the bed with\nsome girls, grinned at Dan, who returned her grin but averted his gaze quickly.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you have a good night, Lester?\u201d One of the boys shouted.\nSome others cheered and Dan felt his cheeks go red.</p><p>\u201cYeah man, when\u2019s the last time you had a night as fun as\nmine?\u201d</p><p>That shut him right up. There was laughter around the room as\neverything settled down. Dan sat with Eleanor, somehow comforted by her\nfamiliarity. He felt a bit uneasy with the notion that everyone in the room\nknew that he\u2019d just messed around with another guy, even though no one really\nseemed to care that much. Not even Eleanor, surprisingly.</p><p>When he was handed some sort of vodka-and-coke-combination\nhe loosened up, downing it quickly and getting another glass right after. Who\neven cared about whom he had sex with?</p><p>He fell asleep on the bathroom floor at four thirty in the\nmorning.</p>",

Eleanor Prince was dragging him\nalong by his arm, occasionally looking over his shoulder at his phone screen.\n\u201cHold up, is that Sophie? She said she couldn\u2019t come to the Nutcracker because\nshe\u2019s sick. The bitch.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cNo offense, but if my mum hadn\u2019t literally walked us to the\ndoors I would have done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too late to say I\u2019m sick now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me here alone, El. Tough it out.\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t need to look over to her to know she was rolling her eyes at him.</p><p>At the end of the hallway the Emergency Exit sign lit up\ngreen and dimly illuminated the door below it. They took a left into a\nclassroom just before it, piling onto tables and chatting quietly. The dark and\nsilent school demanded a sort of respect that no one could explain. It felt\nalmost ominous. Ms Collins had apparently not received this memo, as she\nslammed the door so hard every student in the room flinched. \u201cBefore we go to\nthe show, I\u2019d like to discuss the themes and story of the Nutcracker with you\nguys. Have any of you been to a performance before?\u201d</p><p>If teenagers weren\u2019t eager to speak up during actual\nclasses, they sure as hell weren\u2019t on Christmas break. Twenty-two sets of eyes\nwandered purposelessly around the room, avoiding Ms Collins\u2019 stare at every\ncost. \u201cDaniel?\u201d She tried.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He responded curtly.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what it might be about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She moved on to the next person with a hint of desperation,\n\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>With his hand shielding the screen from being spotted by the\nteacher Dan showed Eleanor a string of pictures one of their friends had sent\nhim. From their group, the two of them were the only ones who\u2019d been dumb enough\nto sign up for the trip. Eleanor had even been mildly excited at first,\ncarrying her enthusiasm over to Dan who\u2019d agreed to sign up with her. She was a\nfervent hip-hop dancer and had thought that watching a performance of a\ndifferent type of dance would be cool. That was, however, before she\u2019d learnt\nthat Tia Samson was throwing a party for the entirety of their college that\nexact night. Tia Samson, whose parents owned a record company and who lived in\na penthouse in St John\u2019s Wood. Whom Eleanor had been trying desperately to\nbefriend all year. </p><p>Unfortunately, Eleanor\u2019s parents had entrusted her to the\ncare of Dan\u2019s mum, who had insisted on driving them and even walking them to\nthe building to \u2018make sure they would get inside safe\u2019 because it was dark and\nshe was overprotective. </p><p>In the twenty-five minutes it took Ms Collins to get all the\nanswers she wanted from her unwilling students Dan caught up with exactly what\nhad happened at the party so far. It had started around six with a large pizza\nbuffet orchestrated by the Samsons\u2019 \u2018help\u2019 -which was another word for\n\u2018butler\u2019, really- and as they were finishing up the pizzas Tia was letting\npeople add songs to the playlist for the night and ice cream was being brought\nout. Dan and Eleanor had quickly eaten some pasta before leaving for school and\nreally, life was unfair. </p><p>By the time the group made their way back to the doors\nthrough the dark hallways of Quenten Secondary School Dan was stuffing a Mars\nbar in his mouth that he\u2019d found in his pocket. A sort of silent protest\nagainst Tia\u2019s dumb party and her dumb pizza. </p><p>The school hadn\u2019t even gotten them a bus or anything; they\nhad to walk fifteen minutes to the theatre in the freezing cold. Eleanor hopped\nfrom one leg to the other as they waited for Ms Collins to lock the gates\nbehind them. </p><p>At the front of the group were a couple of kids who seemed\ngenuinely excited to be going to the ballet performance, but most them were\njust angry with themselves for signing up for the thing in the first place.\nThey trotted along the pavement in the dark, hugging themselves for warmth or\nshoving their hands as deep into their pockets as they would go.</p><p>Dan was grumbling to himself but Eleanor paid him no mind.\nShe pulled her woolly hat over her ears and quietly followed the crowd. </p><p>The theatre was beautifully decorated with colourful fairy\nlights and a huge Christmas tree in the front lobby. Dan distractedly ran his\nfingers over the wreath on the front desk while they were being briefed on\nproper behaviour during the show. He was going through the motions without\nlistening- following his classmates to the cloakroom, hanging up his coat, and\nwandering after them to their seats. </p><p>He sensed that now that they were inside and warm Eleanor\nwas starting to get excited again. She upright, slightly leaning over the chair\nin front of her to get a better view of the stage. Dan himself was slouched in\nhis chair, eyes still trained on his phone. \u201cOkay, this is kind of cool.\u201d\nEleanor said after a few minutes, grabbing Dan\u2019s arm and shaking him slightly.\n\u201cPut your phone away, it\u2019ll start soon.\u201d</p><p>He groaned but did as she asked. Truth be told, apart from\nthe fact that it was making him miss Tia Samson\u2019s party, Dan didn\u2019t actually\nhate being there that much. He would never admit that much though, preferring\nto keep his image intact. </p><p>The lights went down. The bottom left of the curtain moved\nslightly, catching Dan\u2019s eye and keeping his gaze there as the stage became\nvisible and the dancers appeared. A boy about his own age with dark hair and a\nbeautiful red blazer stood in the place that had caught Dan\u2019s attention. Dan\nwatched him as he danced for a little while before letting his gaze shift to\nthe other dancers. He didn\u2019t actually know the story of the Nutcracker and\nmaybe he should\u2019ve listened to Ms Collins\u2019 explanation, but it was a little\nlate for that now. \u00a0</p><p>The performance was beautiful, but Dan kept that to himself.\nEleanor was clearly enjoying it too, keeping a tight grasp on his arm and\nshaking him every time one of the dancers did a particularly difficult move.\nThe fact that this was making her so happy was in turn making Dan happy. He\ngrinned and shook his head as she squealed quietly, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d</p><p>When the break started and the lights went on Dan was almost\ndisappointed. Almost. He dug his phone out of his pocket and caught up with the\nparty on snapchat. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a drink. Do you want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a coke please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled his legs under his chair so Eleanor could shuffle\npast him, and he quickly glanced at their classmates around him before\nreturning to his screen. They all seemed to have gotten over their initial\nannoyance with being there, as he and Eleanor had. Ms Collins was engaging a\ncouple of students in a conversation, and for once her subjects did not seem to\nbe completely loathing their existence in that moment.</p><p>At Tia\u2019s party the karaoke machine had been broken out and\nDan watched a shaky recording of his friend Alex singing Africa by Toto. He was\nholding a beer bottle and clearly already tipsy. By the time Dan would be home\nfrom the ballet performance he might just have enough time to get changed and\nhead over there too. He\u2019d missed the dinner and ice cream, but he wasn\u2019t too\nlate to get drunk and sing karaoke. </p><p>Eleanor returned after ten minutes with two bottles of coke\nand a mischievous grin plastered on her face. Dan couldn\u2019t help but raise his\neyebrow at her, \u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got invited to a party by one of the cute dancers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA party? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. They\u2019re having an afterparty at their hotel. Want\nto come?\u201d</p><p>Dan hesitated, glancing back at his phone screen where a new\nsnap from Sophie had just come in. A Tia Samson party was epic, but he\u2019d never\nbeen to a hotel party before, and this might be the only chance he\u2019d get. Plus,\nthere\u2019d be loads of cute girls. Worth it. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Phil at the backdoors about an hour after the\nshow, so that gives us enough time to go home and change. I could even do some\neyeliner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, huh?\u201d Dan laughed, he pulled a face at her and she\nstuck out her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because I\u2019m getting laid tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hook up with someone.\u201d Dan huffed. </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Eleanor said, theatrically flipping her hair over\nher shoulder and taking a sip of her coke.</p><p>\u201cShut up, you\u2019re such a bully.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan\u2019s mum picked the two of them back up after the show. At\nthe theatre, thank God, so they didn\u2019t have to walk the fifteen minutes back to\nschool in the freezing cold. </p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d She asked as they got in the car.</p><p>\u201cSo good, Mrs Howell,\u201d Eleanor beamed, \u201cWe\u2019ve been invited\nto go hang out with the dancers for a bit actually. They\u2019re really lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That sounds fun. Will there be alcohol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of the dancers are of age so they might be\ndrinking, but we won\u2019t, of course.\u201d</p><p>Mrs Howell nodded contently. She had a sweet spot for\nEleanor, and the teenagers loved to use that to their advantage. By the time\nthey got home she had even agreed to pay for an Uber. </p><p>Eleanor slept over so often that she kept a little\ncollection of makeup and clothes in the bottom drawer of Dan\u2019s wardrobe. She\nwas the only girl Dan\u2019s parents would let sleep in his room with him, and\nalthough they probably hoped the two of them would end up together, Dan and\nEleanor shuddered at the thought. They had been friends for as long as Dan\ncould remember and kissing her would be like making out with his twin. </p><p>She sat at his desk as she applied a new layer of mascara.\nDan, long done putting on a clean shirt and running a hand through his hair,\nwas seated on the table beside her makeup, feet propped up on the chair. \u201cWhat\ntime are you coming over tomorrow?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cBefore lunch.\u201d She responded. She blinked a few times and\nheld the pocket mirror closer to her eye. \u201cIt\u2019s not Christmas Eve if I miss\nyour mum\u2019s pigs in blankets.\u201d</p><p>On the day of Christmas Eve Eleanor always came over to eat\npigs in blankets and make Christmas ornaments with Dan and his mum. They\u2019d\nstarted the tradition back when doing crafts with your mum was still cool, but\nby the time they\u2019d grown out of crafts in general, they had also grown attached\nto their tradition. And so the Howells\u2019 tree was filled with homemade\nornaments, and the mantle over the fireplace featured a line-up of clay\nfigurines. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>Just after eleven the Uber dropped them off at the hotel.\nOne of the dancers, Mia Bright picked them up in the lobby and took them\nupstairs to the hallway all their rooms were on. The main party was taking\nplace in the room of the boy who danced the part of the Nutcracker and one of\nthe background dancers. At first glance it looked pretty chilled; teens\nlounging around with drinks and some music playing in the background, but on\ntop of the mini fridge were three bottles of liquor. The night was young and\nthe cards were open.</p><p>Eleanor sat down on the floor with some boys and was\nimmediately handed a drink. Just as Dan was looking around the room to see\nwhere the most girls were gathered, he was invited to join the people on the\nbed. Half boys, half girls. Could be worse. He picked up a beer and leaned back\nagainst the headboard.</p><p>He chatted to them for a while, complimenting them on their\nperformance and asking about their tour. One of the girls did some dance moves\nfor him, putting on a show and obviously flirting. She was pretty, with long\nblonde hair and a lowcut top, and Dan didn\u2019t mind in the slightest. </p><p>The emptier the bottles of liquor got, the looser the group.\nSome other people squeezed themselves between the teens on the bed and they\nstarted playing a half-hearted game of Truth or Dare. Dan was tipsy, grinning\nwidely as two girls kissed each other on a dare. The boys cheered, apart from\none who shushed them and told the boy next to Dan, \u201cI dare you to kiss him.\u201d He\npointed at Dan, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d The boy turned to him, \u201cBut I\u2019m a gentleman. I don\u2019t\nkiss people whose names I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dan. My name is Phil.\u201d</p><p>For a second Dan thought about the fact that this boy in\nfront of him was probably the one Eleanor had her eye on. Then his thoughts\nwere interrupted by his lips. </p><p>Phil put his hand on the back of Dan\u2019s neck and pulled him\nin. He kept him close for a good few seconds, and when they finally pulled\napart they grinned at each other. Kissing boys was very different from kissing\ngirls, but not in a bad way. Over Phil\u2019s shoulder Dan saw Eleanor watching\nthem. He mouthed a \u2018sorry\u2019 at her, but as a response she pointed to the boy\nnext to her and shrugged. She\u2019d moved on.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol coursing through his veins, but for\nthe next fifteen minutes Dan was awfully aware of the fact that his leg was\ntouching Phil\u2019s. He kept glancing over to him, and his dumb intoxicated brain\nwas noticing things he usually only noticed in girls. Like the wrinkles by his\neyes when he laughed, and the way he bit the inside of his cheek\nabsentmindedly. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of booze.\u201d A bottle was chucked at the bed and\nsome of the teenagers ducked to dodge it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more in mine and Cal\u2019s room. Dan and I will go get\nit.\u201d Phil didn\u2019t give Dan the chance to speak for himself, simply getting off\nthe bed and expecting him to follow. He did.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Phil pulled a keycard out of his pocket and led\nthem into a room.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man.\u201d</p><p>The room was messy, clothes strewn about the place and an\nopen suitcase lying on one of the beds. </p><p>\u201cYou into guys?\u201d</p><p>It was a sudden question to which the answer should\u2019ve been\na decisive \u2018no\u2019, but Dan found himself shrugging, not able to get the negation\nover his lips after he\u2019d just had those thoughts about this boy\u2019s features. </p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Phil took some bottles out from under a bed and put\nthem on top of the duvet. \u201cYou, included.\u201d</p><p>Dan was flustered but didn\u2019t let it show, \u201cI tend to have\nthat kind of effect on people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you like guys, are you?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug.</p><p>\u201cWant to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose that wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Before he knew it he was backed against the bathroom door\nwith hands on his waist and Phil\u2019s forehead pressed against his own. \u201cI feel\nlike you might be.\u201d Phil said softly, pushing his hips forward.</p><p>Dan\u2019s breath caught in his throat. \u201cConvince me.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed him. Messily and aggressively, with Dan\nstruggling to keep up. </p><p>Fingers teased at the hem of his jumper and caught bits of\nexposed skin here and there. Goosebumps rose up on his abdomen as a familiar\nwarmth tugged at the bottom of his stomach. He finally regathered his own agency,\nlifting his hands and experimentally putting them on Phil\u2019s shoulders first. He\nwasn\u2019t sure where you were supposed to touch a boy when kissing them. Girls\nwere easy: you just touched their boobs. He racked his brain in an attempt to\nremember where girls usually touched him, and eventually just settled for\nrunning his hands down from Phil\u2019s shoulders to his chest, and then down to his\nbelly. He was toned, a dancer\u2019s body, muscles hard under Dan\u2019s fingertips. </p><p>Phil easily took control over him. He\u2019d never expected that\nhe would be so eager to give it up, especially to another boy. </p><p>There was a knock on the door that scared them both out of\ntheir excited daze. Phil backed away, straightening his shirt before checking\nthe peephole, \u201cFriends.\u201d He said. </p><p>Dan picked up the bottles as the other opened the door. A\nfew of the dancers tumbled into the room, grumbling about the lack of alcohol\nin the party room. \u201cSeriously, what\u2019s taking you guys so long?\u201d</p><p>But the girl at the back of the group grinned and winked knowingly\nat Dan when he handed her the liquor. His cheeks turned pink, quickly turning\naway. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming with us?\u201d A boy asked. </p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Phil said, a mischievous smile decorating his\npretty features. He closed the door behind his friends and turned back to Dan,\n\u201cSo, where were we?\u201d</p><p>The interruption had given Dan time to think. A moment for\nhis brain to catch up with what his body had been doing. \u201cEh, maybe we should\nget back to the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Phil didn\u2019t seem disappointed as much as genuinely\nsurprised.</p><p>Dan tugged at the hem of his jumper, \u201cThey\u2019ll think we\nhooked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe can go back if you want. I\u2019ll deny anything happened\nbetween us.\u201d</p><p>It was the Out Dan thought he wanted, but now that it was on\nthe table it didn\u2019t feel right. He glanced at the door. He could leave if he\nwanted; Phil wasn\u2019t keeping him here. But passing up the opportunity to mess\naround with this hot person who was literally offering himself to him, even\nthough that hot person was a guy, felt like a wholly irresponsible decision.\nAnd so he made a dismissive gesture with his hand and said, \u201cWell, they already\nthink we hooked up. Might as well actually do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? We don\u2019t have to do anything if you don\u2019t\nwant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen yourself? Rejecting you would be a crime.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned, \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself.\u201d He stepped\ncloser and reached up, fingers brushing the side of Dan\u2019s neck. That alone was\nenough to make Dan feel like the whole interruption had never happened. He was\nas wound up and desperate as he\u2019d been just a few minutes before, and he\ngrabbed Phil\u2019s hips and pulled him close as he started kissing him. </p><p>This time it didn\u2019t take long for them to stumble towards\nthe bed. Dan fell onto his back, Phil leaning over him on his elbows. They were\nboth more confident now, and Dan slipped his hands under Phil\u2019s shirt without\nhesitating. Guys\u2019 bodies were so different from girls\u2019 bodies and his fingers\nexplored the new landscape. Phil dropped his hips, his lower body now fully leaning\non Dan\u2019s, and the latter could feel his cock twitch against his own through\ntheir jeans. A shiver went up his spine as he pulled him closer. </p><p>Phil rolled off him, and Dan was about to protest when the\nother\u2019s hands moved to his jeans and made quick work of his belt. They were\nboth impatient, pulling at each other\u2019s clothes until they decided to just do\nit themselves. Dan kicked off his jeans and pulled his shirt over his head.\nWhen he looked back to Phil the latter had just pulled a bottle of lube out of\none of the suitcases on the floor. \u201cMove to that bed,\u201d he instructed, \u201cmaking\nout on Ryan\u2019s bed is something, but taking off trousers is a whole other\nthing.\u201d</p><p>They kissed for a few seconds but then Phil was tired of\nwaiting and wrapped his fingers around Dan\u2019s cock. Dan shivered and followed\nhis lead after a moment. He may not know where to put his hands on a boy\u2019s\ntorso, but he definitely knew what to do with his hands near a penis. He moved\nslowly, slower than he would for himself, and softly brushed his thumb over the\ntip. Phil made a sound that echoed through Dan\u2019s body and made his abdomen\ntighten. </p><p>Their foreheads touched, breaths mixing together in the air\nbetween them as they touched each other. Both were too out of breath to kiss,\nbut that didn\u2019t stop them from trying a few times, exchanging sloppy kisses and\nmoaning into them. </p><p>When Dan\u2019s hand started stuttering, Phil pushed him onto his\nback and kissed his way down the boy\u2019s torso as he sped up his hand. </p><p>Dan\u2019s head fell back as he came onto his own stomach,\npanting and grabbing at the sheets. Phil worked him through it until the boy\nunder him relaxed. He took a second to collect himself, then turned his\nattention back to Phil.</p><p>He made quick work of him, leaning over him and moving fast.\nPhil\u2019s hands traced the muscles on his back, and when he got close his nails\ndug into Dan\u2019s skin. Dan didn\u2019t mind, biting his lip and resting his forehead\nin the nook of Phil\u2019s shoulder. He didn\u2019t raise his head until Phil came, and\nhe watched the pleasure wash over him, his jaw slacking and eyes closing. </p><p>Dan rolled off him and for a few minutes they quietly lied\non their backs next to each other. </p><p>\u201cThat was good.\u201d Dan broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil laughed. He reached out and brushed the back of\nDan\u2019s hand with his fingertips. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe I\u2019m kind of into guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m irresistible.\u201d Phil said.</p><p>They pushed themselves up off the bed and headed into the\nbathroom to clean themselves up. They moved slowly, lazily splashing water on\nthemselves and brushing arms whenever they moved by each other. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>When they walked back into the main party room all eyes were\non them, knowing looks being cast their way. Eleanor, now sat on the bed with\nsome girls, grinned at Dan, who returned her grin but averted his gaze quickly.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you have a good night, Lester?\u201d One of the boys shouted.\nSome others cheered and Dan felt his cheeks go red.</p><p>\u201cYeah man, when\u2019s the last time you had a night as fun as\nmine?\u201d</p><p>That shut him right up. There was laughter around the room as\neverything settled down. Dan sat with Eleanor, somehow comforted by her\nfamiliarity. He felt a bit uneasy with the notion that everyone in the room\nknew that he\u2019d just messed around with another guy, even though no one really\nseemed to care that much. Not even Eleanor, surprisingly.</p><p>When he was handed some sort of vodka-and-coke-combination\nhe loosened up, downing it quickly and getting another glass right after. Who\neven cared about whom he had sex with?</p><p>He fell asleep on the bathroom floor at four thirty in the\nmorning.</p>",

On top of it\nbeing close to seven pm, it was also December 23, the day before Christmas Eve.\nTwenty-two teenagers had dragged themselves out of their warm and comfortable\nhouse for the night to go watch some ballet performance of the Nutcracker with\ntheir drama teacher; something they\u2019d signed up for back in September when it\nwas warm out and they were optimistic and excited for Christmas. </p><p>At the back of the line Dan Howell was looking at Snapchats\nof a party he\u2019d been invited to that night. Eleanor Prince was dragging him\nalong by his arm, occasionally looking over his shoulder at his phone screen.\n\u201cHold up, is that Sophie? She said she couldn\u2019t come to the Nutcracker because\nshe\u2019s sick. The bitch.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cNo offense, but if my mum hadn\u2019t literally walked us to the\ndoors I would have done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too late to say I\u2019m sick now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me here alone, El. Tough it out.\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t need to look over to her to know she was rolling her eyes at him.</p><p>At the end of the hallway the Emergency Exit sign lit up\ngreen and dimly illuminated the door below it. They took a left into a\nclassroom just before it, piling onto tables and chatting quietly. The dark and\nsilent school demanded a sort of respect that no one could explain. It felt\nalmost ominous. Ms Collins had apparently not received this memo, as she\nslammed the door so hard every student in the room flinched. \u201cBefore we go to\nthe show, I\u2019d like to discuss the themes and story of the Nutcracker with you\nguys. Have any of you been to a performance before?\u201d</p><p>If teenagers weren\u2019t eager to speak up during actual\nclasses, they sure as hell weren\u2019t on Christmas break. Twenty-two sets of eyes\nwandered purposelessly around the room, avoiding Ms Collins\u2019 stare at every\ncost. \u201cDaniel?\u201d She tried.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He responded curtly.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what it might be about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She moved on to the next person with a hint of desperation,\n\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>With his hand shielding the screen from being spotted by the\nteacher Dan showed Eleanor a string of pictures one of their friends had sent\nhim. From their group, the two of them were the only ones who\u2019d been dumb enough\nto sign up for the trip. Eleanor had even been mildly excited at first,\ncarrying her enthusiasm over to Dan who\u2019d agreed to sign up with her. She was a\nfervent hip-hop dancer and had thought that watching a performance of a\ndifferent type of dance would be cool. That was, however, before she\u2019d learnt\nthat Tia Samson was throwing a party for the entirety of their college that\nexact night. Tia Samson, whose parents owned a record company and who lived in\na penthouse in St John\u2019s Wood. Whom Eleanor had been trying desperately to\nbefriend all year. </p><p>Unfortunately, Eleanor\u2019s parents had entrusted her to the\ncare of Dan\u2019s mum, who had insisted on driving them and even walking them to\nthe building to \u2018make sure they would get inside safe\u2019 because it was dark and\nshe was overprotective. </p><p>In the twenty-five minutes it took Ms Collins to get all the\nanswers she wanted from her unwilling students Dan caught up with exactly what\nhad happened at the party so far. It had started around six with a large pizza\nbuffet orchestrated by the Samsons\u2019 \u2018help\u2019 -which was another word for\n\u2018butler\u2019, really- and as they were finishing up the pizzas Tia was letting\npeople add songs to the playlist for the night and ice cream was being brought\nout. Dan and Eleanor had quickly eaten some pasta before leaving for school and\nreally, life was unfair. </p><p>By the time the group made their way back to the doors\nthrough the dark hallways of Quenten Secondary School Dan was stuffing a Mars\nbar in his mouth that he\u2019d found in his pocket. A sort of silent protest\nagainst Tia\u2019s dumb party and her dumb pizza. </p><p>The school hadn\u2019t even gotten them a bus or anything; they\nhad to walk fifteen minutes to the theatre in the freezing cold. Eleanor hopped\nfrom one leg to the other as they waited for Ms Collins to lock the gates\nbehind them. </p><p>At the front of the group were a couple of kids who seemed\ngenuinely excited to be going to the ballet performance, but most them were\njust angry with themselves for signing up for the thing in the first place.\nThey trotted along the pavement in the dark, hugging themselves for warmth or\nshoving their hands as deep into their pockets as they would go.</p><p>Dan was grumbling to himself but Eleanor paid him no mind.\nShe pulled her woolly hat over her ears and quietly followed the crowd. </p><p>The theatre was beautifully decorated with colourful fairy\nlights and a huge Christmas tree in the front lobby. Dan distractedly ran his\nfingers over the wreath on the front desk while they were being briefed on\nproper behaviour during the show. He was going through the motions without\nlistening- following his classmates to the cloakroom, hanging up his coat, and\nwandering after them to their seats. </p><p>He sensed that now that they were inside and warm Eleanor\nwas starting to get excited again. She upright, slightly leaning over the chair\nin front of her to get a better view of the stage. Dan himself was slouched in\nhis chair, eyes still trained on his phone. \u201cOkay, this is kind of cool.\u201d\nEleanor said after a few minutes, grabbing Dan\u2019s arm and shaking him slightly.\n\u201cPut your phone away, it\u2019ll start soon.\u201d</p><p>He groaned but did as she asked. Truth be told, apart from\nthe fact that it was making him miss Tia Samson\u2019s party, Dan didn\u2019t actually\nhate being there that much. He would never admit that much though, preferring\nto keep his image intact. </p><p>The lights went down. The bottom left of the curtain moved\nslightly, catching Dan\u2019s eye and keeping his gaze there as the stage became\nvisible and the dancers appeared. A boy about his own age with dark hair and a\nbeautiful red blazer stood in the place that had caught Dan\u2019s attention. Dan\nwatched him as he danced for a little while before letting his gaze shift to\nthe other dancers. He didn\u2019t actually know the story of the Nutcracker and\nmaybe he should\u2019ve listened to Ms Collins\u2019 explanation, but it was a little\nlate for that now. \u00a0</p><p>The performance was beautiful, but Dan kept that to himself.\nEleanor was clearly enjoying it too, keeping a tight grasp on his arm and\nshaking him every time one of the dancers did a particularly difficult move.\nThe fact that this was making her so happy was in turn making Dan happy. He\ngrinned and shook his head as she squealed quietly, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d</p><p>When the break started and the lights went on Dan was almost\ndisappointed. Almost. He dug his phone out of his pocket and caught up with the\nparty on snapchat. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a drink. Do you want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a coke please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled his legs under his chair so Eleanor could shuffle\npast him, and he quickly glanced at their classmates around him before\nreturning to his screen. They all seemed to have gotten over their initial\nannoyance with being there, as he and Eleanor had. Ms Collins was engaging a\ncouple of students in a conversation, and for once her subjects did not seem to\nbe completely loathing their existence in that moment.</p><p>At Tia\u2019s party the karaoke machine had been broken out and\nDan watched a shaky recording of his friend Alex singing Africa by Toto. He was\nholding a beer bottle and clearly already tipsy. By the time Dan would be home\nfrom the ballet performance he might just have enough time to get changed and\nhead over there too. He\u2019d missed the dinner and ice cream, but he wasn\u2019t too\nlate to get drunk and sing karaoke. </p><p>Eleanor returned after ten minutes with two bottles of coke\nand a mischievous grin plastered on her face. Dan couldn\u2019t help but raise his\neyebrow at her, \u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got invited to a party by one of the cute dancers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA party? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. They\u2019re having an afterparty at their hotel. Want\nto come?\u201d</p><p>Dan hesitated, glancing back at his phone screen where a new\nsnap from Sophie had just come in. A Tia Samson party was epic, but he\u2019d never\nbeen to a hotel party before, and this might be the only chance he\u2019d get. Plus,\nthere\u2019d be loads of cute girls. Worth it. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Phil at the backdoors about an hour after the\nshow, so that gives us enough time to go home and change. I could even do some\neyeliner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, huh?\u201d Dan laughed, he pulled a face at her and she\nstuck out her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because I\u2019m getting laid tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hook up with someone.\u201d Dan huffed. </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Eleanor said, theatrically flipping her hair over\nher shoulder and taking a sip of her coke.</p><p>\u201cShut up, you\u2019re such a bully.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan\u2019s mum picked the two of them back up after the show. At\nthe theatre, thank God, so they didn\u2019t have to walk the fifteen minutes back to\nschool in the freezing cold. </p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d She asked as they got in the car.</p><p>\u201cSo good, Mrs Howell,\u201d Eleanor beamed, \u201cWe\u2019ve been invited\nto go hang out with the dancers for a bit actually. They\u2019re really lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That sounds fun. Will there be alcohol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of the dancers are of age so they might be\ndrinking, but we won\u2019t, of course.\u201d</p><p>Mrs Howell nodded contently. She had a sweet spot for\nEleanor, and the teenagers loved to use that to their advantage. By the time\nthey got home she had even agreed to pay for an Uber. </p><p>Eleanor slept over so often that she kept a little\ncollection of makeup and clothes in the bottom drawer of Dan\u2019s wardrobe. She\nwas the only girl Dan\u2019s parents would let sleep in his room with him, and\nalthough they probably hoped the two of them would end up together, Dan and\nEleanor shuddered at the thought. They had been friends for as long as Dan\ncould remember and kissing her would be like making out with his twin. </p><p>She sat at his desk as she applied a new layer of mascara.\nDan, long done putting on a clean shirt and running a hand through his hair,\nwas seated on the table beside her makeup, feet propped up on the chair. \u201cWhat\ntime are you coming over tomorrow?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cBefore lunch.\u201d She responded. She blinked a few times and\nheld the pocket mirror closer to her eye. \u201cIt\u2019s not Christmas Eve if I miss\nyour mum\u2019s pigs in blankets.\u201d</p><p>On the day of Christmas Eve Eleanor always came over to eat\npigs in blankets and make Christmas ornaments with Dan and his mum. They\u2019d\nstarted the tradition back when doing crafts with your mum was still cool, but\nby the time they\u2019d grown out of crafts in general, they had also grown attached\nto their tradition. And so the Howells\u2019 tree was filled with homemade\nornaments, and the mantle over the fireplace featured a line-up of clay\nfigurines. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>Just after eleven the Uber dropped them off at the hotel.\nOne of the dancers, Mia Bright picked them up in the lobby and took them\nupstairs to the hallway all their rooms were on. The main party was taking\nplace in the room of the boy who danced the part of the Nutcracker and one of\nthe background dancers. At first glance it looked pretty chilled; teens\nlounging around with drinks and some music playing in the background, but on\ntop of the mini fridge were three bottles of liquor. The night was young and\nthe cards were open.</p><p>Eleanor sat down on the floor with some boys and was\nimmediately handed a drink. Just as Dan was looking around the room to see\nwhere the most girls were gathered, he was invited to join the people on the\nbed. Half boys, half girls. Could be worse. He picked up a beer and leaned back\nagainst the headboard.</p><p>He chatted to them for a while, complimenting them on their\nperformance and asking about their tour. One of the girls did some dance moves\nfor him, putting on a show and obviously flirting. She was pretty, with long\nblonde hair and a lowcut top, and Dan didn\u2019t mind in the slightest. </p><p>The emptier the bottles of liquor got, the looser the group.\nSome other people squeezed themselves between the teens on the bed and they\nstarted playing a half-hearted game of Truth or Dare. Dan was tipsy, grinning\nwidely as two girls kissed each other on a dare. The boys cheered, apart from\none who shushed them and told the boy next to Dan, \u201cI dare you to kiss him.\u201d He\npointed at Dan, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d The boy turned to him, \u201cBut I\u2019m a gentleman. I don\u2019t\nkiss people whose names I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dan. My name is Phil.\u201d</p><p>For a second Dan thought about the fact that this boy in\nfront of him was probably the one Eleanor had her eye on. Then his thoughts\nwere interrupted by his lips. </p><p>Phil put his hand on the back of Dan\u2019s neck and pulled him\nin. He kept him close for a good few seconds, and when they finally pulled\napart they grinned at each other. Kissing boys was very different from kissing\ngirls, but not in a bad way. Over Phil\u2019s shoulder Dan saw Eleanor watching\nthem. He mouthed a \u2018sorry\u2019 at her, but as a response she pointed to the boy\nnext to her and shrugged. She\u2019d moved on.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol coursing through his veins, but for\nthe next fifteen minutes Dan was awfully aware of the fact that his leg was\ntouching Phil\u2019s. He kept glancing over to him, and his dumb intoxicated brain\nwas noticing things he usually only noticed in girls. Like the wrinkles by his\neyes when he laughed, and the way he bit the inside of his cheek\nabsentmindedly. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of booze.\u201d A bottle was chucked at the bed and\nsome of the teenagers ducked to dodge it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more in mine and Cal\u2019s room. Dan and I will go get\nit.\u201d Phil didn\u2019t give Dan the chance to speak for himself, simply getting off\nthe bed and expecting him to follow. He did.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Phil pulled a keycard out of his pocket and led\nthem into a room.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man.\u201d</p><p>The room was messy, clothes strewn about the place and an\nopen suitcase lying on one of the beds. </p><p>\u201cYou into guys?\u201d</p><p>It was a sudden question to which the answer should\u2019ve been\na decisive \u2018no\u2019, but Dan found himself shrugging, not able to get the negation\nover his lips after he\u2019d just had those thoughts about this boy\u2019s features. </p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Phil took some bottles out from under a bed and put\nthem on top of the duvet. \u201cYou, included.\u201d</p><p>Dan was flustered but didn\u2019t let it show, \u201cI tend to have\nthat kind of effect on people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you like guys, are you?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug.</p><p>\u201cWant to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose that wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Before he knew it he was backed against the bathroom door\nwith hands on his waist and Phil\u2019s forehead pressed against his own. \u201cI feel\nlike you might be.\u201d Phil said softly, pushing his hips forward.</p><p>Dan\u2019s breath caught in his throat. \u201cConvince me.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed him. Messily and aggressively, with Dan\nstruggling to keep up. </p><p>Fingers teased at the hem of his jumper and caught bits of\nexposed skin here and there. Goosebumps rose up on his abdomen as a familiar\nwarmth tugged at the bottom of his stomach. He finally regathered his own agency,\nlifting his hands and experimentally putting them on Phil\u2019s shoulders first. He\nwasn\u2019t sure where you were supposed to touch a boy when kissing them. Girls\nwere easy: you just touched their boobs. He racked his brain in an attempt to\nremember where girls usually touched him, and eventually just settled for\nrunning his hands down from Phil\u2019s shoulders to his chest, and then down to his\nbelly. He was toned, a dancer\u2019s body, muscles hard under Dan\u2019s fingertips. </p><p>Phil easily took control over him. He\u2019d never expected that\nhe would be so eager to give it up, especially to another boy. </p><p>There was a knock on the door that scared them both out of\ntheir excited daze. Phil backed away, straightening his shirt before checking\nthe peephole, \u201cFriends.\u201d He said. </p><p>Dan picked up the bottles as the other opened the door. A\nfew of the dancers tumbled into the room, grumbling about the lack of alcohol\nin the party room. \u201cSeriously, what\u2019s taking you guys so long?\u201d</p><p>But the girl at the back of the group grinned and winked knowingly\nat Dan when he handed her the liquor. His cheeks turned pink, quickly turning\naway. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming with us?\u201d A boy asked. </p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Phil said, a mischievous smile decorating his\npretty features. He closed the door behind his friends and turned back to Dan,\n\u201cSo, where were we?\u201d</p><p>The interruption had given Dan time to think. A moment for\nhis brain to catch up with what his body had been doing. \u201cEh, maybe we should\nget back to the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Phil didn\u2019t seem disappointed as much as genuinely\nsurprised.</p><p>Dan tugged at the hem of his jumper, \u201cThey\u2019ll think we\nhooked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe can go back if you want. I\u2019ll deny anything happened\nbetween us.\u201d</p><p>It was the Out Dan thought he wanted, but now that it was on\nthe table it didn\u2019t feel right. He glanced at the door. He could leave if he\nwanted; Phil wasn\u2019t keeping him here. But passing up the opportunity to mess\naround with this hot person who was literally offering himself to him, even\nthough that hot person was a guy, felt like a wholly irresponsible decision.\nAnd so he made a dismissive gesture with his hand and said, \u201cWell, they already\nthink we hooked up. Might as well actually do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? We don\u2019t have to do anything if you don\u2019t\nwant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen yourself? Rejecting you would be a crime.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned, \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself.\u201d He stepped\ncloser and reached up, fingers brushing the side of Dan\u2019s neck. That alone was\nenough to make Dan feel like the whole interruption had never happened. He was\nas wound up and desperate as he\u2019d been just a few minutes before, and he\ngrabbed Phil\u2019s hips and pulled him close as he started kissing him. </p><p>This time it didn\u2019t take long for them to stumble towards\nthe bed. Dan fell onto his back, Phil leaning over him on his elbows. They were\nboth more confident now, and Dan slipped his hands under Phil\u2019s shirt without\nhesitating. Guys\u2019 bodies were so different from girls\u2019 bodies and his fingers\nexplored the new landscape. Phil dropped his hips, his lower body now fully leaning\non Dan\u2019s, and the latter could feel his cock twitch against his own through\ntheir jeans. A shiver went up his spine as he pulled him closer. </p><p>Phil rolled off him, and Dan was about to protest when the\nother\u2019s hands moved to his jeans and made quick work of his belt. They were\nboth impatient, pulling at each other\u2019s clothes until they decided to just do\nit themselves. Dan kicked off his jeans and pulled his shirt over his head.\nWhen he looked back to Phil the latter had just pulled a bottle of lube out of\none of the suitcases on the floor. \u201cMove to that bed,\u201d he instructed, \u201cmaking\nout on Ryan\u2019s bed is something, but taking off trousers is a whole other\nthing.\u201d</p><p>They kissed for a few seconds but then Phil was tired of\nwaiting and wrapped his fingers around Dan\u2019s cock. Dan shivered and followed\nhis lead after a moment. He may not know where to put his hands on a boy\u2019s\ntorso, but he definitely knew what to do with his hands near a penis. He moved\nslowly, slower than he would for himself, and softly brushed his thumb over the\ntip. Phil made a sound that echoed through Dan\u2019s body and made his abdomen\ntighten. </p><p>Their foreheads touched, breaths mixing together in the air\nbetween them as they touched each other. Both were too out of breath to kiss,\nbut that didn\u2019t stop them from trying a few times, exchanging sloppy kisses and\nmoaning into them. </p><p>When Dan\u2019s hand started stuttering, Phil pushed him onto his\nback and kissed his way down the boy\u2019s torso as he sped up his hand. </p><p>Dan\u2019s head fell back as he came onto his own stomach,\npanting and grabbing at the sheets. Phil worked him through it until the boy\nunder him relaxed. He took a second to collect himself, then turned his\nattention back to Phil.</p><p>He made quick work of him, leaning over him and moving fast.\nPhil\u2019s hands traced the muscles on his back, and when he got close his nails\ndug into Dan\u2019s skin. Dan didn\u2019t mind, biting his lip and resting his forehead\nin the nook of Phil\u2019s shoulder. He didn\u2019t raise his head until Phil came, and\nhe watched the pleasure wash over him, his jaw slacking and eyes closing. </p><p>Dan rolled off him and for a few minutes they quietly lied\non their backs next to each other. </p><p>\u201cThat was good.\u201d Dan broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil laughed. He reached out and brushed the back of\nDan\u2019s hand with his fingertips. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe I\u2019m kind of into guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m irresistible.\u201d Phil said.</p><p>They pushed themselves up off the bed and headed into the\nbathroom to clean themselves up. They moved slowly, lazily splashing water on\nthemselves and brushing arms whenever they moved by each other. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>When they walked back into the main party room all eyes were\non them, knowing looks being cast their way. Eleanor, now sat on the bed with\nsome girls, grinned at Dan, who returned her grin but averted his gaze quickly.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you have a good night, Lester?\u201d One of the boys shouted.\nSome others cheered and Dan felt his cheeks go red.</p><p>\u201cYeah man, when\u2019s the last time you had a night as fun as\nmine?\u201d</p><p>That shut him right up. There was laughter around the room as\neverything settled down. Dan sat with Eleanor, somehow comforted by her\nfamiliarity. He felt a bit uneasy with the notion that everyone in the room\nknew that he\u2019d just messed around with another guy, even though no one really\nseemed to care that much. Not even Eleanor, surprisingly.</p><p>When he was handed some sort of vodka-and-coke-combination\nhe loosened up, downing it quickly and getting another glass right after. Who\neven cared about whom he had sex with?</p><p>He fell asleep on the bathroom floor at four thirty in the\nmorning.</p>",

On top of it\nbeing close to seven pm, it was also December 23, the day before Christmas Eve.\nTwenty-two teenagers had dragged themselves out of their warm and comfortable\nhouse for the night to go watch some ballet performance of the Nutcracker with\ntheir drama teacher; something they&rsquo;d signed up for back in September when it\nwas warm out and they were optimistic and excited for Christmas. </p><p>At the back of the line Dan Howell was looking at Snapchats\nof a party he&rsquo;d been invited to that night. Eleanor Prince was dragging him\nalong by his arm, occasionally looking over his shoulder at his phone screen.\n&ldquo;Hold up, is that Sophie? She said she couldn&rsquo;t come to the Nutcracker because\nshe&rsquo;s sick. The bitch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No offense, but if my mum hadn&rsquo;t literally walked us to the\ndoors I would have done the same thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it too late to say I&rsquo;m sick now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not leaving me here alone, El. Tough it out.&rdquo; He\ndidn&rsquo;t need to look over to her to know she was rolling her eyes at him.</p><p>At the end of the hallway the Emergency Exit sign lit up\ngreen and dimly illuminated the door below it. They took a left into a\nclassroom just before it, piling onto tables and chatting quietly. The dark and\nsilent school demanded a sort of respect that no one could explain. It felt\nalmost ominous. Ms Collins had apparently not received this memo, as she\nslammed the door so hard every student in the room flinched. &ldquo;Before we go to\nthe show, I&rsquo;d like to discuss the themes and story of the Nutcracker with you\nguys. Have any of you been to a performance before?&rdquo;</p><p>If teenagers weren&rsquo;t eager to speak up during actual\nclasses, they sure as hell weren&rsquo;t on Christmas break. Twenty-two sets of eyes\nwandered purposelessly around the room, avoiding Ms Collins&rsquo; stare at every\ncost. &ldquo;Daniel?&rdquo; She tried.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; He responded curtly.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea what it might be about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>She moved on to the next person with a hint of desperation,\n&ldquo;Katie?&rdquo;</p><p>With his hand shielding the screen from being spotted by the\nteacher Dan showed Eleanor a string of pictures one of their friends had sent\nhim. From their group, the two of them were the only ones who&rsquo;d been dumb enough\nto sign up for the trip. Eleanor had even been mildly excited at first,\ncarrying her enthusiasm over to Dan who&rsquo;d agreed to sign up with her. She was a\nfervent hip-hop dancer and had thought that watching a performance of a\ndifferent type of dance would be cool. That was, however, before she&rsquo;d learnt\nthat Tia Samson was throwing a party for the entirety of their college that\nexact night. Tia Samson, whose parents owned a record company and who lived in\na penthouse in St John&rsquo;s Wood. Whom Eleanor had been trying desperately to\nbefriend all year. </p><p>Unfortunately, Eleanor&rsquo;s parents had entrusted her to the\ncare of Dan&rsquo;s mum, who had insisted on driving them and even walking them to\nthe building to &lsquo;make sure they would get inside safe&rsquo; because it was dark and\nshe was overprotective. </p><p>In the twenty-five minutes it took Ms Collins to get all the\nanswers she wanted from her unwilling students Dan caught up with exactly what\nhad happened at the party so far. It had started around six with a large pizza\nbuffet orchestrated by the Samsons&rsquo; &lsquo;help&rsquo; -which was another word for\n&lsquo;butler&rsquo;, really- and as they were finishing up the pizzas Tia was letting\npeople add songs to the playlist for the night and ice cream was being brought\nout. Dan and Eleanor had quickly eaten some pasta before leaving for school and\nreally, life was unfair. </p><p>By the time the group made their way back to the doors\nthrough the dark hallways of Quenten Secondary School Dan was stuffing a Mars\nbar in his mouth that he&rsquo;d found in his pocket. A sort of silent protest\nagainst Tia&rsquo;s dumb party and her dumb pizza. </p><p>The school hadn&rsquo;t even gotten them a bus or anything; they\nhad to walk fifteen minutes to the theatre in the freezing cold. Eleanor hopped\nfrom one leg to the other as they waited for Ms Collins to lock the gates\nbehind them. </p><p>At the front of the group were a couple of kids who seemed\ngenuinely excited to be going to the ballet performance, but most them were\njust angry with themselves for signing up for the thing in the first place.\nThey trotted along the pavement in the dark, hugging themselves for warmth or\nshoving their hands as deep into their pockets as they would go.</p><p>Dan was grumbling to himself but Eleanor paid him no mind.\nShe pulled her woolly hat over her ears and quietly followed the crowd. </p><p>The theatre was beautifully decorated with colourful fairy\nlights and a huge Christmas tree in the front lobby. Dan distractedly ran his\nfingers over the wreath on the front desk while they were being briefed on\nproper behaviour during the show. He was going through the motions without\nlistening- following his classmates to the cloakroom, hanging up his coat, and\nwandering after them to their seats. </p><p>He sensed that now that they were inside and warm Eleanor\nwas starting to get excited again. She upright, slightly leaning over the chair\nin front of her to get a better view of the stage. Dan himself was slouched in\nhis chair, eyes still trained on his phone. &ldquo;Okay, this is kind of cool.&rdquo;\nEleanor said after a few minutes, grabbing Dan&rsquo;s arm and shaking him slightly.\n&ldquo;Put your phone away, it&rsquo;ll start soon.&rdquo;</p><p>He groaned but did as she asked. Truth be told, apart from\nthe fact that it was making him miss Tia Samson&rsquo;s party, Dan didn&rsquo;t actually\nhate being there that much. He would never admit that much though, preferring\nto keep his image intact. </p><p>The lights went down. The bottom left of the curtain moved\nslightly, catching Dan&rsquo;s eye and keeping his gaze there as the stage became\nvisible and the dancers appeared. A boy about his own age with dark hair and a\nbeautiful red blazer stood in the place that had caught Dan&rsquo;s attention. Dan\nwatched him as he danced for a little while before letting his gaze shift to\nthe other dancers. He didn&rsquo;t actually know the story of the Nutcracker and\nmaybe he should&rsquo;ve listened to Ms Collins&rsquo; explanation, but it was a little\nlate for that now. &nbsp;</p><p>The performance was beautiful, but Dan kept that to himself.\nEleanor was clearly enjoying it too, keeping a tight grasp on his arm and\nshaking him every time one of the dancers did a particularly difficult move.\nThe fact that this was making her so happy was in turn making Dan happy. He\ngrinned and shook his head as she squealed quietly, &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo;</p><p>When the break started and the lights went on Dan was almost\ndisappointed. Almost. He dug his phone out of his pocket and caught up with the\nparty on snapchat. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a drink. Do you want something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, a coke please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan pulled his legs under his chair so Eleanor could shuffle\npast him, and he quickly glanced at their classmates around him before\nreturning to his screen. They all seemed to have gotten over their initial\nannoyance with being there, as he and Eleanor had. Ms Collins was engaging a\ncouple of students in a conversation, and for once her subjects did not seem to\nbe completely loathing their existence in that moment.</p><p>At Tia&rsquo;s party the karaoke machine had been broken out and\nDan watched a shaky recording of his friend Alex singing Africa by Toto. He was\nholding a beer bottle and clearly already tipsy. By the time Dan would be home\nfrom the ballet performance he might just have enough time to get changed and\nhead over there too. He&rsquo;d missed the dinner and ice cream, but he wasn&rsquo;t too\nlate to get drunk and sing karaoke. </p><p>Eleanor returned after ten minutes with two bottles of coke\nand a mischievous grin plastered on her face. Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but raise his\neyebrow at her, &ldquo;What are you smiling at?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got invited to a party by one of the cute dancers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A party? When?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tonight. They&rsquo;re having an afterparty at their hotel. Want\nto come?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan hesitated, glancing back at his phone screen where a new\nsnap from Sophie had just come in. A Tia Samson party was epic, but he&rsquo;d never\nbeen to a hotel party before, and this might be the only chance he&rsquo;d get. Plus,\nthere&rsquo;d be loads of cute girls. Worth it. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m meeting Phil at the backdoors about an hour after the\nshow, so that gives us enough time to go home and change. I could even do some\neyeliner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, huh?&rdquo; Dan laughed, he pulled a face at her and she\nstuck out her tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just jealous because I&rsquo;m getting laid tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hook up with someone.&rdquo; Dan huffed. </p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Eleanor said, theatrically flipping her hair over\nher shoulder and taking a sip of her coke.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, you&rsquo;re such a bully.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s mum picked the two of them back up after the show. At\nthe theatre, thank God, so they didn&rsquo;t have to walk the fifteen minutes back to\nschool in the freezing cold. </p><p>&ldquo;How was it?&rdquo; She asked as they got in the car.</p><p>&ldquo;So good, Mrs Howell,&rdquo; Eleanor beamed, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been invited\nto go hang out with the dancers for a bit actually. They&rsquo;re really lovely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? That sounds fun. Will there be alcohol?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A couple of the dancers are of age so they might be\ndrinking, but we won&rsquo;t, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs Howell nodded contently. She had a sweet spot for\nEleanor, and the teenagers loved to use that to their advantage. By the time\nthey got home she had even agreed to pay for an Uber. </p><p>Eleanor slept over so often that she kept a little\ncollection of makeup and clothes in the bottom drawer of Dan&rsquo;s wardrobe. She\nwas the only girl Dan&rsquo;s parents would let sleep in his room with him, and\nalthough they probably hoped the two of them would end up together, Dan and\nEleanor shuddered at the thought. They had been friends for as long as Dan\ncould remember and kissing her would be like making out with his twin. </p><p>She sat at his desk as she applied a new layer of mascara.\nDan, long done putting on a clean shirt and running a hand through his hair,\nwas seated on the table beside her makeup, feet propped up on the chair. &ldquo;What\ntime are you coming over tomorrow?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Before lunch.&rdquo; She responded. She blinked a few times and\nheld the pocket mirror closer to her eye. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Christmas Eve if I miss\nyour mum&rsquo;s pigs in blankets.&rdquo;</p><p>On the day of Christmas Eve Eleanor always came over to eat\npigs in blankets and make Christmas ornaments with Dan and his mum. They&rsquo;d\nstarted the tradition back when doing crafts with your mum was still cool, but\nby the time they&rsquo;d grown out of crafts in general, they had also grown attached\nto their tradition. And so the Howells&rsquo; tree was filled with homemade\nornaments, and the mantle over the fireplace featured a line-up of clay\nfigurines. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Just after eleven the Uber dropped them off at the hotel.\nOne of the dancers, Mia Bright picked them up in the lobby and took them\nupstairs to the hallway all their rooms were on. The main party was taking\nplace in the room of the boy who danced the part of the Nutcracker and one of\nthe background dancers. At first glance it looked pretty chilled; teens\nlounging around with drinks and some music playing in the background, but on\ntop of the mini fridge were three bottles of liquor. The night was young and\nthe cards were open.</p><p>Eleanor sat down on the floor with some boys and was\nimmediately handed a drink. Just as Dan was looking around the room to see\nwhere the most girls were gathered, he was invited to join the people on the\nbed. Half boys, half girls. Could be worse. He picked up a beer and leaned back\nagainst the headboard.</p><p>He chatted to them for a while, complimenting them on their\nperformance and asking about their tour. One of the girls did some dance moves\nfor him, putting on a show and obviously flirting. She was pretty, with long\nblonde hair and a lowcut top, and Dan didn&rsquo;t mind in the slightest. </p><p>The emptier the bottles of liquor got, the looser the group.\nSome other people squeezed themselves between the teens on the bed and they\nstarted playing a half-hearted game of Truth or Dare. Dan was tipsy, grinning\nwidely as two girls kissed each other on a dare. The boys cheered, apart from\none who shushed them and told the boy next to Dan, &ldquo;I dare you to kiss him.&rdquo; He\npointed at Dan, who shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; The boy turned to him, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a gentleman. I don&rsquo;t\nkiss people whose names I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Dan. My name is Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>For a second Dan thought about the fact that this boy in\nfront of him was probably the one Eleanor had her eye on. Then his thoughts\nwere interrupted by his lips. </p><p>Phil put his hand on the back of Dan&rsquo;s neck and pulled him\nin. He kept him close for a good few seconds, and when they finally pulled\napart they grinned at each other. Kissing boys was very different from kissing\ngirls, but not in a bad way. Over Phil&rsquo;s shoulder Dan saw Eleanor watching\nthem. He mouthed a &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; at her, but as a response she pointed to the boy\nnext to her and shrugged. She&rsquo;d moved on.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol coursing through his veins, but for\nthe next fifteen minutes Dan was awfully aware of the fact that his leg was\ntouching Phil&rsquo;s. He kept glancing over to him, and his dumb intoxicated brain\nwas noticing things he usually only noticed in girls. Like the wrinkles by his\neyes when he laughed, and the way he bit the inside of his cheek\nabsentmindedly. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of booze.&rdquo; A bottle was chucked at the bed and\nsome of the teenagers ducked to dodge it.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more in mine and Cal&rsquo;s room. Dan and I will go get\nit.&rdquo; Phil didn&rsquo;t give Dan the chance to speak for himself, simply getting off\nthe bed and expecting him to follow. He did.</p><p>&ldquo;You good?&rdquo; Phil pulled a keycard out of his pocket and led\nthem into a room.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, man.&rdquo;</p><p>The room was messy, clothes strewn about the place and an\nopen suitcase lying on one of the beds. </p><p>&ldquo;You into guys?&rdquo;</p><p>It was a sudden question to which the answer should&rsquo;ve been\na decisive &lsquo;no&rsquo;, but Dan found himself shrugging, not able to get the negation\nover his lips after he&rsquo;d just had those thoughts about this boy&rsquo;s features. </p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Phil took some bottles out from under a bed and put\nthem on top of the duvet. &ldquo;You, included.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was flustered but didn&rsquo;t let it show, &ldquo;I tend to have\nthat kind of effect on people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sure if you like guys, are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Another shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to find out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Suppose that wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>Before he knew it he was backed against the bathroom door\nwith hands on his waist and Phil&rsquo;s forehead pressed against his own. &ldquo;I feel\nlike you might be.&rdquo; Phil said softly, pushing his hips forward.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s breath caught in his throat. &ldquo;Convince me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil kissed him. Messily and aggressively, with Dan\nstruggling to keep up. </p><p>Fingers teased at the hem of his jumper and caught bits of\nexposed skin here and there. Goosebumps rose up on his abdomen as a familiar\nwarmth tugged at the bottom of his stomach. He finally regathered his own agency,\nlifting his hands and experimentally putting them on Phil&rsquo;s shoulders first. He\nwasn&rsquo;t sure where you were supposed to touch a boy when kissing them. Girls\nwere easy: you just touched their boobs. He racked his brain in an attempt to\nremember where girls usually touched him, and eventually just settled for\nrunning his hands down from Phil&rsquo;s shoulders to his chest, and then down to his\nbelly. He was toned, a dancer&rsquo;s body, muscles hard under Dan&rsquo;s fingertips. </p><p>Phil easily took control over him. He&rsquo;d never expected that\nhe would be so eager to give it up, especially to another boy. </p><p>There was a knock on the door that scared them both out of\ntheir excited daze. Phil backed away, straightening his shirt before checking\nthe peephole, &ldquo;Friends.&rdquo; He said. </p><p>Dan picked up the bottles as the other opened the door. A\nfew of the dancers tumbled into the room, grumbling about the lack of alcohol\nin the party room. &ldquo;Seriously, what&rsquo;s taking you guys so long?&rdquo;</p><p>But the girl at the back of the group grinned and winked knowingly\nat Dan when he handed her the liquor. His cheeks turned pink, quickly turning\naway. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not coming with us?&rdquo; A boy asked. </p><p>&ldquo;No thanks.&rdquo; Phil said, a mischievous smile decorating his\npretty features. He closed the door behind his friends and turned back to Dan,\n&ldquo;So, where were we?&rdquo;</p><p>The interruption had given Dan time to think. A moment for\nhis brain to catch up with what his body had been doing. &ldquo;Eh, maybe we should\nget back to the party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Phil didn&rsquo;t seem disappointed as much as genuinely\nsurprised.</p><p>Dan tugged at the hem of his jumper, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think we\nhooked up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mind that?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;We can go back if you want. I&rsquo;ll deny anything happened\nbetween us.&rdquo;</p><p>It was the Out Dan thought he wanted, but now that it was on\nthe table it didn&rsquo;t feel right. He glanced at the door. He could leave if he\nwanted; Phil wasn&rsquo;t keeping him here. But passing up the opportunity to mess\naround with this hot person who was literally offering himself to him, even\nthough that hot person was a guy, felt like a wholly irresponsible decision.\nAnd so he made a dismissive gesture with his hand and said, &ldquo;Well, they already\nthink we hooked up. Might as well actually do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure? We don&rsquo;t have to do anything if you don&rsquo;t\nwant to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen yourself? Rejecting you would be a crime.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil grinned, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so bad yourself.&rdquo; He stepped\ncloser and reached up, fingers brushing the side of Dan&rsquo;s neck. That alone was\nenough to make Dan feel like the whole interruption had never happened. He was\nas wound up and desperate as he&rsquo;d been just a few minutes before, and he\ngrabbed Phil&rsquo;s hips and pulled him close as he started kissing him. </p><p>This time it didn&rsquo;t take long for them to stumble towards\nthe bed. Dan fell onto his back, Phil leaning over him on his elbows. They were\nboth more confident now, and Dan slipped his hands under Phil&rsquo;s shirt without\nhesitating. Guys&rsquo; bodies were so different from girls&rsquo; bodies and his fingers\nexplored the new landscape. Phil dropped his hips, his lower body now fully leaning\non Dan&rsquo;s, and the latter could feel his cock twitch against his own through\ntheir jeans. A shiver went up his spine as he pulled him closer. </p><p>Phil rolled off him, and Dan was about to protest when the\nother&rsquo;s hands moved to his jeans and made quick work of his belt. They were\nboth impatient, pulling at each other&rsquo;s clothes until they decided to just do\nit themselves. Dan kicked off his jeans and pulled his shirt over his head.\nWhen he looked back to Phil the latter had just pulled a bottle of lube out of\none of the suitcases on the floor. &ldquo;Move to that bed,&rdquo; he instructed, &ldquo;making\nout on Ryan&rsquo;s bed is something, but taking off trousers is a whole other\nthing.&rdquo;</p><p>They kissed for a few seconds but then Phil was tired of\nwaiting and wrapped his fingers around Dan&rsquo;s cock. Dan shivered and followed\nhis lead after a moment. He may not know where to put his hands on a boy&rsquo;s\ntorso, but he definitely knew what to do with his hands near a penis. He moved\nslowly, slower than he would for himself, and softly brushed his thumb over the\ntip. Phil made a sound that echoed through Dan&rsquo;s body and made his abdomen\ntighten. </p><p>Their foreheads touched, breaths mixing together in the air\nbetween them as they touched each other. Both were too out of breath to kiss,\nbut that didn&rsquo;t stop them from trying a few times, exchanging sloppy kisses and\nmoaning into them. </p><p>When Dan&rsquo;s hand started stuttering, Phil pushed him onto his\nback and kissed his way down the boy&rsquo;s torso as he sped up his hand. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s head fell back as he came onto his own stomach,\npanting and grabbing at the sheets. Phil worked him through it until the boy\nunder him relaxed. He took a second to collect himself, then turned his\nattention back to Phil.</p><p>He made quick work of him, leaning over him and moving fast.\nPhil&rsquo;s hands traced the muscles on his back, and when he got close his nails\ndug into Dan&rsquo;s skin. Dan didn&rsquo;t mind, biting his lip and resting his forehead\nin the nook of Phil&rsquo;s shoulder. He didn&rsquo;t raise his head until Phil came, and\nhe watched the pleasure wash over him, his jaw slacking and eyes closing. </p><p>Dan rolled off him and for a few minutes they quietly lied\non their backs next to each other. </p><p>&ldquo;That was good.&rdquo; Dan broke the silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Phil laughed. He reached out and brushed the back of\nDan&rsquo;s hand with his fingertips. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Maybe I&rsquo;m kind of into guys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m irresistible.&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>They pushed themselves up off the bed and headed into the\nbathroom to clean themselves up. They moved slowly, lazily splashing water on\nthemselves and brushing arms whenever they moved by each other. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>When they walked back into the main party room all eyes were\non them, knowing looks being cast their way. Eleanor, now sat on the bed with\nsome girls, grinned at Dan, who returned her grin but averted his gaze quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you have a good night, Lester?&rdquo; One of the boys shouted.\nSome others cheered and Dan felt his cheeks go red.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah man, when&rsquo;s the last time you had a night as fun as\nmine?&rdquo;</p><p>That shut him right up. There was laughter around the room as\neverything settled down. Dan sat with Eleanor, somehow comforted by her\nfamiliarity. He felt a bit uneasy with the notion that everyone in the room\nknew that he&rsquo;d just messed around with another guy, even though no one really\nseemed to care that much. Not even Eleanor, surprisingly.</p><p>When he was handed some sort of vodka-and-coke-combination\nhe loosened up, downing it quickly and getting another glass right after. Who\neven cared about whom he had sex with?</p><p>He fell asleep on the bathroom floor at four thirty in the\nmorning.</p>",
